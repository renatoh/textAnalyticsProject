The Cameroon international yesterday called on journalists and white footballers to help stamp out the problem after another weekend tainted by racist chanting in La Liga. When asked whether a black referee could ever take charge of a primera divisi\u00f3n game, Eto'o said: \"What? A referee here like the black referees in England? If one arrived here, then they would kill him. \"I thought the racist chanting was just a fad, but it seems to be becoming more widespread and more vitriolic.\" Asked what could be done to combat racism, Eto'o said: \"It is the journalists and the white players who can send the strongest messages. A white player like Deco celebrating with me when I score is a powerful message, and journalists have to write about it.\" Eto'o was on the receiving end of abuse on Saturday after monkey taunts reverberated around Real Zaragoza's La Romareda stadium following his goal in Barca's 4-1 win. The 17-goal striker responded by imitating a monkey. \"People paid for their tickets to see a monkey and so I did it. I am an actor on the pitch,\" he said. \"Each time this happens then I will do it.\" Preparations for the 2006 World Cup finals are being put at risk by the match-fixing scandal engulfing Germany. Franz Beckenbauer, chairman of the organising committee, said yesterday: \"The work is at a standstill while we put out one fire after another.\" The German Football Association (DFB) has been forced to focus on the Robert Hoyzer match-fixing case since suspicions were raised on January 19. Many senior members of the World Cup committee also hold DFB posts. Hoyzer, who admits fixing several matches, was arrested on Saturday after prosecutors said there was evidence his involvement may have begun before 2004."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
