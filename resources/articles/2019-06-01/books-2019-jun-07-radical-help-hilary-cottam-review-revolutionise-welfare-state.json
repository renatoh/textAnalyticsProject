The postwar welfare state (\u201can original and brilliant experiment\u201d) is unable to deal with the reality of modern life: it has become a \u201cmanagement state\u201d in which 80% of the resource is spent on gate-keeping. A fundamental change is needed in which \u201cthe emphasis is not on managing need but on creating capability\u201d. In 2006 she founded Participle, an organisation that designed and tested ways of enabling people to live \u201ca good life\u201d in the 21st century. For 10 years she worked with social workers, anthropologists and digital experts on experimental programmes that highlighted areas the original welfare state was not designed to address \u2013 families locked out of society, the transition into adulthood (the word \u201cteenager\u201d didn\u2019t exist in William Beveridge\u2019s day), modern diseases such as depression, obesity, diabetes and stress, the challenges raised by an ageing population. Working with thousands of participants, they tested solutions aimed not at managing problems but at helping people \u201cto grow their capabilities: to learn, to work, to live healthily and to connect to one another\u201d. Once people were given the means to take control of their lives, they embraced the challenge, made changes and improved their circumstances. She even saved the state money. An inspiring book that highlights the importance of building relationships in society and the need to \u201ckeep the human in view\u201d, rather than reducing people to units or caseloads. \u2022 Radical Help: How We Can Remake the Relationships Between Us and Revolutionise the Welfare State is published by Virago (RRP \u00a39.99) .
