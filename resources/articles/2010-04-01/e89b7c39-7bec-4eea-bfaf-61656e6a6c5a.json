And out they all went, the good, the bad and the indifferent mingled together without distinction, the saints with the sinners, the impossibly grand alongside the humble. Much the same verdict has now been reprised, just as indiscriminately, in the case of the House of Commons dissolved today. So it is hardly surprising that the number deciding to quit the place is much the highest since 1945. Some are going because they've been personally tarred as rogues and scoundrels and owners of moats and duck houses; some because they know if they do so now they will qualify for golden farewells that will no longer \u2013 thanks to expenses reform \u2013 be available to departing MPs if they stay one more term; but others because they know there are other ways of earning a living which offer more practical opportunities and do not incur such blanket contempt. What is striking here is the number of the departed, particularly the Labour departed, who have served less than 15 years. In the last big clear-out (four-fifths the size of this one) in 1997, nearly 60% of those who gave up had served between 18 and 27 years. This time, 50% of Labour departers have been there for at most 13. A disconcerting proportion of the contingent that arrived with such high excitement in the year of Tony Blair's triumph has abandoned the place. That includes some once marked out for the highest office: Ruth Kelly, in the cabinet at 36, leaving at 41 to spend more time with her family; also Stephen Byers, once regarded as an exceptional talent, now likely to be remembered for a line about cab ranks. An even more disconcerting casualty is James Purnell, elected at 31 in 2001, in the cabinet at 37, yet giving up at 40. It is unsettling that men like Mr Purnell, along with such stars of the 1992 intake as John Hutton and Alan Milburn, no longer see a future in political life \u2013 at least on the Labour benches. There are others too who merit some kind of salute. They include backbenchers resolutely determined to think for themselves, such as Andrew MacKinlay; old hands still in tune with Labour's working-class origins, like Dick Caborn, Mick Clapham and Ian McCartney; MPs useful in office but perhaps even more so when out of it, such as Chris Mullin and Kim Howells; and MPs denied government office who have greatly enhanced the work of select committees, notably the assiduous campaigner for House of Commons reform Tony Wright and the calm and sensible chair of the Treasury committee, John McFall. Clare Short will be remembered with gratitude for her time at the Department for International Development. On the Conservative side, where departures are fewer, you do not need to share Ann Widdecombe's politics to admire her independence and feistiness. The now largely forgotten John Gummer was way ahead of his party in thinking green (and may continue to do so from the Lords). David Howarth, who is returning, frustrated by the impotence of Westminster, to academic life, is a loss to the Liberal benches. Adam Price, who is leaving for Harvard, has had an impressive run as a Plaid Cymru MP. Michael Howard, Ian Paisley and Alex Salmond were all party leaders; John Prescott, a merchant seaman, rose to be deputy prime minister. Many MPs stay too long. It is good that the next House of Commons should be younger than the last one, less romantically attached to outdated conventions, thirstier for reform. Yet venerable heads will survive here and there, if the voters permit. Gerald Kaufman, Dennis Skinner and David Winnick and Austin Mitchell are not done yet; nor is Sir Peter Tapsell, destined to be father of the house and perhaps the best available bet to celebrate his 100th birthday in it \u2013 hopefully, in a Commons so effectively changed that people of talent and dedication are once more eager to stay there."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
