Don't read ahead if you haven't seen episode eight yet. Playing poker with coyotes More mystery and mental wrangling with questions of time and space, and free will in the long term. And in this short term? More mortal danger, of course. What happened: In the wake of Al's death, the world asked questions about the possibility of changing the future, the bureau attempted to band together \u2026 and Benford went on a dirty weekend with his wife, the heartless swine. Then, the team discovered a man with a three-star tattoo Mark had seen in his flashforward, so they set a trap and, when he possibly pulled a gun, they shot him. Mark think this changes his future. Sadly, we discovered, there's a lot of three-star tattoos out there. And they don't appear to be etched on very nice people. In other news, Lloyd Simcoe and slimy Simon; poisonous Scientist (or The Slimontist, for short) played poker to decide whether they should admit culpability for the flashforward and its consequence. Lloyd won. So they will now tell \u2013 in theory. But where are we now? \"The future can be changed\", read the headlines on all the world's papers, although that's a little premature: you'd want to get to the future and check that that was the case before saying that for sure, one would imagine. Nevertheless, it was very much a theme this week, whether to use free will to act out against the visions or to use it to slavishly stick to them. Mark killed a bad man he believed might might slay him in a few months' time \u2013 Janis, meanwhile, actively started seeking sperm donors for her as-yet non-baby. The new danger seems to come from these three-star nasty gang, though. They not only appear to be powerful and evil, but also very impolite, shooting each other to death when small talk becomes too difficult. Luckily, of course, they won't last long, not if they keep shooting each other \u2013 and also, when Mark realises there's more than one three-star tattoo in the world \u2026 because he's losing his hold on right and wrong, it seems. Did Mark shoot him because he thought he was an immediate threat? Or because he believed that this was what Al died to prove: that you can change the future by killing everyone now who might cause an issue for you later on? Morally, this may turn dodgy. I don't feel like this week moved us on substantially after last, though. And one of the continued problems is Benford: leading agent, leading man. Fiennes, I find, is presenting a completely hollow man and unlovable hero. It's not that he's bad, just that he's blank. Is anyone else finding anything to hang onto with his character? Flashes \u2022 Lloyd sent his email to a group of culpable people sharing the address @nlap.us.com. A quick check raises several possibilities: (a) National Laboratory Audit Program (maybe?); (b) Northern Lakes Accommodation Providers (a Cumbrian tourist board \u2013 unlikely); and (c) Nebraska Lawyers Assistance Program (yes! That one! Lawyers, eh?) \u2022 Is there really no suspicion in Benford's mind that more than one person can have the same tattoo? Has he never seen the myriad butterfly tattoos of London town on display on a Friday night? \u2022 The soundtrack of rousing bland guitar music leaves much to be desired. I'm not sure quite how much more MOR rock I can stand. \u2022 A minor point, but annoying: as evidenced by Olivia, people seem to have mainly had flashforwards in third person, an external look at their future selves (thus her underwear revelation), but lots of other people remember information they were reading, which would be first person. How many angles can one see the future from? Discuss."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
