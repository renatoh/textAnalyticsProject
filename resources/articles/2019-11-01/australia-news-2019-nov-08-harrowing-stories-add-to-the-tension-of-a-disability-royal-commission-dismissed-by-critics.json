As the disability royal commission landed in Townsville for its first public hearings, it was trailed by some advocates who argue the process is, if not set up to fail, at least not exactly equipped to succeed. Those critics, such as the Greens senator Jordon Steele-John, say people with disabilities have not been given enough time and support to safely and effectively engage with the commission. Steele-John was in Townsville when the commission chair, Ronald Sackville, appeared to return serve as he officially opened the hearings: \u201cUnfortunately there are one or two commentators whose contributions often appear calculated to discourage people from telling their stories to the commission and to increase their levels of anxiety.\u201d It was against this tense backdrop that the three-year, $527m inquiry began. Its first four days were dedicated to education and learning in Queensland, which last year became the first state to embrace an \u201cinclusive education\u201d policy. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of happenstance that education and learning has been selected as the first topic for hearing in public hearings,\u201d said counsel assisting the commission Kerri Mellifont. \u201cEducation is a key enabler of other rights including those related to work, housing, political participation and access to justice. Education sets the scene.\u201d And set the scene it did. Across four days the commissioners heard harrowing stories from two parents of students with disabilities. They also heard from experts and teachers in Queensland\u2019s system and the state\u2019s education department. The Queensland mother of a 13-year-old girl with Down\u2019s syndrome was the first witness. Known as witness AAA, she described her daughter as a \u201cgreat learner\u201d who was \u201chappy\u201d and \u201cindependent\u201d. She does have vision and intellectual impairments but she can also cook half a dozen meals from a recipe and do her own washing. When her daughter reached year two at school, things changed. Witness AAA became emotional as she told how her daughter became \u201cpetrified\u201d of her teacher. The teacher regularly yelled at the child, forced her to sit on a bathmat, and once dragged her down a flight of stairs. After three years the family was left with no choice but to withdraw her from the school. It was not a unique story. Mellifont read from submissions that spoke to the horror inflicted on some children who had faced bullying, harassment and exclusion in mainstream schools. One 10-year-old girl with Asperger syndrome was hit over the head, pushed from a pier and began hiding in a garbage bin to avoid bullying. But it was not always about abuse. Some parents simply could not find a school that would accept their child due to an unofficial practice called \u201cgatekeeping\u201d. Dr Lisa Bridle, a disabilities expert, told the commission: \u201cThe things that are said to families are either, \u2018We don\u2019t cater for students with this level of disability\u2019, \u2018We won\u2019t have the resources; we can\u2019t ensure that your child will be safe if they enrol at this school. You will find the resources are somewhere else.\u2019 \u201d Another witness, known as AAC, spoke about her experience putting five children with disabilities through the education system. She described her eldest son who has autism as \u201cgifted\u201d but said the teachers \u201cweren\u2019t really of the understanding that he required adjustments\u201d. \u201cThe bullying was so extreme that he actually took a knife to school because he was that scared,\u201d she said. The abuse experienced by the witnesses\u2019s children occurred in mainstream schools. But the existence \u2013 and ethics \u2013 of special schools appears likely to feature as a key question the commission may seek to answer. Bridle argues, as do peak bodies People With Disability Australia and Children and Young People with Disability Australia, that these schools are discriminatory. Some parents have described them as segregation, but others say they support their existence. \u201cWhat if there are parents who want to have a separate school for their children?\u201d Sackville asked Bridle. She replied: \u201cI absolutely understand why families would want to have their child at a special school \u2026 I think when families do not feel their child will be welcomed, they don\u2019t feel their child will be safe, they don\u2019t feel their child will be kind of supported, the schools are set up in rigid ways so they don\u2019t think their child\u2019s sensory needs will be kind of accommodated.\u201d The Queensland teacher\u2019s union backed the special schools. \u201cIf you make blanket decision to take away special schools as an option, it denies the system and parents and those students one of the suite of options for providing effective education in a state school system,\u201d its president, Kevin Bates, said. Teachers had it tough, he said. \u201cThe expectations of a single teacher are often beyond the capacity of a single human being to deliver.\u201d Under the Queensland government\u2019s policy, schools are told to introduce students with disabilities into the classrooms. In a session with specialist disability teachers, the commission was told at least one school was actively \u201cresisting diversity\u201d. But Catherine Morris, head of special education services at Bowen high school, said her school had taken a different approach. \u201cEvery one of those students attends mainstream classrooms,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery one of those students accesses the curriculum at their level. Every one of those students receives the support they require for their complex needs. \u201cThey attend all and participate in all school events. And they are definitely valued members of our school community.\u201d Asked to react to a hypothetical in which special schools were phased out in 15 years, the Queensland\u2019s government\u2019s legal counsel, Kathryn McMillan QC, promised to take the question on notice: \u201cBut can I say that one thing that perhaps is troubling, if I can put it this way at this stage, is there really hasn\u2019t been any other side of the debate, if I can put it this way, about special schools.\u201d There were no witnesses with disabilities to give evidence in the first week and that was not lost on the community. Responding to Sackville\u2019s apparent criticism at \u201ccommentators\u201d like him, Steele-John told the ABC this week: \u201cI\u2019ve just had a long conversation with a man who would desperately like to give his evidence to the commission but cannot do so yet because there isn\u2019t a pathway to make confidential submissions to the inquiry presently.\u201d Sackville closed the week\u2019s first hearings with an anecdote. He said one of the disability royal commissioners was riding in a cab this week when the driver, apparently surprised, asked why Townsville was chosen as the site for the first public hearings. It was no mere random selection. Demographic data shows the region has a relatively high proportion of people with disability. And the locals had shown strong interest in community forums leading up to the first hearings. \u201cThe choice of these locations reflects the national character of our inquiry,\u201d Sackville said. \u201cWe intend to go well beyond the capital cities of the eastern states.\u201d It was a signal that the commission desperately wants to reach out to a disability community that, at least in some quarters, views the way the inquiry has been created with some wariness. If this week is any guide, it won\u2019t be an easy task. The royal commission will reconvene next month in Melbourne for public hearings into group homes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
