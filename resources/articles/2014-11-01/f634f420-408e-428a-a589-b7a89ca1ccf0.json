Don\u2019t read on if you haven\u2019t seen series five, episode eight. Read Viv Groskop\u2019s episode seven blog here. What? You have got to be kidding me. After all that, the bloody dog is already dead? And we\u2019re expected to behave as if we know about it and don\u2019t mind? I had to check twice that I was not watching the wrong episode. Pet\u2019s tombstones? What? This is offensive. One minute Rose is getting engaged and Isis is a bit poorly. (OK, she had a cancer diagnosis. But I assumed that would turn out to be wrong.) Now Rose is virtually pregnant and divorced. And Isis is four feet under. RIP Isis. Gone and already forgotten. (But not by this blog.) This feature-length finale was, even by Downton\u2019s standards, odd. But also oddly pleasing. Like watching a pilot for a completely different TV series that just happened to feature some of the characters and plot lines from Downton Abbey. It felt like a big set-up for the recently announced series six and/or the Christmas special. Denker is evidently the new O\u2019Brien. Jailbird Anna is the new Bates. Dame Maggie is the new Rose. Several thousand new plotlines surfaced and were put to bed in this blink-and-you\u2019ve-missed-it outing. Denker is doing suspicious things with the new footman! Daisy is thinking about leaving! The police keep coming to interview Anna! The Ill-Defined Suitor is getting married! Who cares! Where\u2019s the other Ill-Defined Suitor when you need him? As usual, the strongest moments were the intimate scenes that erupted into sudden violence or repressed passion. Shrimpy did well here: \u201cGet down, you cat!\u201d But the business with the caught-in-clinch-with-Stringfellows-stripper photographs? Just not believable. I can\u2019t help thinking that in the mid 1920s this would have been: a) very difficult to arrange for a grumpy, impoverished aristocratic woman recently arrived from India, and b) far more of a scandal. Rose behaved as if a dodgy selfie had been posted on Facebook. Back at the house, the police came to visit for the 485th time. Not Sergeant Willis again. He has virtually moved in. \u201cWe hoped this was over.\u201d \u201cSo did I , Mr Bates.\u201d So did we all. These are very strange policemen who interview four people at the same time and keep asking Mrs Hughes what she thinks about everything. Although really that\u2019s fair enough as Mrs Hughes is The All-Seeing Eye Who Knows Everything. It was only a matter of time before Anna found herself in the nick, with nary an ill-defined contraceptive device to keep her company. \u201cTake your place in the line.\u201d No! Not Anna! Don\u2019t pick out No.1! It was not Anna, it was Keyser Soze. It has been an entire series of \u201cWho pushed Mini-Den under the bus?\u201d If the Christmas Special doesn\u2019t answer the question once and for all, I will throw a mince pie at the television, one with Uncle Julian\u2019s name iced on it. That will be the second one. The first one was for Matthew and the bakery truck. The ridiculous business of (the otherwise wonderful) Mrs Patmore and the memorial was finally, finally resolved. Would the Earl of Grantham really talk to the cook about this? And would he really have commissioned the stone? Oh, who cares, when we can see Mrs Patmore emote like Meryl Streep in Sophie\u2019s Choice, topped off with a double-take for the Earl of Grantham as he inspects the Edith Doppelganger Deja-Vu Impostor Child. Some lovely stolen moments. A beautiful scene between Dame Maggie and Penelope Wilton about lost chances. Loved the mention of Sybil and her evening pyjamas. Enjoyed the affection between Rose and her father: \u201cThis is where I become his wife.\u201d And there was a nostalgic reminder of the relationship between Mary and Carson, which we haven\u2019t seen for a while. I really, really wanted Denker to turn out to be a massive predatory cougar. But she just liked a free drink. After watching this programme for five series, don\u2019t we all? Random subplot alert Big up Daisy\u2019s Marxist-feminist revolution! \u201cLondon is full of possibilities ... Sometimes I think my life has no possibilities at all ... I feel as if I\u2019ve been down a coal-hole and someone\u2019s opened a lid and brought me into the sunlight ... \u201d PARKLIFE! \u201cI could get a job in London ... I\u2019m handing in my notice ... There\u2019s a whole world out there ...\u201d PARKLIFE! What? Daisy can\u2019t leave! She doesn\u2019t know how to do anything apart from spout Wikipedia quotes she has picked up from Molesley and the Uppity Schoolteacher. Thankfully she realised this herself before the end of the episode. Not before we had witnessed great emotion from Mrs Patmore. \u201cI am crying because I don\u2019t want you to leave. I\u2019ll miss you ... Don\u2019t concern yourself. I\u2019ll get over it.\u201d If she cries any more the spinach souffle will turn sour. Surprise character development The Russian Silver Fox is back! And he\u2019s a sucker for a lavender day dress. \u201cI wish to spend my final years with you. As a friend. As a lover. I don\u2019t seek scandal. Only love.\u201d Blimey. What a face on Dame Maggie! She looked 21 years old again. If this isn\u2019t a wedding on the Christmas special, I will throw an entire box of mince pies at the television, all iced with the words \u201cGratuitous Emotional Heightening\u201d. (I am a whizz with the piping bag.) Golden eyebrow of the week award Mary wins this week. And so takes the golden tweezer award for the entire series. All thanks to her dismissal of the waiter in Rules when he was interrupting the obscene photographs to take the order: \u201cAre you ready to order?\u201d \u201cMay we have a few more moments?\u201d But the expression on her face when Mrs Hughes announced that Anna was about to be arrested? Open-mouth, high-browed. Priceless. Close runner-up: the Earl of Grantham\u2019s expression of quivering disgust when he realised that Edith has birthed a child by the Disappeared-to-Germany-and-Now-Dead Editor. Excuse me, could you just repeat that awkward line of dialogue? \u2022 \u201cWhy does she have to carry on as if she\u2019d invented motherhood?\u201d Queen Bitch is not impressed by Edith\u2019s Gina Ford act. \u2022 \u201cThere\u2019s fun to be had around here if you know where to look for it.\u201d Is Denker angling to be Thomas\u2019s pimp? \u2022 \u201cDivorce signifies weakness, degradation, scandal, failure.\u201d Don\u2019t sit on the fence, Lord Sinderby! \u2022 \u201cDo you find it difficult to get staff?\u201d \u201cNot really. But, then, we\u2019re Jewish. So we pay well.\u201d Rose\u2019s new mother-in-law is a total dude. \u2022 \u201cDon\u2019t tell Edith you\u2019ve guessed.\u201d Seeing as the Earl of Grantham doesn\u2019t seem to have told anyone that Isis is dead, I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll have any trouble keeping the secret of Marigold. Next week There is no next week. Isis\u2019s backside has waggled for the last time. (Or has it? Will they change the opening credits?) Series six has been commisioned and filming begins soon. Coming next: the ITV charity sketch with Hugh Bonneville and George Clooney. And the Christmas special, which is traditionally scheduled at the time on Christmas Day when you are just about to fall into a sherry coma. Which is appropriate, really."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
