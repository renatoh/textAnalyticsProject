When voters find politicians' promises less plausible than the riff of a snake oil salesman, it makes arguing the case for a colossal infrastructure project like HS2 intensely difficult. This summer, it has begun to carry the aura of a lost cause, impossibly expensive, politically catastrophic, assailed on all sides except the two frontbenches at Westminster. Yesterday, though, the case in favour came out of intensive care and the transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, finally started to sound like a man who believes in his own project. There's a long way to go to convince the doubters, and a lot of work to do if he's to produce as near to a watertight case as can be made for a project that is unavoidably speculative. The Whitehall record of efficient and transparent management of multibillion-pound works is too patchy, and the most recent National Audit Office report too damning, to feel entirely confident. The higher the costs, the finer the balance between pressing on and giving up. Now officially \u00a342.6bn, it is certainly a huge commitment, though a lot less than some of the wilder projections. Nor is it true to say, as critics have, that investing so much in a single project risks absorbing cash needed for other transport developments. Mr McLoughlin promises that by 2021 an even vaster amount \u2013 \u00a356bn \u2013 will have gone into projects like more lanes on crowded motorways and local rail improvements. And, as he points out, the \u00a342bn includes a \u00a314bn contingency fee that the risk-averse Treasury has demanded, which is likely to come down as the details of the project are refined. Yet the profusion of different cost estimates is just one example of how clumsily the politics of HS2 have been managed: all summer, the case has been undermined by questionable assertions about the economic benefits of faster journey times, and unquantified claims about the power of major infrastructure projects to generate growth. When two of its big early sponsors, the former chancellor Alistair Darling and ex-business secretary Peter Mandelson, started public rumination about the robustness of their original analysis and even Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, agreed cost had to be a factor, the sense of confidence draining away was almost palpable. Yesterday, Mr McLoughlin reminded his audience of the case in favour, the need for more capacity to meet demand that's rising so fast that the west coast mainline will be full by 2021. It's often overlooked that taking high-speed long-distance trains off the existing line would greatly increase the capacity for freight and local commuter trains. Critics argue more local track and connectivity improvements would deliver better value for money than one single project. But it's worth remembering that HS2 was originally the brainchild of Labour's Andrew Adonis, the minister who oversaw the final stages of the \u00a39bn upgrade of the west coast line \u2013 a costly and disruptive project that led only to a relatively small increase in capacity. Meanwhile, calculating the wider economic impacts is a study in its infancy. According to one estimate of the wider economic benefits of HS1, which links London and Dover, an extra \u00a310bn has been generated in other development and new jobs. But there is no readily transferable scientific formula there to overwhelm the sceptics. At the height of the outpourings of the detractors, Lord Adonis, who remains a passionate advocate of the scheme, wrote that to abandon it would be an act of national self-mutilation. He is right to highlight Britain's lamentable record in taking big, long-term decisions, and to argue the case for political leadership. Cross-party support is important too \u2013 but that carries its own danger. Voters are rightly sceptical when politicians agree. So to carry the day there must be more rigorous, accountable management. No shortcuts, no wishful thinking. Nothing that looks remotely like snake oil."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
