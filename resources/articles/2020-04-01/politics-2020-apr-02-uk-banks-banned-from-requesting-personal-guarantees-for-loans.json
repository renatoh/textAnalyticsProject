With the rapid increase in the number of universal credit claims suggesting many small companies have already collapsed since the economy was locked down, Sunak combined a new package of support for business with a warning to banks that they had to move more quickly. Sunak announced his \u00a3330bn coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (CBILS) \u2013 under which the government underwrites loans to companies \u2013 just over two weeks ago, but has now been forced to admit that support was not arriving quickly enough and was failing to reach all the companies that required it. The chancellor said that under the revised plan: Lenders would be banned from requesting personal guarantees \u2013 which mean borrowers often have to put their homes on the line \u2013 on loans under \u00a3250,000. The loan scheme would be extended so that it covered all small companies affected by Covid-19 and not just those unable to get commercial funding. There would be a new scheme to bolster support for larger firms not currently eligible for loans, under which the government would provide a guarantee of 80% so that banks could make loans of up to \u00a325m to firms with an annual turnover of between \u00a345m and \u00a3500m. The Treasury said the chancellor would be speaking to bank chief executives next week to discuss how the schemes are working and \u201censure everybody is playing their part\u201d. Sunak, the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, and the interim head of the Financial Conduct Authority, Christopher Woolard, told UK banking chiefs last month to take \u201call action necessary\u201d to make sure government-backed loans were benefiting households and businesses as planned. The chancellor said: \u201cThis is a national effort and we\u2019ll continue to work with the financial services sector to ensure that the \u00a3330bn of government support, through loans and guarantees, reaches as many businesses in need as possible.\u201d While the government\u2019s official line is that great progress is being made in providing much-needed support to businesses that have been badly affected by the closure of large chunks of the economy, the chancellor has listened to the employers\u2019 bodies calling for the scheme to be more comprehensive, less bureaucratic and speedier. Adam Marshall, director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \u201cWe\u2019re pleased that the chancellor is listening and responding to the real-world concerns posed by firms across the UK who are urgently trying to access financial support.\u201d Mike Cherry, national chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: \u201cThe most immediate issue threatening the survival of millions of small businesses and the self-employed is severely depleted cash flow. Time is of the essence and therefore we welcome government action in ensuring that any viable small business that has been negatively impacted by the coronavirus can now directly access CBILS rather first being offered a bank\u2019s own standard commercial lending product. \u201cRemoving personal guarantees for all commercial loans below \u00a3250k is also very welcome. Taking on debt at the current time is a daunting prospect for many small businesses and the self-employed.\u201d Sunak said that since the CBILS had been announced \u00a390m of business interruption loans had been approved for nearly 1,000 firms and \u00a31.9bn corporate finance provided to firms hit by Covid-19. \u201cWe are making great progress on getting much-needed support out to businesses to help manage their cashflows during this difficult time \u2013 with millions of pounds of loans and finance being provided to hundreds of firms across the country,\u201d the chancellor said. \u201cAnd now I am taking further action by extending our generous loan scheme so even more businesses can benefit. We have also listened to the concerns of some larger businesses affected by Covid-19 and are announcing new support so they can benefit too.\u201d Gerard Lyons, senior fellow at the Policy Exchange thinktank and a policy adviser to Boris Johnson when he was London\u2019s mayor, said: \u201cIn a fast-moving environment it should be no surprise that policy has to continue to evolve. Speed, scale and simplicity are of the utmost importance to follow through on the measures to date. In particular banks either must engage 100% in the process or be bypassed with the government giving grants to firms to ensure they survive.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
