Some may only have a short story; not everyone has that much to say. Soft Cell: Say Hello, Wave Goodbye (BBC Four) profiled a group still beloved on the basis of one big hit and a handful of dark synthpop albums \u2013 but this disenchantingly muted film made Soft Cell\u2019s brief flash of light seem duller. The tale began in classic fashion, introducing two outsiders in seaside towns \u2013 Marc Almond in Southport, Dave Ball in Blackpool \u2013 dreaming of other worlds. Then, at Leeds Poly in the late 70s, the pair met and bonded over loving Donna Summer and Johnny Rotten equally \u2013 though the exact style clash that would make them famous had seeded in Ball\u2019s brain back at home. Blackpool clubs pumped out Northern Soul records such as Tainted Love by Gloria Jones; then Ball heard the future-facing electronica of Kraftwerk. The affable Ball \u2013 rotund, guffawing, the last bloke down the pub you\u2019d suspect of being in a provocative 80s synth duo \u2013 was the chief raconteur, so unburdened by the huge success of Soft Cell\u2019s 1981 cover of Tainted Love that he doesn\u2019t mind doing the double handclap for the cameras when he hears it. You might expect the unshowy cheeriness of the grafter behind the keyboards to be flamboyantly offset by Almond, whose appearance on Top of the Pops started a run of obviously-if-not-officially-gay 80s singers who comforted and emboldened sexually confused kids watching at home. The real story of Soft Cell \u2013 the tension between their Smash Hits cover-star status and their true identity as a difficult experimental art project \u2013 is on their debut album, Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret, which includes the wedding-disco staple Tainted Love but is otherwise a forbiddingly sparse, slightly off-key exploration of horrid bedsits and filthy Soho romance. The documentary covered that, along with how, after getting lost in the druggy arts scene of New York, Soft Cell released a stardom-repelling second album and an even more obscure third before their creative energy ran out and they disbanded. But if any of it happened in a vivid way that separates them from other burnouts, the film didn\u2019t illustrate it. Evocative archive footage was scarce, and Almond the showman didn\u2019t care to colourfully explain. The talking heads weren\u2019t much help either: at one point someone read out a postcard they\u2019d received from Almond at the apex of his fame on which he\u2019d written \u2026 nothing of note. Even the duo\u2019s split, trailed early on in the programme as acrimonious, was dealt with in a few level-headed sentences. Their 40th-anniversary reunion concert at London\u2019s O2 Arena last year appeared to go off without incident. No fascinatingly fraught rapprochements layered with resentments here, \u00e0 la Bros or Culture Club. Soft Cell just got on with the gig. Good for them! Bad for a rockumentary. A meander through the pair\u2019s post-band careers reinforced the fact that they are odd footnotes in pop. Ball formed banjo-infused novelty house outfit the Grid, while Almond spent time in France and Russia, still reliant on cover versions, singing each country\u2019s native ballads. He quoted a line from No\u00ebl Coward\u2019s Private Lives about the potency of a cheap song, to sum up what his work has always been about. The show closed with the O2 full of nostalgic fans singing along to Say Hello, Wave Goodbye, the one truly potent cheap song Almond and Ball wrote. This is more than most pop groups manage, but not much more. When they\u2019d finished performing it, Soft Cell waved goodbye, politely."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
