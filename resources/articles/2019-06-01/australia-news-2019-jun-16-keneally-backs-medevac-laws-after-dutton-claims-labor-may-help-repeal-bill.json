On Sunday the home affairs minister said that more than 30 people have come to Australia under the medevac bill and gave new details about the refugee swap deal with the United States, including that two Rwandans accused of murder are the only people to have come to Australia under the deal. Labor and the crossbench combined to pass the medevac bill in February over Coalition objections and Scott Morrison promised to repeal it if re-elected. Keneally, the shadow home affairs minister, and Labor leader Anthony Albanese have flagged they will continue to support the medevac legislation, despite the party\u2019s shock loss on 18 May. It will be subject to review by caucus, as with all policy taken to the 2019 election. On Sunday Dutton said the legislation creates \u201cquite a broad power\u201d to overrule the minister and order medical transfers. \u201cI understand Labor is reconsidering its position now and that they would be open to suggestions about how that bill could be repealed or at the very least wound back,\u201d he told ABC\u2019s Insiders. Keneally told Guardian Australia that Labor supports medevac because \u201cit provides a way for people who are sick to get the care they need and ensures minister has final discretion as to who can come\u201d but did not rule out consideration of amendments. \u201cWhat Mr Dutton\u2019s comments today misconstrued is that second aspect of the legislation \u2013 he did not recognise the fact the parliament explicitly ensured the minister retained that discretion. \u201cIf the government seeks to repeal medevac they need to explain to the parliament why that is necessary.\u201d Earlier, Dutton claimed the Coalition\u2019s harsh policies towards asylum seekers have been a success, with the number of refugees and asylum seekers on Manus Island and Nauru falling from 2,000 to just over 800. \u201cI want people off Manus and Nauru overnight, but I want to do it in a way that doesn\u2019t restart boats, kids drowning at sea et cetera,\u201d he said, citing people smuggling ventures in Sri Lanka to support the claim boats could restart. Dutton revealed that \u201cjust over 30\u201d asylum seekers have been brought to Australia under medevac, but said \u201cmany hundreds of people\u201d who required medical attention had been taken off Manus and Nauru under pre-existing provisions. Keneally said the fact dozens of people had come to Australia using the medevac provisions and other processes suggests the Morrison government \u201cseems to have come to a belated realisation that, while Labor and the broader community supports Operation Sovereign Borders, Australians do not like the idea of their government denying sick people the medical care they need\u201d. Dutton revealed that 531 people have gone from Manus and Nauru to the United States under a controversial refugee swap deal, with a further 295 \u201cin the pipeline, where they\u2019ve got approvals but they haven\u2019t been uplifted yet\u201d. The home affairs minister said he did not believe 1,250 people would be sent to the US \u2013 the upper limit under the deal negotiated by the Turnbull government \u2013 because \u201cthere have been over 300 that have been rejected by the United States for various reasons\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s 95 people who have either withdrawn from consideration or rejected an offer. And that\u2019s a concern as well.\u201d Dutton denied that Australia was obliged to take refugees from the US under the deal, but said it has had \u201cseparate discussions\u201d to help the US with special cases that are \u201cvery hard, intractable in some circumstances\u201d. In May the Australian government was rocked by a report from Politico that Australia gave humanitarian protection to Leonidas Bimenyimana and Gregoire Nyaminani, two Rwandan men who had been charged with murder, on request from the US government. Dutton told Insiders the Australian government doesn\u2019t have \u201cplans to bring any others from America at this stage\u201d. \u201cBut we\u2019ll look at discussions with the US, UK, Canada, New Zealand \u2013 our closest partners \u2026 into the future we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d Dutton said he was \u201cnot sure\u201d the two men were guilty of killing tourists with machetes \u2013 which they confessed to under torture \u2013 and said the Australian government \u201cwill not take someone who is a risk to the Australian people\u201d. Dutton said the government had acted on the advice of experts with \u201cfull information\u201d including Australian Border Force and US intelligence agencies. Asked about the controversial $423m contract given to security contractor Paladin in Papua New Guinea, Dutton said it was an issue for the home affairs department whether it would be renewed in two weeks. He said the \u201clikely arrangement is that there will be a continuation\u201d of the Paladin contract."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
