Sylvia Auton", "bodyText": "Job: chief executive, IPC Media Age: 55 Industry: publishing Staff: 2,200 2003 ranking: 98 As chief executive of IPC, Sylvia Auton is in charge of the country's biggest consumer magazine group. Its number one title, What's On TV sells, 1.65 million copies while other best sellers Now, Chat, Woman and TV Times each boast a circulation of more than 500,000. Its latest launch, weekly lads' mag Nuts has the edge over its Emap rival Zoo and is selling in excess of 200,000 copies a week. Not bad for a market that didn't exist this time last year. But apart from Nuts, IPC has been relatively becalmed since Ms Auton took control two years ago. Like Emap, the emphasis has been on bigger but fewer launches, with one new major title expected later this year. It is no easy task following in the footsteps of her predecessor, Sly Bailey, who impressed the City by delivering solid financial results and clinched the sale of the company to AOL Time Warner for \u00a31.15bn in 2001. Nevertheless, IPC is the market leader in 16 of the 35 sectors in which it operates. Other flagship titles include Country Life, Ideal Home and Loaded. Unlike Emap, IPC will not be diversifying into TV or radio. \"We are first and foremost a magazine publisher,\" said Ms Auton, who was promoted to the top job after heading up IPC's country and leisure division. One of her key tasks remains dealing with the political baggage that comes with being part of American media giant Time Warner, as well as wanting to make her mark on the UK media scene. \"When I took the job my commitment was that IPC would be in better shape than it was before I took the role,\" she said. \"Now my commitment is that we will be in a stronger place at the end of 2004 than we were in 2003 in terms of profits, successful launches and growth.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
