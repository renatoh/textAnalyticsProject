John Sleightholme, who is also the deputy coroner for north Yorkshire, will be the club's new chairman, joined on the board by the financier Jeremy Keith and the marketing and communications entrepreneur Steve Harding. The trio completed the transaction within hours of Derby County Ltd appointing a receiver yesterday and have raised the \u00a315m through re-financing. Most of that will be used to repay the \u00a320m-plus debts built up with the Co-operative Bank and the financial institution Lombard. The deal signals the end of Lionel Pickering's nine-year involvement with the club, although it is unclear whether the new owners have taken over his \u00a39m worth of personal guarantees. Those consisted of \u00a35.5m to the Co-op Bank and \u00a33.5m with Lombards for the club's new training complex. It is also unknown how much Pickering was paid for his 53.5% shareholding in the club. The details will be revealed today when Sleightholme and his partners attend a media conference and reveal their plans for arresting the club's decline that has followed its relegation from the Premiership 18 months ago. \"It will take time to put Derby back on the right path - but that is our aim,\" said Sleightholme, who was called to the bar in 1982. Liverpool's manager G\u00e9rard Houllier yesterday insisted that there is no crisis at the club, although he is aware that failure to secure a place in the Champions League could undermine his position. \"We are still making progress, and a few headlines won't take us away from our vision,\" he said. Tottenham are optimistic that scans of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9's damaged ankle will show no serious damage after he was carried off at Leicester. \"We don't think there is anything broken,\" said the caretaker manager David Pleat. Arsenal have agreed to extend Jermaine Pennant's loan to Leeds by a month but Everton's Swedish midfielder Niclas Alexandersson has rejected the chance to extend his spell at West Ham."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
