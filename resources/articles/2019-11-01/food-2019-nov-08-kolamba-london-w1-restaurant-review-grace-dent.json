Diners who might once have known curry simply as something that\u2019s vivid red or fragrant brown and hails roughly from India now know a Malaysian laksa from a Thai massaman, or a katsu from a scotch bonnet-laden curry goat. Recently, more of us have been turned on to the joys of Sri Lanka. Kari and rich sambol served with a crisp, rice-and-coconut crepe, possibly with an egg baked into its base \u2013 an egg hopper \u2013 and smeared with sticky chutney. It\u2019s a godly combination that, once tasted, you\u2019ll wonder where it has been all your life. Patently, Sri Lankan food has been cooked lovingly in Wembley, Tooting and East Ham for decades, but it was the opening three years ago of the very much adored Hoppers in Soho that shoved Sri Lankan cuisine blinking into the \u201ccool food\u201d spotlight. I\u2019m always curious how people feel when their cuisine is declared cool. I say this with some sympathy, as a Cumbrian woman who has spent 20 years shouting: \u201cThat is not Cumberland sausage!\u201d at London menus. \u201cIt\u2019s the wrong shape and it needs 10 times more black pepper.\u201d Safe to say, however, that Kolamba\u2019s owners Eroshan and Aushi Meewella\u2019s reaction to Sri Lanka being \u201cincredibly now, darling\u201d has been to open this lovely new spot just off Regent Street, to showcase the food they remember from their childhood in Kolamba (that\u2019s the Sinhalese name for Colombo, Sri Lanka\u2019s capital). Colombo is home to people of Sinhalese, Tamil, Moor, Burgher and Malay descent. From the moment you walk through the door at Kolamba, it all feels very personal, as if the owners\u2019 hearts are ablaze on their sleeves, eager to show the best of the street snacks, family dinners and teatime treats they remember from home. Each dish is a patchwork of people, places and things. A small plate of delicious fish cutlets from the \u201cBites\u201d section of the menu are more akin to gefilte fish balls, formed from pilchards and potato, spiced and breadcrumbed. They\u2019re a throwback from when the Dutch landed in Point Pedro and stayed for another 156 years. We eat sweet, flaky jackfruit patties and a small plate of Aunty Mo\u2019s chatti roast \u2013 beef dry-fried with chilli, tomato and onion, served on buttery, string hoppers rice noodles. If we\u2019d simply stayed with the snacks section and ordered multiple cutlets, it would have been equally joyous. Instead, we ranged across the curries, sambols and hoppers, ordering too much until the table heaved. A judiciously seasoned, sunset-yellow monkfish curry was followed by a bowl of parippu \u2013 red split lentils cooked in coconut and turmeric \u2013 that has made me rethink my entire lentil dal game. Why do my lentils never taste as rich and nuanced, yet soothing? How have I tried 876 dal recipes off the internet and still produce lacklustre stodge that pleases no one? Is this God\u2019s way of making me book a fact-finding expedition to Colombo? We also ate our way through prawns fried in crushed black pepper and green chilli, and Kolamba\u2019s hoppers, which are delicate, spongy and yielding in all the correct places. The diced tomato sambol with lime juice, green chilli and red onion is so very good, it would go with literally anything. Each time our server tried to make room on the table, we fought to keep hold of precious slicks of date and lime chutney, and ordered extra portions of the rather tough but useful pol roti coconut flatbread, which the menu describes as \u201crustic\u201d and which does the job of reaching the puddles of runny egg yolk, coconut smears and cardamom-scented sauces that no fork or spoon can reach. After a Kolomba-colada \u2013 think pi\u00f1a colada made with vanilla-infused Ceylon arrack and cinnamon \u2013 we drank a bottle of Bastion De La Cit\u00e9 Ros\u00e9, not caring a damn for wine etiquette or the fact that I was dressed in a quilted jacket and snow boots. The pudding list is short, so we ate more hoppers, these ones drizzled in smoky kithul treacle. Kolamba is a small, independent, family-run Sri Lankan restaurant, within running and hiding distance of Oxford Street. They cook from scratch and want to teach you 100 new things about Sri Lanka, and they are offering big, bold lessons from a small, faraway island. You\u2019d be daft not to take them up on it. \u2022 Kolamba 21 Kingly Street, London W1, 020-3815 4201. Open Tues-Fri, noon-3pm, 5.30-10.30pm; Sat &amp; Sun, noon-10.30pm.
