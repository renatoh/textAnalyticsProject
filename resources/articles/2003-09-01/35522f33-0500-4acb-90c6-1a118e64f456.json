Memory tends to be biased towards the most recent performances. This time the spanner in the works may prove to be Martin Bicknell, whose honest swing bowling on his home ground played such a part in England's series-squaring victory on Monday. Two weeks ago a twanging hamstring and an indifferent performance in the fourth Test at Headingley had threatened to cut short his return to the side after a decade away, with a priority to furthering his business - organising corporate golf days - once the season was over. Now, though, his name will have been discussed alongside those of Steve Harmison, Matthew Hoggard, James Kirtley, Kabir Ali and Richard Johnson, and perhaps even Martin Saggers, as suitable accompaniments to James Anderson in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka before Christmas. In a party of 16 there will probably be room for four front-line seamers with the understanding that the chances of more than two accompanying Andrew Flintoff in any one game are remote. As with previous trips to Pakistan and Sri Lanka, these tours will have an educational purpose - the sort that completed Darren Gough's bowling education - and it is this understanding that could give Harmison a fuller winter than he might otherwise have had. The Durham fast bowler produced his best bowling for England at The Oval, showing for the first time the potential in which so much time and effort have been invested. Clearly he is viewed as a major Test bowler for a long time to come. However, there is a conundrum. Those bowlers who succeed on the subcontinent are the ones who embrace the culture of a full length and learn the mysteries of reverse swing. It is not, as Andy Caddick discovered and Harmison might, a place to bang the ball in back of a length and hope. So logic says that Harmison should be stood down until the Caribbean in March. However, if he is to be such a crucial player for England, it is important that he learns how to bowl on all types of pitches, beginning in Bangladesh. As an investment for the future, then, he should go, along with Anderson, Hoggard and Kirtley, another who will benefit from the education. It means that Bicknell's dream must come to an end, but at his pace he would find it hard on pitches where the shine on the ball lasts no longer than a nanosecond. Graham Thorpe's utterly ruthless century has confirmed his status as a top batsman, and unquestionably the England batting order is the sturdier for his presence. His enthusiastic demeanour after the match suggested a light ness that was not merely down to the adrenalin of the moment. Cricket, he seems to be saying, is important to him but not the be all and end all it once was. It will help his cause that as a potential member of the Test squad alone his periods away from home, the source of so much distress in the past, will be limited. Essentially he will become a commuter. Provided the selectors, and Michael Vaughan, feel that the presence of a former captain of such influence will not hinder his own development as a leader, a top five of Marcus Trescothick, Vaughan, Mark Butcher, Nasser Hussain and Thorpe is reassuring, if scarcely progressive. In Test matches Flintoff will move up a place, but there is room in the party for one more specialist. One idea, should there be a temptation to move either the captain or Trescothick down the order (Trescothick is a tremendous player of spin now, and it could make sense to keep him away from Chaminda Vaas, for example) is for the Middlesex captain Andrew Strauss to come in. However, Butcher could readily deputise as an opener if it came to it (unlikely anyway) and a more probable choice would be Paul Collingwood, who would have got a chance this summer had he not dislocated a shoulder. If it would be tough on Ed Smith, then an early assessment of his technique is that it does not stand up to scrutiny at the top level. Alec Stewart is irreplaceable, but the post-Gaffer era seems certain to start with Chris Read behind the stumps and his deputy (there has to be one because of the subcontinent's potential for overnight disruption of the digestive system) coming from a list that would include Geraint Jones, Jonathan Batty, Matthew Prior and the forgotten man, James Foster. Jones is this month's flavour. The dearth of spin has not dissipated, but England must make do with what they can muster. Two will play in each Test and three will be required. Because Gareth Batty has been summoned into the squad on several occasions this summer it is reasonable to assume he will come in to join Ashley Giles and that the third will either be Gary Keedy, the Lancashire left armer, or Glamorgan's Robert Croft, who bowled so well in Sri Lanka two winters ago. Possible squad : Vaughan, Trescothick, Butcher, Hussain, Thorpe, Collingwood, Flintoff, Read, Jones, Giles, Batty G, Croft, Anderson, Harmison, Hoggard, Kirtley. Robert Croft Age: 33. Caps: 21 Having played the last of his Tests two years ago, the Glamorgan off-spinner has emerged as a contender almost by default. Picking him would hardly represent progress but competition is slack and he bowled well during England's successes in Sri Lanka last time. He has always been more productive abroad, where he has enjoyed bowling in tandem with Giles. Graham Thorpe Age: 34.Caps: 78 An emotional return for the prodigal, establishing his credentials in the most emphatic way. England will have doubts only on his commitment to another winter away having havered so much in the past, with the possible effect any slump into depression will have on team morale a definite issue. He will be able to commute between Test series, however. Has the captain's seal of approval and looks a certainty to go. Steve Harmison Age: 24. Caps: 11 His back-of-a-length style will not prove successful on subcontinental feather-bed pitches and he could reasonably be rested until the Caribbean next spring. However, it is important that he learns how to bowl in all conditions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
