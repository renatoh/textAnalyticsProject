He is playing Albinoni's Adagio while outside a queue of people wait to buy bread. Seconds later, a shell explodes in the marketplace and they are killed. The cellist stands at the window all night and all the next day. After 24 hours, he carries his cello down to the carnage-strewn street. He positions a stool in a crater and begins once again to play the Adagio. He goes on to do this every day for 22 days, one day for each victim. Arrow believes she's different from the snipers on the hills around the city. She shoots only soldiers; they kill unarmed civilians. While Arrow is pursued through the city, and the cellist plays in the ruins, Kenan is collecting water from the brewery for his family and neighbour. He dare not take his household to help for fear they will be killed by the snipers. If he dies, what will happen to his family? The last of Galloway's four characters, the baker Dragan, lives mostly in the past. He no longer knows which is the real Sarajevo: the one he sees today or the one in his memories, 'where people were happy, treated each other well, lived without conflict'. Galloway threads these individual stories together, narratives crisscrossing: three weeks in the lives of individuals struggling to survive as their beloved city is besieged. The characters of Arrow and the cellist are based upon real people, but in his examination of their feelings and motives, Galloway makes them his own. They are worn out with war, fearful of what will become of them and their loved ones. Only the cellist and his music brings hope - hope that mankind is still capable of humanity, that the old world is not completely lost, that the war has not destroyed everything. Galloway's style is sparse, pared down; his prose has the deceptive simplicity of a short story. The work of an expert, The Cellist of Sarajevo is a controlled and subtle piece of craftsmanship."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
