The Somalian boy was rushed from All Saints Secondary School in the Barmulloch area of Glasgow to the city's Stobhill Hospital shortly after 11.30am. It is understood the boy was involved in a scuffle with another pupil before becoming ill, but Strathclyde Police could not confirm what happened to the boy and said inquiries were continuing. A police spokeswoman said: \"The 11-year-old boy was removed to hospital after apparently becoming ill following an incident at All Saints Secondary School. \"He was pronounced dead a short time after admittance. Police officers are continuing inquiries to establish the circumstances surrounding the boy's death. A report will be forwarded to the procurator fiscal.\" A post-mortem examination was due to be carried out later today to establish how the boy died. Glasgow City Council said the boy, a Somalian refugee who had lived in the city for three and a half years, collapsed in the school dining area during a mid-morning break between 11am and 12pm. Thomas McDonald, the headteacher at the 900-pupil Roman Catholic school, has written to all parents informing them of the tragedy. In his letter he says: \"I write to inform you of great sadness that due to a tragic event today in school a pupil has lost his life. The whole school community obviously feels a deep sense of grief and our thoughts are with his family. \"Pupils should attend school as normal tomorrow. Appropriate support will be available to all those who require it. Prayers will be offered for the repose of his soul.\" The council's education services convener Steven Purcell said: \"This is very tragic news. Our thoughts are with everyone connected with the school at this sad time, in particular of course with the family and friends of the pupil concerned.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
