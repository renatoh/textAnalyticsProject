A penalty from Shaun Maloney just past the half hour gave Rainer Bonhof's side a half-time lead, but two goals in the closing minutes handed victory to the visitors. The Scots had the best of a tepid first 45 minutes, eventually getting the breakthrough when John Kennedy was fouled in the box by Vilmos Vanczak and Maloney made no mistake from the spot. But with substitutes from both sides littering the second half - both sides using full complements - the game deteriorated. And with four minutes to go, Scotland paid the price for their insipid display when a Hungarian substitute, Tomas Csehi, scored from close range. Then, in stoppage time, another substitute Zoltan Jovanczi, hit the winner. It was a poor end to a poor game for the home side and the paltry 1,894 people who paid to watch. The Scots had six debutants in their starting line-up, and there was bound to be a certain uneasiness about the early stages. But their first chance came as early as the seventh minute, when Maloney almost capitalised on slackness from Istvan Rodenbucher inside the six-yard box, but the ball was cleared to safety. Garry O'Connor's turn and cross from the left to Brian Prunty should have resulted in a goal two minutes later, but the Aberdeen player's header from eight yards was well saved by the goalkeeper Marton Fulop. Moments later Maloney curled a 20-yard free-kick just past a post and in the 13th minute Simon Lappin lashed a 25-yard free-kick off the bar with Fulop struggling to reach, and the ball rebounded clear. Scotland continued to have the best of the play, with the Hungarians threatening little as they methodically made their way up the pitch. Bonhof made five changes at the interval and there was always a danger that any rhythm would be lost and sure enough, after the restart, the Hungarians were on an even keel and more progressive. There was some rough tackling from both sides and the game looked disjointed, especially from the Scots' point of view, with no real creativity or thought in their attacks. Neither goalkeeper was seeing much action and as the second half wore on, the quality of play deteriorated.
