Top stories An investigation into how some of the world\u2019s biggest businesses and global figures in politics, entertainment and sport have sheltered their wealth in secretive tax havens launches today. The Paradise Papers \u2013 based on millions of pages of documents \u2013 expose the global environments in which tax abuses can thrive and the complex and seemingly artificial ways the wealthiest corporations can legally protect their wealth. The material for the Paradise Papers has come from two offshore service providers and the company registries of 19 tax havens and was obtained by the German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung and shared by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists with partners including the Guardian. There is a video explainer here. Among the revelations: Millions of pounds from the Queen\u2019s private estate has been invested in a Cayman Islands fund \u2013 and some of her money went to a retailer accused of exploiting poor families and vulnerable people. Extensive offshore dealings by Donald Trump\u2019s cabinet members, advisers and donors, including substantial payments from a firm co-owned by Vladimir Putin\u2019s son-in-law to the shipping group of the US commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross. Twitter and Facebook received hundreds of millions of dollars in investments that can be traced back to Russian state financial institutions. The Australian arm of the global mining giant Glencore moved billions of dollars through Bermuda. At the centre of the leak is Appleby, a law firm with outposts in Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, the British Virgin Islands, the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey. Appleby says it has investigated all the allegations, and found \u201cthere is no evidence of any wrongdoing, either on the part of ourselves or our clients\u201d, adding: \u201cWe are a law firm which advises clients on legitimate and lawful ways to conduct their business. We do not tolerate illegal behaviour.\u201d The Australian Taxation Office says it is ready to use information from the Paradise Papers to launch new investigations into global tax avoidance. The tax office has been working for several months with partner agencies across the world in anticipation of the new data release by the ICIJ, it said on Monday. \u201cI am confident the ATO is in a position to respond decisively to this data release,\u201d said Mark Konza, the tax office\u2019s deputy commissioner, international. \u201cWe know and trust that most people do the right thing, and that many taxpayers identified as part of the leak will be meeting their Australian tax obligations. However, we investigate all leads and have the resources and expertise to take action against taxpayers or intermediaries found to be caught up in the illegal use of offshore structures or providers.\u201d Pauline Hanson gets on her \u201cbattler bus\u201d today on a slightly belated start to her electoral mission to conquer Queensland. One Nation is hitting the road to make up for time as a result of Hanson being overseas when the election was called, and will start in Brisbane before heading north along the coast. The electorate offensive will reach Townsville by the end of the week, before going on to far north Queensland at the weekend. The latest Galaxy poll, published yesterday, showed 54% of respondents were worried the state would go backwards under a government controlled by Hanson\u2019s party, an increase of 5% in less than a year. While the poll confirmed Labor voters were the most worried, it also revealed 61% of LNP voters were concerned about a One Nation-dominated future. There has been a 99% rise in notification rates of gonorrhoea infection in Australia\u2019s cities but an 8% drop in rural areas over the past five years, according to a new report on the nation\u2019s sexual health. Overall, notification rates have risen 63%. The annual surveillance report on HIV, viral hepatitis and sexually transmissible infections, which is released by the Kirby Institute in Sydney on Monday, shows there were 23,887 new diagnoses of gonorrhoea in 2016, with about three quarters of them in men. Men aged between 25 and 29 and women between 20 and 24 saw the largest increase in gonorrhoea infections. Labor is not letting go of the citizenship issue \u2013 it\u2019s calling for the Coalition to agree to universal disclosure in place of the audit others are demanding. Labor and the Greens plan on opening the week by prosecuting the government over its refusal to allow either a citizenship audit or disclosure plan despite lingering questions over MPs\u2019 eligibility. Alex Hawke and Josh Frydenberg were the latest Liberal MPs to be questioned about their citizenship status, something both strongly deny is in doubt. Late on Sunday Penny Wong called for Hawke and the Victorian Liberal Julia Banks \u2013who denies claims she has Greek citizenship by descent \u2013 to go the high court. \u201cAustralians can no longer believe [Malcolm]Turnbull or his MPs when they say trust us,\u201d Wong said. Sport The goals are flying in from every angle and Pep Guardiola\u2019s Manchester City are on course to smash just about every scoring record in history. Their latest victim, Arsenal, suffered a 3-1 defeat that means they have lost four of their first six away games. Manchester United, City\u2019s closest rivals, lost 1-0 at Chelsea courtesy of a \u00c1lvaro Morata header and are now eight points behind. The success of Dimitri Petratos in this season of the A-League is a case study for the future success of the competition, writes Jonathan Howcroft. He argues that players including Petratos, Daniel De Silva and Kearyn Baccus indicate that the competition must provide opportunities for local talent with high ceilings \u2013 particularly after failed experiments overseas. This should be prioritised over team success. Thinking time Matthew Abbott has covered sad stories around the world, from the Rohingya refugee crisis in Bangladesh to the South Sudan civil war, yet his work last year at Manus Island profoundly affected him. Here he writes about how in covering previous situations, there always seemed to be some kind of hope or will to fight. But on Manus, all that is left is a sense of despair. The common feeling among the men he meets is a desire to die. Miriam Lancewood has been living off grid, in the wild, for seven years now, a far cry from her previous life as a teacher in Australia. She can still pinpoint the exact moment she knew she had truly broken with social norms. \u201cIt was when the idea was born to wash my hair with urine,\u201d she recalls. Now she and husband, Peter, are walking across Europe to Turkey, with a tent and little else. The big question she keeps wondering about in the wild: where are all the women? And yes, it\u2019s Melbourne Cup week, when everyone goes over the top for a horse race and when the world\u2019s racing elite ply their annual quest, before going home wondering what the hell happened, again. It is a hangover from another era that gives annual licence to a national hangover, and no other national event can so conjure Australia\u2019s historic and reckless will to party. This year\u2019s Cup can boast a record-equalling 11 international runners, and Michael Hutak guides you through what to expect this year. What\u2019s he done now? The president will have plenty on his plate now so it\u2019s good that he got to relax with a round of golf with Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, and world No 4 Hideki Matsuyama. They didn\u2019t keep score and held up white baseball caps bearing the message \u201cDonald and Shinzo Make Alliance Even Greater\u201d. But his next two destinations \u2013 South Korea and China \u2013 are expected to pose bigger challenges on the two defining issues of the trip: North Korea and trade. Media roundup There is not much room left on the front page once various pictures of horses have been squeezed in alongside the offers of Melbourne Cup expertise and sweepstakes (looking at you, Herald Sun), but some did try. The Mercury carries the story of Jo Siejka \u2013 a first-time Labour candidate and the only woman in a field of seven \u2013 who has triumphed in the one-time Liberal heartland of Pembroke. She credited her success last night to her positive campaign. The win is a huge boost for Labour ahead of Tasmania\u2019s state election. \u201cPem-broken\u201d is the headline. The Fairfax papers look at the continuing citizenship rumblings, focusing on Alex Hawke and the Senate presidency. They also say Labor and the Liberals \u201chave undertaken sweeping behind the scenes audits of all their MPs\u201d despite being publicly opposed to the idea. And the Daily Telegraph targets housing affordability, saying red tape is preventing developers building on land that has already been released for residential development. In the past five years, just 115,000 houses were built despite enough land being released to take 805,000 new dwellings, it reports. Coming up The Australian Electoral Commission will hold a special count today to determine who will replace the disqualified senators Fiona Nash, Larissa Waters, Scott Ludlam and Malcolm Roberts. The UN climate change conference kicks off tonight in Bonn, Germany. It will run for 11 days, during which you can find all our COP23 coverage here.
