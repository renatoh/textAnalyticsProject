Founder Simon Murie will run the first of four Turkish tours scheduled for this summer from 24 to 30 May. The tour follows in the wake of Lord Byron with a crossing of the 1,300-metre wide Hellespont, and swims from the beaches of Gallipoli and the ancient city of Troy. Other tours include the Scilly Isles; carving past the Corryvreckan whirlpool made famous by George Orwell in the Inner Hebrides; and a weekend taster across the Lake Dis trict. Murie, who will be taking the tours himself, said: 'When I got into open-water swimming myself, I looked for a company selling holidays that catered for it. There weren't any so I decided to set one up.' The tours are suitable for anyone who can swim the average daily distance of the tour, typically two miles (or 40 lengths of a pool) at a regular pace. Freestylers, breaststrokers, backstrokers and butterfliers are all welcome. Murie will teach the idiosyncrasies of outdoor swimming, mainly in increasing the efficiency of your stroke. But he adds: The emphasis of each tour is to make it a holiday and not an endurance event.' Typically, swimming will take up two hours of a day, and the rest will be spent walking, eating and drinking. All groups swim with a canoe or motorised escort, and in colder waters wetsuits are optional. Murie says: 'Nothing beats swimming outdoors.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
