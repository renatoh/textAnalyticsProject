It is clear that, at the time of its inception, the current model for the NHS contained a number of fundamental flaws which doomed it to ultimate failure: \u00b7It was designed to be controlled from Whitehall, an approach now totally discredited; \u00b7The monolithic structure was inefficient and hugely wasteful; \u00b7Politicians, not clinicians, dictated decisions on the nature of care so the NHS responded too often to political rather than patients' individual needs; \u00b7Bureaucrats and obsession with artificial targets ensured that authority was concentrated at the centre; \u00b7The patient had virtually no choice over where or how to be treated;and \u00b7There was no incentive or mechanism for raising the quality, or extending the availability, of care. For over 50 years, the NHS has struggled through, sustained by a combination of its hugely dedicated staff, a collective national will to fulfill its original goal - high quality care for all, free at the point of use and irrespective of ability to pay - and increasingly large injections of taxpayers' money. Labour's approach has confirmed that these factors are no longer sufficient to paper over the cracks. They have taxed more and spent more, but failed to produce clear improvements. It is now obvious that, however much money is thrown at the current system, it will never produce the quality of healthcare many of our European neighbours take for granted. Unless there is fundamental and radical reform, the NHS will never produce the quality of care we have a right to expect. And the people who would suffer most as a result would be the very people who rely most on the NHS. Labour's internal divisions mean it is unable to deliver the reform that many recognise to be necessary. Only a Conservative Government will be able to deliver this. We will reform and improve the NHS, making it fit for the 21st century, and able to give the British people the healthcare we deserve. Our NHS will offer high quality care, free at the point of use and irrespective of the ability to pay. It will draw on what we have seen during our extensive travels - healthcare systems which share our ideals, but offer a considerably higher standard of care and much better clinical outcomes than the NHS. Over the past two years we have looked extensively and in detail at the healthcare provision in a number of countries. We have visited Australia, Germany, Sweden, New Zealand, France, Ireland, Denmark, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Spain, Turkey and Finland. In our earlier pamphlet Alternative Prescriptions we discussed in detail the lessons we have learned from individual systems. There are clear lessons to be learned from the general approach taken by many of these countries. Our experiences convinced us that we must undertake far-reaching reform on three broad fronts: \u00b7taking politicians out of running the NHS; \u00b7giving real freedom to health professionals; and \u00b7ensuring patients have real choice in health. The Conservative Party already has a very clear vision of the overall structure of the NHS which will result from our reforms. This series of Consultation Papers, addressing the themes listed above, therefore sets out the broad nature of the changes we propose, and seeks the views of those involved in the provision and organisation of healthcare on precisely what form those changes should take. I very much hope that you will let me know your views on any or all of what we are proposing. Please send them (marked Consultation Documents) to me either by post, to Dr Liam Fox, House of Commons, London SW1A 0AA or by e-mail to clareb@parliament.uk. The consultation period will close on 1 July. Dr Liam Fox MP Shadow Secretary of State for Health March 2003 1.Dismantling the Target Culture The aim of this Paper is to explain how we will take politicians out of the day to day running of the NHS, allowing them instead to focus on a regulatory role, combined with involvement in wider aspects of the health debate, including a new framework for public health. The Conservative Party's model for the fundamental reform of the NHS starts from the premise that politicians should have a much smaller role in the organisation and provision of healthcare. At the very inception of the current model of the NHS in 1948, its Labour Party masters deliberately built in mechanisms to ensure that Ministers and Whitehall bureaucrats would control all the key levers of power. Bevan's remark that he wished to hear the rattle of every bedpan in the NHS from his desk in Westminster was indicative of the collectivist mindset of the day, and set the tone of the political direction for the NHS. The precise extent of political interference in decisions concerning which patients should be treated, and when, has fluctuated over the succeeding half century. But throughout that period, there has never been any doubt that politicians - of all colours - have considered it entirely acceptable for them to interfere in and to manage the running of the NHS. The result is that there has been no effective differentiation between targets, performance indicators and information needed for doctors, managers and patients to make meaningful or informed decisions. The emphasis on measuring throughput and input, while largely ignoring outcome, the most important measure, has increasingly resulted in a \"never mind the quality feel the width\" NHS. It has also led to confusion over the terms used. \"Targets\" which bring financial reward if achieved are in reality instruments of central control, not aspirational goals. They oblige managers and clinicians to respond to Ministerial command and control, rather than use their own skills and expertise to solve problems in their locality. Managers are not allowed the freedom to manage, with the perverse outcome that the NHS is under-managed on the frontline, but over-bureaucratised at the centre. Clinical staff have increasingly been faced with an unpalatable and unethical distortion of clinical priorities, as a result of which sicker patients may have to wait longer while less serious elective cases are treated more quickly to satisfy statistical targets. A recent BMA report stated that \"70% of consultants report that Government targets or managerial directives are distorting clinical priorities\". Similarly, the recent Audit Commission report, 'Waiting List Accuracy', stated that \"a number of trusts were found to be operating in ways that seem weighted away from the interests of patients\". This is the direct result of Labour's current Ministerial practice. There is widespread reporting of a culture of fear and intimidation throughout the NHS with staff afraid to speak up for the interests of their patients for fear of disciplinary action. Managers, clinicians and patients are all victims of this corrosive culture. Commenting on the manipulation of waiting list figures the Audit Commission concluded that \"there needs to be an open debate within the NHS about what has led to this behaviour\". Such an open debate is impossible under Labour's current micromanagement and bullying approach to the NHS. 2.Measuring What Matters When considering their role in health provision, politicians need to distinguish between the broad debate about wider health issues and the running of the NHS as an administrative unit. The British public is fed up with the NHS being used as a political football. The Conservative Party intends to take politicians out of the day to day running of the NHS, leaving them with responsibility for the quality agenda, the regulatory framework and wider issues of public health. However, such a depoliticisation of health can occur only when direct control over the NHS is removed from politicians, and when the levers that they have traditionally used to exert such control have also been removed. That is why the Conservatives are committed to the abolition of the central administrative targets that tie the NHS in red tape and a substantial reduction in the bureaucratic structure currently needed to implement them. We will move to a new, more flexible system of quality and effectiveness measurements under the reformed Commission for Health Improvement. Rather than rigid targets with financial flows dependent on their achievement, we will work to establish better measures of clinical effectiveness. There needs to be a spectrum ranging from minimum acceptable practice to maximum achievable practice against which providers can be assessed. This assessment will need to take account of geography, demographics and the history of the providers concerned. Rather than being subject to Labour's one size fits all targets, healthcare providers should be able to explain their performance in different clinical areas and their investment decisions against the background of their own local circumstances. Without this, the foundation hospitals discussed later in this consultation document will not enjoy genuine freedom of action. It is also necessary to understand that not all aspects of healthcare can be measured numerically. We have been very impressed by arguments put forward by the Royal College of Nursing that a number of important elements of care require a different form of assessment and interpretation. For example, the number of falls, infections or bedsores that an elderly patient may have during a hospital stay are a vital part of measuring the quality of care, but they are not picked up by statistical targets, which tend to measure length of stay or delayed discharge. We are also concerned that the target culture discriminates against specific patient groups. For example, because the Government tends to be highly focused on an adult-centred agenda, too often the needs of children are not dealt with in a sufficiently sensitive or specific way. The Government's insistence that the work of healthcare professionals must be geared above all to the fulfillment of its targets has also produced rampant target-oriented behaviour. Labour's enforcement of this mindset distorts doctors' and nurses' clinical decisions in a most unethical way, and utterly undermines managers' budgetary and administrative strategies. The consequence of Labour's target-obsessed approach to the NHS over the last six years is that the dominant question is no longer \"Does the care fit the patient's needs?\" but \"Does the care fit the NHS Plan?\" Putting Quality of Care First Dismantling the target culture will also allow us to reduce the number of those involved in the bureaucracy of the Department of Health. We can thus not only give greater professional freedom to front line staff but also direct resources in a way that will be of direct benefit to patient care. We have begun examining the employment patterns in the NHS both centrally and peripherally with a view to reducing posts that cannot be shown to benefit patient care. While we value highly the hard work and dedication of NHS staff, we must at all times remember that it is a service whose primary concern should be the provision of high quality care to its patients. Our proposals for taking the politicians out of service delivery, giving greater freedoms to front line staff and offering more choice to patients will enable us to concentrate properly on a quality agenda. Our key objective in doing so will be to ensure that future funding allocations are rational, reflecting clinical considerations. In order to do so, we will need to develop a more standardised methodology of determining clinical outcomes. The NHS needs far-reaching reform. The Conservative Party will have the courage to carry it through. 3.Setting Doctors, Nurses and Managers Free We need to return to doctors, nurses and managers the authority to carry out their work in the way that they judge most appropriate. It is unacceptable for professional clinical staff to have to work to achieve objectives set for them by a central bureaucracy which are not defined in terms of the quality of treatment given to patients. Throughout the lifetime of the NHS, but especially over the last 10 - 15 years, there has been a growing trend to define its success in terms of the amount of money spent on the service, the number of patients treated and the number waiting for treatment at any given time, rather than the outcome of the treatment undertaken. Activity has mattered much more than effectiveness. The result is that many aspects of UK healthcare lag behind those of comparable countries. As we have examined the systems and outcomes of other countries we have become convinced that political interference in the workings of healthcare professionals is counterproductive in terms of both the workings of the system and the outcomes which it achieves. The best decisions for individual patients are made when there is greatest specificity and sensitivity in the data used. This means that such decisions need to be made as close as possible to the patient. It makes no sense whatsoever for politicians and their bureaucracy to attempt to second guess professionals who have expertise and training. New Labour's obsessive target culture has interfered with professional freedom, whether managerial or clinical, as never before and has resulted in both widespread clinical distortion and declining professional morale. Our aim is to give doctors, nurses and managers the autonomy they need. This Paper has already outlined how we mean to dismantle the target culture and remove the burden of bureaucracy. We will build on this by giving general practice and hospitals the freedom to decide for themselves how to run their affairs. We will do so by extending Foundation status to all Acute Trusts and examining how new freedoms can be exercised at General Practice level. The freedom which such organisations will enjoy under our proposals will be determined by the results we want to achieve, not by the political expediency and compromise which seem increasingly to dominate the thinking of New Labour's policy. It is entirely conceivable that Labour will make the correct analysis of the problems and identify the necessary remedies, but then be unable to implement them for political reasons, thus delaying vital reforms yet again. Labour's current approach of \"earned autonomy\" - itself an oxymoron meaning \"you can do what you want as long as it is what the Government wants\" - will be replaced by a decentralised NHS, in which local needs are better reflected in provision, and in which the patient, not the system, comes first. We are not afraid of diversity. From diversity comes innovation, and from innovation comes excellence and advance. 4.Primary Care One of the striking aspects of our visits to examine the healthcare systems of other countries was the widely expressed view that, where it works well, general practice is the jewel in the crown of the UK healthcare system. There is little doubt that patients here not only continue to value highly their relationship with their GP, but would also like to be able to obtain as much treatment as they can at their local surgery, since hospitals are invariably further away, with appointments harder to come by. We want to build on these strengths, in order to ensure that primary care is at the heart of our proposals. In particular, we will ensure that primary care staff are used more appropriately, and their skills properly deployed, so that the acute sector is used only for patients who cannot receive the appropriate level of care in a primary care setting. The primary care sector has been in a state of turmoil for the best part of 15 years, as successive Governments have introduced structural reforms. GPs, their staff and their patients have not known whether they are at the end of one period of reform or the beginning of another. Primary care does not need further major structural reform. We will therefore work within the current framework. The key building-block in the primary care structure will remain the PCT. However, a number of functional changes will be needed. In bolstering the role of general practice, we will apply the lessons which were learned at the time of the implementation of fund-holding. The abolition of fund holding was one of the most regressive steps taken by New Labour. Under fund-holding, GPs enjoyed greater freedom to make decisions about where to refer patients and greater flexibility to develop innovative approaches to care. However, some felt that there was a conflict of interest between patient referral and direct budget holding. Rather, the lack of IT meant that patients often followed pre-existing contracts, rather than money following the patients. We will ensure a clear definition of the respective roles in primary care, and an equally clear distinction between primary care and the acute sector. \u00b7 PCTs will be the commissioners of primary care. \u00b7PCTs will fund the Acute Trusts according to activity levels and based on a national tariff system. \u00b7Commissioning of elective care will be carried out at general practice level on an individual patient basis. This will mainly be done by GPs, but could equally be the responsibility of practice nurses where clinical management has been devolved in defined areas. The PCT will act as the fund holder in this instance. \u00b7PCTs will, in general, not be allowed to act as a provider of services. The aim of these proposals is to clarify the respective roles in primary care, match funding more closely to activity and ensure that clinical decisions about treatment and referral are taken as close to individual patients as possible. Medical staff will be able to carry out their proper role as objective professional advocates for their patients, with patients empowered to make the ultimate decision about their referral to the secondary care sector in line with their own personal circumstances. We intend to reverse the position where patients are too often regarded as being there to service the system. The system must serve the patients. 5.Foundation Hospitals Foundation Hospitals are not an end in themselves. They are among a number of building blocks we will use to create a more diverse provision of healthcare, increasingly independent of state control. Other mechanisms will be discussed in our next Consultation Paper. Where Labour breaks new ground in this area, they will receive our support, so long as they move in our preferred direction of greater pluralism and the dismantling of Bevan's monolithic model for the NHS. It is difficult at present to know exactly what model of care an incoming Conservative Government would inherit. We have tabled more than 60 Parliamentary Questions seeking clarification of the Government's intentions on Foundation Hospitals (a flavour of which is given in a separate annex) but we await the details of Labour's proposed legislation before we can have a clear idea of their specific plans. NHS hospitals will continue to be the main source of secondary care, especially emergency care. However, in order to be able to tailor the services they provide to the needs of their patients, it is important that those hospitals should enjoy the greatest possible freedom to run their own affairs. We will confer Foundation Status on all acute NHS trusts. They will become not-for-profit organisations, free to manage themselves. We will allow all Foundation Hospitals to set their own pay and conditions, in order that they can recruit and retain the staff they need to carry out their work. Local management needs to be free to reflect local employment conditions if we are ever to be able to deal with the acute shortages of staff that can afflict specific geographical areas. Foundation Hospitals will also be able to borrow money to enable them to invest in the services that are required in their locality. We will examine all ways to make this possible, including the possibility of issuing of community hospital bonds. If borrowing is to occur outside Treasury limits, Foundation Trusts will have to be subject to proper financial disciplines. This will require proper transparency and scrutiny in their accounting procedures, with an ability to determine at an early stage if their financial stability or viability is at risk. It will be necessary to create a framework so that, in extreme cases, it is possible to place a failing Trust under special procedures, seeking new management to ensure continued clinical provision. This framework will require management to shoulder increased legal responsibility for their financial management, in line with normal practice for independent organisations. We intend that the bulk of funding for acute Trusts will come via PCTs. This will be either reimbursement for services undertaken based on an agreed national tariff system, or payment for referrals made directly from practice level. A system based on this model will fulfil the two requirements that that we found to be central to the efficient running of devolved models in other health systems overseas, namely knowing how much everything costs and paying on the basis of real activity levels. Ensuring that elective activity is based on individual referrals, with money following the patient, is the best way of ensuring accountability at the level of individual patients. We are confident that the IT currently being developed within the NHS would make this system easily achievable. We anticipate that there will probably be a need to have a second smaller funding stream to finance specialist hospitals and projects. While the direction of our policy is clear, we are anxious to consult in detail about the practical implications of these ideas. All too often those who work in and are served by the NHS are used as guinea-pigs for policies about which they have not been consulted. We want to take advantage of the huge amount of practical experience available in producing a coherent and practical way forward for our healthcare in the UK and will use the advice we receive in the coming months to produce a workable NHS, fit for the 21st century and capable of giving us the health we deserve."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
