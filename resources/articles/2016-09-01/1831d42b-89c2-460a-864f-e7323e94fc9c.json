It was one of the rawest press conferences that anyone will ever attend. It was also one of the most enriching. That was how Vervoort, who wanted to set the record straight following reports that she was planning to kill herself after the Paralympics, wanted it. The Belgian wheelchair athlete showed her captive audience her silver medal from Saturday\u2019s T52 400m and revealed the motto that keeps her going. \u201cBelieve you can!\u201d she shouted. \u201cYes, you can!\u201d Vervoort\u2019s race on Saturday was dominated by the chilling possibility that she might be gone for ever in a fortnight. However, while the 37-year-old signed euthanasia papers in 2008 because of the relentless pain of living with an incurable and degenerative spinal condition, she has no plans to say goodbye yet. She wants to educate the world about euthanasia, which is legal in Belgium. \u201cIt is really difficult to get those papers,\u201d Vervoort said. \u201cYou have to see different doctors for them to see that you have a progressive disease or a mental disease. You need three different signatures from doctors and to talk with a psychiatrist to see if it is really what you want.\u201d Vervoort, who was 15 when she was diagnosed with a rare progressive muscle condition that resulted in paraplegia, will have to seek further approval from doctors when she decides that the pain is too much. She explained that her papers gave her hope and control. \u201cI am more busy with Buddhism and feeling Zen,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I didn\u2019t have those papers, I would have committed suicide. I hope other countries like Brazil can talk about it. It makes people live longer. It doesn\u2019t mean that when people sign the papers, they have to die two weeks later. I signed my papers in 2008. Look now, 2016 and I won the silver medal.\u201d Vervoort, who kept smiling, disagreed with the suggestion that assisted dying was dangerous for disabled people. \u201cI have a progressive disease,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery year, it is worse. Every time, I give things away. If you see me years ago, I could draw beautiful art. Now it is impossible. I see 20%. What\u2019s the next thing coming? I am really scared.\u201d There are times when she cannot eat because of her suffering. The cold winters in Belgium are bad for Vervoort. She loves training in the warmth of Lanzarote and wants to stay there. \u201cThere was a woman who was used to staying with palliative patients,\u201d she said. \u201cShe lost consciousness because she couldn\u2019t watch me suffering. I feel good now. In half an hour, it can be that I am suffering a lot.\u201d Vervoort has a bucket list. She wants to go skydiving, fly in an F16 jet, open a museum and compete in a rally race. \u201cNow my fear of death is gone,\u201d she said. \u201cAssisted death is something like they operate on you, you go to sleep and never wake. It feels like it will be peaceful. I don\u2019t want to suffer when I die.\u201d This is Vervoort\u2019s final Paralympics. She cried during the opening ceremony and said that she would push her arms out of her body when she defended her T52 100m title this Saturday. \u201cMoney means nothing to me,\u201d Vervoort said. \u201cBut I am a rich person. I want people to remember me as the lady who is also laughing. And when I am suffering, that I am still looking at the good things.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
