Far-off chanting and beats like war drums fill the morning air, carried over despite the rain, from Yokohama\u2019s Nissan Stadium \u2013 almost a kilometre away. Kick-off is not for two and a half hours. Approaching the stadium, it feels more carnival than football match. Who can blame them for starting the celebrations early? Yokohama\u2019s second-half demolition of prefectural rivals Kawasaki last week ensured total control of the title race heading into the final day of the season. Needing only to avoid defeat by four goals or more against Tokyo FC, the Tricolore essentially had one hand on the trophy. Nissan Stadium is built for the big occasion. It is here where Cafu lifted the World Cup trophy in 2002 after Ronaldo, El Fenomeno, put two past Oliver Kahn\u2019s Germany. It is here where Siya Kolisi lifted the Rugby World Cup trophy after the Springboks\u2019 triumph over England. It is here that Ange Postecoglou completed the fairytale. From just narrowly avoiding a relegation play-off due to goal difference last season, to J-League champions. The turnaround has been nothing short of remarkable, the likes of which never before seen in such a short amount of time in Japan\u2019s top flight. And they did it in style. Postecoglou introduced a new brand of attacking, ambitious football to a notoriously conservative league, and captured the hearts and respect of Japanese football pundits and fans along the way \u2013 particularly the Yokohama supporters who now sing his name in the stands. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful. So wonderful,\u201d says 34-year-old Yuki, holding the hand of his three-year-old son decked out in full Yokohama tracksuit. \u201cAt the start, we were not sure. The fans and the media thought \u2018who is this guy\u2019 \u2013 but the players trusted him. So we did.\u201d Another fan, 22-year-old Takuya, echoes these initial trepidations. \u201cLast year, we had very bad defence. One guy scored on us from halfway! A halfway goal \u2013 I think no no, he [Ange] makes the goalkeeper play too far forward. I think, what is he doing?\u201d This halfway goal, scored by Taishi Taguchi during Jubilo Iwata\u2019s 3-1 victory over Marinos last year, was an almost replica of the halfway goal conceded by Postecoglou\u2019s Socceroos in a 2-1 defeat to Greece back in 2016. Both goals drew similar criticism by Australian and Japanese media alike, who accused Postecoglou of pushing his keepers too far forward. But Postecoglou, just like after that Greece game, stood by his keeper, and stood by his high-risk, high-reward philosophy. Statistically, it\u2019s better to play with what is effectively an extra player operating as a sweeper when in possession, than to have him near the goal and out of the action for the bulk of the 90 minutes. Yokohama, to their credit, kept faith in Postecoglou, who has shown in the past that, when given the time to prioritise sustained development over immediate results, can produce magic. Think 2011-12 Brisbane Roar, who under Postecoglou went on a scintillating 36-game undefeated streak, the longest in top-level Australian sport, earning them the moniker \u201cRoarcelona\u201d. \u201cI enjoy those bits\u201d said Postecoglou at the post-game press conference, addressing the criticism shown by Japanese media when results weren\u2019t going his way. \u201cI enjoy the bits when maybe there is a little bit of doubt and people do question the way I do things. \u201cWhen you go to the movies, you don\u2019t mind a thriller as long as it\u2019s a happy ending. I think all the times I\u2019ve coached, especially at club level, it\u2019s always a happy ending. And I think people have seen that. \u201cThe club\u2019s been very supportive \u2013 the supporters have been very supportive, even last year when things weren\u2019t going well, and the players responded to every challenge I made. I\u2019ve never worried if things don\u2019t go well momentarily, because as I said, I know how it will end. It\u2019s always ended this way.\u201d In a piece published on Players Voice last year, Postecoglou wrote of three words that have shaped his football philosophy from the very beginning. Three words that a young Postecoglou would hear his late father yell at the television screen as he watched grown men on the other side of the planet kick a ball around in the early hours of the morning. \u201c\u039a\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9 \u03b7 \u03bc\u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u201d \u2013 roughly translated from Greek, it means keep the ball down; an ethos that was on full display for all to see as a sea of red, white and blue drummed, clapped, and chanted for the full 90, unwavering despite the chilly conditions. Fast, ferocious, attacking football. Courage, speed, don\u2019t think twice. Ball to feet. Play out from the back. Push. Push. Get the ball moving. Attack. This is Postecoglou\u2019s football. Get the ball back in play as soon as possible, pressure them, don\u2019t hold up. Look for openings, quick play, ball to feet \u2013 keep the ball on the ground. Later in the press conference, Postecoglou spoke of his controversial approach to the game. \u201cThe players have never been in any doubt that we would continue to play this football irrespective of what challenges are before us. Whether we\u2019re playing at home or away, whether we\u2019re first on the ladder or chasing \u2026 we\u2019ll keep playing this football. \u201cEvery day, we live and breathe this football. So that in situations like today, the players know no other way. They\u2019re not going to be affected by pressure, they\u2019re not going to be affected by conceding a goal or a red card. They only know one way, and that\u2019s what they\u2019ll do.\u201d Postecoglou\u2019s J-League triumph is one for the artists, the puritans, the lovers of the game. And he did it his way."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
