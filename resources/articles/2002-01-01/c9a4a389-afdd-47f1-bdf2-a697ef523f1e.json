We'd like to make an important point about the Elgin Marbles before we proceed. They are not marbles. The Elgin, or Parthenon Marbles, depending whose side of the argument you are on, are a collection of sculptures which formed a frieze that once decorated the sides of the Parthenon building in Athens. 2. Today, British MPs and actors are launching Parthenon 2004, a new campaign for the return of the marbles to Greece in time for the summer Olympics in Athens. 3. Which seems fair enough, but life and art are rarely that straightforward. The ownership of the Elgin marbles have been in dispute for 200 years, after the British Ambassador to Greece and Scottish peer Lord Elgin removed them from the Acropolis in 1801 and brought them to Britain. 4. Meanwhile Lord Byron, the promiscuous poet, philosopher, revolutionary and athlete was busy writing The Curse of Minerva, an unfeasibly long polemic of rage against Lord Elgin's looting of the marble scupltures. Byron said: \"So let him stand through ages yet unborn, fix'd statue on the pedestal of scorn.\" 5. And there was trouble with Lady Elgin, whose notorious affair with another Scotsman, Robert Fergusson, led to divorce trial revelations which confirmed the affair as the most lurid sex scandal of the early 19th century. Lord Elgin sued Ferguson for the breakdown of his marriage and won \u00a310,000. 6. There's more. In 1860, a passenger steamship named after Lady Elgin was rammed by a schooner, and sank in Lake Michigan with the loss of nearly 300 lives. Spooky. 7. Campaigners who want to keep the marbles in the British Museum argue that they have been saved from damage or destruction from the toxic pollution that has plagued Athens in the past decades. But successive polls show most Brits overwhelmingly support the return of the fifth century sculptures. 8. As does Hillary Clinton. But museum directors say that returning the marbles could set a precedent that may lead to the stripping of virtually every museum in the country. 9. Oh, the difficulty of this dilemma. Perhaps we should instead soothe ourselves with Keats' ode to the marbles, or try our hands at the Elgin reel, a Scottish dance named after you know who. 10. Either way, it's time to face facts: Britain could be losing its marbles."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
