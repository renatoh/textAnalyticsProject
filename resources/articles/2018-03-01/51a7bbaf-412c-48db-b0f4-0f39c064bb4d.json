Liverpool head to Old Trafford on Saturday two points behind their fierce rivals but minus the criticism that United\u2019s performances under Mourinho have generated. Klopp has defended his opposite number\u2019s pragmatism and admitted his Anfield reign would be viewed in a better light if, like the United manager, he had won the League Cup and Europa League in his first season. He believes leading clubs cannot complain about style when the philosophy of their managers is well established. Asked whether managers who could afford the best players had a responsibility to entertain as well as win, Klopp replied: \u201cThat\u2019s obviously not my question to answer. All the clubs in England who signed a foreign manager knew what they would get. Liverpool needed somebody to start the development with a big thirst for being immediately successful, which is quite difficult. \u201cThat didn\u2019t happen but everyone can see the way is positive at least. If you win the title next year then everyone will know it was a good signing. \u201cIf you want the most fluent offensive football and to be successful, then I think Pep Guardiola is a good choice. Antonio Conte\u2019s doing a fantastic job. We couldn\u2019t do any different here, not because we don\u2019t want but because nobody would accept it. If Liverpool won the league, then after the season no one would ask how it happened, nobody. \u201cWith this way there are no guarantees we will get there but we have to convince the people first with our style of football and being successful in the same way. We cannot play very defensive and not be successful; it just doesn\u2019t work. We have so many fans all over the world who watch us. They have to get something if they don\u2019t get silverware at the end of the season. We know the pressure here is to win \u2013 win the next game and then the next stage to win a cup or any other silverware. That was a long answer for something I didn\u2019t want to answer!\u201d Since October\u2019s dour goalless draw against Mourinho\u2019s team Liverpool have joined United in spending big on one player with the \u00a375m purchase of Virgil van Dijk. Their manager said Liverpool\u2019s owners, Fenway Sports Group, will continue to recruit expensively this summer but only on the right player. Klopp said: \u201cThis club will do what we have to do, the owners are ready for that. That was the sign for it but it doesn\u2019t mean we only spend in this category. When the player is the right player it is not important how expensive he was. He needs to fit in the team, that\u2019s why we paid the price. If the player is the right player, this club will pay big money.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
