Iran", "bodyText": "On a brisk spring morning four years and 11 months ago, a truck driver on the Iraqi-Turkish border killed time in a queue at customs by telling a Western reporter of the terrible consequences of the fall of Baghdad a month earlier. At the time, his doom-laden predictions of civil war and regional chaos seemed far-fetched. Now they seem far less so. From the distant, tsunami-struck tip of Sumatra to Wall Street, from the specialist world of counter-terrorism to that of contemporary feminist literary criticism, the war, the occupation and the continuing conflict in Iraq have left their mark. The effects will not be known for some time, but some broad effects are already all too evident. The Iraq of the Nineties - run by a nationalist, broadly secular Sunni Muslim elite; brutalised and terrorised, but stable under Saddam Hussein - has been replaced by a weak, violent, unstable state racked by a largely communitarian civil war and crime. Where once the fear in Ankara, Riyadh, Tehran or Tel Aviv was of an unpredictable dictator, now it is of a spillover of chaos. Though we should be mindful always that the events of 2003-2008 in Iraq were not inscribed on a blank slate but in a region rich in historical events, processes and actors, clearly the war has wrought radical change in its own right as well as accelerating or exposing ongoing evolution. Watching the American tanks lined up on the embankments of the Tigris in Baghdad in the spring of 2003 was, for me at least, a shock. The incongruity of these men and machines in the streets where, a year earlier, visiting reporters had sat to eat grilled fish at outdoor restaurants with their Ministry of Information minders was stunning. From being a distant superpower, whose interest in the Middle East was always intermittent, the US is now implanted in the region. 'America has become a neighbour, not a superpower,' said Shmuel Bar of the Multidisciplinary Research Centre in Israel. There is little chance, whatever presidential candidates pledge, of American disengagement in the near future. The war has brought about a major shift in the local balance of power - though not the one the White House planned. The biggest regional winner in the conflict appears to be Iran. Tehran's major historical rival has been profoundly weakened, and there is a leadership vacuum in the Islamic world, in no small part due to the loss of credibility with 'the street' of rulers such as King Abdullah of Jordan or the House of al-Saud. Iran has been assuming, as it did after the Islamic revolution of 1979, the role of spearhead state leading the Muslim masses against those international enemies who oppose their interests. Iran's position is also bolstered by the democracy and demography in Iraq. Though their national identity remains strong, Iraq's Shia majority have closer cultural, social, religious and commercial links with Iran than with the minority Sunni. Given their numbers and thus their dominance of any conceivable democratic system in their homeland, it is difficult to see how the Iraqi Sunnis can seriously threaten their Shia compatriots' power. The result: though fears of a regional Shia alliance of Lebanese Hizbollah (backed by Iran), Shia Iraqis and Shia hardliners in Tehran may be exaggerated, the Shia-Sunni tensions that rack the region are, if not unprecedented, then certainly impressive in their intensity. They are a consequence of the war. The fact that a Shia community is running an Arab country for the first time cannot but profoundly change the balance of power in the region. If things were going better for America in Iraq, the new strength of Iran would matter less. However, the quagmire in which 140,000 American troops have become mired means that few can now be expected to follow Libya's Colonel Gadaffi and renounce opposition to 'the West' through fear of US-led retribution. This has led to a paradoxical position. Now they have broken the taboo that for decades meant that marching on capitals to overturn regimes was unacceptable, the Americans cannot now exploit their new theoretical freedom to act. 'The most dangerous consequence of the war in Iraq is that it has destroyed America's ability to intervene where necessary,' said Yahia Saeed of the London School of Economics. 'It has shown the US to be vulnerable and incapable in many ways.' The hardline Iranian leadership is therefore confident enough to ignore American sabre-rattling and continue with its controversial nuclear programme. This, in turn, according to Shmuel Bar, could mean the end of the control of nuclear proliferation, leading to a 'poly-nuclear' Middle East, with consequences for states like North Korea. The American ability to intervene has suffered for other reasons too, perhaps harder to remedy than military weakness. 'The war in Iraq has led to the loss of the moral authority of the West. No one takes the UK and the US seriously any more,' said Professor Ali Ansari of St Andrews University in Scotland. 'Playing fast and loose with international law means it is now very difficult to invoke the same body of law when we need to.' Certainly the credibility of the involvement of such figures as Condoleezza Rice, the US Secretary of State, in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations is now shaky, and the continuing existence of Guant\u00e1namo Bay and the scandal at Abu Ghraib prison has also undermined any criticism of human rights abuses anywhere else. The Bush administration's abandonment of its previously vociferous, if unconvincing, advocacy of democratic reform in the Islamic world is one indirect result. Another consequence of the various failures of the Iraq war has been to discredit the post-Cold War doctrines of intervention formulated and tested in the Nineties. From early disasters such as that of Somalia in 1993, through to more successful operations in Sierra Leone, Kosovo and Afghanistan, a range of new foreign policy options were tried out. Iraq was their apogee and their grave. One reason is the huge impact the war has had on public opinion in the countries from which the troops and the cash for such operations have to come. For Afghanistan, this indirect effect of the war in Iraq has had devastating consequences. The country was already struggling to keep global attention only a few months after the blitzkrieg that removed the Taliban and evicted Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda from its training camps was over. Not only were crucial military resources being diverted to Iraq by the autumn of 2002, but political attention thinned out too. The lack of serious reconstruction or military effort was obvious to anyone travelling through south-east Afghanistan even in late 2004. Thousands of square miles of strategically crucial territory had been left to rot. Villagers in the back country around Kandahar saw no benefit from the invasion, merely growing insecurity. No one should have been surprised in 2006 to find that, while the world had been looking away, the Taliban had quietly returned to their old haunts. In addition, the marketing of the Iraq war means that Western governments are having a hard time selling another unpopular war to domestic populations sceptical after swallowing the various empty claims about weapons of mass destruction. And what of the global battle for hearts and minds, the struggle that is now widely agreed to be the 'strategic centre of gravity' of what was once known as the 'war on terror' but, in Britain at least, has been relabelled in less inflammatory language? Few now try, as British ministers once did, to argue that the invasion of Iraq and the continuing threat from modern radical Islamic militancy are not related. Interview Muslim militants anywhere in the world and they will tell you how the West is set on the division, humiliation and subordination of the Ummah, the world's Muslim community. That the invasion of Iraq has reinforced this 'single narrative' is now taken as a given by intelligence services in the UK, the US and elsewhere. Their analytic efforts are now directed at understanding why certain individuals are vulnerable to that ideology, not whether the invasion of Iraq has boosted militants' propaganda. One question worrying Western intelligence services is why the 'blowback' that was so feared - the hundreds or even thousands of hardened 'Iraqi veterans' who would return to Europe or elsewhere to sow terror - has not yet occurred. This is 'the dog that so far has not barked,' according to one intelligence official. It may just be a question of time. The dog has very definitely barked in Lebanon, where a militant Sunni group fought a small war against local forces last year, and in Algeria, where Iraq veterans have spearheaded a fusion between local militants and the 'al-Qaeda central' high command based in the tribal areas of Pakistan. Yet al-Qaeda itself has struggled with Iraq, never succeeding in imposing itself on a complex, evolving insurgency. Bin Laden's attempt to appropriate the Iraqi 'jihad' has failed. Instead, the excesses of psychopathic commanders like Abu Musab al-Zarqawi have revolted many potential militant supporters inside and outside the country, and a fierce row has now broken out among jihadi ideologues in the Middle East about the viability and desirability of violent strategies. Indeed, it is noticeable that the closer you get to the experience of terrorist violence - dismembered babies, bereaved mothers, incinerated corpses of policemen - the lower the support for the militants is among the general population. It is in Morocco, Syria, Saudi Arabia and among the troubled elements of European Muslim communities that the call to arms of the 'Iraqi Islamic mujahideen' has had significant resonance - not in 'the land of the two rivers', as the militants know it. Good news is thin, but Saddam is gone, though what followed him is arguably a greater threat than he ever was and tens, if not hundreds of thousands, have died. Much is still unclear - such as the consequences of the massive outflow of Iraqi refugees or the potential of newly discovered oilfields. One positive outcome is that, having learnt from their mistakes, the Americans and their allies are building a body of counter-insurgency, reconstruction and peace-building know-how that could, given the right circumstances, serve well in the decades to come. Ansari at St Andrews notes that Britain is now engaging seriously with the Middle East - with army officers going on Arabic or Farsi courses - for the first time since the early Seventies. These are expensive 'silver linings' to a fairly dark cloud, says Saeed at the LSE, though they may augur better times for the future. The war of 2003 was supposed to transform the Middle East, the broader Islamic world and its relations with the West. It was meant to release a wave of beneficial change. A transformation has happened, but not the one desired by the US and UK. If there is one law that has dominated events, it is the law of unintended consequences. Sadly, the result is that the gloomy predictions of the illiterate truck driver I interviewed at Zakho have largely come to pass."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
