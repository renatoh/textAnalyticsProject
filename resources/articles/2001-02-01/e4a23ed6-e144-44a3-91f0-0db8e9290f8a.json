Referee: Hellmut Krug (Germany) 1 No injury worries for United as they attempt to capitalise on their week-long break against a Valencia side playing on the back of a 10-hour journey from the Canary Islands, the location of the Spanish side's last league game. United kick-off and spray the ball wide to the right. 2 Silvestre plays in Cole 20 yards out, Cole rolls it on to Scholes in the area, and Scholes lays it off for Sheringham to miss a close-range chance. 4 Cole attempts to get around the back but Angloma runs him off the ball. 5 Giggs crosses from the left, high into the six-yard box but Sheringham is deemed to have fouled Canizares in the Valencia goal. 6 Good chance for Kily as he shoots over from 15 yards after being played in by Aimar. 8 Stam stops Aimar dead 30 yards out. 9 Neville, his goal against Aston Villa last month fresh in his mind, skips down the right past Kily and fires in a right-foot shot across the face of goal. 12 GOAL: Manchester United 1 - 0 Valencia Giggs finds Cole 20 yards out, Cole returns it, Canizares thinks that Giggs is about to shoot and shapes up just as Giggs passes to the on-running Cole again for the United striker to slide the ball home with his right foot at the near post. 17 Valencia free-kick after Beckham tussles with Kily near the centre circle. Baraca takes into the area, cleared for Kily to have a crack from distance; over the bar 18 Substitution Butt on for Giggs, who has tweaked his hamstring. 19 Sheringham wide on the left releases Cole through the middle. Cole gets behind Pellegrino depite an unnlucky bounce but shoots straight at Canizares. Possibly a better chance than the one that led to his goal. 24 United pinned back in their own half as Valencia get themselves together. 25 Great sweeping move by Valencia brings the ball out from their own half to the edge of the United area. Baraca finds Mendieta, who immediately releases Aimar into space with only Barthez to beat from an angle, but he shoots well wide of the far post 28 Baraca lobs the ball over the top to Carew in space on the far right side of the United area; Silvestre comes sliding in to disposess. 30 Aimar very unlucky to be caught offside when he would have been away on goal. 33 Butt gives away a free-kick 35 yards out; Valencia immediately win another 25 yards out and square-on to goal but Mendieta fails to to hit the target. 36 Beckham momentarily distracted wide on the right when he spots the linesman's stupendous moustache. 38 Sheringham floored by a knee in the back from Ayala; bizarrely, Sheringham is penalised. 39 United show signs of sitting back - bags of space opening up on the left for the home team but no one too willing to use it. Doesn't help having Giggs off the field. 40 Kily plays it out left from the edge of the area for Carboni to cross; wins a corner. Comes to nothing. Continued Valencia pressure before United break through the middle. Ends with Butt having a go from distance - straight at Canizares. 43 Valencia free-kick just outside the United area. Aimar thumps it and Barthez claims on the half-volley. 45 Another free-kick for Valencia in United's half; comes to nothing. Lots of movement from Valencia in response to United giving the ball away too much. Half-time. 46 Valencia get the second half underway. Scholes and Cole work the ball down the left before Cole is caught offside. 48 Silvestre starts to push up on the left in an attempt to fill the hole left by Giggs. 49 Booking Butt for chopping down Mendieta. 50 Kily does well to get past Beckham and Keane to the left of the United area. He plays a one-two and shoots for Barthez to save. 51 Keane pulls the ball back for Butt to shoot from 20 yards out; deflected clear. 53 Carboni plays a one-two with Aimar deep on the left for Valencia, but his great cross across the face of goal finds no one. 54 Valencia corner. Mendieta takes, Pellegrino heads down for Butt to clear; played back in for Barthez to claim. 59 Sweeping move involving Sheringham and Keane in the middle of the park allows Silvestre to get away and cross from near the by-line. 62 Stam gets in a cross from the by-line but Valencia clear. 63 Booking / substitution Beckham / Solskjaer on for Sheringham. 65 Substitution Sanchez on for Angulo. 66 United now effectively playing with only one up front and a five-man midfield. 68 Keane slices at a shot from a Solskjaer cross on the left. 69 Solskjaer burgles Angloma in the middle of the pitch; United get the edge of the area but the pitch lets them down and Valencia clear. Lots of huff and puff this half but nothing to raise the blood pressure. 71 Solskjaer races down the left, gets away from Angloma and crosses across the face of goal after Cole fails to get a touch. 74 Booking Baraca after he has a go at Beckham for a challenge in which the United player in fact got a foot on the ball, despite going in heavily. Lots of nattering at the ref from Valencia players, so the ref feels obliged to have a word with Beckham. 76 Substitution Vicente on for Kily. 78 Beckham avoids rising to the challenge after Carboni hacked him down and earned himself a booking. 80 Neville does well to get the better of Vicente near the by-line and cross through the six-yard box; Cole unable to get a touch. 86 Baraca denied an equaliser when he gets his head to a cross and Scholes clears off the line. 87 OWN GOAL: Manchester United 1 - 1 Valencia Bummer for United; Wes Brown deflected in from a Vicente close-range effort. 89 Abelda on for Aimar. 90 Not a lot to play for now as both teams try to make sure they don't lose. Pretty dull stuff for the entire match in fact, but full credit to Valencia for plugging away and forcing a point in a game that never really took off. Full-time: Manchester United 1 - 1 Valencia."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
