It has taken David Campbell eight years and \u00a39m to discover the answer to this question. But that wasn't his aim in 1998, when he dreamed up a plan to donate 300 classic books to every state secondary school in the UK. Campbell is the publisher of the Everyman's Library imprint, those distinctive pocket-sized hardback editions of the classics of world literature. On its title page each volume carries the same quotation from a medieval morality play: \"Everyman, I will go with thee and be thy guide.\" Not all schools, however, have appreciated the gift. A letter from one expressed \"dismay and sadness at the waste of money these books are ... even an Ofsted inspector asked me why I hadn't binned them\". \"The paper jackets are ugly and unattractive, and the binding is dull and boring ... what is needed is the familiar paperback format with attractive jackets and abridged editions,\" ran another. Yet another declared: \"The books are so unattractive they are unlikely to tempt any pupil.\" Most alarming, perhaps, was the pronouncement from one school that \"the language in all but a few of them is beyond the comprehension of most of the students we see ... The harsh reality of our secondary schools is that children just don't have the skills to tackle such complex ideas in the written format.\" Millennium project The idea behind the scheme began with an item Campbell heard on the radio one morning in the late 1990s: the Millennium Commission was giving \u00a346m to create bicycle paths. \"I was struck that, among the larger and very varied range of millennium projects, there was none that celebrated the English language and our exceptional literature,\" he says. The commission liked Campbell's proposal and agreed to stump up \u00a34m on the understanding that he would raise the same from other sources. And so the Millennium Library Trust was born. In all, \u00a39m was raised, enough to send sets of 300 books to some 4,150 schools across the UK, plus a further 1,700 sets to schools in 77 developing countries. Over eight years, a total of 1,715,000 books would be shifted, with a retail value of \u00a320m. Everyman agreed to produce them for cost price. Schools were quick to respond. The vast majority accepted their gift gracefully, many expressing joy over the packages of Jane Austen, the Brontes, Chaucer, Shakespeare, Dickens, Hardy, Proust, Dante, Homer et al, plus the King James Bible and the Qur'an, which have come at yearly intervals in batches of 50. \"Wonderful titles\", \"superb quality\", \"hugely enriched our library\" were typical of the phrases peppering the thank you letters. \"We are a low-achieving high school, but improving! I would never have been able to find the money in my meagre budget to buy copies of these classics,\" wrote one school librarian. We are \"hugely privileged to have a collection like this ... these wonderful books\", gushed another. With responses such as these, Campbell understandably feels vindicated. And he is delighted that a survey of 14- to 18-year-olds to mark the end of the scheme has revealed Pride and Prejudice to be their favourite of the 300 titles, followed by Lord of the Rings, Jane Eyre, Lord of the Flies and Oliver Twist. Campbell says it is difficult to put a precise figure on the number of schools that said no to the offer or returned the books. Up to 50 of the rejections were understandable because the schools in question were on the brink of being closed or knocked down, he says. \"Another 30 or 40 had no library or no sixth form, and you can perhaps understand that.\" There were \"maybe another 50\" that simply didn't want the books. \"Some turned them down perfectly politely, saying: 'these books are just too difficult for us'.\" He adds: \"It never occurred to me that anyone would turn this offer down. I didn't expect most school pupils to want to read Homer or Virgil, but I thought that there was more than a reasonable chance that quite a few could be coaxed to read M\u00e1rquez, Primo Levi, Hemingway, Waugh or even Chinua Achebe.\" Campbell confesses to a certain sympathy for the heads and librarians who sent letters complaining of decades of neglect from governments. \"I was the butt of their anger because they thought this was public money,\" he says. \"But this was not a government policy to foist all these highbrow books on them - it was a gift from a small publisher. \"Where I have less sympathy is where librarians or teachers have clearly thrown in the towel and don't believe anyone in the school can be inspired to read beyond the bare syllabus minimum. I can't believe that one would have had a refusal of such a gift in any other country in Europe, certainly not in eastern Europe. These books are the DNA of our civilisation. They should be available to everyone as they grow up.\" But in at least one of the schools that rejected the offer, the librarian is happy to defend the decision to send the books back. \"When a scheme like this goes on, and with these amounts of money, you really feel some research should be done into the actual schools,\" says Helena Read, who runs the library at Cotelands school, a small 11-16 comprehensive of 380 pupils in the Linconshire village of Ruskington. \"A lot of the time, decisions are made far away in ivory towers without considering the local situation. When I read the letter telling me how much had been spent, I could have ripped my hair out. I thought, if only they'd given me a tiny percentage of that money I could have bought this, this and this ...\" Books for today For her, \"the bottom line is getting the pupils to read, whether it's a newspaper, comic, novel or a magazine. In an ideal world, I would love it if the pupils came into my library and requested some of the classics, but the fact of the matter is that pupils today are living in today's world.\" She is adamant that Cotelands has keen readers. Only 20% of pupils have not borrowed a book from her library. Students have strong opinions on the books they enjoy and are willing to experiment, she says. Their favourite reads are anything by Jacqueline Wilson and the Alex Rider books. They are getting heavily into the Eragon series of fantasies by Christopher Paolini and the Young Bond thrillers by Charlie Higson. \"Kids love action and adventure. They want books that excite them and are current. They love fantasy,\" Read says. \"The books for nowadays are Manga, the Japanese comic books that you read from back to front.\" Aside from any presumed failings of the 300 classic titles on the action or adventure front, they are deficient in the looks and feel department, in her view. \"I think they are unappealing to youngsters and you've got to fit them into your school bag,\" she says. The Cotelands library does have some Austen and Dickens, but in paperback form, which, she says, the children prefer. Fundamentally, her library - \"about the size of the average house's living room\" - is not big enough for the 300 free books, she adds. \"I have no reference stock at the moment.\" Before she returned the books, she estimates about half a dozen were kept. Were they read? \"As far as I know.\" But when he came up with his scheme, Campbell did not, in fact, have much greater expectations than this: \"I believe strongly that if just one pupil in each school each year for the next 50 years has his or her life changed by new worlds being opened from reading outside the syllabus, this project will have been worthwhile.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
