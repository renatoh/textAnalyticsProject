On Wednesday, Waitrose is lowering the prices of more than 200 of its basic own-label products, including beef mince, tea and washing-up-liquid, by an average of more than 15%. The Co-op is investing \u00a350m in lowering the price of more than 300 branded and own-label products, including rice, pasta and coffee, by nearly 15% on average and introducing a new low-price range for shoppers on a budget. \u201cHonest Value\u201d will include 50 items, including British meat, soft drinks, fruit and vegetables. Jo Whitfield, the chief executive of the Co-op\u2019s food stores, said: \u201cValue is uppermost in the minds of shoppers.\u201d The UK\u2019s sixth- and eighth-largest supermarkets are taking action after their bigger rivals launched a price war in an attempt to win over more budget-conscious shoppers whose finances are under increased strain due to the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Tesco kicked off the pricing shift in June with a pledge to match Aldi on nearly 500 products \u2013 extending an existing promise to match the discounter on some items. Since then, Sainsbury\u2019s announced price cuts on 1,000 products, Asda said it would invest \u00a3100m on price cuts and Morrisons said it was cutting prices on 400 items in September by an average of 23%. Supermarkets are trying to avoid a repeat of their mistake in the last recession when discounters Aldi and Lidl, as well as the likes of B&amp;M and Poundland, took market share as the major grocers allowed themselves to be undercut. The price war has caused grocery inflation to more than halve to 1.9% since a peak of 4% in June and the focus on price is expected to sharpen further in the run up to a tricky festive season, according to market analysts at Kantar. It said 31% of grocery sales were linked to promotions in September \u2013 the highest proportion all year as price cuts were stepped up. With fears of the spread of the virus and lockdowns increasing, supermarkets are partly trying to win over shoppers who might be cautious about heading out to stores in the coming months and irritated by insufficient capacity to meet soaring demand for online shopping. The closure of many hospitality venues in some parts of the country is also adding to demand in stores. \u201cIt is going to be incredibly challenging to deal with the levels of demand given the restrictions in place because of Covid-19,\u201d said Richard Lim at Retail Economics. \u201cThe tactic is to build up a bit of loyalty ahead of Christmas.\u201d Limits on household mixing and fears about the end of the government\u2019s furlough scheme and rising unemployment mean that most families are likely to be \u201cless indulgent\u201d in their food spending in the run up to the festive period according to Lim. More than a third (36%) of shoppers expect to cut back on their festive spending, with just 12% of consumers expecting to spend more than last year according to Retail Economics."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
