Clearly, the focus was on games rather than hardware \u2013 at least until the end \u2013 and fans got what they wanted, beginning with an enhanced GTA V and moving on through new Spider-Man, Horizon Zero Dawn, Hitman and Ratchet &amp; Clank titles. The finale was the reveal of the PlayStation 5 console itself, a radical re-think of the machine\u2019s lineage, abandoning the all black colouring we\u2019ve seen in the last three machines in favour of a futuristic white and black monolith. Compared to the recent Xbox Series X games stream, which focused on original indie titles, this was something of a fan-pleasing big brand onslaught from Sony [Update: there were also plenty of interesting independent titles too, including Stray and Little Devil Inside, making this a more rounded presentation]. But we\u2019re yet to discover how many of these titles are exclusives, or even timed exclusives, beyond the first party games. And we still don\u2019t know when this thing is coming out and what price it\u2019ll be. They saved it right til the end, but Sony has finally revealed the form factor of the PlayStation 5, an ultra futuristic robot white machine, with gliding lines and a black central stratum. This is a really radical look, like something out of an Alex Garland script. The console will come in two versions: a standard model and a digital machine. It\u2019ll be accompanied by a 3D camera. Horizon: Zero Dawn gets a sequel - more organic creatures join the robo-dinos from the original as Aloy tries to battle a sickness destroying the world. Incredible underwater scenes and jaw-dropping desert vistas. This one will be good. It\u2019s called Horizon: Forbidden West. Pragmata looks to be a futuristic Earth escape adventure with an astronaut, a girl android and a robotic cat. Cats are very much the pets of the night. Intense Japanese horror here from Capcom: Resident Evil 8. First-person, like Resi 7. Victorian vibes a la Bloodborne. Looks frankly terrifying. Not quite sure if it\u2019s called Village: Resident Evil or Resident Evil 8. Oh wow, so Death Loop is a first-person assassinate-\u2019em-up seemingly set in some sort of futuristic game where rival killers are stuck in a time loop fighting continually until they work out how to escape. The grindcore styling is very Tarantino/Rodriguez and the stealth/shoot gameplay is very much the mainstay of developer Arcane Lyon, previously responsible for Dishonored. This looks fun. IT\u2019S HAPPENING! IT\u2019S HAPPENING! I\u2019m sorry. Okay - it\u2019s Demon\u2019s Souls, looking like it probably did in the heads of everyone I raved at about it in 2009. This is the predecessor to Dark Souls, the founder of the Soulslike genre, the game that put FromSoftware and director Hidetaka Miyazaki on the path to global fame. I\u2019m very very happy. Some Australian beaver things are marvelling at an anthropomorphic strawberry. What\u2019s going on? Of course this is from the creators of Octodad. Looks like a kind of gardening/survival game hybrid (?) with weird cute little creatures that can morph into... foods. It\u2019s called BUGSNAX. End of this year for that one. Little Devil Inside looks like an extremely quirky and interesting fantasy RPG adventure with a very Gallic sense of humour. NBA 2K21 now - I can\u2019t pretend I have anything useful to say about basketball but... it looks very... realistic? Such... visible sweat? That\u2019ll be a launch title this autumn. PlayStation\u2019s cute little robot mascots return in Astro\u2019s Playroom from Japan Studio - looks to be a cute wee multiplayer minigame collection, or a platformer showcase, or the like. Ah Hitman III is here. It\u2019ll be Agent 47\u2019s most intimate assassination mission yet apparently, and it\u2019ll conclude the modern trilogy. Io Interactive goes on to show a very short clip of a mission in Dubai, bringing to mind the Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol movie. A new game from Heart Machine, creators of Hyper Light Drifter: Solar Ash, featuring a similar barren-planet colour palette and escheresque worlds. Just a thought: a lot of these games are for 2021 or undated. I\u2019m wondering if many of them were launch games that are now not going to be ready in time. Thanks COVID. Here\u2019s a PvP melee combat game from Gearbox: Godfall, coming later this year. I have no idea what Jett: The Far Shore is but the Bladerunner-style music was beautiful. Looks to be some sort of space colony sim. It\u2019s by Canadian studio Superbrothers, creators of Sword &amp; Sworcery EP so should be amazing. Tango Games\u2019 Ghostwire: Tokyo making a return from the dead here - appropriately, as it\u2019s about seeing ghosts. A ludicrously good-looking Tokyo is home to creepy headless schoolgirls, portals to other dimensions and other creepy apparitions. It\u2019s a first-person game with a bit of a Dishonored/Bioshock supernatural combat thing going on. Coming 2021. Ah next up, a new title in the Oddworld series of comedic distopian action platformers, subtitled Soulstorm. Looks to have the grimy look and dark humour of the original titles. Have you ever wanted to play a fantasy monster furry high-school drama anime? Good news - KO_OP\u2019s Goodbye Volcano High is definitely for you. Coming 2021. Kena: Bridge of Spirits is the next trailer, an action adventure from indie studio Ember Lab. Who remembers Kameo: Elements of Power? For a second there I thought Kena: Bridge of Spirits was a VERY unlikely sequel. Extremely online-looking vehicular/on-foot combat MAYHEM on display here in Destruction Allstars, which seems spiritually connected to Destruction Derby. I detect Fortnite\u2019s aesthetic influence. Ooh next up, a new spin-off from the LittleBigPlanet series. Sack Boy: A Big Adventure looks to be a new isometrically viewed 3D platforming romp featuring Media Molecule\u2019s lovable rag doll hero. Astonishingly realistic sci-fi faces feature in the new Housemarque game, which seems to involve replaying an endless cycle of landing on an alien planet and dying horribly. Excellent! Big Edge of Tomorrow and Lost Planet vibes. It\u2019s called Returnal (ouch), no release date yet. Offbeat publisher Annapurna Interactive has just shown a gorgeous trailer for, um, a cyberpunk cat game called Stray. Near-future neon-drenched city scapes and feline heroes? Could this BE more zeitgeist? Very important question re: Stray - do we play as the cat? Here\u2019s a trailer. A brief glimpse of a new game from Square Enix there: Project Athia. Dragons and fantasy, created specifically for the PS5. I gotta say I didn\u2019t expect to be so blown away by the graphics here - games already look pretty amazing after all. But LOOK at Ratchet and Clank, every frame could be from a Pixar movie Insomniac Games has revealed Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, a new adventure for the platforming duo, enhanced with lots of modern visual effects, such as... yes... ray tracing. It just wouldn\u2019t be a PlayStation event without Gran Turismo, would it? The prettiest cars, the most reflections, it\u2019s surely more realistic than actual real driving at this point. Gran Turismo 7 has no release date yet. Sony isn\u2019t messing about. Announcement two is Spider-Man: Miles Morales, a follow-up to the hugely acclaimed Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man. It\u2019ll be a launch title in winter this year. Hang on a minute... I feel like I\u2019m having serious deja vu here. Is this really GTA5, again? Has Rockstar not made enough money from it yet? Well, if you want to play it AGAIN in 2021, it\u2019ll be enhanced and expanded on PlayStation 5. Damn, I really thought I\u2019d summoned GTA 6 into existence by sheer force of will for a second there Is it just me or is there something a bit 2oo1: A Space Odyssey about this? Just waiting for the inevitable sizzle reel now to kick things off... Talking about PS3, Microsoft has made backwards compatibility a BIG part of its Xbox Series X hype, promising many hundreds of Xbox, Xbox 360 and Xbox One titles ready and compatible from day one on the new machine, via disc or digital download. During Mark Cerny\u2019s PS5 lecture, Sony claimed that it had tested compatibility with the Top 100 PS4 games, getting most to work on the next system, but there was little info on whether PS3, PS2 or PlayStation 1 titles would be supported. These events are just so slick now. Scripted, live-streamed, expensive... up until about 2005 it was just execs standing in front of graphs in a medium-sized room, talking to about 40 journalists. I kinda prefer it this way. RIIIIIIIIDGE RACERRRRR! What a throwback! Remember the absolute fiasco that was the PlayStation 3 announcement? 599 US dollars and giant enemy crabs? Ken Kutaragi suggesting that gamers would happily get second jobs to pay for it? The PS2\u2019s EMOTION ENGINE? Good times. Okay, I would love to see something new from Fumito Ueda, the creator of Shadow of the Colossus and Last Guardian. I know it\u2019s unlikely, but I\u2019m just thinking about the architectural and emotional marvels he could conceive on this platform. And I know it\u2019s all about Gran Turismo these days, but I\u2019d be excited to see a Ridge Racer game as agenda-setting and hyper-stylised as Type 4 but with next-gen visuals. What games would you love to see tonight, Keith? I think there\u2019s about a 5% chance of this happening, as we all know that Rockstar marches to the beat of its own drum, but I would be very excited to see Grand Theft Auto 6. We know it\u2019s been in development a long while and it\u2019s definitely not a swansong game for the current generation of consoles, like GTA5 was for the Xbox 360 and PS3. Oh, and Knack 3. Of course. As for the release date and price... So far, Sony is sticking with the \u201cHoliday 2020\u201d announcement, despite the Covid-19 crisis, which means it\u2019ll arrive any time from the end of October until early December \u2013 just like Xbox Series X. It\u2019ll be interesting to see who blinks first and provides an actual date. Price-wise, there have been rumours online of a \u00a3599 start point for PS5, which is high for a console, especially in these challenging times, but not totally unrealistic considering how favourably the tech specs compare with a mid-range PC. The holding music playing on the PlayStation 5 stream is very Ministry of Sound chill-out room circa 1998. A bit of good news for those of us who have no chance whatsoever of conquering their PlayStation 4 pile of shame by the end of the year: the PS5 is going to be backwards-compatible with PS4 games (100 of them at first, more as time goes on). It\u2019ll also work with existing PSVR headsets. I\u2019ve also heard a rumour that\u2019s popped up a few times in the last couple of years: the FromSoftware\u2019s Demon\u2019s Souls, the spiritual predecessor to Dark Souls and the start of my own Souls obsession, is getting a PS5 remaster. Other rumours have claimed Bloodborne might be getting updated too, but I\u2019ve never heard that personally. There has been a LOT of speculation about the games Sony will announce tonight. At the top of the list is a new Gran Turismo, which is certainly overdue (but then when isn\u2019t Gran Turismo overdue?). There are bets on a Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man sequel, as well as a follow-up to Guerrilla\u2019s sci-fi adventure Horizon Zero Dawn. God of War 2 is another distinct possibility. Might we also get news of an enhanced version of Last of Us 2? Japan Studio has been quiet of late, so there\u2019s always the possibility of something new and interesting from them... Meanwhile, Sony has already told us all about the new controller: the DualSense (as opposed to the PS4\u2019s DualShock). It features \u201cadvanced haptic feedback\u201d and adaptive triggers that can resist the pressure of your fingers. The Share button is now the Create button, which gives players options for livestreaming, screenshotting and sharing. It also has a built-in microphone so you can chat in multiplayer without a headset. I like the look, personally, even if it\u2019s a bit mid-00s service robot. If you want to swot up a little more, check out the article we wrote just after PS5 system architect Mark Cerny gave his online developer talk in March. So here is what we know about PlayStation 5 so far. Earlier this year Sony revealed all of the technical specifications, with an AMD Zen 2-based eight-core central processor, a graphics chipset capable of 10.28 TFLOPs and running at 2.23GHz, and 16GB of system memory. The console will come with a built in 825GB solid state drive, which will allow extremely fast loading times, and it will support advanced visual effects such as real-time ray tracing. Finally, PS5 boasts the Tempest 3D Audio engine for authentic surround-sound effects. I\u2019m taking bets on how many times I accidentally type \u201cPlayStation 4\u201d instead of \u201cPlayStation 5\u201d tonight. Seven years\u2019 worth of muscle memory is hard to overcome! Normally we\u2019d be typing this frantically in some massive auditorium or cramped hotel lobby in LA as this reveal happened at E3, but due to *gestures wildly at everything* we all get to watch from the comfort of our own homes. It has its advantages; I\u2019ve got beers on standby. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s liveblog of the PlayStation 5 reveal! I\u2019m video games editor Keza MacDonald, and I\u2019ll be joined tonight by games correspondent Keith Stuart as we get our first look at the PlayStation 5 console and its first games. The stream kicks off in about an hour, so we\u2019ll go through what we know already and engage in a bit of informed speculation beforehand."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
