A late withdrawal from by Spanish side Malaga, who forsook their place in the competition in order to give their players a proper summer break, means that Bobby Robson's men face a return to competitive fixtures in three weeks' time. \"We were very pleased to hear from the Football Association yesterday offering us a place in the Intertoto Cup,\" Newcastle executive Russell Cushing said today. \"If we achieve a Uefa Cup spot through this competition it would be a tremendous boost for the club. The competition, which guarantees three clubs entry into the Uefa cup - a prize last won by an English club when West Ham qualified two seasons ago - kicked off last weekend. Newcastle will enter as a seeded team - along with Aston Villa - in the third round and their first match is scheduled away for the weekend of 14/15 July. Their likely opponents are to be either Belgian side Sporting Lokeren or Polish side Zaglebie Lubin who have both built commanding leads in the first leg of their first round ties. Assuming they progress then Newcastle await the winner of the resulting second round match and will welcome them to St. James Park for the second leg on 21 July. The late chance to play in the Intertoto Cup means Newcastle have cancelled plans to travel to Sweden for pre-season training and matches against Gothenburg and German sides Bayer Leverkusen or Hertha Berlin due to a clash of dates. The good news for Newcastle and their fans came only a day after they heard Andy Griffin, 23, Nolberto Solano, 26, and goalkeeper Steve Harper, 26, had all signed new contracts with the club."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
