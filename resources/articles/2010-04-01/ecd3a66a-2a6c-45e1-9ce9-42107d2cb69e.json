Had one of our teams got to the final the squad would have had some very notable absentees for what is a big phase of our preparation. \"Now we will all get together and can get some good solid grounding in as a whole. I'm sure from that perspective Mr Capello is happy.\" The Champions League final is on 22 May. The World Cup kicks off in South Africa on 11 June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
