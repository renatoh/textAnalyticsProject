A friendly international three days before the start of the season, played at a neutral ground in Switzerland, is always going to divide opinion, particularly when there are so many people wondering how Fifa calculated its latest rankings and a queue of Premier League managers wait to remind us why this is the least popular date in the international calendar. Hodgson has also convened his new-look squad at a time when the feelgood stories coming out of the Olympics have highlighted some of the areas in which football has been heading in the wrong direction. In the coming weeks, with the full details of John Terry's alleged racial abuse to get another airing at an FA hearing, there will be inevitably more unfavourable comparisons. Hodgson has already said that footballers need to learn from the Olympic spirit. David Bernstein, the FA chairman, has said the same. The message has been conveyed to the players preparing for Wednesday's game against Italy in Berne and there are indications that they recognise the issue. \"We're not special, we're not better than anyone else,\" Jack Butland, who will make his debut in place of the injured Joe Hart, said. \"I just think it's the borderline between confidence and arrogance. Any professional needs to be confident but there is a line between that and arrogance. \"You just need to be very careful what you say and how things are worded and how things are done. Not a lot of people step over that line but it's a very careful line because it can taint people's views of you and, once you've lost that, it can be very difficult to get it back. It's a very fine line which, if you do overstep it, can upset or annoy people.\" Tom Cleverley, who will also make his first appearance for the national team, picked up on the same theme. \"The way sport was showcased in the Olympics was an example to every athlete in every sport. The sportsmanship and the respect everyone had for another, it was just first class.\" Cleverley has played only 15 games for Manchester United but already has his own website, the TC23 brand and, very soon, a clothing range. Yet here, too, was a man who seemed slightly embarrassed by the suggestion that someone in his position could no longer go shopping by himself. \"I still go to the local Co-op and Tesco,\" he pointed out. \"I still push my trolley around.\" Butland, the 19-year-old Birmingham City goalkeeper, played with Cleverley in the Great Britain Olympics team. \"The main thing for us at the Olympics was that it wasn't just a football thing. It was so much more than that. It was Team GB and we were just a small part of that. We were on a level playing field with the swimmers, the athletes and the divers. We were just another part of it. That was a massive thing in not getting ahead of ourselves.\" These are two of the players who stand to gain the most from the Italy international and, though August friendlies always create controversy, anyone who contests it is a meaningless fixture should consider that England have their first World Cup qualifiers against Moldova and Ukraine next month, followed by two more against San Marino and Poland in October. Hodgson is not just preparing for those games but bringing in younger players with a view to 2014 in Brazil, with the logistical plans for that tournament accelerating behind the scenes. A delegation of FA officials, including the England manager, has already been on a fact-finding trip to Brazil, with Rio the preferred base. Frank Lampard will captain the side in Berne but Alex-Oxlade Chamberlain has suffered an ankle injury and joined Hart and Daniel Sturridge in pulling out. Joleon Lescott has been brought in but will not come up against his Manchester City team-mate Mario Balotelli, who is out of the Italy squad because of the conjunctivitis that meant he played no part in the Community Shield. Otherwise the match represents the first chance for Michael Carrick to resurrect his international career now he and Hodgson have found common ground over his frustrations about the midfielder being restricted to 15 starts and seven substitute appearances in the 11 years since making his England debut. \"One of the best players I'll ever play with,\" Cleverley said of his Manchester United team-mate. \"Sometimes you need to see it first-hand with Michael to realise how good he is. But the level of players in midfield must be good if he has only 22 caps.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
