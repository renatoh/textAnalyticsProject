It was a tweet that meant little but you suspect Koukash\u2019s social media offerings after Thursday night\u2019s match will be slightly more complimentary. He walked out of the fixture early 12 months ago but after this performance \u2013 spearheaded by the outstanding half-back Robert Lui \u2013 Koukash must have been keen to stay and celebrate all night. It is only round two but this was arguably the finest Salford performance since he assumed control of the club three years ago \u2013 and certainly the best since Ian Watson took charge as the coach midway through last season. Lui, the former North Queensland half-back who arrived in Super League with a considerable reputation, will grab most of the headlines after his two tries but this was as rounded a team performance as you are likely to see. \u201cRobert is obviously a very good player,\u201d Watson said afterwards. \u201cHowever, our middle men really stood up which allowed Robert and Michael [Dobson] to play. There\u2019s been some questions thrown our way but the belief we showed was exceptional.\u201d This was far from ideal preparation for next week\u2019s World Club Series for Saints. Had Sydney Roosters, their opponents in the three-match tournament, stayed up late in Dubai to watch this performance, they would have been wishing the game was tomorrow. \u201cYou could smell an air of complacency about the lads before the game,\u201d said the St Helens coach, Keiron Cunningham. \u201cI spoke to the staff about it but once they cross the line, you can\u2019t do anything.\u201d Already without the injured hooker James Roby, Saints\u2019 problems were compounded with another for the in-form centre Mark Percival that Cunningham said \u201cdoesn\u2019t look good\u201d. By the time Percival was withdrawn midway through the second half, though, the game was over. A superb kick from Lui\u2019s half-back partner Dobson set the tone as he found Greg Johnson unmarked in the corner to break the deadlock and from there Salford never let up. They were 18-0 up after 12 minutes following tries for Craig Kocpzak and another from Lui before the visitors offered a brief response with an Alex Walmsley try. Luke Walsh was sent to the sin-bin on the half-hour and that allowed Salford the chance to kill off the game and tries from Niall Evalds and a second from Lui, both of which followed rampaging breaks from the winger Justin Carney, put them out of sight by the interval. Carney in particular was a sight to behold, looking every inch the winger he was at Castleford, terrorising the Saints defence almost every time he touched the ball. The second half was slightly more tolerable for Saints but the damage had long since been done. Adam Swift managed a consolation but tries from Adam Walne, an outstanding solo score from Dobson and a second for Evalds rubber-stamped a remarkable match for the Red Devils.
