Hauliers who said they had to run the gauntlet of increasingly daring and aggressive attempts by stowaways to get to Britain were joined by farmers, shopkeepers and business owners on the march, which closed the A16 motorway outside the Channel port. A convoy of about 40 lorries and trucks was joined by 50 tractors and several hundred marchers who formed a human chain to converge on the access roads to the tunnel and ferry terminals. The blockade came to an end on Monday night. A Eurotunnel spokesman said it was understood the protesters agreed to end the blockade following concessions from the government. Representatives came away from a meeting with the state representative of the region, Fabienne Buccio, with a new commitment \u2013 but no date \u2013 that the camp would be completely dismantled \u201cin a single step\u201d. Buccio also said a special fund to help businesses in need would be activated and more than 230 extra security staff brought in, bringing the total to over 2,000. However, the hauliers threatened to stage fresh protests and keep blocking the A16 if the migrant camp is not dismantled. Eurotunnel said on Monday night that the protest had dispersed and traffic would be back to normal on Tuesday. A spokesman told the Press Association: \u201cEurotunnel services have been operating normally all day. Some freight traffic was held back but, due to a lot of discussion and forward planning before the protest, most had been diverted and came at the weekend or last week.\u201d France\u2019s interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, pledged last week to dismantle the Calais camp, Europe\u2019s biggest and most notorious open-air squat, which is now home to between 7,000 and 10,000 migrants and refugees. Many of them are desperate to reach Britain. The former French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, who hopes to stand again in 2017, called on the British to set up their own holding centre on the other side of the Channel. But Eric Fiolet, a local haulier and one of the demonstration\u2019s organisers, said during the protest that the time for talking was over. \u201cIt\u2019s action we want, not promises that may or may not be kept. I don\u2019t know of any other industry or any other workers that have to put up with being attacked the way we are every night. Our people risk being hurt or having their lorries, which are their livelihoods, destroyed.\u201d He added: \u201cPressure has been building up for three and a half years. We have exhausted all possibility of discussions and negotiations. Today our backs are against the wall.\u201d Over the Channel, the Road Haulage Association (RHA) said lorry drivers would stand their ground until action to dismantle the camp was taken and predicted the traffic chaos in France would have a knock on effect on traffic on Britain\u2019s south coast; however, the Port of Calais said a diversion had been put in place and ferries were operating as normal. \u201cThis will bring yet further misery to hauliers bound for mainland Europe and of course for the people and businesses of Kent,\u201d RHA chief executive Richard Burnett said. However, he added: \u201cThere needs to be a clear plan that shows how the camp is going to be dismantled. Drivers have been attacked on a daily basis for months. And there has been insufficient resource to protect.\u201d On Monday, farmers, truck drivers and local residents spoke of their growing fear, frustration and anger at the failure of French, British and European politicians to solve Calais\u2019 migrant problem. The term most often used was ras-le-bol; which literally means to have a bowl full, but translates as being fed up. Local officials say tourists now snub the historic Channel town, with long and close links to Britain, because of its association with the human misery and violence of the camp. But while Calaisiens spoke of being angry and fed up, many also had sympathy for the plight of the migrants and refugees in their midst, living in squalor in a shanty town of makeshift tents and plastic shelters. \u201cWe are not racist and we are not Front National [the far-right party of Marine Le Pen]. We understand there is a humanitarian question here, that there are people living in misery, but we are living with incivility and a growing feeling of insecurity,\u201d Jean-Pierre Clipet, of the FDSEA farmers\u2019 union, said. People smugglers are reported to be going to extreme lengths in Calais to get people to the UK, with reports of vehicles being torched, petrol bombs thrown and trees being felled to block roads before drivers are threatened with chainsaws and machetes. Gangs are often paid thousands of pounds by vulnerable people to get them to Calais, from where some are smuggled to Britain. Christophe Delacourt, 49, a maintenance technician with Eurotunnel, showed the Guardian photographs on his telephone of his car windscreen \u2013 smashed, he said, by angry migrants and refugees. \u201cI was driving to work at 5am last Tuesday when about 20 to 30 of them tried to get on a lorry. When it didn\u2019t stop and they failed, they grabbed tree branches and started attacking my car. Of course, I was afraid.\u201d Delacourt said Eurotunnel had advised its employees to take smaller roads to work during the night. Sebastien Fournier, 36, who joined the human-chain march, said his wife was now afraid to drive to the supermarket with their young child in the car. \u201cThis isn\u2019t normal. Every day it\u2019s getting worse and worse. We don\u2019t want confrontation with the migrants. We just want to go to work. And it\u2019s sad because it\u2019s turning the local population racist.\u201d Ludovic Demol, 45, said he was driving to work at 5am on the A16 two months ago with three colleagues when they stopped at roadblocks. \u201cA hundred or so men attacked our car with iron bars and sticks. We got out and ran away. You can imagine how frightened I was.\u201d Pressure has been growing on the French authorities to tackle the problems at the camp, which has expanded in recent months. Talks took place on Friday between protest organisers and Cazeneuve, who has promised to gradually dismantle the camp and move asylum seekers to other locations in France. Farmers complain that the migrants make their way back and that dispersing them just shifts the problem elsewhere. Pierre-Yves, 47, who drove one of the tractors blocking the roads said: \u201cWe are not racist, we are not political, but we are in a situation that is not going away and we\u2019re having difficulty seeing the end, the solution. Farmlands are being camped on, crops damaged, and our turnover is hit. \u201cThis area has always welcomed migrants. The Polish came to work in the mines, Belgians like my grandmother came to work in the lace industry. But back then there were jobs and work. In the current economic situation, it\u2019s not possible.\u201d Other farmers fear the increasing violence will lead to tragedy. Vincent Cocquet, 41, said \u201cWe now confront this problem day after day, night after night and we all fear this is going to finish badly. Very badly.\u201d Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Van Gansbeke, president of the Calais business and shop owners collective, said Monday\u2019s action was just a start. \u201cWe won\u2019t be moving until the state gives us a date for the total dismantling of the northern zone of the Jungle,\u201d he said. French authorities have made repeated efforts to shut down the camp, which the state was responsible for creating in April 2015 when authorities evicted migrants and refugees from squats and outdoor camps across the Calais area and concentrated them into one patch of wasteland without shelter. Earlier this year, Calais residents and business leaders sent a delegation to see the president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, at the Elys\u00e9e Palace to demand that the region be declared in a \u201cstate of exceptional economic catastrophe\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
