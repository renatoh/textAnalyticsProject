The slender stilettoes immortalised by TV's Sex And The City are half-price. It's Manolo madness. The sale at the midtown Manhattan boutique saw the footwear hitting prices as low as $257 last week. Such a shoe would normally cost $515. By British standards, $515 is reasonable, $257 is cheap - or, rather, as inexpensive as Manolo Blahniks get. But $257 at an exchange rate of $1.8 to the pound? That's less than \u00a3150 - and that's ridiculous. Low, lower, lowest. There has not been a better time to go shopping in America for a decade. Okay, so it's bitterly cold in New York at the moment, but jumpers are on sale at Abercrombie &amp; Fitch for as little as $14. For years, you would have been smug that that came in at just under a tenner. Now $14 translates as \u00a37.77. Which is sublime. Propose marriage at the top of the Empire State Building and you can buy a diamond engagement ring at Tiffany &amp; Co for the equivalent of \u00a3500, then celebrate at Nobu in trendy TriBeCa over a sushi blow-out for \u00a3100 for two - unheard of in London. Shopping, eating out and staying in hotels has traditionally been cheaper in New York than London. But mix in a crashing dollar, seasonal discounts, promotional packages and prices that never fully recovered from the terrorist attacks of 2001, and you have nothing less than a bonanza for the British. Electronics, fashion, baubles, scent - cram your bags with the basics or splash out on select big-ticket items. It has yet to be proven that shopping is a cure for Seasonal Affective Disorder. But New York can at least boast of being the city where, for the moment, the retail addict's adage comes most alive: the more you spend the more you save. Where to shop The abundance of boutiques in SoHo, top fashion chains on Fifth Avenue, the Rockefeller Center and designer decadence uptown on Madison Avenue is also complemented by \"districts\" throughout Manhattan where store types cluster. Fashion Nolita, or \"North of Little Italy\", is a small five block by four segment downtown. Although just across Broadway from SoHo (South of Houston Street), Nolita has not yet been slicked up by big business and glossy galleries. It is teeming with women's couture and jewellery boutiques - but is also increasingly a place where hip guys can slink around and mysteriously emerge from a doorway with designer duds without even looking as if they are shopping. Duncan Quinn is a British lawyer who doubles as a fashion designer. The result is his eponymous clothier on Spring Street in Nolita, where bespoke suits in a cashmere mix can be had for $2,500 or pret \u00e0 porter for $1,650, shirts from $275,cufflinks from $100. \"It is almost in the style of a Savile Row tailor with a twist. I tried to make it a gentlemen's emporium with contemporary style. And Nolita is edgy,\" said Quinn. He imports Jeffrey West shoes from the UK and says the exchange rate is killing him. Round the corner on Mott Street, INA is a designer resale boutique for men - a second-hand shop with a difference. Prada suits that have been worn once for a fashion shoot or on the runway will cost $400, while the same suit new would cost $2,000 at the Prada store in SoHo, and probably \u00a32,000 in the UK. INA sells Gucci trousers for $95 and Helmut Lang shoes for $35. Paul Frank has an outlet on Mulberry Street in Nolita, not far from other men's boutiques with names such as Prohibit and Unis . Meanwhile, Time Out New York has crucial tips every week on \"sample sales\", where designers randomly throw one-day sales to clear stock at a pittance. Shoes You cannot fail to get shod on the strip of 8th Avenue in Greenwich Village, between Fifth and Sixth Avenues. The bad news is that Ugg boots are sold out until April. Those who don't mind imitations will be satisfied by a trip to Steve Madden 's shoe shops in SoHo, Chelsea or the Upper East Side, where frighteningly similar boots to Ugg are $99 a pair. Timberland boots can be snagged almost anywhere for $79. Jeans On the strip of Broadway between Houston and Canal, there are several huge branches of OMG Jeans Store where Levi 501s can be as cheap as $30; Seven jeans are $120. For popularised working men's brands Carhartt and Dickies, try Dirty Jane's across the street or Iceberg Army and Navy a block down on Broadway. Lingerie Victoria's Secret has outlets all over, with lacy undies from $9. But on Delancey and Hester Streets in the Lower East Side, there is more elastic and wire in combination than you can shake a suspender at. Jewellery The diamond district dispenses the bulk of the world's sparklers from jewellery stores on one block of Fifth Avenue at 47th Street, while the so-called silver district is found in the Upper 50s streets between Madison and Second Avenues. Perfume and make-up Macy's , Bloomingdales , Lord &amp; Taylor and Saks Fifth Avenue are awash with potions, perfumes and offers of a free makeover. At Macy's, 75ml Issey Miyake aftershave is $40, 50ml Chanel No 5 eau de toilette is $54, Clinique lipstick and mascara are $13.50 and Clinique moisturiser is $22. Pop it all in your Marc Jacob's handbag - from $495 at Saks. Gadgets New Yorkers like to warn tourists to steer clear of the gadget shops around Times Square, saying it is easy to get duped into overpaying or being sold a refurbished item as new. The best stores for digital cameras, iPods and the like are a little spread out but worth the trek. A reliable chain store is Circuit City , which has a huge outlet on 14th Street at Union Square, next to a Virgin Megastore, where chart CDs are typically $12.99. Best Buy , ever reliable, is on 23rd Street at Sixth Avenue. But the most competitive prices in town are to be found at J&amp;R Music and Computer on Park Row in Lower Manhattan, and at B&amp;H on Ninth Avenue at 33rd Street - although be aware that B&amp;H is closed on Friday afternoons and all day Saturday because it is run by Orthodox Jews. At B&amp;H, an iPod 40GB costs $489, while a basic Canon Powershot SD 100 Digital Elph camera (sold as the Ixus in the UK) costs $259.95. A Sony TRV 33 camcorder costs $729. B&amp;H does not sell computer games, but GameBoy Advance costs $79 at J&amp;R. Where to refuel In Nolita, try the cosy but ultra-hip eateries of Public , Peasant , Cafe Gitane or Cafe Lebowitz . Basketball hero Michael Jordan has opened a steakhouse in the refurbished Grand Central Station, where a steak costs from $22. Michael's , uptown at West 55th, on the other hand, is one of the most famous restaurants in New York and is usually dotted with celebrities. You might not normally consider splashing out on a $22 breakfast, or a $75 dinner with a $40 bottle of wine, but with the exchange rate as it is, perhaps now is the time. Where to unwind When the shopping has finished you off, it is time for a spa treatment. The Spa at the St Regis Hotel on Fifth Avenue offers Shoppers' Reflexology, a specialist foot massage for $180. They encourage you to follow this with afternoon tea at $37.50. Where to stay Perhaps the ultimate boutique spa and hotel in town is Soho House (+212 627 9800, sohohouseny.com), actually in the Meatpacking District. It boasts a cinema, top restaurant, roof pool and spa. Room rates for non-members start at $275 while, Monday to Thursday, a massage, facial, manicure and pedicure costs $150 in total. At the Chelsea Lodge (+212 243 4499, chelsealodge.com), $195-a-night suites are designed as studio apartments with kitchens. The Millenium Hilton (+212 693 2001, hilton.com), overlooking Ground Zero, is one of a range of hotels featured by NYC &amp; Company (nycvisit.com), the city's marketing organisation, in its winter Paint The Town initiative.
