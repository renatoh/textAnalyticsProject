The answer is probably 60% of the former and 40% Mr Stability. The son of the manse swore repeatedly on the bible of neo-liberalism while he set out to achieve a more equal society by stealth. He certainly covered his tracks. Labour took office on a rising curve and the good news has, largely, continued. Gordon Brown and Tony Blair did not ruffle the golden goose. The 20th century association between Labour and economic crisis was at last broken. At 75% the employment rate is now pushing towards the highest level ever recorded. By the end of last year the Labour Force survey said fewer than 1.5m people were out of work; the count of those claiming social benefits now shows under 1m. We are all now better off. For every \u00a3100 of retail spending on the eve of the 1997 election, consumers have \u00a3114, households some \u00a345bn more in total. Under Labour the economy grew by 2.6% a year on average, compared with the Tories' 2% during 1979-1997, which of course includes two downturns. Under Labour the ranks of higher-rate income tax payers swelled by 100,000. Some got a lot more to pay tax on: salaries of chief executives of FTSE 100 companies improved from \u00a3463,00 in 1998-1999 to \u00a3490,000 a year later. Labour promised price inflation at 2.5% a year. It undershot. Annual inflation is now below 1% on some measures. But inflation had been on target prior to the election. Did operational independence for the Bank of England make such a big difference? Old skeletons have not stopped rattling away in the Treasury's closet. Productivity is still well below those allegedly bloated welfare states France and Germany. A strong pound cheapened imports so it took the chancellor a while to express concern about sterling's appreciation - by some 20% against the euro between January 1999 and last autumn. This helped the trade deficit grow though few seemed to worry. Those that did noted how the UK balance of payments was financed by volatile inflows as the ratio of UK long-term assets to liabilities deteriorated. Labour showed no wish to push the UK to a higher position in the league table of government size; we remain well under France and Germany but above Japan and the US. Mr Brown said size did not matter. What did was whether the state created conditions for business success. Longbridge (then Llanwern) symbolised business failure. Yet if the board of BMW decided to relocate what right had third way ministers to demur? The Blairites wanted to move the UK hop, skip and jump into the internet age; the trouble was a lot of Labour voters, let alone productivity gains, depend on manufacturing still. Mr Brown got new money in. Business taxes were worth 3.5% of GDP in 1998-99 but 3.9% in 2001-2002, not bad in a world where globalisation is supposed to forbid one-country hits on the private sector. There was cash, too, from an act of old-fashioned socialist expropriation, the windfall tax on the utilities. Labour deprivileged marriage, made company cars dearer, house purchase a little harder (by cutting mortgage tax relief), penalised motorists and smokers. It pushed money towards working families, pensioners and, marginally, helped drinkers. Looked at in the round, this was a government which asked no fundamental questions about the functioning of the economic system or its fairness. In an ageing Britain, Labour upheld the Thatcherite settlement on provision for old age - it is basically up to individuals. Financial markets have been buoyant and no one has worried much. But things may not always get better and in retrospect the government's silence over the fate of Equitable Life - a straw in the wind? - may appear ominous. \u0095 Tomorrow: did things get fairer? Do you think things got better? Polly Toynbee and David Walker will be online today at 2pm on the Guardian network to discuss their book.
