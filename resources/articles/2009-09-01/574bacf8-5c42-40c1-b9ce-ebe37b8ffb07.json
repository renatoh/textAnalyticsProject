Matt Prior, Graham Onions and Graeme Swann are the new names among the 11 awarded central contacts for the next 12 months while Michael Vaughan, Steve Harmison, Monty Panesar and Andrew Flintoff have dropped off the list \u2013 though the injured Flintoff has been given an increment contract, a retainer that allows the ECB to top up his Lancashire salary. Flower said yesterday that the IPL, scheduled for next March and April, would still be a factor. \"The IPL might be an issue over the next few years,\" he said. \"We all know what the schedules and the workloads are like.\" Before the current season England's two most important players, Kevin Pietersen and Flintoff, returned from the IPL injured and the all-rounder has since announced his retirement from Test cricket. Current England players will be available for three weeks at next year's IPL. Flintoff is in a situation where he could be rested for next year's tour of Bangladesh and then go to the IPL. \"We wouldn't welcome a situation like that,\" said Flower. Speaking in support of central contacts, which were introduced in 2002-03, he said: \"To manage people's workloads, and have the option to do that, is important.\" But, he added: \"The IPL muddies the waters a bit.\" Regarding Flintoff, Flower said: \"First up I would like to see him fit again because we don't know how long that is going to take. I don't think there are going to be huge negotiations over what type of games he plays. Fred will be available for one-day international and Twenty20 cricket for England. Simple as that.\" Flintoff did not qualify for a central contract because he has retired from Test cricket but the national selector, Geoff Miller, said yesterday: \"The decision to award Andrew a contract reflects our view that he will still have an important role to play in our one-day side and we wish him well with his rehabilitation from injury. He remains a world-class talent.\" Vaughan, like Flintoff, has retired but there is no room for Harmison and Panesar on the central of increment list. Flower said: \"These are always important decisions because they are about people's careers, so you don't take them lightly. Central contracts and selection are very separate issues. There must be a correlation. We would be stupid to give someone a central contract and not play them but we can't be restricted selection\u2011wise by who is given a central contract. We will select sides to win games for England.\" Meanwhile, in a significant development, England have decided to rest Paul Collingwood and Jimmy Anderson from forthcoming matches in the current NatWest Series against Australia \u2013 the fourth match takes place here tomorrow with England trailing 3-0. Collingwood will miss the next three games and Anderson the next two in a move that is likely to be repeated exponentially through the hectically scheduled years ahead. \"With the schedules we have to do this, otherwise we will burn out,\" said Flower. \"I think it is an exciting opportunity for a couple of other guys to step into those roles and do them well.\" Ricky Ponting, the Australia captain who will return to the side today, recognised the problem when he said: \"Seven consecutive games in one series is a lot. There's not much we can do as players, we've just got to find the best way of getting ourselves up and motivating ourselves to play the same side over and over.\" England have been outplayed in this series and Flower admitted that England had not been good at one-day cricket since 1992, when they reached the World Cup final.\"At the moment our one-day cricket is very ordinary. Yes, we have plans and theories on how to play one-day cricket and they aren't working at the moment, certainly on the batting side of things. We are investing a lot of time and thought into why one-day cricket in England isn't as good as it should be, and hasn't been for a long time. And how we are going to build a good one-day side.\" Lord's teams: England (from) Strauss (capt), Denly, Bopara, Prior (wkt), Morgan, Shah, Wright, Rashid, Bresnan, Swann, Sidebottom, Broad, Onions. Australia (from) Ponting (capt), Watson, Paine (wkt), White, Clarke, Ferguson, Hussey, Hopes, Johnson, Lee, Hauritz, Bracken, Voges, Siddle, Hilfenhaus."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
