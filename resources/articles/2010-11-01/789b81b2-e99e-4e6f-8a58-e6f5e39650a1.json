Fuck it, let's rock'n'roll!\" So begins an awesome evening with New Jersey's increasingly buzzy band, who don't play gigs so much as detonate explosions of passion, mayhem, flailing bodies and hair. Stickles jolts so furiously you fear for his dental work, while guitarist (and violinist) Amy Klein never stops grinning and punching the air. Bruce Springsteen \u2013 acknowledged in the line, \"Tramps like us, baby we were born to die\" \u2013 is clearly an influence, but they emerge like an amalgam of the Clash, the Pogues, Jerry Lee Lewis, and, with Eric Harm's military drumming playing a pivotal role, a lost musical quintet returning after a bloody conflict, with tunes to die for. Titus are touring their remarkable concept album, The Monitor, about the American civil war, and they generate such an aura of a band at battle with everything \u2013 including themselves \u2013 you half expect smoke and flames to hit the stage. \"After 10,000 years, it's still us against them and my heroes have always died at the end,\" cries Stickles in Four Score and Seven. The stars and stripes hang forlornly from his guitar, while Stickles's bloodied anthems expose the divisions, contradictions and broken hearts within the American dream. In his songs' epic personal battles, there are only losers and yet they are delivered with such mellifluous intensity that it's impossible not to be uplifted. By the end, both band and audience are a mass of gleeful, riotous dancing: an appropriate reaction to Titus's purgative, redemptive, unifying, life-affirming noise.
