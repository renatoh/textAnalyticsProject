She has been running more than 100 miles a week, with a lowest of 134 and a high of 140, all at the lung-bursting altitude of Font Romeau in the French Pyrenees. The 28-year-old has also submitted herself to at least two hours of treatment a day from her physical therapist Gerhard Hartmann to ensure she avoids injury. It is a regime she has followed for many years with increasingly successful results. \"The one thing Paula has always done well is preparation,\" said Steve Cram, a former world mile record holder who is here for BBC television. \"She is meticulous. It's the attention to detail that counts. In a marathon you only have one or two chances a year to get it right and she maximises those opportunities.\" Even arguably the greatest distance runner in history is full of admiration for how Radcliffe prepares. \"She's so professional,\" said Paul Tergat, Kenya's five-time world cross-country champion. \"Even when she was getting beaten and lost out on major medals on the track you knew she had given every ounce of energy. Watching her run makes me feel so good.\" Glenn Latimer, the elite athletes race co-ordinator in Chicago, added: \"Everything she does, she does right. She sets goals and does everything to achieve them.\" Competition This is one of the deepest fields ever assembled for a women's race and is the first time for nearly 20 years that the two fastest women - Radcliffe and Kenya's world record-holder Catherine Ndereba - have met in a race outside major championships. Crucially, unlike other major events, this will be a mixed race, so Radcliffe can use the men to help pace her. The use of male pacemakers is a controversial issue. The London Marathon, which Radcliffe won in 2hr 18min 56sec in April, set its elite female competitors off 30 minutes before the men to ensure they do not receive any help. But Ndereba was given assistance from men last year when she ran her world record here. \"There will be plenty of men alongside the leading women and this will help them and offer shelter,\" said Tergat. \"I expect Paula to charge off and keep going as usual. But there will always be a man next to her, encouraging her.\" It will be a novel experience for Radcliffe to have any sort of company in a road race as she usually blasts off from the gun and is rarely headed. \"Even in mixed races I've found myself on my own,\" she said. \"It's OK if I'm running with someone who is doing an even pace but it could be difficult if they are not running consistently.\" The prospect is the pace will be so punishing in the closing miles it is unlikely many men will be able to keep up with her anyway. Latimer said: \"I think she'll blow everyone's doors off. It is hard to hold on when Paula is grinding out the pace she can.\" The course In contrast to London, which is a notoriously difficult course with its many turns and infamous cobbles at the Tower, Chicago is designed specifically for fast times. \"People think London is a fast course,\" said Britain's Paul Evans, a winner here in 1996. \"This is as flat as a pancake and even quicker. Paula will put the record to bed and I wouldn't be surprised if she ran 2:15 or even a lot faster. This course is at least 1 minutes faster than London. Only the weather can stop her.\" After a week of ideal temperatures, the forecast promises a drop of 30 degrees with rain and strong winds. Organisers are praying that the forecasters have got it wrong. \"It isn't good,\" said Radcliffe. \"Strong wind and rain doesn't suit me because I like to run fast.\" Unlike London, however, Chicago offers more protection from the wind. \"It won't be as bad as you think,\" said Karey Pinkowski, the race director. \"There are so many tall buildings here in Chicago that much of the route is very well sheltered.\" Radcliffe has not focused too much on the weather, preferring to concentrate on the things she can control. She has spent much of her week watching videos of past Chicago races to familiarise herself with the course. \"The weather matters less to Paula than anyone else,\" said Latimer. \"She's as tough as nails. The marathon suits her gutsy, strong character.\" Financial Radcliffe is among the least money-motivated athletes on the circuit but the riches awaiting her at the finish line if she adds the world record to her other triumphs, which include the world cross-country title and the Commonwealth Games 5,000m, are huge. The winner receives $100,000 (\u00a364,000) and $150,000 plus a Volkswagen worth $30,000 if she sets a world record. That would eclipse even the $225,000 she earned for that victory in London, when she recorded a time only nine seconds outside Ndereba's world record. Radcliffe has already been paid a reported $250,000 just to run here and another good performance will earn her a $250,000 bonus from her sponsors Nike. If she does achieve the world record, the London Marathon race director David Bedford may as well sign a cheque and hand it to her to fill in the details if he wants her to run in his race again next April. Even for Radcliffe, who, if she is not already, can expect to be a millionairess by the end of the year, that is a powerful incentive."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
