If Monty blew a lead in the first round of foursomes, he protected two advantages yesterday. The giants strutted their stuff but never outstripped the other performers at the Belfry. This was a day of rare drama, of humour in the shape of Lee Westwood and Sergio Garcia for most of the day, and of slight ill-humour from the same pair at the death. When Westwood missed a putt on the 18th to halve their final match, the Americans poured forth to acclaim their conquerors, Woods and Davis Love III. Garcia reacted angrily. It was nothing but a flicker of the American invasion of Brookline three years ago, and Garcia's angry gestures may have been more a sign of frustration at losing for the first time in four outings. Frustration, too, that with only the singles to come, there is no daylight between the teams. The Americans love Sunday singles. This was a day of rookies and old heads, of players out of form rediscovering their touch and of losing it again in some cases. Phillip Price and Pierre Fulke in the morning, then Jesper Parnevik in the afternoon, flickered briefly and faded. Colin Montgomerie, with his bad back and slim trim, was awesome from start to finish. Westwood and Garcia provided entertainment across the long day. They never seemed to have any sort of tight grip on their match against Stewart Cink and Jim Furyk, and only managed a pair of birdies, at the 5th and 8th. But having halved the first three holes they were never anything but in the lead. On the back nine the Americans holed nothing. Five bogeys in total and a solitary birdie made life rather less onerous for the unlikely circus-combination of Worksop and Castellon. The chemistry of the Ryder Cup, like the traffic strategy of the Warwickshire Police, is full of mystery. Just when the Americans might have been growing weary of playing patsy to the clowns, along came something entirely more serious in the shape of Colin Montgomerie and Bernhard Langer. The elder statesmen of the European team had blown a three-hole lead on Friday and they were in no mood for a repeat. When the older of the Scotts, the 46-year old Hoch to the 38-year old Verplank, left his 12ft birdie putt at the10th short, Monty rattled his eight-footer in and Europe were two up. There was to be no, repeat no, repeat. Except that at the very next hole Verplank sank a 40-footer. And Monty missed a tricky chip at the 15th. And the match was all-square with three to play. Then two. At the par-five 17th, Langer put Montgomerie to within six feet for three, and the birdie putt was dispatched. The Scotts could only manage par. And so, for only the first time in the morning session, play went up the 18th. Nervelessly they drove off, Monty and Scott the Elder, to position A. Bernhard and Junior moved a bit further down the alphabet with their seconds, leaving a long putt and a delicate chip for their respective partners. Monty sent his putt up the tiers and it finished stone dead. Hoch did not hole the chip. There was no repeat of Friday. The last foursome did not get near the 18th. Darren Clarke and Thomas Bj\u00f6rn never really gelled, and at 11.57 Tiger Woods notched up his first 2002 Ryder Cup point. Not much else to report there, really, except that at the 9th the Europeans made the great one putt a two-and-a-half-footer. Just to see if young Tiger really was displaying the first signs of the yips. Tiger obliged by putting Friday's double flop well behind him. He holed the tiddler, acknowledged his tormentors with a grin and sank another at the 15th to seal a comprehensive win. Something changed in the non-existent lunch-break between the foursomes and the fourballs. Montgomerie and Langer were still playing the 18th when Niclas Fasth and Jesper Parnevik set off down the 1st against Mark Calcavecchia and David Duval. Perhaps it was simply that there were more balls in play, but all the individual tales of the morning melted into a blur. More balls, more birdies, more roars, more collective buzz. Perhaps it was because Europe began to paint the scoreboard red. Parnevik, the supposed lame-duck, found himself three up after seven, he and his fellow Swede sharing four birdies. Monty was off again, this time alongside Padraig Harrington. They too went three up, after just four holes. Darren Clarke and Paul McGinley, in the last game against Scott Hoch and Jim Furyk, also took a lead, a slender one-hole advantage, gained on the third. Only the third game was going America's way. Tiger and Davis Love III met Westwood and Garcia and played killjoy. Woods birdied three of the first six holes and it was everything Westwood could do to prevent the lead growing to more than one hole. From around 3 o'clock, the European rush in the other games faltered. Phil Mickelson came to life and pinched two holes back. Hoch put together a string of three birdies and took the lead from the Irish. Furyk birdied the 13th to extend that lead to two holes. Calcavecchia and Duval clawed their way back to all-square, Duval driving the 10th for a three, Calcavecchia birdying 12 and 13, Duval 14. It was a surge that should have seen off the Swedes but they rallied and it took the impassive Duval to slam the door for the last time in their faces on the final green. If the new trend was American revival Westwood and Garcia inevitably bucked it. Garcia hit a second at the 8th to nine inches. Montgomerie and Harrington, too, refused to budge. Or rather, Montgomerie on his own refused to budge. Could Westwood and Garcia keep their act together? At the 10th they both pulled out their drivers and found the green. Love and even Woods played safe, laying up with irons and genially booed by the spectators. The Euro gamble paid off. Westwood's birdie started a bobbing motion between all-square and one-up as the European fought to hold off Woods, now with five birdies to his name. Three on the bounce by Westwood were exceptional, given the tension; a missed putt by Garcia on the 17th, which meant they were level going up the last, was a sure sign of how taut it was out there. On the final green, the whole afternoon's work shrank to Westwood's four-foot putt for a par and a half. It rolled clear of the hole on the left. Westwood and Garcia had lost their first match, while Woods had picked up his second point of the day. The Americans flocked on to the green and Garcia looked like mounting a one-man counterattack, but was persuaded to settle into the arms of his family If that was close to a brawl, nothing was harder fought than the McGinley-Clarke v Hoch-Furyk affair over the closing holes. McGinley birdied the 16th to level the match. The Americans won the 17th, Europe the last. Match halved, 8-all overall. So many scares, so much tension, everything so closely contested. And all nothing but a precursor to today's play when matters will be settled. Europe, like the traffic at The Belfry, have failed to move clear on the days suited to their collective spirit. They may be about to be clamped in the singles that suit America."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
