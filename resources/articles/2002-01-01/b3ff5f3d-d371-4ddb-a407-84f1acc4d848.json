In 104 years the Exiles have never produced a full England international and, when Declan Danaher, the man poised to break the mould, unwisely arrived in his new England training gear this week, it was as if he had set fire to the president's trousers. Predictably the 22-year-old Danaher has also been the recipient of serious stick from his team-mates, many of whom now address him as \"Deckers\" or \"Danners, old boy\" in mock deference to the Twickers of fond clich\u00e9. Over in Ireland they simply gazed down Clive Woodward's Six Nations squad list last week, paused at Danaher's name and wondered, in the name of Kerry, why a nice Irish lad would go and do something daft like that. If England already had, say, a Luigi Dallaglio rather than a Lawrence, life might have been easier. Instead, not for the first time, Danaher has had to spend long hours explaining why, as a born-and-bred Londoner playing for a cosmopolitan club, his first name should not be such a big deal. \"If I was called George no one would say anything,\" he shrugged this week, his mud-covered knees a reminder that tomorrow's Powergen Cup quarter-final against Gloucester is a far greater priority. He has a fair point but, name aside, the raw-boned, long-chinned, charmingly unspoilt Danaher is much more than another identikit professional off an English back-row conveyor belt which, with Joe Worsley, Lewis Moody, Alex Sanderson and Gloucester's Jamie Forrester pushing the old lags, is in danger of over-production. This is a young man who, instead of excelling at mini- rugby from the age of five, had barely picked up an oval ball until he was 14 - he preferred soccer and gaelic - and had a failed trial for Queens Park Rangers. He was playing at centre-back alongside Gifton Noel-Williams, now a Watford striker, on Hackney Marshes when his younger brother suggested a trial for one of Ruislip RFC's age-group sides. Before long he had been picked for Irish Exiles and, having represented Ireland in the Under-19 World Cup in Wales, seemed destined to end up in green until the Ireland Under-21 selectors unceremoniously ditched him. \"Dick Best was here at the time and kept saying 'Why didn't you get picked? Why didn't you get picked? Phone 'em up.' So I did. They said I was unfit and too nice.\" The man he holds chiefly to blame is the former Ireland and Lions captain Ciaran Fitzgerald. \"If people want an answer to why I'm not playing for Ireland, ask him,\" said Danaher flatly. \"It all got out of hand, with people saying Besty had poached me for England, but it was my own decision. People can't make my own mind up for me.\" Wherever he goes, though, the Irish question is never far away, even though his father Tim, a flooring sub-contractor, and mother Eileen, both from Munster farming stock, came over more than 25 years ago. \"I love Ireland and all my cousins in Munster but I think of myself as British. I'm neither Irish nor English. I go back to Ireland and people say 'Oh, you're Irish, you should play for us.' But I'm not. Even my old man used to call me a 'plastic Paddy'. He was only winding me up but, you know, at the end of the day that's what I am.\" Even so as recently as last month the new Ireland coach Eddie O'Sullivan was over watching him and making conciliatory noises. It was too late. \"Clive has really been interested,\" said Brendan Venter, Irish's player-coach. \"He's been on our case, inviting him to training sessions because they know what Dec can do week in, week out.\" In Venter's eyes Danaher has done absolutely the right thing. \"If you can get into the England set-up, one of the top three sides in the world, I'd go for them.\" Woodward confessed last week to being \"really excited\" about his new selection, while the Exiles' Ireland flanker Kieron Dawson reckons \"he is ready for Test rugby now\" despite having played only 38 club games. Venter cannot speak highly enough of his work-rate, his natural ability, his versatility or the keenness of his brain. \"He's also a nice guy, which makes a big difference because being a team player is a big factor nowadays. If you just think you're talented it's not going to be enough.\" Too nice? It is always an unconvincing label but so self-effacing is the former City University civil engineering student that, when newspapers published the development squad member Kevin Brennan's mugshot to illustrate Danaher's call-up last week, few outside his club even noticed. There are times when his inexperience still shows - he had a self-confessed \"mare\" against Northampton recently after trying to outmuscle Andrew Blowers and Budge Pountney - and he is using acupuncture to ease the strain on his lean frame, his shoulders in particular. His ego, too, is woefully undernourished. He does not, he said, come out very well in photographs and was almost embarrassed to speculate on what his rugby future might hold. \"I don't even want to think about it. It's easier that way.\" Much the same breezy logic exists at Irish, where the aim is to qualify for Europe next season by any available route. The laughter coming from the mid-pitch huddle is genuine and unforced and, when it is all over, Venter drives off in a Fiat Uno roughly the same size, not to say battered shape, as the club's tight-head prop Rob Hardwick. Danaher himself cannot yet drive, so travels everywhere by train. The Danaher family sound like characters, too. \"Dad gets so excited when he's watching me play that my mother can't sit next to him. She's pretty bad herself. I pick up quite a few knocks and there's always tears that I'm dead or something.\" This Declan Danaher is a nice guy.
