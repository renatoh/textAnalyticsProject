The report by the Independent Monitoring Commission (IMC) also said security sources claimed that some IRA members still had access to firearms. A statement issued later by the IRA claimed that allegations the group was in \"breach of its public commitments\" over disarmament were false and \"politically motivated\". The IMC claims about weapons opened up a row with the body responsible for overseeing the IRA's decommissioning of weapons, the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD). One of the IMC commissioners said they had less confidence than General John de Chastelain's IICD over the IRA's promises on arms. In its conclusion, the IMC said the IRA was in a period of evolution but some members continued to be involved in assaults and organised crime, including money laundering and smuggling. It said there was no evidence, however, to suggest the IRA leadership had made any change to its strategic decision to end its armed struggle, which was announced on July 28 last year. The government pointed to the positive aspects of the report, which is sure to fuel unionist resistance to forming a power-sharing government with Sinn F\u00e9in at some stage this year. Talks aimed at reviving the Stormont assembly, which was suspended in October 2002 amid allegations of an IRA spying ring, are due to start on Monday. The Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, suggested today's report had vindicated the misgivings his party had over the IRA. Mr Paisley asked Tony Blair at prime minister's questions whether he was alarmed that the commission was now \"admitting there were perhaps misjudgments\" about earlier assessments of the IRA. Mr Blair said that although concerns about violence and criminality remained, \"it would be quite wrong to say there has not been any significant progress\". The IMC monitors paramilitary activity and delivers reports every three months to the British and Irish governments. The last report in October came just a month after the IICD said the IRA had disarmed. Commissioners said at the time that it was too early to assess the group's commitment to a peaceful transformation. Today's report said the IRA was in a period of change and, while some signs were \"disturbing\" and others were \"at best neutral\", it concluded that most indicators suggested it was evolving in a \"positive direction\". However, there were several strands in the report that will fuel unionist scepticism about the IRA's promises, including the new claims on the bitterly divisive issue of arms decommissioning. Monitors clash The IMC report said security sources had told the four-member commission that some handguns had allegedly been retained by a number of IRA members for personal protection and \"area defence\". The IICD said, however, that it had tried and failed to corroborate the claims about the handguns with the police in the Irish Republic. The IICD said it had met two IRA representatives last week who had insisted no weapons had been retained. Gen de Chastelain said there was no indication that a substantial number of weapons were involved or that the IRA leadership knew if members had retained them. However, IMC commissioner Lord Alderdice said they had received a number of \"credible reports\" about access to weapons. \"The level of confidence which he's [the general] expressed ... is not a level of confidence about full decommissioning that we are in a position to share.\" Commentators said the row was likely to compound an existing rift between police in Belfast and the Northern Ireland Office over assessments of IRA crime levels. Intelligence gathering The IMC's claim that the IRA continues to gather intelligence may have the most significant bearing on next week's talks about resuming power-sharing, given that the collapse of the assembly was prompted by a spying row. In today's report, the IMC said the IRA continued to gather information on individuals and groups, including members of the security forces, and had \"no intention\" of stopping. The commission said the spying was \"authorised by the leadership\" and \"involved several senior members\". The IMC added, however, that the purpose of the intelligence did not appear to be to plan terrorist attacks. The report said: \"We do not think that the [Provisional] PIRA leadership believes that terrorism has a part in this political strategy.\" The commission said the IRA appeared to be restructuring and there was no evidence of any recruitment, or training. However, there was evidence of continuing criminality and senior members of the organisation were accused of laundering money, with the proceeds of crime being used to buy property or legitimate businesses. IRA money laundering is being investigated by around 100 detectives in the Irish Republic. The IRA has been accused of trying to launder money that the British and Irish governments allege it stole in the \u00a326.5m Northern Bank robbery in Belfast in December 2004. The report said a number of IRA units were closing down criminal operations and clearing their stocks of contraband, the IMC said. However, some members and former members continued to be heavily involved in organised crime, including tobacco and fuel smuggling, the commission said. Commissioners said smaller dissident republican groups, such as the Continuity IRA and the Real IRA, have been responsible for hoax devices targeting the police or military. These groups continued to use violence to impose discipline and exert control within local communities. The Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Hain, said he was cautiously optimistic after reading the IMC report, adding that the IRA was \"going in the right direction\". \"There are no murders. There is no recruitment. There's no bank robberies,\" he said. Loyalist paramilitaries The IMC said loyalist gangs also continued to engage in paramilitary activity and in crimes such as shootings, drug dealing, extortion and money laundering. However, it added that last summer's feud between two loyalist groups had come to an end. The report accused the Ulster Defence Association of gunning down one of its former brigadiers, Jim Gray, in east Belfast on October 4 last year. The IMC said the picture of the UDA since October last year was \"essentially the same\" despite the group signalling in November last year that it wanted to talk to the government about its future. When talks about power-sharing begin next week, the Democratic Unionists, Northern Ireland's largest party, are expected to press London and Dublin to accept its plan for phased devolution. Sinn F\u00e9in demands that full devolution be restored, which it says is a required part of the implementation of the Good Friday agreement. The IMC was established by the British and Irish governments in January 2004 to monitor the activities of paramilitary organisations and assess progress in \"normalising security\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
