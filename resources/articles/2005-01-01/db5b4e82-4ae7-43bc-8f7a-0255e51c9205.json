The California-based Simon Wiesenthal Centre, one of the largest international Jewish human rights organisations, said the prince should attend a ceremony being held at the death camp later this month to mark the 60th anniversary of its liberation. A photograph splashed across the front page of the Sun showed Prince Harry enjoying a drink and a cigarette while dressed as a member of Rommel's Afrika Corps, complete with red swastika armband. The Simon Wiesenthal Centre's strongly-worded rebuke said that, in Auschwitz, the prince would see the results \"of the hated symbol he so foolishly and brazenly chose to wear\" at the party. \"This was a shameful act, displaying insensitivity for the victims,\" a statement said. \"Not just for those soldiers of his own country who gave their lives to defeat Nazism, but to the victims of the Holocaust who were the principal victims of the Nazis.\" A royal official today said he understood the calls for the prince to go to Auschwitz but that there were no plans for him to attend any of the ceremonies. \"It would be a distraction and a detraction from the importance of the occasion because it would become a different story in media terms,\" the spokesman told Reuters. \"He recognises he made a very bad mistake and he apologises for that. There are no plans for him to say anything more.\" A statement from Prince Harry was released by Clarence House late last night, in which he apologised for any offence caused. However, the Tory leader, Michael Howard, who has spoken of how his paternal grandmother died at Auschwitz, today said he believed the prince should say sorry in person. \"I think a lot of people will be disappointed to see that photograph, and it will cause a lot of offence,\" Mr Howard told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"I have no doubt that his father and his family will have a good deal to say to him in private. I think it might be appropriate for him to tell us himself just how contrite he now is.\" That call was rejected by Tony Blair, who said: \"Prince Harry has made it clear he is very sorry about it and I think the rest of it is best to leave to Buckingham Palace.\" Rabbi Dr Jonathan Romain, a spokesman for the Reform Synagogues of Great Britain, agreed, saying: \"The fact that the palace has issued an apology indicates that this was a mistake by the prince. But having being given, the apology should now be accepted.\" The \"native and colonial\" themed party, held at the country mansion of the Olympic showjumper Richard Meade, who is the father of a friend of princes William and Harry, was attended by 250 people. Prince William dressed as a big cat in a leopardskin leotard with matching tail and paws. The Labour backbencher and former armed forces minister Doug Henderson said the incident at the party had shown that Prince Harry was unfit to train as an army officer at Sandhurst. \"If it had been a sort of Freddie Starr satirical take-off of what happened during the second world war, then I think people would understand. It might not have been very clever, but it wouldn't be malicious in any way,\" he said. \"But from what I can gather, there is no suggestion that that is the case. It is a straightforward Nazi armband, and I think that would offend an awful lot of people who fought in the second world war and relatives who lost people in that war. I really think it disqualifies Prince Harry from Sandhurst.\" However, Colonel Bob Stewart, who led British UN troops in Bosnia, said: \"He's made a serious error, but it's not an error that should stop him entering officer training.\" Adding that the prince \"must be an enormous idiot with minimum common sense\", Col Stewart said: \"If I had an officer who went to a party dressed as a Nazi, I would have dragged him in front of me and, as his commanding officer, would have given him a punishment of 14 days extra duties.\" Lord Janner, the chairman of the Holocaust Educational Trust, agreed that the episode should not preclude the prince from going to Sandhurst. \"I would send him in the army as fast as possible. I hope that would teach him not to behave like that,\" he told the ITV News Channel. \"What Harry did was both stupid and evil. The time has come for him to make a public apology. It is about common decency, of respect to the people who fought the Nazis, to the families of those who were killed by the Nazis and to people who suffered during the Holocaust.\" Dicky Arbiter, a former royal press spokesman, said he felt sorry for the Prince of Wales. \"Once again, he has been let down by his wayward son. Every time there is some good, there is lots of bad. And it can't go on,\" Mr Arbiter told the Today programme. \"If he now wants to be considered an adult, he has got to behave like an adult, and he has got to apologise in person, through radio and television. It is just not good enough to behave like that. We all know history, and at 20 there is no excuse.\" Andy Pike, of Unite Against Fascism, called for the third in line to the throne to do more than apologise, and \"distance\" himself from the Nazis. \"We don't think that [an apology] is enough. We would like to see Harry distance himself from Nazi ideas of white supremacy, anti-semitism and racism, because he is a very influential figure.\" The Queen is to commemorate the Holocaust and 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz by inviting the survivors of the Nazi death camps and the British veterans who liberated them to a reception at St James's Palace. With the Duke of Edinburgh, she will also attend the Holocaust Memorial Day national commemoration at Westminster Hall, in London, on January 27."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
