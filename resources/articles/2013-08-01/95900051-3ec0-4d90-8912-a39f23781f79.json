The award for funniest Joke of the Edinburgh festival fringe, of course. The comedian Rob Auton, 30, has seen off competition from acclaimed pun-slingers including Tim Vine and Gary Delaney to pick up TV channel Dave's annual award for one-liners at the fringe. His award-winning gag was: \"I heard a rumour that Cadbury is bringing out an oriental chocolate bar. Could be a Chinese Wispa.\" The line narrowly edged out an Alex Horne wisecrack: \"I used to work in a shoe-recycling shop. It was sole-destroying.\" Alfie Moore came third with: \"I'm in a same-sex marriage \u2026 the sex is always the same.\" Other comedians on the shortlist included Marcus Brigstocke, Chris Coltrane and Phil Wang. No female comics made the 10-strong list. Auton, who has been performing since 2008, is not a well-known name in Edinburgh: his set, The Sky Show , is part of the independent Free fringe programme, in which comedians use performance spaces without a venue charge, and audiences are invited to contribute instead of paying upfront for tickets. He only recently quit his job, selling paintbrushes in Soho, to work on comedy full time. He becomes the sixth winner of the award, succeeding the Canadian comic Stewart Francis. Previous winners include Vine, Nick Helm and Zoe Lyons. Tim Vine came in fourth with: \"My friend told me he was going to a fancy dress party as an Italian island. I said to him, 'Don't be Sicily.'\" Gary Delaney was fifth \u2013 \"I can give you the cause of anaphylactic shock in a nutshell.\" Auton said: \"I am honoured to receive this award, and just pleased that a joke that tackles the serious issue of the invention of a new chocolate bar can be laughed at by the people of Britain.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
