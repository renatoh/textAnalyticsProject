Ballesteros routinely wore navy and white clothing in the final round of major tournaments. It was as a player and captain in the Ryder Cup, however, that the golfing legend displayed most passion; this weekend represents the first staging of the event since Ballesteros died last year. Paul Lawrie, who will be part of this week's Europe side against the US, said: \"I don't know for sure but the word is that we're wearing navy trousers, navy sweaters and white shirts like Seve always wore in the final round of majors. I think that will be our singles outfit. \"I don't know that for certain but a few of the boys have mentioned that and I think that, if that is indeed the case, there could be no more fitting a tribute to a guy like Seve than having 12 of the best players in Europe wearing his outfit on the final day of the Ryder Cup. \"If that's how they're going to do it, then it's absolutely bang on.\" Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal declined to confirm what plans are in place to commemorate his fellow Spaniard. \"Well, I don't know if I should answer that question,\" said Olaz\u00e1bal, who was a close friend of Ballesteros, of the blue and white suggestion. \"You know, Seve is going to be there in our team in some way or form. \"I have to say in that regard that I talked to Davis regarding that question, that first question and he was very understanding of it, and I'll say no more at the moment.\" Olaz\u00e1bal was more expansive when recalling the assistance offered to him by Ballesteros at the 1987 Ryder Cup. Olaz\u00e1bal and Love were speaking on Monday afternoon on their arrival at Medinah. \"I was a rookie in '87 at Muirfield Village and he [Ballesteros] took me under his wing,\" said Olazabal. \"He made clear to Tony Jacklin that he wanted to play with me. I will never forget that little walk from the putting green to the first tee. I was shaking like a leaf. \"You know, it was huge crowds, very loud, similar to what we are going to see here this week. So I kept my head down, and he approached me as we were walking on to the first tee. \"He looked at me, and said, 'Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda, you play your game, I'll take care of the rest.' And he did. \"He was a great figure I think not just for myself but for the whole European squad, not just that year but every year that he played in that team. We are going to miss him a lot. It's going to be actually the first time that he's not going to be with us. He was a special man.\" In what promises to be a colourful Sunday scene the USPGA has encouraged home supporters to turn up at Medinah wearing red. On the prospect of a raucous atmosphere Love said: \"It's very, very intense. It's almost unfair to the players but I think these guys love the challenge of that and to see how they can react under that kind of pressure. \"It's an incredible, big golf course and a big stage and I think the first tee could be the loudest any of these guys have ever seen to start off a golf tournament. \"So I expect a lot of passion. I expect if we are winning holes it's going to get pretty loud out there and that's what the home-field advantage is all about. \"That's what you prepare these guys for. You have to tell them, 'Hey, this is going to be something like you've never seen before.' \"And we both know. We know what the good cheers sound like and what the bad cheers sound like. We'll try to get them going loud in our favour.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
