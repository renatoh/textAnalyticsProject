Sturridge scored the second goal in Liverpool\u2019s convincing 3-0 win over Villarreal and was closely involved in the other two, but it was not only his finishing that caught the eye. The England striker put in a superb all-round performance after being kept out of the team in recent weeks, and either by accident or design Klopp appears to have worked out how to bring the best from him. \u201cDaniel had a great game. When he is fit he is an unbelievable player,\u201d the Liverpool manager said. \u201cHe was outstanding for us but even he needs the other players alongside him to play well too. That is what happened tonight, the performance exceeded all my expectations. I have no words to describe it, particularly the power we showed in the first half. It was nice to watch, great to be a part of a night like that. \u201cAt half time I told the players to keep going with the emotional football but maybe use their brains a bit more. I wanted my players to be both emotional and smart, if that makes any sense, and they were.\u201d Liverpool had other excellent performers in James Milner and Roberto Firmino, though it was the manager\u2019s name the supporters were chanting at the end. \u201cMaybe when I am 50 I will get to like that,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cUntil then the fans do not have to sing my name. I am just part of the team, we are all parts of the same team. It was a brilliant display from my boys.\u201d The Villarreal coach, Marcelino, accepted Liverpool had been the better side and deserved to go through, though he felt their intensity and physicality at times bordered on the illegal. \u201cThey pressed us so much it was hard for us to impose ourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cThe biggest difference between the two teams was Liverpool\u2019s intensity. They played with such a high tempo, and on the edge of the rules at times, but it was allowed. But they were better than us, I admit. Liverpool are a great side and we have been unlucky enough to catch them in their best moment of the season. There\u2019s not a lot more you can say.\u201d Sturridge, whose contribution surely answered any lingering questions Roy Hodgson might have had about taking him to France this summer, said he was thrilled to reach a final. \u201cWe had to work our socks off and that\u2019s what we did,\u201d he said. \u201cTonight was about soaking up the atmosphere and putting in a performance. It\u2019s a great feeling to get through to a final like that.\u201d Adam Lallana, scorer of the third goal to set up a meeting with Sevilla in Basel later this month, said if Liverpool could reproduce that level of performance they need not fear anyone. \u201cWe always knew Villarreal could have got the away goal and made things difficult but credit to the lads, they showed great guts,\u201d Lallana said. \u201cIt was a brilliant performance, we are reaping the rewards now for hard work earlier in the season. It\u2019s great to be in a final and we fancy ourselves against anyone if we play like that and press like that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
