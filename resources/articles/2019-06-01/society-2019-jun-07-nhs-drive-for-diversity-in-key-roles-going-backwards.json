The proportion of chairs and non-executive directors of NHS trusts in England who are from an ethnic minority has almost halved from 15% in 2010 to just 8%, research shows. The proportion of women in those posts has also fallen from 47% in 2002 to only 38%, despite a flurry of initiatives to improve female as well as BME representation in senior NHS roles. The findings are contained in a report by the NHS Confederation, which represents 85% of local health service bodies in England. \u201cThe progress and gains made in the early 2000s towards a more diverse board leadership in NHS trusts has gone into reverse or made no progress,\u201d the report said. \u201cAs a community of leaders, chairs and non-executive directors are often not representative of the communities they serve and the staff they govern.\u201d The 38% of chair and non-executive director roles filled by women is in stark contrast to the fact that overall 77% of the NHS\u2019s 1.3 million-strong workforce is female. Similarly, while just 8% of those posts are held by those from an ethnic minority, overall 19% of NHS personnel are from a BME background. Almost half of the 240 NHS trusts do not have even a single BME board member, according to separate NHS data collected to monitor progress against the service\u2019s workforce race equality standard. The declining number of people with a BME background in key positions is a setback for the NHS England chief executive, Simon Stevens. He has made improving BME representation a key priority during his five years in charge and warned of the dangers of NHS trusts failing to better reflect their local communities. The data shows that the NHS is failing to honour the spirit of laws designed to improve female and BME representation, according to the report, which says: \u201cEquality, diversity and inclusion is an area that the NHS needs to make significant progress in to reflect the spirit of the equality and diversity legislation and the NHS\u2019s stated ambition to create a more diverse leadership.\u201d Danielle Oum, the chair of Walsall Healthcare NHS trust and co-chair of the confederation\u2019s BME leadership network, said: \u201cDiversity on boards is important for diversity of thought and the avoidance of groupthink. It\u2019s particularly key for the NHS due to the make-up of its workforce and the population it serves.\u201d She warned that under-representation of both groups could become even worse in the next few years as a result of the ongoing structural upheaval that NHS England is overseeing as it creates a wave of new bodies called integrated care systems The disclosures raise further questions about the NHS\u2019s approach to equality. The service is already under pressure to eradicate the wide pay gaps that exist among its staff in both gender and race. The report blames the widening gaps in female and BME representation on the abolition in 2012 of the NHS Appointments Commission and the move, begun during Tony Blair\u2019s premiership, to allow some NHS trusts to become semi-independent foundation trusts. The Appointments Commission sought to ensure gender balance and better BME representation when selecting people for key roles. Selection now is done by trusts themselves, with input from the finance and governance regulator NHS Improvement. Foundation trusts appoint their own board members, in conjunction with their governors, but without any say from an independent agency. The confederation called for an urgent overhaul of the appointments procedures for such posts. However, \u201csignificant barriers\u201d in the way of progress include \u201cgroupthink\u201d decision-making by independent board advisers, governors and executive search companies and selection criteria valuing commercial and financial skills ahead of those needed to ensure the collaboration and transformation that the NHS plans, it added. NHS England highlighted that growing numbers of trusts have at least two BME board members. Boards include executive directors, which the confederation did not analyse, as well as non-executive directors. \u201cThe NHS long-term plan restated our commitment to making our boards and leadership more representative of the workforce and wider society,\u201d said Yvonne Coghill, its director of workforce race equality standard implementation. \u201cThanks to the workforce race equality standard programme we have seen a steady increase in the number of NHS trusts that have more than one BME board member, and a new model employer strategy is providing further intensive support to improve diversity at all levels of local NHS organisations.\u201d Joan Saddler, co-chair of the NHS equality and diversity council, said: \u201cThis report must be a wake-up call for a health service which is heading in the wrong direction and becoming less diverse at board level. That is not right for patients and staff working in NHS organisations.\u201d The NHS has pledged to tackle the under-representation of both groups since the 2000s, but progress has been limited or non-existent. For example, research in 2014 by Middlesex University academic Roger Kline about the NHS\u2019s \u201csnowy white peaks\u201d, found that the proportion of BME people on the boards of trusts in London was small at 8% and falling, despite the city\u2019s significant cultural diversity. NHS England\u2019s chair and vice-chair, who is also a non-executive director, are both white men. Three of its five other non-executive directors are women and two are men, one of whom is from an ethnic minority. Ifti Majid, chief executive of Derbyshire Healthcare trust, said: \u201cThe time for passively accepting inequality has long passed.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
