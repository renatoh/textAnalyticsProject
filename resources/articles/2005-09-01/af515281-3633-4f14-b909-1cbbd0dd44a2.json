The European commission has signalled approval of Saudi membership, though it needs the approval of EU member states. The system is expected to be operable in 2008. Agreements have been signed with China, Israel, Ukraine and India. Discussions are under way with Norway, Morocco, South Korea, Argentina, Russia, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Malaysia and Australia. Galileo will consist of 30 satellites primarily for civilian uses."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
