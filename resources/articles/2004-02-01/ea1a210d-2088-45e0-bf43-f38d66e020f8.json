After a deluge put paid to last night's match, the Football Association is considering relocating the tie to a neutral venue should Telford's Bucks Head pitch again be ruled unplayable because of waterlogging. The Conference side borrowed heated covers from the FA and spread 40 tons of sand in an attempt to render the pitch suitable for last night's scheduled match. However, given the recent downpours in the west Midlands, it was no great shock when a 1pm inspection determined that the fixture, which had already been postponed from January 24 because of a waterlogged pitch, would have to be rearranged for next Wednesday. There is a suggestion that a relocation would take the game to the nearby Premiership ground of Molineux, though the FA wants to honour Telford's home fixture if possible. \"We will closely monitor the state of the pitch between now and Wednesday, but we are considering other options to get the game played,\" said an FA spokesman. \"A change of venue is a possibility but we want to give Telford every chance to stage the game at home. Having said that, we need the game to be played before the fifth-round ties go ahead. We do not want fourth-round ties hanging over after that.\" The fifth round is scheduled for the weekend of February 14-15 but, should the Telford-Millwall match be drawn, there would be a replay and the winners' next Cup fixture - at home to Burnley - would probably have to be postponed to accommodate the delay. Telford have been able to play at home only once since December 13 - in a 2-0 FA Trophy win over Alfreton - and have been training at an Astroturf complex because their own training ground is also flooded."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
