Tottenham were passive visitors enjoying the autumn sunshine without driving forward and forcing passages of pressure. Their high line in the first half made the midfield competitive, with Danny Murphy and Didier Zokora coping with Mohamed Sissoko and Xabi Alonso. Ben\u00edtez's response was to urge a surge after half-time, upping the tempo. The Spaniard created a problem for Zokora and Murphy. By pushing Steven Gerrard more central, the hosts overloaded and nullified Tottenham's passing players. With Teemu Tainio adrift of the front and forced to play even more narrow by Gerrard's new positioning, Steve Finnan began to make inroads from the full-back position down the right. Playing well forward, he confronted Beno\u00eet Assou-Ekotto on several occasions and the Spurs player, who seems to be still adjusting to the pace of the Premiership, became very much a defence-minded full-back. As a consequence Zokora found it more difficult to intercept and win the ball. Mark Gonz\u00e1lez's pace on the left made Pascal Chimbonda defend rather than attack. Murphy had more shuttles to cope with and the wide midfielders, Jermaine Jenas and Tainio, were forced back, leaving Robbie Keane and Jermain Defoe more isolated. Edgar Davids for Tainio gave Spurs a chance of a left-footed delivery and more energy. When he followed his pass and ran behind the Liverpool defence, he was the only white-shirted midfielder to do so all game. His first touches looked perfect, and Spurs will claim that Jenas's miss was the defining moment. I doubt this. Sissoko and Alonso had generated a strong second-half effort and Gerrard's presence made theirs a threatening trio."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
