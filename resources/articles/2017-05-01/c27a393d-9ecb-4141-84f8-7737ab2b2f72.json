This time, Blackburn could win and still be relegated. On the other hand, depending on results elsewhere, a draw may keep them up. Mowbray\u2019s side are third from bottom, level on points with Forest, who are immediately above them with a goal difference superior by one. Birmingham are two points ahead. \u201cThere is even an outside chance that we might lose and stay up; that\u2019s how tight it is,\u201d Mowbray says. \u201cTheoretically we could get beat and our fans would be jumping around but it is much more likely that we will need to win by a certain number of goals. You can\u2019t leave these things to chance so if Forest are winning by a single goal, we\u2019ll need to be thinking about sending an extra striker on to try and get more. \u201cIf the other teams are losing and we are doing all right, I\u2019ll try and keep it tight. The worst-case scenario is if we hear Birmingham are winning four-nil and Forest have scored five because that would leave us needing about seven.\u201d The situation might not be quite so tense at the bottom but for the wholesale changes Huddersfield Town made at Birmingham last weekend, which allowed Harry Redknapp\u2019s team an unexpected three points. Like most managers, Mowbray can see both sides of the argument. \u201cI don\u2019t blame David Wagner for doing what he thinks is best for his side,\u201d he says. \u201cHuddersfield have done well to get to the play-offs and I think a lot of managers would do the same in his position. That doesn\u2019t make it any easier for us though. It must be some magic dust Harry brings with him for a team with only two wins in 23 games to suddenly be able to win 2-0 with 10 men.\u201d Mowbray arrived at Blackburn with 10 weeks remaining of the season and in 14 games has suffered only three defeats, though he freely admits there have not been enough victories. \u201cWhen you are at the bottom what you really need is a run of wins \u2013 that\u2019s the only thing that will catapult you up the table,\u201d he says. \u201cWinning boosts everyone\u2019s confidence but if you draw the next game it slips away and you are sucked back in.\u201d Blackburn have been in steady decline since the club\u2019s owners decided they could do without Sam Allardyce. Mowbray would not come in for particular criticism should the club find itself in League One and would be happy to stay on as manager, though with a sigh and an exasperated gesture towards the extremely well-appointed training facilities in view through the window, he points out what should be obvious. \u201cThis club has the infrastructure in place to be much bigger,\u201d he says. \u201cI am not saying we are too good for League One, Forest are double European Cup winners and they are in trouble too, but if reality hits, you have to look it in the eye. \u201cI know all about League One from when I was at Coventry. It\u2019s really tough going to places like Bury and Rochdale on a Tuesday night. Should the worst come to the worst, savings will have to be made, salaries will have to be reduced, but it would be a mistake to let all your quality go. You cannot dilute your playing strength too much or you will never get back. If we do find ourselves in League One we will obviously be on a reduced budget but I would still like to think it would be one of the bigger and better ones within that division.\u201d In the event of relegation, Mowbray will be making that point to the Venky\u2019s Group or its representatives. The manager has had little direct contact with the club\u2019s owners, though claims their hands-off style suits him. \u201cThe owners have been letting me get on with my job and that\u2019s how I think it should be,\u201d he explains. \u201cI am sure they are aware of our predicament but there\u2019s nothing they can do at this stage that will affect anything. We will all have to sit down at some point and work out a strategy for the future but at the moment we don\u2019t know what that future will involve. I\u2019m still hoping for the chance to start a Championship season on level points with everyone else. We\u2019ve got to be realistic, it might not happen, but we haven\u2019t played the last match yet and I\u2019m fairly confident we can get a result.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
