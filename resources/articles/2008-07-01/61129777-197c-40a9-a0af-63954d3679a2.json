In recent years, he has suffered a vocal cyst, survived the weirdly Meatish-sounding Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome and fended off accusations of onstage drunkenness. He looks ready to keel over after one number. Then again, Meat has spent the last 33 years looking ready to keel over. \"What else am I gonna go?\" he asked the Guardian recently, \"Run a hotdog stand?\" Even slimmed down, food dominates Meat's agenda. His Casa de Carne tour (Spanish for \"house of meat\") sounds like a suburban tapas bar. He envisaged a stately-home gig like this one would mean carnivorous feasting (\"like Henry VIII\"), so must be disappointed to see the crowd nibbling on grapes and a cheese board featuring, ludicrously, photographs of Meat. He abandons the mic to shout \"Stick that up your fucking ass\", having perhaps spied the couple sipping Veuve Clicquot. His fury may be theatre, but there is often a real undercurrent to the man whose girth was ridiculed at school and who now takes nightly revenge by having audiences eat - almost literally - out of his big hands. He holds a beer aloft (but noticeably does not drink it) to rage at \"teetotalers in England\". A recent show was criticised for sound problems, so he uses Life Is a Lemon and I Want My Money Back to ask \"Is that what you fucking want?\" There are no takers, because a furious Meat is weirdly compelling. Backed by an excellent band who all resemble Coronation Street's hapless rocker Vernon, he brings an operatic touch to I Would Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That) and roars through Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through like it is his last show ever. He even leads a comically aristocratic chorus of \"Fuck you\" towards whoever is responsible for the lack of video screens that would have made him larger than life. The visual spectacle is, unusually, minimal - he has left the inflatable bats at home - but as Bat Out of Hell starts, the heavens open, turning Castle Howard into Hades. Dramatically, a winged creature emerges from the downpour. Alas, Meat Loaf's powers do not extend to commanding nature. It is a sparrow. \u00b7 At the Motor Show Music festival, Excel, London on August 2. Box office: 0871 230 5593."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
