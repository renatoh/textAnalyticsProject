The eight-time NBA All-Star sent the tweets on Sunday in response to a fan who asked for \u201cone legitimate reason\u201d for Durant\u2019s decision to leave the Oklahoma City Thunder for the Warriors in July 2016. Writing in the third person, Durant responded by saying \u201che didn\u2019t like the organization or playing for Billy Donovan\u201d and that \u201chis roster wasn\u2019t that good, it was just him and [Russell Westbrook].\u201d Eagle-eyed users on the social networking platform quickly noticed the responses came from Durant\u2019s verified feed and not, as likely intended, from an anonymous burner account. \u201cI use Twitter to engage with fans,\u201d Durant said on Tuesday during a panel at the TechCrunch Disrupt event in San Francisco. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great way to engage with basketball fans. I happened to take it a little too far. That\u2019s what happens sometimes when I get into these basketball debates about what I really love, to play basketball. \u201cI don\u2019t regret clapping back at anybody or talking to my fans on Twitter. I do regret using my former coach\u2019s name and the former organization I played for. That was childish. That was idiotic, all those type of words. I apologize for that.\u201d Durant departed the Thunder in free agency after a season that saw Oklahoma City win 55 games and come with one win of the NBA finals only to surrender a three-games-to-one lead in their best-of-seven Western Conference finals series with the Warriors. After signing with Golden State in the offseason, Durant helped the Warriors to a second title in three years, capturing NBA finals Most Valuable Players honors. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll stop engaging with fans,\u201d said Durant, who stopped short of admitting he uses alternate Twitter accounts to discuss himself in the third person. \u201cI really enjoy it and it\u2019s a good way to connect us all, but I\u2019ll scale back a little bit right now and just focus on playing basketball. \u201cI\u2019ll move on from that; it was tough to deal with yesterday. I was pretty mad at myself. Definitely want to move on and keep playing basketball.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
