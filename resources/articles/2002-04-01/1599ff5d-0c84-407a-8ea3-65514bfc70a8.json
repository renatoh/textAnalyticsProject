Third-placed Cheltenham must go to the newly crowned champions Plymouth while Mansfield, two points behind, entertain Carlisle in their final games on Saturday. But, given the Robins' vastly superior goal difference, a point at Home Park will see them up. The Conference's top two both lost last night, the leaders Boston falling 2-0 at Scarborough while Dagenham &amp; Redbridge went down 1-0 at Hereford. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
