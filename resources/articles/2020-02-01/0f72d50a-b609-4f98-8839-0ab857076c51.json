Thanks for following. I\u2019ll leave you with Nick Ames\u2019s report from Carrow Road \u2026 While we wait to hear from the managers, here\u2019s something for Leicester fans to ponder More here from goalscorer Lewis, who thinks Norwich can still make it. \u201cWhen the season started we knew it would be a battle from the beginning but with the squad and togetherness we always thought we could push through and survive in this league.\u201d Norwich\u2019s flying fullbacks Jamal Lewis and Max Aarons have been revelling in their victory tonight. \u201cI cut across it and aimed for that spot,\u201d says Lewis of his goal, which came from an Aarons cross. \u201cThe finish wasn\u2019t a surpise for me, he works on it every day,\u201d adds Aarons. \u201cThis is massive for us. We will go to Sheffield United with all guns blazing.\u201d Leicester\u2019s poor run continues and that unexpected defeat means it\u2019s just one win in the last seven for them in the Premier League. Their top four spot is looking more precarious by the week but they still have quite a gap to defend so I\u2019m sure Brendan Rodgers won\u2019t be panicking just yet. That\u2019s Norwich\u2019s fifth win of the season and second clean sheet at home. More importantly, it leaves them four points from safety with 10 games still to play. Not impossible with a fair wind... They couldn\u2019t, could they? Norwich have given themselves a fighting chance of survival with a crucial win. Well done them. 90min+4 Norwich have a free kick deep in the Leicester half with only a minute to play Drmic almost makes it 2-0. Time\u2019s almost up now anyway and Carrow Road is jumping... 90min+1 Five minutes added time as another cross from Chilwell goes astray. Norwich are almost home and hosed. 89 min Nothing doing again as Leicester are frustrated in attack. A break from Norwich then sees Schmeichel called into action to deny Stiepermann. 87 min Stiepermann enters the fray in what will be the last change of the night. He comes on for Duda, who has played well but should really have scored. 85 min It\u2019s not looking great for Leicester, who are struggling to create anything as the clock ticks down. Lots of sideways passing but no killer ball. 81 min That\u2019s enough for Pukki, who has been replaced by Josip Drmic as Norwich look to see this through. \u201cIt may not look sexy stats-wise but this has been a very watchable match between two likeable teams,\u201d emails Speakeasy Ray seven minutes ago. \u201cNorwich hardly look cowed and the Foxes look dangerous - that Canaries goal sets this up for a brilliant 20 minutes.\u201d 78 min Barnes smashes a wayward shot into the River Yare. They\u2019ll need a boat for that one. On comes Marc Albrighton for Perez in a last throw of the dice for Rodgers. 75 min Leicester are pushing forward and almost found a way through down the right just now after good play from Ricardo. Can Norwich stand firm for a second clean sheet of the season at home? 73 min That\u2019s Norwich\u2019s first goal from open play for nearly 700 minutes and a first Premier League goal for Lewis. The ball came to him after a cross from Aarons from the right eluded everyone in the middle but the finish was briliant, swerving right into the corner to leave Schmeichel helpless. Meanwhile Ndidi spurns a chance to equalise almost immediately... Jamal Lewis scores from a crazy angle to give the Canaries hope. What a strike! 68 min Wilfred Ndidi is on for Leicester in his first appearance since 22 January. Meanwhile a knackered Cantwell is replaced by Lukas Rupp 66 min Best chance of the night so far for Norwich and Duda should really have made it 1-0 after a lovely pass from Buendia. He went for power over placement though and Schmeichel was able to make a comfortable save. 65 min Barnes has been a real livewire for Leicester all night and he is the latest to test Krul but again his shot is straight at the goalkeeper. Where\u2019s Jamie Vardy when you need him? At home nursing his calf injury probably. 61 min Schmeichel produces an important reaction save to deny a fierce shot from Duda. Much better from Norwich, who haven\u2019t had a shot on target since the ninth minute apparently. Then Praet brings down Aarons and is duly booked. 57 min Kenny McLean tried his very best to take out Barnes with a cynical challenge but the winger is too quick for him! Lucky boy... 55 min Perez connects well with Chilwell\u2019s cross but the header is well off target. Just had another look at that Iheancho decision and it was incredibly harsh, with the ball just brushing his hand as it fell to his feet. 53 min Grant Hanley takes one for the team to bring down a flying Harvey Barnes and is shown a yellow card for his troubles. The free kick is cleared but it\u2019s been a strong start to this half from the visitors. 51 min The decision to disallow the goal certainly hasn\u2019t gone down well with the Leicester fans, who serenade Carrow Road with a chorus of \u2018Fuck VAR\u2019. It was harsh but them\u2019s the rules these days 49 min Iheanacho has the ball in the net but it\u2019s been disallowed by VAR after replays showed the ball hit his arm as he was bringing it under control. A shame because it was a brilliant finish from outside the box. 47 min Teemu Pukki thought he was in for a second but was correctly flagged offside. There needs to be a big half coming up for him if Norwich are to kick off their great escape. The teams are back out and it doesn\u2019t look like there have been any changes. Let\u2019s go! Some half-time reading if you will forgive the shameless self-promotion.... Both sides had their chances but Leicester will be more disappointed not to be ahead. Now where\u2019s Delia? 45 min+2 Another foul from Maddison gives Norwich a late opportunity in stoppage time but they can\u2019t make it count. 44 min Leicester\u2019s latest chance from a corner falls to Evans but his header is tame and easy for Tim Krul to gather. Maddison is always such a danger from set-pieces. 42 min Cantwell\u2019s mazy run sets up Pukki for a shot at goal but the Finland striker scuffs his shot well wide. Some lovely touches again from the England Under-21 player in the buildup, he\u2019s having a great season despite Norwich\u2019s struggles. 39 min Iheanacho wastes a brilliant opportunity to give Leicester the lead after a mistake from Jamal Lewis but the Nigerian blazes the chance over from six yards out. Replays suggested it may have been disallowed anyway by VAR but it was still a bad miss. 35 min Delia Smith has just been spotted in the stands but it doesn\u2019t look like she is in the mood for another speech. That could change if Norwich concede before half-time of course... 33 min Cantwell prevents Ricardo from whipping in another cross but concedes a corner in the process. But Soyuncu\u2019s overhead kick is so bad it doesn\u2019t even go for a throw-in!! 30 min Ben Chilwell has been receiving treatment next to the dugouts which has allowed Brendan Rodgers to have a quick chat with Maddison and Jonny Evans. More of the same is the instruction I\u2019d imagine. Chilwell is back on his feet again now so we\u2019re all good. 28 min Grant Hanley comes to Norwich\u2019s rescue after great work from Ayoze Perez sees him square the ball across the box. A corner routine then almost sees Iheanacho steal in to convert a brilliant cross from Maddsion. The pressure is building. 26 min Leicester hit the post! Ricardo\u2019s cross from the right is diverted onto the woodwork by Praet, much to the relief of the home supporters. 24 min Some more free-flowing football from Norwich with Cantwell at the heart of it once more. But then his mistake allows Praet to break only for Iheanacho to plant his shot into the river. 22 min Caglar Soyuncu is good looking enough to be a Hollywood movie star but is also pretty good at defending. He had to be at his best to block Pukki\u2019s shot there after some nice buildup play from Norwich. 19 min Nice footwork from Harvey Barnes to set up Dennis Praet for a shot outside the area but it\u2019s straight at the keeper. This game is bubbling up nicely... 14 min Maddison lucky to escape a booking after a foul on Aarons. \u201cNext one,\u201d says referee Craig Pawson 12 min Todd Cantwell is a real talent, as shown by his burst up field just now that saw him brought down for a foul 35 yards out. Buendia shapes to take it but only finds the wall. 9 min Poor defending from Ben Chilwell gives Ondrej Duda the opportunity to cross from the right after a corner and Ben Godfrey\u2019s header is on target but straight at Schmeichel. 7 min An excellent corner from Maddison picks out Hamza Choudhury totally unmarked but his header flies over the bar. A decent chance that 5 min A big night for Kelechi Iheanacho, who has enjoyed something of a revival under Brendan Rodgers. He gets the better of his marker but Leicester can\u2019t make the most of it in the end 2 mins And we\u2019re under way with Max Aarons putting in an early cross for Teemu Pukki which is easily gathered by Schmeichel The rain is coming down hard now in Norwich as the teams emerge onto the pitch. The home manager knows they are up against it but clearly won\u2019t be giving up before it\u2019s all over. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult - we\u2019re realistic,\u201d admits Daniel Farke. \u201cBut you have a chance in every game.\u201d Perhaps they could do with some kryptonite at the back, suggests Richard T. W. Arthur via email \u201cOn my way to the ophthamologist\u2019s, I notice that Norwich have Supermann on the bench,\u201d he writes. \u201cSurely he should be playing? They could certainly use his help.\u201d Norwich have the fewest points at home this season in the Premier League with just 12 so it\u2019s no surprise they are rock bottom. They have kept just one clean sheet at home this season and will be wary of the threat posed by Leicester even in Vardy\u2019s absence. A nice interview with James Maddison, who has admitted he has been looking forward to facing his former club all season. He spent two seasons at Carrow Road after joining from Coventry in 2016 but says there will be no room for any sentimentality once the game has started. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a nice occasion but, make no mistake, we\u2019re here to get three points,\u201d Maddison told Sky just now. The erudite Efan Ekoku is a pundit for Sky this evening and he has been assessing why his former side Norwich have struggled so much this season . \u201cI\u2019m disappointed,\u201d said the former striker. \u201cThere have been lots of good performances but they\u2019ve not been able to get across the finishing line enough.\u201d By way of pure coincidence, it happens to be exactly 15 years to the night since Delia Smith\u2019s infamous half-time teamtalk during their match against Manchester City. Here\u2019s a reminder of her stirring words as you\u2019ve never heard them before... So much for my bit about Vardy in the preamble then! As well as Leicester fans, I\u2019m sure there are a few Fantasy League managers also reeling from his absence tonight. This could be a big opportunity for Norwich to get three points but then again it\u2019s not all about Vardy with this Brendan Rodgers\u2019 team... And there\u2019s a boost for Norwich fans who like their playmakers with the news that Emi Buendia is back in the team having been left on the bench recently by Daniel Farke. Some early team news and it\u2019s a big shock with Jamie Vardy not in the Leicester squad due to a reported calf injury. Kelechi Iheanacho comes in up top Evening all. Welcome to our coverage of tonight\u2019s Premier League game between Norwich and Leicester at Carrow Road. It\u2019s almost do-or-die for the Canaries with games quickly running out to save themselves from the drop as they prepare to welcome the high-flying Foxes to East Anglia. Seven points stand between Daniel Farke\u2019s side and safety going into this match but you can bet their supporters will be up for a bit of Friday football under the lights, even with Storm Jorge expected to wreak havoc in the UK this weekend. Can Norwich end their five-match wait for a victory just when they need it most? Meanwhile, Leicester having been licking their wounds after the late defeat to Manchester City last week and will be keen to bounce back tonight with a victory. They still have a nine point lead over Manchester United in fifth but will know that this is a great opportunity to extend that before Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side face Everton on Sunday. The last time Jamie Vardy scored in the Premier League against city on 21 December no one had heard of coronavirus and he was five goals clear of his nearest rival in the race for the Golden Boot. Fast forward 10 weeks and Arsenal\u2019s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has drawn level on 17 so it\u2019s up to Leicester\u2019s talisman to hit back. It could be a thriller.
