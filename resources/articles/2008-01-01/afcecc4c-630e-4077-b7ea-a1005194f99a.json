However, he held some thousands of pounds back for a rainy day. His ship must have come in, because recently he decided to repay the rest - since when he has had great difficulty in making contact with anyone in the well-known high street institution that holds it who is prepared to sanction the proposed transaction. This is yet another indication, I feel, of the chaotic state of much modern management in this country, about which my colleague on this page, Simon Caulkin, writes so incisively. It may also be indicative of the culture of modern banks - banks that have burnt their fingers in the abstruse world of 'financial engineering', and that have consequently been so reluctant to lend to one another in recent months. You would have thought, given the credit crunch, that they would welcome the odd repayment. We have certainly reached an interesting stage in banking, to the point where the economists Stephen King and Stuart Green say in the current issue of the journal Global Economics that 'in a world of monetary drought, cutting interest rates alone is unlikely to unblock the system'. (With echoes of Robert Graves, their article is ominously entitled 'Goodbye to all that'.) Which brings us to last week's much-publicised decision by the Bank of England's monetary policy committee to keep interest rates where they are, despite the multiplying signs of serious weakness in the economy. Personally, I have no problem with the MPC's non-decision. As a long-time observer of the Bank, and as a former employee of that venerable institution, I fully understand it may have felt that while a fall in the value of the pound is desirable for competition (because a strong pound is pricing UK exporters out of markets, and encouraging too many imports), it may have been more frightened that a cut in rates would prompt a precipitate fall, which could get out of hand. Given the long-overdue change in sentiment about the pound, the Bank did not need to add to the downward pressure last week. Furthermore, although I am not a mind reader, I can easily imagine how Mervyn King, the beleaguered Governor of the Bank and chairman of the MPC, must have felt as he read none-too-subtle hints in the press that the Prime Minister and Chancellor wanted an early reduction in interest rates. The MPC is supposed to be independent, and its principal concern is simply the 'achievement' of a 2 per cent rate of inflation. Much has been made in the City and in the financial press about the inflationary threat now coming from a combination of the oil price and the impact of higher inflation in China on the previously low price of goods imported by Western economies. This kind of thing worries the Bank too. But I surmise that the MPC is even more worried by the thought that, notwithstanding the price of imported toys, a recession (several months of a contracting economy) could well be on the cards, in which case unemployment, rather than inflation, could be the greater threat to the economy, and the achievement of the inflation target might require a loosening of economic policy. The question is: is monetary policy the ideal weapon, or should the government be thinking of fiscal policy? Now, fiscal policy, to remind younger readers, is an old-fashioned device to regulate the level of output and employment in the economy by varying the level of government expenditure and taxation. It has gone out of fashion in recent decades, hence the rather remarkable obsession with what the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of England do most months when they meet to make decisions about the appropriate level of interest rates. But I note with interest that the concept - indeed, weapon - of fiscal policy has recently been revived in the US context (where I suspect that the threat of recession is even more severe than in the UK) by two formidable economists, Professor Martin Feldstein and Professor Lawrence Summers. This is a most refreshing development. Our current fiscal rules - useful at one time to help the Labour party to banish the ghosts of times past - may need to be adjusted. In the end, economic policy should be about keeping the economy going, provided the result is not rip-roaring inflation, which ends up not keeping the economy going. A fortiori, economic policy should be geared to warding off recessions - when, as President Truman said, the other fellow loses his job, and depressions - when, as Truman also said, you lose your job. Now, the Nobel laureate Robert Mundell concluded, in a seminal article in 1963, that 'fiscal policy has a strong effect on employment under fixed exchange rates, while monetary policy has a strong effect on employment under flexible exchange rates'. But when you have a crisis in the banking system, as Stephen King has pointed out, certain bets may be off. Whether or not the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England reduce interest rates may not matter that much. The fashionable view is that governments such as the UK's (and the US's) have been foolish and culpable because during the good times they did not run budget surpluses when they could have done. This is incontrovertible. But when there is a crisis, we need all hands on the fiscal deck. Even the dirty hands."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
