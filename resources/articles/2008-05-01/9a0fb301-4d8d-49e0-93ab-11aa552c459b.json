There are things here you've probably never seen before: apparently infinite Chinese factories; vast man-made landscapes of junk; graveyards of rusting ships. Ostensibly a documentary on photographer Edward Burtynsky, this skims over some big issues - environmental degradation, artistic integrity, China's manufacturing supremacy - but the awesome images speak for themselves. Where In The World Is Osama Bin Laden? (12A) (Morgan Spurlock, 2008, Fra/US) 93 mins. If he really had found Bin Laden, we'd know, wouldn't we? But even without the futile premise, Spurlock's nice-guy persona and comical stunts sit uneasily with the strife and religious fundamentalism he sets out to explore. Speed Racer (PG) (Andy &amp; Larry Wachowski, 2008, US) Emile Hirsch, John Goodman. 129 mins. Very much a kids' movie, this painfully colourful auto adventure is too lurid and frenetic for its own good. It's like watching a video game of Wacky Races - that someone else is playing. What Happens In Vegas (12A) (Tom Vaughan, 2008, US) Ashton Kutcher, Cameron Diaz. 99 mins. It's guy-vs-girl as an accidental couple hit the jackpot then fight over the loot, in a romcom that goes to extreme lengths to be unromantic, but finds being unfunny relatively easy. Honeydripper (PG) (John Sayles, 2007, US) Danny Glover. 123 mins. Glover strives to keep his blues club afloat in 1950s Alabama in this pleasantly rambling tale, set on the threshhold of both rock &amp; roll and the Civil Rights movement. I Served The King Of England (15) (Jiri Menzel, 2006, Cz/Slov) Ivan Barnev, Julia Jentsch. 120 mins. Sumptuous, comically ironic Czech parable, following a short waiter with big ambitions who ingratiates himself with the Nazis. Doomsday (18) (Neil Marshall, 2008, UK) Rhona Mitra, Bob Hoskins, Craig Conway. 109 mins. Unashamed post-apocalyptic pulp in a Mad Max vein, as a crack team take on the barbarians of Glasgow in search of a cure for a killer virus. Silly but spectacular. XXY (15) (Lucia Puenzo, 2007, Arg/Fra/Spa) Ines Efron. 86 mins. Mature, compassionate Cannes-winning portrait of a Uruguayan teen with plenty of reasons to be confused - chiefly that he/she's a hermaphrodite. Vexille (12A) (Fumihiko Sori, 2007, Japan) 109 mins. As good a Japanese anime as we've seen in a while, with slick animation and an intriguing story in which agents penetrate a self-exiled Japan, circa 2077. A Secret (15) (Claude Miller, 2007, Fra) C\u00e9cile de France. 106 mins. Solid, star-studded drama switching back and forth in time to tell a tragic French-Jewish family history. Cashback (15) (Sean Ellis, 2006, UK) Sean Biggerstaff, Emilia Fox. 102 mins. An insomniac art student uses his ability to freeze time to voyeuristic ends, making for a rather dodgy drama. Winter Soldier (NC) (Winterfilm Collective, 1972, US) 96 mins. Returning soldiers give first-hand accounts of the horrors of the Vietnam war in this extraordinary documentary. Mouth To Mouth (15) (Alison Murray, 2005, UK/Ger) Ellen Page. 101 mins. Page in pre-Juno mode, as a teen who joins an idealistic travelling Euro youth cult. Out from Friday Smart People Intellectual satire, indie-style, with Dennis Quaid and Thomas Haden Church. Charlie Bartlett Teen saga aspiring to be a Ferris Bueller for the Prozac generation. Caramel Female-powered comedy set in a Beirut beauty parlour. Heartbeat Detector Mathieu Amalric plays a psychologist in a tense French corporate thriller. La Antena Imaginative Argentinian fantasy set in a silent world. Outpost Soldiers get a taste of supernatural horror. Terror's Advocate Documentary on a highly controversial lawyer. The Air I Breathe Star-studded set of stories based on a Chinese proverb. RFK Must Die Startling re-examination of Bobby Kennedy's assassination. Some Came Running Frank Sinatra plays a soldier coming home. Coming soon In two weeks... Harrison Ford tries to keep a clear head in Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull... In three weeks... High heels and high hopes for Sex And The City... Aleister Crowley returns in Chemical Wedding... In a month... Ben Affleck's Maddie-delayed missing girl drama Gone Baby Gone..."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
