Cavalieri's agent told Brazilian media: \"We will conclude everything soon. He has already had the necessary medical examinations, talked with some of his new team-mates and has been impressed by what Rafael Ben\u00edtez had to say to him.\" Liverpool expect to recoup \u00a32m by selling the French keeper Charles Itandje to Galatasaray. They have already signed the full-backs Philipp Degen and Andrea Dossena. The Brazilian's signing could signal the end of Scott Carson's Liverpool career."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
