After a run of dud translations from screen to stage, here is Rufus Norris's first-rate production of Thomas Vinterberg's 1998 Festen, the film that made the Dogme school famous. A bourgeois Danish family gathers for a patriarch's sixtieth birthday. The favoured son gets up to propose a toast, only months after his twin sister drowned herself. The guests beam sympathetically but confidently. And the young man denounces his father for repeatedly raping him and his sister when they were children. All hell breaks loose. But slowly. Menace mingles with decorum: long, freezing silences are broken only by the scraping of cutlery. These are characters who are both stifled by convention and stunted by what has happened to them. In a uniformly strong cast, Jonny Lee Miller proves again what a natural stage actor he is. Taking the role of the accusing son, a part that could easily be made histrionic, he's the more convincing for seeming awkward, at sea: he mumbles his way towards mayhem. As his equally authentic thug brother, Tom Hardy is all explosive insolence with rolling, tattooed shoulders and open jaw. These two make sense as siblings. Around them, everything melds under Norris's bold, stately direction. Ian MacNeil's design and Jean Kalman's lighting first combine to create a Last Supper: a long Scandinavian table glows sumptuously. But when the revelations begin to bite, a black screen slides open to show a wanly lit, cinder-coloured no-man's-land. And - the most innovative touch of the evening - Paul Arditti has made an unforgettable soundscape which evokes the dead sister both as girl and as drowning adult: the sounds of running water and a child's faraway laughter are always in the background. David Eldridge has produced a trim adaptation. He's increased the claustrophobia of the feast by reducing the number of guests, and emphasised the grimness of the accusations by sending the figure of a prepubescent child, a granddaughter of the household, flitting through the action in pyjamas or fairy costume. He has also underlined by quotation the echoes of Hamlet: the smooth, authoritative Danish dad, the dead girl, the ambiguous mother and the hero who seems to have gone mad but may be telling a truth. These are echoes which help to give Festen an added resonance in the theatre: some 40 versions are now being staged around the world. But this would grip without any Shakespearean references: it's dramatic dynamite. Charlotte Jones's new play is not so much a drama as a sleek piece of stagecraft. Jones, who shot to West End success with Humble Boy, her variation on Hamlet, has always projected her meanings as much through structure as through dialogue, and she's always risked being schematic. The urban snapshot of The Dark's opening moments is the play's best insight. In Lez Brotherston's dextrous though charm-free, grey-and-black design, the inhabitants of a row of terraced houses are seen in their isolation and proximity: in different homes, on the same stage. An elderly woman peers through a magnifying glass at weird bits of her boiled egg; the face of an adolescent boy is lit by the blue reflection of a laptop; no one speaks, but from all around the stage come sighs, knocks and clinks. When a powercut strikes, each life is seen as if in X-ray, defined by a different terror: cot-death, paedophilia, cancer, internet porn. Halfway through the play, the characters perform a sort of listless conga, traipsing through the rooms, up and down the stairs, briefly entering each other's minds and space (and sometimes speaking in unison with the same words), spreading the bleakness around. No box goes unticked, including the box in the corner: one character explains that she never wants to watch the TV news because she prefers 'reality TV'. The play pivots on a kind of anti-drama - the idea that extraordinary (well, unbelievable) things happen in a crisis and that, afterwards, people will forget them, that they will be most in the dark when the lights go on. It's no accident that the most important thing that happens to one character takes place when he loses consciousness. All of which is fine as a thesis, but not so good for an audience, who want something to remain with them at the end of a play. Not much of this will. A fine cast, which includes Roger Lloyd Pack and Brid Brennan, are given cartoons to embody. Anastasia Hille touches the part of a fearful mother with her fluorescent intensity, but no one, including Sin Phillips, could redeem the part of comic Cockney crone. The Dark is a power failure. You couldn't say that for Homage to Catalonia, which sprawls and confuses but never aspires to being tidy. This huge international collaborative effort between West Yorkshire Playhouse, Northern Stage, Teatre Romea, Forum Barcelona and MC93 Bobigny effectively mimics the muddle of the Spanish Civil War in its design (hundreds of boots or sleeping bags flat on the floor), its language (half in Catalan, half in English) and, unhappily, in its mood (switchbacking from tragedy to facetiousness). No one could fail to be stirred and moved by the devastating documentary footage - not so much black-and-white as brown - that runs at the back of the stage and shows the reality of the Spanish Civil War: an old woman sitting stiffly in front of her ruined house; a limp child lifted from a shattered building. But what commentary could ever add to these pictures? This one doesn't. George Orwell's matter-of-fact words are ranted rather than narrated. The stage should be the right place to animate the complicated, flexible viewpoints of Homage to Catalonia , and what better time could there be for a reassessment of Catalonia? But this is an instance of film overwhelming theatre. Three to see Suddenly Last Summer Norwich Theatre Royal Michael Grandage's tremendous production stars Victoria Hamilton and Diana Rigg.
