That urge for collaboration is apparent on his eighth album for Domino, with Hot Chip's Alexis Taylor producing and KT Tunstall contributing vocals. A hushed, thoughtful collection, it finds Yorkston reflecting on the death of Doogie Paul, his double bass player, on the powerfully moving Broken Wave. Elsewhere, the tone is more conversational, as on the charming Guy Fawkes' Signature, while covering Chris Bell's You and Your Sister is an inspired choice."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
