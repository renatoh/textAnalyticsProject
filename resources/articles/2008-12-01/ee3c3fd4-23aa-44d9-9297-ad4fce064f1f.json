Former Sunderland \u2014 and Arsenal, Manchester City and Republic of Ireland \u2014 centre-forward who persauded a group of primarily Irish businessmen to form the original nine-man Drumaville consortium and buy the former chairman, and owner, Bob Murray out for \u00a310m in 2006. A prodigious fundraiser for charity, his instinct may be to go for a British or Irish manager. Genuinely one of the nicest, brightest, men in football and among the most supportive chairmen. Was briefly Sunderland's chairman/manager before Keane's installation but struggled in the dug-out. Ellis Short largely Texas-based Irish-American financier who became Sunderland's majority shareholder in September, he has a controlling 30% stake. Likes to remain behind the scenes and leave day-to-day running of the club to Quinn, but will inevitably have a significant say in new managerial appointment. Quinn met him at the 2006 Ryder Cup at the K Club near Dublin and he made his first, smaller, investment in the club a year ago. His US home is now in Dallas but Short grew up in Independence, Missouri before making his fortune in the world of private equity and hedge fund management, founding the equity firm Lone Star in the mid-1990s. Heavily involved in banking take-overs, he masterminded the 2003 purchase of the Korea Exchange bank for $1.5bn. He later purchased Skibo Castle in Scotland for \u00a323m. Is thought to favour a younger manager, possibly foreign, with a proven track record. Steve Walton Sunderland's incoming chief executive. Walton is not due to formally take up the post until March but Quinn has involved him in the hunt for Keane's successor. Walton boasts more than 30 years experience in corporate banking and joins from Barclays, where he spent over a decade as director of football (sponsorships). Currently corporate director of Barclays Bank in the north-east, he also spent five months working for Newcastle United in 2007 after being headhunted by that club's former chairman, Freddy Shepherd. However Walton proved surplus to Mike Ashley's requirements. Peter Walker Sunderland's outgoing chief executive is also involved in the manager hunt. Walker will, however, leave the club at the end of the month in order to join a company run by Sunderland's former chairman, Bob Murray, and spent more time with his young family. Lesley Callaghan The only female executive board member, Callaghan has risen from her original post as Sunderland's press officer to become the club's communications and marketing director. Callaghan is repsonsible for all Sunderland's UK-based marketing operations. In Shepherd's day at St James' Park Newcastle made a failed attempt to poach her. She will be involved in board meetings relating to the managerial appointment and will assess the likely media reaction to various candidates. Chris Woerts Sunderland's new international development business manager. Headhunted by Short, he was previously Feyenoord's chief executive and has also had key roles working for Coca-Cola and Heineken. Although he does not officially begin his new job until the New Year, Woerts is believed to have input in the manager search. Boasts extensive European contacts and inside knowledge of Dutch football and managers. Non-Executive Directors Quinn has said the executive directors are responsible for selecting the new manager but Sunderland's non-executive directors \u2013 all members of the Drumaville consortium \u2013 will surely be allowed an informal say. They are John Hays, the managing director of Hays travel and non-executive vice-chairman, Pat Beirne, Paul Keogh, Charlie Chawke, John Ryan and Owen McGartoll."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
