Eddie Jones is not yet convinced Vunipola is ready for the first Test against South Africa on 9 June but the player is, as long as he sticks to rugby. It is a hamstring injury that concerns Jones, and Vunipola has been sparingly managed by Saracens in the closing parts of the season because of it. What Jones has been unaware of is that his first-choice No 8, probably his best player when at full throttle, suffered a relapse just before Saracens\u2019 Premiership semi-final win over Wasps when innocuously trying his hand, or should that be foot, at Aussie rules. \u201cIt was my fault, I was doing some AFL kicking and then hammy went tight before the game,\u201d Vunipola says. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell the coaches that but when I came off at half-time against Wasps I told them. I was like: \u2018Sorry guys, I was doing AFL kicking.\u2019 I stitched myself up there. Then we had to manage it a bit better [before the Premiership final], I had to manage myself a bit better the week after. \u201cI felt I was back to normal and when I feel I\u2019m back to normal I forget I was injured and that\u2019s probably why I get injured all the time. I\u2019m supposed to strap my arm up but I hate wearing strapping so I just don\u2019t use it. I get this weird thing in my head that if I\u2019m strapped, I\u2019m injured. So I try not to \u2013 if I\u2019m playing, I\u2019m playing and if I\u2019m injured, I\u2019m injured.\u201d Vunipola\u2019s last England appearance came at the end of the 2017 Six Nations but Jones has since admitted it was a \u201cbad gamble\u201d to throw him in against Ireland after he had just returned from another injury. It would explain the coach\u2019s caution but Vunipola is confident he will be ready to face the Springboks in Johannesburg . \u201cI will be fine,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt is just managing what I am doing and my hamstring is fine. I feel strong again, I had a really good start to the week. Hopefully, next week I\u2019ll train fully and I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d There can be little doubt that Jones is desperate to have a fit and firing Vunipola in South Africa. As the defeats clocked up during the Six Nations, his absence only enhanced his status as Jones\u2019s best player \u2013 even if his brother and a couple of Saracens team-mates may have something to say about that. He insists he does not bring too much expectation but he is in no doubt as to the role he is required to perform. \u201cI have to prove myself but I have to do that every time I play and the biggest way we can do that is standing up to this physical South African team,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ve got Bismarck du Plessis back, if that\u2019s not an indication of what they\u2019re going to try to do then I don\u2019t know what is. Duane Vermeulen is back, Kolisi is their skipper \u2013 he\u2019s not exactly small. Their second-rows are built like oak trees so we\u2019ve got to go out there and fly into it. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to fight for everything. It\u2019s exciting because it\u2019s quite simple, obviously we want to play heads-up rugby but when we\u2019re in defence we\u2019ve got to fight, scrap for everything and just annoy them. For me the challenge is: \u2018Are we up for this, or not?\u2019\u201d Vunipola is building up a head of steam. The physical battle that awaits against the Springboks clearly excites someone who has not played for England for so long. Shoulder, knee and, of course, hamstring injuries have followed since that defeat by Ireland in Dublin and Vunipola has clearly missed confrontation on the international stage. \u201cIt\u2019s basically what I think the sport is created for and then the All Blacks came in and started playing really good rugby and everyone changed,\u201d he says. \u201cHopefully it\u2019s going to be old school, just whose dad is bigger than whose dad. That\u2019s the challenge we\u2019ve got ahead of us, we\u2019ve got to embrace it or we\u2019ll be on the losing side. \u201cWe get there, we\u2019re in South Africa, rugby is by far the biggest sport there. We\u2019ve just got to scrap for everything. If we\u2019re annoying or making them frustrated that\u2019s probably the best sign of how up for it we are. It means we\u2019re in their faces, otherwise they will just bully us off the park. That\u2019s what they used to do really well and obviously with a new coach coming in they\u2019ll just go back to how they used to beat other teams \u2013 run over them, beat them up. Using their big, physical pack to wear you down. We\u2019ve got to try to stand up to that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
