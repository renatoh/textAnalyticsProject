The victory over Manchester City yesterday, courtesy of Essien's goal, was Chelsea's fourth in succession in the league under Hiddink and, after Manchester United endured a humiliating defeat at home to Liverpool the previous day, the pursuit of the leaders has been revived. The Londoners expect to be without their midfielder Deco for the rest of the season after the veteran suffered a relapse of a hamstring injury, though he is due to undergo a scan. The results of similar checks on Didier Drogba's knee have proved more positive, however. The Ivorian, who was also forced to leave the pitch early against City, has been given the all-clear and is expected to resume training tomorrow ahead of Saturday's tricky trip to Tottenham Hotspur. That news will help Chelsea approach the final nine Premier League games still hopeful the champions can be reeled in. \"We've got to push them right to the end,\" said Terry. \"We have shown our strength and character in the last month, and if we keep doing that we can apply some pressure. If they slip up, they know we're coming up behind them. Since the new manager has come in, we've played very well and got the right results. \"He has changed a few things, and given a few of us a kick up the backside which I think we needed. Manchester United have good players, but after a big defeat like they had last weekend you never know how they're going to react. Hopefully they're going to go on a bad run, but the main thing for us to do is to keep winning and applying the pressure.\" The margins for error may still be slim but there is a new-found confidence driving on this Chelsea team, the stuttering form of the last few weeks of Luiz Felipe Scolari's brief reign having apparently been exorcised, with the return of Ricardo Carvalho and Essien adding to Hiddink's options. The Ghanaian's impact has been immediate, a goal against Juventus last week helping to smooth the team's passage into the quarter-finals of the Champions League, with another on his first league start since 31 August having duly deflected City. His energy and versatility had been sorely missed. \"Only Michael could do that,\" said Terry. \"Only he could come back and after two games have scored two goals and play as well as he has been. After so long out you think it would take three or four games to find his feet, but he is an absolute machine. You see him working his socks off for six months in the gym and it pays dividends. He is brilliant and it's great to have him back.\" \"You can see his energy and spirit is coming back to the team,\" added Florent Malouda. \"That helps the game for the strikers because he is running and running, and keeps on running. He has a positive attitude and gives a lot of confidence to the team, and he can make the difference, of course. He is going to be really important for our midfield play from now on in. He will want to show he can bring something new. \"We are still trying to win three trophies, and Michael shares that spirit. Seeing Manchester United lose on Saturday gives us a big hope. The most important thing about that result is that it will give hope to the other teams who still have to play United [that they can be beaten]. It shows it is possible.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
