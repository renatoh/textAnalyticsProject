What had looked like being a routine home win beforehand turned into a torturous ordeal for Villa, who only salvaged a point with eight minutes remaining, when John Carew grabbed his second goal. Villa supporters rejoiced, but there was no celebrating at the final whistle. After taking four points from trips to Stoke and Wigan, this was an opportunity missed. Martin O'Neill tried to accentuate the positives, highlighting a \"mesmerising\" performance from Ashley Young in front of Fabio Capello, but in truth that was about the only crumb of comfort Villa could take from an afternoon in which, the opening 20 minutes apart, they looked sluggish and badly missed the injured Gabriel Agbonlahor's pace. Carew gave Villa the lead during that period with a sidefoot finish that replays showed should have been disallowed for offside, but two Wolves goals later in the half turned the match on its head. Both concessions were so bad that it was difficult to believe Villa had started the day with the best defensive record in the Premier League. The natives were restless and when the interval came they made their feelings known, greeting half-time with boos. O'Neill was far from impressed. \"In the opening 20 minutes of the game, it was as good as we have played in recent times, I thought it was really scintillating,\" he said. \"You should have got long odds on us being booed off at half-time. I suppose Carling Cup final, semi-final of the FA Cup and still battling here with nine games left in the League, maybe that should happen here every year. I expect [the boos] now. It's the nature of the game, more so nowadays than ever before.\" It was not the only unwelcome sound of the afternoon for Villa's manager. The fans chanted Nathan Delfouneso's name in the hope he might appear as a substitute after O'Neill introduced Marc Albrighton ahead of him, while Luke Young was given an ovation when he started to warm up in what can only be interpreted as a sign of the home supporters' frustration with Carlos Cu\u00e9llar's hold on the right-back spot despite the Spaniard's failure to convince with the ball at his feet. In fairness to Cu\u00e9llar, he was not the only Villa player who looked unlikely to set the world alight here when in possession. Stuart Downing and Stilian Petrov flattered to deceive and James Milner, who was involved in the move that led to Carew's breakthrough, when he released Ashley Young, faded after a bright start and had an own goal to his name come the interval, having turned in Matt Jarvis's low centre after David Jones stepped inside Cu\u00e9llar with embarrassing ease. Wolves's opening goal will not make any better viewing for Villa's players. Petrov must accept some of the blame, after his needless foul on Kevin Doyle provided Jones with the opportunity to deliver a free-kick deep into the Villa area, but questions will also be asked of Brad Friedel's decision to stay on his line. Even then the Wolves right-back Ronald Zubar managed to clear the ball, rather than flick it goalbound, before Jody Craddock bundled home. Downing squandered a wonderful chance to bring Villa level just before half-time, when he headed into the ground and over from three yards, but it was not until the 70th minute that Villa seriously threatened again. At that point Wolves could have been forgiven for thinking this was going to be their first victory over their West Midlands rivals in 30 years, but Carew, sweeping in Steve Sidwell's left-foot shot, provided Villa with a late reprieve. Not that Mick McCarthy was downbeat about the outcome. \"It's a fabulous point and a terrific performance,\" said the Wolves manager, whose side go to West Ham United on Tuesday night for a crucial relegation battle. \"I'm sure when the first goal went in everyone thought Villa would win by four or five and we would get a slapping. It's nice to kick against the trend.\" THE FANS' PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT MARK RUTTER, Observer reader I've been trying to get my emotions together after that \u2013 I'm just extremely relieved we came away with a point. There was only one team going for the win \u2013 us \u2013 and, for 20 minutes, I thought it was going to be three- or four-nil. So it was disappointing to be chasing the game in the end. Wolves will be delighted with a draw. They came for a point, but could have ended up with all three. I was bemused by our substitutions - Cu\u00e9llar and Heskey were having bad games, but O'Neill refused to take them off. Milner was our driving force and Carew is playing very well. But we missed Agbonlahor. The fan's player ratings Friedel 6; Cu\u00e9llar 6, Dunne 6 (Albrighton 72 n/a), Collins 6, Warnock 6; A Young 6, Milner 7; Petrov 6, Downing 6 (Sidwell 77 n/a); Carew 8, Heskey 5 TIM SPIERS, Observer reader I would have taken a point at half-time, even though we were winning then, so the final result wasn't too disappointing. The first half was the best we have played all season - for the first time, we looked like we belonged in the Premier League. Mick McCarthy has named the same team for the past six or so games; everyone knows what their job is and looks comfortable on the ball. It's very impressive. David Jones was good in midfield. He gets forward well and is uncomplicated, but effective. We have quite a good run-in and, if we keep up that level of performance, we won't go down. The fan's player ratings Hahnemann 8; Zubar 8, Craddock 8, Berra 7, Ward 7 (Mancienne 64 7); Foley 8, Guedioura 7 (Elokobi ht 7); Henry 8, Jones 9, Jarvis 9 (Iwelumo 89 n/a); Doyle 8 TO TAKE PART IN THE FANS' VERDICT, SPORT@OBSERVER.CO.UK"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
