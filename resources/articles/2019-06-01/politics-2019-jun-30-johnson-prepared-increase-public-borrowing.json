Johnson, the overwhelming favourite to replace Theresa May as prime minister in just over three weeks, said that while there was fiscal \u201cheadroom\u201d to spend more, if needed he would use low interest rates to borrow for new infrastructure. Speaking to Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Johnson also talked about wanting to raise the national living wage, but seemed unable to say what level it was currently set at. On Brexit, the former foreign secretary dismissed the unanimous view of EU leaders that the UK\u2019s departure deal could not be renegotiated before 31 October, saying this was a negotiating ruse, and \u201cyou would expect them to say that kind of thing\u201d. Johnson was asked how a government of his could spend the promised \u00a34.6bn a year extra on schools, boost transport in the north, roll out UK-wide ultra-fast broadband, have 20,000 extra police, and cut taxes. Arguing that some of his tax cuts would create extra revenue and stimulate growth, Johnson said: \u201cWhat is certainly true is at the moment there is cash available. There\u2019s headroom of about \u00a322bn to \u00a325bn at the moment.\u201d Asked if he would increase borrowing, he said: \u201cIf it\u2019s borrowing to finance great infrastructure projects, and there\u2019s the opportunity to borrow at low rates, to do things for the long-term benefit of the country, then we should do them.\u201d Johnson added: \u201cI\u2019m prepared to borrow to finance certain great objectives, but overall we will keep fiscal responsibility, and keep going with the general trajectory of ensuring that this country pays its way and lives within its means. But you can do that with some sensible tax cuts that will stimulate growth, stimulate enterprise, get more enterprise in.\u201d Johnson said he would want to increase the national living wage \u2013 the new official name for the minimum wage \u2013 but declined to say by how much: \u201cI certainly believe in lifting the living wage, but I\u2019m not going to set a figure now.\u201d Asked by Ridge how much the living wage currently was \u2013 it is \u00a38.21 an hour \u2013 Johnson said \u201caround \u00a310 or so\u201d. He explained that he had instead meant the London living wage, currently \u00a310.55 an hour, which is a higher, non-compulsory figure intended to reflect real living costs. On Brexit, Johnson dismissed the repeated comments by EU figures that his stated plan to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement could not happen, saying this view would rapidly change once he became prime minister. \u201cPossibly it\u2019s the case that they would say that at this particular stage in the negotiations. You would expect them to say that kind of thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they are going to want a disorderly Brexit of any kind. It\u2019s not in their interest. There\u2019s no reason why they should want the sudden imposition of tariffs and quotas.\u201d Johnson repeatedly refused, again, to accept personal responsibility for comments he made about Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian women jailed in Tehran, and whether they, as her family believe, had worsened her plight. \u201cOf course I feel very bad about all the consular cases in Iran, particularly Nazanin,\u201d he said, insisting that Iran was solely responsible and it was wrong to \u201callow whatever I may have said or done to cloud the issue\u201d. He similarly dismissed criticism of his comments from the past about black and gay people, and Muslim women who wear full-face veils. Asked by Ridge whether he would \u201cjust say anything to get a laugh\u201d, Johnson replied: \u201cNo. I think if you look at each and every one of those columns or articles you\u2019ll find that the quotations have been wrenched out of context, in many cases made to mean the opposite of what was intended.\u201d Quizzed on whether he took responsibility for anything, Johnson said he would so for Brexit. \u201cI played a part in that campaign and I\u2019m very proud of what we did but I take personal responsibility now for what is happening to our country, for the drift and the dither, and the indecision, and the failure to be sufficiently robust in the negotiations which we\u2019ve seen so far,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I want to add now is my own ability, I think, to lead us out of this mess, to get Brexit done by 31 October, and then to do for the whole country what we did in London which is to bring it together.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
