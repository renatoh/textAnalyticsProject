Geoffrey Robertson QC said: \u201cThe trustees of the British Museum have become the world\u2019s largest receivers of stolen property, and the great majority of their loot is not even on public display.\u201d He criticised the museum for allowing an unofficial \u201cstolen goods tour\u201d, \u201cwhich stops at the Elgin marbles, Hoa Hakananai\u2019a, the Benin bronzes and other pilfered cultural property\u201d. The three items he mentioned are wanted by Greece, Easter Island and Nigeria respectively. \u201cThat these rebel itineraries are allowed is a tribute to the tolerance of this great institution, which would be even greater if it washed its hands of the blood and returned Elgin\u2019s loot,\u201d Robertson said. He accused the museum of telling \u201ca string of carefully-constructed lies and half- truths\u201d about how the marbles \u201cwere \u2018saved\u2019 or \u2018salvaged\u2019 or \u2018rescued\u2019 by Lord Elgin, who came into possession of them lawfully.\u201d He criticised \u201cencyclopaedic museums\u201d such as the British Museum, the Louvre in Paris and the Metropolitan in New York that \u201clock up the precious legacy of other lands, stolen from their people by wars of aggression, theft and duplicity\u201d. Robertson\u2019s views appear in his book, Who Owns History? Elgin\u2019s Loot and the Case for Returning Plundered Treasure. He writes: \u201cThis is a time for humility \u2013 something the British, still yearning for the era when they ruled the world, ie for Brexit, do not do very well. Before it releases any of its share of other people\u2019s cultural heritage, the British Museum could mount an exhibition \u2013 \u2018The Spoils of Empire\u2019.\u201d Others argue that the empire also brought benefits, including education and legislation. Advocating the return of cultural property based on human rights law principles, Robertson observes that the French president, Emmanuel Macron has \u201cgalvanised the debate\u201d by declaring that \u201cAfrican cultural heritage can no longer remain a prisoner of European museums\u201d. \u201cPoliticians may make more or less sincere apologies for the crimes of their former empires, but the only way now available to redress them is to return the spoils of the rape of Egypt and China and the destruction of African and Asian and South American societies,\u201d he writes. \u201cWe cannot right historical wrongs \u2013 but we can no longer, without shame, profit from them.\u201d Robertson prepared a report on the reunification of the Elgin marbles for the Greek government with Amal Clooney and the late Professor Norman Palmer. In his new book, he acknowledges that restitution might well encourage further claims, \u201calthough \u2013 because the Marbles are unique \u2013 not necessarily successful ones\u201d. He writes: \u201cThe Benin bronzes, for example, are art which is important to Africa, but not to the world in the way that the marbles have international resonance. On the other hand, the barbaric manner of the taking of the bronzes amounted to a war crime, which is morally more despicable than Elgin\u2019s theft and duplicity.\u201d He accuses museum trustees and the government of passing the buck when it comes to answering requests for the return of cultural property. He also criticises the lack of diversity among trustees. Julian Spalding, the former head of Glasgow, Sheffield and Manchester museums, agreed that the British Museum should give the Elgin marbles back \u201cbecause they\u2019re an intrinsic part of one the world\u2019s greatest works of art\u201d. A British Museum spokeswoman confirmed that it allows a \u201cstolen goods tour\u201d, run by an external guide. She said the Elgin marbles were acquired legally, with the approval of the Ottoman authorities of the day. \u201cThey were not acquired as a result of conflict or violence. Lord Elgin\u2019s activities were thoroughly investigated by a parliamentary select committee in 1816 and found to be entirely legal,\u201d she said. \u201cThe British Museum acknowledges the difficult histories of some of its collections, including the contested means by which some collections have been acquired such as through military action and subsequent looting \u2026 In the case of the Benin bronzes, the museum visited Benin City in 2018 to talk about plans for a new Royal Museum in Benin City and how the museum could help.\u201d Who Owns History?
