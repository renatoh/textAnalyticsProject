Jonze had a screen role in Three Kings but the director was David O Russell. 'This is how bold I am with costume dramas,\" says Peter Bowker over tea and digestives in his west London kitchen. \"When I did A Christmas Carol, we had Ross Kemp as Scrooge. I don't shy away from bold adaptations, me.\" He's joking at his own expense, of course, but right now Bowker is one of British telly's most exciting and versatile TV writers. He has just written a drama series, Desperate Romantics, that promises to give Britain's most unfashionable art movement an intriguing counter-cultural makeover. But do the pre-Raphaelites warrant such a treatment? \"Of course they do!\" says Bowker, spluttering biscuit crumbs. \"They upset everybody. Dickens wrote about how he hated a Millais painting because it depicted Jesus as a redhead. This was long before Paul Scholes made the notion of a ginger Messiah acceptable.\" Bowker is, harrowing to relate, a Man U fan. There's a scene in Desperate Romantics, which starts tonight on BBC2, in which the pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood strut down the London pavement on the libidinous hunt for flame-haired Lizzie Siddal (those boys liked their redheads), who is to become their muse. Swaggering four abreast, it would have been no surprise if the director had decided to rip off the music from Reservoir Dogs on the soundtrack. In Bowker's hands, those seemingly conservative daubers become, as one critic has already put it, \"young, dumb and full of laudanum\". The BBC is billing Bowker's drama as marrying the pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood to the values of Desperate Housewives. It's going with the notion that the Brotherhood were rebels whose function was to puncture their painterly predecessors' pretensions; what the Sex Pistols were to pomp-rock noodlers Genesis. Or something like that. The drama is also much more about thwarted sex than pre-Raphaelite enthusiasts may find tolerable. It's as though Bowker has gone to Andrew Davies, the iconic TV adapter of Pride and Prejudice and Bleak House: \"Davies? You think you're the only writer who can unleash the passion from those dusty frock coats and bodices for the telly? Suck on this baby.\" In fact, Bowker had vowed never to write about artists because, \"ultimately, it was all about Monet staring into the distance and saying something pretentious about the light.\" But he changed his mind when reading Franny Moyle's book Desperate Romantics: the Private Lives of the Pre-Raphaelites. \"Before I knew any better,\" Bowker says disarmingly, \"I loved the pre-Raphaelites. Ophelia? The Lady of Shallot? So sexy for a young, probably disturbed, man. The paintings were filled with testosterone, or at least I thought they were. Only when I hit my late 20s did I realise it was a bit embarrassing looking at them.\" The most intriguing part of Desperate Romantics deals with John Ruskin, and in particular the great critic's vexed sexuality (Ruskin's marriage to Effie Gray was annulled after six years for non-consummation): \"People have had Ruskin down as closeted or that he had a horror of women's bodies, especially their pubic hair, so that when he saw his wife naked he was traumatised. I just think, and this is unfashionable, that he was asexual.\" Bowker says he wrote the series as light relief after Occupation, his critically feted Iraq war drama that was screened earlier this summer. Occupation did two amazing things: it made James Nesbitt unmissable, and it broke the BBC's duck in successfully dramatising the Iraq war. \"It's the sort of serious, ambitious commissioning that justifies the licence fee,\" wrote the Independent's Tom Sutcliffe. \"In fact, it's almost enough to make you forgive them for Bonekickers.\" Why did Occupation work? \"Because, and I shouldn't tell you this, it isn't a war drama at all,\" Bowker admits. \"I wrote it with the ghost of Melvyn Hayes in my mind.\" You mean effeminate Gunner \"Gloria\" Beaumont from the 70s sitcom It Ain't Half Hot, Mum? \"That's him. I remember he said when the war was over, he was going to do a show called Soldiers in Dresses. That was in my head when I wrote Occupation.\" Be serious. \"I am! It's not really about war at all. It's about three men in the aftermath of the Iraq war and why they have to go back there. One goes for love, one out of conscience and the third for money. I watched Three Kings [Spike Jonze's satirical 1999 film starring George Clooney set during the first Iraq war] and that was a caper movie with the war as a backdrop \u2013 it inspired me a lot.\" Occupation was a triumph, Desperate Romantics is poised to be a ratings-grabber this summer, and his bracing reimagining of Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights will be on ITV this autumn. The 50-year-old screenwriter is having an extraordinarily prolific and successful 2009; he is now busy writing about Morecambe and Wise's early years, adapting Mark Haddon's novel A Spot of Bother about a 61-year-old hypochondriac, and sketching a big medical drama series for ITV. What's especially unusual is that he is writing across a lot of different genres. \"It is unusual,\" Bowker agrees, \"but my TV writing heroes are Alan Plater, Jack Rosenthal and Dennis Potter, and they did just that with great confidence in their careers. It's less common today but it's what I want to do.\" And what got him into this TV writing game? \"I was a punk poet in Manchester in the late 70s.\" How very John Cooper Clarke. \"Yeah, I sold poems at Stockport market. Then I worked in a factory making sanitary towels. If there's one place you never want to work as a gauche teenage boy, it's in a sanitary towel factory with one other bloke and lots of terrifying women.\" He also failed as a journalist. \"I got fired from the Stockport Express three weeks before I started work.\" Why? \"I had a row with the editor because he'd said: 'The thing about journalism is that it's a secure profession. Even under the Nazis we'd have a job.' After I told him what I thought about that, he decided he didn't want me to work there. Of course it may have been my denim waistcoat, but I like to think it was my radical anti-Nazi politics that did for me.\" After a string of jobs and a degree in philosophy and English, Bowker found himself being taught by Malcolm Bradbury and Rose Tremain on the MA creative writing course at the University of East Anglia. \"At UEA, a fellow student said to me: 'Pete, you're not really cut out for novels. You only like writing dialogue.' He was right, so I changed courses. And I was the only one on the screenwriting course who admitted to not just liking TV but noticing, say, that Coronation Street or Brookside was good last night because Jimmy McGovern wrote it. Nobody else really cared about TV writing \u2013 it was widely seen simply as a way of making money to fund the novel. \"Television has always been glamorous for me in a way it probably isn't for young writers now,\" Bowker says. \"I always wanted to have my name on telly.\" Yet it took a while: \"I spent more or less 15 years getting rejection slips.\" His first regular work was writing for Peak Practice, Medics and Casualty. \"I seem to have written a lot of medical dramas.\" Was that your aim? \"No, but on the plus side I know a lot about cystic fibrosis.\" His breakthrough TV drama was the 1998 five-hour drama series Undercover Heart. \"Everybody seemed to like the title and initially it was about a love triangle. Then Jon Yorke [the BBC producer] said, 'Couldn't we set this in a police station' and that unlocked it for me. It became about three coppers, two of whom were married and one recently divorced, looking for a dead prostitute. And then getting implicated in the crime.\" Bowker unexpectedly made a lot of money out of Blackpool, his 2004 BBC murder drama series starring David Morrissey as Ripley Holden, a deluded amusement arcade entrepreneur who takes the Lancastrian seaside town to be something like Las Vegas. \"CBS bought it up for a remake set in the States, which was a doomed idea because I'd written it about Ripley's delusion. He couldn't be deluded if it was set in the States, because any American city is cool and big compared to Blackpool.\" The money he got from CBS for this duff retread seemed, to Bowker, in some ways unwarranted. \"If you're a plumber and you've put in a bath, you don't get paid every time it gets filled with water.\" But it must have been quite a pay day for you? \"It didn't make me a millionaire, but it helped, that's for sure.\" And what did you think of the American version? \"Dreadful.\" He is infinitely more proud of what he's done with the sulkiest monster of English literature, Heathcliff, in his new adaptation of Wuthering Heights \u2013 even though he concedes that he initially approached Emily Bront\u00eb's book from the wrong angle. \"I loved Heathcliff's class hatred. I really wanted him to stick it to those toff bastards. But of course that's a monstrous misreading. To revenge yourself for the crimes of others against you on innocent children is immoral. But I still want Heathcliff to get under your skin to such an extent that what he does makes sense to you, and you can go with it some of the way, at least.\" The Bront\u00ebblog (bronteblog.blogspot.com) is now atremble with febrile worryings about what Bowker has done to their beloved classic. Challenged to explain himself after his adaptation was screened on TV earlier this year in the US, Bowker defended himself stoutly online for junking the narrator Lockwood, shrinking the religious zealot Joseph to next to nothing, and starting his adaptation halfway through the book's narrative. He changed the structure so radically, starting the story with the children of Heathcliff and Cathy before cutting back to what cursed their lives, that some of Emily Bront\u00eb's devotees in cyberspace feared they'd begun watching the thing halfway through. \"My partner Kate, who's a couples counsellor, gave me the key to the novel's psychology. She said that the wonderful speech in which Cathy says 'I am Heathcliff' tells you the relationship isn't going to work, even though it's one of the great declarations of romantic passion.\" Intriguingly, that speech was cited by Simone de Beauvoir as the cry of every woman in love. \"The idea is that Heathcliff and Cathy are cleaved from a single soul, which is hopeless,\" Bowker says. \"If Kate had seen Heathcliff and Cathy, she'd have told them in the first session that their relationship hadn't got a future. \"The thing about Wuthering Heights is that you could just type out pages of it, it's so good \u2013 but you can't. Andrew Davies was right when he said that the ambition that keeps you going is to write a scene that doesn't exist in the book, but which will have everyone going back to the novel to look for it.\" Have you written any like that? \"One or two,\" says Bowker proudly. \"I've made up some dialogue between Heathcliff and Cathy because there is so little of them in the book \u2013 you can't just have Nelly Dean [the novel's second, and unreliable, narrator] going, 'Oooh they loved each other.' You have to show them together in love. Andrew is right when he says adapting a classic is harder than you think. Writing for telly is much harder than you think. It isn't money for old rope, you know.\" Desperate Romantics is on BBC2 at 9pm tonight. Wuthering Heights will be screened on ITV1 in the autumn"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
