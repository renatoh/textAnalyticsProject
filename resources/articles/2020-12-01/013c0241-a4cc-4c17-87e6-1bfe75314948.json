Soon after Joshua knocked out Kubrat Pulev on Saturday night, Fury went on Instagram to claim he would dispatch his fellow world champion in three rounds. Joshua, in contrast, chose not to call out Fury during an interview he did with some reluctance on Sky Sports after his most impressive performance in years. \u201cHe [Joshua] learnt his lesson and just got sick and tired of people talking shit,\u201d Hearn said . \u201cIt\u2019s not about Tyson Fury. We talked for ages about [Deontay] Wilder, and Wilder tried to make AJ look like he didn\u2019t want to fight. AJ is saying he will fight whoever you put in front of him.\u201d Even when reminded that nothing is certain in boxing\u2019s chaotic business, Hearn said: \u201cThe only hitch I can think of is Wilder. If the court orders a rematch [after Fury knocked out Wilder last February], and it doesn\u2019t sound as though they will, then it\u2019s out of our hands. That\u2019s the only way it falls through \u2013 if something stops Fury\u2019s side. \u201cThat isn\u2019t me saying they don\u2019t want it. They do. But Bob Arum [Fury\u2019s American promoter] seems very confident Wilder-Fury is not on. Unless he has made a complete balls-up, it sounds like that fight is dead.\u201d \u201cI know what my job is, I am under instructions to make that fight. AJ will not shout: \u2018You big dosser\u2019 and do Instagram posts because it is not his style.\u201d Hearn was equally optimistic there would be no problems with television rights for a fight that should generate more than \u00a3200m. \u201cIt\u2019s quite easy because the worst-case scenario is everyone shares it. Everyone will do that anyway as we need to maximise the revenue for the fighters,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the UK, AJ has an exclusive deal with Sky, Fury a matching deal with BT. In America, Fury has an exclusive deal with ESPN and AJ a matching deal with DAZN. I can\u2019t talk on behalf of Sky but they probably feel comfortable they will get the majority of buys.\u201d Asked how long it may take to confirm the fight, Hearn said: \u201cCouple of days. There\u2019s no reason we cannot complete the deal. We\u2019re all in and what we should be doing is finalising it. The only thing that needs to be resolved is where it is going to be and a couple of TV issues. That is it. \u201cEveryone is completely in on the finances. We need to write to the governing bodies and say we have a deal and we will now talk to the various sites and confirm the dates shortly for what I suppose will be the end of May.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
