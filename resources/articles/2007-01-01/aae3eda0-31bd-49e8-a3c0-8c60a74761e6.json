What's more, reports the hon member for North Devon, the cost of this operation was a mere \u00a357,800 plus VAT! A small price to pay, we feel, for ensuring our elected representatives - even, much though it pains us to say it, Fatty Soames - are not denied the fundamental right to sup without fear of being rudely deposited on their well-upholstered rears. We must, though, take issue with that otherwise most entertaining of Daily Mail columnists, Allison Pearson, who laid into charming Jade Goody's mum, Jackiey, something rotten in Wednesday's paper, essentially on the grounds that she was the kind of woman who \"can't even spell her name right\". Leaving aside such grammatical niceties of the English language as the proper use of the adverb, this seems to us to be more than a little unjust from a woman who spells Alison with two Ls. In important late-breaking genital news, meanwhile, we're relieved to learn from the excellent Maxnews website that Romanian surgeon Naum Ciomu, who admitted losing his temper during an operation to correct a testicular malformation, cutting off his patient's penis, and chopping it into pieces, has had his licence to practise suspended. Thank heavens for that. Returning to the very real attractions of reality television, it seems only right to remind our culture secretary, Tessa Jowell, that, on GMTV barely two years ago, she stoutly defended BB and its offspring as legitimately falling \"within the remit of public-service broadcasting\". Bless. None the less, did Tess really deserve the barrage of boos she received in the Strangers' Dining Room the other night merely for speaking of her love for Arsenal Football Club in general, and striker Thierry Henry in particular? Frankly, we think not. Mind you, the chairs were definitely not new and the canapes tasted like flannel. Ugh. Well there's a coincidence! Who's that on a poster for the Indian branch of animal-rights group Peta, dressed in tiger stripes and staring sadly out from behind the bars of a circus cage above the oh-so-eloquent caption \"Beaten, lonely and abused\"? Reader, we fear it is Shilpa Shetty. We are deluged with further examples of the electrifying prose of Alexis Rowell, the Camden Lib Dem councillor fast emerging as a shining new star of the blogosphere. \"So what did you do at the weekend?\" he asks in one pearl. \"Personally, I spent it cutting up old clothes and creating new things to wear. Another great example of recycling. All you need is a pile of old garments, some ideas, some time and, preferably, a friend or a mum who's a whizz on a sewing machine.\" Why have we not heard more of this man? Overheard at yesterday's Unison conference, Ed Miliband, junior brother to David, former junior minister at the Treasury and now \"minister for the third sector\", relating how, as a man well used to playing second fiddle, he felt he had come of age when Tony Woodley, TGWU head honcho, shouldered his way across a crowded room to say a few words to him. And they were? \"Um, David, I just wanted to apologise for calling you Ed earlier.\" Arf. Far too much CBB, we know. But we can't let it drop without marvelling at the heartwarming expressions of support pouring in to dear Jade Goody's website forums from all over the world. \"Members of the Southern Dakota Neo-Nazi Movement would like to offer their congratulations to Miss Goody for her bravery in saying what needed to be said,\" notes one, while nearer to home a certain Norris McSquirter adds: \"We too, at the BNP, would like to offer Miss Goody our sincerest support.\" Fine work, one and all! diary@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
