I can no longer fit into a cowslip's bell, but the general theory is sound. It's a sip (or a suck) here and a nibble there, along with chats with the folk who grow or pick or make or sell or something. I come across shops that do a special job, too. Here are five that have given me particular pleasure: William's Kitchen It is a wonder to find a cracking good fishmonger so far from the sea. In fact, you'd be hard pressed to find fish as good slap-bang on the beach. And I love William's Kitchen in particular because its proprietor, William Beeston, is a man of fishy passions. He can't resist putting the odd mega-fish on display - fish of the quality that normally turn up only in restaurants. The other day he had a John Dory the size of a buckler beside a sea bass the length of a cricket bat. It was all I could do not to buy both. There's plenty of non-fishy stuff, too, plus an oyster bar for lunchtime snacks and a proper restaurant on Friday and Saturday evenings. Hurrah for Nailsworth. Ibbotson's I came across Ibbotson's quite by accident. It's a kind of dream village shop: small and so packed with produce that you can hardly turn around without sending a packet of biscuits or a display of chocolates crashing to the floor. But they are local biscuits and chocolate, to go alongside the local pies, pasties, fruit and veg. Not to mention their very own, prestige-class pickled onions. It's not all bespoke local stuff, though. \"Have you got any taleggio?\" I heard one customer ask. \"No, but the reblochon's just right,\" said the ebullient Katheryn, who owns and runs the place with her husband, Ken (and Karen and Wendy and Di and Jenny). What with Harrogate toffee, mint humbugs, butter and cream from the Peak District, Raineri olive oil and Seggiano raw artichoke paste, there's something for everyone. Gabriel Machin When I visit my mother in Henley, I often pop to Waitrose to replenish her fridge and store cupboard, and then, having bought the boring essentials, indulge myself by sauntering along to Gabriel Machin, the town's last surviving butcher, purveyor of top-grade local meats, game, fish and, above all, smoked products. Rarely do I leave without a packet of bacon, some salmon, eel, halibut and other goodies, all lovingly cured out the back. The Gazzano's I was rather concerned a few years back when Gazzano metamorphosed from a crowded, pleasantly old-fashioned Italian deli into a modish, iron-clad Italian deli. Would it lose its heart and soul, and, more important, the uniform high standard of its salumi, cheese, bread and oil, and the charm with which they were served. I need not have worried. Gazzano's has served the Italian community in London for more than 100 years. The latest generation have given the family business new impetus without losing the professionalism and warmth of past generations. The secret is to have a large enough turnover to make sure all the produce is fresh. Valvona &amp; Crolla Does V&amp;C need any further rave notices? It has been an Edinburgh institution for so long, but, well, why not. I was reminded just how fabulous this shop would be anywhere in the world when I went for a book signing the other day. Impeccable produce, sourced with a very keen palate, displayed with unnerving generosity, genial service, fabulous wine section, zippy cafe - this place is the dog's family jewels when it comes to food shopping."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
