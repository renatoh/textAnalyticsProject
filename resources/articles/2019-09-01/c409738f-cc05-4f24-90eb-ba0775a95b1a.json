Britain\u2019s accountancy regulator, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), said it was considering the case for investigation and enforcement action \u201cas a matter of urgency\u201d, while MPs on the business select committee said there were \u201cserious questions to answer\u201d about how the firm was run. The government has already announced a fast-track inquiry into the collapse by the Insolvency Service, which is charged with closing down the 178-year-old holiday business. Potential concerns for the FRC include the extent of \u201cexceptional items\u201d on the company\u2019s balance sheet, which could have swayed investors and affected annual results \u2013 as well as the profit-related bonuses paid to directors. Thomas Cook was audited by two of the UK\u2019s biggest accountancy firms, with EY succeeding PwC from 2017. The tour operator had a series of finance chiefs over the past two years. The pay of the last three chief executives of Thomas Cook has come under increased scrutiny. Labour\u2019s John McDonnell has urged the former bosses to repay their bonuses while the Confederation of British Industry said \u201cquestions are now rightly being asked\u201d about the \u00a335m paid out over the past 12 years to Manny Fontenla-Novoa, Harriet Green and Peter Fankhauser.... More here: More evidence of problems in Cuba tonight, from a Thomas Cook air hostess: More information from Cuba, where hoteliers don\u2019t appear to believe the UK authorities will cover bills.... Here\u2019s the ambassador again: Sounds like Condor has its rescue loan: Here\u2019s our latest story about the Thomas Cook staff who\u2019ve lost their jobs: Now this is worrying. Several people have contacted the UK Embassy in Cuba, saying they or their parents are holidaying with Thomas Cook -- and have been ordered to pay massive bills, running into thousands of pounds in some cases. The embassy says it is aware of the problem, and confirmed that hotels should get the money they\u2019re owed through the ATOL protection scheme - not from individual holidaymakers. The UK ambassador in Cuba (Our Man in Havana) says the embassy is working hard to help.... Some readers have written in to argue that the government should have kept Thomas Cook afloat. Tom Jackson of Stockport, Greater Manchester, says the bill would have been tiny, compared to the cost of the financial crisis rescue package: When the Royal Bank of Scotland experienced financial meltdown during the 2007-8 financial crisis Gordon Brown came to the rescue with \u00a346bn government support, claiming that RBS was too big to fail. It\u2019s ironic that this bank requested its customer, Thomas Cook, to seek \u00a3200m to avoid administration and is now responsible for its demise, along with those who ran the travel company and the government. Another old established company bites the dust. But Polly Bird of Bedlington, Northumberland, argues that Thomas Cook customers are getting decent treatment compared to other people who get caught up in travel chaos. We live in strange times. UK holidaymakers were left stranded by holiday company Thomas Cook and the government rushed to organise planes to bring them home (Ministers \u2018scuppered Thomas Cook deal\u2019, 24 September). UK citizens were left traumatised in adverse conditions having survived hurricane Irma and the government left them struggling to make their own ways home. One Thomas Cook holidaymaker in Corfu tweets that Operation Matterhorn isn\u2019t going too smoothly. Her flight home was cancelled on Monday, then the next one was full, so after spending all day at the airport they were sent to a hotel. There was no flight today, so they\u2019ll have to see what happens tomorrow: Reuters is reporting that Germany\u2019s government has decided to give Condor, Thomas Cook\u2019s German airline, a bridge loan. The loan, in partnership with the state of Hesse, could be worth almost \u20ac400m, and would would allow Condor to keep operating. Quite a contrast with London\u2019s refusal to bail out Thomas Cook; the difference, though, is that Condor is profitable rather than insolvent. The Unite union has called for \u201cradical reform\u201d of financial regulation in the UK, following the Thomas Cook crisis. Unite also hit out at the government for announcing a probe into the company - arguing it\u2019s simply too late for staff who\u2019ve lost their jobs. Unite assistant general secretary Diana Holland says the current system is broken: \u201cThe thousands of workers who yesterday lost their jobs, and the hundreds of thousands of people who had their holidays cancelled, will draw no comfort from the announcement of a probe by the Official Receiver. \u201cYet again the Government is guilty of being asleep at the wheel. It failed to learn the lessons from Carillion\u2019s collapse. If the Government had done so, the collapse of Thomas Cook may have been avoided. \u201cThe UK financial regulatory system is broken and without proper checks and balances, we have no idea if other Thomas Cooks and Carillions are in the pipeline and no ability to prevent them from occurring. \u201cThe collapse of Thomas Cook has not been allowed to happen in other countries as their governments and regulators have mechanisms to stop such a disastrous and immediate collapse as has happened in the UK. \u201cRadical reform of the UK\u2019s financial regulatory system must be an absolute priority to prevent other workers in the future being dumped on the scrapheap without warning, through absolutely no fault of their own.\u201d Money Saving Expert, the consumer finance site, reports that some people who\u2019d booked holidays with Thomas Cook have received refunds. Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, says the \u201cchargeback system\u201d, which lets customers reverse a credit card payment, is working. \u201cThe news that people are starting to get payouts should start to allow those people who\u2019ve booked with Thomas Cook and have been holding their breath over the weekend at the panicked thought of lost money to breathe a sigh of relief. \u201cIt\u2019s still early days but at least this shows that attitude-wise, the system is working. Most people will be getting their money back through the ATOL scheme, but those who aren\u2019t getting their money back through that and who paid on plastic we\u2019re now seeing get these chargeback payouts from their card providers. Sky News have also interviewed a Thomas Cook cabin crew worker about the moment they heard the company had gone under - and it\u2019s an emotional read. Julie Burns told Sky: I was on a flight when we found out that we were losing our jobs. I was positioned out to Newcastle for four days and we\u2019d been coming back from Antalya. Before the flight, one of the girls had her phone on so we could see Thomas Cook\u2019s chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, coming out of a meeting and at the time it seemed positive. We were all a little upbeat, although we had got on the flight not knowing if we were going to be paid for it. The most heartbreaking thing is that the passengers knew what had happened before we did. When we landed, they had their phones on and they saw the news. After all the passengers had got off, the senior flight attendant came up and she went, \u201cThat\u2019s it guys, game over\u201d. I said \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d and she said \u201cIt\u2019s over, we\u2019re finished\u201d. We all started crying and were really upset... The full piece is online, here. Newsflash: It\u2019s all gone wrong for Northern Ireland bus-maker Wrightbus. Sky News is reporting that Wrightbus, maker of London\u2019s \u2018Boris Bus\u2019, will fall into administration on Wednesday. Deloitte are expected to be appointed as administrators, putting 1,300 jobs at risk. Sky\u2019s Mark Kleinman says: Sources close to one of the bidders said on Tuesday evening that the appointment of Deloitte was \u201calmost certain\u201d to happen within 24 hours, putting about 1300 jobs at risk. The news will represent a devastating blow to Northern Ireland\u2019s manufacturing sector, with the prospects of Wrightbus being salvaged in its current form now understood to be remote The move means Wrightbus failed in a last-minute dash to find a buyer, following weeks of talks. Thanks to the un-prorogation of parliament, the government could face an urgent question on the collapse of Thomas Cook tomorrow. This is good advice: Thomas Cook holidaymakers: Here\u2019s what to do if your hotel hits you with an unexpected bill... The Press Association have also spoken with Thomas Cook customers whose hotel demanded they hand over money - even though they\u2019re protected by the ATOL scheme. Liam Archer and his partner Ciara Edwards, both from Gloucestershire, were asked by staff at their hotel on Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands to pay the equivalent of more than \u00a3800 to secure their Thomas Cook booking. Mr Archer told the PA news agency: \u201cWe had a note through our door asking us to go to reception. We were then told we had one hour to pay 942 euro otherwise we would have been kicked out of the hotel. \u201cWe rang the CAA and they told us to pay and keep receipts. Very stressful as we have had to ring around to find the money.\u201d Time for a recap Pressure is building on Thomas Cook\u2019s management and auditors after the holiday firm collapsed under a mountain of debt on Monday. Parliament\u2019s business committee has pledged to examine what went wrong. Rachel Reeves MP says there are \u201cserious questions to answer, including about the company\u2019s accounting practices, its renumeration policy and practice, and about the stewardship of the company.\u201d The Financial Reporting Council (which monitors the accountancy and auditing professions) is pondering whether to launch an \u201curgent\u201d inquiry. Such investigations could examine how Thomas Cook paid around \u00a335m to its last three CEOs over the last 12 years, and whether its accounts were fully open and transparent. Business secretary Andrea Leadsom also piled pressure onto directors, saying the Insolvency Service needs to get to the bottom of the situation. The CBI agrees. The warnings came on the second day of Operation Matterhorn, which is repatriating the 160,000 people who were holidaying with Thomas Cook when it fell into liquidation. The Civil Aviation Authority was planning to bring over 16,00 people back to the UK today, having repatriated nearly 15,000 on Monday. The CAA said the operation was going pretty well, although not without some hurdles. Some flights have been delayed, while others are returning passengers to Manchester rather than their intended destinations (such as Newcastle or Gatwick). Thomas Cook customers have also faced demands from hotels to pay bills, despite having already stumped up for their holidays. One told the Guardian that notes were pushed under their doors (photo here), showing how much they had to pay. Customers have also been warned not to fall victim to fraudsters, who may claim to be calling from Thomas Cook with a refund. Rival holiday firm TUI, has been forced to cancel some holidays too, having booked its customers onto Thomas Cook flights. Anger is building against airlines and holiday firms for hiking their prices, as disappointed Thomas Cook customers try to find alternative flights. The BBC have also spoken to Thomas Cook customers who\u2019ve been told to pay for their hotel rooms, despite having already paid for their holidays (a problem we flagged up earlier) Here\u2019s a flavour: Jess Beeton, on holiday with her partner Richard Berrington, said \u201ceveryone who booked through Thomas Cook has been locked out of the rooms\u201d. She added: \u201cThe only option we were given was to pay what Thomas Cook hasn\u2019t, or get our stuff and leave.\u201d Jess said that after the hotel locked them out, she managed to gain access to their room by saying she had medication there that she needed to take. Once inside, she and Richard locked themselves in, but they have since paid \u00a3520 on a credit card so they can stay at the hotel until their due departure date from Spain on Sunday. Thomas Cook\u2019s bosses, directors and auditors have just been warned that they could be hauled to Westminster to explain themselves. Rachel Reeves MP, chair of the BEIS Committee, says parliament wants answers about why the company collapsed, who made mistakes, and how bosses were paid so much for running the firm. \u201cThe public will be rightly appalled that as Thomas Cook mounted up debt and as the company headed for trouble, company bosses were happily pocketing hefty pay-packages. Now, in the aftermath of the company\u2019s collapse, as frustrated travellers are stuck abroad, when holidays are being cancelled and thousands of staff are losing their jobs, there are serious questions to answer, including about the company\u2019s accounting practices, its renumeration policy and practice, and about the stewardship of the company. As a Committee, we are keen to seek answers to these questions and will discuss at the next meeting how we can do that.\u201d Football clubs have offering help to supporters who bought travel packages to games through Thomas Cook\u2019s sports arm. Chelsea has pledged to cover the costs for fans who booked travel with Thomas Cook to Lille or Southampton, and who now need to rebook. Liverpool says it is trying to help supporters who\u2019d bought packages through collapsed Thomas Cook for their next two home games -- against FC Salzburg in the Champions League, and the Premier League fixture against Leicester. Thomas Cook customers have been warned not to fall for fraudsters, who may try to trick them out of their bank details. Barclays Bank has warned people to be on their guard, in case a scammer phones up pretending to be able to help with rebooking a flight. The Take Five campaign to raise fraud awareness also has some advice, including Don\u2019t automatically click on a link in an email or message Be sceptical if you get an unsolicited call Contact your bank using the number or address they supply One Twitter user flags up that people are being targeted: People who booked holidays through travel giant TUI are now caught up in Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse. TUI, who are Europe\u2019s biggest tour operator, had used Thomas Cook Airlines to fly some of its customers to and from their destinations. It has now decided to cancel all such holidays, up until the end of October. In a statement, TUI says: We\u2019ve unfortunately had to cancel any TUI and First Choice bookings featuring Thomas Cook flights for any customers due to travel from Monday 23rd September until 31st October 2019. The advice is not to travel to the airport. We will be organising full holiday refunds for these customers and will process these as quickly as possible. For any TUI and First Choice customers with Thomas Cook flights due to travel after this date, please bear with us as we look at other options and alternatives for you as a priority. We are working hard to help affected customers find alternative holidays, so we will do everything we can to help in these extraordinary circumstances. As we mentioned earlier today, TUI is also pledging to fly home any customers who are already on holiday, and had been scheduled to return on a Thomas Cook flight: Glasgow Airport has just detained four of Thomas Cook\u2019s aeroplanes, as \u2018security\u2019 for the money it is owed by the company, reports the BBC\u2019s Connor Gillies. The last Thomas Cook flight landed in Glasgow early yesterday morning, from Orlando in Florida, a few hours after the company went into liquidations. Scheduled departures from Glasgow were then suspended, as at other UK airports. Airports owed landing fees by Thomas Cook will presumably be joining the ranks of creditors, who must file claims with the Insolvency Service. Spain\u2019s acting tourism minister has said there are 53,000 British tourists currently travelling with Thomas Cook at Spanish resorts. Reyes Maroto also told reporters in Madrid that her ministry has been in touch with German and Swedish authorities to ensure Thomas Cook subsidiaries continue to operate at least for the winter season, Reuters reports. Maroto also chaired a meeting with regional tourism ministers from Canary Islands, Balearic Islands, Valencia, Catalonia and Andalusia and delegates of main Spanish touristic employers\u2019 organizations to evaluate the impact of the collapse of Thomas Cook today. Here\u2019s one of the notes pushed under the doors of Thomas Cook holidaymakers in Mallorca, asking them to pay bills owed by the company (see earlier post). Here\u2019s a couple more photos of Thomas Cook customers trying to get home today: t One Thomas Cook holiday maker describes the situation in his hotel as a \u2018giant self-help group\u2019 after guests were forced to sort out payment issues in the absence of any official help. Reriree Robert Rowe, 67, his wife Maria are staying at Hotel More, a family run hotel in Alcudia town in Mallorca. Rowe said that all hotel guests who were on Thomas Cook packages had notes put under their door on Monday morning asking them for money. He contacted CAA and was told that they were Atol protected and shouldn\u2019t pay the hotel. However many guests were unsure about what to do, he says (via our callout) \u201c95% are people here are pensioners and only a few people can use smartphones and people weren\u2019t getting information as there were no reps around.\u201d \u201cThe hotel manager had asked for people\u2019s bank details. It was very emotional, people were upset. Some guests were trying to sort it out and pass on the information from CAA. It was like a giant self-help group.\u201d Rowe said twenty or thirty guests held an impromptu meeting on Tuesday morning and reiterated that nobody should pay. \u201c The hotel management haven\u2019t asked for any more money. We\u2019re laying low, we have four more days here. I feel sorry for them in a way because they\u2019re a small family run hotel and it seems bad that Thomas Cook have put small traders in this position. But I think the way they handled it was poor. \u201cI come from Melbourne in Derbyshire, where Thomas Cook started. There\u2019s Thomas Cook Close, Thomas Cook Gardens and Thomas Cook almshouses. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to be called now.\u201d A lot of people face losses because of Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse. The companies suppliers could be left with unpaid bills, while employees need to submit claims to obtain the redundancy payments and wages they\u2019re entitled to. The Insolvency Service has more details here. Here\u2019s our news story about the accountancy watchdog sniffing around Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse: The Confederation of British Industry has backed calls for a probe into the \u201cfat cat\u201d pay at Thomas Cook. Josh Hardie, deputy director-general at the CBI, says (via the Evening Standard). Questions are now rightly being asked about directors\u2019 remuneration and decision-making. Disproportionate rewards are a lightning rod for public discontent, so high pay can only ever be justified by high performance over the long term. The CBI represents Britain\u2019s bosses, so won\u2019t have enjoyed headlines about \u201cfat cats creaming off \u00a347m\u201d. Holidaymakers are sharing their stories of further difficulties as they try and return to the UK (through our callout to readers). Nikita Locke, 22 was on a Thomas Cook package holiday at the SunConnect One hotel in Monastir, Tunisia with her sister Shannon and two young children. They were supposed to be taken by coach organised by the hotel to Enfidha\u2013Hammamet airport on Tuesday but were advised by the hotel to book their own taxi seven hours before their 1015 flight to Birmingham was due to depart, in case of disruption. They paid 120 Tunisian Dinar, about \u00a333.50, for the taxi in advance and were given a receipt by hotel staff but when the taxi arrived the driver claimed he hadn\u2019t been paid by the hotel and demanded more money. Locke said: \u201cIt was 3am and we had the two kids screaming and crying, standing outside the hotel. My sister and I were so stressed wondering if we were going to make it to the airport. I just refused to pay out any more money.\u201d The hotel finally paid the driver 45 minutes later, and the family were taken to the airport. Their flight was due to depart at 10.15 am, but it\u2019s now scheduled to leave at 1.20pm. Reminder: you can shares your experiences here. In Crete, authorities say eight UK-bound flights have been chartered to fly Thomas Cook customers back home today. Some 20,000 Britons have been stranded on the island which has borne the brunt of the fallout in Greece of Thomas Cook\u2019s bankruptcy. Two planes are scheduled to fly to Gatwick, two to Manchester with the rest slated to fly to Newcastle, Birmingham, Glasgow and Bristol. Around 50,000 Thomas Cook customers have been marooned nationwide. Greece, already hard hit by its long-running debt crisis, has been hugely affected by the tour company\u2019s collapse with the country\u2019s tourism confederation estimating today that damages could reach \u20ac500m (up from initial estimates of \u20ac300m). On Tuesday Haris Theoharis, the tourism minister, said the firm owed outstanding payments from mid-July to hotels and other businesses. As the engine of the Greek economy, the tourism industry contributes around a quarter of total economic output, employing an ever growing number of people \u2013 at last count one in five. Relief measures are being considered by the centre right government once total damages are calculated. Following an urgent meeting of tourism and finance ministers last night it emerged that tax cuts are among the measures being considered for enterprises worst affected by the tour operator\u2019s liquidation. The Financial Reporting Council\u2019s job is to \u201cpromote transparency and integrity in business\u201d. That means upholding standards for accounting and actuarial work, and ensuring that corporate reporting and auditing is up to scratch. If it does probe Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse, as it\u2019s threatening, the FRC could examine two issues 1) Thomas Cook\u2019s use of one-off charges. The company was a keen user of \u2018exceptional items\u2019 -- stripping certain costs out of its financial results. That\u2019s perfectly above board in principle, if it gives the City a better view of the underlying business. But it can be abused - which is why auditors need to ensure one-off items really are unusual. 2) Goodwill write-downs. Back in May, Thomas Cook took a \u00a31bn impairment charge relating to its 2007 merger with MyTravel. Thomas Cook said it had to revalue the deal \u201cin light of the weak trading environment\u201d -- but you could ask why it took 12 years to conclude it overpaid. Ben Martin has written a good piece about this in today\u2019s Times, here. He points out that EY took over as Thomas Cook\u2019s auditors in 2017, from PWC, and \u201cstrongly recommended\u201d strengthening its procedures. Newsflash! Britain\u2019s accountancy regulator has announced it could launch an urgent probe into the collapse of Thomas Cook yesterday. The Financial Reporting Council says: \u201cIn light of recent developments at Thomas Cook we are considering whether there is any case for investigation and enforcement action as a matter of urgency and in cooperation with the Insolvency Service.\u201d That follows the government\u2019s decision to fast-track the Insolvency Services\u2019s inquiry into why Thomas Cook fell into insolvency. This is odd. The departures board at Palma Airport is now showing that all the Thomas Cook repatriation flights are delayed until 1am! My colleague Sam Jones has sent this photo of the flights board. It shows that flights to Stansted, Bristol, Manchester, Birmingham, Newcastle, Gatwick, East Midlands and Cardiff have all been pushed back beyond midnight, rather than leaving this morning. However, the CAA website suggests most of the flights were leaving on time, so perhaps this is an error? Sam also reports that the airport is busy, but not as hectic as yesterday. There are FCO staff on the ground, but they\u2019re not allowed to talk to the press. So it\u2019s a confusing picture.... Thomas Cook staff, meanwhile, have been turning up for work despite not knowing if they\u2019ll even get paid. Here\u2019s the latest on Thomas Cook, from Associated Press: The British government has flown home the first 14,500 people stranded by the collapse of tour operator Thomas Cook, and is expected to ramp up the repatriation effort to get all the 150,000 U.K.-based customers home in two weeks. The Civil Aviation Authority said Tuesday the first batch of people were flown back after Thomas Cook ceased all operations Monday, leaving hundreds of thousands stranded around the world. It was still unclear how many of the 600,000 total that were traveling with the company as of Sunday would remain stranded. German authorities were still mulling a request for a bridging loan from airline Condor, a subsidiary of Thomas Cook. The company\u2019s Dutch subsidiary said all flights scheduled for Tuesday were scrapped and customers won\u2019t be able to use accommodation they booked. Despite yesterday\u2019s collapse, Thomas Cook workers have been turning up to work today. They\u2019ll be assisting the Official Receiver, which was appointed to liquidate the company on Monday. Back in the markets, sterling is lurching around after the Supreme Court dramatically ruled against Boris Johnson, over the prorogation of parliament. In a seismic ruling, the UK\u2019s top judges have concluded that the suspension of parliament was \u2018unlawful, void and of no effect\u2019. This sent the pound rocketing back towards $1.25 (a level hit last week), before subsiding back as traders wondered what happens next. Opposition MPs are calling for Johnson\u2019s resignation, as they digest the details of a stinging ruling from the Supreme Court: Labour MP Justin Madders has hit out at travel companies who have hiked their prices following Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse. He says a constituent is facing a 500% price hike to reschedule their honeymoon to Mexico. Obviously there is a supply-and-demand issue at present, but companies should be wary of price-gouging.... Sam Jones, who is in Mallorca, has this update on flights from Palma airport. Eight flights are due to bring Thomas Cook customers home to the UK from Palma airport in Mallorca today. Some have been rerouted, while others are set to leave as previously scheduled: The 10.25 to Stansted is currently set to take off as originally planned, as is the 10.35 to Bristol, the 10.45 to Manchester, the 11.10 to East Midlands, and the 11.30 to Cardiff. The 11am flight from Palma to Gatwick is due to take off 15 minutes early, but will now land at Manchester. The 10.50 to Birmingham has been pushed back to 20.15 and will now land in Manchester. The 11am Palma-Newcastle flight has also been pushed back to 20.15 and will land in Manchester as well. The CAA says transfers will be provided to all those landing at rescheduled destinations. In other transport news, Uber has just been denied a new permanent licence to operate in London. Instead, Transport for London has instead given the ride-hailing firm only a two-month extension to its licence, which is due to expire on Wednesday night. It is the second time in two years that TfL has rejected Uber\u2019s application for a full operating licence, following concerns it doesn\u2019t meet its \u201cfit and proper\u201d test. Here\u2019s the full story: Large queues are forming at Reus Airport near Tarragona, in Spain. But there\u2019s good news for passengers -- the CAA expects to replace all three scheduled Thomas Cook flights, on time, today. Large queues are forming at Mallorca airport in Parma, as Thomas Cook customers try to get onto one of today\u2019s eight repatriation flights: British government officials are there to help, wearing bright yellow high-visibility vests: Business secretary Andrea Leadsom has claimed it would have been a \u201cwaste of taxpayers\u2019 money\u201d to have bailed out Thomas Cook. Speaking on Sky News, Leadsom says the company\u2019s collapse is \u201cincredibly sad\u201d. She\u2019s \u201cso sorry\u201d for those who have lost their jobs or why are trying to get home. We want to look into how this happened, which is why the Insolvency Service has been asked to fast-track its usual investigation into its directors, to see if anything could have been done differently to \u201cavert this disaster\u201d, Leadsom continues. Q: There\u2019s a backlash against the pay received by Thomas Cook\u2019s bosses. Do you and the PM now favour restricting pay and bonuses? Leadsom says the government is \u201cconcerned to understand\u201d how a business could build up a huge amount of debt, leaving it teetering for some time, with a business model that doesn\u2019t seem to meet customer needs. I do want to see what the Insolvency Service has to say about the events leading to the collapse of Thomas Cook. Leadsom adds that we must \u201cdo more to align directors\u2019 pay to performance\u201d. There\u2019s lots we can do, but the situation is already better than a decade ago. Q: Isn\u2019t this just posturing? These companies are pursuing the free market policies the Conservative Party supports. We\u2019ve done a huge amount on corporate government already to make boards more accountable, Leadsom hits back. Directors of boards who are earning significant sums need to be accountable for the performance of the businesses they run We will look to see what more needs to be done to make them accountable. But... these will need consultation, before any legislation is drawn up. These things take time, and the government doesn\u2019t want to hurt businesses. Q: What about these reports that Turkish and Spanish governments were ready to step in with \u00a3200m, but UK refused to provide guarantees to underwrite the funding? There are all sorts of rumours flying around, says Leadsom. The fact is that \u00a3200m is an underestimate of what TC needed, even for the short term, she claims, adding: It would have been a waste of taxpayers\u2019 money to throw good money after bad. This is a very sad case, she concludes. As a reminder.... Thomas Cook was trying to execute a recovery plan that would have wiped out \u00a31.7bn of existing debts and injected an extra \u00a3900m of new funding into the company -- half from Chinese tourism business Fosun, the rest by a mixture of banks and hedge funds . That plan floundered when lenders asked for an extra \u00a3200m to tide the company over. The row over Thomas Cook\u2019s \u2018fat cat\u2019 pay dominated today\u2019s newspapers, from across the spectrum. The Daily Mail reckons senior bosses at Thomas Cook \u201cpocketed a \u00a347million pay bonanza as the firm headed for the rocks\u201d. That includes the \u00a336m paid to its three CEOs since 2007 (as we reported overnight), plus millions more to other officials The Mirror has also taken a swipe at the \u201cgreedy bosses\u201d, with shadow chancellor John McDonnell saying: They have a moral responsibility to return their bonuses. They created this mess and there are large numbers of people losing their jobs. [Bosses] should hand the money back to compensate those workers.\u201d The Financial Times says those executives can expect scrutiny: Thomas Cook\u2019s management will be investigated by a UK government-backed probe into the travel group\u2019s collapse, as holidaymakers flooded international airports on Monday to queue for rescue flights. The full cost of the demise of the world\u2019s oldest tour operator is still being assessed by restructuring specialists AlixPartners, with investors lining up to cherry-pick the best parts of its pan-European operations after the failure of last-ditch talks to secure a \u00a31.1bn rescue deal. The Times leads on Boris Johnson\u2019s criticism of Thomas Cook\u2019s management, questioning whether they should receive such huge packages when a firm can go \u2018down the tubes\u2019. Nearly 1,000 British tourists left Turkey\u2019s southwestern Mugla province yesterday, following Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse. Many left after nightfall,and were clearly pleased to be heading home. An additional 3,000 tourists are expected to leave today. The boss of travel company Tui said it would fly home Tui customers who are booked on Thomas Cook flights. Friedrich Joussen, the chief executive, told shareholders this morning: Tui is preparing measures to support. Where Tui customers are booked on Thomas Cook Airlines flights and these are no longer operated, replacement flights will be offered. \u201cWe are currently assessing the short term impact of Thomas Cook\u2019s insolvency under the current circumstances, on the final week of our 2019 financial result. Tui also warned that the market remained tough due to the grounding of 737 Max aircraft, airline overcapacity and continued Brexit uncertainty. Shares in TUI have jumped 1.4% in early trading, having surged 7% on Monday. Thomas Cook\u2019s collapse should let TUI win more business, and potentially push up prices too. Over at Palma airport, the CAA is planning to run eight flights back to the UK. Two of them, though, are scheduled to leave around nine hours late, meaning passengers face a grim day at the airport. They\u2019ll both also land at Manchester, not Birmingham and Newcastle as expected \u2013- meaning passengers will be put onto a coach and transferred to their original destination. The boss of the Civil Aviation Authority says Operation Matterhorn, the repatriation of Thomas Cook customers, has had some difficulties - but overall is going well. Speaking on BBBC Breakfast, Dame Deirdre Hutton said: \u201cIt\u2019s a two-week operation, that\u2019s mainly because people go on holiday for two weeks, so we want everybody to continue to enjoy their holidays and we\u2019ll bring them back on the day they were going to come back anyway.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m really pleased that the first day went well, we got back 95% of those we were intending. There were some operational difficulties and we\u2019ll continue to have that ... there\u2019ll be some bumps in the road and if people could bear with us, but we have got off to a reasonable start which is very good.\u201d There\u2019s nobody abroad who should have been home. We\u2019re bringing people back when their holiday ends, so we\u2019ve got another 135,000 people to bring....We\u2019ve done 8% so far, we\u2019ve got 13 days to go, so it\u2019s still a big operation.\u201d We heard yesterday that around 30 holidaymakers in Tunisia were sent back to their hotels, because there wasn\u2019t enough space for them on the repatriation flight. There were also long queues and delays at airports such as Mah\u00f3n, Menorca and Palma, Mallorca, in the Balearic Islands. The Civil Aviation Authority has just announced that it brought 14,700 Thomas Cook customers back to the UK on Monday. It is planning to run another 74 flights today, which should transport another 16,800 passengers at the end of their holidays. However, some passengers will not be landing where they expected. For example, flight MT1217 was due to land at Gatwick, but is instead being sent to Manchester. That means a long coach ride down to London to complete the journey. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The management of Thomas Cook are facing serious questions over the pay today, after the world\u2019s oldest tour operator collapsed \u2013 triggering Britain\u2019s biggest ever peacetime repatriation. As the first planes brought thousands of holidaymakers back to the UK, with heavy delays at some airports, accusations of \u201cfat cat\u201d incompetence rained down on the company. Boris Johnson led the criticism, questioning why business leaders get away with paying themselves \u201clarge sums of money\u201d as their business goes \u201cdown the tubes\u201d. Speaking in New York, at the UN climate summit, the PM said: \u201cI think it is a bit bewildering that you can have 160,000 people stranded. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible for me to know exactly what happened with the directors of the board of Thomas Cook and how it came about when they paid themselves x, y or z. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to have a system in the future whereby we make sure that tour operators are in some way prevented from simply going belly up and then requiring the taxpayer to bring everybody home.\u201d Estimates vary, but we\u2019ve calculated that the three executives who led Thomas Cook over the last 12 years earned around \u00a335m between them. Manny Fontenla-Novoa, who led the acquisition spree that saddled the company with more than \u00a31bn of debt, was handed more than \u00a317m in just over four years as boss of Thomas Cook, boosted by bonuses awarded for slashing 2,800 jobs following the merger with MyTravel. He quit in 2011 as the tour operator came close to collapse. His successor was Harriet Green, who was paid \u00a34.7m for less than three years plus a share bonus worth a further \u00a35.6m. She handed a third of that award to charities after the deaths of two children from carbon monoxide poisoning in Thomas Cook accommodation in Corfu. Green also claimed \u00a380,000 a year to cover her hotel bills at the five-star Brown\u2019s hotel in London, where she lived during the week. Peter Fankhauser, who was in charge when the company collapsed, was handed \u00a38.3m, including \u00a34.3m in bonuses. The government has already ordered a probe into the firm\u2019s collapse, so the Insolvency Service will examine why Thomas Cook collapsed in a mountain of debt, and whether directors are to blame. Johnson and colleagues are also facing criticism, though, after refusing to help Thomas Cook by handing it a \u00a3200m lifeline. Some argue that this wouldn\u2019t have addressed the company\u2019s problems, but it appears to have scuppered rescue efforts led by Spain and Turkey. Meanwhile, Civil Aviation Authority staff will continue to mobilise planes to get Thomas Cook\u2019s customers home \u2013 with around 150,000 holidaymakers abroad yesterday when the firm sunk. They\u2019ve all been promised they\u2019ll be brought home, but it could be a tricky process \u2013 with plenty of delays and confusion reported yesterday. Also coming up today While Thomas Cook customers trudge home, City traders will be watching the supreme court which will rule whether Boris Johnson misled the Queen to suspend parliament.
