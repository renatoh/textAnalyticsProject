Second-half goals from El-Hadji Diouf and Jason Roberts lifted Blackburn out of the relegation zone and above Stoke into 15th place, meaning they can once again open the newspapers. \"You tell them they can't look at the papers, it's impossible not to see where you are,\" said Allardyce. \"It's in your face all the time and people always talk about relegation, relegation all the time when you're in that position, now we've relieved that a little bit.\" Informed of the original fixture's cancellation in January just two hours before kick-off, Blackburn fans had waited a long time for this match. Unfortunately they did not have to wait long to see their side concede. In the second minute Clint Dempsey turned on to a bobbling ball that caught Christopher Samba flat-footed. The American showed tremendous strength and honesty to stay on his feet with Ryan Nelsen dragging him back, before scuffing the ball beyond an advancing Paul Robinson with his left foot. Who says a formation needs to be balanced? Against Fulham, Blackburn's wide players, Morten Gamst Pedersen and El-Hadji Diouf, performed notably different roles. Pedersen hugged the touchline and fizzed crosses in, whereas Diouf roamed all over the pitch. The end result was a happy one: Diouf scored the first goal and Pedersen made the second. Andy Johnson and Simon Davies both had excellent opportunities to extend Fulham's lead before Blackburn began to resemble a diligently drilled Allardyce side. Their five-man midfield, with Tugay in a deeper role, left Fulham little scope to go forward and more and more of the game was played in the Fulham half. Previously imperious on the banks of the Thames, and just six points above the relegation zone, Roy Hodgson's side can ill afford to drift in and out of matches like this. Blackburn's unsophisticated game plan stumped Fulham and left Hodgson stroking his chin for much of the second period. His head may have been clasped in his hands when a long throw was not properly cleared and Tugay's header back into the area was nodded across the six-yard box by Jason Roberts, allowing Diouf the simplest of finishes. Then five minutes from the end Roberts turned the substitute Toni Kallio embarrassingly easily to drive past Schwarzer. Despite Fulham's relatively lofty league position Hodgson said he and his squad have never stopped looking over their shoulder. This defeat may result in collective whiplash for his small squad: \"We really do need a situation where we're playing one game a week, we've found it very, very hard,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
