At a hearing in Canberra on Thursday, the crown prosecutor revealed that despite being committed for trial two weeks ago, McBride is in the \u201cunusual position\u201d of not having the full brief because an agreement must first be reached about how to deal with \u201cnational security information\u201d in the case. McBride is facing five charges of leaking classified material to three senior journalists at the ABC and the then Fairfax Media newspapers, which formed the basis of \u201cThe Afghan Files\u201d, an ABC expose in 2017 revealing allegations of serious misconduct by Australian special forces in Afghanistan. McBride does not dispute leaking the material but will argue that he was acting on his duty to report illegal conduct by the government. Outside the court McBride complained that the case is \u201cnot about secrets, it\u2019s about lies\u201d. But inside the supreme court, where he is self-represented, McBride raised no objections to proposed orders to determine the bounds of national security information \u201cin chambers\u201d \u2013 in private with the judge \u2013 before he receives the full brief. Counsel for the attorney general said this would allow the case to proceed \u201cin a way that doesn\u2019t compromise security or defence\u201d. McBride told reporters that, despite being arrested nine months ago, he had not seen a full brief of evidence and claimed \u201cthat means they don\u2019t have a case against me yet\u201d. He explained he had not objected to a private determination on national security information because \u201cit may take forever for that side issue to run\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve decided that I have faith in the judiciary of this country and if it means we have to have a closed court I\u2019m prepared to have a closed court.\u201d McBride vowed that he would \u201cnever take a plea\u201d despite it being \u201csuggested to me before\u201d. McBride said he was afraid of his \u201cconscience\u201d, which he said had \u201calmost killed me in the past for things I did do, [that I] shouldn\u2019t have done\u201d but the prospect of jail did not, despite acknowledging it is \u201cgoing to be bad\u201d. \u201cIt was very bad the one night I spent there \u2013 but I can\u2019t do the wrong thing just for selfish motives.\u201d McBride said the case was not about information that was \u201ctruly national security\u201d related. \u201cNone of it is about our secret mind-reading powers \u2013 it\u2019s all about what happened 10 years ago on a mountaintop in Afghanistan \u2026 it\u2019s not national security, it\u2019s just nationally embarrassing.\u201d The case was adjourned until 27 June for a further mention."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
