The mayor of London appealed to so many Londoners, including a substantial proportion of Labour voters, because he let no chance go by over the last four years to defy the Tory leader. Johnson has quite often been Cameron's loudest critic, and Livingstone usually found himself overshadowed as an opponent of the government; so, for much of the time, did Ed Miliband. So the recent slump in Cameron's popularity did not drag Johnson down too. The mayor had demonstrated over and over again that he would defend London, rather than act as a meek and mild apologist for Cameron and George Osborne. There is a kind of bone-headed Tory backbencher who supposes Johnson achieved this by preaching true Tory values. It is certainly true that the mayor called for tax cuts, defended bankers and attacked the European Union, at times when the Cameroons would have considered it imprudent to do so. But Labour voters did not support Johnson in such numbers because he championed bankers. What they and many other Londoners liked was his outspokenness. It helped, of course, that Johnson believed what he was saying: he cannot see a tax without wanting to cut it, and vast wealth, as enjoyed by some bankers, has never struck him as an injustice that cries out for remedial action. But what people really appreciated was his candour. He sounded more honest than most politicians do. The unpopularity of some of the causes he espoused helped to make him sound more principled and gave him \"authenticity\". Not that Johnson ever courted unpopularity. No one plays more brilliantly to the gallery than he does, and one of the ways he does so is by picking, in the manner of an eclectic newspaper editor, a wide variety of issues, which will appeal to a wide range of people. When the mayor warned against \"any kind of Kosovo-style social cleansing of London\" through cuts in housing benefit, he could have been mistaken for a leftie. Tone is vital here. Johnson is a Merry England Conservative: his whole demeanour indicates that he wants people to enjoy themselves. He understands things and transacts business very quickly, but many a discussion with him is prolonged while he considers the jokes to which the subject lends itself. Johnson's attacks on Cameron have been ferocious, but they have never been vitriolic. Unlike Livingstone, who pursues feuds with bitter and implacable persistence, Johnson cannot bear to be disliked, and is always anxious to mend fences. When he sees Cameron or Osborne declaring the need to do something very serious, Johnson cannot resist seeing the absurd aspect of this. But the mayor proved during his first four years in office that he, too, is in his way a serious character, rather than a clown, and that he wants to achieve serious things. His method of doing this is to employ serious people, of whom during his first mayoral term Sir Simon Milton was the outstanding example, and encourage them to be as ambitious for London as possible. This approach might even mean that in about 15 years' time, our capital city has a decent airport built somewhere in the Thames Estuary. There is naturally a great deal of speculation about whether Johnson might one day replace Cameron as prime minister. I am in no doubt that he would regard getting the top job not just as the fulfilment of a long-held ambition but as a fitting recognition of his talents. But it is important not to get carried away. Cameron may have had an unhappy month or two, but he is a quick-witted and tenacious leader likely under pressure to develop his own version of authenticity. There is no vacancy at Number 10, and by the time there is, it is more than possible that the Tories will have discovered a woman educated at a northern comprehensive school who can fill it.
