I was kind of nervous about it. When I went to the open day everyone was a bit shy so it might be hard to make new friends. I only know one other person going to my new school, but I hope it will be OK. My new school is much bigger than my old school. It's weird because there are so many classrooms. The uniform is brown. I'm used to wearing a uniform. I wouldn't know what to wear in the morning if I didn't have one. My favourite lesson at my old school was literacy. We did work on grammar and punctuation and we corrected unpunctuated paragraphs. We wrote stories too. Sometimes we were given a theme and had to continue it. But I get lots more ideas at home so I try to write them down. I enjoy making up stories.I have a good imagination. Me and my friend made up a whole imaginary world. It's hard starting stories off, but I know what's going to be in the middle so I just keep going. I'm quite good at grammar, but sometimes I forget it when I am writing, but I can always go back and check. I think that I would definitely like to be a writer one day. I would like to write children's novels. I like reading a lot, too. I like adventure books and autobiographies. My favourite book is Chinese Cinderella. It's really sad. Before literacy, my favourite subject was art. I've still got loads of drawing books. My favourite things to draw are people and animals. They're quite hard to draw, but the animals are cartoon animals, so that makes it a bit easier. I'm looking forward to learning cooking. I can't cook at all. I want to learn Spanish. It sounds cool. And my uncle's fiancee is Spanish, so it would be good to be speak it. I'm looking forward to English literature too. I haven't had any homework this summer because of changing schools, which has been quite good. But - it sounds strange - some of the essays people have to do at secondary school just sound like really good fun. \u00b7 Sasha Khan is a pupil at Beal high school, Redbridge"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
