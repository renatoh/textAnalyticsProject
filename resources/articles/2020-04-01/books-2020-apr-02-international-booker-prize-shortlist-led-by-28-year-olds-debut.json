Rijneveld, a rising star in Dutch literature, is 28 \u2013 slightly older than British author Daisy Johnson was when she was shortlisted for the Booker prize in 2018, age 27. The author, who identifies as male and uses the pronouns they/them, was shortlisted after a six-hour virtual judging meeting for the \u00a350,000 prize, which is shared equally between writer and translator, for The Discomfort of Evening, translated by Michele Hutchison. The novel, tells of a girl whose brother dies in a skating accident and draws from Rijneveld\u2019s own experiences: when they were three, their 12-year-old brother was knocked over and killed by a bus. \u201cRijneveld\u2019s language renders the world anew, revealing the shocks and violence of early youth through the prism of a Dutch dairy farm. The strangeness of a child looking at the strangeness of the world,\u201d said judges of the work. The Discomfort of Evening is one of six novels in the running for the International Booker, each of which, said chair of judges Ted Hodgkinson, \u201crestlessly reinvents received narratives, from foundational myths to family folklore, plunging us into discomfiting and elating encounters with selves in a state of transition\u201d. Exploring trauma, loss and illness and translated from five languages \u2013 Spanish, German, Dutch, Farsi and Japanese \u2013 the shortlist, said Hodgkinson, \u201ctranscends this unprecedented moment, immersing us in expansively imagined lives that hold enduring fascination\u201d. Shokoofeh Azar\u2019s The Enlightenment of the Greengage Tree, translated by a writer who is remaining anonymous for security reasons, is narrated by the ghost of a 13-year-old girl fleeing her home after the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran. Daniel Kehlmann\u2019s Tyll, translated from German by Ross Benjamin, draws from medieval German folklore to tell the story of trickster Tyll Ulenspiegel. And Fernanda Melchor\u2019s Hurricane Season, translated by Sophie Hughes from Spanish, opens with the discovery of a murder victim in a Mexican village. The Adventures of China Iron, Gabriela Cabez\u00f3n C\u00e1mara\u2019s feminist retelling of Argentina\u2019s foundational gaucho epic Mart\u00edn Fierro, is translated by Iona Macintyre and Fiona Mackintosh from Spanish. And first published more than 20 years ago in 1994, Y\u014dko Ogowa\u2019s The Memory Police, translated by Stephen Snyder from Japanese, is a fable about an island where people and objects are made to disappear until the inhabitants forget they ever existed. \u201cIn these distracting and isolating times, it\u2019s difficult to see beyond the current crisis, but through these exceptional feats of translation, we encounter characters and sensibilities which have lasting resonance,\u201d said Hodgkinson, who is head of literature and spoken word at London\u2019s Southbank Centre. \u201cSome of the books on our shortlist uncannily channel the air of contagion into deft dystopias or plague-ridden historical epics, and some transport us to worlds as varied as a rural Mexican village and a Dutch dairy farm. But above all they grant us access to richly realised interior worlds, arresting enough to quieten any distraction and collapse any social distance.\u201d Hodgkinson chaired a panel of five judges who selected the shortlist from 124 submissions. The coronavirus pandemic meant their meeting had to be virtual, but Hodgkinson said he and his panel still managed to discuss the line-up for more than six hours. \u201cOf course there\u2019s no substitute for being in the same room to discuss intricate matters of translation\u2026 but in the end it didn\u2019t matter that we were as far apart as LA and Bangalore, there was enough rapport and mutual respect to traverse the distance and overcome any technical glitches,\u201d he said. Hodgkinson was joined on the panel by Lucie Campos, director of the Villa Gillet, France\u2019s centre for international writing; International Booker-winning translatorJennifer Croft; Folio-winning author Valeria Luiselli; and the Booker-shortlisted writer, poet and musician Jeet Thayil.
