Don\u2019t forget to stay with us for our live blogs of the Cricket World Cup, Women\u2019s World Cup and the French Open during the night. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow to take you through a big Sunday of sport! So long and thanks for all the fish. An upset victory from Adelaide at home will give them no end of confidence, toppling the second placed Giants by 21 points. Josh Jenkins continued his dominance in the second half, ably supported by Taylor Walker. Unbelievably it was a third draw in four games for the West Coast Fever. Netball legend Liz Ellis called for extra time during the week after a glut of draws this season and it looks like many fans will be rallying behind her after this game. Both teams squandered late chances, Kaylia Stanton throwing a baffling pass out the back of the court with 30 seconds remaining, only for the Giants to work it down to Caitlin Bassett who slotted a shot after the final whistle that was ruled no goal. Player of the match and Giants captain Kim Green was noticeably upset with the result. \u201cAt the end of the day, we didn\u2019t come here for a draw, so we\u2019re really disappointed,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to become a little bit better in those critical moments. We\u2019re not going to celebrate a draw.\u201d Cricket World Cup: Checking in on our England v Bangladesh live blog and England are doing it fairly easy so far in their innings. Bangladesh will need a big batting performance if they want to cause an upset in Cardiff today. Head on over to the blog to keep up with the latest in this match. A big second half effort from the Sea Eagles got them the two points in Townsville tonight. Two tries to nil in the second half got Manly over the line - a strong effort in attack and defence to keep the Cowboys scoreless for the half. Daly Cherry-Evans backed up from his State of Origin captaincy on Wednesday night and was very happy with his team\u2019s effort. When asked the difference to the Eagles of 2018 he was considered in his answer. \u201cI think we\u2019re making ourselves accountable to play good footy every week,\u201d he said after the game. \u201cWe\u2019re demanding consistency and while the last two weeks maybe didn\u2019t reflect that, we\u2019re working hard on it.\u201d The second half was better than the first for the Waratahs, finishing with a consolation try after the siren, but it wasn\u2019t enough to take the points and creep into second place on the Australian conference ladder. The Brumbies won\u2019t be happy with their second half defence and will need to improve heading into finals in a couple of weeks. Brumbies play maker Christian Lealiifano was happy the team wrapped up top spot with a round remaining. \u201cPleased to get the result tonight, top of the conference is really nice,\u201d he said after the match \u201cWe took our opportunities in the first half, we tried to play reasonably simple and our forward pack did their job.\u201d Cricket World Cup: An update on the injured net bowler from our man on the ground Adam Collins - he has apparently been taken to hospital as a precaution. Hopefully a quick recovery for him. Super Netball: The Giants have the half-time lead at Perth Arena, up 32-28 at half-time. The Giants have both bonus points so far, which is bad news for the Fever who need every point they can get their hands on after a poor start to the season. Also concerning for the home side are goal attack Kaylia Stanton\u2019s shooting stats - yet to score after 30 minutes. AFL: Adelaide hold a narrow lead over GWS at half-time, ahead 4.7 (31) to 3.4 (22). Josh Jenkins doing some great work for the home side so far, with six disposals and two goals to his name in the first half. Cricket World Cup: A local net bowler suffered a head injury during a training session with the Australian team at the Oval. From AAP: A local net bowler had to be stretchered from the ground after being struck in the head by a David Warner straight drive in Australia\u2019s training session at The Oval. Australia were completing preparations for Sunday\u2019s game against India when Warner drove a half-volley back towards the medium pacer. The ball struck the bowler in the head. He went to ground and required urgent medical assistance before being taken off in a medicab. The Australian team showed immediate concern for the bowler, with training stopped for more than 10 minutes. Warner was comforted by assistant coach Ricky Ponting while he checked on the man\u2019s welfare and did not immediately resume batting. Super Rugby: The Waratahs were handed a brilliant opportunity to leapfrog the Rebels into second place on the Australian conference ladder, but they\u2019re not looking like making use of it, trailing the Brumbies 28-3 at half-time. The Brumbies have shared the scoring load, while Christian Lealiifano has been spot on with the boot, nailing all four conversions. NRL: Half time in Townsville and the Cowboys lead the Sea Eagles 20-12. It\u2019s all about Jake Clifford for the North Queenslanders tonight - he has scored all three of their tries, including the clincher right on the siren. The Sea Eagles won\u2019t be happy with their finish to the half, blowing a 12-2 lead to go into the break behind. AFL: Very thought provoking discussion from ID9357571 in the comments regarding the AFL\u2019s apology to Adam Goodes this week: \u201cSo the apology from the AFL - three and half years after the collective crime committed against this generations greatest Indigenous footballer, in direct response to two documentaries outlining their complicity in his despicable and racist treatment - smacks of a brand damage limitation exercise. And embarrassingly not so subtle given the previewing of the documentaries by the AFL. Let me know your thoughts, either in the comments or on Twitter, was it a genuine apology or simply a case of damage control? French Open: We\u2019ve got live blogs galore tonight! Head on over to our French Open blog as we follow along with an exciting semi final between Novak Djokovic and Dominic Thiem. Super Netball: After the dust settled from the Diamonds selections last week, the harsh reality of taking a mid-season break in the Super Netball began to sink in. Already it has had an impact, with the NSW Swifts this week announcing that they will allow English import Natalie Haythornthwaite to rest until the World Cup, not taking the court for her Super Netball franchise until after the completion of the tournament. There are all kinds of complications that arise from this five week break in play, which Erin Delahunty broke down beautifully in her column this week. Well, things didn\u2019t get any better for the Rebels in the second half. If you can believe it, things actually got worse. Brandon Ennor and Sevu Reece each bagged a hat trick for the Crusaders and the Rebels differential has taken one hell of a hammering. A win for the Waratahs over the Brumbies tonight will see them leapfrog their southern rivals into second place on the Australian conference ladder. While they couldn\u2019t stretch the lead further with a conversion attempt after the siren, there is plenty to celebrate for the Sharks tonight. A dominant 20-point win over the Eels will do a lot for their confidence at this stage of the season and will keep them safely inside the eight. In more good news for the boys from the Shire, Wade Graham made a successful return to the field tonight, playing his first game in nine months after rupturing his ACL in last year\u2019s qualifying final. \u201cI felt good,\u201d said Graham after the game. \u201cThe lungs need a bit of work, but it was a relief to get out there. Glad it\u2019s done and now I can get into the season. It was pretty disappointing we let those tries in late, but we got the win and that\u2019s what matters.\u201d Hopefully the team will shout him a soft serve at Engadine Maccas tonight to celebrate. It wasn\u2019t the second half the Kangaroos would have wanted, but they will be pleased to take the four points out of this one. The Suns will take heart from a stronger second half but will rue the fact that it was too little, too late. Kangaroos forward Mason Wood was pleased with his form in the game, but was quick to credit his team for his good work. \u201cI\u2019m a product of how the team\u2019s going - three wins from the last three games has been great,\u201d he said after the game. Cricket World Cup: The England v Bangladesh match is about to get underway in Cardiff. Join Rob Smyth and Adam Collins for over-by-over updates and see if Bangladesh can sneak in a win against the hosts. NBA: Interesting talking point out of the US this week with news that the NBA wants to increase female coaches and referees with the aim to hit 50%. Though I find the line \u201cI\u2019m not sure how it was so male-dominated for so long\u201d from NBA commissioner Adam Silver quite staggering. I have a few ideas, starting with wilful exclusion, that I could share with him if he\u2019s open to it. Cricket World Cup: Have you listened to The Guardian\u2019s new cricket podcast The Spin yet? It\u2019s a cracker of an episode this week as Emma John is joined by Rob Eastaway and Jon Harvey to discuss why cricket was better in the 90s. It\u2019s only 39 minutes long, so plenty of time to listen before England v Bangladesh starts. Super Rugby: Things aren\u2019t looking quite so happy for the Melbourne Rebels, trailing 26-0 to the seemingly unstoppable Crusaders. It illustrates the stark difference between the Australian and New Zealand conferences, with the Crusaders first of the Kiwis and the Rebels second on the Australian ladder. NRL: Half time at Shark Park and the home side are looking happy with a 14-point lead over Parramatta. A Josh Dugan try right on the hooter sets them up for a big second half and the chance to push their advantage home for a much needed boost to their points differential. French Open: If you\u2019re planning to be up late watching Ash Barty play in the French Open final, make sure you check out our Guardian live blog for the best insights live from Roland-Garros. To get you ready for the #BartyParty, have a read of Simon Cambers\u2019 great analysis of the rise of this young star. State of Origin: The NSW team for the women\u2019s State of Origin was named today, with Kezie Apps to lead the team for the first time. 2018 captain Maddie Studdon retains her spot but has been asked to concentrate on her half back duties. I think my favourite story of the team is 43-year-old Kylie Hilder who comes back into the side at hooker after a decade. If that\u2019s not a comeback, I don\u2019t know what is. Women\u2019s World Cup: What a week of build up it\u2019s been - we\u2019re all just itching for the Matildas to get underway against Italy tomorrow night. During the week, our sensational football reporter Richard Parkin caught up with Matildas veteran Lisa de Vanna to get her thoughts on the team\u2019s preparation. It\u2019s refreshing to hear how frank and honest she is - so unusual in modern sport. I think netball fans will see some similarities between de Vanna and Collingwood\u2019s Nat Medhurst - from the 1984 birthdate to the willingness to speak her mind to the refusal to accept less than perfection from herself and those around her. A fascinating read. AFL: Half-time on the Gold Coast sees the Kangaroos with a solid early lead over the Suns 9.5 (59) to 4.3 (27). A big win tonight could put North Melbourne in touch with the top eight, so they will be looking to build in the second half and get a big percentage booster out of this one. NRL: Across the ditch the Storm were too strong for the Warriors, running out 22-point winners over the New Zealanders. From AAP: Hughes stars in Storm win over Warriors A breakout performance from Melbourne fullback Jahrome Hughes has helped orchestrate a 32-10 win over the Warriors that ensures the Storm top the standings at the midway point of the NRL season. Not at their best until the second half, Melbourne were irrepressible in fighting back from 10-2 down late in the first half in Auckland on Saturday to register a fourth straight win. It was their eighth successive defeat of the Warriors, who slump to a 4-8 record and are gazing at a sizeable task to play finals football. Kiwi-born Hughes was the chief executioner, bagging the first double of his NRL career with crucial tries either side of halftime. The 24-year-old did so after switching to halfback, where he played the last 50 minutes after Brodie Croft was forced off with a head knock. His energy, the craft of Cameron Smith and the toil of a pack led by Dale Finucane allowed Melbourne to take control of a match dogged by blustery winds and a high penalty count. Despite fielding Josh Addo-Carr, Will Chambers, Cameron Munster and Felise Kaufusi three days after their State of Origin duty, they owned the second half, scoring 24 unanswered points. Kodi Nikorima was a central figure in all three first-half tries as the Warriors ground out a 10-8 lead. Nikorima\u2019s speed created space for impressive left winger Ken Maumalo to bag his ninth try of the term. The diminutive five-eighth then crossed courtesy of a Blake Green grubber. However, Nikorima was the villain when Hughes stepped inside him after a neat Smith blindside switch. Hughes strolled over for his second in contentious fashion, with the Bunker ignoring Warriors claims of obstruction from Finucane on Issac Luke. Melbourne\u2019s late dominance resulted in tries to Suliasi Vunivalu, Jesse Bromwich and Marion Seve. The Bromwich try was meritorious given Melbourne had been reduced to 12 players following the sin-binning of Christian Welsh for persistent team offending. Super Netball: The Adelaide Thunderbirds nearly caused an almighty upset this afternoon in Darwin, up by one goal going into the final quarter against defending premiers Sunshine Coast Lightning. The late injection of Ugandan star Peace Proscovia sealed the deal for the Queenslanders, but there were promising signs from persistent cellar dwellers the Thunderbirds during the game. Talking to new Super Netball Commission Chair Marina Go during the week, she emphasised that the league is only as strong as its weakest team and the rise of the Thunderbirds will be heartening for competition organisers to see. AFL: Big news for Carlton this afternoon, coming from behind to beat Brisbane in David Teague\u2019s first game as head coach. From AAP: Carlton have climbed off the canvas in David Teague\u2019s first AFL game in charge, coming from behind to defeat Brisbane by 15 points at Marvel Stadium. The Blues conceded the first six goals of Saturday\u2019s game before mounting a Patrick Cripps-inspired comeback to prevail 11.12 (78) to 9.9 (63), less than a week after sacking fourth-year coach Brendon Bolton. Cripps was sublime for Carlton in just their second win for the season, gathering 38 disposals and booting four goals in another performance certain to net him three Brownlow Medal votes. The brilliant skipper put the result beyond doubt in the dying minutes when he soared out of a pack and kicked truly for his fourth major. Ed Curnow (30 disposals, eight clearances) was also influential in the midfield and helped to quell the influence of Brisbane ball magnet Lachie Neale, while younger brother Charlie booted three goals in his best game of the season. Neale racked up 24 disposals to halftime but managed just seven after Curnow went to him in the second half. After witnessing North Melbourne upset Richmond in Rhyce Shaw\u2019s first game in charge, Carlton fans were hoping their own caretaker coach would conjure something similar. But six minutes into the second quarter, Brisbane held a six-goal lead and the Blues were yet to kick a major. The Blues had 10 of the first 11 inside-50s but continued to waste their opportunities, allowing Brisbane to seize the momentum. Quick goals to Charlie Cameron, Neale and Hugh McCluggage extended the Lions\u2019 lead to six goals before Michael Gibbons finally put the Blues on the board at the 12-minute mark of the second term. Having reduced the margin to three goals at halftime, the Blues came out firing in the third quarter as Cripps booted two goals in quick succession. Mitch McGovern then took a strong contested mark and kicked truly to put Carlton ahead and pave the way for a much-needed victory. Key defender Harris Andrews held Harry McKay goalless and was among Brisbane\u2019s best but the Lions were well-beaten in the midfield. The Blues host the Western Bulldogs at Marvel Stadium next Saturday while the fifth-placed Lions head into their mid-season bye with seven wins and five losses, having blown a golden opportunity to remain in touch with the top four. Hello and welcome to a big night in sport! We\u2019ve got lots going on tonight, with NRL, AFL, Super Netball and Super Rugby on the agenda. We\u2019ll also have standalone blogs later in the night for the Cricket World Cup matches, Women\u2019s World Cup and of course the French Open.
