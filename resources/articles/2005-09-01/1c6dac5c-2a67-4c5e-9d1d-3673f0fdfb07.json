With police and the army involved in pitched battles with mobs of loyalists up to 700-strong in the east of the city and renewed rioting at several other flashpoints, men with revolvers stopped cars in north Belfast and Rathcoole. With the debris of Saturday night's \"orgy of violence\" still carpeting the streets and more cars and lorries being added to the wrecks of those burned out earlier, some areas had effectively been turned into no-go areas for security forces. Police claimed to have reopened the Albert Bridge Road, a main route into the city, early yesterday after a night of rioting on Saturday. But by 5pm hundreds of rioters had taken control of the streets again, and were pummelling convoys of police armoured cars with bricks, metal bars and scaffolding poles. Others rained missiles over the peace wall on to homes in the Catholic enclave of Short Strand. Officers played a deadly game of dare with the rioters, charging convoys of up to 10 armoured vehicles into rioters to make \"snatch\" arrests. Meanwhile, in the barricaded backstreets, others brought up fresh improvised weaponry and blast, pipe and petrol bombs. In the alleys the wounded were treated with bags of frozen peas and swigs of morale-boosting lager. Trouble also broke out at Ardoyne Road, Tiger's Bay, Tates Avenue and Donegall Pass and Bangor, north Down, just as mayhem had reigned across loyalist areas of Belfast and Antrim for 12 hours on Saturday night. Police yesterday displayed their armoured Land Rovers, which had been peppered with automatic fire. More than 2,000 police and soldiers had to be brought in to quell what one officer called \"mob rule\". One man was critically injured after being caught in an explosion, another was shot in the stomach by a loyalist sniper. Police later found seven guns and what they termed a \"bomb factory\". The initial Saturday disturbances followed the re-routing of a relatively small Orange march at Whiterock in north Belfast. The march had been delayed by three months because of the strength of feeling and last week loyalists had set up ad hoc road blocks at rush-hour in protest. Tensions were already high in the area following police raids aimed at curbing the bloody feud raging between the rival loyalist paramilitary groups, the UVF and LVF, that has claimed four lives this summer. That turf war escalated further on Friday when two men were shot in separate gun attacks in Portadown. Then tension hit a higher notch when Ian Paisley, the now undisputed leader of unionism, warned that the Whiterock parade could prove \"the spark which kindles a fire there could be no putting out\". The first hint of the havoc ahead came when a 29-year-old Catholic man was savagely beaten by 10 men early on Saturday morning on the Albert Bridge Road near the Short Strand. After snipers fired at least 50 shots at his officers following the parade, the chief constable, Sir Hugh Orde, accused the Orange Order of stoking the violence. He said: \"I have seen members of the Orange Order in their sashes attacking my officers. I have seen them standing next to masked men. That is simply not good enough ... The Orange Order must bear substantial responsibility for this. \"They publicly called people on to the street. If you do that, you cannot abdicate responsibility.\" Yesterday the Orange Order condemned Sir Hugh's remarks as \"inaccurate and inflammatory\", but the chief constable later released footage showing Orangemen attacking police lines. In a lull in the rioting yesterday morning, young loyalists on the Albert Bridge road spoke of their frustration with the peace process. \"This is not a peace process, this is a republican process,\" one of them told the Guardian. \"We have got the guns out now and we are not putting them away,\" another added. \"They have got rid of everything Protestants hold dear, the UDR and the Royal Irish Regiment. The police is now filled with Taigs [Catholics] and they treat us young Protestants as scum.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
