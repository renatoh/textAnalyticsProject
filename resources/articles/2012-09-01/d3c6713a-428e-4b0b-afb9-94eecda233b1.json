Morrisons and quiches? This could all end in tears", "bodyText": "Glencore boss Ivan Glasenberg is supposedly one of the world's shrewdest traders, so he'll be acutely aware of the choice facing him this week: either he performs a humiliating volte-face by increasing his bid for the mining group Xstrata, or he must risk never having complete control of an asset so coveted that he was prepared to put his notoriously secretive company through the irritation of a public listing to get it. We will know which trade-off he's plumped for by Friday, when Xstrata shareholders are due to vote on Glencore's plan to combine the pair into a \u00a353bn natural resources giant \u2013 although the latest opinion polls suggest the scheme is set for a comprehensive defeat. Still, there remains a chance that Glasenberg will sacrifice his reputation to land the prize (and save Xstrata's obedient board from the vengeance of their own shareholders). But should Glasenberg be considering a late increase to his bid, then he needs to be reminded of the perils of dawdling. As a young man, the commodity trader almost competed as a speed-walker in the 1984 Olympics. Apartheid meant that his native South Africa was barred from the games but, with his Jewish ancestry, he sought to go as an Israeli. Sadly, Glasenberg failed to complete his paperwork in time. Rising quiche but falling sales at Morrisons In one of his adverts for the supermarket chain Morrisons, England cricket hero Andrew \"Freddie\" Flintoff takes a bunch of young children on a shopping trip for a party. As they fill up the trolley with hearty favourites such as joints of British beef, hot cross buns and cupcakes, Freddie suddenly stops his group on the way to the checkout and asks: \"Did you get the quiche?\" It is hardly the worst gag you'll be subjected to in a supermarket commercial (that remains the most fiercely competitive field in the industry) but the supposed joke of a lad from Preston fancying such fare now seems to be on the retailer. The company unveils its interim results this week with City analysts expecting dire numbers, including falling like-for-like sales. Among the criticisms are the usual concerns about the chain's lack of online shopping and convenience stores, as well as the Bradford-based grocer suddenly appearing to have abandoned its core customer by trying to become too posh. Veg counters spewing out dry ice seem the most obvious irritant \u2013 meaning (to butcher another of the group's old ads) there are fewer reasons to shop at Morrisons. How long have we got to save the euro now? In January 2011, Hungary's prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n reckoned there was six months to \"save the euro\". By June, the schedule still held, as a meeting between Germany's chancellor Angela Merkel and France's then president, Nicolas Sarkozy, prompted headlines hinting there was just \"45 minutes\" to do the same. So we should perhaps be mildly sceptical in 2012 about suggestions that European Central Bank president Mario Draghi now has two weeks to try again. Still, having promised to do \"whatever it takes\" to save the currency in July, Draghi now faces an important fortnight in which he needs to justify bondholders' recent optimism that he's managed to unearth a plausible euro solution while on his summer holidays. The next two weeks potentially will see fresh ECB bond-buying measures, a Spanish plea for aid, plus clues about whether the market will raise its boot from Greece's throat and ease the terms of its bailout. Meanwhile, German judges and Dutch voters will also get a say on the currency's future (or otherwise). Amid all that, Draghi convenes the ECB's governing council on Thursday, with analysts daring to dream he'll utter the magic word \"unlimited\". That's as in ECB intervention, not supposed deadlines. Making a marque They used to say that Range Rovers had heated rear windscreens to keep their owners' hands warm as they pushed them home, but the marque's reputation has been transformed since then. Nowadays Jaguar Land Rover, which makes the beasts, is lauded as that highly unusual case of a British manufacturing success story (albeit one that, rather less unusually, is foreign owned). The company has recently hired an extra 1,000 workers at its Halewood plant in Merseyside to launch a three-shift, 24-hour operation - as the carmaker attempts to satisfy demand for its new Range Rover Evoque, which is very popular despite a tie-up with Victoria Beckham. This week will also see the manufacturer unveil its latest line, \"the all new Range Rover\", a model made in Solihull and which the company boasts \"has delivered significant enhancements in performance and agility\". That's more than can be said for British manufacturing, as yet another depressing purchasing managers' index is expected to show tomorrow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
