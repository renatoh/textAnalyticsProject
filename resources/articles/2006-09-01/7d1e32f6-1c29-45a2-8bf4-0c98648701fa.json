Our children don't like that kind of 'over-priced, low-fat rubbish', say the women, who are, instead, delivering around 50 or 60 more appreciated hamburger and fizzy drink meals a day through the school fence. Marvellous. A blow for freedom and one in the eye for a nanny state apparently determined to deprive children of some of the simple pleasures of their young lives. Children should not be expected to follow every politically correct stricture of the self-appointed health police. And while you're out there, Mum, what about the fags and alcopops?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
