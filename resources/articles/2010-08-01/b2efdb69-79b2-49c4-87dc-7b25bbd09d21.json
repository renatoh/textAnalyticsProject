The announcement came amid growing criticism of Zardari for going ahead with the trip rather than staying at home to manage the disaster, which is thought to have claimed 1,600 lives and affected four million people. It had previously been reported that Zardari would join his son, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, in Birmingham at a rally where the 21-year-old would launch his political career to follow in the footsteps of his late mother, Benazir Bhutto. \"I will not even be attending the [Birmingham] event and instead I will be opening a donation point at the Pakistani high commission in London for victims of the terrible floods which have ravaged northern Pakistan,\" Bhutto Zardari said in a statement last night. The Oxford graduate also played down speculation over his political future, adding that he intended to further his academic and political knowledge and was considering studying law. Bhutto Zardari's announcement will further complicate what was already a fraught diplomatic trip following David Cameron's remarks in India last week about Pakistan \"looking both ways\" when it came to terrorism. In keeping with both sides' determination to restore their battered relations and to calm nerves, Zardari's London visit to meet ministers and MPs yesterday was a low-key affair. The official word from the Home Office was that the meeting there had been private: times would not be confirmed, nor would details of what was discussed. The president later met four parliamentarians for lunch at the Pakistani high commission, including the Conservative MPs Rehman Chishti and Sajid Javid and the former Labour MPs Shahid Malik and Mohammad Sarwar. Other Labour MPs did not attend the meeting, including Sarwar's son Anas who now has his father's Glasgow Central seat. Another, Khalid Mahmood, said he had boycotted the meeting. \"I am disgusted with him being here,\" said Mahmood. \"He should be looking after his own people. His visit shows his indifference to his own people.\" Pakistani officials have reassured journalists that the president was staying \"in the cheapest five-star hotel in central London \u2026 not in a royal suite, but in a relatively cheaper suite\". The Churchill Hotel in Portman Square might be somewhat miffed: it boasts five-star luxury at prices upward of \u00a3300 a night. Even more ordinary rooms for the entourage run to \u00a3250. The president was tonight meeting Cameron at Chequers for an informal dinner, to be followed by more formal talks and more emollient statements tomorrow. A Downing Street spokesman said: \"The prime minister is looking forward to welcoming President Zardari to Chequers. It is an important opportunity to reinforce the strong links between the UK and Pakistan and continue to support stability, security, democracy and prosperity [there].\" On the agenda will be the international response to the floods, co-operation in fighting terrorism, Pakistan's economy, strengthening educational ties and the situation in Afghanistan, following the president's remarks to a French newspaper earlier in the week that the allies are losing the war there."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
