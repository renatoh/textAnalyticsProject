M&amp;S shocked the City on Monday when it announced a boardroom shake-up which will see the departure of chairman Lord Burns and Rose installed in a position of power at the top of the company which contravenes boardroom best practice guidelines. Only a handful of major companies, including ITV and Cable &amp; Wireless, have executive chairmen and they were accepted by shareholders because the companies were in dire straits. Rose and outgoing chairman Burns said the M&amp;S boss was stepping up in order to better plan his eventual succession. Rose is handing over some of his day-to-day responsibilities to his lieutenants and intends to see which of a field of seven or eight senior executives rises best to the challenge over the next three years, when Rose intends to retire. Legal &amp; General, M&amp;S's second biggest shareholder, has already reacted angrily to the boardroom changes. In a statement the investor - which is not normally outspoken on corporate governance issues - called Rose's promotion a \"potentially damaging concentration of power\" and an \"unwelcome\" move. The Association of British Insurers also weighed in, saying Rose's new role raised \"pretty fundamental concerns\". Details of the M&amp;S boss's new pay deal in the new role have not yet been released. A spokesman for the Pensions and Investment Research Consultants advisory group said: \"The combination of chairman and chief executive is a clear breach of well established and widely accepted best practice principles. We will not support it.\" The group is publishing a newsletter tomorrow which will outline its objections to the M&amp;S move. The spokesman added: \"We will need some serious convincing that this is a good idea, especially since it is going to go on until 2011. \"Other companies manage to do their succession planning without combining the roles of chairman and chief executive. This is about concentration of power. We are certainly not in favour and don't think our clients will be either.\" Other investors have also made it clear they are considering their response to the Rose promotion. The M&amp;S boss is not up for re-election at this year's AGM so shareholders cannot protest by voting against the move. They are also unlikely to force the company to back-pedal as they believe Rose is likely to quit rather than back down.
