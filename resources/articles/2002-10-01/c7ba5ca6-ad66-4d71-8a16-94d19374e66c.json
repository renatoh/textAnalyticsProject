OK, where were you? Fainting is common in hot, stuffy conditions. Not on the Tube were you? No, I was at home. I got up from the chair and poof, everything went swirly. That's not so much of a concern - fainting after getting up suddenly is a natural reaction caused by the sudden drop in blood pressure. It's for the same reason that a shock can bring on fainting; your blood pressure hits your boots and you hit the floor. Did you notice any other symptoms? Like what? Speeding or sudden slowing of your heartbeat - they can signify a heart disorder. Confusion, difficulty moving your arms? Hold on. Now you mention it, my arm did feel funny. Funny how? Well, a bit numb and tingly. I thought I'd just landed on it when I fell, hit my funny bone or something, it went after an hour. OK, numb, tingly and fainting may not mean anything but they are also common symptoms of something called a transient ischaemic attack, which occurs when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted. It can be a one-off, but it can also be a warning sign that you may be at risk of a stroke. A what? I thought you were just going to tell me to eat more chocolate to keep my blood sugar up... Quite possibly the opposite, actually: high cholesterol is one of the things linked to a TIA, and if you have had one, the doctors will want you to do everything you can to keep your circulation healthy in order to ward off any further problems. Still, we don't know anything for certain yet, so please go and see your GP now."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
