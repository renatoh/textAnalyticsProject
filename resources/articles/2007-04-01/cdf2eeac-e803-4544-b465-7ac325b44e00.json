As a minister was heckled over pay at a union conference in Brighton, doctors' pressure group Remedy UK held a rally in Westminster to back up an opposition debate on a new computerised recruitment system for specialist training. Labour MP Ian Gibson joined the shadow health secretary, Andrew Lansley, and the Liberal Democrat health spokesman, Norman Lamb, in addressing the protest amid warnings from the British Medical Association that thousands of doctors could be forced to leave the UK unless the government fixes the Medical Training Application Service. Patricia Hewitt, the health secretary, has already apologised for the \"terrible anxiety\" it has caused and promised a review. \"The boldest thing to do in this situation is to scrap what happens and start again,\" Dr Gibson said. Andy Burnham, the health minister, endured half an hour of jeers and heckling at the annual conference of Unison, the public service union, as delegates protested at the government's decision to withhold part of this year's pay increase until November. Nurses, paramedics and healthcare auxiliaries, who are preparing to ballot for a strike, waved handwritten posters telling him: \"Low pay. No way. NHS here to stay.\" But after a plea for restraint from the conference chairman they allowed the minister to finish his speech. Mr Burnham gave no ground on pay, but promised to abandon plans to privatise the Prescription Pricing Department, an NHS agency that administers the dispensing of medicines in England. The Department of Health had been working on a scheme to cut costs by sending the work offshore, but Mr Burnham said: \"While we have further work to get better value for money, there will not be any outsourcing or offshoring.\" The minister tried to win over delegates by promising to reduce the flow of centrally-set targets. He said there would be no more boundary reorganisations or upheavals in the short to medium term. But delegates shouted in dissent when Mr Burnham said he was \"defending to the hilt the fundamental principles of the NHS\". When he appealed to staff to avoid playing into the hands of critics of the health service, they yelled back: \"We are your critics.\" When he asked for a constructive dialogue with the unions, they laughed derisively. The health unions were protesting about a decision by Gordon Brown to withhold part of a 2.5% increase recommended by an independent pay review body, which was due from April 1. Staff got 1.5% this month and must wait until November for a further 1%. Karen Jennings, Unison's head of health, said: \"The conference conducted itself well, given the strength of feeling.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
