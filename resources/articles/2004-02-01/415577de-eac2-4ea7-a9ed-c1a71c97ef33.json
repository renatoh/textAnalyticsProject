The club's biggest creditors, including the Prudential owner M&amp;G, MetLife and Teachers, have so far agreed to the Leeds chief executive Trevor Birch's pleas for more time to come up with a solution to their huge debt. It would only take one of the three to get cold feet over the agreement, in which they are waiving repayments on a \u00a360m bond, to push the club into administration. Leeds are believed to owe more than \u00a3102m, with other creditors including the insurance group Gerling and the Inland Revenue. If Leeds stay up this season the creditors believe that they will get more for the club as a going concern, but if relegation becomes a certainty then administration is more likely. Newcastle United were last night cautiously optimistic that the scan on Craig Bellamy's injured knee would reveal no long-term damage. Bellamy was the subject of a crunching tackle by Blackburn's Lucas Neill during Wednesday night's 1-1 draw at Ewood Park. Given Bellamy's recent injury problems - this was his first start for four months - there were fears at St James' Park that the challenge might have aggravated a previous complaint. The initial diagnosis, however, suggested that the Welshman has limited ligament stress and may be available for Newcastle's next Premiership fixture, at home to Middlesbrough on February 21. \"It held up well,\" said Bellamy. \"I have strained the medial [ligament] but it is fine, to be honest, because it gave the knee a test. I am happy I stayed on; I felt sharp and played 90 minutes, which pleased me. \" The Port Vale manager Brian Horton has parted company with the club by mutual consent after five years in charge at Vale Park."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
