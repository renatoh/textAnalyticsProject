I have learned the sad story of Tijuana, a town that became a city for all the wrong reasons. I have learned that royal decree trumps the presence of a cathedral. I have learned who John Renbourn is and of his finger-picking skills. I suppose I've also learned that I might need to be more specific in my instructions \u2013 the ghost of the mighty Lynskey lingers over these pages still, and his attention to detail does, I'm afraid, not come naturally to me. I will, however, try my damnedest to sharpen up from this week's topic onwards; but first, the B-list. Vampire Weekend \u2013 Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa Cape Cod isn't a town, it's a Cape. But it's not that big, and in this song at least, it's a homogenous whole \u2013 marked out by beaches and Benetton. Goodbye Toulouse \u2013 The Stranglers A city, not a town, and a real, big one at that, but I liked the way Hugh Cornwell rails at it as if at a lover. And, yes, worra bassline. Statesboro Blues \u2013 Blind Willie McTell He lost out in the blues-off against John Lee Hooker, but only marginally. Hooker won for his arpeggios and for singing a song about the town it was named after. The Proclaimers \u2013 Sunshine On Leith Much more maudlin than I remembered. In fact, too bloody maudlin by half for my tastes, but then the Proclaimers helped contribute to one of the dark moments of my adolescence. Which may have something to do with it. The Go Betweens \u2013 Darlinghurst Nights Oh, what an atmosphere. A evocative reflection on younger days that's both misty-eyed and unsettling. Which kind of covers over the fact that Darlinghurst isn't a town, it's a suburb. The Delgados \u2013 Blackpool Very 1990s, this. Swelling, bordering on the anthemic, and with a trip-hop breakout, I couldn't listen without the image of Chris Evans popping into my head. Oddly, I liked it. The Style Council \u2013 Come to Milton Keynes This is the sort of sarky, withering disdain I was expecting when I suggested the topic of towns. That this song is total bilge stands as tribute to my misplaced assumptions. Joy Denalane \u2013 Soweto 76 \u2013 06 As it covers the same ground as Miriam Makeba, though in more detail, this could only make the B-list. But while Makeba's song holds great emotional power, Denalane has the funk! The breakdown, in particular, is impossibly funky. Stray Cats \u2013 Rumble In Brighton Mumbled vocals, furious rockabilly, what better way to conjure up those bank holiday rucks of yore! There's a \"rumble on the beach tonight\", all right. Randy Newman \u2013 Birmingham Another city, unfortunately, though Newman does refer to \"downtown\" Birmingham, which does at least have the keyword in it. A lovely, if perhaps ironic, ode to the centre of the civil rights movement. So, on to this week's topic. I'm not sure why French came into my head, perhaps it was because of Goodbye Toulouse, perhaps it was the thought of getting Je Ne Sais Pas Pourquoi on an A-list. Either way, I decided it would be a good idea. Obviously, two years ago, Dorian did multilingual songs but a) it was two years ago, give a guy a break and b) re-reading his column, it seemed the man himself felt there was more material to be mined. And so we will. The songs you recommend (and I liked the clarification on last week's blog \u2013 yes, the first prerequisite should be that you like the song you nominate) must contain no less than a phrase of French, but need not be entirely in the language. As last week, I will consider each song on their merits and if anyone wants to make a case for an instrumental track I will be happy to hear it.
