There were 50 new confirmed or probable cases of Covid-19 in New Zealand on Wednesday, with 4,098 tests for the virus processed on Tuesday. The number of new cases dropped from 54 on Tuesday and 67 on Monday. New Zealand\u2019s government announced a strict national lockdown a fortnight ago that requires everyone except essential workers to stay home at all times, unless they are accessing vital services or walking for exercise. Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister, said while the country \u201cmight see bumps along the way,\u201d she was encouraged that the country might be \u201cturning a corner\u201d in quashing the spread of the virus. \u201cI have cautious optimism, but now is the time to stay the course,\u201d she told reporters at parliament in Wellington on Wednesday. In total, 1,210 total cases have been reported in New Zealand with 282 of those people now recovered from the virus. One person has died of the coronavirus since the pandemic began. There are 12 people in hospital, four of them in intensive care and two of those in a critical condition. New Zealand\u2019s approach in invoking early, restrictive shutdown measures has been widely praised. But two weeks into a lockdown of at least four weeks, officials warned against complacency as arrests rose over breaches of the rules. A total 76 people were caught by officers violating the stay-at-home restrictions in the previous 24 hours alone, said police commissioner Andrew Coster on Wednesday, adding that a total of 367 breaches had been recorded by the police so far. Eight officers had been forced into self-isolation after people claiming to have Covid-19 had spat on them in \u201cincredibly distressing\u201d incidents, Coster said. \u201cYou end up with people who don\u2019t know whether they\u2019re at risk,\u201d he added. While the restrictive measures have been widely supported in New Zealand, heads of industry urged MPs on Wednesday for more clarity on a roadmap for how businesses would exit the lockdown. Phil O\u2019Reilly, the former chief executive of Business New Zealand, told meeting of the parliamentary committee scrutinising the government\u2019s actions on Covid-19 that firms understood officials could not yet say when the most restrictive shutdown measures would end. But lifting them without warning would cause \u201call sorts of confusion\u201d, he said. \u201cBusiness is not saying tell us a date,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re saying tell us a pathway.\u201d Chris Roberts, representing the tourism sector, New Zealand\u2019s biggest export earner, said he expected an NZ$12bn drop in tourist spending over the next six months. Most companies had \u201czero\u201d income and would need government support beyond its wage subsidy scheme, he added. But halfway through the country\u2019s month-long lockdown, attention was mostly fixed on surviving the next two weeks. Ardern, speaking at her daily news conference, was asked how her life had changed during the shutdown. \u201cI miss people,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is nothing against any of the fine people in this room,\u201d she added, referring to the reporters she briefs daily. \u201cBut I am used to having a lot of contact with the public.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
