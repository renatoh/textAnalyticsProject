Since 2015, funds for pupils with SEN have fallen by 17%, while those with less complex needs have been particularly affected. We\u2019d like to speak to parents and guardians who have taken their local authority to a SEND tribunal to challenge a decision over a child\u2019s Education Health and Care (EHC) plan or needs assessment. How to contribute We want to hear from people who have been part of a legal battle over SEND funding about the impact it\u2019s had on their lives. Did you get the outcome you\u2019d hoped for? Did you have to take time off work to try and secure extra support for your child? How has your child\u2019s education and health been affected?
