If Valentine's Day means a battle with the chocolates rather than a chance for romance, Stobo offers treatments and activities designed to help you stay healthy and in love. Stobo is an early 19th century castle set within beautiful grounds - ideal for a romantic break. It was opened as a spa in 1978, and now offers 70 different facial and body treatments. There are guided walks through the grounds every day, or alternatively take one of the mountain bikes provided and explore further afield. For the Guardian Unlimited Travel prize winner, Stobo Castle is offering a prize of a two-night stay for two people. Both guests will be entitled to unlimited use of the facilities, all meals and two back massages.
