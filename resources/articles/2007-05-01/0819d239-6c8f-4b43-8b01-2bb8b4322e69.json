Loeb was four kilometres into the gravel stage in Sardinia when he approached a crest too fast. When his Citro\u00ebn landed, the front-left wheel hit loose gravel by the side of the road and the car slid into a ditch. The impact damaged the car's front suspension, forcing the Frenchman into retirement. His previous rally-ending accident was on the 2005 Rally Australia when he was also leading by a considerable margin. \"Some people have said that I make winning look easy sometimes; now everyone can see that this is never the case,\" said the triple world champion. \"When you have a big lead it's always difficult to judge the correct pace to be driving at. In this case, I think my pace notes were optimistic; I was going too fast.\" His retirement meant that Gronholm won the rally and also moved into a seven-point championship lead. The Finn's Ford team also reinforced its advantage to 21 points in the manufacturers' championship, thanks to second place for his team-mate Mikko Hirvonen. It was a dramatic turnaround in the fortunes of Gronholm, who despite finishing second to Loeb in the past four rallies has been unable to match him for pace. \"It's been depressing to have finished second to S\u00e9bastien so often,\" he said. \"But we've also been quite unlucky with a few things so maybe what happened in Sardinia means that S\u00e9bastien can be unlucky too.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
