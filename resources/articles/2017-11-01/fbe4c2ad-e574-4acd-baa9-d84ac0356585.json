While Donald Trump\u2019s special adviser on energy and environment, David Banks, said cutting emissions was a US priority, \u201cenergy security, economic prosperity are higher priorities\u201d, he said. \u201cThe president has a responsibility to protect jobs and industry across the country.\u201d Other attendees at the summit condemned the argument. \u201cPromoting coal at a climate summit is like promoting tobacco at a cancer summit,\u201d said Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor and a UN special envoy for cities and climate change. Benson Kibiti, from the Kenya Climate Working Group, said: \u201cMore coal will entrench poverty.\u201d When questioned, just one of the four energy executives Trump\u2019s team chose to speak at the event expressed support for his decision to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement. At the only official event put on by the US government at the two-week summit, Banks said: \u201cWithout a question, fossil fuels will continue to be used and we would argue that it is in the global interest that when it is used it is is clean and efficient as possible.\u201d \u201cThis panel is only controversial if we choose to bury our heads in the sand and ignore the realities of the global energy system,\u201d he added. The event was interrupted when about three-quarters of the 200-strong audience stood up and began singing in protest. To the tune of God Bless the USA, the mostly young protesters sang: \u201cSo you claim to be an American, but we see right through your greed, it\u2019s killing right across the world, for all that coal money.\u201d The protesters then left, but the panel was heckled, with angry members of the audience shouting \u201cbunch of liars\u201d and \u201cclean coal is bullshit\u201d. The appearance of an executive from Peabody Energy, the US\u2019s biggest coal miner, was particularly provocative. In 2016, the Guardian revealed the company had funded at least two dozen groups that cast doubt on manmade climate change and oppose environment regulations. Peabody\u2019s Holly Krutka challenged the argument that coal has no future role. \u201cThe discussion needs to be not if we use coal but how,\u201d she said. She also cited carbon capture and storage technology as vital in cutting fossil fuel emissions. Such technology includes the Petra Nova CCS project in the US, which captures CO2 and then uses it to flush more oil out of reservoirs. The UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said that tackling global warming without CCS will be much more expensive. Another panellist, Barry Worthington, executive director of the United States Energy Association, illustrated his points in favour of fossil fuels using future energy projections from ExxonMobil, BP and Statoil. He said US energy companies were already cutting carbon and was the only panellist to back Trump\u2019s Paris pullout, saying: \u201cFrankly, we don\u2019t need the Paris plan.\u201d But the US event prompted fierce criticism at the climate summit, where countries are working to implement the landmark 2015 Paris agreement. Coal is both the dirtiest fossil fuel and a cause of air pollution that causes millions of early deaths every year. \u201cIf the [Trump] administration won\u2019t lead, it should at least get out of the way.,\u201d said Bloomberg, who is also a backer of \u201cAmerica\u2019s pledge\u201d. That effort saw 20 states, more than 50 big cities and 60 big businesses confirm their commitment to the Paris goals on Saturday \u2013 a group that would have the third biggest economy in the world if it were a country. Kibiti said: \u201cMore coal is not going to end the problem of people living without electricity. The vast majority \u2013 84% \u2013 of electricity-poor households globally are in rural areas, so off-grid solutions powered by renewables like solar, wind and small hydro are going to be the cheapest and quickest.\u201d \u201cExploiting poor, disadvantaged populations to justify continued fossil fuel usage is a despicable breach of humanity,\u201d said Kathy Egland, at the NAACP in the US. \u201cThe Trump team promoting this abomination are exhibiting the depth of greed, lack of morality and lengths the fossil industry will go to maintain their wealth.\u201d Saleemul Huq, director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Bangladesh, who advises some of the least developed countries, said: \u201cAny country or company continuing to champion coal and even other fossil fuels from now on would be wilfully carrying out a crime against humanity.\u201d Professor Piers Forster, at the University of Leeds, UK, said: \u201cCoal is not clean \u2013 it is dangerous. [Coal emissions] have to rapidly reduce to zero. Those who argue coal has a future are putting the planet under real risk.\u201d Two dozen of the 196 countries backing the Paris agreement have included efficient coal technology in their national contributions to cutting emissions. But predictions for future coal use have the plummeted in recent years as the cost of renewable energy has dropped. In 2013, the International Energy Agency expected coal-burning to grow by 40% by 2040; today it anticipates just 1% growth, while China and India have recently cancelled plans for hundreds of new coal plants. Andrew Steer, CEO of the World Resources Institute, said the US event was irrelevant: \u201cIt is a total distraction. It will not change the overwhelming momentum away from coal. The closing of coal plants in the US has accelerated since Trump was elected. It\u2019s King Canute trying to hold back the tide.\u201d Earlier on Monday in Bonn, the US\u2019s neighbours Canada and Mexico further isolated Washington by announcing a new partnership with the 15 US states that have pledged strong climate action. Canada\u2019s environment minister, Catherine McKenna, and her Mexican counterpart, Rodolfo Lacy, joined with the governors of Washington state and California, Jay Inslee and Jerry Brown, to form a group that will focus on phasing out coal power and boosting clean power and transport. \u201cWe are all in this together,\u201d said McKenna. \u201cThe countries that move forward and realise there is a $30tn opportunity will be creating clean jobs and growing their economy.\u201d Inslee added: \u201cTrump is a blip in history. Not one country has expressed that there is any doubt [about climate action] just because Trump is still a climate denier. He can tweet his fingers off, but he won\u2019t stop us. If you want to grow your economy, focus on the jobs of the future.\u201d The global campaign to phase out coal use received a boost last week when Bloomberg donated $50m. He has given $164m to anti-coal efforts in the US in the last six years, during which time half of US coal power plants have closed or been cancelled."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
