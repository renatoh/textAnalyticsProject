The lasting image of the World Cup may be Jonny Wilkinson's extra-time drop-goal which took England to victory over Australia but the theme for the first month was the hardship suffered by countries like Samoa, Fiji, Tonga, Romania, Canada, Georgia and Namibia who all begged for financial and practical help from the world's elite. They are receiving their response today as the Rugby Football Union, the richest in the world which is anticipating a 20% increase in its \u00a371m annual turnover because of the World Cup success, pats itself on the back. A year ago, when the International Rugby Board tried to arrange a match at Twickenham between the northern and southern hemispheres to raise funds for the developing nations, the various players' associations around the world, made up largely of the leading five nations, said their members would boycott the event because it was a game too far in an already crowded year. The players, many of whom enjoy annual salaries above the income received by some unions, were not going to receive that much, in relative terms, for turning up. The whole point of the fixture was lost on them as their association leaders demanded suitable recompense. Greed and selfishness prevailed. Today's fixture is going ahead because Twickenham persuaded the 12 Zurich Premiership clubs to acquiesce. They are each receiving more than \u00a3100,000 while the New Zealand Barbarians, a team made up largely of journeymen, with only two of its starting line-up having played in the World Cup, get nearly \u00a3500,000. For those who most need the money there is nothing. The lesson of the World Cup was that rugby union is not a global game. Its resources need to be spread more widely but ideas to redistribute wealth through gate levies have been steadfastly opposed by the big unions. The England head coach Clive Woodward said yesterday that this afternoon was all about the future, with the majority of his side chosen from outside the World Cup starting XV. It is a future which, for the game, looks sadly like reflecting the recent past.
