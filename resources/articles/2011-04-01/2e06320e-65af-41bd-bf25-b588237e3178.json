And it is surely laughable that a 36-year-old convert to Islam can state that \"the French like the idea of everyone being of the same mould\u2026\" when that is precisely what the burqa or niqab do for the women who wear them. This is not religious wear. The Qur'an has very little to say about the form of dress for men or women other than that it should modest and decent; the diktat comes purely from sharia, which also dictates that a woman's word in court should have only half the value of a man's. Keith Watkins Bath The majority of French citizens wanted this ban, indeed the majority of French Muslims wanted this ban. Isn't that how democracies work or am I missing the point here? Also the deprivation of freedom argument is nonsensical. Democratic civilised societies have laws which by their sheer nature deprive us of freedoms. Imagine what it would be like if this wasn't the case. Austin Radford Dordogne Viv Groskop puts a very anti-Islamic slant on the situation, but as she points out, rather cynically, the law is to prohibit facial dissimulation in a public place; not quite the same thing, as I am sure it would apply to other forms of facial covering such as full helmets rather than just burqas. There is a very real security aspect to face covering. I have no objection to people walking around in burqas, or with cardboard boxes over their heads, but I do think it is extremely discourteous to attempt to engage in conversation with someone else not similarly attired. I think we humans have a justifiable expectation to be able to see people's faces when we converse and particularly their eyes. For this reason, I believe also it is polite to remove very dark glasses when talking face to face. Michael Tong Kingsbridge Devon I fear that the French burqa ban will backfire, turning the women into prisoners within their own homes. Did you know that rickets is staging a comeback? This bone-weakening condition is prevalent among children born to women who don't absorb enough vitamin D through lack of exposure to sunlight. (The very thought of having \"just a piece of cloth\" between my senses and the spring air makes me feel sick.) Mothers-to-be are offered vitamin D supplements, but inevitably some fall through the net. Vera Lustig Walton-on-Thames Surrey Contrary to your article, the burqa ban is not yet in force in Belgium. A law had been voted on before the federal elections of 2010, but due to the collapse of the government the legislative procedure had to be restarted. Recently, a committee of the lower house has again passed the ban, but the law has not yet become final. Dr Tim Corthaut Associate fellow Leuven Centre for Global Governance Studies According to you, Ed Balls, when he was schools secretary, said that he \"would not want to be in the kind of society where people were told how to dress\". Then why on earth didn't he try to ban the compulsory wearing of school uniform? Leon Bunnewell Norwich"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
