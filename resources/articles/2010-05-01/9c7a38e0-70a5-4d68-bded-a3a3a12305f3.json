Dappling shafts of sun turn bluebells to a low running flame, hyacinth scent pooling in still air. Holly brakes, tangles of rowan and birch, and sessile oak saplings, all witness the seethe of spring and battle for light. Beyond Caerwych, within the mountain wall, pasture is flounced with may, its blossom already tinged with brown as June nears. Light breeze from the west scours the stink of it away as the path curves round Y Gyrn into a brief gorge and enters the wild valley leading up to Bryn Cader Faner. I lean on the ffridd gate and look back, the two estuaries of Glaslyn and Dwyryd perfectly framed. North and east the hill outlines are hazy, but draining channels and sand bars below are etched and gleaming, sinuous as a Celtic design. As I climb, clear air sets glints into the ragged coast of Lleyn. I cross the stream and find a rough path mounting the flank of Moel y Geifr, following an excursion of Bill Condry's that leads me to Llyn Caerwych, a tarn high among the hills. Around its margins, black-braided buds of the bog cotton are unfurling pert white flags, and the stonechats are chipping from sentinel rocks. I scout among the rocks, in optimistic quest for the Tunbridge filmy fern that Bill and his great friend Mary Richards of Caerynwch found here many summers ago, but these locational secrets only surrender to persistence. So I repeat Bill's prayer for all these little tarns of the Rhinogydd \u2013 \"Long may they remain, unexploited, tranquil and remote, for the spirit of man needs such retreats\" \u2013 and descend to the estuary shores. A seal noses its way along the flooding channels. One of the Glaslyn ospreys flounders down in untidy stoop, rises again with a mullet in its talons."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
