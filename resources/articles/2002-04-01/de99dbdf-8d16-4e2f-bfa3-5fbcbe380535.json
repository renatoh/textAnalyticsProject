City, relegated last May after a return to the top flight which lasted just one season, are now eight points clear, but were denied promotion this evening by 10-man West Brom who kept the pressure on the top two with a 1-0 win away at Coventry. Kevin Keegan's team now have 90 points with Wolves are West Brom both on 82. City were the better side throughout the top two clash - the 100th meeting between the famous old clubs - and fully deserved the win. Wolves goalkeeper Michael Oakes made a great save to deny Darren Huckerby after 15 minutes but was helpless 20 minutes later when a shot by Wright-Phillips from the edge of the box took a heavy deflection and left the keeper wrong-footed. Jon Macken came within inches of another goal early in the second period and City centre half Steve Howey had an effort disallowed 10 minutes after halftime. Oakes saved well again from Huckerby in the 75th minute but City's relentless pressure paid off 10 minutes from time when Wright-Phillips drove home his second goal from the edge of the box. It got worse for Wolves two minutes later when skipper Paul Butler was sent off for his second booking - a wild lunge on Huckerby."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
