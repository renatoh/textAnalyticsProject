Strappy, white, summery high heels, they arrived the week after I started working from home, a couple of days after the state borders started closing across Australia six months ago. I have never worn them. Since that first lockdown purchase, many parcels have arrived at my house. I bought 12 giant balls of yarn for the thousand knitting projects I had planned (I have finished precisely one). I bought 20kg of bread flour from an upmarket wholesaler when everyone else started making sourdough and cleaning out the supermarket shelves. For the first time in my life I clicked through on a Facebook ad \u2013 and actually purchased. I bought boots I\u2019ve worn twice (to the supermarket), and silk pants I wore out once \u2013 to the hairdresser, in that brief interregnum between lockdown one and two. I ordered colour-depositing hair conditioner when she told me that my follow-up appointment would be at least three months later than we\u2019d planned. Sometimes, the impulse verges on the ridiculous. I decided to start gardening and joined a gardening club, buying seeds and fertiliser, huge trellises and stakes, baby citrus trees, and even fake cabbage moths on sticks online. I really think I hit the peak when I forked out a few hundred dollars on a greenhouse for the increasingly crowded balcony (it has not yet arrived). I\u2019m not alone. A Melbourne colleague sends me her list of purchases. It begins: \u201cA tracksuit\u201d, followed by \u201ca matching tracksuit for my boyfriend\u201d. Many of her purchases are similarly practical but some of them stick out: \u201cAn embroidery kit that I still have not opened. A Christmas present for my mother. Birthday presents for my sister and nephew, both of whom have birthdays in December. A new toiletries case, against the day I can ever travel.\u201d I don\u2019t believe our lockdown purchases can be entirely attributed to necessity or crass consumerism. They are, at turns, products of boredom or impulse, but perhaps they are also manifestations of yearning \u2013 for the return of \u201cnormal times\u201dwhich still feel such a long way off. This week I received an email from Australia Post \u2013 no doubt due to one of the many, many things I have now on order \u2013 saying that networks are increasingly clogged and some days, more than 80% of parcels circulating around Australia are heading to Victoria. Most of my purchases over recent weeks have not yet arrived. I don\u2019t even remember what many of them were. Or perhaps I\u2019m choosing to forget, hoping for a moment of surprise in the relentless repetition of lockdown days when something I forgot about finally turns up at my door.
