I would have taken the team off as a protest. That would have sent a very strong message not just to the Spanish fans responsible for the chants but to the whole world. We all talk a good game after the event, saying how horrible and shocking the racism was, but why not do something at the time? Someone should have said enough's enough, whether it was the England manager, captain or head of the Football Association. Someone from the FA could have come down to the dug-out and said: \"This is unacceptable. Get them off.\" The FA is saying that Uefa and Fifa should do something about the racism. Well do something yourself. Show how brave you are. Taking the team off would have been a great stance. The whole world would have taken notice. It would have done more than any anti-racism T-shirt or any moaning and groaning. It would have been the best thing ever. What I would have done is got the players off and asked for an announcement telling the crowd we would come back on in 10 minutes but that if they then carried on with the racism, that would be it. Game over and you've wasted your money. I would have loved to see the look on the faces of the Spanish fans if England had walked off, and I don't see why that couldn't have happened. Because it was just a friendly, it would have been easier than in a competitive match. People might argue that taking the team off would have set a dangerous precedent. In future if a crowd somewhere wanted to stop a big World Cup qualifier against England because their team were 2-0 down, would they then try on the racism? But England wouldn't be obliged to do the same thing again and still could have made a very big point on Wednesday. We've killed off racism in football stadiums in Britain and I think our game can be used as an example around the world, especially in England because unfortunately you still have Celtic and Rangers supporters doing their stuff. English football in general can be a model for any business in any country in terms of different cultures working together. I have to go back a long way to the last time I heard players being racially abused in England. It was happening 20 years ago when I joined Manchester United and played with Paul McGrath and Remi Moses. About 10 years ago I went to a game somewhere and heard someone say something racist and I turned to my wife and said: \"Have I heard that right?\" It has to be said that what happened in Madrid was not indicative of what most Spaniards feel. I love Spain and their culture and could live there no problem. I've been to a lot of games there and never heard any sort of racism. I wonder whether some fans behaved the way they did against England because of the whole business with their coach Luis Aragon\u00e9s and the reaction in England to the way he referred to Thierry Henry during a training session. Nothing excuses what happened, but maybe they felt the English had been having a dig at Aragon\u00e9s because he was Spanish and were backing their manager. I'm not saying that's right but I'm asking people to think about it. I thought England's black players handled themselves brilliantly. They stayed calm and showed how strong-minded they are. They will have been disgusted by the racism but as a footballer you tend to hurt more for a mate than for yourself. Players are thick-skinned and can take what's thrown at them. I got called all sorts: ugly, big nose, ginger and took abuse for being Scottish. I've had loads of stick for being relegated but what's worse is seeing your friends getting it. Most things I can deal with but not injustice, and what happened in Spain was so unacceptable that I would have reacted. I stayed on the pitch once after being sent off in a reserve game for Coventry because I felt it was an injustice. A West Brom player said something behind the referee's back and I got a red card. The referee and linesmen ended up walking off because the referee said: \"Either you go or I do.\" I said: \"Fine, cheerio then.\" They sat in the dressing room until Ron Atkinson, who was the Coventry manager, came and convinced me I should go. I was his assistant so I was setting a great example. As a manager the only times I've been close to taking a team off have been in friendlies when opponents were kicking 10 bells out of your players. I've told the referee to sort it out or I'll take my team off. I've never had to go through with one of those threats but I would have taken England off on Wednesday night."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
