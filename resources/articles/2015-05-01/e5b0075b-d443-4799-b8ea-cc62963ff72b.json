The recommendations will inform a final decision by the UN\u2019s world heritage committee next month, which, if in favour of declaring the reef in danger, would herald a new era of outside scrutiny of its care. Federal and state ministers are reportedly confident that the scale of their investments and legislation to tackle reef threats \u2013 as well as an unprecedented lobbying effort by the Abbott government \u2013 will be enough to spare them the embarrassment of a listing. A listing, which would place the reef in the same category as the polluted Everglades national park in the US, would usher in yearly checks by the UN and would likely cause a jolt to a tourism industry worth $6bn. Environmentalists say that regardless of Australia\u2019s ability to sway Unesco, the reef remains imperilled, with its health in long-term decline and threats increasing. Greenpeace political advisor Jessica Panegyres said that the decline meant Unesco was unlikely to give the reef the \u201cclean bill of health\u201d Australian governments were seeking. That scenario would see a listing ruled out and a UN check not due for another five years. Panegyres said another possible outcome was Unesco refraining from a listing this time but threatening to impose one if it found evidence of a decline in another two to five years. Australia\u2019s Reef 2050 Long-Term Sustainability Plan sets targets to cut pollution running on to the reef, including an 80% reduction in nitrogen and a 50% cut in sediment by 2025. The plan was updated months ago to include policies from the new Queensland Labor government which environmental groups welcomed, including a promise to ban the dumping of capital dredged sediment in the reef world heritage area and give $100m over five years to lift water quality. The federal government is banning dumping in the reef\u2019s marine park and giving a further $100m in funding for the Reef Trust, a body that will work with landowners to stop chemicals flowing into the coral ecosystem. A new independent scientific panel, headed by the chief government scientist Ian Chubb, will oversee the trust\u2019s work. Australia\u2019s plan has been accompanied by a vigorous lobbying effort, including among the country\u2019s Asian neighbours. The Queensland government will send its key political performer \u2013 deputy premier Jackie Trad \u2013 along with environment minister Steven Miles, to join the federal environment minister Greg Hunt in Bonn for the world heritage committee deliberations from 28 June. The draft decision, which Panegyres said would likely form the basis of the final ruling unless it was perceived as particularly \u201csoft or controversial\u201d, will be released in Paris at 1am AEST on Saturday. Panegyres said, regardless of the outcome, it was Greenpeace\u2019s position that the reef was genuinely in danger, with a 50% loss of coral cover over 30 years among the key measures showing it was in continuous decline. The government\u2019s own outlook report identified that half of the identified measures of world heritage values, from dugongs to threatened species habitats, were in decline. Meanwhile, the trajectory of the impacts was increasing, including the reef\u2019s most serious long-term threat, climate change. Respected coral reef researchers Terry Hughes and Jon Day of James Cook university have said that the opening of new coal mines \u2013 a reference to plans for central Queensland\u2019s Galilee basin \u2013 are \u201ctoo risky\u201d for the reef. However, both state and federal governments remain supportive of proposals by mining corporations to open massive new mines in the Galilee, which would increase shipping traffic through reef waters and industrial activity on the coast through port expansion. Panegyres said while the Queensland government gained kudos through some of its dredge-dumping bans and its water quality investments, it \u201cwanted to have its cake and eat it too\u201d through its support of new mines. Hughes and Day have also called for even tighter restrictions on dredging, with dumping of spoil still allowed in the reef\u2019s world heritage area if it is from \u201cmaintenance\u201d dredging. Panegyres said potentially \u201cdisastrous\u201d dredging in existing port areas like Gladstone was still allowed. \u201cThe point is the reef is on a knife edge, it\u2019s in a critical state, so why are we subjecting it to more harm, particularly when that exact harm will also drive climate change, which is the greatest long-term threat to the reef,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
