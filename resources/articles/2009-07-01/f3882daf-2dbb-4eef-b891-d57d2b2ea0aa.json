Says Simon Chilvers Don't people get their knickers in a knot about men wearing shorts? As long as they're the right shorts, what's the problem? I have worn a pair of tailored city shorts to two summer weddings in recent years. Both times I felt liberated by the experience and found myself accosted by curious men \u2013 the bulk of whom simply wished they'd thought of the idea themselves. Getting your legs out initially feels weird but you soon appreciate the cooling effect. I also felt more relaxed in shorts \u2013 not that I skimped on smartness. On both occasions I wore a blazer, a shirt with a tie and smart shoes (crucially with invisible socks) recreating the traditional suit look, minus a little extra fabric. I had swerved shorts entirely for years. The appeal of cargos, with all those pockets bulging, was lost on me. Board shorts only work if you're on a surf or skate board \u2013 hence the name. This left only the horror of a three-quarter-length trouser as a summer legwear option. I would never have worn shorts to work because they were just far too \"holiday wardrobe\". So the arrival of the city short, cut more like a trouser, has given shorts some versatility. It seems I am not alone in my enthusiasm. John Lewis reports its pinstripe short has been selling 50% faster than its classic chino style. Lee Hamilton, men's formal-wear buyer for the store, attributes this success to the weather and a general high street trend for a slimmer, tailored look, which the city short slots perfectly into. At River Island the city short is also a hit. \"They look easy and sporty with casual polos and plimsolls, and also look great with neat short-sleeved shirts and deck shoes for a preppy look,\" says Sarah Turton, menswear design director. At the 2006 menswear shows, the emergence of smarter, unfussy shorts at labels such as Yves Saint Laurent and Louis Vuitton first indicated a shift. Vuitton presented a neat navy short worn just above the knee with a blazer and tie. Fast-forward to the following spring/summer and almost every catwalk featured a variation on this tarted-up short theme. In 2008, the short-suit became the logical next step. Robert Johnston, associate editor of GQ, worries about this development. \"It's too much of a 'look',\" he says. \"You end up dressing like a fashion stylist.\" But if, like me, you're feeling game, Johnston advises opting for a dark or navy short-suit, worn with a clunky brogue, \"as they're masculine and will balance the look out\". I agree \u2013 even when I wear a T-shirt with my city shorts, I prefer smarter shoes. It seems to give the whole outfit a more grownup feel: you need to stand up straight in city shorts. However, with a very glamorous wedding to attend in Ibiza next month, I have my eye on a pair of purple, straight-cut Acne shorts, which I feel may be screaming for a sandal. NO! Says Tim Dowling I have never considered shorts an item of fashion. As far as I'm concerned they don't even count as being all-the-way dressed. I wear the same pair year after year until the pockets go and they start literally costing me money. They're fine when you're on holiday in a country where your status as a tourist makes you unsightly anyway, but they're far too jaunty for any sort of formal occasion \u2013 a wedding, say \u2013 where your role as a middle-aged man is to bring everybody down a little bit. I'd never heard the term \"city short\" before. It sounded less a fashion trend than a vaguely hopeful oxymoron, like \"rural bus service\". When the John Lewis PR offers to send me a pair of city shorts, I suffer a momentary failure of nerve. What shoes would I wear with them? \"Trainers, or loafers, or brogues,\" he says. \"Anything you can wear without socks.\" You can wear brogues without socks? Since when? Have I woken up in some future dystopia? The shorts aren't that revolutionary: flat-fronted and slim, in a dark grey herringbone fabric. They look like my suit trousers, only shorter; they reach to just below the kneecap. I pair them with a polo shirt. \"How do I look?\" I ask my sons. \"Like you're wearing a school uniform,\" says one of them. He isn't wrong. When I put on the jacket of the aforementioned suit, I instantly recognise the man in the mirror as AC/DC guitarist Angus Young. According to Adrian Edwards, head of menswear buying at John Lewis, \"the city short is fast becoming a wardrobe must-have\". It is perhaps a testament to how impressionable I am (and to how rarely I leave the house) that on the strength of this single statement I fully expect every man on the tube platform to be wearing tailored knee-length shorts. I am the only one. It might be the weather \u2013 it is raining a little \u2013 or it might be the area. I am beginning to feel slightly self-conscious. Self-conscious, and cold. At the Guardian's offices I keep a mental tally of all the men who wore shorts to work today: approximately none. Just me. This minor breach of protocol makes me feel like someone who readily makes sacrifices for the sake of style, even though nothing could be further from the truth. On my way home, while contemplating my vogueish reflection in a window, I am passed by another man wearing city shorts. His are teamed with black brogues, and black socks. That's a look I might save for next summer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
