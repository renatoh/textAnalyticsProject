But medical experts have warned against drawing conclusions so early in investigation of the virus, which has infected 24,500 people, mostly in China. \u201cWe\u2019re still in the deep learning curve about this virus,\u201d said Dr Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. Hotez developed a vaccine for Sars, another coronavirus which spread in China in 2003. \u201cThere\u2019s more we don\u2019t know than we do know\u201d about the new coronavirus, he said. Some viruses can be passed from mother to child through breastmilk or through the placenta during pregnancy. Such cases of maternal transmission are called \u201cvertical transmission\u201d. Such transmission does happen in rubella \u2013 also known as German measles or three-day measles \u2013 and, in some cases, in HIV. But such behavior in viruses is uncommon, said Hotez, especially among respiratory illnesses such as the coronavirus. Viruses that can be transmitted through the placenta, or intrauterine, are even more uncommon. \u201cWe know it happens for instance in HIV-Aids, but even there in the pre-retroviral drug era when I was taking care of infants with Aids, even in untreated mothers it was still only about 25% [of cases],\u201d said Hotez. A doctor in Wuhan, the city in Hubei province, at the center of the coronavirus outbreak, set off speculation after he mentioned doctors needed to be on the lookout for vertical transmission in a report on Chinese state media. Zeng Lingkong, the chief physician of Wuhan children hospital\u2019s neonatal medicine department, said, according to Agence France-Presse: \u201cThis reminds us to pay attention to mother-to-child being a possible route of coronavirus transmission.\u201d Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said that when women give birth vaginally, babies are exposed to microbes present in the the mother\u2019s body. \u201cAs far as I am aware there is currently no evidence that the novel coronavirus can be transmitted in the womb,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a baby does get infected with coronavirus a few days after birth we currently cannot tell if the baby was infected in the womb or during birth.\u201d Hunter said that one study showed that coronaviruses (which include Mers and Sars) are more likely to increase risk of a miscarriage than be passed on in the womb."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
