Revealing its \u00a3200m proposal, which also includes more than 2,000 homes that will help pay for it, to the City, the studio said the development would help secure the future of the British creative industries for the next 70 years, and lure Hollywood talent to the UK. The idea is backed by some of the biggest names in British film including Sir Ridley Scott and Richard Curtis. The Buckinghamshire studio, made famous in the 1960s by its association with the James Bond and Carry On films, has hosted scores of British-made films and TV series down the years. The new \"media park\" will include a re-creation of a Venetian square, Lake Como in Italy, central Paris and surburban Britain. Chief executive Ivan Dunleavy said he was confident the scheme would win planning permission, despite the proposed expansion being on green belt land. The planning process will take at least 18 months. Dunleavy said the new locations would allow Pinewood Shepperton to compete better with the northern and eastern European locations that have lured film-makers in recent years. \"The creative industries as a whole are a big part of the UK economy, representing \u00a360.8bn of GDP. Film and television are a big, high-profile part of that. For good cultural and economic reasons, the industry is important,\" he said. Lord Puttnam, film director and Channel 4 deputy chairman, said the inclusion of the latest digital technology and training infrastructure would help keep Britain at \"the heart of the global creative network\". Following a period of uncertainty for British studios when tax breaks for film-makers were under threat, a new deal agreed by the then chancellor, Gordon Brown, helped boost bookings at the studio for British and US productions. The relative strength of the pound against the dollar has also helped it compete with US rivals, with United 93, The Bourne Ultimatum, Atonement and Stardust among the recent hits that have been filmed at Pinewood. The BBC1 soap EastEnders is understood to be on the verge of moving from its current home in Elstree to Pinewood. ITV chairman Michael Grade remains non-executive chairman of Pinewood and played a key role in arguing for the ambitious expansion. The residential apartments to be built on the site will be integrated with the film sets, the company said. It promised they would include affordable housing for students and those involved in the arts, and comprise a mixture of property for rent and for sale. Curtis, who had a long career in television before going on to direct films, said it was \"a tremendous project, particularly for people who don't want to spend most of their lives in eastern Europe\". He added: \"The practical benefits for film and television makers could be enormous, creating movies in one place, not several locations, and being right next to all the best film facilities.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
