The study, by Macmillan Cancer Support, found fear levels among UK cancer sufferers have been so high that 270,000 people have experienced panic or anxiety attacks or even suicidal thoughts because of coronavirus. Since the start of the pandemic, over half a million people with cancer have barely left their homes and around a fifth of them say they will stay indoors until a vaccine or effective treatment is widely available, regardless of recent changes to government shielding guidance, the charity found following a survey this month. Last week, ministers loosened shielding guidance for the most vulnerable, allowing them to meet in a group of up to six people outdoors, including people from different households, while maintaining strict physical distancing. The new guidelines also mean they can form \u201csupport bubbles\u201d with one other household with overnight stays in each other\u2019s homes without any restrictions. But the guidance has caused a lot of distress for many people with cancer, according to Macmillan\u2019s chief executive, Lynda Thomas, who said they feel \u201clost in lockdown\u201d. Sufferers have said they are not sure what to do. \u201cFor many people it is more frightening to be diagnosed with cancer now than during any other time in recent history,\u201d she said. The research also suggested people with cancer have been shielding themselves in larger numbers than those deemed extremely clinically vulnerable to coronavirus. \u201cThe changing shielding guidance just adds to the panic and stress that is already going on for me,\u201d said Michelle, 21, from Essex, who was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma for the second time in April 2020 and is shielding with her family and girlfriend. \u201cThe virus isn\u2019t going to evaporate overnight, so I feel it\u2019s just not worth the risk of going outside.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve grown accustomed to the \u2018stay home\u2019 message, and now the idea of shielding lifting and returning to some semblance of normality is scary,\u201d said Deb, 55, from London, a single mother with breast cancer shielding with her teenage twins. \u201cWe are all petrified of the implications of the virus. I had become hugely anxious and torn about what to do for the best.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
