The free exhibition will bring together religious paintings from the gallery\u2019s collection with modern and contemporary works. \u201cIt is important to show that this is not just a historical phenomenon,\u201d said the curator Joost Joustra. \u201cThat it is an ongoing fascination and that artists have dealt with it for hundreds of years and are still doing it.\u201d Asked whether there was a lot of sin at the gallery, Joustra said: \u201cIn the pictures there is. Otherwise not so much.\u201d The Emin work going on display will be a neon, titled It was just a kiss. \u201cI read that as a sort of confession and confession is an important subject when it comes to sin,\u201d said Joustra. Warhol will be represented by Repent and Sin No More!, a work that has the feel of leaflets which today are still thrust on people in the streets. Works from the gallery\u2019s collection include paintings by Cranach the Elder, Bronzino, Jan Steen and William Hogarth. One of the stars will be Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s The Immaculate Conception, which is all about the Virgin Mary being born without sin. \u201cIt is a very beautiful picture to look at and if you walk by it you don\u2019t necessarily associate it with sin,\u201d said Joustra. \u201cBut it is very much about sin.\u201d One purpose of the show is to encourage people to think about their own definition of sin, how it is universal yet highly personal. As well as Sin the gallery also announced the first ever display in the UK of one of Poland\u2019s most important paintings. The 10ft picture of the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus by Jan Matejko rarely leaves its home in the Senate Chamber of the Jagiellonian University, Krakow, but will go on show at the National Gallery between 29 July-15 November. Sin will show at the National Gallery from 15 April to 5 July 2020"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
