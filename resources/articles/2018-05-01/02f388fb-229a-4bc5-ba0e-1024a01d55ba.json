Delph\u2019s wife, Natalie, is due on 30 June, two days after England play Belgium in their final group game in Kaliningrad. The Manchester City player has discussed the situation with Southgate. \u201cGareth\u2019s been absolutely fantastic,\u201d Delph said. \u201cThere\u2019s not just me, there\u2019s Phil Jones as well \u2013 I think his wife\u2019s expecting. There\u2019s nothing more important than family to me \u2013 it always comes first and always will. If I do have the opportunity to get back [home], I will. But if not, she\u2019s tough, she\u2019ll deal with it. We\u2019re not 100% certain [what will occur] \u2013 but because the game is on the 28th there might be an opportunity to fly back and then get back fast.\u201d Delph was called by his wife about another matter after he forgot to bring an essential item to England\u2019s St George\u2019s Park training base. \u201cI met her when I was at Leeds \u2013 she\u2019s from Yorkshire so there\u2019s only Yorkshire Tea bags in my house but I forgot them. She rang me saying: \u2018You\u2019ve forgot your tea bags.\u2019 One hundred per cent, I will take them to Russia.\u201d Delph\u2019s selection by Southgate was a fitting bookend to a personal season of triumph after Pep Guardiola nearly sold him to Stoke City last summer, and he finished with a Premier League winners\u2019 medal. The 28-year-old made 29 appearances in all competitions, becoming Guardiola\u2019s first-choice left-back after Benjamin Mendy\u2019s serious knee injury in September. \u201cIt was tricky for me at the start, because I wasn\u2019t sure where I was going to be club-wise, and there was a lot of talk about me moving on and whether I was going to stay,\u201d said Delph, who is listed by Southgate as a midfielder but emphasised that he is happy to play anywhere. \u201cBut I managed to stay at Man City. It was unfortunate for Benjamin Mendy, because there were big hopes surrounding him and with him playing in the team it would have been a different style of football, an exciting style. \u201cBut I managed to sneak in there at left-back and managed to get quite a few games. I played there as a young kid but not many times. I played there probably one or two times under G\u00e9rard Houllier at Aston Villa, but not really.\u201d Delph joined City from Villa in July 2015 after performing two U-turns, first reversing a decision to leave, then changing his mind again. \u201cI was fully committed to staying at Aston Villa,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reason I didn\u2019t was because the signings we were going to bring in to strengthen to guarantee we wouldn\u2019t be fighting relegation \u2013 that never happened. The opportunity to go and win the Premier League, to compete in or win a Champions League, was too big an opportunity to miss. \u201cIt obviously didn\u2019t go down well because I came out and said I was staying. I spoke to the club and the club came out with a statement and it\u2019s okayed [but] a lot of stuff got mixed up. I\u2019ve never had the opportunity to come out and speak about it. The situation basically was, for three or four years, I was fighting week in, week out to help the team not get relegated and it takes its toll on you. \u201cFor me it was the fact that staff would lose their jobs \u2013 I had a great relationship with them, the kitchen staff, kit men, cleaners, absolutely everyone. I loved the club so for me to then go was hard.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
