The Guardian has obtained a copy of the confidential investment prospectus prepared for Arsenal's 15.9% shareholder, Lady Bracewell-Smith. The document, entitled \"Arsenal Football Club: Unique Investment Opportunity\", contains clear evidence that Blackstone, a US-based finance house, has been holding active negotiations with potential purchasers of her stake. Although news of Bracewell-Smith's having engaged the broker did not emerge until last month, it appears Blackstone had already received some indicative interest, as far back as last October. \"Arsenal's key metrics have significantly improved since initial discussions in October, with its share price, revenue and EBITDA [operating profits before the deduction of tax, interest and accounting write-downs] all rising while its net debt has fallen,\" the document states. Blackstone is known to be pushing the share sale in the US and the Far East, particularly China, areas where its client base is broadest. And the document's claims give rise to fears that a fresh takeover battle could soon ensue. Since first investing in Arsenal three years ago \u2013 following which he has built the largest single shareholding in the club, of 29.9% \u2013 Stan Kroenke has ensured a balance of power in the Arsenal boardroom by forging an alliance with the most influential shareholder, Danny Fiszman. But although that has so far proved sufficient to ward off a full takeover bid by Alisher Usmanov, Bracewell-Smith's endeavours could shatter the status quo. The document markets Arsenal as a \"unique asset with huge scarcity value\". The club are, it adds: \"One of only a handful of available English clubs following a chain of recent transactions.\" With Kroenke on the Arsenal board and Usmanov declared a \"long-term investor\", the claim that Arsenal are \"available\" might seem to stretch credulity. However, there may be good reason why Bracewell-Smith would consider her stake, derived from a dynastic investment held by the family she married into, as the gateway to full control of Arsenal. She is looking to sell her 9,893 shares for up to \u00a3158m. That represents a 60% premium on the current \u00a310,000-a-share market price. And analysts believe that if she does achieve a bid in the \u00a313,000 to \u00a315,000-a-share range the document suggests \u2013 this is the \"implied share price\", according to Blackstone's calculations \u2013 then it could trigger sales by the holders of the other significant stakes in the club. Kroenke's acquisitions have been conducted at an average price of little more than \u00a37,000 per share, implying a potential 100% profit on his investment in what has been a collapsing asset market over the past three years. But while that may persuade Kroenke to cash in, Usmanov is believed to have other designs. Senior figures in his Red &amp; White Holdings investment vehicle are believed to have told friends he would prefer to build a strategic alliance with the purchaser of Bracewell-Smith's stake and remain as a minority investor. \"While Arsenal's shares currently trade at \u00a310k per share, the market is highly illiquid and might therefore not necessarily reflect the true value of the club,\" adds the document. \"Additionally, Arsenal has significant upside potential relative to other comparable.\" Blackstone makes great play of on-the-pitch progress under Wenger, his consistent top-four finishes and the club's top-five position in the Uefa European club rankings. But Arsenal's chances of achieving a repeat performance in the expected absence of their captain next season will doubtless be reduced. Indeed it is clear from Blackstone's analysis of the club's current financial position \u2013 an insight afforded to very few, since the club's 2010 annual accounts will not publicly be available for at least six months \u2013 that even the \u00a340m transfer fee Arsenal are holding out for would be scant compensation. That is because after making profits before tax in excess of \u00a345m on revenues of \u00a3316m in the year ending May 2009, Blackstone's well-informed projections are for turnover to rise to \u00a3353.3m, generating a \u00a355.8m profit before tax. According to the document, that will boost Arsenal's cash reserve beyond \u00a3100m; but that money alone will not yield their first trophy in six otherwise barren years. Loans on borrowed time The former Citigroup investment banker Michael Klein was a prime mover in Liverpool's success in extending their \u00a3297m loans with the Royal Bank of Scotland last month. An American, Klein goes back a long way with the Liverpool co-owner Tom Hicks and is believed to have been instrumental in persuading RBS not to pull the plug on the club for at least another year. The refinancing came with three conditions: that Hicks and his co-owner, George Gillett, invest equity (they pumped in \u00a386m), that a new chairman be installed and that a third party be engaged to find new owners. Klein is believed to have persuaded RBS that this was sufficient reason to sustain the club. But although Klein turned to old associates in the new chairman, Martin Broughton, and Barcap, a Barclays subsidiary, few expect them to be successful. Pulis on the up Tony Pulis has not only climbed a mountain to keep Stoke City in the Premier League, he is doing the same in the close season. The manager is leading a team of charity fundraisers against a team including David Seaman in an ascent of Kilimanjaro. They began their climb yesterday. Triesman thorn for Spurs Tottenham Hotspur face an unexpected dilemma while thinking over how to strengthen their team ahead of their Champions League play-off next season. Do they stick with the man whose loose talk may well have torpedoed England's 2018 World Cup bid? For after losing his chairmanships of England 2018 and the Football Association, Lord Triesman, pictured, retains one post in football: that of patron of the Tottenham Hotspur Foundation, a position he took before his \u00a3250,000-a-year Wembley jobs. Adding to the intrigue is that Sir Keith Mills, one of the prime movers in tumbling Triesman's football-career dominoes from within the 2018 board, is a nonexecutive director at White Hart Lane."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
