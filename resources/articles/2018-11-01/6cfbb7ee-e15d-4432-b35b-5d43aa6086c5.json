As the city, which is one of the most dangerous in the world, prepares itself for the arrival of an estimated 5,000-7,000 people including world leaders, CEOs and journalists, we asked our Papua New Guinean readers what they thought of their country, the poorest in the Apec bloc, hosting the meeting. We received more than 200 responses to our call-out. The general feeling was anger, with more than two-thirds saying they felt only negative about Apec coming to PNG. \u201cI hate it,\u201d wrote one person living in East New Britain province. \u201cThere is no other way to say it. When I hear the acronym Apec it makes me cringe.\u201d Many spoke of their anger at what they perceive as excessive spending on Apec at a time when the country is battling a polio outbreak, increased rates of malaria, tuberculosis and funding shortages for education and health services. A large number raised the government\u2019s purchase of 40 Maseratis and three super-luxury Bentleys. Many expressed the view that the benefits of Apec would only be felt in Port Moresby, where less than 5% of the population live. One person, asked if they thought PNG would benefit, said: \u201cWell, Lae [the second largest city in PNG] got the grass mowed around the old Botanical Gardens, so hey, there\u2019s that.\u201d Here are the views of eight residents of Papua New Guinea. \u2018Initially I was ecstatic, now I\u2019m worried\u2019 Nona Susanti Diya, 39, Port Moresby, working for an Australian-funded project Initially, when I first heard that PNG would host such a world event, I was ecstatic and really proud of my country and the government. But then when I realised all these unnecessary infrastructure being funded on loan and implemented by the Chinese, I started to get worried. On top of that, it was common knowledge that our country is broke and so that got me even more concerned. Will it have a positive impact? I\u2019d like to believe it will. But honestly, I don\u2019t know anymore. I\u2019m afraid that the Chinese will take over this country and we will be second citizens in our own country. Our government has clearly demonstrated their ability to spend money and make bad investments. \u2018My head hurts just talking about this\u2019 David Boga, 39, Port Moresby, works for an airline company It is always a good thing to host a global event such as Apec and I would welcome it if PNG is economically ready which we are sadly not. Our health system is in a sad state. Hospitals are running out of drugs and people are dying of curable diseases. Yes, it might be 2018 to the rest the world but it is some dog years back for us. Teachers on government payrolls are having their salary cut with no explanation at all. You just cannot mess with health and education. If only PNG acted like a developing nation instead of pretending to be a developed one. You might have heard about the purchase of 40 Maseratis, a couple of Bentleys and a few more vehicles amounting up to millions of kina. The money that could have solved the health and education problems. I don\u2019t know what our government is trying to prove... My head hurts just talking about this. \u2018Build it and they will come\u2019 Angela Tomkins, cultural officer I personally think it is brilliant. I know it costs a lot of money for infrastructure, but build it and they will come. Countries are like water \u2013 if you don\u2019t move forward you stagnate. What needs to happen is there needs to be a balance between all things. Surely the money coming it to help host Apec including tax credit scheme options is contributing to the economy even in the form of infrastructure. \u2018In the highlands, no one knows what Apec is and no one cares\u2019 Isaiah Tare, 23, lives in Port Moresby, from Enga, university student My local community is situated in the rugged highlands terrain of Papua New Guinea. People are busy struggling to survive everyday, no one knows what Apec is and no one really cares. Of course, the few educated elites know what Apec is in essence but the majority of the people back in my local community are busy recovering from a tribal war sparked from the 2017 national elections. Houses were burnt, people were killed, the whole town came to a halt, schools were closed, it was total chaos! People are too busy struggling to just survive - Apec or no Apec. However, there have been a lot of changes in Port Moresby all because of Apec \u2026 The fast paving of roads within the city, erections of buildings and safety and security measures to make sure Apec runs effectively has displaced many people and has put a stop to their form of daily sustenance. What are these portion of the population going to do while we are busy discussing \u2018economic integration\u2019 in our posh hotels, eating fancy food and travelling in recently purchased million kina Maseratis? \u2018PNG is drowning\u2019 Samantha Michael, 22, Port Moresby, university student I think the government didn\u2019t think it through when they put their hands up to host. The country is not ready for an event like this, and the timing couldn\u2019t be more wrong. PNG is drowning, both economically and socially. We are facing bankruptcy, our health services are declining rapidly, our education sector is suffering; we can\u2019t afford to pay our teachers their salaries. The only places that saw any improvements were those along the Apec routes. They even tore up and resealed roads that were perfectly fine. The rest of the city however is still stuck with terrible roads and infrastructure from the 90s and 80s. \u2018Apec is not a magic pill\u2019 Patrick Kaiku, 38, Port Moresby, academic It is simply a sad case of wrong priorities. It does not serve the national interest when the social and economic plight of the country is sacrificed to conduct a superficial and extravagant event. The effects will be negative. PNG, and especially Port Moresby, has an already bad image problem overseas due to law and order, corruption and a range of other issues. Apec is not a magic pill. Apec is touted by Papua New Guinea leaders as the opportunity to fix the image problem of PNG. But the reality is that the public service and other agencies of Government will not embrace the legacy of Apec after it is done in November. When Apec is completed in PNG, the same complacency, ineptness and corruption will continue. \u2018Such events give us hope\u2019 Jordan Peara, 24, from the highlands, university student PNG might struggle with health, education and safety problems, including a resurgence of polio, but such events gives us hope. We have so much to offer to the world. I want to take this as an opportunity and put aside our in-house quarrels and negativity for a while. Hosting Apec tells the world that we are not cannibals, primitive, dumb and poor as labelled. We are nation capable of hosting world events. We might scramble to prepare buildings, accommodation and infrastructure, pay might reduce, stocks price might increase and my life and everyone\u2019s lives might be affected for the time-being but having connection with the world and being part of the community, our future is much brighter. Such events open doors to the trade world. Such events provide opportunity for simple local farmers to market their produce in international markets. It opens opportunities for PNG students to access top universities in other parts of the world. It provides opportunities for local researchers to collaborate easily with best scientists around the world. It showcases the diverse beautiful cultures of PNG to the world. It creates opportunities for PNG to gain and share knowledge and technologies. \u2018Leaders should boycott Apec\u2019 Louisa Dira, 40, Port Moresby, works for a development program PNG was never ready to host an event like Apec! The Apec leaders know PNG is the poorest of the Apec nations. If the leaders are human enough with compassion, they will show support to the affected peoples by boycotting Apec or not riding in the Maseratis.
