Ironically, the very reasons that Barney Ronay gave to contend the Boat Race no longer justifies a live broadcast on terrestrial television belong firmly in the past themselves. The Boat Race has moved on in so many respects from its portrayal as an elitist, irrelevant tradition. Seven of the GB rowers who returned from Beijing with Olympic medals this year are former Boat Race competitors and will testify to the benefits the race and its preparations gave them. Yes foreign students do row in the race, but half of those who contested the event last year were home-grown talent and 21 British students are looking for places in next year's boats in trials taking place over the next week. Let's not forget that these are the rowers who could well be seeking medals for the GB team at London 2012. And while they may not all originate from inner city areas, the trialists include students from Bradford, Birmingham, Macclesfield, Sheffield and Swindon who have to qualify academically before they start rowing. Although they are amateurs, they invariably produce a world-class performance on the day on a unique tideway course that is three times the length of a conventional rowing event. Unlike many celebrated sportsmen today, they don't receive payment or anything for finishing second \u2014 not even a medal to recognise the effort involved. Yet they train twice a day, six days a week for seven months. As such, the Boat Race is about pure sport \u2014 a winner taking all. Only a handful of people have the skill, mindset and opportunity to race a formula one car, but it doesn't mean that television viewers or spectators do not view a race as sport. And it is clear from the viewing figures and level of media interest, that the British public, as well as millions around the world, appreciate the special sporting nature of the event and its place in the annual calendar. Who cares about it? Well, apart from ITV's 7.6 million peak viewers, more than 100 media people and those taking part, it's also worth mentioning the 250,000 spectators the police estimate to line the towpath in one of London's largest annual public events. In a wider context, 112 countries requested film of the race to screen either live or as highlights for the benefit of a further estimated 200m people around the world. In between Olympic years the Boat Race crews are invited to compete in regattas around the world because of the interest they generate in countries like China, Russia, Spain and the United States. Post-race research shows that more younger people and C1 &amp; C2 demographic profilers watched the race on TV or the website \u2014 which received more than one million hits \u2014 than ever before. The number of articles published on last year's event in national and regional press was more than double those of the year before, providing a media value for the sponsor Xchanging in excess of \u00a31.2m in the UK alone. And as any bookmaker will confirm after the weigh-in, it draws interest and allegiances for Oxford or Cambridge from vast numbers of the public who don't relate to whether they went to the universities or have any connections with them or the sport. The Boat Race is also a great British tradition that deserves respect. Next year will be the 180th anniversary of the first Race \u2014 that's 43 years before the first FA Cup final and more than half a century before English and Australian cricket teams disputed the Ashes. So whether some people like it or not, it's part of our national sporting fabric and heritage. Its values and purpose are timeless and eternally relevant. Its drawing power is proven and consistent. In short, it is something for Britons to be proud of and to demand to watch live on whatever channel."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
