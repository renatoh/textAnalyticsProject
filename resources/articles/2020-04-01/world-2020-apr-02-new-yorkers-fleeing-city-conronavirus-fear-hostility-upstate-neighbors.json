The flood of potentially disease-bearing city folk into countryside communities has even seen threats of violence and pleas from local politicians for them to stay away. In Rensselaer county, a three-hour drive north of New York City, \u201cmany, many, many\u201d people have recently arrived, the county executive, Steve McLaughlin, told the Guardian. \u201cThey\u2019re coming up and they\u2019re occupying hotel rooms, Airbnbs, that type of thing,\u201d McLaughlin said. Rensselaer county had 51 cases as of Tuesday, McLaughlin said, \u201cseven at least that are direct from New York City\u201d. Last week McLaughlin appealed to the New York state governor, Andrew Cuomo, to ban all non-essential travel from New York City to upstate New York. Cuomo said no, but McLaughlin took matters into his own hands by issuing a public health order \u2013 anyone arriving from the city must contact local officials immediately. Those arriving will then be subject to a 14-day quarantine, and will be checked on daily by law enforcement or health professionals. It remains to be seen if this will calm locals\u2019 fears about New Yorkers spreading infection. \u201cYou get a lot of people who are just plain scared who say: \u2018Keep them out, keep them out,\u2019\u201d McLaughlin said. \u201cI take the more middle-of-the-road approach. Nobody has the authority at my level to do in a shelter-in-place kind of order. So, all right, you\u2019re free to travel, just be considerate of your fellow American, your fellow New Yorker.\u201d It has been difficult to quell locals\u2019 anger, however. The Rensselaer county Facebook page is awash with people calling for an all-out ban on people traveling north from New York City. \u201cPut the National Guard right at the damn Hudson River or other points, nobody crosses that line,\u201d wrote one commenter. \u201cThink about our families too, STAY DOWN THERE.\u201d In one of the most extreme examples of resistance, a group of locals in Vinalhaven, Maine, attempted an unauthorized quarantine of some out-of-towners last week. The vigilantes chopped down a tree and laid it across a driveway, in an attempt to barricade the alleged visitors in their home. As it turns out, the people subjected to the locals\u2019 tree felling weren\u2019t even from out of town \u2013 they were a group of three men who had been renting the house since summer while working nearby \u2013 but the New Jersey license plate on their vehicle was enough to trigger the locals. The vigilante behavior triggered condemnation. \u201cThis is not something to be celebrated,\u201d said Genevieve McDonald, a member of the Maine house of representatives. \u201cNow is not the time to develop or encourage an \u2018us vs them\u2019 mentality. Targeting people because of their license plates will not serve any of us well.\u201d To the east of New York City, towns in the Hamptons \u2013 a traditional escape for wealthy city dwellers \u2013 have seen their populations surge. Southampton has seen its population grow in recent weeks from 60,000 to 100,000. In some area of the Hudson Valley and in the Catskills, north of New York City, rental prices have quadrupled as people flee the city. Locals in these communities argue their hostility is not simply parochialism. Many harbor concerns about the ability of rural communities to manage an outbreak, given shortages of medical supplies, stretched hospitals and less access to food and groceries. It isn\u2019t just states to the north of New York that are seeing a surge of outsiders. At the end of March New Jersey\u2019s governor, Phil Murphy, pleaded with people not to travel to homes in the popular Jersey Shore area, after locals complained about the influx of New Yorkers. Some places have taken more drastic measures. In March the island of North Haven, in Maine, banned all visitors, even those who own holiday homes. \u201cThis was never about an us-vs-them-mentality,\u201d Rick Lattimer, North Haven\u2019s town administrator, told Politico. \u201cIt was about the fact that we are nowhere ready to handle an influx of people and their needs.\u201d Despite those pleas, a defensive mentality does seem to have sprung up in many areas, and it is difficult to see when it will recede. \u201cPeople need to stop coming out east. We\u2019re full,\u201d one woman opined on the East Hampton Star Facebook page. \u201cWatching people out there playing tennis in [Amagansett] on my way home from my essential job was infuriating. This is not a frikkin\u2019 vacation. All that talk of the us v them and us playing nice, to score the summer bucks \u2026 pssh.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
