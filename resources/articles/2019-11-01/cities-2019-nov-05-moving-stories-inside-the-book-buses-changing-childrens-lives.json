These travelling libraries stop off at schools in different parts of the city, delivering a wealth of reading material directly to youngsters who have limited access to books. \u201cA lot of schools in our city don\u2019t have access to something as basic as a library,\u201d says Freshta Karim, a 27-year-old Oxford University graduate who was inspired to start Charmaghz, a non-profit, in her home city having grown up without many books herself. \u201cWe were trying to understand what we could do to promote critical thinking in our country.\u201d While for many commuters a bus or train journey presents a rare opportunity to get stuck into a book, in some cities public transport is being commandeered as means of getting books to communities that need them most. Vehicles are being reimagined and upcycled to not only to spread the joy of reading, but to educate and improve lives. One of the library buses created for Kabul schoolchildren by non-profit organisation Charmaghz. Photographs: Mohammad Ismail/Reuters Afghanistan, for example, has one of the world\u2019s lowest literacy rates, with only three in 10 adults able to read, according to Unesco. The majority of public schools in Kabul do not have libraries and the city\u2019s libraries do not offer many children\u2019s books. For Karim, buses were a cost-effective, efficient way to get books to children. Charmarghz rents them from a state-owned bus company. \u201cWe go to nearby schools,\u201d she says. \u201cWe try to stop inside communities rather than on the main streets where explosions often happen.\u201d The organisation is funded by donations from local business and communities, and also boasts a third bus that acts as a mobile cinema. Over 600 children visit the buses each day to read, socialise and play games. \u201cThey are often very excited,\u201d she says. \u201cOne of our biggest challenges is that so many children want to come inside the bus, we can\u2019t have all of them in one day.\u201d A bus converted into a library and classroom by California\u2019s Yes We Can organisation, in Tijuana, Mexico. Photograph: Norbert Tsi/Yes We Can World Foundation On the other side of the world, in Tijuana, Mexico, another bus has been similarly transformed \u2013 this time for migrant children, whose families have come from countries such as Honduras and El Salvador to escape violence or poverty. The city is a popular destination on the migrant trail as it lies south of California where the courts tend to be more welcoming than in places such as Texas, so people have a higher chance of being granted asylum in the US, says Estefania Rebellon, founder of the Yes We Can World Foundation, which runs the bus school. \u201cThe reason we decided to put the first school there is because Tijuana is a go-to migrant destination where the caravan from 2018 landed and where thousands still travel to in the hopes of seeking asylum,\u201d she says. The school chose a location next to a shelter for families, as children make up 60% of the resident population. Many families remain at shelters for months waiting to apply for asylum. The school teaches reading, writing, maths and science; the children also receive emotional support to help them cope with the challenges they face. Photographs: Jorge Due\u00f1es/Reuters/Norbert Tsi/Yes We Can World Foundation Rebellon was inspired to set up the school after volunteering at a Tijuana refugee camp. \u201cI saw kids running around without shoes, just malnourished and not having anything to do,\u201d she says. \u201cWe needed a fast solution to an urgent problem.\u201d The Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies force them to spend long periods in limbo, says Rebellon, who had her own migrant experience as a child when her family fled Colombia for the US. \u201cThey can\u2019t work, they can\u2019t rent a place and the kids can\u2019t be registered in schools because they don\u2019t have a status.\u201d As well as reading and writing (the school is often the children\u2019s first introduction to English) and maths and science, the children receive emotional support to help them cope with the specific challenges they face. \u201cWe try to equip them with as many tools as they need in their situation,\u201d she says. \u201cWe talk about what\u2019s appropriate for kids as far as their own personal space, because unfortunately there\u2019s a lot of sexual abuse towards children on their migrant journeys.\u201d The school also provides children\u2019s storybooks about migration, such as Lola by Junot Diaz, and gives the pupils uniforms and backpacks full of school supplies. There are 45 kids at the school, with a further 30 about to be enrolled, and Yes We Can is fundraising for a second mobile school. Rebellon says: \u201cAs the days go by you see the change in the kids that arrive. They really feel they are in a safe space.\u201d In Tel Aviv, the central bus station in Tel Aviv is home to a Yiddish cultural centre and library. Photograph: Lora Gorodetsky It is not only buses that are being converted into libraries. In Tel Aviv it is the vast and dilapidated central bus station that is the unlikely setting for a Yiddish cultural centre and library containing around 60,000 books. It\u2019s run by Mendy Cahan, an actor and singer whose love for the Yiddish language inspired him to put together the collection, ranging from Yiddish poetry, prose and science books to newspapers. A number of factors have led to the decline of Yiddish over the last century, the most significant being the Holocaust, in which millions of Yiddish-speaking Jews were killed. Yiddish was further marginalised when Hebrew became the official language of Israel. \u201cModern history has been very unkind to Yiddish,\u201d says Cahan, an expert who worked on Son of Saul, the Oscar-winning film set in Auschwitz, translating the dialogue into Yiddish and training the actors to speak it. The library also hosts events, concerts and language classes. Photograph: Lora Gorodetsky He began his collection after struggling to find Yiddish books in bookstores and subsequently set up Yung Yiddish, a not-for-profit to preserve Yiddish culture. The bus station was one of the only affordable spaces large enough to house his books. Cahan believes the location is apt. \u201cWe are a people that travelled a lot,\u201d he says. \u201cFor a cultural centre to be in a place where people move is a good thing.\u201d The library, which also hosts events, concerts and language classes, attracts visitors from a cross-section of communities in Israel. \u201cPeople from traditionally dressed orthodox Hasidim [Hasidic Jews] to youthful anarchistic leftists or LGBTQ people. They like this place, they\u2019re attracted to it in different ways,\u201d he says. With the audible rumbling of buses overhead, Cahan concedes it\u2019s a strange place for a library, but for him the surrounding bustle is a positive. \u201cI feel the urban beat coming through the buses and the travellers. They add a dimension to the experience.\u201d Other book initiatives on public transport \u2022 Comic books were left on trains, buses, trams and underground systems in cities around the UK earlier this month to mark 80 years of Marvel Comics. \u2022 A tram in Bucharest recently hosted an interactive poetry library where passengers were able to read poetry books written by Romanian authors and listen to jazz. \u2022 Carriages on two subway trains in Beijing were turned into audio book libraries where passengers could download books. To give the train the feel of a library, the walls of the carriages were decorated with book covers and made to look like bookshelves. \u2022 People in the Netherlands get to travel on trains for free during the country\u2019s annual book week celebrations. Passengers can present a novel instead of a rail ticket. \u2022 In the Greek city of Thessaloniki, the transport ministry installed mini libraries at bus stops to allow commuters to read as they wait for the bus, or borrow and read on their journey to be returned at a later date. \u2022 Passengers on New York\u2019s subway can download free short stories, poems, essays and book excerpts to their devices during the transport authority\u2019s annual Subway Reads campaign, first launched in 2016.
