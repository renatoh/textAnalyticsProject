The job market has already responded enthusiastically to the number of newcomers who can offer several languages on top of fluent English, and even qualifications from a UK university. The problem is that increasingly employers are looking to workers who come here from other countries to fill the skills gap as many of them have studied a portfolio of languages from an early age, something which has been lost at secondary level here, and which is only just being addressed at primary level. It used to be common for students to take more than one language at both GCSE and A-level - and the scores this year are well above average, which shows that they can be trained to a high standard. It is surely time for young people to be encouraged to include a language in their portfolio, as language skills will undoubtedly be important in their future careers. The ability to work in multilingual teams will also be an asset. Employers should develop proper international communications plans, join skills-for-business networks and offer young people work placements to demonstrate that the value of languages is known and recognised. Their own business will be the better for it. Professor Tim Connell City University, London As GCSE results highlight a further fall in the take-up of modern foreign languages at this level, I support any attempt to reinstate languages as a compulsory subject at GCSE. The decline in foreign languages at GCSE level will have devastating consequences for business competitiveness in the future. It is more than a little arrogant to assume the world speaks English. How can we expect the next generation to compete on the world stage with a workforce that is unable to offer language skills? Lord Dearing recommended that languages become compulsory from the age of seven, and this may well address the trend of falling interest at GCSE level. According to a recent report, young people in their first job lack confidence in answering the phone to a stranger. We need to produce young adults who can answer the phone with confidence to a stranger in another country, and we therefore need to ignite children's interest in languages at an early age. Sam Bufton Marketing manager, language products, Berlitz Publishing Surely an important reason for fewer candidates taking GCSE examinations in foreign languages is that universities no longer demand this qualification to gain entrance to a university. In past years schools would put all pupils through at least one language course because the teachers could not know which pupils would want to try for university entrance. That a person can now obtain a degree without even an elementary knowledge of a foreign language seems to me to be a lowering of standards. Bernard Bligh Hampton Hill, Middlesex While it would be mean to disagree with the proposals to offer apprenticeships to pupils leaving school without a GCSE pass (Report, August 23), I hope that this will not impact disproportionately on pupils with GCSEs also looking for an apprenticeship. The notion that apprenticeships are for lower academic achievers is a dangerous one, a notion which many people would not support and which saw the end of technical colleges and polytechnics as such. Together with the end of most industry-based training-levy schemes it must be a significant factor in the current shortage of skilled tradesmen. The help for these particular pupils is welcome but school leavers in general are also finding apprenticeships in short supply. Mike Brown Newcastle upon Tyne We are doing great harm to many of our 16-year-olds by ignoring their achievements. Those who do not achieve grades in the A* to C range are devalued by society. We do not expect all our teenagers to reach the \"benchmark\" of growing to six feet, so why can't we accept that young people have different abilities and strengths. A Radio 4 presenter on the morning of August 23 went as far as to say that 'five decent GCSE grades are the minimum required to achieve a decent life\". We need and should value everyone who contributes to society; we don't need this display of damaging arrogance. Jan Glynn Bristol It is right to be concerned about the thousands of pupils that leave school each year without a single GCSE at even the lowest grade. The governments's flagship city academies, however, do not seem to be the answer. According to research carried out at Edinburgh University the proportion of such pupils leaving academies in 2006 was higher than for their allegedly failing and low-performing predecessor schools in 2002. This is despite hundreds more exclusions and a large reduction in the numbers of pupils claiming free school meals and those supported by statements of special educational needs. Roger Titcombe Ulverston, Cumbria Yet again I see that the Guardian, along with pretty much every other media organisation, chooses to illustrate the annual exam results story with a photo of pretty young girls effusively congratulating each other. Now I know that pretty young girls look better than spotty teenage boys, but it is a bit tiresome year after year at a time when there are concerns about the academic performance of boys versus girls. Can't your photographers find any photos of boys celebrating their results?
