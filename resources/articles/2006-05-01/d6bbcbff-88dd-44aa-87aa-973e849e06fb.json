I can't bear to part with it, although the oven jets are starting to split and the knobs are becoming brittle. Can I get replacements? New World and British Gas can't help. Most experts we spoke to agree you're dicing with death trying to repair a gas oven this old. However, you are not alone in your search. Try posting your request on the salvage website salvo.co.uk, where many other people are on the hunt for, or offering, replacements for this particular model. Salvo founder Thornton Kay suggests leaving your posting there for six months and being patient. 'You might also contact a friendly retired gas fitter who may have worked with New World Rangettes in the past and know the best sources for parts,' he suggests -though we are at a loss to recommend a retired gas fitters' directory. WANTED: WOODEN BLINDS FOR BAYS Where can I find thick wooden blinds that open in sections for my bay windows - so you can have the blinds open on half the window and closed on the other half? I've seen them in a house nearby, but am too shy to ask where they came from. Interior designer Gill Richardson says, 'These are known as plantation or interior timber shutters and can be found at shutterworld.co.uk (08707 545300) or premiershutters.co.uk (0845 200 2743); also at John Lewis and reputable curtain and blind shops. Because they are custom-made, they are generally more expensive than timber slatted blinds, but they offer increased security, won't tap against the window, and are a striking design feature that will contribute to any \"colonial\" period scheme.' MOVING SHELF SEARCH We would like to find bookshelves on castors to use as room dividers, but that can also be put against the wall (as in last year's article about Lesley Lokko's place in Ghana). Lesley Lokko bought her bookcase from Ikea; however, it no longer makes that model. Habitat sells a similar bookshelf, the Magna Storage High Oak (in natural or grey), with a total of 16 spaces (four across, four down; W: 162cm, H: 173cm, D: 36cm). It has a maximum weight load of 160kg and costs \u00a3365 (0845 601 0740, habitat.net). John Lewis has the Largo tall room divider, available in beech or oak, also with 16 spaces (W: 155cm, H: 155cm, D: 36cm), for \u00a3325 (08456 049049, johnlewis.com). If you're feeling in the mood for DIY, you could try putting castors on a non-wheely bookcase. Bridget Bodoano, author of The Little Book Of Tips And Quick Fixes For The Home Handywoman, has a few suggestions before you attempt the task. 'Books are very heavy, so something tall and thin would be unstable,' she warns. 'Shelves made from insubstantial materials and not solidly constructed are also best avoided.' Bodoano advises you to use shorter bookcases with deep units (at least 38-40cm). And if you opt for longer bookcases, make sure you add extra castors for more support. WHERE CAN I FIND RUBBER FLOORING? Where can I get industrial rubber flooring (the type with raised circles) for my kitchen and bathroom? And can you recommend any firms that would be able to lay it? The posh stuff - the stuff you see in bars, clubs and magazines - is made by Dalsouple (01278 727733, dalsouple.com). The one you're after is called Pastille Alpha, and the average retail price is \u00a341 a square metre. Dalsouple don't lay it, but can put you in touch with supply-and-fit outlets near you. John Lewis, however, offers something called the Noppe Stud Tile, which has the same raised circle design but is laid in 50 x 50cm tiles, rather than one continuous sheet (so you won't get that ocean-of-rubber look). The Noppe retails at \u00a319.96 a square metre and comes in 12 colours, including black, red, orange and beige (08456 049049, johnlewis.com). YOU RESPOND How to handle a gloomy living room next to a sunny kitchen (April 8)? Take the open-plan option. We had the same problem in our bungalow, but they are one L-shaped room now, so when the sun's out it fills both rooms and I never feel cut off in the kitchen. Susie Greenwood Caister-on-Sea, Norfolk Like your cake-baking reader (April 8), I, too, had an ancient Sunbeam mixer. It burned out some years ago, but I still have the beaters, probably as a result of my hoarding instinct. They are free to a good home. John Doran Sketty, Swansea. These beaters have been united with the reader in need. To the reader with the unappealing bath sheets (April 8): the sun is the most powerful bleaching agent you can get. Just look at your curtains after a few years. And the wind is the best drying and deodorising agent; just smell your washing after a few hours outdoors. Simon Barley Wortley, South Yorkshire Further to your article on soundproofing (April 1), sound energy can pass from one room to an adjoining room by two paths. It can travel directly through the intervening wall (direct airborne sound transmission) or via audio-frequency vibration of the solid structure shared by the two rooms, such as outer walls (flanking sound transmission). It is vital to determine which path is dominant before any modifications are made to reduce neighbour noise. Seek advice from an expert; see association-of-noise-consultants.co.uk.
