Things were going reasonably well for Newcastle\u2019s manager in his first Premier League game after succeeding Rafael Ben\u00edtez until he replaced the injured Jonjo Shelvey with Jetro Willems. The Netherlands left-back, acquired on loan from Eintracht Frankfurt, was sent on in a central midfield role but careered around to chaotic effect until Bruce ordered him to swap positions with Matt Ritchie and switch to left wing-back. Unfortunately, Willems was still adjusting to that position when his error contributed to Aubameyang sealing a 1-0 victory for Arsenal. \u201cI put Jetro on in midfield, where he played all last season for Frankfurt, and then very quickly thought, \u2018It\u2019s a bit unfair on him because he\u2019s making his debut so I\u2019ll put him in his favoured position instead\u2019,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cSo I switched him very, very quickly. \u201cWe\u2019ve made a mistake but Jetro wasn\u2019t the only one who made a mistake in the buildup to the goal. Two or three people made that mistake and if you make a mistake in the Premier League you get punished.\u201d The uncertainty surrounding Willem\u2019s role, which at one point had Bruce screaming \u201cwhat\u2019s happening?\u201d from the technical area, may have been resolved quickly but it failed to prevent some Newcastle fans using the unfortunate cameo as a stick with which to beat Bruce. It has left him particularly anxious to secure three points on Saturday at Carrow Road, where he once shone in Norwich\u2019s central defence. Under Ben\u00edtez, Newcastle began last season extremely slowly, taking until November to win their first Premier League fixture at home to Watford but Bruce accepts the fans will not afford him similar patience. \u201cIt would settle everybody down if we could get a nice positive result at Norwich,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I do believe we\u2019ll get better as we go on. The more time I have with the players, the better we\u2019ll be.\u201d It helps that Bruce already understands the volatile nature of life at St James\u2019 Park where he is in charge of a fractured club with many supporters vehemently opposed to Mike Ashley\u2019s ownership and still mourning Ben\u00edtez\u2019s departure. \u201cComing to manage Newcastle was never going to be easy, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d he said. \u201cThe big interest in Newcastle United is what makes it unique. But, hopefully, the fans will come round. I\u2019m from here, so it steels you. When you go to school in the north-east you have to be tough. I\u2019ll have a go, have a crack and won\u2019t be frightened of anything.\u201d Bruce hopes his tenure can perhaps mirror those far distant playing days at Norwich. \u201cI made my debut for them against Liverpool, the team of the 80s,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I scored two own goals in the first 20 minutes but still ended up in Norwich\u2019s hall of fame, included in their best-ever XI. So you don\u2019t always need the best of starts.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
