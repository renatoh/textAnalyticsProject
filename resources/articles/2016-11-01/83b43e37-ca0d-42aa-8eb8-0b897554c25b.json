The US election is over. Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in an event that will reverberate around the world for a long time. Experts in every field in Australia are beginning to offer up their analyses of what this all means for the country; economics, defence, social and political shifts are all being canvassed as the reality of a Trump presidency sinks in. The election dominated the front pages. Some are calling a Trump victory an opportunity for Australia; in a world where we have been dependent on the US-led world order our trade, defence and foreign policies now have a chance to be our own. But the political consequences for Australia should not be underestimated. As the world grapples with populist politics, Australia should consider what this could mean for us. Some were less subtle in their analysis. News organisations also have a lot of reflecting to do, with so many blindsided by the results. Some were happy to acknowledge their errors early on. Not that everyone was terribly impressed with the U-turns. And others see it as critical to shift towards other global alliances. The economic prospects could be dire for the world and Australia. The analysis of how it will affect the environment has been particularly gloomy. Rising inequality is being put forward by some as a key consideration in Australia and around the world. And when all else failed, people laughed. But in a dark kind of way."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
