Practice in the middle is at a premium, with just two matches at Worcester and Hove between now and the first Test. While victory will boost the tourists' spirits, they were not sorely tested except when pulling themselves back from 183 for seven. This was achieved in style yesterday morning by Grant Flower and Heath Streak, who compiled 138 for the eighth wicket. Once Andy Blignaut, more of an all-rounder than his No10 position suggests, had added 34 at a run a ball, Zimbabwe led by 230 on first innings. The only satisfaction for the students was in making Zimbabwe bat again. Cowan, though, will never forget his maiden first-class century. It was almost flawless - there may have been the sharpest of chances to silly mid-off when he was on 28 - and his innings gathered in momentum and confidence. He bats left-handed and though short and slightly built he has power as well as timing. Having past 50 with a slog sweep to the mid-wicket boundary at the expense of the brisk off-spinner Doug Marillier, he launched a big straight six in the same over. Four boundaries came from the next, bowled by Doug Hondo - a clip to square leg, a straight and effortless push, another tap to square leg and a classic cut through backward point, a sequence confirming his ability to attack in all directions. He sent Flower to the mid-wicket boundary for his century, the second half of which came in 42 balls. As partners came and went he powered to 137, leaving Zimbabwe a token 34 to win. The dreadlocked Hondo finished with match figures of seven for 75. Afterwards, the Zimbabwe skipper Streak was pleased with a job efficiently done. \"Obviously for us it was a bit of a work-out as far as different combinations are concerned,\" he said. \"It was good to see Stuart Carlisle and Mark Vermeulen get runs as it'll be crucial in the Tests not to lose early wickets, and Grant Flower has been in good form for some time. When we stuck to our disciplines it paid off - we bowled a bit too short at the start as we're used to an African length. So there's still a bit of work to do.\" \u00b7 Australia moved 3-0 up in the best-of-four Test series against West Indies with a nine-wicket win in Bridgetown yesterday. Jermaine Lawson trapped Justin Langer leg-before off the first ball of Australia's second innings to complete a hat-trick. He also claimed the wickets of Brett Lee and Stuart MacGill at the end of the tourists' first innings. The win enabled Australia to regain top spot in the world Test rankings ahead of South Africa."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
