Will we ever see a team coming up from the second tier to challenge for the title again? No. I'd love to say it could, but I'd be dreaming. The gap now is just ridiculous. In my time with Barry Venison, Peter Beardsley, Rob Lee, Andy Cole, the club could actually go out and buy players to take them to the next level. Keegan came in and because of who he was he attracted players. We got promoted and finished third. That won't happen again. Was it fun playing in that team? I can't tell you how much. It wasn't like a job at all. I couldn't wait to get up in the morning and go to training, there was such a buzz about the place. It was like being a kid at school with no lessons, just playtime. Kevin was new in the job at that time, so in a sense his freshness worked for him, because he wanted to enjoy it, he wanted people to express themselves. Did you ever think it was too much fun? There was one time me, Steve Howey, Darren Peacock and Steve Watson had a little chat and we said, \"You know, we are playing over-attacking football.\" We had a word with Kevin and told him, \"We've got to be a bit safer at the back.\" He said: \"Do you want to play on Saturday?\" We were like: \"I'll do whatever you want Kevin.\" Was he tactically naive? People say he was naive, but he wasn't. It was just that his tactics didn't suit 90% of the teams in the country because they didn't have the players or the foresight to play the way he wanted to. He did nearly win the league ... That's exactly it. Kevin Keegan gets punished for coming so close. I see managers now, people say \"David Moyes, what a job he's done at Everton.\" Yeah, he's been brilliant, but he's not come anywhere near to what Keegan did, competing with Manchester United, overtaking Liverpool and Arsenal. What did you think of Faustino Asprilla when he first turned up? It wasn't just the first day. It was probably every day. To say he was a character is the understatement of the year. His biggest problem was the language barrier. But once he got to learn a little bit of English we got to realise just how dangerous he was [laughs in evil fashion]. He was a Colombian. He enjoyed life to the full. The only bit of criticism was Kevin probably threw him into the team a little bit too quick. We were just starting to learn about how he played and we were going for the title at that point. It must have been quite depressing being taken over by Kenny Dalglish after all that? When Kenny came in I thought he was exactly the right person. I just think he tried to sell too many players rather than adding to the squad. To get rid of Peter Beardsley and Les Ferdinand at that time, particularly Les, was bewildering. Manchester United must have been chuckling, thinking \"What the hell's going on here?\" How do you think Newcastle are going to do this year? Mid-table at best. Maybe a decent cup run. There are some great players there, like Michael Owen and Damien Duff. I just hope they can entertain the crowd and maybe compete with your Tottenhams, Aston Villas and so on. You juggled a football in the centre circle at half time in the 1978 FA Cup final at Wembley. What was that like? I was really nervous. I was only 12 years old at the time. I remember it was just before the World Cup in Argentina and I was pulled in and told to do some ball skills, you know, catch the ball on the back of your neck. Did you catch the ball on the back of your neck? Yeah, I pulled off my trick. That was the main thing. Did you really have to go and see Howard Wilkinson and practice in his back garden? That was the trial. He watched me juggling the ball and gave a nay or a yay. You won two England B caps at left-back in 1994. You might have won more if Stuart Pearce hadn't existed, or Graeme Le Saux. Yeah. Stuart Pearce was a big thorn in my side when it came to getting into the England set-up. At that time we had some really good ones. Le Saux, Tony Dorigo, people like that. Was Pearce the best left-back of your era? By a mile. Pearce would really have an effect on a game from left-back, just by his presence. Who do you rate of the current lot? The top two left-backs are Ashley Cole and Wayne Bridge. Funnily enough Wayne got his chance at Southampton when I was there. He was a left-winger at the time and I got injured and mentioned it to Dave Jones. I said, \"Why not give Wayne a shout?\" And look what he's gone on to achieve. You know, he should owe me a couple of quid, should Wayne. And who did you most hate playing against on the right wing? The hardest, he was so frustrating, was Chris Waddle. You knew what he was going to do, he was going to drop his shoulder, and you could not stop him. Andrei Kanchelskis was pure pace, so you knew you were always in for a tough time. Funnily enough, David Beckham was one of the easiest to play against because you always thought you weren't doing a lot, but he still always put in a great ball. You can't get close to him because he literally bends the ball right past you. Those three stand out. How would you have dealt with Cristiano Ronaldo? I'd have just gone as tight as I could and said, \"Right, today sir you're going to have to run and run to find that ball.\" I'd have niggled, I'd have been treading on his toes. I'd have mentioned everything in the papers. You try everything because the lad's a genius. If he gets the ball at his feet and runs at you, you're in trouble. What was Alan Shearer like to play with? Everybody says he's really funny but he seems quite dull on the telly. Quite often he seems to be reining himself back in. I think it would be great to see his true side come out. He's a massive practical joker with a great sense of humour. You don't really get that on Match of the Day. I know. It's a strange. Sometimes I feel he's doing it that straight he's being sarcastic with it. Maybe it'll all come out later. Yeah, he'll probably walk on with clown feet and a red nose. What's the best film you've seen in the last month? Do you know, I saw Pulp Fiction again about a week ago. It's still a classic, the dialogue in it and everything else. I can remember when it came out going to see Reservoir Dogs on my own in the cinema. I didn't know what it was, just walked in and came out astounded by it. What do you think will eventually replace petrol in our cars? Are bio-fuels the answer? There'll be something nobody's even thought of now. You know, all these UFOs have been spotted, somebody's going to land and they'll show us something we've not seen before that we're a million years from. What do you think of David Miliband? All of a sudden he's come on to the scene. I think Labour have thought \"We're in the shit, we need a new look - right, you'll do.\" It's all manufactured. Great marketing plan. Do you think party politics is dead? Yeah. When I think about it, I think it is. Is it just a consumer choice between Panadol and Anadin? Yeah. Same thing in a different box. Do you believe the children are our future? Yeah. Of course. But why are they always hanging around in bus shelters drinking cider? Because their parents are not teaching them where to go and what to do. Simple as that. John, thanks.
