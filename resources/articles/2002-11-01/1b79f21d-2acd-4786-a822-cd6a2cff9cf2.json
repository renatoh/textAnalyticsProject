The late-night calls are understood to be in retaliation for recent disputes between Birmingham City and Wales. The latest was Robbie Savage's non-appearance for Wales last week. The midfielder missed the game with a groin injury but played in Birmingham's Premiership game at Sunderland three days later. Newcastle United's manager Sir Bobby Robson has also been a victim of abusive calls following his refusal to allow Craig Bellamy to play for Wales. \"For people to make threats against Sir Bobby Robson beggars belief,\" said David Gold, the Birmingham City chairman. \"He is an absolute gentleman and he doesn't deserve that. No one does and I will be asking Steve what course of action he wants to take.\" Savage also had his mobile number published on the internet but did not receive any calls because the information was incorrect. But he fears the calls to Bruce may have repercussions on his chances of playing for Wales again. \"If Steve Bruce keeps getting phone calls, the club might take stronger action and say that, if it keeps going on, they've got every right not to release me,\" he said. \"To put both our telephone numbers on the internet is childish. At the end of the day we're human beings and people have got to look at themselves. It's not Steve Bruce's fault, it's not my fault, it's nobody's fault.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
