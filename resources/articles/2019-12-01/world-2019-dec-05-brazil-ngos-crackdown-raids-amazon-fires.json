But it has hit a menacing new level after last week\u2019s police raid on an Amazonian NGO and the arrest of four volunteer firefighters who are accused of setting alight the forest they risked their lives to protect. Even by the standards of the past 11 months, the detentions in Alter do Ch\u00e3o, and the confiscation of equipment at the headquarters of Sa\u00fade e Alegria, or the Health and Happiness Project, in Santar\u00e9m have proved shocking for those involved \u2013 and those who fear they may be next. Until recently, Brazilian NGOs\u2019 greatest fear was being publicly smeared by a president who has baselessly accused Greenpeace of creating oil slicks, environmentalists of starting forest fires and Leonardo DiCaprio of bankrolling the arson. Now activists worry the powers of the state are being used to criminalise their activities. \u201cThe executive has been investing in new tactics of repression,\u201d Camila Marques from the free-speech watchdog Article 19 said during a webinar of NGOs this week. \u201cWe have never seen intelligence agencies, police and services so active in monitoring and surveillance of social movements. We are facing a scenario of arbitrary imprisonments.\u201d The case in Santar\u00e9m is seen as a bellwether. Shortly after dawn last Wednesday, half a dozen federal police armed with semi-automatic weapons showed a warrant and demanded entry to the premises of Health and Happiness Project \u2013 a long-established NGO that has worked with Prince Charles, Caritas, Coca-Cola and many other international partners. Staff turned up for work expecting to organise medical assistance, sanitation or solar power for remote forest communities \u2013 but instead found state agents examining documents and hauling off computers and files. \u201cI was afraid at first, then angry,\u201d said Jarine Reis, who is responsible for projects related to gender, tourism and traditional art. \u201cI could taste the wrongness in my mouth.\u201d Members of the group felt the raid was politically motivated \u2013 and part of a broader assault on civil society by the government of Bolsonaro. \u201cIt\u2019s completely unacceptable in a democracy. This show of force is disproportionate. We feel violated and disrespected,\u201d said Paulo Lima, a senior coordinator. \u201cUnfortunately, though, at this moment in Brazil, political polarization is leading to a criminalisation of civil society.\u201d The mood of disbelief and fear grew stronger as news came in that one of Health and Happiness\u2019s chief logistical officers, Gustavo Fernandes, had been arrested, along with three other men. The four had set up their own volunteer fire brigade to help the authorities tackle forest blazes in Alter de Ch\u00e3o, one of Brazil\u2019s beloved resort towns and a mecca for artists and nature lovers. The riverside community is also a heartland of the environmental movement in Brazil. The four men were initially denied bail and their heads were shaved. Families and friends believe they were targeted to reinforce Bolsonaro\u2019s claim in August that environmental activists were responsible for the worst Amazonian fires in a decade \u2013 rather than his own government, which has weakened forest protections and encouraged loggers, miners and land grabbers. Bolsonaro and the environment minister, Eduardo Salles, praised the detentions. Civil police said the suspects were under investigation for arson. Local media alleged \u2013 without proof \u2013 that they started a huge fire in September so they could take photographs for fundraising from the WWF and others. But the fragility of the case was quickly apparent. Federal prosecutors challenged the validity of the investigation, saying they looked into the allegations in September and found nothing to suggest any causal link between the fires and the volunteer brigade. In a public statement, they said the evidence pointed instead to land grabbers and property speculators, who use fire to clear forest and drive up its commercial value. The case was further weakened when the suspects provided alibis that showed they were far from the fires when they started \u2013 in one case, on a plane. As doubt grew, the governor of Par\u00e1 replaced the chief investigator and a judge ruled the men should be released until their court hearing. Friends of the arrested men say all four left jobs in S\u00e3o Paulo so they could live closer to nature in Alter do Ch\u00e3o and work with tourism, permaculture and forest protection. They said the founder, Daniel Gutierrez \u2013 a 36-year-old photographer and tourist operator \u2013 worked with the authorities, received training from the state fire brigade, and went out of his way to be politically neutral. \u201cEverybody is in shock. Nobody can believe it,\u201d said Priscila Cotta, who has known the men for several years. \u201cWhy would those who fight fires start fires? Everyone knows they devote themselves to the forest.\u201d Others, who are reluctant to give their names due to fears of retribution, believe the raid and arrests may be linked to land speculation. Gutierrez was planning to start an organisation that would create a deforestation firewall that would prevent a sprawl of tourist resorts along the bank of the Tapaj\u00f3s River. Members of Health and Happiness \u2013 which has no formal links with the volunteer brigade \u2013 have not been charged with any crime, but the police confiscation of computers and files has paralysed the group\u2019s operations, including a hospital boat that was due to carry 40 doctors and nurses and 14 tonnes of medicine and equipment to a remote community on the Arapiuns River. Other NGOs warn this could be just the start of a crackdown. With the government planning to tighten restrictions on public protests and relax regulations on the police, the space for civil society looks set to shrink. The Brazilian Association of Non-Governmental Organizations said the government was pursuing a strategy to delegitimize civil society. Amnesty International\u2019s executive director in Brazil, Jurema Werneck, said Bolsonaro\u2019s tactics echoed similar moves in Russia, India and Hungary. \u201cThe rhetoric of the president and other government officials creates an environment of extreme vulnerability for NGOs, activists and human rights defenders,\u201d she said. Those already in the midst of this assault say they have been living a nightmare. \u201cEach day seems 100 hours long, we never have time for anything, and we feel that someone has declared war on us,\u201d said Caetano Scannavino, a co-founder of the Health and Happiness Project. But he retained faith in Brazil\u2019s institutions to right a wrong, and expressed gratitude for the many people who have given support. \u201cWe have received huge solidarity from all sides. They can take our documents, but they cannot take our joy.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
