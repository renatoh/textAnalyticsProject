Next year, the world\u2019s top surfers will abandon the coast for the dusty town of Lemoore, almost 200 miles (300km) from the ocean, where the brainchild of 11-time world champion Kelly Slater lies at a place called Surf Ranch. \u201cThis is the first repeatable man-made wave that convincingly delivers the power and shape of ocean waves,\u201d said the World Surf League (WSL) when it bought the Kelly Slater Wave Company (KSWC) last year. It was the product of more than 10 years of secretive research by fluid mechanics specialist Adam Fincham, and Slater. The pair had revealed their invention only a year earlier, with video showing Slater riding a smooth, brown wave, about head-high and exceptionally fast. At one point the wave folded over him and he rode inside the tube for several seconds before launching a 360-degree aerial spin and landing with his arms raised. It was a historic moment, taking surfing into fresh, uncharted waters as part of a much-anticipated shake-up of the world tour schedule. Suddenly a fake wave looked as good as a real one. And by buying the majority share in Kelly Slater\u2019s perfect wave machine, the WSL signalled its clear intent that wave pool events would be part of the pro tour\u2019s future. Surf Ranch is a man-made lake 700 metres long and 150 metres wide in central California. A heavy metal train runs its length along what looks like a seaside pier, pushing water forward with a specially designed hydrofoil blade. When a surfer next to the pier catches the forward-moving water and rides it, they are surfing, as if they were on a real ocean swell. The mechanics of surfing But many surfers are uneasy about wave pools going mainstream and the idea of a new generation of surfers with no understanding of the sea. \u201cSurfing is about the randomness of the ocean: chance, luck, wave knowledge, ocean knowledge,\u201d says Ben Marcus, former editor of Surfer magazine and author of Surfing USA! and The Surfing Handbook among others. \u201cIt\u2019s not all just mechanics.\u201d This is the classic objection to wave pools, shared by almost everyone who has paid in frustration and the beatings that Mother Nature demands along surfing\u2019s learning curve. Until now, all surfers have had to do battle with natural forces to find the thrill of the ride. In this sense, the argument goes, wave pools seem shallow and soulless. It perhaps doesn\u2019t help that the wave pool event and a return of a venue in Bali on the world tour schedule forced out two popular events: Trestles in California, and Cloudbreak in Fiji. The Fiji event \u2013 suspended due to a lack of political support, according to WSL \u2013 happens on an open-ocean reef and contestants take boats to the site from two tiny island resorts several miles away. It is a spectacular location for the best surfers in the world to show their talent in swells of consequence \u2013 swells that have travelled thousands of miles from storms in the Southern Ocean before breaking with frightening power on the shallow Cloudbreak reef. Adding the artificial wave to the tour so soon is a bold move by the new British CEO of the WSL, Sophie Goldschmidt. Fresh in the job but highly experienced in mainstream sports promotion, her role is to take surfing to the masses and artificial waves might be the key. \u201cThis technology, and its ability to deliver high-quality waves at any location in the world opens so many possibilities for how we can complement and evolve the competitive experience,\u201d says Goldschmidt. She stresses that the 2018 event will itself be a test, but leaves no doubt that WSL is committed to building a network of similar facilities across the world. \u201cWe\u2019ve already targeted six developments that have begun, or will shortly be underway,\u201d she told journalists recently. The WSL is not alone in its push to take surfing inland. Artificial wave parks using the Basque-made Wave Garden technology, different to the KSWC hyrdofoil, are already open in San Sebastian, Austin, Texas and Surf Snowdonia in Wales. Next week ground will be broken on The Wave in Bristol, in the UK, soon to be followed by The Wave in London. Perth, Melbourne, Barcelona, Dusseldorf \u2013 almost every week, planning permission is granted for a wave pool somewhere in the world. \u201cMore pools means more inclusion,\u201d says Matt Knight of the governing body Surfing England. \u201cOne of the big opportunities is the possibility that we could introduce the joy of wave riding to a more diverse group,\u201c he says. \u201cYes, new technology starts expensive. But if this goes mainstream then the price drops, maybe in 20 years a schoolchild from a landlocked inner-city estate \u2013 who might actually be as naturally talented as Stephanie Gilmore or Kelly Slater \u2013 will have their life changed because surfing is on the curriculum and their teacher could book the local wave pool once a week.\u201d Another common concern the WSL will have to address is will its events become boring? \u201cA contest at the wave machine \u2013 if it\u2019s the same wave every time \u2013 will be like floor exercises in Olympic gymnastics: interesting, but repetitious and missing the point in some ways,\u201d says Marcus. \u2018A poor second to trekking over the sand dunes\u2019 But wave-makers dismiss the issue. Randomness, they say, can be increasingly effectively programmed into these highly computerised wave systems, as can swell height and the shape of the underwater floor which affects where and how powerfully the wave breaks. But equally it is this degree of control that makes many surfers uneasy. \u201cWave pools will always be a poor second to trekking over the sand dunes, finding that empty bank at the right tide, with just the right winds,\u201d says Andy Cummins of campaign group Surfers Against Sewage. \u201cThose are the sessions we live for.\u201d There are environmental concerns, too. Both Surf Ranch and The Wave are 100% powered by renewable energy, but Matt McClain, a former CEO of Surfrider Foundation USA, is worried the arrival of perfect artificial waves might put ocean surf spots in danger. His best example is Trestles in California, one of the contests sidelined by the WSL for 2018. \u201cBy opting to drop Trestles in favour of an artificial wave, the WSL has devalued the surfing resources [there] which, given the ongoing 20-year battle to protect the break from a proposed toll road project, has larger implications,\u201d he says. McClain fears artificial waves will be used by coastal developers as leverage to mitigate damage to natural shorelines. \u201cWhat if a developer decides to extend the breakwater at Oceanside, damaging the surf break. In exchange, they then offer to build a wave park somewhere off Route 76. Is that OK?\u201d Despite the concerns and objections, artificial waves have arrived. We know this because serious surfers have have long treated them with disdain. \u201cWave pools have been around for a long time, but they\u2019ve been shitty,\u201d Randy Rarick, veteran contest organiser and a founding father of professional surfing told Surfline.com after trying the wave at Lemoore\u2019s Future Classic event in September. \u201cI didn\u2019t see a single person walk out of there shaking their head. Nobody went: \u2018Nah this is bogus; this will never replace an ocean wave.\u2019 I didn\u2019t hear a single negative thing from anyone.\u201d So with the best surfers in the world \u201cfrothing\u201d over fakery \u2013 the WSL insists the athletes had a big voice in the decision to add Surf Ranch to the tour \u2013 the first phase of mainstreaming has begun. How far surfing will penetrate inland is the great unknown, but for now, momentum is with the WSL\u2019s high-profile strategy. \u201cThe first event will definitely attract a lot of eyeballs, because the wave is just so mesmerising,\u201d says Marcus. \u201cIt will be up to the surfers to make it interesting and hold the fascination of people who surf, and people who don\u2019t.\u201d This article was corrected on 2 December 2017.
