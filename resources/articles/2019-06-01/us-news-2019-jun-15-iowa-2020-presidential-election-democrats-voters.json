Nor did her mood lighten as she listened to the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren give her answer. \u201cElectability is everything for me,\u201d Franck told the presidential contender, who was giving a town hall at a former post office in Perry, Iowa. \u201cSo if you are the Democratic nominee and you\u2019re in a national televised debate with Donald Trump, what is your strategy for pulling your own?\u201d Warren, who was derided as \u201cPocahontas\u201d by the president because of her claim of Native American ancestry, offered a throwaway comment about having been a state champion debater in her younger days. Then she grew earnest, said she knows how to fight and win, and told an anecdote about taking on banks after the financial crisis. But Franck wasn\u2019t impressed. \u201cI don\u2019t think she answered my question, but that\u2019s standard,\u201d she said. \u201cI think she\u2019s a very smart woman. A very personable woman. I think nine out of 10 times she would do very well. But this isn\u2019t going to be a battle for policies because Trump doesn\u2019t have any. This is going to be a personality war. When Trump comes out swinging, it\u2019ll be \u2018Pocahontas\u2019.\u201d Franck, a 71-year-old retired marketing consultant, said for that reason she\u2019s probably looking for a different candidate to back. \u201cI\u2019m wondering if it can be a woman or if she comes out in his face if that\u2019s going to be perceived as snarky and bitchy and all that stuff that a man can get away with and a woman can\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need not only Democrats to elect our next president. We need a fair number of independents.\u201d It\u2019s a consideration being weighed in differing ways by Iowa\u2019s voters as they enjoy a privileged first say in choosing the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate at the caucuses in February. Gone are the certainties of 2016, when Hillary Clinton was expected to trounce Trump until the exit polls came in. As more than two dozen Democratic candidates crisscross the Iowa landscape \u2013 running a gamut of choices from centrist senators to socialist firebrands, and from tech moguls to gay veterans \u2013 Iowa voters are finding the electoral landscape to be a maze. On the one hand, the politics and culture of 2020 have shifted in four years. The backlash against Trump helped deliver younger, more radical and less compliant Democrats into Congress at the 2018 midterms. The election of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar, and their willingness to openly challenge the Democratic establishment, has offered a sense of reinvigoration and change. On the other hand, there is fear. Democratic voters are seared by 2016. Many do not doubt that Trump could win again, and it is pulling some of them toward candidates who may not change the world but who will not alienate those swing voters who went from Barack Obama to Trump. \u2018Iowa will wean this field down\u2019 Randy Belcher, a creative director in advertising, is newly arrived in Iowa from Detroit and taking his new voting responsibilities seriously. He has been to a bunch of rallies and had come to see former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper, who is speaking about bringing people together while sidestepping policy details in front of crates of IPA at a brewpub in Des Moines. \u201cThe best types of these rallies is when you have them in a bar,\u201d said Belcher. \u201cThis is such a rare opportunity to see the candidates up close. I love the fact that Iowa will wean this field down. We will decide the four or five people who will have a chance of becoming president.\u201d Belcher worried it may be easier for Trump to slip back into the White House in 2020 than some Democrats realize. \u201cThe economy is pretty good. A lot of people who Trump isn\u2019t affecting in their daily lives, they can block out the craziness and the drama,\u201d he said. \u201cI worry a lot that the Democrats are going to nominate someone that\u2019s just not electable. The last place I would want to be would be is at a Bernie Sanders rally. I admire him tremendously. I don\u2019t think he could ever get elected in this country. His ideas are too adventurous for Americans at the moment. Trump is so toxic I want the Democrats to nominate a pragmatic person. I don\u2019t want to say play it safe. That sounds so vanilla. But at this stage, job one is we\u2019ve got to get rid of Trump.\u201d Some of the voters at a Sanders rally a day earlier in Council Bluffs think voters like Belcher have it all wrong. Patrick Hickey, a 48-year-old graphic designer, thinks the lesson of 2016 is that the Democrats need more radical policies and a candidate with credibility in order to motivate people to vote. \u201cIf nothing else, the 2016 election showed we can\u2019t let it be close. A lot of people thought it doesn\u2019t matter, it doesn\u2019t affect me, there\u2019s nothing I can do. We need people to stop thinking that way and to realize there is something they can do. To get out and be vocal, be active and stop sitting down,\u201d said Hickey as Everybody Wants to Rule the World spilled out of the speakers before Sanders spoke. The way to get them to do that, he said, is to have policies that motivate voters. Still, Hickey\u2019s own position is complicated by the fact that he was so angry at what he saw as the Democratic establishment\u2019s stitch-up of the 2016 primaries in favor of Clinton that he voted for the Green candidate, Jill Stein. \u201cI don\u2019t regret my vote. I would vote that way again,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople have to vote for the person who you think can do the best job, not the candidate who can win.\u201d Kelsie Nieto, a 29 year-old nurse, was also irritated at the Democratic National Committee. She said she did not trust Clinton and so didn\u2019t vote for her. Speaking at the Sanders rally, she said she now regrets that. \u201cI will vote for whoever the candidate is this time. We\u2019ve got to get some Democrat blood in that system,\u201d she said. The Sanders crowd is a mix of the ageing and millennials who generally do not seem deterred by the fact he is the oldest candidate in the race at 77. Nieto said she is focused on policies, not age. So is her husband, Dan, who said he is leaning toward Warren, 69. Sanders relates his experience to the crowd by declaring that Iowa was where \u201cthe political revolution began\u201d four years ago. \u201cNobody took our campaign very seriously. It began at 3% in the polls,\u201d he said. The ideas that seemed so radical to much of America back then have gone mainstream with Medicare for All to the fore in the political debate. For that reason, Sanders stands out to Nieto as the most authentic. On the other side of the hall, Samantha Anzures has brought her friend, Kyrsten Correll, to see Sanders. They are both 19 and students. Anzures is a big Sanders fan. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with anything Donald Trump has to say. He\u2019s evil to me. I want to see what we can do to fight against evil. I want the good to win,\u201d she said. But Correll is \u201calong for the ride\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m not very into politics. I\u2019m here to educate myself,\u201d she said. \u201cMy family talks about Trump a lot just \u2019cause my dad was in the military. I\u2019m forced to listen to that so I do want to hear what the opposite end of the spectrum has to say about things because all I hear are Republican opinions.\u201d Kelly Osborne is a Sanders fan to be found at a rally by the California senator Kamala Harris, at the University of Iowa in Iowa City. \u201cI actually don\u2019t know much about her,\u201d she said. Osborne works at McDonald\u2019s while raising her grandson, whose parents are in prison. She earns $8.25 an hour, just a dollar above minimum wage. \u201cI try to make that work but some days I don\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cI want a candidate that\u2019s truly for the people, not for their pocket. Healthcare. Raising minimum wage so we can actually make it in the world. I think Bernie Sanders does fit that bill. I think he will fight for the people and not for his pocketbook.\u201d A few minutes later Harris appeared centre stage, pulsating energy. She told the crowd she was going to spell out some truths. Her first target was Trump, who she accused of \u201cfueling hate\u201d with racism, sexism and transphobia. Then Harris got to what Osborne wanted to hear. How the American economy isn\u2019t working for working people. The lack of affordable housing and healthcare. \u201cClimate change is real\u201d and an existential threat, she declared. It\u2019s a performance that suggests Harris could more than hold her own in a debate with Trump. But one of Harris\u2019 solutions \u2013 a big middle-class tax cut \u2013 sounded Trumpian to some people at the rally. Afterwards, in a testament to the power of personal appearances to sway votes, Osborne said she liked what she saw. \u201cI was impressed with her. She seems like she\u2019s telling the truth. She doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s bullshitting,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a Kamala supporter now.\u201d Some themes are constant, none more so than healthcare. Even where the candidates are not focused on it, many Iowa voters are. Michael Voss was at a Pete Buttigieg rally in Fort Dodge. He attended because as a gay man he wanted to support Buttigieg as an LGBTQ candidate. But Voss is grappling with medical issues which take a good chunk of his income and so he also wanted to hear what the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, had to say about affordable healthcare. In his speech, Buttigieg pushed Medicare for All. But in the Q&amp;A afterwards he rejected European-style publicly run healthcare and said there should be an incremental approach to enticing people away from private insurance. Voss would like to see a public health system but accepted it\u2019s unlikely to happen soon. \u201cPrivate companies are pulling in billions a year. It\u2019s going to be hard to say, you\u2019re not going to get your money any more private companies,\u201d he said. Voss wondered whether Buttigieg\u2019s sexuality would count against him with enough American voters to make a difference at the general election. \u201cWhere he\u2019s from, people are very similar to here in Iowa. They\u2019re very conservative. That\u2019s where Mike Pence came from. But he got re-elected after he came out of the closet. So that\u2019s a good sign. I think that at a certain point people can look past a person\u2019s sexuality. But this part of the state, I\u2019m not so sure. This part of Iowa\u2019s very conservative,\u201d he said. As it is, Buttigieg is riding a wave of popularity in the state. His surge supplanted Beto O\u2019Rourke, who arrived in Iowa with the wind of media interest behind him following his impressive run against the Texas senator Ted Cruz. But O\u2019Rourke lost momentum in Iowa, as some voters wondered what he stood for. \u201cI enjoy his energy but I\u2019m hoping Biden runs,\u201d said Jim Johnson after listening to O\u2019Rourke speak in a cafe in Muscatine. \u201cWe really need someone who\u2019s thought this through.\u201d A couple of weeks later, Joe Biden waded into the race and changed the dynamic by moving to the front, albeit many months before anyone gets to vote. Marc Daniels, a sales rep to retail stores in US military bases in Europe, is Jewish and holding a \u201cMake America Kosher Again\u201d sign while waiting for the former vice-president at a packed bar in Iowa City. He has also brought kippah head coverings embroidered with Biden 2020. He did something similar for Sanders and Warren. \u201cNothing gets a candidate\u2019s attention like a personalized kippah,\u201d he said. Daniels blamed Trump for a rise in antisemitic violence in the US. \u201cTrump\u2019s policies are bringing out the darker angels in a lot of Americans who would otherwise keep quiet,\u201d he said before Biden came on stage. Of the candidates he has seen, Daniels described Warren as \u201cbook smart but cannot connect nearly as well as Bernie or Joe\u201d. He thinks Biden\u2019s probably the best candidate to beat Trump because he appeals to the middle-class voters who switched from Obama in 2016. \u201cI observed the way Joe connected with people along the rope line. He gave them the feeling that he genuinely cares about listening to them,\u201d he said. \u201cJoe was genuinely touched that I had produced the kippahs for him and he really liked the \u2018Make America Kosher Again\u2019 sign. He even signed one for me.\u201d Kaelee Keesee and Zoe Hueser, both 20-year-old pre-law students, are also checking out Biden. They agree they can support \u201canything that\u2019s not Trump\u201d. But on the question of whether Trump\u2019s opponent should be picked on policies or as the best candidate to beat him, Huesser is undecided. \u201cI\u2019ve actually struggled with that one. I think in a lot of ways I find myself questioning who could go against Trump especially when you see how the last election evolved. But I would still like it to be about the policies,\u201d she said. Neither has Biden as their favorite. Kessee is leaning toward Buttigieg. \u201cHe\u2019s my top candidate. He has a great balance because he was a war vet and that appeals to a lot of people. And also he has the great liberal policy plans. I think he would have a great chance of winning,\u201d she said. Huesser is not sure who she would support. Like many Iowans, she is still figuring it out. \u201cWe should have younger people in office right now. That\u2019s the way we\u2019re going to get change to happen. But if Biden were the one who got nominated, I\u2019d vote for him,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
