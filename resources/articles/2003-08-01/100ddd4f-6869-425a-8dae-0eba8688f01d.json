As the eight runners settle into their blocks it is as if the world has stopped for a few moments and is holding its breath. The crowd fall deathly quiet until the gun goes and then they let out a primeval scream. What follows is generally the most talked about 10 seconds of the championships. On Monday August 25 that sense of anticipation will be keener than ever in the moments leading up to the final at the world championships in the Stade de France, due to blast off at 22.10 local time. The race is simply too open to call. Will Tim Montgomery, who set a world record of 9.78sec the last time he raced in Paris last September, be the man? Perhaps it will be Britain's Dwain Chambers, following in the footsteps of the 1993 champion Linford Christie. Maybe a dark horse, such as America's Bernard Williams or Kim Collins of St Kitts and Nevis, will shock everyone. Or will Maurice Greene, written off as yesterday's man, defy the odds and win a record fourth consecutive title? The 100m at this level has not been so unpredictable since the 1995 world championships in Gothenburg. Then it marked the end of the Christie era and the coronation of Donovan Bailey as the new king, and the Canadian enjoyed a brief but glorious reign at the top. By the 1997 world championships in Athens Bailey was suffering with injuries and Greene's victory surprised few. That led to an unprecedented five years as world No1 when he was all but unbeatable. Yet for various reasons neither Montgomery nor Chambers, who finally got the measure of Greene last season, has pushed on this year. First Montgomery found himself embroiled in a worldwide scandal when he signed up to be coached by Charlie Francis, the man behind the disgraced Ben Johnson. Then his partner, the world's top female sprinter Marion Jones, became pregnant. Tonight's race in the DN Galan meeting in Stockholm will be Montgomery's first since last month when he was beaten by Chambers in Glasgow a few hours after Jones had given birth to their son. Chambers has had three victories in Britain this summer but has not won abroad for nearly a year. The accident-prone Londoner had his season's preparation disrupted by falling downstairs and hurting his ankle. With Montgomery and Chambers inconsistent, Greene has missed an opportunity to re-establish himself. Yesterday his management company announced he was pulling out of the Norwich Union London grand prix at Crystal Palace on Friday, in a race featuring Montgomery and Chambers. This was something of a surprise to the organisers. They had not invited him because they refused to meet a demand from the American for a fee of $75,000 (almost \u00a350,000) to turn up. This is the figure Greene was receiving when he was world record holder and he does not seem to have realised that that is a distinction he can no longer claim. One thing which does seem to have diminished is Greene's physical presence. When he was at his peak there was a swagger and arrogance about him. But when he was seen walking through the cafe of a hotel in Rome recently he seemed smaller and less confident, keeping his head down and avoiding eye contact. A similar thing appears to have happened to Britain's Mark Lewis-Francis. A couple of months ago he was bubbling with self-assurance but three defeats by Chambers seemed to have drained that out of him. Lewis-Francis is still only 20 and may be struggling to cope with the vast amounts of praise lavished on him. It would be no surprise if John Smith, the man who has guided Greene to success, who has long coveted getting his hands on Lewis-Francis, soon begins whispering in his ear about how his present coach, Steve Platt, has taken him as far as he can. It will be interesting to see if the youngster, a home-loving bird whose idea of a major upheaval is moving into his own flat around the corner from his mother in Birmingham, can resist Smith's seductive overtures to join him in California. But, if Lewis-Francis can recapture his early-season form, it is as likely to be him on top of the podium in Paris as anyone else. That is what makes the race so intriguing. Anyone with 10 seconds to spare on the evening of August 25 should get close to a television."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
