First, their manager, Paul Sturrock, resigned amid alarmingly early signs that his team were decrepit. Then their chairman, Jim McLean, also resigned following an incident with a BBC reporter. On Saturday at Easter Road, United discovered that even when referees make errors of judgment, they are fated to be the side that suffers. United, with a paltry seven points from 23 Premier League games, thought their gritty show of defiance against Hibernian was going to earn them a point. By the 97th minute, it certainly seemed that a goalless draw would be the outcome. But Alex Smith, United's manager, reckoned without a reckless impulse that overcame the referee, Alan Freeland. Television footage confirmed that Freeland had not actually witnessed what he imagined he had when he awarded Hibs a last-gasp penalty after Craig Easton's collision with Matthias Jack. Easton's foot scarcely made contact with Jack's ankle at a corner, and was completely accidental, but Jack's reaction as he hobbled away convinced the referee that a penalty should be given. It was the cruellest twist for United when Russell Latapy calmy converted past Alan Combe with only five seconds remaining. This sparked heated protests from United's players and Combe is certain to be in trouble with the SFA following his aggressive behaviour towards a linesman as he sprinted from the field at the final whistle. On a weekend when the schedule was virtually obliterated by snow, the only other SPL encounter was at McDiarmid Park, where St Johnstone and Hearts drew 2-2. Andy Kirk and Gordon Durie scored Hearts' goals on either side of two from the home side - first, spectacularly, from Momo Sylla, then from Paddy Connolly. The Celtic manager Martin O'Neill has said that he wants the Slovakian international Lubomir Moravcik to consider remaining at Parkhead for another season. Moravcik, now 35, had suggested he would retire from football at the end of this season, but O'Neill is keen for him to stay on. \"He's a player of fantastic skills and he deserves to be around for another season,\" the manager said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
