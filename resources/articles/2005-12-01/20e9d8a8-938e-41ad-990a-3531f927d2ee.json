Robert Napier, chief executive of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and a member of the government's senior steering group for the code for sustainable buildings, said he could no longer put his name to the recommendations of the group, to be published as part of the pre-budget report on Monday. At stake are the energy-efficiency credentials of thouands of new homes to be built across the south-east of England, including the Thames Gateway developments and the M11 strip up to Stansted airport. The WWF said it understood that the draft code for sustainable buildings, a requirement for the public sector, will represent a climbdown from existing standards. The draft code will also drop existing public-sector requirements for new homes to be close to public transport and for assessments of the ecological value of a development sites. Mr Napier said: \"We have done our very best to work with Mr Prescott's department, to help them deliver something that would live up to the deputy prime minister's own commitments to sustainable, energy efficient housing. \"It appears that the recommendations and advice of the senior steering group has been ignored and in a final demonstration of disregard, the members of the senior steering group have not even been given the opportunity to comment on the draft to be published on Monday.\" Mr Napier added: \"WWF seeks to work constructively with progressive government agencies, but on this occasion we regret we can no longer sanction what Mr Prescott's department is producing. \"The government must now take the public consultation extremely seriously if it stands any chance of delivering what is so urgently needed.\" The environment secretary, Margaret Beckett, later voiced her regret that Mr Napier had resigned from group. She told a London news conference: \"I am sorry to hear that Robert's resigned, not least because if you want to win a fight, you have to be in there fighting. You don't win by walking out usually in my experience.\" The shadow secretary of state for local government, Caroline Spelman, said: \"Mr Prescott used to be the secretary of state for the environment, but it's clear that he's never been too concerned about protecting our environment. \"His current plans to concrete over vast swathes of the Green Belt demonstrate that. John Prescott is already under fire today for refusing to exempt carbon free renewable energy systems from business rates. Now he is back-peddling on commitments to make his so-called 'sustainable homes' energy efficient. \"Labour's record to date on reducing carbon emissions has not lived up to its rhetoric and I fear this news confirms that their resolve is weakening.\" The housing and planning minister, Yvette Cooper, today confirmed that the government will introduce new environmental safeguards for new homes as part of the government's response to the Barker review on Monday. According to the office of the deputy prime minister, the new code will set star ratings for home buyers on the energy efficiency and environmental sustainability of new homes. The first star rating will be more comprehensive and demanding than current building regulations and the highest star rating will require cutting edge technology to achieve carbon neutral development. This also builds on measures already taken to increase the energy efficiency of new homes by 40%."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
