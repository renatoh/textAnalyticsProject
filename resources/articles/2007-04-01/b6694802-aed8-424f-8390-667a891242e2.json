Whether Major Cadeaux (3.55) gets a mile in the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket remains to be seen but he will be at home over the seven fulongs of the Greenham Stakes. He has been working well with four-year-old Asset, who provided the perfect boost when bolting up at Newmarket on Thursday. Ink has stamp of quality Hannon's filly Indian Ink (3.15) has also done some first-class work and at this stage should be sharper than Mick Channon's Silca Chiave or the Barry Hills-trained Silk Blossom. The Channon team are gradually getting into full swing and Treat will go straight for the 1,000 Guineas with a decent chance. Peter Chapple-Hyam sets a poser by running two in the Greenham. Both Dutch Art and Tariq have been working well but the stable will hardly have been encouraged by the modest efforts turned in by their galloping companions Hamoody and Striving Storm at Newmarket this week. The Craven meeting, though, underlined the good form of the Sir Michael Stoute stable and Maraahel (2.10) is in fine shape for his return to action at Newbury today. Red Gala (4.55) is an unexposed four-year-old with the potential to do well in handicaps, while the newcomer Stand Guard (1.40) is highly regarded. John Gosden's Pipedreamer is also one to keep an eye on in the opening race, in which Black Rock sets a high standard. Others likely to keep the ball rolling for the Stoute stable are Gulf Express (8.45) at Wolverhampton tonight and Mystic Dancer (7.25) at Windsor on Monday. Group Therapy (5.30) should not be missed in the opening race at Nottingham tonight. Jamie Osborne's two-year-old will be a lot sharper for his promising debut run. A couple of unraced juveniles to look out for in the next week or so are Michael Blanshard's Perfect Flight, who is by Hawk Wing, and Richard Fahey's Rose Siog. She was an inexpensive yearling but shows plenty of speed at home. Coeur de Lionne, from the Roger Charlton stable, is expected to make his presence felt off a mark of 75 in handicaps. The three-year-old could be in action at Folkestone (5.30) on Tuesday. The stable's Derby hope, Proponent, reappears in the Blue Riband Trial at Epsom on Wednesday. He is a smart prospect but may find John Gosden's Asperity (2.20) too good. This colt has been working well at Newmarket and Gosden has another string to his bow in Raincoat, who should be a leading player in the Sandown Classic Trial next Saturday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
