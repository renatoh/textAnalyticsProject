David Moyes had been unwilling to match Preston North End's \u00a36m valuation but, after holding talks with Roy Keane at Sunderland and Harry Redknapp, the striker opted for Pompey. The 22-year-old said the comparative weakness of Sunderland's squad was the key factor although Redknapp sensed Keane's desire for a swift decision may also have been instrumental. \"I went through the squads one-on-one and there was no comparison really,\" said Nugent. \"That was really a big factor in my decision. Sunderland are a big club but Portsmouth have got the players in and are ambitious. \"It's been a big decision - I had about two or three weeks thinking about it. As soon as I met Harry I knew where I was going.\" Portsmouth are believed to have offered superior wages on a four-year deal but Redknapp insisted money was not a factor. \"They made him an offer - Roy wanted a decision,\" said the Portsmouth manager. \"I think Roy felt he had waited a while. Maybe he thought David didn't show the commitment to join straight away. There was only me and Roy really prepared to put their heads on the line. Everton, I think, want him but I think they were in the background hoping the price would come down if he didn't move.\" The transfer of Nugent, a lifelong Everton fan, will not only benefit Preston financially but also Bury who are due to earn about \u00a31.2m from a sell-on clause. He was unveiled at Fratton Park yesterday alongside the Nigerian forward John Utaka, who is understood to have signed a four-year contract for a club-record fee of just over \u00a37m. It takes Redknapp's spending this summer beyond \u00a320m following the additions of Sylvain Distin, Sulley Muntari, Hermann Hreidarsson, Martin Cranie and Arnold Mvuemba. Newcastle United and Manchester City registered late interest in Utaka, who has scored 22 goals in 62 appearances at Rennes, including successive hat-tricks last season against Lyon and his former club Lens. \"It's been a long battle,\" said the Portsmouth chief executive, Peter Storrie. \"He's had a lot of pressure from other clubs and Rennes didn't want to sell him.\" Utaka prefers to play as one of two central strikers and says he was influenced in his decision by his international team-mate Nwankwo Kanu as well as the persistence of Redknapp, who highlighted the 25-year-old's pace, power and skill. \"He [Redknapp] showed more interest, he showed that he wanted me to come,\" said Utaka. Kanu's Portsmouth future, however, remains the subject of some doubt. The Nigerian is out of contract but has been offered a new one-year deal at the club with the option of a further year if he makes more than 20 appearances. \"I want him to come back - he has still got a part to play,\" said Redknapp. \"He's worried about 20 games but if you don't play 20 games, you are not worth another year. I'm sure he will take part in 20 games.\" Redknapp is hoping to make one more signing before the start of the new season, with the priority of finding a winger or striker with pace. He is happy, though, to have strengthened his options up front and is adamant Nugent is worth \u00a36m despite being unproven in the Premiership. \"It's supply and demand. People who can put the ball in the back of the net are a rare commodity. There's a shortage of top-class English strikers and he has got every opportunity.\" Nugent, who scored on his England debut against Andorra, has been told by Steve McClaren that he must play regular Premiership football to stand a realistic chance of featuring next year at Euro 2008. \"The Premiership is where I need to be to further my career,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
