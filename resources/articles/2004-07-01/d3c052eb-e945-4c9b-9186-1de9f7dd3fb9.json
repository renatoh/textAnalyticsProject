A car accident is likely to put Mark Butcher out of the Lord's Test and there is the gnawing possibility that Andy Flintoff will need an operation on the ankle injury that will in any case prevent him from bowling. Barely 24 hours before Lord's stages the first of the four Tests, England were resigned to the likelihood that Butcher's whiplash injury, suffered in a car accident near The Oval on Monday afternoon, will not heal in time, so offering Kent's Rob Key another opportunity to state his Test credentials. Flintoff reluctantly had a cortisone injection in his left ankle after an MRI scan in Leeds showed that the inflammation caused by a bony spur had not fully recovered. He will play as a specialist batsman, with England hopeful that he will be fit to bowl in the second Test at Edgbaston. \"Because the spur is relatively small, rest or injection may reduce the inflammation and as a consequence surgery is not inevitable,\" said Dr Peter Gregory, the England and Wales Cricket Board's chief medical officer. \"It is not a case of delaying an operation.\" But there are ample reasons for concern. Earlier in his career Flintoff was pumped with cortisone to ease his back problems and vowed never to see its like again; Gregory admitted that inconclusive research links cortisone injections in the ankle to achilles ruptures; and the spur is likely to grow with age, suggesting that an operation will one day be inevitable. Glenn McGrath's experience suggests Flintoff will be fortunate to avoid an operation. The Australian fast bowler, who has just arrived at Middlesex on a month's contract, warned yesterday: \"It's not the sort of injury that goes away.\" McGrath missed a year's Test cricket with an identical injury and frequently faced speculation that his career was finished as several failed comebacks culminated in a second operation to remove two further ankle spurs. He returned in Darwin this month, took seven cheap Sri Lankan wickets and spoke of a \"prolonged career\". So, barring complications, Flintoff could have an operation at the end of the season, skip the one-day tour of Zimbabwe and still be fit for the first Test against South Africa in mid-December. Flintoff's inability to bowl also risks overload for Steve Harmison. Only Harmison himself seems relaxed about his heavy workload prior to a Test where four or five good wickets would enable him to overhaul Sri Lanka's Muttiah Muralitharan and be ranked as No1 in the world ratings. No England bowler has achieved that since Ian Botham was in his heyday. \"My body fells good,\" Harmison said. \"I feel less tired playing Test cricket than county cricket.\" Butcher faced only a few deliveries in the Lord's indoor school yesterday before abandoning his practice. Bizarrely, he had been driving to The Oval for treatment on the thigh injury that also threatens to break a run of 42 consecutive Tests stretching back to the start of the 2001 series against Australia. He was five minutes from The Oval when he drove his black BMW through a set of traffic lights, stopped to let a car turn right and was rammed from behind. \"I looked in my mirror and saw something coming at me and braced myself for the impact. I was about half an hour getting myself together again. I was a bit dazed but I carried on my journey. A neck injury is one of the worse things that could happen because it affects everything you do. I'm not moving too well. If the Test began today I wouldn't have played.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
