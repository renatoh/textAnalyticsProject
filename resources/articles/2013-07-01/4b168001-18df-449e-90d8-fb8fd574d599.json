However, as Blondie so memorably sang, I'm not the kind of girl who gives up just like that. Twelve formulations later and I'm happy to report that potato flour is the magic ingredient. Team with my dairy-free and egg-free pina colada ice-cream for a handful of summery perfection. Ice-cream cones Makes 6 50g potato flour 30g icing sugar 30g dark muscovado sugar \u00bd tsp sunflower oil \u00bc tsp vanilla extract \u00bc tsp xanthan gum 1 Preheat the oven to 160C/325F/gas mark 3. Use a pencil to draw three 15cm-diameter circles on to baking parchment. Cut them out, but leaving a border of about 3cm from the line. Place the circles on a baking tray. 2 Place the flour, sugars, oil, vanilla and xanthan gum in a bowl. Stir, gradually adding 50ml water to create a smooth mixture. Leave to sit for 10 minutes. 3 Place 1 tbsp mix in the centre of each circle. Use a palette knife to spread the mixture out evenly to the drawn line. Don't make the edges too thin or leave any holes. Bake for 16\u201320 minutes. 4 Now the tricky bit: remove the discs from the oven. Grab the edge of the parchment using a tea towel or oven glove, then roll the circle into a cone. Hold for a few seconds until cool enough to handle; then peel off the paper and form a tighter cone. Pinch the bottom to prevent the ice cream dripping out. 5 Leave the cones seam-side down until hardened and start on the next batch using the same parchment. Pina colada ice-cream Serves 6 2 x 230g tins pineapple chunks in juice 2 x 160ml tins coconut cream 150g icing sugar 1 Blend all the ingredients together in a food processor and pour them into a large plastic tub. 2 Freeze for four hours at least, then quickly whizz in a food processor. Freeze for a further hour before serving in the cones. What to watch out for Xanthan gum may come from a wheat-based source, so if you are sensitive to gluten, check that it is gluten-free. If you don't drink alcohol, use vanilla flavouring instead of extract."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
