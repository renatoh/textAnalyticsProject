Perhaps it's symptomatic of the same market-driven impatience that has stretched the Christmas season into two months, or perhaps it's just that most Americans are particularly anxious to get rid of the current White House occupant. Whatever it is, the zealous attention being held at bay until the midterms were over will be unleashed in all its full-throated madness come the end of the holidays and the beginning of a new year, so, in that spirit, here's your introduction to The Players. The Democrats \u2022 Senator Joe Biden is a six-term Senator from Delaware who sits on the Judiciary and Foreign Relations Committees and has competent fundraising ability. He was a presidential candidate once before, in 1988, though his candidacy was cut short after he was discovered to have plagiarized a speech of British politician Neil Kinnock and, in so doing, presented facts about Kinnock's life as his own life story. He has not registered with the Federal Election Commission but confirmed he will run on Bill Maher's political chat show Real Time and reiterates the same any time a microphone is within ten yards of him. \u2022 General Wes Clark ran for president in 2004 after retiring from the Army, where he had risen to the rank of four-star general as NATO's Supreme Allied Commander in Europe. He was \"drafted\" to be a candidate in 2004 by Democrats looking for an \"outside the Beltway\" candidate with military experience, and the Arkansas son was a Clinton favorite (when there wasn't a Clinton running). Lefty moneybags George Soros has given more money to Clark's presumed 2008 campaign than any other candidate, though the General has yet to officially announce his candidacy. \u2022 Senator Hillary Clinton is a two-term Senator from New York and the former First Lady of the US, which would only be news to someone awakening from a 20-year coma on Mars. She has (almost) peerless name recognition and is a fundraising juggernaut, two traits which have conferred upon her the enviable title of Candidate to Beat, though she hasn't even officially announced her candidacy. She is an inveterate triangulator, viewed by (most) conservatives as far too liberal and by (many) liberals as far too centrist, but by any calculation, the American presidency is more closely within her reach than any other woman's to date. \u2022 Senator Christopher Dodd was a two-term member of Congress and is now a five-term Senator from Connecticut. He's a libertarian-leaning liberal who most lefty Nutmeggers appear to consider a solid Senator. Little national name recognition and dubious fundraising potential position Dodd's candidacy, irrespective of his intentions, to be that for a veep slot, rather than the top of the ticket. He is expected to announce his plans next month. \u2022 Former Senator John Edwards was the veep on the Dems' 2004 ticket, distinguishing himself by making poverty the centerpiece of his campaign and conveying his passion for effectively addressing poverty with a compelling storyline about the Two Americas, born of his own history as a millworker's son. Since the '04 loss, Edwards has continued his anti-poverty and workers' rights advocacy, and he continues to be a progressive favorite. He is expected to formally announce his candidacy in New Orleans' Lower Ninth Ward any day now. \u2022 Former VP Al Gore has never made a definitive Sherman Statement, saying instead that he doesn't plan to run but hasn't ruled it out. The site he used for his 2000 presidential bid, (a href=\"http://www.algore.com\"&gt;AlGore.com, recently went live again, although it's been rededicated to what he often describes as the \"different kind of campaign\" to which he's devoted himself - averting a global climate crisis. Gore doesn't have to make any immediate decisions, and probably won't; he could jump into the race any time just as easily as he could now, because his name recognition and fundraising ability rival (if not exceed, post-Inconvenient Truth) Clinton's. \u2022 Senator John Kerry is beginning his seventh term as Massachusetts junior Senator and was the 2004 Democratic nominee for president. Though he had wide netroots support once he had secured the nomination, several missteps during the campaign - particularly a delayed response to the Swift Boaters - and after his loss - including not spending all of his campaign funds and quickly conceding Ohio, and hence the election, to Bush in spite of voting irregularities - make a recapture of that support exceedingly unlikely. He has not formally announced his candidacy. \u2022 Representative Dennis Kucinich, who will begin his sixth term representing Ohio's 10th district in January, was a Democratic candidate in 2004 and therefore has some national name recognition and minimal fundraising power. He is a genuine progressive who, to his credit, has the authentic enthusiasm of a secondary school Student Council President, and, to his misfortune, conveys approximately the same gravitas. His guilelessness has endeared him to many progressives, in spite of having no serious shot at the presidency. He has filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to officially begin his candidacy. \u2022 Senator Barack Obama is a first-term Senator from Illinois and has been considered the foremost rising star of the Democratic Party since his keynote address at the 2004 convention. Considered the biggest threat to Clinton, Obama's meteoric rise and much-discussed charisma have been cited as contributing factors for one-time potential candidates Mark Warner and Evan Bayh dropping out of the race. His biggest presumed liability is his race. He is expected to announce his decision about running in the new year. \u2022 New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson was just reelected to his second term in a sweeping victory and has repeatedly suggested he will run in 2008, though he has made no official announcement. Like Obama, his race is a presumed liability; more pressingly, he has little national recognition. He has said he will make his decision after the first of the year. \u2022 (Soon-to-be-former) Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack is currently serving out his second term in one of the most important primary states. He has low national name recognition and his moderate position on the Iraq War hasn't made him a particular favorite of the netroots to this point. He has filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to officially begin his candidacy. The Republicans \u2022 Senator Sam Brownback, serving his second term on behalf of Kansas, is an extremely socially conservative Republican, opposing abortion even in cases of rape and incest, supporting a federal amendment to ban same-sex marriage, favoring the teaching of intelligent design alongside evolution, and voting to end special funding for minority and women-owned businesses. He is well-positioned to be the preferred candidate of the Religious Right, though his national name recognition is very low. \u2022 Former Virginia Governor Jim Gilmore succeeded recently ousted Senator George Allen as governor of Virginia, a position he held until 2002. He has said he will launch a presidential exploratory committee in January to help him decide whether to run. His platform would look very similar to Brownback's, although he has less national presence - which is to say he has almost zilch. \u2022 Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich says he will only run if the American people call upon him to do so because there is no viable alternative. He was quite prominent in the 1990's, when he authored the Contract with America, helped orchestrate the Republican Revolution of '94, and served as a key player in the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, but he now has a whiff of the hasbeen about him. He has recently been attempting to position himself as a moderate, but is still a wingnut at heart. He will hold off on announcing anything for awhile, to see what how the lay of the GOP primary land shapes up. \u2022 Former NYC Mayor Rudy Giuliani will likely announce his candidacy soon and evidently plans to employ the fine Republican tradition of exploiting 9/11 as the cornerstone of his candidacy. Giuiliani is a bit of a conundrum for the conservative rightwing, as he is the sort of jackbooted thug they really like, but the sort of social moderate they really don't. He is pro-choice and pro-gay rights and will have a messy public affair and divorce while he was \"America's mayor\" to account for during a national campaign. The jury's still out on how Rudy will play in Peoria, although he is reasonably well-known nationally. He will likely announce his candidacy next month. \u2022 Senator Chuck Hagel has represented Nebraska since 1997 and has been a rare GOP critic of the Bush administration's Iraq policy, giving him a nominal reputation as a moderate, though he remains decidedly conservative on social issues. One imagines that he is, like Chris Dodd, auditioning for a veep slot, rather than the top of the ticket, if he runs at all. \u2022 (Soon-to-be former) Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee is just completing his second full term in the southern state, where he could not seek a third term due to term limits. Loudly anti-gay and pro-creationism, Huckabee has been traveling to primary states to shore up his conservative credentials. He achieved some national notoriety with a dramatic weight loss (and the requisite book about it), but he's hardly a household name. He will announce his plans after he finishes he second gubernatorial term in January. \u2022 Representative Duncan Hunter has represented California's 52nd district since 1981 and has essentially no national presence or fundraising ability. He announced his intention to run in October to much yawning indifference, even from his own party. \u2022 Senator John McCain is a veteran and former POW who has represented Arizona in the Senate since 1987 and served in the House from 1981-87. He was defeated in the 2000 primary by George W. Bush, who went on to win the presidency. McCain spent most of his political career building a reputation as a \"maverick,\" which he is now busily trying to dismantle so he can garner enough support from social conservatives to secure the Republican nomination. He is expected \"to formalize his campaign for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination early in February, holding off on a formal announcement while he gets his nationwide campaign ready to roll,\" though he has already set up an exploratory committee and begun hiring key campaign staff. He is well-known nationally and has significant fundraising ability. \u2022 (Soon-to-be former) New York Governor George Pataki is serving out his third term after not seeking reelection. Known as a liberal Republican primarily for his support of reproductive and LGBT rights, he has signaled his interest in seeking the Republican nomination, but is rarely cited as a serious contender. He is as socially liberal but less well-known nationally than Giuliani, making his candidacy a long shot at best, particularly if Giuliani runs. \u2022 (Soon-to-be former) Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney will conclude his single term in January after not seeking reelection. The Mormon son of a former governor of Michigan has been busily trying to bolster his conservative credentials by traveling to particularly conservative states to bemoan the gay, gay state of affairs in his home state, where same-sex couples have been granted equal marriage rights by the courts. He is slated to announce his candidacy and file paperwork with the Federal Election Commission after the new year. \u2022 Representative Tom Tancredo has represented Colorado's 6th district since 1999 and is best known for being a hardcase on illegal immigration. He is basically nuts and has no chance of winning the nomination, and likely wants to run just to make his points about immigration during the primary debates. \u2022 Former Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson, who served as Bush's Secretary of Health and Human Services from February 2001 to January 2005, filed the paperwork to launch an exploratory committee on December 15, but has yet to make any formal announcements regarding his candidacy. He has limited national recognition, dubious fundraising abilities, and provides no significant alternative to many of the other likely GOP candidates. That's the breakdown as we head into the new year. Keep it handy over the next few months as the horseraces heat up.
