Looking ahead to the end of the year, economists at the BCC said GDP growth will fall to 1.1% from a previous forecast of 1.3% while next year it will hit only 1.3%, down from 1.4%. By 2020 the UK economy will have suffered its second weakest decade of average economic growth on record as as business investment and export growth slow, said the BCC. The figures chime with most other mainstream forecasters, though they follow upbeat official figures that showed the economy expanded by 0.6% in just three months to the end of July. The BCC said the high cost of doing business in the UK and ongoing uncertainty over the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU would continue to stifle business investment, and drag down growth in the second half of the year. The jobs market is expected to continue to be a source of strength for the economy, with the unemployment rate predicted to remain close to its 40-year low. But the BCC said businesses will continue to face significant skills gaps, undermining their potential to grow, while workers are unlikely to experience meaningful real wage growth as the gap between pay and price growth is forecast to remain negligible. Adam Marshall, BCC\u2019s director general, said the forecast will put pressure on Philip Hammond to put together a budget that supports struggling businesses. \u201cBrexit uncertainty continues to weigh heavily on many firms, as most of the practical questions facing trading businesses remain unanswered. \u201cAt a time of massive change and uncertainty, business would not forgive a timid \u2018business as usual\u2019 autumn budget,\u201d he said. There is also pressure on the chancellor to set aside funds to reverse planned cuts to public services. Hammond needs to find an extra \u00a320bn for the health service following promises by the prime minister to boost health spending by more than 3% a year. The New Economics Foundation (NEF) said several government departments without any explicit spending protections from ministers \u2013 such as prisons, public health and housing - would be exposed to severe funding shortfalls by 2023\u201324 that could damage their ability to provide decent public services. NEF said Britain\u2019s prisons would face a budget black hole worth \u00a370m per year by the middle of the next decade while funding for public health \u2013 which covers addiction services \u2013 would face cuts worth \u00a380m by the middle of the next decade under the current departmental spending restrictions if left unchanged. Housing and planning \u2013 including schemes to incentivise the building of new homes and homelessness prevention \u2013 would risk cuts worth about \u00a330m per year over the same time period. The findings come ahead of the autumn budget, when the chancellor also plans to unveil the total amount of money available for a comprehensive spending review covering Whitehall departments next year. Although the government has pledged to protect spending on areas such as the NHS, schools, defence and overseas aid, some departments face tighter constraints on spending that can result in cuts over time. NEF\u2019s analysis is based on rolling forward the current spending restrictions imposed by the government until 2023-24, which would be the likely final year of a four-year spending review. It suggests Hammond could meet his current deficit targets even if the government borrows a further \u00a324.1bn per year by 2023-24. Hammond has previously argued there was \u201clight at the end of the tunnel\u201d for the public finances, raising the prospect of greater spending on public services at the autumn budget to bring austerity to an end. While allocating funds at the budget, the government would conduct the spending review next year after Brexit. Alfie Stirling, head of economics at the NEF, said: \u201cThe decade of austerity so far has arguably been the worst policy error in a generation.\u201d \u201cIf the chancellor fails to take the opportunity to learn from the lessons of the past by taking action at the spending review, we could be living with the consequences of deteriorating service quality and lost living standards for years if not decades to come.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
