In speaking to Heather magazine she said she decided, \u201cI can either stay in bed and wilt away or I can sing and write my way through this.\u201d Just a Story is the first track from her forthcoming EP Mirage and it\u2019s a good one, with plenty of oomph in the soulful vocals and a drum beat that clips along at a spritely pace. Cheap Wine \u2013 Cold Chisel Adelaide classic rockers Cold Chisel, fronted by the indomitable Jimmy Barnes, are playing a special one-off intimate show at Canberra on 26 February. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to playing at the Royal Theatre\u201d, said piano player Don Walker, in a release. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking of dedicating the show to Prince Phillip, who really doesn\u2019t get enough recognition.\u201d The band will also headline the rev-fest Clipsal 500 in their hometown on 1 March. To celebrate here\u2019s a revisit of their bittersweet 1980 tribute to dysfunctional bohemian life, Cheap Wine. Peace is My Drug \u2013 Katie Noonan \u201cPeace is my drug; It stops the pain\u201d \u2013 so begins the sparsely written but wonderfully profound poem by cartoonist Michael Leunig. Likewise Katie Noonan\u2019s song, inspired by the poem with Leunig writing a second verse especially for the Brisbane jazz-pop singer, captures the same quiet dignity of the original. Noonan has turned to crowdfunding in order to record her new and sixth studio album, with 5% of money raised going to the mental health charity Beyond Blue \u2013 and is touring the country throughout March. Run \u2013 Seth Sentry Seth Sentry was one of those rare gems uncovered on Triple J\u2019s Unearthed \u2013 and his debut album This Was Tomorrow debuted No 6 on the Aria charts, securing his place as one of Australia\u2019s most popular hip-hop acts. A few years have passed since the Melbourne rapper released new music, with a brand new single called Run pointing at what\u2019s to come. The song turns the clock back to Sentry\u2019s childhood days, spent in a small town and staving off boredom by shoplifting chocolates, dodging the coppers and hanging out in skate parks. Climate Septic \u2013 Until Abbott Gets Gone \u201cWe can\u2019t wait to break up,\u201d says drummer and vocalist Joe Gould. Not a line you usually hear from a band \u2013 at least not until a couple of albums in. But punk rockers Until Abbott Gets Gone exist for one reason only: to protest the failure of Australian prime minister Tony Abbott \u2013 and they\u2019ll be happy to call it quits once he does. Gould, along with fellow band member Gordon Wallace (guitars, vocals), are better known as one half of gypsy folk punk act and festival faves Crooked Fiddle Band, playing Sydney\u2019s Basement on 26 February."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
