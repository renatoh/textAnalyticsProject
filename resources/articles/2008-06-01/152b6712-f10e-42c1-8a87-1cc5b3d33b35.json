One the one hand, each disc does give a sense of the creative trajectory that Crumb's composing career has followed, but on the other it means that the genuinely worthwhile music is sometimes spread preciously thin. Here the best-known work is Crumb's response to the 1969 moon landing, Night of the Four Moons, a typical example of his richly allusive style from that time, with references to Mahler's Das Lied von der Erde and Haydn's Farewell Symphony clothing settings of poems by Lorca. The well-crafted Variazioni from 10 years earlier reveals the Schoenbergian raw material from which Crumb's more personal style would be forged, but Otherworldly Resonances for two amplified pianos from 2005 does nothing that the earlier music did not do more vividly and freshly. The recordings are a mixture of old and new, too, though judiciously so, and in particular it's wonderful to hear again the late Jan De Gaetani's performance of Night of the Four Moons; nobody has sung Crumb's music of that period with more intensity or understanding than she did."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
