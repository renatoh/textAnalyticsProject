After optimism earlier this year that inflation was falling back towards the Bank of England governor's target of 2% after peaking at 5.2% in September 2011, a survey released on Monday shows that he might struggle to reach his goal. The monthly inflation index prepared by the accountants and business advisers BDO dropped by 0.1 points in April, suggesting the welcome downward trend in inflationary expectations over the past nine months is ending. This levelling off sees the index at 102.9, well above the average trend level of 100 (2.7%), suggesting inflation is unlikely to reach the Bank's 2% target by the end of the year. These inflationary pressures, compounded by low growth in regular annual earnings at just 1.6% \u2013 below the inflation rate \u2013 are critically undermining consumer spending power, a key contributor to economic recovery. The official rate of inflation is already rising again \u2013 increasing to 3.5% in March \u2013 and any further increases will undermine government hopes of kickstarting the economy. Adding to consumers' woes, job trends remain weak. While the BDO employment index did improve in April, it barely edged into growth territory at 95.5 \u2013 the boundary is 95 \u2013 and remains well below the long-run trend rate of 100. Unemployment figures due on Wednesday are expected to show a small rise. While there is a more positive view of the economy than six months ago, businesspeople across the UK predict protracted slow growth for the economy for the remainder of 2012. BDO's optimism index \u2013 which predicts business performance two quarters ahead \u2013 fell from 96.7 in March to 96.2 in April. Although the index remains above 95, it moved further away from the crucial 100 mark that equates to average UK trend growth. Peter Hemington, of BDO, said: \"Given the public-sector austerity measures required to reduce deficits, policymakers across the globe have reached for unconventional monetary policy tools to encourage growth. However, the UK has shown stubbornly high inflation and our findings suggest that businesspeople predict inflation will continue above target \u2013 potentially a self-fulfilling prophecy. \"Some economists believe that the Bank of England should convince businesses and consumers that it is prepared to tolerate inflation. The thinking is that only this will convince consumers to spend and businesses to invest, as the alternative is to see the value of their cash assets decline. \"If this is the strategy, then it may be the right one. But it has not been articulated as such and the concern is that every day inflation continues above target, the Bank loses more credibility and has less room for manoeuvre.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
