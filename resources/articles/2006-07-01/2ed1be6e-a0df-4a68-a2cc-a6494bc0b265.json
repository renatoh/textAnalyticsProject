A late try by the home side made for a nailbiting last few minutes but Wigan had done enough to earn their victory. Danny Orr, so often under fire, was magnificent in both attack and defence that earned him the man of the match award. There was little to choose between the teams in a tough opening quarter punctuated by penalties and dropped ball. Solomon Haumonoeventually broke the deadlock taking a pass from Henry Paul to burst through the Wigan defence before forcing his way over the line with three defenders hanging off him. After a long deliberation the video referee awarded the try on the 'benefit of the doubt' ruling that favours the attacking side. Paul kicked the goal but Haumono hobbled off immediately with what looked like a leg injury. The Warriors worked hard to get back into the game and with Quins making far too many mistakes, it was inevitable that the visitors would make them pay. Orr and Fletcher combined to put Chris Ashton over and Michael Dobson levelled the scores with the conversion. They took the lead when Brett Dallas intercepted a pass from Paul on the halfway line and went over unopposed, Dobson making it 12-6. But just before half-time the video referee was called on twice as the home side fought to get back on terms. Thomas Leuluai's effort was denied but he awarded a penalty try when Pat Weisner lost the ball when tackled by Dobson and Harrison Hansen. He ruled that the ball had been stolen in a two-man tackle and Paul converted to make it all square at the interval. Wigan regained the lead two minutes into the second half with a penalty from Dobson, but Harlequins hit back when Gareth Hock lost the ball in a tackle. Leuluai fed Karl Temata who sent Joe Mbu through a huge gap to the tryline. Paul converted but the Warriors struck almost immediately, Orr breaking through before chipping ahead for Mark Calderwood to score, Dobson's conversion making it 20-18. Calderwood broke through some weak defence and Ashton was in support to touchdown and give Dobson a simple conversion. The visitors seemed to be coasting to victory but nine minutes from time Zeb Luisi squeezed a pass out to Mark McLinden who raced behind the posts to give Paul a simple conversion. Hull extended their winning run to 10 with a second successful visit to France. They followed their six-point win in April with a 24-16 victory. They took a quick 12-0 lead, but were trailing 16-14 approaching the hour mark. Shaun Briscoe put them ahead and Sid Domic's try three minutes from time secured the win."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
