The interviewer may be looking for evidence of your job skills outside of your professional experience. For example, hobbies like chess or bridge demonstrate analytical skills. Reading, music and painting are creative hobbies. Individual sports show determination and stamina, while group activities may indicate you are comfortable working as part of a team. The interviewer might simply be curious as to whether you have a life outside of work. Employees who have creative or athletic outlets for their stress are often healthier, happier and more productive."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
