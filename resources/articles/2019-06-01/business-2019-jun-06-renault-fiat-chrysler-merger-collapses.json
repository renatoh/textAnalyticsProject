Fiat Chrysler, an Italian-American company, withdrew from a 50-50 merger proposal with its French rival after a board meeting on Wednesday. A deal would have created the world\u2019s third-largest carmaker behind Volkswagen and Toyota. \u201cFCA [Fiat Chrysler Autmobiles] remains firmly convinced of the compelling, transformational rationale of a proposal,\u201d the company said. \u201cHowever, it has become clear that the political conditions in France do not currently exist for such a combination to proceed successfully.\u201d Renault said its board had been unable to press ahead with the deal because French government representatives had requested a postponement of the vote. The French government holds a stake of more than 15% in Renault. Japan\u2019s Nissan also owns 15%, while Renault owns 43% of Nissan. Fending off criticism, the French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said the French state had engaged constructively with all partners in the negotiations but that agreement had not been reached on all the government\u2019s conditions for a deal. \u201cWhat remained to be obtained was the explicit support of Nissan,\u201d Le Maire said. Nissan had said it would abstain in the Renault board\u2019s vote on the merger proposal because it needed time to analyse it. Nissan\u2019s chief executive, Hiroto Saikawa, said it would require a fundamental review of its relationship with Renault. Renault expressed disappointment at the collapse of the merger, saying: \u201cWe are gratified by the constructive approach of Nissan and wish to thank FCA for their efforts and Renault\u2019s board of directors for its continued confidence. \u201cWe view the opportunity as timely, having compelling industrial logic and great financial merit, and which would result in a European-based global auto powerhouse.\u201d The Italian deputy prime minister, Luigi Di Maio, weighed in, saying that political interference could be harmful. \u201cWhen politics tries to intervene in economic procedures, they don\u2019t always behave correctly, I don\u2019t want to say any more,\u201d Di Maio, who is also minister for economic development, told Italian radio. One Italian union leader accused France of \u201cprovincialism\u201d. FCA has been on the lookout for a merger for some time and previously held talks with the Peugeot maker, PSA Group. On Wednesday, Le Maire had said there was no need to rush through a deal, adding that the government wanted guarantees over Renault jobs, a headquarters in Paris and corporate governance. \u201cWe want to do this merger,\u201d he told BFM TV. Fiat Chrysler announced a proposed merger with Renault last week. Carmakers around the world are under pressure to invest in electric and self-driving cars. The combined company would have produced 8.7m vehicles annually and saved \u20ac5bn a year by sharing research, purchasing and other activities, Fiat Chrysler argued. It said the deal would not lead to factory closures, but did not rule out job cuts. Under the original proposals, the joint company would have been 50% owned by Fiat Chrysler shareholders and 50% by Renault shareholders. Ana Nicholls, director of industry operations at the Economist Intelligence Unit, said Nissan and Renault\u2019s unions were probably also barriers. \u201cFor Nissan, the deal would have complicated its already dicey alliance with Renault. By bulking up the French company and changing its board, it would have diluted Nissan\u2019s influence\u2026 FCA is also a key competitor for Nissan in several markets, most importantly North America, which would have made sharing technology difficult."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
