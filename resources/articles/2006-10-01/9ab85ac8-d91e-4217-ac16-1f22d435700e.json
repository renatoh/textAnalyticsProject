Ten of the venues for the 2006 season have been retained but the race at Imola has been moved to Vallelunga, near Rome. There is a round at San Marino but it is not yet clear if it will be at Misano or another circuit. The countries and venues for three of the rounds have not been announced but South Africa, due to host the final race this year before being dropped, could return. The series organisers, FG Sport, are also known to be keen to return to North America. Brands Hatch hosts the British grand prix on August 5."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
