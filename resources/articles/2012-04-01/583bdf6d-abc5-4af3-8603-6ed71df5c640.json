Boasting an ideal profile for this contest, with plenty of solid form against good horses to his name, his relatively light campaign should ensure he comes here fresh too. He was never able to land a blow in the Cheltenham Gold Cup last time but nor should he have been able to on the ratings and to be beaten less than 20 lengths at the line was no disgrace. How many times have we seen Knockara Beau sprinting up the hill at Cheltenham at the end of three or three and a quarter miles? He has been crying out for this extra emphasis on his stamina and has a touch of class on his day. Newbury 2.00 Soft ground suits Harris Tweed, who is thoroughly deserving of a first Group-race success. His excellent second in the Hardwicke at Royal Ascot came in similar conditions. Ayr 2.15 Pure Faith, out of his depth behind Finian's Rainbow at Aintree last week, could surprise a few if he settles well in the early stages. Newbury 2.35 If Best Terms is given the go-ahead to line up, the Richard Hannon-trained filly will take a great deal of beating. Even if she has not developed physically as much as some, a repeat of her Lowther Stakes victory still puts her well clear of her rivals. Ayr 2.50 At this stage of the jump season it can pay to start thinking adventurously and Edgardo Sol's long campaign will catch up with him at some stage. Desert Cry is worth chancing. He overtook a lot of horses when coming from well back in the County Hurdle at Cheltenham. Newbury 3.10 With the stable having already taken one leading trial for the 2,000 Guineas, Bronterre can strengthen the Hannon hand further here. He was still learning when fourth in the Dewhurst on his final start last season. Newbury 3.45 There are a number of interesting, lightly raced horses who could theoretically prove a long way ahead of the handicapper but I would rather stick with Mull Of Killough, who handles soft ground and flew home for second in the Lincoln. A 3lb rise in the weights for his latest performance is perfectly fair."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
