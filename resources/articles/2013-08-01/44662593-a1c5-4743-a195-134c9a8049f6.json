The Republic of Ireland midfielder could miss the Premier League opener at Norwich City, and possibly longer, after injuring a knee in the first half of Everton's 2-1 friendly defeat of Real Betis on Sunday. Gibson felt a problem during the warm-up but started for Mart\u00ednez's team before being replaced by John Heitinga. He is due to have a scan to discover the extent of the problem within 48 hours. Gibson would be a serious loss to Everton's midfield, particularly with doubts over the Goodison future of Marouane Fellaini. Fellaini missed the Betis game due to an infected cut in a leg, though he watched in the company of his agent and would have played had the game been competitive, Mart\u00ednez confirmed. Manchester United have been linked with a move for the Belgium midfielder, who will be fit for international duty in midweek."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
