But, according to Peter Luff, chairman of the Commons trade and industry select committee, it may come to be seen as little more than a rubber stamp for Mr Blair's own views. \"It is vital that the government's energy policy is based on a full consideration of the evidence, and has broad political and public support - otherwise, we risk repeating the mistakes of the past. \"However, the review risks being seen as little more than a rubber-stamping exercise for a decision the prime minister took some time ago,\" Mr Luff said. The review was launched this year amid anxiety about Britain's growing dependence on imported gas as supplies from the North Sea dwindle, and on concerns about the country's ability to generate enough electricity as ageing nuclear power stations are shut down and some coal-fired capacity is closed to meet EU emission rules. It will conclude that new nuclear generating capacity should play an important part in meeting our future energy needs - nuclear power currently supplies a fifth of the UK's electricity. The review is also expected to back a variety of technologies, envisaging up to 20% of Britain's power coming from wind, tidal, solar and agricultural sources. In today's report, New nuclear? Examining the issues, the all-party select committee argues that \"a full and proper assessment of the projected future generating capacity should have been conducted to inform debate before the government undertook its review\". It claims that the review could be overstating the problem of an imminent energy crisis, since some existing nuclear plants might see their working lives extended. The MPs also warn that building new nuclear plants on existing sites, as the review is expected to suggest, could pose problems, since these sites could be affected by rising sea levels and coastal erosion. The report advocates more research before new plants can be built. In addition, neither of the two main reactor designs which are viable for the UK has been built. Which means there are technical and cost uncertainties. The report raises concerns that the review is being undertaken with little consideration for the need for cross-party involvement. \"Whilst we do not deny that energy policy requires political as well as economic judgments, the failure to include the main political parties in the process militates against the possibility that they will sign up to the final outcome,\" the committee concludes. It warns that the public will not give its backing to a new generation of nuclear power stations, unless that new capacity is seen as part of an overall energy strategy which includes renewable energy and measures to promote energy efficiency. In addition to the practical problems, the MPs are concerned by what they see as ethical considerations which will ultimately require political judgment. \"These include: whether it is right to create new radioactive waste; whether the UK's nuclear policy poses security risks and undermines efforts to prevent proliferation; and the extent to which the UK needs to demonstrate leadership in reducing carbon emissions.\" Mr Luff said: \"This unanimous report from MPs, with different views on the merits of nuclear power, should provide parliament and the public with a useful summary - a checklist - of the major questions against which the government's policy on nuclear power can be judged.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
