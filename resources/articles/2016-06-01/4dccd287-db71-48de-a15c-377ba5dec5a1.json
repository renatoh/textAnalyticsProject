The poll of 1,867 people, released on Monday, shows support for independents up three points to 15%. All three major parties recorded a one point fall in their primary vote, with the Coalition down to 40%, Labor down to 35% and the Greens down to 10%. The 50-50 two-party-preferred result matches the latest ReachTEL poll released on Friday, but is a one-point improvement for the government compared with the last Newspoll and an Ipsos poll released on Saturday. The 15% primary vote for micro-parties and independents is made up of 3% who support the Nick Xenophon Team, 3% for Family First, 1% for each of the Palmer United party and One Nation and 7% for others. The vote share for the Greens, minor parties and independents combined is 25%, higher than the record of 21% for non-major parties at the 1998 and 2013 elections. On Saturday Malcolm Turnbull urged voters to \u201cprevent the chaos of a hung parliament\u201d and \u201cyet another minority government\u201d as he campaigned in Adelaide. \u201cEvery single vote for Nick Xenophon, the independents, the Greens or Labor, brings us closer to Bill Shorten and the Greens running Australia,\u201d he said. In Friday\u2019s ReachTEL poll, the Nick Xenophon Team recorded a primary vote of 23.5% and 21.3% in the South Australian seats of Mayo and Sturt, suggesting it may be able to win the seats with Labor and Greens preferences. Satisfaction with Turnbull\u2019s performance fell one point to 37%; dissatisfaction was up one point to 51%. Turnbull\u2019s net satisfaction rating has fallen to minus 14 as a result. Satisfaction with Bill Shorten\u2019s performance fell four points to 33%; dissatisfaction was up three points to 52% for a net satisfaction rating of minus 19. Respondents preferred Turnbull to Shorten as prime minister by 45 points to 30, with 25% undecided. The Newspoll was conducted between Thursday and Sunday. In that time Turnbull has defended proposed changes to superannuation, shutting down claims the government would change its plans to tighten tax concessions for high income earners. Speaking on ABC\u2019s AM on Monday, Nick Xenophon said he hoped his party would win three Senate seats in South Australia and one or two in the eastern states. \u201cAt the halfway point, there\u2019s all this fear and loathing from the major parties towards me and the team,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact is we haven\u2019t run one TV ad, not one radio ad, and not one newspaper ad because we just don\u2019t have the dough. If we do manage to cause upsets on the basis of almost no political advertising, that puts political campaigns on its head and I still can\u2019t imagine that.\u201d Xenophon said voters were disillusioned and in South Australia they were worried the government\u2019s defence industry plan would create no jobs for six years. Xenophon denied he was a protectionist, but said free trade agreements had been poorly negotiated. But he advocated buy-Australian provisions in government procurement. Independent Andrew Wilkie told ABC on Monday the high vote for minor parties and independents was \u201ca wonderful opportunity in the next parliament\u201d for a strong crossbench, particularly a strong crossbench that supported his proposed poker machine reform."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
