But one senior US intelligence official in Washington said there was \"no evidence whatsoever\" that Bin Laden had any involvement in the plot or even knew about it in advance. Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the Nigerian student accused of attempting to carry out the attack, has told investigators that he was trained by al-Qaida operatives in Yemen. David Miliband, the foreign secretary, said today that al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (Aqap) had been \"rising on our radar\" for 18 months to two years before the Christmas Day attack showed it had a global reach. Officials in Sana'a estimate that Aqap has 200-300 fighters in a few remote areas. These include Yemenis, Saudis and Egyptians. But Abdulelah Shaea, a journalist who has met its leaders, says it has only a few dozen core members. The Yemeni government's view is that the group can be defeated with local firepower and financial and intelligence help from the US, but that there is a political cost to consider. Yemeni forces who stormed \"terrorist nests\" in Arhab last month were attacked by tribesmen afterwards. And demonstrations erupted in Shabwa when most of those killed in an air strike were women and children. That raid was triggered when a communications intercept picked up the presence of an Aqap leader. Aqap was set up a year ago in a merger of the Saudi and Yemeni franchises of Osama bin Laden's group. Intelligence experts say the first sign of its deadly capabilities came last August when a supposedly repentant Saudi jihadi from Yemen blew himself up in the home of Prince Muhammad bin Nayef, the deputy Saudi security chief, using a bomb hidden in his rectum. The prince survived. Angered by the sluggish pace and bungled publicity of Yemen's operations, the US is said to have suggested that its security forces use DNA tests to prove beyond doubt that it has killed wanted Aqap men; or, failing that, check their dental records \u2013 only to be told that is not feasible in a country where most people never go to the dentist.
