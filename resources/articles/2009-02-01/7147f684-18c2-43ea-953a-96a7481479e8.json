While his ratings have declined recently, 74% of Russians still approve of the job he is doing, according to a survey this month by the state-run pollster, Public Opinion Research. At the same time, the system of government known as Putinism that brought him virtually unchallenged control of Russia's affairs over the past decade is in less robust health. Some Kremlin watchers suggest it may be terminally ill. Put simply, Putinism is an informal social contract by which ordinary Russians have given Putin their unquestioning political support in return for rising living standards and increased national self-respect after the post-Soviet humiliations of the 1990s. Putin's problem is that, increasingly, he cannot deliver his side of the bargain. An almost 20% devaluation of the rouble, sharp drops in share prices and inward investment, a 16% year-on-year plunge in industrial output, and growing problems over wage arrears - all linked to the collapse of oil export prices that are Russia's lifeblood - have punctured the cocksure confidence that has long characterised Putin's leadership. Speaking in Davos last month, Putin finally conceded the crisis was not all the west's fault, and that over-dependence on energy exports had affected Russia \"in an extremely serious way\". Russia's huge but fast dwindling currency reserves alone could not solve the problem. While Putin has mostly avoided taking personal blame so far, these developments are undermining the Putinist social contract. Recent street riots in Vladivostok over price rises were one of the more obvious consequences; the Kremlin clearly fears they may be emulated elsewhere. More intriguing is the up-tick in overtly political domestic challenges to Putin's dominance \u2013 and the way the crisis is impacting on Russia's international behaviour. Putin's policies have faced unusual criticism in parliament and from an old rival, Yuri Luzhkov, the mayor of Moscow. Luzhkov said the government had failed to invest windfall oil profits in jobs and business. \"This money did not help develop our economy. We had zero (investment) in infrastructure projects, zero or very little at the best for ... the real economy. These are the reasons explaining our crisis.\" Dmitry Medvedev, the Putin prot\u00e9g\u00e9 elevated to the presidency last year, has also been making waves, prompting speculation that he is looking towards a post-Putin era. Medvedev has, in quick succession, publicly criticised the government's economic management, started giving televised fireside chats to show he understands the nation's pain, ostentatiously fired supposedly incompetent provincial bosses, and opposed a tough line taken by Putin on the Vladivostok riots. According to one report from Moscow, the relationship between the two men has deteriorated to the point that they agreed recently that a note-taker should keep a record of future meetings to avoid \"misunderstandings\". Less than a year ago, such presumption in dealing with the all-powerful Putin was all but unthinkable. The weakening of Putinism's grip is also changing the way Russia behaves internationally. After a frosty stand-off dating from last summer's Georgia crisis, foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has agreed to meet his new US counterpart, Hillary Clinton, next month. The chastened Putin of the Davos meeting spoke of the need \"to make international relations less dangerous\" and encourage \"mutual trust\". Now, suddenly, a range of new cooperative arrangements appear on the cards. They potentially include an agreement to pursue deep cuts in the two countries' strategic nuclear arsenals, a compromise on missile defence linked to a more consensual stance on Iran, and greater emphasis on joint efforts to combat Islamist extremism in Afghanistan, Pakistan and central Asia. This does not mean Russia is Washington's new best friend. Evidence that Putinism is not yet dead was to be found in the decision by Kyrgyzstan to close the US Afghanistan supply base there, following lucrative blandishments from Moscow. The quintessentially Putinesque determination to retain spheres of influence beyond Russia's borders has not changed. But hard times and tighter belts appear to be bringing growing Russian understanding of the depths of mutual inter-dependence at the exact moment that Barack Obama, a post-ideological, foreign policy realist, takes the helm. It could turn out to be a happy coincidence. Russia cannot afford Putinism's posturing any more. But more to the point, if things go better with Washington, it may not need it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
