They will take a break from royal duties for the rest of the summer and do no more than one or two engagements a month in the autumn and winter. It was said that they wanted to avoid taking attention away from the Queen and Prince of Wales in the runup to the Queen's diamond jubilee next summer. But other reasons were also given. William, 29, hopes to be promoted by earning his captaincy in the RAF search and rescue force early next year and has to complete extra hours flying and studying to progress from being a co-pilot to taking charge of his own Sea King helicopter. The couple want to settle into their marriage after a busy period since their wedding in April, during which they have fulfilled official engagements at home and undertaken a strenuous overseas tour. They are based in Anglesey, where the duke is undertaking air sea rescue duties. It was said the couple hoped to emulate the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh who, early in their married life, were based for a short period in Malta because of Prince Philip's naval career. The spokesman said the duchess had a busy schedule of meetings with charity representatives to allow her to understand the work of her husband's patronages and to decide which causes she wishes to support. The announcement is likely to increase speculation that the couple are hoping for a child soon. The duchess confided to a spectator during their Canadian tour that she wants to have children \u2013 an admission that would only have been controversial if she had said the opposite, but which will whet tabloid appetites for an early announcement. But their spokesman said: \"They are very conscious to make sure that the runup to 2012 is the Queen's year. She quite rightly should be in the spotlight. \"The Queen and the Prince of Wales are fully aware of their plan to go under the radar in the next few months and are very supportive of it.\" The couple will be expected to be involved in official duties supporting the London Olympics and William is due to be posted to the Falkland Islands without his wife for two months next year, as it is classed as an unaccompanied deployment. Despite a busy summer, the duke has managed to complete his RAF duties, flying at least the minimum number of required hours \u2013 eight 24-hour shifts in the air and eight 24-hour shifts on call. The spokesman said: \"To get his captaincy you have to do over and above that and have extra training. He is going for his flying captaincy in early 2012 and will move from the right to the left seat. He needs to keep up his flying hours and there are some exams to get through. A lot of work needs to be done and he has to dedicate himself to that. \"The second reason is more personal really. Despite what some people think, they haven't had a home together before. Since they got married they were on honeymoon, in London for most of June for family events and other events and want to go back and have a married life together under the radar and enjoy their life in Anglesey and keeping things chilled. \"The third reason is the duchess: she has got a lot of things in the pipeline in terms of meeting representatives of charities and lots of the duke's charities so she can begin to know his work better and get to know what she wants to take on. She is already interested in particular in things like sports therapy and arts therapy. She has got to determine what her interests are and whether she can actually make a difference.\" The spokesman said the couple were delighted with the reception they had received in Canada and California. \"They think it's gone really well,\" he said. \"They have just been on such a buzz every day, coming back full of stories. They have really enjoyed it.\" \u2022 This article was amended on 12 July 2011.
