United\u2019s manager struck a pessimistic tone when asked whether greater consistency would allow his team to challenge City\u2019s supremacy, pointing out that Pep Guardiola\u2019s side have set a remarkable pace at the top of the table. \u201cIt depends on what your opponents do,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cI was champion in Spain with 100 points and Barcelona had 91 points. Ninety-one points was a failure for Barcelona? I don\u2019t think it was but the other guys did 100 points. \u201cSo in this season many clubs had positive seasons, like us, like Tottenham, like Liverpool. But it was impossible because City were really good and consistent and will reach a number of points that makes it impossible for you. If they do the same number of points [next season] it will be almost impossible. If they get into 90-something points, it is almost impossible.\u201d City have 87 points from 33 games and need nine more to break the record set by Mourinho\u2019s Chelsea team in 2005. \u201cI was champions with Chelsea with 95 points,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cWe gave no chance to the opponents, which is what Manchester City did. We had periods of winning matches and waiting for them to lose a couple of points. They never did it. \u201cEven when they were almost losing points they managed to win against Bournemouth in minute 145 and some other matches where they won in 90-something. They were really strong. That is why there is no question about who deserves to be champions.\u201d United prepared for Saturday\u2019s FA Cup semi-final against Tottenham by beating Bournemouth on Wednesday, with Paul Pogba recovering well from his disappointing display in last Sunday\u2019s defeat by West Brom. \u201cI told him after the Manchester City game that I am not expecting him to be the man of the match in every match,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cI am not expecting him to be phenomenal in every match, because that is really difficult, but to keep a certain level is the challenge. \u201cHe was phenomenal against City. I think he was not good against West Brom. And I think he was phenomenal again against Bournemouth. Against City you have the two goals where people can say: \u2018Wow, super decisive.\u2019 But I think he played even better against Bournemouth. Since minute one he was more consistent, more in control of the game.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
