According to Deadline, the 12 Years a Slave director will be working with the rapper\u2019s family on the authorized project. The film will be a collaboration between Amaru Entertainment, a company created by his mother Afeni Shakur, and White Horse pictures. Producers include Jayson Jackson of What Happened, Miss Simone? and Nigel Sinclair, whose credits include Rush and The Woman in Black. Gloria Cox, Tupac\u2019s aunt, will act as executive producer. \u201cI am extremely moved and excited to be exploring the life and times of this legendary artist,\u201d McQueen said. \u201cI attended NYU film school in 1993 and can remember the unfolding hip-hop world and mine overlapping with Tupac\u2019s through a mutual friend in a small way. Few, if any shined brighter than Tupac Shakur. I look forward to working closely with his family to tell the unvarnished story of this talented man.\u201d This year will also see the release of Tupac biopic All Eyez On Me while Johnny Depp is set to headline LAByrinth, about the murders of both Tupac and Notorious BIG. McQueen\u2019s credits also include Hunger and Shame, and he\u2019s currently working on a big screen adaptation of British TV thriller Widows starring Viola Davis, Liam Neeson, Andre Holland, Daniel Kaluuya, Michelle Rodriguez and Robert Duvall."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
