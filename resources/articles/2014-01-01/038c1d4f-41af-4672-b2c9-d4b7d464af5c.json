Those who bemoan the disappearance of the beautiful goldfinch from many parts of England will be pleased to hear that on the Cornish cliffs at the present time \"wherever there are thistles\" there are \"large flocks of goldfinches.\" Bird-catchers are charged with causing the decline of the goldfinch, but the accusation is not quite correct. The spread of cultivation and the growth of \"clean\" farming is really responsible for the decline, although when once the birds' numbers are reduced bird-catching may directly cause extinction. The goldfinch is a feeder on the seeds of weeds \u2013 a real farmers' friend, - but there are even more effective ways of getting rid of weeds than in trusting in nature's aids, and the goldfinch and linnet are superseded. Only when thistles and other rank weeds are allowed to grow can we now find the goldfinch in abundance, and in these places the number of birds caught make very little difference."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
