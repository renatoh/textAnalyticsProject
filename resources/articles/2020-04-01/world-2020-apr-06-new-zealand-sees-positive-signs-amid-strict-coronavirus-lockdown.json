New Zealand\u2019s 5 million people have been in total lockdown for nearly two weeks, with no-one allowed to leave their home unless fetching essential supplies, or taking exercise. With a record number of tests conducted on Sunday, director-general of health, Dr Ashley Bloomfield, said the number of cases had begun to stabilise, with 39 new confirmed cases and 28 new probable cases, bringing the total to 1106. A total of 13 people were being treated for the illness in hospital, Bloomfield said, including three in intensive care units, with one of those in a critical condition. So far one person has died from the virus in New Zealand, a woman in her 70s with underlying health conditions on the west coast. Bloomfield said he was cautiously optimistic that it appeared coronavirus cases were beginning to flatten out, and it appeared the government\u2019s swift move from level two to four in the space of two days seemed to be working in containing the virus, and stopping widespread community outbreak. \u201cSo some success so far, but our aim is to stamp it out,\u201d Dr Bloomfield said. The cautious optimism came as the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said she would not rule out her and her ministers taking a pay cut to ensure they played their part in getting the country and the economy back on its feet. \u201cI know my colleagues well and I know we are all acutely aware of the pain our communities are feeling, so you can imagine the kinds of discussions we\u2019ve been having \u2013 I won\u2019t rule it out,\u201d Ardern said of a potential cut. Ardern makes more than NZ$400,000 a year, while her ministers make more than NZ$200,000. \u2018I haven\u2019t given any specificity on numbers or reach, but I won\u2019t rule it out, I think I know pretty well the people I work with.\u201d Ardern said she was quietly pleased with the progress New Zealand was making with containing the virus, but quashed mounting speculation that the country may move out of total lockdown early. Ardern said the fastest way for Kiwis to get out of lockdown was by adhering to the rules of it and waiting it out. \u201cWe have positive signs, not least the fact that we could have had 4,000 cases now, instead of 1,000,\u201d Ardern said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to get ahead of ourselves \u2026 though the signs are positive.\u201d Regions of the country with a high number of cases \u2013 including Auckland and the deep south \u2013 may remain in lockdown longer, Ardern said, and all regions of New Zealand should be prepared for moving in and out of the different alert levels, depending on their situation, after the month-long lockdown ends."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
