With presidents Donald Trump and Hassan Rouhani escalating their rhetoric against each other, traditional US allies have expressed concerns about entering \u201can accidental war\u201d. In the last 24 hours, Trump threatened Iran with \u201cobliteration\u201d while Rouhani labelled the US leader as suffering from a mental disorder. The British foreign minister and prime ministerial hopeful, Jeremy Hunt, told the House of Commons he did not anticipate the UK joining any military action, saying the Foreign Office was very concerned about the \u201crisks of an accidental war\u201d. \u201cThe US is our closest ally \u2013 we talk to them the whole time, we consider any requests that they say carefully \u2013 but I cannot envisage any situation where they request or we agree to any moves to go to war,\u201d Hunt said. Like North Korea, Iran is expected to be a key topic of conversations between leaders at the Group of 20 in Japan this week, where Scott Morrison will meet Trump. But while Australia was keeping a keen eye on the situation, Birmingham said, no decisions about future action \u2013 sanctions or otherwise \u2013 had yet been made. \u201cWe have serious concerns around Iran\u2019s destabilising behaviour,\u201d Birmingham told ABC radio on Wednesday. \u201cWe urge calm from the Iranians in their response to at what at present are purely economic sanctions. \u201cBut economic sanctions designed to influence the behaviour of a state to prevent them from the escalation of development of nuclear technologies, and military activities and terrorism activities that could well undermine the peace and prosperity of the rest of the world.\u201d Australia maintains the sanctions the UN security council placed on Iran, as well as autonomous sanctions around goods and services, including arms and some metals. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In May 2018 the US reinstated all previous sanctions it had placed on Iran after Trump withdrew the US from the joint comprehensive plan of action set up under the Obama administration. Birmingham said Australia continued to review its sanctions. Labor\u2019s deputy leader, Richard Marles, said he believed any move by Australia would \u201chave to be considered very carefully\u201d but he shared Birmingham\u2019s concerns about Iran and destabilisation in the region. \u201cIn terms of the rhetoric, I think we\u2019ve seen this before and I tend to judge based on actions, rather than words what\u2019s going on with the American administration,\u201d he told the ABC. \u201cObviously this rhetoric is concerning \u2013 but the actions of Iran have been concerning. That said, we need to move forward in a very sober and measured way here. And it\u2019s important to understand exactly, what is, if anything, being asked of Australia. \u201cThat\u2019s the briefing we have sought from the government and we\u2019ll be getting that next week.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
