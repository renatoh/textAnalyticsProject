In March 2012 Barack Obama was caught on microphone telling the Russian leader, Dmitry Medvedev, that \"after my election I have more flexibility\" during what the two leaders thought was a private conversation. On Monday, the US president was caught off guard again, this time while chatting to a UN official. Not realising that a CNN microphone was in the vicinity, he said he hoped the official had given up smoking. After the official appeared to ask Obama about his own smoking habits, Obama said he hadn't had a cigarette in probably six years. He added, with a broad grin: \"That's because I'm scared of my wife.\" The exchange was caught on camera and aired on CNN. He may be even more scared of his wife now. \u2022 The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, was the host of a high-powered lunch in New York, with a string of heads of state due to sit down and scoff an extensive menu. The big question was whether they would all stay awake for the afternoon session after a meal consisting of the following (not to mention the delicious selection of wines lined up to slosh it down with): Tuna tartare and avocado Micro rainbow greens, cheese crisp Caper berry, grapefruit salad Veal ossobuco Milanese Potato au gratin, sauteed Swiss chard, truffle-veal jus Salted caramel chocolate mousse Biscotti, vanilla, chocolate and mango sauce"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
