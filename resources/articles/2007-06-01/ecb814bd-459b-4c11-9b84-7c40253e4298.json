At that point my brother-in-law rang on the mobile: 'I'm on the ferry waving, see you at the other end!' I should have taken this as an omen. We finally rolled up at our self-catering cottage, somewhere in darkest Normandy, around 3am. But Madame had assured us that, whatever the time, she would be there for us. As indeed she was, but unfortunately so too was her lover, as she had not been expecting us until the following day. As we sat making polite broken French conversation, clutching mugs of black tea and traditional 'cake' (that tasted like clay) we pondered what else could possibly go wrong ... The three 'bedrooms' we had been expecting turned out to be linked, so our young teenagers were not only sharing but had to pass through the other rooms to reach their own. My brother-in-law's bed was on a sort of landing next to the stairs and on the second morning he announced: 'Did you hear that gnawing in the rafters?' It turned out to be rats. In short the holiday was a disaster - the cottage had not been cleaned (and it transpired that Madame/ the cleaner had been diddling the English owners); our youngest spent most of the time hunting for a mobile signal so she could phone her new boyfriend back home, and our elderly Astra developed a bronchial complaint that meant whenever we sat in it we never knew if it would start or not. The coup de grace was a visit to Mont St Michel - which turned out to be a death-trap of seething humanity. And missing the return ferry home really rounded off our holiday from hell nicely. \u00b7 Have you had a crap holiday? If so, write in and tell us about it.
