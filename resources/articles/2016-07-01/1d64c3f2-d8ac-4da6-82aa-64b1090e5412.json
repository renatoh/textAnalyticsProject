He spoke about unease among Europeans in Britain, French people having doors slammed in their faces since Brexit, about having caught a taxi, and the driver refusing to speak to him. \u201cDo you agree with him?\u201d Madame Tilman wrote on a note. France, gearing up for a tactical presidential vote against neo-fascist Marine Le Pen, is not in a comfortable position to lecture Britain on racism, and when I met good Madame Tilman on the stairs, I found myself insisting that for every attack on Poles or other Europeans in broken, Brexit Britain, there were a dozen bunches of flowers, missives of solidarity. I was lying to myself, and partly to her. It is excruciating, shameful, appalling \u2013 not just the spike in hate crimes, the whole damned Brexit thing. I can hardly cross my courtyard without meeting neighbours mostly just baffled, astonished that such stupidity can have triumphed \u2013 or amused, like the Charlie Hebdo cover showing a businessman sitting on the toilet, pants down, in a shack on an island, looking at the Sun: \u201cAt last, the English are masters of their own home.\u201d I have presumed a Brexit for many years, and started betting on it long before the referendum was announced. Nothing major: and there\u2019s no told-you-so pleasure in now harvesting the modest, bitter rewards from William Hill and from friends and colleagues. For this reason, obliged to sell my flat in London to pay debts, I bought this little place in Paris with what was left, hoping that extracommunautaire Brits who pay property tax in the EU will have some right of abode \u2013 200,000 here, half a million in Spain. For me, departure from Europe was a given: in the tea leaves at a deep and mainstream cultural level beyond the slaughter at Heysel stadium and serial record of England\u2019s football fans, or politicians\u2019 Eurosceptic ranting. It was in the tarot cards of those bulimic, retarded royal occasions \u2013 jubilee, wedding, babies; in the sickly nostalgia of The King\u2019s Speech; in the Olympic Games and Boris\u2019s parachute \u2013 like Ukip on bad acid. Above all, over the crisis of wretched refugees and migrants, it howled from the pages of newspapers like the Sun, which has never lost an election and wasn\u2019t going to lose this one. Even the witless Remain campaign never talked about the grand vision of Jean Monnet, or reasons why the second half of the 20th century in Europe was so different from the first \u2013 only about \u201cBritain\u2019s interests\u201d and money. You could argue that Britain was never in Europe anyway: within five years of my casting my first-ever vote in 1975, to remain in the common market, Europe was on the receiving end of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s handbaggery, then Tony Blair\u2019s prostration to the Bush-Cheney-Rumsfeld axis, now David Cameron\u2019s aggressive whingeing that got us where we are \u2013 out. How many town and city halls flew the starry flag like they do in Europe? None. The harsh \u201cUK border\u201d was always articulate: that absurd moment at any European airport: this way for Madrid, Athens, Stockholm, etc. That way for Moscow, Bogot\u00e1 \u2013 and London. \u201cI go to stations in Paris to catch a train anywhere in Europe,\u201d says my friend Henri Peretz across the road, \u201cbut not the Eurostar. For that, I wait to show my passport. You were never in Europe.\u201d I\u2019ve been, all my life, a passionate European. Before that first vote aged 21, I was forever on the ferry to Boulogne and night trains south from Paris \u2013 during the days when Italian customs officers woke you at Chiasso. I wore Kickers because I thought they look \u201ccontinental\u201d; my first car was a Citro\u00ebn 2CV with the steering wheel deliberately on the \u201cwrong\u201d (ergo, European) side, for the hell of it. Two similarly kitted Renault 5s followed \u2013 not until the late 80s did I steer on the \u201cright\u201d side. So it\u2019s ghastly reading the newspapers here. Le Monde coined the whole thing as a Shakespearean tragedy in four acts, replete with citations from Macbeth and Hamlet, concluding: \u201cBritain, so proud of its democratic tradition, is now falling through every crevice of its own making, with no idea what to do post-Brexit.\u201d The paper later reported from what is left of south Wales\u2019s precarious steel communities, to find that \u201cno one talks about the \u00a3245m Wales received from Europe in 2015, but they talk much about immigration from eastern Europe\u201d.The conservative magazine Le Point felt sorry for Scotland, Northern Ireland and London, \u201cthe future ex-capital of finance. Great Britain is dead, long live little England!\u201d It might have added Liverpool, Manchester, Cardiff\u2026 Leftwing Lib\u00e9ration warned scathingly of \u201ca United Kingdom no longer accountable to fiscal directives on secret banking\u2026 a fiscal haven, a Singapore\u201d off the coast of Europe, and scorned chancellor Osborne\u2019s \u201cBrexit recovery plan\u201d of 15% corporation tax. There\u2019s much comment about repatriating the UK border in Calais across the channel, thereby turning it into another refugee graveyard, like the Aegean \u2013 only a cartoon in Marianne magazine shows a raft of people fleeing the cliffs of Dover, towards France. \u201cIt\u2019s the city traders,\u201d says the caption. Charlie Hebdo is of course best known for subversive humour, which can make it France\u2019s most deadly serious paper. One cartoon last week showed a skinhead kicking a coffin across the Channel, saying: \u201cIf you love Europe so much, go there\u201d \u2013 and above, the spine-chilling caption: \u201cJo Cox died for nothing.\u201d I speak with friends, of course: a colleague back from visiting his daughter in Seville reports bewilderment at Britain\u2019s choice among her Spanish friends. From Rome, where I lived happily for years, Olivella Foresta \u2013 a film-maker, says: \u201cI still don\u2019t think it can really be true that England is out of Europe. The image I have in my mind is a self-mutilated body from which one arm has been amputated because of stupidity and very low political concern for the consequences. \u201cIt\u2019s a great loss, not just for economic and political reasons, but for the future of our children who will not be able to exchange experiences, study and work freely both in Italy and England.\u201d In Poland, ultra-right leader of the government party Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski demands \u201ca new treaty attractive to the British\u201d, and the paper Gazeta Wyborcza warns that \u201cthough the party in power proposes that it doesn\u2019t want to leave the EU, some of its leaders are already outside it\u201d. My Polish friends are distressed and outraged. I was with Wojciech Tymowski on the night Poland entered the EU, in 2004, popping champagne on the streets of Warsaw. \u201cNot good,\u201d read a message from him. \u201cThis is very bad news.\u201d \u201cThe victory of Brexit,\u201d says an appalled Urszula Glensk, professor of literature at Wroc\u0142aw University, \u201cis a similar phenomenon to the electoral victory in Poland by the rightwing Kaczy\u0144ski party \u2013 the success of populist democracy and tabloid media. Here, they promised benefits and a reduced retirement age \u2013 and won though no one rational believed them. In England, they promised stable old GB without refugees and migrants \u2013 and won. The triumph of populism, empty promises, lacking scruples and threatening other countries \u2013 a contagious disease.\u201d At my cafe off Avenue du Maine in Paris, regulars gathering for early evening drinks regard Brexit, with some relief to me, as a source of laidback, faintly superior humour. Auguste, focal point of the group, suggests that Britain is, like Venice, an island and like Venice probably sinking, and felt that it needed to decrease the weight of people in order to slow the submergence. \u201cBut it\u2019s the other way round! Now the foreigners will have to leave, and you\u2019ll sink even faster!\u201d With France playing in the Euro final, there\u2019s traction for the joke that Roy Hodgson is the man to negotiate Brexit \u2013 \u201che\u2019d make it quick!\u201d \u2013 but serious concern about complex work permits for French and other European footballers coming to England from below the top-50 rated clubs. Working behind the bar, rock-n-roll-vinyl fan Gabriel makes a more sombre point. \u201cThe Berlin Wall came down when I was two,\u201d he says. \u201cAll my life I\u2019ve been told that walls are coming down all over the world and all I\u2019ve seen is walls going up! Tijuana, Palestine \u2013 and now you\u2019ve put one between Calais and Dover.\u201d On the slipstream of empire, I\u2019ve always thought \u2013 to the point of treason \u2013 of my British passport as a \u201cburden of shame\u201d as UB40 so eloquently put it, \u201ca British subject, not proud of it\u201d. Now, trying to cling on in \u201cthe continent\u201d, it is just a downright embarrassment \u2013 not only a badge of shame, but also, worse in a way, of pointless, bellicose imbecility."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
