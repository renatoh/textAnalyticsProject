Most recently, Lance Franklin got the full treatment in 2008. In truth, the single biggest killer of this tradition is the fact that so few forwards reach the milestone anymore. Time was when there seemed to be a couple every year. Lockett, Dunstall, Ablett and Modra reigned supreme in the early 90s and the people voted with their feet in the most literal sense. The trend also gave rise to another long-forgotten sight at AFL venues: the mounted police squad. That\u2019s probably for the best. Objectors to such displays have a fair point, obviously. Not only do these ground invasions present a public liability minefield for the league and venues, they can prove a momentum-killer in vital late-season clashes and finals. The latter was perhaps best exemplified by the chaos that followed Fraser Gehrig\u2019s 100th goal in the 2004 preliminary final at Football Park. Led by the father of Gehrig\u2019s team-mate Steven Baker, Saints fans poured onto the ground to mob the milestone man and, upon a delayed resumption of play, St Kilda promptly dropped their bundle and watched Port Adelaide snatch the game. Remembered with similar fondness is the anxious wait for the \u2018second siren\u2019, upon which time (until the late 90s, anyway) hordes of supporters would jump the fence armed with footballs and engage in the decidedly less disruptive act of post-game kick-to-kick. Less disruptive unless you were a ground curator, that is. As anyone dodging a waterlogged ball to the head along the concourse outside the AFL\u2019s various super-stadiums these days would know, there\u2019s something to be said for keeping these festivities within the field of play. 2) State of Origin football Much like the closure of a once-hip but sparingly-attended music venue in a gentrified inner suburb, there is something a little bit hypocritical about mourning State of Origin footy. That\u2019s not downplaying the wave of nostalgia as you unearth the thrilling highlights from the 1989 clash between Victoria and South Australia, but by the time the concept\u2019s death knell sounded, not a hell of a lot of us were actually bothering to attend. Will it ever be resurrected? Probably not. Clubs and coaches were paranoid enough about injuries way back in 1989, when Tony Hall suffered his infamous and career-shortening knee injury. They\u2019re even less enamored of the concept now. Still, it was appointment viewing during the 80s and 90s, due in equal parts to the genuinely bitter rivalries of the states involved, the cavalcade of stars that made themselves available for the clashes and the work of men like Ted Whitten and Neil Kerley to foster supporter passion for the games. As for the games themselves, New South Wales\u2019s 1990 triumph against Victoria must rank with the classic upsets of all-time (as does Tasmania\u2019s win against the Vics from the same year, a highlight reel worth checking out for Doug Barwick\u2019s incredible torpedoed goal) and that 1989 clash between the Vics and South Australia was actually bettered by the 1994 equivalent at Football Park, which featured the likes of Ablett, Modra, and Darren Jarman at the peak of their powers. The pure football aesthetic of such encounters is thrilling to watch even now. Whether it was EJ celebrating the fact that the Vics had \u201cstuck it right up \u2018em\u201d and circling the MCG for his emotional lap of honour in 1995 or the glorious, technicolour novelty that was the Allies, there\u2019s something special about the memories of State of Origin footy. It\u2019ll always tug at the heartstrings of us footy nerds who were around to see it. 3) The sartorial splendor of lace-up jumpers Though you\u2019d have to be 35 or older to remember it, the sustained renaissance of the lace-up footy jumper in the 1970s and 80s came to an abrupt end when Melbourne champion Robert Flower became the most high-profile player to seriously injure a finger trying to tackle the wearer of said garment. Infused with the look of football\u2019s foundation years and mythologised for aiding the evasive abilities of players due to its form-hugging properties (supposedly making the player harder to tackle), its demise was inevitable in the professional era. The general consensus (and by general, obviously we mean a BigFooty discussion thread from 2011) is that the lace-up jumper disappeared in 1986, but images of Geelong\u2019s Bruce Lindner and Collingwood\u2019s David Cloke wearing them adorned the pages of the Football Record as late as 1988. Richmond wore them in both their 1974 and 1980 premiership triumphs and the jumpers were immortalised in several iconic footy photos, perhaps most poignantly in the 1974 Rennie Ellis shot of Richmond\u2019s \u2018Bones\u2019 McGhie enjoying a post-game smoke as he sat on the MCG turf. It was also a bit of a South Australian thing, the lace-up jumper. Port Adelaide wore them in SANFL matches well into the late 90s and the Power store now even offers a replica, modeled appropriately enough by club icon and long-time lace-up exponent Russell Ebert. The reason they even made a comeback in the first place during the early 70s was that former SANFL players would move across to Melbourne clubs and bring their old \u2018Vic Hill\u2019 brand jumpers with them. It\u2019s not the only item to disappear from the wardrobes of league players these days. From its zenith in the mid-90s, the wearing of gloves is now confined to a select few including Travis Cloke and Bryce Gibbs. Then there\u2019s the fading memory of Steven \u2018Strawbs\u2019 O\u2019Dwyer and his giant novelty thigh pads, a staple for lumbering ruckmen of the late 1980s and a look also perfected by his team-mate Jim Stynes. 4) Donning a duffle coat You know when a hazy remembrance has you heading online to confirm your suspicions, and you find that Proustian rush is shared by others? That\u2019s the feeling I got when I recently googled: \u201cVFL football duffle coat\u201d. With the help of badges, patches, felt and a rudimentary measure of sewing skill, football fans of the 70s and 80s transformed winter coats into individually-tailored costumes to be worn in the chilly outer of suburban grounds around Melbourne. They were on their way out by the late 80s but they\u2019re everywhere online, a testament to the fondness with which they\u2019re recalled by footy lovers. The Richmond-centric blog \u2018Tiger Tiger Burning Bright\u2019 even has a quite brilliant \u2018virtual duffle coat\u2019 in honour of football\u2019s long-lost but once de rigeur garment. Richmond ones always seemed to look the best, actually. Hawthorn also have some quite brilliant examples in their club museum; ideal bedfellows to the era\u2019s jumpers, scarves and beanies with all of their homespun charm. Cropping up before the advent of mass-produced merchandise, even dodgy efforts had a kind of fascinating folk art quality to them. It\u2019s unlikely that duffle coats will ever reach the popularity of their heyday, but that hasn\u2019t stopped some clubs from marketing more tasteful modern versions of the old favourite. Somehow that just seems to defeat the point though; duffle coats were all about customisation, improvisation and showing your passion through cramming as many names, numbers and faces onto the coat as possible. To see one on an old stager now, normally in the vicinity of the cheer squad, is to smile and remember that long-lost world of \u2018Footy Special\u2019 trams to Carlton and trudging back to the car in the driving rain at Waverley Park. 5) The WEG grand final poster For near-on 60 years there was no more satisfying purchase for the supporter of a Premiership-winning side than one of William Ellis Green\u2019s \u201cWEG\u201d Premiers posters, a tradition started by Green\u2019s employer, the Herald in 1954. That year he produced the first and now most highly-prized example following Footscray\u2019s solitary grand final triumph. With proceeds of the $2 posters having traditionally gone towards the Good Friday Appeal, Green raised over $2m for the cause in his lifetime. Having shunned a potential career as an architect to pursue his passion as a cartoonist, Green\u2019s mother had once warned him of the poverty and starvation his career might bring about. Happily for football fans he proved her wrong. Originally the posters had just been inserted into the Sunday edition of the Herald but by the time of St Kilda\u2019s 1966 triumph (original posters from that year now sell at auction for more than $3,000) they were being sold outside the ground at the conclusion of the game. Though sharing the same aesthetic DNA, each of the posters is unique and imbued with a distinctive sense of symbolism from the game in question. A row of Tigers WEG\u2019s hanging in the back of Richmond\u2019s London Tavern hotel, a short stroll from Punt Road Oval is a good example; displayed en masse they\u2019re powerfully symbolic of the club\u2019s golden era of the 70s and 80s. Green produced posters for 55 consecutive seasons, right up until Hawthorn\u2019s 2008 flag, three months before his death at the age of 85. Though it\u2019s understandable that the Herald Sun wouldn\u2019t want to watch the tradition die, there\u2019s something distinctly underwhelming about the subsequent offerings of Green\u2019s stand-in Mark Knight (a Magpie with sleeve tatts? No thanks). Nothing compares to the original. 6) The stick of gum in a pack of Scanlens footy cards For fans of a certain age, there was nothing that heralded the arrival of a new season more thrillingly than ripping open that first wax pack of Scanlens footy cards. Replete with a thin stick of bubble gum that would leave a fragrant trail of white dust on the first card in the pile, the contents of the Scanlens pack was a simple joy of the pre-internet era. How else would we find out that Gary Lyon\u2019s nickname was \u201cDollars\u201d or that West Coast\u2019s John Annear drew the far less evocative tag of \u201cJA\u201d? Collecting the full set became a season-long crusade, one not helped by a seeming undersupply of certain players and the reluctance of peers to deal away their marquee acquisitions. All of the Bernard Toohey doubles in the state couldn\u2019t secure you a Lockett or Brereton, so the relentless scrounging for enough change to buy another packet was the only way to re-up and finish the whole set. To this day the footy card-collecting bug still descends upon young fans (and mildly scary middle-aged men) at the start of the season, but the days of the stick of gum and made-up nicknames are now a distant memory. You wouldn\u2019t trade them for anything though. Not even a Michael \u2018Disco\u2019 Roach."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
