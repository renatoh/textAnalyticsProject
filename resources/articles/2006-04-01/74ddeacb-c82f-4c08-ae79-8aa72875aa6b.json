Judging by the electoral literature that's come through my door, political parties have given up even pretending that these local elections are about local issues. Voters realised long ago who makes all the important decisions about what their council does and how much it spends. Whitehall doesn't even trust councillors to decide whether library catalogues should be posted on the web. Odd, then, to read an official declaration that councils are on the way back. According to a paper from the Cabinet Office (Transformational local government, www.cio.gov.uk) local government is at a \"tipping point\" thanks to a policy that is \"broadly sympathetic to the value of local public services and local government's role in leading their integration\". The magic ingredient, apparently, is IT. The paper is a discussion document aimed at engaging local authorities in the \"transformational government\" IT strategy published last November. E-government wonks will remember this is all about joining up public services around users' needs, and government agencies saving money by sharing finance and personnel departments, not to mention citizens' personal data. Despite the above, the Cabinet Office can't directly order local councils to do things its way. Hence the need to portray transformation as part of the new \"double devolution\" agenda, of empowering a new tier of local communities. It's not all twaddle. As the paper points out, the local e-government programme between 2000 and 2005 created exciting new channels of engagement between local authorities and their communities, for example allowing us to keep tabs on planning decisions and council meetings electronically. Meanwhile, computerised contact centres, when run properly, give citizens confidence that their inquiries and complaints are being heard. Yet, for all its talk of neighbourhood decision-making, the real thrust of e-government policy appears headed in the opposite direction. Take the local Directgov scheme for \"deep linking\" between the national web portal and local services: the whole idea is to bypass councils' own web pages. Or the Government Connect Programme to plug councils' IT into central systems: it looks like an attempt to turn local authorities into branch offices of national government. Then we have shared services. Although it is patently daft for every single local council to run its own bureaucracy, the government's obsession with cutting the number of call centres squares oddly with local accountability. As the discussion document notes: \"If poorly or inappropriately implemented ... shared services could conflict with many of the other objectives of local government transformation - to devolve power to communities, to deliver more responsive local services, to increase choice and personalisation, to reach excluded groups more effectively.\" Councillors and public sector unions can be expected to make this point forcefully when Whitehall's shared services squads come to call. In fact, to some local authorities, the whole e-government strategy may already look like one giant Trojan horse. For the rest of us, as citizens or businesses, does this really matter? Certainly, the outcry over \"postcode lotteries\" in the NHS suggests limits to our enthusiasm for locally tailored public services. Is it time to knock this sham of local accountability on the head and route all our contacts with officialdom to Whitehall via Chennai? I don't think so. I'd prefer to take at face value the discussion document's thesis that IT can help develop public services that are more locally responsive and more efficient. To get there, as the document says: \"We need to explore the ways in which ICT can inform and support people in making collective choices and finding the right local balance between service quality and cost.\" Which, if anyone would let us, is what we should be voting about in two weeks' time. \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
