As the goals flew in against Millwall I charged on to the pitch as usual, but the ref took umbrage. He claimed I was bringing the game into disrepute. Despite support from the papers and from my mascot pals I was hauled in front of the Welsh FA. I am a mute swan so the club chairman spoke to the committee on my behalf. I got a touchline ban and the club were fined \u00a31,000. Afterwards a scrum of photographers wanted pics of me, a huge white swan, with all the men in suits. Life's been a rollercoaster at the Vetch Field. I've drawn the national lottery, starred in several television shows and I've been asked to stand for the Welsh Assembly (you never know!) Did you hear about the streaker at last year's Mascot Grand National? She was trying to block Chaddy the Owl's path to victory. He skipped round her, but I didn't. It was the best and gentlest rugby tackle I've ever done. Later in the race I came a cropper too - trouble was, everyone assumed I was play-acting. Yorkie the Lion helped me hobble off. I once had a scuffle with Millwall's Zampa the Lion - it ended with his head coming off. Both sets of fans took it in good spirit, but the papers made the most of it. Reputations stick - one of my nicknames is Psycho - but Swansea's fans know I do lots in the community. They've even produced a children's book on me, which proves I'm a good swan. So I say I'm No1 among the mascots. More people have heard of me than any Premiership mascot: Gunnersaurus, Fred the Red, Moonchester - who are they? I'm a household name alongside the likes of Ryan Giggs, Robbie Savage and Swansea's hero Lee Trundle. And I bet my diary has more party bookings than theirs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
