As a teenager she nearly choked on it when her father, Francis, invited her to collaborate on the dismal tale of spoilt Manhattan rich kids he contributed to New York Stories, the portmanteau movie he co-directed with Martin Scorsese and Woody Allen in 1989. Then he embarrassingly miscast her the following year as Michael Corleone's daughter in The Godfather Part III. Fortunately, a decade later she re-established herself, with her father as producer, by making The Virgin Suicides, her assured debut as writer-director. She has now followed it up with the attractive Lost in Translation. Coppola is a confident, cool, detached filmmaker in a manner reminiscent of the European cinema of the Sixties, with suggestions also of classical Japanese film. In The Virgin Suicides, for example, her film about teenage life in the Midwest in the 1970s, a 16-year-old girl returns home from a high school dance after daybreak to strict religious parents who have told her to be home well before midnight. Instead of capturing the characters' distress by having them confront each other face to face, Coppola places her camera about 30 yards from the front door. In a single static shot that frames the whole house and large front garden the family reunion is distanced from us; we catch only the odd word of their angry exchanges and are unable to see the expressions on their faces. There is, more than incidentally, a comic moment in The Virgin Suicides when a sexually aroused boy sees, in his imagination, a pair of salmon-coloured knickers beneath his girl friend's ballgown. In Lost in Translation a similar erotic image is placed behind the opening credits, a shot of an enticing young woman stretched out on a bed, her back to the camera, wearing salmon-pink knickers. Lost in Translation is an elliptical, minimalist romantic comedy set in Tokyo where two Americans, separated in age by a couple of decades, conduct an affair that is all the more erotic for being chaste. Consciously or unconsciously Coppola was probably thinking of Roman Holiday, though it is another film set in Rome that her two principal characters watch on TV - the night scene from La Dolce Vita in which Marcello Mastroianni and Anita Ekberg cavort in the Trevi Fountain. The two visitors are Bob Harris (Billy Murray), a second-rank Hollywood star pushing 50, in Tokyo to shoot a lucrative series of commercials for a brand of Japanese whisky, and Charlotte (Scarlett Johnansson), the 22-year-old wife of a successful photographer (Giovanni Ribisi), who is in Japan to take pictures of a rock group. Both are jet-lagged, bored, insomniac, disoriented, approaching the ends of their tether. Bob has contempt for his work and is bombarded by his wife of 25 years with fax messages about their children's birthdays, phone calls about furnishing their new house, Federal Express packages containing samples of carpeting for him to pass judgment on (or rather, to agree with her about). Charlotte, after two years of marriage, feels neglected and without direction. Her workaholic husband snores all night and then rushes off at daybreak for an out-of-town shoot. She recently graduated with a philosophy degree and has tried writing and photography (a temporary vocation she compares with a girlie passion for horses) and now does little but listen listlessly to a personal improvement CD called A Soul's Search. Charlotte ventures into a Buddhist temple and is frightened that she feels nothing. Bob stoically endures ludicrous sessions with Japanese camera crews. The anonymously modern luxury hotel they stay in is an image of the alienation they share. Neither feels at home in America or Japan. America is represented by a vacuous, motor-mouthed young movie star (Anna Faris), in Tokyo to promote her movie 'Midnight Velocity', and a red-haired lounge singer (Catherine Lambert), whose over-demonstrative style appeals to tourists and middle-aged Japanese businessmen. Japan is just walls of neon signs in the streets, crowds of over-polite servants and karaoke bars. Charlotte and Bob, in fact, could pass with flying colours the Michelangelo Antonioni accidie test for the burnt-out Western bourgeoisie. There is an extraordinary moment when the forlorn Bob goes off alone for a game of golf and we cannot tell whether the distant Mount Fujiyama is the real thing or a painted backdrop to a driving range. But while Lost in Translation is deeply sad and has a strongly Antonioniesque flavour, it's also a wispy romantic comedy with little plot and some well-observed comic moments, like the scene where Bob takes Charlotte to a hospital to have a bruised toe tended to. Scarlett Johansson's Charlotte is sweet-natured, humorous, intelligent and spiritually lost. Bill Murray is one of the greatest, least ingratiating comic actors at work today: appropriately enough he once played a modern version of Scrooge. He looks like a bloodhound with acne scars and is a great put-on artist (were he a soldier he'd spend half his life in the guardhouse for dumb insolence). He's a master of the deadpan and no comedian since Jack Benny has been able to get so many laughs with so little apparent effort - a shift of the head, a half-smile, a tiny grimace. Only occasionally does Murray have a part worthy of his talent, and while this film is not quite in the class of Tootsie, Quick Change (which Murray co-directed), Groundhog Day or Ed Wood, Murray gives one of the past year's best screen performances, investing Bob with an almost tragic sense."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
