Rather than focusing attention on any one area of the company\u2019s business, analyst Priscilla Moriuchi argues corporations, consumers and organisations should instead be wary of the pure variety of products and services offered by the company, which \u201cgenerates a nearly unimaginable amount of data for one company to possess\u201d. \u201cFrom the personal device level (smartphones and wearables) to the network level (routers, switches and 5G base stations) and global level (undersea cables, fibre-optic lines, and \u201csafe city\u201d surveillance systems integration), we can only begin to imagine what a single company can do (whether benign or malign) with access to that scope of information on people, governments, and companies,\u201d Moriuchi adds. \u201cHuawei offers a broader range of products and services than companies traditionally associated with the western technology industry, including Facebook, Microsoft, and Apple. It is a perfect storm of unintended consequences waiting to happen.\u201d Moriuchi, the director of strategic threat development at the cybersecurity company, warns that even the reported sale of the company\u2019s massive underwater cable business would only address a tiny fraction of the problematic scale. \u201cThe breadth of products and services provided by Huawei still places much of the technology supply chain within the domain of one company, and exposes its customers to cross-technology risks.\u201d A search on Shodan, a tool for finding industrial hardware exposed to the internet, for one specific Huawei network device yields almost 10,000 results spread across the globe, Moriuchi notes. \u201cWe believe that the breadth of technologies and range of information that Huawei could have access to,\u201d she concludes, \u201cwill likely be too great an opportunity for Chinese intelligence and security services to pass up. \u201cThis does not mean that Huawei corporate executives would be complicit in, or even knowledgeable of, Chinese military or intelligence efforts to exploit these technologies and data. It does mean Huawei is potentially subjected to a government-driven obligation to capitalise on its global network and consumer devices ecosystem to fulfil core national security and economic dominance objectives.\u201d The report is the latest in a series of blows to Huawei. On Friday, the company was banned by Facebook from pre-installing the social network\u2019s apps on its phones, the latest restriction the company\u2019s consumer business has faced in the wake of a US government ban on American companies exporting components. Google has reportedly launched a campaign to have the ban overturned, arguing that if the company cannot provide the Android operating system to Huawei for use on its smartphones, it will boost Chinese efforts to develop an alternative, ultimately harming US national security more than the status quo."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
