He is contemplating having certain extremities chopped off. The 33-year-old severely injured the little finger on his left hand when he crashed out of the Corsica event this month. \"Colin said to me that, if the damaged finger does get in the way, he'll just have it taken off,\" said Ford's motorsport director Martin Whitaker yesterday. McRae's remark may have been tongue in cheek but the danger of losing the finger is real by competing less than a fortnight after his accident. If he injures it again amputation may become a necessity. \"The problem is the flesh has been damaged so badly it's just not got enough to knit together and the danger is, if I damage that again, it won't knit and that means taking it off,\" McRae said. Carlos Sainz, meanwhile, will compete in Catalonia despite a crash during practice on Monday that has forced him to wear a neck brace. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
