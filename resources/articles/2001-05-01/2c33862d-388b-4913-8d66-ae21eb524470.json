Switch on the skeleton service, now seeking a buyer, and you will see recordings of stockbrokers in suits talking gobbledygook about shares. Funereal. Behind the hype the truth is that the channel attracted zero ratings. Advertisers took one look at it and refused to buy. Faith believes the programming, over which he had no creative control, was boring: \"It was dull, too much stockbroking chat.\" But his overall verdict is this: \"If I had to encapsulate digital TV in one sentence I'd say, 'It's a no-no, the biggest problem is apathy - the public don't give a damn.'\" Digital won't work, he thinks, until the majority are signed up. Is he right? Well, the Money Channel's plight is not the only sign that all is not well in a sector also hit by the sharp slowdown in advertising. Other indicators include BSkyB's declaration of \u00a3367m nine-month losses, cost-cutting at Sky including the closure of Sky News's business unit, and ONdigital's decision to embrace the ITV brand. From a red-blooded capitalist perspective, Adam Faith is echoing what the National Consumer Council and Consumers' Association have been warning for months - that perhaps one third of the public are not interested in multi-channel television, while within that group lies a hard core of refuseniks. Ask industry experts whether we should expect more channel closures and the answer comes back crisp and firm: \"You bet\". While the government wants to see new channels bloom and analogue switched off by 2010, the short-term prospect for digital looks more like meltdown. And what will happen to the rate of conversion from analogue to digital if free connection ends? BSkyB's chief executive Tony Ball is committed to pushing up the amount of revenue it gains per home from \u00a3300 to \u00a3400 a year by 2005. That hardly sounds as if he's plotting universal coverage. \"Very few of the basic free-to-air channels are economically viable,\" observes an operator with years of experience in nursing new channels on air. Another executive, who assesses business plans for new satellite and cable ventures says: \"I sit here wondering, 'Why the hell do you want to launch that? You're not going to make yourself rich.' The reality is most independent channels are going to lose money.\" Ipsos RSL, the research company that conducts a unique independent digital audience tracking service (Dart), notes that 28% of homes are connected to digital, thanks to a very fast conversion led by BSkyB. But the key problem is that people only tend to use a fraction of the services available, at best 15 to 17 channels. Viewers can't keep up and don't have time to watch more. It means dozens of channels have low - 0.1% to zero - ratings. Without a measurable audience, they have nothing to sell to advertisers, and so no income. Nor do people care much for interactive devices - the system of clicking buttons once and twice, which should lead from adverts into requests for information and then onto a sale, producing a cut, and hence extra revenue for the channel. \"The technology has got to be so simple and fast,\" muses Faith, \"with integrated TV sets and no effort, since most of us still can't get to grips with a video machine. It's a very basic flaw. Digital is for anoraks at the moment.\" The marketeers seem to have gone too far ahead of viewers. This lies behind BSkyB's decision to drastically prune and focus its interactive operations, with the stress on betting, games, competitions related to programmes and \"easy to use\" interactive services. It will play a major role in Big Brother II. According to Dart, only 4% of its sample used TV screen email in a month, and only 2% accessed the internet via the TV. The better news is that, over a month, half of digital viewers use games, and one third use interactive football services to hunt down scores. Since most homes have only one reception point for multi-channel, niche networks are unlikely to be chosen by a family. SkyDigital's platform service, which has to be open to outsiders, has seen 67 new services join it in the past year, bringing a total of 280 to its electronic programme guide (EPG). Yet the common theme among advertising agencies, sponsors, everyone involved, is that most operators, like dot.com companies a year ago, have not properly researched where their income - and viewers - will come from. In the 90s, channel operators who owned valuable programme rights could haggle about how many pence they would receive for each home connected, to supplement advertising revenue. But that's rare now for basic tier channels. Many, as Faith found out, have to pay for access. \"A small channel on its own will be doomed to failure,\" say the experts. \"It's all coming down to earth,\" observes Chris Hayward, Zenith Media's director of television. Rupert Gavin, chief executive of BBC Worldwide - answerable for the corporation's joint venture UKTV-branded channels including UK Gold - thinks Britain will end up with about 100 channels. Many of these will be drawing on programme rights and archives owned by existing broadcasters. (One survivor could be a new commercial sports channel just agreed between the BBC and NTL). But even Gavin is cautious. Channel 4 chief executive Michael Jackson, who has predicted convergence between niche channels this year, has confirmed that Channel 4 is not planning any more channel launches at present. It is busily digesting the hard lessons of semi-success from its E4 network, and from FilmFour, which currently has just over half the subscribers it needs to make money. Andy Barnes, Channel 4's director of advertising sales and marketing, says conditions are very tough, but at least he can cut deals. E4 is achieving a respectable, but \"not great\" 0.5% share, with all the advantages of cross promotion, first run popular programmes already known and loved by viewers, and lots of cash. E4's highest-rated programmes for the week starting April 23 were Friends (520,000 viewers) and ER (250,000), with Ally McBeal tenth (80,000). These are fractions of their terrestrial audiences. \"There's this view that if you put a TV channel up, people will watch it. Well, people just don't,\" says Barnes bluntly. \"And if that's Channel 4, what chance have others got?\" The aim is to win a 2% share of audiences within two years, but E4's audience is not as youthful as it expected. Industry observers speculate that BSkyB will be next to close some of its weakest joint-venture channels (National Geographic and .TV are suggested), while established names that have spawned esoteric spin-offs are expected to streamline (an end, perhaps, to Discovery Sci Trek, or Discovery Junior?). Among those well placed are the BBC's licence fee-funded services, with BBC3, BBC4 and two children's channels awaiting the government's green light; operators such as CNN or Eurosport belonging to global networks; and channels based on programme libraries (eg Turner's Cartoon Network, Hallmark). The Community Channel (supported by charities and donations) also looks secure. Tipped for survival too are Emap's Smash Hits and Kerrang! - viewers already know the brands. The Money Channel belonged in the highest risk, free-to-air category, but Faith agrees it had advantages: \"We had massive PR, a great position on the EPG, perfect timing. Our share price rocketed up to 540 pence until the day of transmission. Then people saw the programming. In six months it was down to nothing.\" Ah, the programming. Content, content, content. This is the crunch. Keith Rattray, director of interactive TV at Carat International, says of the Money Channel and its rival Simply Money, which has also been withdrawn: \"We didn't advise clients to go into them. Having seen the format, it was incredibly dull. The internet would be a better bet. If you're buying an ISA you're seeking information, not entertainment.\" Most experts believe that channels which score less than 0.5% of total audience are doomed, unless special circumstances apply - if they appeal to the MTV generation or to wealthy groups - when 0.1% might suffice. \"With digital audiences, it's a little bit like trying to find a needle in a haystack,\" observes Faith. Also, the main channels are obsessed with going the other way, finding so-called water-cooler event programming. So, it seems we are witnessing a Darwinian struggle for survival favouring big broadcasters and established channels. This assists most Sky channels, even Sky News (founded 1989). But the \"early is good\" view creates a real problem for ITV, yet to fully exploit its archive of popular drama under an ITV Gold brand, a missed opportunity. Next clue: viewers will turn to strong programmes regardless of channels: this means that most of the UKTV networks run by BBC/Flextech/Telewest look safe. For example, BBC Style performs strongly because it runs repeats of favourites such as Gardeners' World. Granada Breeze, in the same niche, but with its own programming, struggled to find its feet. Chris Hayward of Zenith Media says: \"You have got to have something of interest to people. And quality. Things have to be done well, you have to have the resources to rectify things if they go wrong.\" Granada, for example, has reworked Men &amp; Motors. Another industry expert says to satellite players: \"Don't buy a studio, spend on quality content. Do a two-hour service, with interactive information. Aspire. If you can, nest on another channel, or go and find a struggling one.\" Carat estimates that this year, digital television will attract \u00a3422m in ad revenue, compared to \u00a3315m, so the trend is up. Faith says: \"In the near future, perhaps two to three years, or five, somebody is going to make an awful lot of money.\" But it depends on user-friendly systems and a mass digital audience. This lies behind the new-style Wimbledon coverage the BBC announced last week. If watching BBC1 or BBC2 via Skydigital, viewers can click the epg's red (interactive) button to access a menu of five live matches, then scroll down and select. Ashley Highfield, director of BBC New Media, says: \"This is mainstream for the masses, keep it simple\". He hopes perhaps 1m of the 5.4m homes receiving Sky's network will have a go. In other words, smart television networks will have to teach their audiences how to interact with digital TV. Meanwhile, the new channels unroll - the Dating Channel, Shop America, Game Network, Online Classics. Just as there's always someone who wants to be a press baron, so the lure of running a television network remains. \"The pioneers are the ones with arrows in their backs,\" observes Adam Faith.
