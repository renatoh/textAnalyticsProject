The Mikhailovsky Company's mixed bill veered between both as eight highlights from the Russian repertory were crammed into an exhausting, fascinating and occasionally preposterous three hours. Most intriguing from the history angle was Le Halte de Cavalrie, a one-act comedy by Marius Petipa, performed here for the first time in London. In the west, we know and love Petipa almost exclusively through his full-length classics; this 1895-ish work, complete with late revisions, turned out to be a small revelation. It inhabits a totally different world to Swan Lake or Sleeping Beauty, given its cast of flirtatious peasant and hussars, and its folk-inflected jumps and military mime. But at the same time it is constructed out of disconcertingly familiar elements - the densely patterned ensembles, the rivalrous heroines and climactic pas de deux - all distilled by Petipa into a single act. It was nicely danced by the Mikhail-ovsky on Sunday; however, it was significant that Andrey Bregvadze, as the girl-ogling Colonel, dominated the stage with his rictus swagger of spur-clanking seduction technique. Even though the cast was full of young, hard-working soloists, their dancing lacked detail of style and expression. And as the programme continued and one historic showpiece after another was wheeled out, this lack of finesse began to matter. In the accumulating blur of heroic jumps and lifts, of pastel-draped fairies and sprites, there were, however, potentially memorable moments: the two leaping Pierrots in The Fairy Doll, the vertiginous one-handed lifts in Spring Waters, Ekaterina Borchenko's back-bending arabesque in Esmeralda. Yet these merged too rapidly into the generic tutu-ed solos of Paquita and the athletic brouhaha of Le Corsaire. It was all good, fizzing ballet fun, but less material here would certainly have counted for more."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
