They promised treatment to all Africans suffering from HIV/Aids by the end of the decade. Last week, at their summit in Germany, the leaders said they would get treatment to 5 million people with the disease, around half the total number of victims. They restated the 2005 aid pledge, a tacit acknowledgment that they had failed to honour their original commitment. It is easy to be sceptical. Poverty was not made history at Gleneagles. But that doesn't mean this year's meeting was failure. It was certainly not a 'farce', as Bob Geldof quickly labelled it. Mr Geldof is admirably tenacious as an anti-poverty campaigner. But his stadium-strutting hyperbole has limits. By denigrating what modest achievements were made, he reinforces the view that the G8 is only pretending to care about Africa, or climate change. That simply isn't true. Leaders of the industrialised world might only have grasped the importance of acting on those issues once they saw that it served their long-term interests, but that is still progress. They could easily have used their meeting to refine the trade arrangements between already rich countries based on strategies for prising open markets in poorer ones. They could have agreed that aid to developing nations should be conditional on the sale of state assets to foreign investors at knock-down prices. That, after all, is what they did through the IMF and World Bank for much of the 1990s. Seen from that perspective, it is remarkable how global aid issues have crossed over, in a few years, from protesters' placards on one side of the security cordon to the formal agenda of politicians on the other side. The Gleneagles meeting might have raised hopes that were unrealistic, but it changed the culture of G8 summitry for the better. Tony Blair deserves some credit for that. Credit is due also to German Chancellor Angela Merkel for forging something like consensus on climate change last week. At the start of the summit, George W Bush was hostile to Ms Merkel's ambitious targets for cutting carbon emissions and opposed to any future deal on the environment that would be run under UN auspices. Now, in principle at least, he has signed up for both. The hard work on global emissions cuts has yet to come. There is, for example, no clever deal in sight that will persuade developing countries, chiefly India, Brazil and China, to take a greener route as they try to catch up with the industrialised world. But a significant barrier - Mr Bush's phobia of anything that looked like the Kyoto protocol - has been removed. A different barrier to co-operation in the G8 stayed up: mutual suspicion between Russia and the West, especially over US plans for a European missile defence shield. But that problem was never going to be solved last week for historical reasons. The G7, as it was originally conceived, was a talking shop for leaders with economic power. Russia was only invited to join (making it G8) as compensation for its diminished status after the Cold War, making Russian insecurity, and reliance on its nuclear arsenal for leverage, a permanent fault line in the group. The G8 is not the right forum for strategic missile talks. Seen from the perspective of Gleneagles, and the high hopes of the anti-poverty campaign, last week's summit was a disappointment. But it is worth pausing for historical perspective, remembering how the world's economic power brokers used to do business. That longer view gives real grounds for optimism."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
