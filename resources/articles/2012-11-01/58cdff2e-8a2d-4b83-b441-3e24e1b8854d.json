The policies are largely in disarray, as is the department that is supposed to deliver them. First we saw Moira Wallace resign as the permanent secretary at the Department of Energy and Climate Change, insisting that her exit was nothing to do with the public spat between the green types and the Tory blues. Since then, the unfortunate department has had to bear the appointment of wind turbine-hating John Hayes as minister of state. And lately things have only got worse. Instead of appointing a permanent secretary to succeed Wallace, the system has installed mandarin Phil Wynn Owen, as an \"interim\". Why so? Because behind the scenes there is mounting unpleasantness. Permanent secretary appointments are usually masterminded by the head of the civil service, with ministers \u2013 including the PM \u2013 given a sniff of the shortlist late in the process. But this time Francis Maude, minister for the Cabinet Office, paymaster general, meddler extraordinaire, is insisting it's his shout, and has firmly told the head of the civil service, Sir Bob Kerslake, to stand aside. Onlookers report the language used has been unusually direct. Sir Bob's an easygoing guy but he's digging in \u2013 for what else does the head of the civil service do if not head the civil service? What Maude is supposed to be doing is anyone's guess. \u2022 Important news from Brussels, for the Cyprus EU presidency and the European Commission will be leading the European delegation in Doha, where the climate change summit begins next week. It's a top-level conference and there will be a top-level EU delegation: the German Karl-Heinz Florenz, rapporteur of parliament's temporary committee on climate change; another German, Peter Liese, who sits on the committee on the environment, public health and food safety; the former Spanish education minister, Pilar del Castillo; the Dane Dan J\u00f8rgensen, vice-chair of the committee on the environment, public health and food safety. And from Britain, Nick Griffin, BNP MEP for the North West. Makes you proud, doesn't it? \u2022 Yes, nasty Nick is down for Doha: the capital of Qatar, where 77.5% of the population are Muslim. Will he actually make the trip? And what would be his declaration as he arrives at customs. Might it be, as he has said, that Islam is a \"cancer\" and that \"we urgently need global chemotherapy against Islam to save civilisation\". Or his pronouncement of Islam as a \"wicked and vicious faith\". Fingers crossed that he upsets them at immigration. \u2022 But nothing is assured, for Nick is quite the traveller. Always welcome at dodgy rightwing rallies in mainland Europe. Always befriended at crackpot gatherings in the US, meeting such as David Duke of the Ku Klux Klan. And of course, he had the famous trip to Libya in 1986 to try to extract cash from Colonel Gadaffi. Nothing came of it. But Nick is quite the diplomat in his way. \u2022 To those who complain about the government's welfare changes \u2013 the infirm, the disabled \u2013 we convey a message from ministers: stop moaning and get a job. This one might suit. It's a brand new public affairs position. You'll lobby, connect, and help promote your company's activities. Deal with the fallout from the inevitable contretemps. This is, as the ad rightly says, \"a challenging role at an exciting time for the organisation, with a real opportunity to make a difference\". Who wouldn't want a chance to earn \u00a328,000 a year and jump the stick with controversy plagued, publicly ridiculed work-to-welfare specialists A4e. \u2022 Yes, get a job. And in fairness that must also apply to the miscreants featured yesterday; those who stole boxes containing 400 copies of the learned publication Education and Liberation \u2013 organ of the Socialist Teachers' Alliance. On discovering what they had stolen, the ne'er-do-wells brought the whole lot back again. This opening seems just the ticket. \"Our client,\" says recruiter Badenoch &amp; Clark, \"is seeking a Project Officer to join their thieving housing and regeneration team\". No references.
