England\u2019s coach is not shy about telling his team that he would regard failure to reach next Sunday\u2019s final as \u201cunacceptable\u201d as he demands collective bravery, both mental and physical, from a set of players schooled to view the term \u201crisk averse\u201d as taboo. \u201cThe only way for us to go back home is as winners,\u201d said Neville as he settled into the squad\u2019s new base in sweltering Lyon on Saturday afternoon. \u201cWe have to understand that losing in a semi-final is not OK. Defeat here on Tuesday would represent failure.\u201d Despite acknowledging that England may need to up their \u201cbravery levels\u201d by \u201caround 20%\u201d to see off Jill Ellis\u2019s defending world champions, he also worries about complacency on the part of a side who have reached the final four at the last three major tournaments. \u201cI think the FA know I\u2019m doing a good job,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve told the players it would be easy for them to think: \u2018Whatever happens, we\u2019ve got to the semi-final, my reputation\u2019s intact, we\u2019ll probably get invited to Downing Street, everybody loves us at home.\u2019 I don\u2019t want that. We have to develop that serial-winner mentality, that ruthlessness. I don\u2019t want us saying that there\u2019s no pressure on us. That\u2019s the safe way to think. We have to be even braver.\u201d Courage is at the root of Neville\u2019s ambitious pass-and-move philosophy and he recently invited Katherine Grainger to England\u2019s headquarters at St George\u2019s Park to explain the concept. Britain\u2019s most decorated female Olympian detailed the sacrifices required to transport her to the very top in rowing and, immediately before England\u2019s 3-0 quarter final win against Norway in Le Havre on Thursday, Grainger reiterated such sentiments in a special video message. \u201cThe girls were instantly inspired by a female athlete who had achieved so much,\u201d said Neville. \u201cI wanted them to hear Katherine\u2019s \u2018winning hurts\u2019 message again. \u201cShe told them: \u2018We have to suffer and exceed expectations. We have to trust in the pain we\u2019ve gone through and the sacrifices we\u2019ve made and accept it\u2019s going to hurt.\u2019 It had a more powerful effect than anything I could have said.\u201d If Neville\u2019s willingness to delegate is refreshing, Tuesday will be all about his personal battle of wits with the Portsmouth-born Ellis. Much could hinge on whether he can outmanoeuvre her. \u201cThe US know how to win,\u201d he said. \u201cAgainst France they went to five at the back early and then, when France were coming on strong at the end, they took the ball into the corner and managed the game out. They\u2019re the most ruthless team here but other sides are getting closer and, if we play our own game, we have a chance.\u201d Many managers would instinctively turn pragmatic but Neville maintains his possession-based mantra is \u201cnon-negotiable\u201d and compromise does not enter the equation. \u201cWe cannot change our style because we think they\u2019re a special case,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to be 20% braver than we\u2019ve ever been to win. If you waver, they\u2019ll punish you; they\u2019ve scored in the first 15 minutes of every game here. They\u2019ll want to throw the first punch. \u201cBut the US are the barometer of our progress. This is the game we wanted and I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll look forward to playing us,\u201d said Neville. \u201cThis is the moment my players have been waiting for.\u201d His Lionesses claim they want to be seen as \u201cbad-ass\u201d women but none of them is anywhere near as outspoken as Ellis\u2019s social justice activist Megan Rapinoe, aka Donald Trump\u2019s b\u00eate noire and the scorer of both goals in the 2-1 win against France. \u201cSome people can talk the talk but don\u2019t deliver \u2013 but not Rapinoe,\u201d said Neville, who will take charge of the GB team at the Tokyo Olympics next year. \u201cBut their whole team\u2019s not scared of putting their heads above the parapet. They\u2019re fighting for equality within their own organisation. And the way Rapinoe campaigns for equal rights and speaks out against homophobia and racial discrimination says a lot about her. \u201cI was always taught to stand up for what I believed in and I admire her.\u201d Neville is also a confirmed sun worshipper but even he acknowledges temperatures that hit 38C (100.4F) in Lyon on Saturday present a problem. At least by Tuesday\u2019s 9pm kick-off in France it is expected to have cooled to about 27C. \u201cIt\u2019s still going to be hot,\u201d said Neville. \u201cBut we\u2019ve reached the moment where we have to deliver.\u201d The two semi-fiinalists last met in the World Cup in 2007 when the USA cruised to a 3-0 quarter-final win in China. They are rather more closely matched now, though, as illustrated by the 2-2 draw they played out in their last meeting, at the SheBelieves Cup in March. England\u2019s goals came from Steph Houghton and Nikita Parris as they came from a goal down to lead 2-1. And it was the Lionesses who ended up winning the four-team invitational tournament."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
