In \"Time to account for travel maps' costs\" (June 22), we wrote: \"For a charity to put [those maps] on a webserver that might be used by hundreds of people (a typical server can handle 2,000) would cost millions of pounds annually.\" In fact, Ordnance Survey points out, the cost would be more like \u00a318,000 per year - a hundredfold less than we suggested. The error (which was ours) arose when we followed up on a query made by mySociety, the charitable organisation that demonstrates beneficial use of public information online. It had asked OS how much it would cost to display its \"time travel\" maps, which show how long it takes to travel to parts of the country from different starting points. The response: a single-user, internal licence would cost roughly \u00a31,000 per year (excluding VAT) for \"internal business use, display and promotion as long as there is no financial gain\". So how much more expensive would it be for a web service, where you would potentially have thousands of people - in effect, \"users\" - accessing the data? Wouldn't you have to multiply the single-user cost by a factor of a thousand? But Ed Parsons, OS's chief technology officer, said that was wrong. To the OS, all web users count as \"one user\", as long as the original data being manipulated remains behind an organisation's firewall, a condition of the licence. But the confusion is understandable. OS's page on copyright licensing for internet use (at http://tinyurl.com/kyxuu) does not specify that internet users en masse only count as one; hence mySociety's expectation that internet use would lead to an explosion in costs. Not so, said OS. For a single scale mapping of the country - say, at 1:50,000 scale - including Code Point for finding postcodes (so you can get a map of a postcode's location), the annual licence for a website serving 20,000 map images per day, every day, would be \u00a318,200 per year. To provide the mapping service most web users are used to, one would have to license several scales: we have grown used to being able to zoom in on a point. Streetmap offers seven mapping scales; Multimap offers 13, though not all appear to come from OS. Using multiple scales will, of course, ramp up costs very quickly - as will being popular. But even licensing seven scales will only take your annual costs to around \u00a3100,000 - not into the millions. Unless, of course, you are wildly successful. Tom Steinberg, mySociety's director, says: \"The price for these maps, which cover only a small chunk of the country, is way above affordability by most small and medium-sized enterprises, a group that employs more than half the UK workforce. Furthermore, it excludes the entire caste of internet-based enthusiasts who've produced about 80% of all the innovative mapping work in the world over the past couple of years.\" We agree. We don't think there should be any charge for using OS's map data online. But to find out it's lower than we thought is certainly a pleasant surprise. \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
