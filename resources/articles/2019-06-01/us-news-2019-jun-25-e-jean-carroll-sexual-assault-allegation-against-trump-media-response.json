Pretty big news story, you might think. Not so in the US, it seems. When the news broke last Friday that E Jean Carroll, a revered advice columnist, had accused Donald Trump of sexually attacking her in late 1995 or early 1996, alleging he slammed her against a wall inside a dressing room in the Bergdorf Goodman store in New York then penetrated her without consent, the response from many top media titles was strangely restrained. The president himself has denied the claims, saying: \u201cI\u2019ll say it with great respect: number one, she\u2019s not my type; number two, it never happened.\u201d However, for a variety of reasons \u2013 some apparently blatantly political, some technical, some as yet unexplained \u2013 news outlets decided to downplay the story or even excise it altogether. The most startling example was at the New York Post, where the tabloid ran an account of Carroll\u2019s allegations drawn from an extract from her new book published by New York magazine, only to take the story down a few hours later. Oliver Darcy, the eagle-eyed senior media correspondent of CNN, spotted that not only did the Post\u2019s own story on the alleged assault vanish but so too did Associated Press copy on the same issue published by the Post. Darcy later reported that Col Allan, the Post\u2019s pugnacious former editor who is now an \u201cadviser\u201d to the newspaper, had made the call to pull the stories. As Darcy and his CNN colleague Marianne Garvey pointed out, Allan is a firm Trump supporter who was photographed during the 2016 presidential race sporting a Make America Great Again hat in the Post newsroom. Allan was given an oversight role at the tabloid by his boss, Rupert Murdoch, another keen Trump admirer. That a major newspaper should apparently suppress for political reasons a story about a sitting US president facing allegations of a sex crime was shocking enough. But some observers were even more dismayed by the generally low-energy (to use a Trumpism) approach displayed by a raft of less partisan outlets in both print and television. The question of Trump\u2019s sexual conduct was hardly raised among the flagship Sunday political talk shows, though MSNBC and CNN did call Carroll in for on-camera interviews within their normal run of scheduling. On the print side, Media Matters highlighted the absence or relative diminution of the charges on the Saturday front pages of many of the most august newspapers in the country, including the New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Chicago Tribune and others. The most peculiar editorial decision was that of the Times to locate the story on its books pages (a nod at What Do We Need Men For?, Carroll\u2019s forthcoming book in which she lays out the allegations). Quizzed by the paper\u2019s readers\u2019 editor on this peculiar placement, executive editor Dean Baquet conceded \u201cwe were overly cautious\u201d and said the basic details of the story \u201cshould\u2019ve compelled us to play it bigger\u201d. Baquet went on to say that in retrospect guidelines laid down for #MeToo reporting of sexual assault allegations relating to the New York Times\u2019s own investigations of Harvey Weinstein and others had been misapplied to a major statement by a well-known individual made in a different media outlet. But whatever the finer details of the editorial choices made by top newspaper and TV outlets, the collective appearance of lack of enthusiasm for the story left many observers rattled. \u201cThis is extremely worrying and I really can\u2019t understand how we ended up here,\u201d Barbara Davis, a best-selling women\u2019s fiction writer, told the Guardian. \u201cWe seem to be experiencing in the entire country a desensitization towards cruelty, lawlessness and bad behavior \u2013 we are becoming numb when we should be taking to the streets.\u201d Trump has repeatedly and vociferously denied that he assaulted Carroll, stating that he has never even met her though a photograph of them together in a social setting has resurfaced. More than 20 women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct. Carroll is the second to allege an attack amounting to rape, the first having been his former wife Ivana Trump who is reported to have made the rape claim in a sworn divorce deposition though she later backtracked and said she had not used the word in a \u201cliteral or criminal sense\u201d. Trump has admitted to sexual misconduct. He was recorded in the notorious Access Hollywood tape, released shortly before the 2016 election, bragging about forcibly kissing women and using his celebrity power to \u201cgrab \u2019em by the pussy\u201d. That he was caught expressing such repugnant attitudes towards women yet went on within weeks to win the presidency is a sign of Trump\u2019s singular ability to survive revelations that have floored many other men in the #MeToo era. The events of the past few days will only increase speculation around the media\u2019s role in affording him a metaphorical \u2013 and perhaps even literal \u2013 get out of jail pass."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
