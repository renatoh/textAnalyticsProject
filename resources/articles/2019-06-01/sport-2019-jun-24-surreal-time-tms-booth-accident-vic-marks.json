I first appeared on the programme in Delhi on 17 December 1984 as an emergency replacement. England were playing the second Test against India and, as ever, I was in the touring party but not in the team. On the fifth day the match was bubbling up nicely. India collapsed dramatically in their second innings, leaving England with a modest victory target of 125 and an unexpected chance to level the series on the final afternoon. It was at this point that Peter Baxter, the producer of TMS, popped his head into the England dressing room. In those days \u2013 and on that tour in particular \u2013 it was still possible for a member of the media to be welcomed into the dressing room during a match. I was there alongside our assistant manager, Norman Gifford, who had just filled his pipe in anticipation of the climax of the Test (another thing that would not be possible today). \u201cI need a summariser now,\u201d said Baxter. \u201cAnyone will do.\u201d So I happily volunteered. Three of us in the England squad must have made an impression on Baxter on that tour, possibly the last one when the media and the players were happily living in one another\u2019s pockets: Graeme Fowler, who hit a double century in Madras; Jonathan Agnew, who came out in the middle of the tour as a replacement for the injured Paul Allott, and me. We would all spend many happy hours in Baxter\u2019s commentary boxes in the years to come. Apart from those rare occasions when the connection was down or his commentators had not turned up on time, \u201cBartex\u201d, as he was known, oversaw a most relaxed and civilised commentary box. Requests to work on TMS sounded more like an invitation to supper. \u201cWould you care to join us at Trent Bridge?\u201d No one declined. Why would you unless far more lucrative offers came from the TV broadcasters? I had listened to the programme as a kid when Brian Johnston and John Arlott were in their pomp.When I reappeared on TMS in 1990 Johnston was the kingpin. It was odd to find myself sitting alongside a man whose commentaries I had heard when wearing shorts on the farm. The bonhomie was almost overwhelming. I was welcomed into the box by Johnston as a long-lost friend, albeit a young one, even though I had barely met him before. Alongside him I might find Bill Frindall, Fred Trueman and Trevor Bailey plus the more familiar Christopher Martin-Jenkins. This was surreal. For years Trueman and Bailey had been the constant summarisers yet neither seemed to resent the arrival of newcomers, which impressed me then and even more now. I\u2019m doing my best to be equally sanguine at the appearance of so many young, gifted broadcasters in the box. By the end Fred was happy to parody himself with an \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going off out there\u201d, and sometimes he was all too easily prodded by his commentator. Neville Oliver from Australia was especially adept at winding him up. Neville would wait until the last minute of his stint before singing the praises of, say, Darren Gough, tossing out the notion that he must be the fastest bowler England have produced since ... then there would be a little pause ... Harold Larwood perhaps or Frank Tyson? Neville would then hand over to the next commentator with Fred swallowing his pipe (metaphorical or real) before launching a counterblast to such a ridiculous suggestion. The new commentator was left to pick up the pieces. Bartex did not overwhelm a new recruit with an avalanche of advice and it was a very rare occasion when he said anything into your earphones when on air. He wanted his broadcasters to be relaxed and his summarisers to engage in an easy conversation with the commentators. So he trusted them to get on with it. It was an excellent formula and one that Adam Mountford, his successor, has tried to maintain (and it is fair to say that Geoffrey Boycott, for example, does not invite too much production). TMS works better when it is off the cuff and sounds as if it is coming from a country pub rather than a pulpit or a comedy club. It is a simple enough operation. The commentator is the one at the helm. He \u2013 or she (I was lucky enough to be alongside Donna Symonds from Barbados when she became TMS\u2019s first female commentator on the Caribbean tour of 1997-98) \u2013 describes the action, leads the conversation and is in charge of proceedings. This requires real expertise, which includes the ability to listen to instructions in your ear while saying something comprehensible with your tongue. The commentator is the one who requires the broadcasting skills. However, some attributes are required to be a summariser. The most difficult, although this is not written in any statute book anywhere, is that you probably need to have represented your country to get regular work. It also helps to have been a contestant on Strictly Come Dancing. If you can achieve one or both of those goals then everything else is a doddle. In fact, the trickiest task for any summariser is to know when to keep quiet. That sounds simple enough but how many sporting broadcasters are there who have not been enamoured by the sound of their own voice? In cricket Richie Benaud, Tony Cozier, Agnew and Simon Mann might be exceptions while my recollection of a distant Dan Maskell at Wimbledon is that he only ever said, \u201cOoh, I say.\u201d The golden rule is to shut up when the bowler is running in. It does not matter whether you are in the middle of some incredibly illuminating insight or a hilariously funny joke you have to stop, sometimes in mid-sentence, and let the commentator describe the action. After all that is the purpose of radio commentary; first and foremost the listeners have to know exactly what\u2019s happening out there \u2013 and they quite like to know the score as well. There are other times when it is best to keep quiet or risk the ire of your commentator. At landmark moments \u2013 when a boundary delivers a century, at the fall of a vital wicket and most certainly at the end of the game \u2013 it is best to be quiet. Those clips played on the news bulletins sound better to the rest of the world \u2013 and the commentator \u2013 without interruptions from the \u201cexpert\u201d. I learned to acclimatise to the different approaches of the various commentators. Johnston might easily commentate through the entire over without interruption if nothing startling had happened. He might finish with a score and then he would pause in anticipation of his summariser making his contribution before the start of the next over. The patterns of Henry Blofeld were harder to predict except for the advent of pigeons, cranes and buses, many of them \u201cpensive\u201d, but he would often operate in a similar manner. At the opposite end of the scale is Agnew, whose style has always been conversational, and the same applies with Mann. They describe the action and there is always some interplay between commentator and summariser. It is tempting to regard this as \u201cthe modern way\u201d but both have been doing their jobs for well over two decades. The wondrous trio of CMJ, Tony Cozier and Jim Maxwell could do it either way. It was a privilege just to sail along in their wake. What a box of broadcasters they made. Soon after his appointment as BBC cricket correspondent it became apparent that Jonathan had the capacity to make any guest \u2013 or summariser \u2013 relaxed at the microphone. I still look forward to him taking the seat next to me. When he conducts his interviews he is interested in his guests and has the vital capacity to listen to them and have a conversation rather than spout a string of predetermined questions. The guests are soon comfortable and are therefore more interesting and, in certain instances, likelier to reveal a bit more than intended. Quite often I\u2019m asked who has been my favourite commentator. Well, it\u2019s a tricky question that has to be sidestepped somehow because I have never wanted to upset Jonathan, CMJ, Blowers or Simon Mann by choosing just one of them. So my usual response (unless I\u2019m in Australia when I naturally mention the marvellous Jim Maxwell) is to say \u201cTony Cozier\u201d. This may be another of my convenient compromises, but it is also true. Cozier would have played against Frank Worrell, Garry Sobers, Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith at club level in Barbados, where he opened the batting for Wanderers, a club he joined after resigning from Carlton CC when they had rejected a potential black member. \u201cA lot of them were my age and I virtually became part of the team,\u201d he once recalled. Tony was recognised by cricket followers all around the world more by his voice than his appearance. A surprising number of devotees did not realise that he was a white Bajan \u2013 a native of Barbados \u2013 yet all were captivated by the unmistakable lilting tones of his commentary, and they trusted his clear and forthright analysis of West Indies cricket through thick and thin. It was always a delight to sit alongside him.
