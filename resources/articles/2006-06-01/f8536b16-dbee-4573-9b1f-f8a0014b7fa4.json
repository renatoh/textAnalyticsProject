I've been here since early January and since I've been here we haven't been paid according to our contracts. The contract looks quite ordinary - \"equal monthly instalments, after deductions, by direct credit transfer to bank/building society on or before last working day of each month\". For January and February we were paid, late, by cheque. March was a \u00a3500 cheque each (accompanied by a payslip with our full wages on it) on March 31 then the balance on April 25 ! This month we were \"promised\" our full wages on Tuesday, May 2. Nothing has materialised. The boss mutters and mumbles about securing sponsorship. He will sub us bits here and there but that's not good enough. I have rent to pay and am living on cereal. Of course, I am looking for alternative employment and am feeling stupid for allowing myself to be hit over the head by this crappy company over and over again, but - this job should be great for me. I suppose I am asking what we can do about this situation immediately while I look for another job and/or the company gets the sponsorship and everything is OK. Thanks for any advice and while I fully expect you to say GET OUT NOW STUPID I just hope I can afford the paper on Saturday to read it. As you've surely realised, there are only two possible explanations for your boss's behaviour: one all-too probable and the other not. The improbable explanation is this: he's perfectly solvent but is mean to the point of dishonesty. He's seeing just how much he can get away with. But if he really thought he could get away with all this in the long run, he'd have to be deranged as well. The overwhelming probability, of course, is that like so many startups he was under-capitalised from the start. He's now exhausted his agreed facility with the bank and the dribs and drabs he's paying you all come straight out of earnings. And I can't say I find this talk of impending sponsorship at all reassuring; it's not a common source of working capital. For a startup to run out of money is not always terminal. Your company's underlying business could be perfectly healthy, but if their clients are slow payers - and there are a lot of them about - that could in itself have precipitated this temporary trouble. So, if you really like this job, and in every other respect feel it's a quality company, you should hang on in there. One thing makes me hesitate, however. If it really is no more than a shortage of capital - if the order book is good and growing, the costs are under control and the margins seem adequate - then all that evidence could be produced. And after taking a beady look, and satisfying themselves that the business plan still made sense, most banks and venture capitalists would be prepared to extend their facility: it's a better bet than losing their initial investment completely. This makes me suspect that your boss may have already tried this route and failed. None of this, of course, offers you the slightest immediate help, and I'm sorry about that. Everything depends on those underlying figures and there's no legitimate way you can gain access to them. So, you should certainly ratchet up your efforts to find another job - but I don't think you're in the least bit stupid to stay with the one that you've got for as long as you can bear to go on living on cereal. I am passionate about selling but don't know the right route to take I am looking for a job in sales and I am totally confused. Since graduating four years ago, I've held a number of sales jobs but never for long as I've either been working with the wrong people or have been given a telesales role (not what I want). I understand you may ask why I've left my jobs, and whether it's me just not getting on with others. All I can say is that I haven't liked any of my jobs, but I really do believe there's a sales job out there that I would love. I have strong sales skills and will excel at selling given the right working environment. What do you suggest for someone passionate about selling and developing business, but who doesn't know which route to take? One of the dominant characteristics of great salespeople is a relentless optimism. Many years ago, the Parker Pen Company used to issue its salesmen with a monthly newsletter that carried a regular feature called something like Salesmen's Sayings. Here is one of them: \"Remember! The only difference between a stumbling block and a stepping stone is the way you look upon it!\" There speaks the true, my-glass-is-not-half-empty-it's-half-full salesperson. You don't seem to be one of them. I can understand your aversion to telesales and I don't blame you for wanting something more fulfilling. But you do seem to be a bit picky for the sort of committed salesman you claim to be. You've either been working with \"the wrong people\" or not in \"the right environment\". Too many stumbling blocks and not enough stepping stones; and always somebody else's fault. Four years is a long time. My very strong suspicion is this (and it's true for a lot of excellent sales people): you need to be passionate not just about selling things; you also need to be passionate about the things that you're selling. You must have some obsessive interest, something you bore your friends about: real ale, old books, new clubs, property conversions, proportional representation, lion dung, garden gnomes, squash clubs, aromatherapy. Forget the immediate salary: look for a job selling things that interest you a great deal and about which you're already knowledgeable. The chances are you'll find yourself working with a bunch of congenial, compatible people and having - at long last - a thoroughly satisfactory focus for your selling skills. \u00b7 Jeremy Bullmore writes a column for Management Today, in which some of these questions first appeared.
