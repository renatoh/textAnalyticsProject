He spent Thursday in another must-win seat, Macarthur. It was already the prime minister\u2019s third visit to the region in campaign 2016. As in every election of the past two decades, western Sydney is talismanic. Partly this is down to numbers: a dozen seats comprise an area roughly six times the size of Greater London and home to one in 10 Australians. Seven are marginal and at least three \u2013 Lindsay, Macarthur and Macquarie, all held by the Liberals \u2013 are seriously in play on 2 July. The region\u2019s residents are, in the words of Centre for Western Sydney director Phillip O\u2019Neill, \u201cballot pencil assassins\u201d. But western Sydney occupies a symbolic place too, where political and media elites \u2013 Mark Latham chief among them \u2013 imagine \u201creal Australia\u201d lies. That belief has served as a warning for Labor since swaths of its base deserted the Keating government for John Howard in 1996. \u201cHoward\u2019s battlers\u201d helped entrench the Liberals in government for 11 years. Seats such as Macarthur have never returned to Labor hands. Whether Turnbull can appeal to these same voters is one of the great unknowns of election 2016. \u201cHe\u2019s polished,\u201d says Litsa, a Campbelltown small businesswoman. \u201cIs he different from the usual politician? Probably not.\u201d Joe, a Campbelltown tow-truck driver, is also cynical. \u201cI haven\u2019t followed politics since Mr Howard, because everything was perfect then as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d he says. \u201cHe stopped the boats, had plenty of money in the bank.\u201d The 73-year-old is less sold on Turnbull: \u201cHe\u2019s not much different from Labor.\u201d On the verge of retirement, he is spooked \u2013 perhaps needlessly \u2013 by plans to close a superannuation tax loophole. (\u201cMy accountant says, no, it won\u2019t worry you. Not enough money, he reckons.\u201d) Last week at the Penrith regional gallery the prime minister moved easily through a morning tea of small businesswomen and young mothers, telling one: \u201cEverything we\u2019re doing is aimed at supporting you.\u201d But a deeper connection to the region may elude him. Though every political figure is, to some extent, removed from middle Australian reality, Howard at least projected a suburban commonness. Both men are members of Sydney\u2019s exclusive, male-only Australian Club, but Turnbull looks it. Last week\u2019s visit to western Sydney ended poorly, a planned walk to meet voters at Westfield cancelled after an acrimonious media conference. The prime minister described by Tony Abbott\u2019s former chief of staff, Peta Credlin, as \u201cMr Harbourside Mansion\u201d beat a retreat to central Sydney, the Daily Telegraph told its readers in its report of the campaign stop. A Galaxy poll in the same newspaper on Monday found Liberal support holding in key seats such as Lindsay and Macarthur, but broad agreement that Labor\u2019s Bill Shorten would be better for western Sydney. Popular discourse lumps the area together, but the electorates of Sydney\u2019s outer west are \u201cincredibly diverse\u201d, says Professor James Arvanitakis, a sociologist at Western Sydney University. Smith is the most common surname in Penrith, one part of Lindsay. In Blacktown, part of the neighbouring electorate of Chifley, it\u2019s Singh. Similarly, Arvanitakis says, \u201cyou\u2019ve got streets in Parramatta that are really wealthy and then pockets of extreme disadvantage in places like Macquarie Fields\u201d. Policies for the region are too \u201coften talked about in this holistic way\u201d, he says. \u201cBut in reality, a rail link in Parramatta means nothing to people in Bankstown, waiting an hour for the bus. It\u2019s an incredibly multicultural region that has extremes of wealth and poverty.\u201d That said, catering for a population growing faster than anywhere in the country \u2013 expected to swell to three million by 2036 \u2013 is a region-wide challenge. New resident numbers significantly outstrip new jobs, and more than 416,000 people will be commuting to work from the area within two decades. WSU researchers warn that will \u201cput enormous pressure on economic productivity [with] highly significant negative impacts on family life, and on residents\u2019 health and living conditions\u201d. In response, the federal and state governments are spending $3.6bn to build and upgrade roads to the region, and have committed to building a second airport at Badgerys Creek by 2026. Turnbull also used a March trip to Parramatta to talk up the \u201c30-minute city\u201d, a modish design concept where residents work, learn and socialise within a short commute of their homes. But the fast-rail link that could realise his vision was at least three decades away, he said. That\u2019s little help to Fiona Scott, defending a 3% margin in Lindsay, nor in the Liberals\u2019 less prominent but more vulnerable seats. Labor once needed an 11% swing to claim Macarthur in the south-west, but successive electoral boundary changes have that margin down to 3.3%. \u201cThe strong Liberal heartland of Macarthur has been cut out,\u201d election analyst Ben Raue says. Both Bill Shorten and Turnbull visited the seat this week, each promising $50m to upgrade Appin Road, a major and much-neglected artery. Macquarie (4.5% margin), in the north-west, is a pairing of the safely Liberal Hawkesbury region with the strongly Labor Blue Mountains. But strong opposition to the Baird government plans to amalgamate Hawkesbury\u2019s council \u2013 now dropped \u2013 may give Labor\u2019s Susan Templeman the edge over incumbent Louise Markus. A Teachers\u2019 Federation-commissioned poll in April put the major parties at 50-50 in Macquarie, but suggested a failure to adhere to the Gonski funding model \u2013 confirmed in the May budget \u2013 could cost the Liberals the seat. At less risk this time are marginal Labor seats such as Greenway (3% margin) \u2013 held against the odds in 2013 by the popular Michelle Rowland \u2013 or Parramatta (1.6%), where the Liberals only this month selected a candidate. \u201cThe Liberals won\u2019t be trying to win seats as much as hold them,\u201d Raue says. Whatever the result, few MPs in the region can look forward to long-term job stability. As its population and economy transform, western Sydney\u2019s marginals will stay volatile. But Arvanitakis sees another factor at work, too. \u201cWestern Sydney is a reflection of the electorate across Australia, where we\u2019ve gone away from dyed-in-the-wool Labor and Liberal voters, to picking and choosing,\u201d he says. People don\u2019t join parties any more, but nor do they join churches or clubs. Voting has become, like so much else, \u201ca retail experience\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 23 May 2016 to correct the name of the Centre for Western Sydney director to Phillip O\u2019Neill."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
