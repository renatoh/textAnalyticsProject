This despite a new statement from the senate intelligence committee ... Read US national security editor Spencer Ackerman\u2019s coverage Based on the information available to us, we see no indications that Trump Tower was the subject of surveillance by any element of the United States government either before or after Election Day 2016. \u2013 Republican Richard Burr and Democrat Mark Warner, heads of the Senate intelligence committee Trump \u201cdidn\u2019t mean specifically wiretapping\u201d, Spicer said, but surveillance more generally. The charge not only directly contradicts Senate investigators \u2013 it amounts to an accusation that Obama and the security services had committed a felony. The White House released what it said was a budget outline. In fact it was an extremely brief document that mentioned a lot of new money for defense ($52bn), eliminated funds for key anti-poverty programs and didn\u2019t address revenue or entitlement spending at all. Arts funding on chopping block Programs facing cuts under Trump\u2019s budget, which would have to pass Congress to take effect, included legal services for victims of domestic violence, food vouchers for single mothers, and the Meals for Wheels program for needy seniors. The budget chops EPA funding too. Legal services on chopping block Can we really continue to ask a coal miner in West Virginia or a single mom in Detroit to pay for these programs? And the answer is no. We can ask them to pay for defense, and we will. But we can\u2019t ask them to continue to pay for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. \u2013 Budget director Mick Mulvaney"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
