The last frame of their opening session was significant. Selby, right, won it from 0-60 with a 73 clearance to lead 6-3 overnight, made a 127 break in yesterday's opening frame and improved to 8-4 before Walden showed his quality with a run of 100. Selby, though, put himself four up with five to play with 117 and seized victory two frames later with his third century of the afternoon, 101.
