Growth in the housing market has weakened in the past three years as extended political uncertainty has weighed on prices, particularly in London and south-east England, where Berkeley specialises. Berkeley warned that margins would be squeezed this year by continued Brexit uncertainty and said it was \u201cnaturally cautious in this period of extended political and economic volatility\u201d. Profits for the year to the end of April were \u00a3775m, down from \u00a3977m in the previous 12 months, although that was higher than analysts had expected. Berkeley expects profits to fall by a further third in the 2019-20 financial year, leaving them only about half the level of 2017-18. The company, which employs about 11,000 people, completed 3,698 homes during the year in London and the south-east, including more than 10% of London\u2019s new private homes. House prices in London fell by 1.2% in the year to April, according to data from the Office for National Statistics released on Wednesday. It was the lowest rate in the country. The average house price across the UK rose 1.4% to \u00a3229,000, compared with an annual growth rate of 1.6% in March \u2013 continuing the slowdown of the last three years, mainly driven by the south and east of England, the ONS said. Berkeley\u2019s average selling price rose by 3% year on year in the 12 months to April, to \u00a3748,000. However, the group has started to look beyond the capital in search of growth. Eight of 11 new developments launched in the past year were outside Greater London, including sites in the home counties in locations such as Winchester, Cranleigh and Fleet, as well as one in Birmingham. Tony Pidgley, who founded Berkeley in 1976, said the company had produced a \u201csolid performance\u201d. Berkeley bought 14 sites during the year, which analysts at the stockbroker Peel Hunt, led by Clyde Lewis, said was a \u201cclear indication that [Berkeley] is once again seeing value in land\u201d. Berkeley, which is sitting on a cash pile of almost \u00a31bn, continued to return cash to shareholders, paying out \u00a3252m in share buybacks and dividends during the year. It plans to give shareholders another \u00a3140m by 30 September, alongside a dividend to be announced in August. Housebuilders\u2019 profits have been supported by the help-to-buy scheme, the government subsidy that provides financial support to first-time homebuyers. Many independent economists believe the scheme has acted to inflate house prices \u2013 and consequently builders\u2019 profits. Analysis by the investment platform AJ Bell in March found that Britain\u2019s biggest housebuilders had paid out \u00a32.3bn in dividends in their most recent financial year, in part thanks to the scheme."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
