Who can cope with relentless exposure to all that we are able to know so easily about the world today? We ration our exposure to violence, to grief, to war, to disease and to starvation. We come to despair of solutions. We graduate our tolerance. And so it is that we shut our minds to what is going on today within and around the borders of Israel. Of course, we cannot isolate ourselves completely. Some murders are so horrible they sneak in beneath radar. We still - at least - notice the violent deaths of children. The use of warplanes on civilian areas still has the capacity to shock. But, by and large, we cannot deal with the enormity of the unfolding tragedy. A fortnight of murder, bombs, bulldozers, maiming, rockets and torture - never mind the ever-present poverty and systematic infringement of human rights - all this passes with a despairing shrug. The abnormal becomes normal. The extraordinary becomes not only expected but accepted. This tragedy affects all who live within the borders of Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA). It is a tragedy for beleaguered Palestinian refugees - overwhelmingly innocent of any violence - whose daily lives are little more than a soul-sapping test of endurance. It is a tragedy for those families on either side of the divide directly marked by the continual violence. But it is also a tragedy for Israel itself. The men and women who created Israel wanted it to be a country based on freedom, justice and peace: in May 1948 they promised to ensure \"complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex\". Those intentions were noble, the realisation fraught. But more than 50 years later, we are forced to confront some uncomfortable truths about how the dream of a sanctuary for the Jewish people in the very land in which their spiritual, religious and political identity was shaped has come to be poisoned. The establishment of this sanctuary has been bought at a very high cost in human rights and human lives. It must be apparent that the international community cannot support this cost indefinitely. Israeli Jews are, for easily understood reasons, least able to bear these realities. Prof Stanley Cohen - an eminent sociologist who has a perspective gained from having lived in South Africa, England and Israel - writes in his recent book: \"Denial of the injustices and injuries inflicted upon the Palestinians is built into the social fabric... There are, of course, good historical reasons why Israeli Jews should have a defensive self-image and a character armour of insecurity and permanent victimhood. The result is a xenophobia that would be called 'racism' anywhere else, an exclusion of Palestinians from a shared moral universe and an obsessional self-absorption: what we do to them is less important than what this does to us.\" The \"what this does to us\" was nicely summarised by one Israeli novelist recently in the sentence: \"What should have been heaven has become a form of hell.\" A visitor to Israel today who takes the trouble to visit both the cosmopolitan and historic centres of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem as well as the captive degradation of the Gaza Strip cannot but think of the rottenest days of South Africa. The analogy soon falters - South Africa was always one society with a single future while this is the story of two societies sharing the same space and seeking separate (though one day entwined) futures. But the parallels between the two states should be troubling enough for any Jew with a sense of the historical necessity for the creation of the state of Israel. The Israeli novelist, Amos Oz, used to use the fable of the plank and the drowning man to explain the justness of Zionism. A drowning man (he wrote) is allowed, under all rules of natural justice, to cling to any piece of driftwood even if in doing so he is obliged to push others aside a little. He may even use force. But he has no right to push the others into the sea. The Palestinians have not quite been pushed into the sea, but Israel's share of the plank - and the methods it uses to keep it - are harder and harder to justify. Few can feel comfortable about the disparity in land, living conditions and power between the two peoples whom the international community intended should co-exist as independent states. Israel controls 20,700 square kilometers and 6m people against the 1,500 kilometers and 2.9m people under the control of the Palestinians. The average personal income of an Israeli is $17,000: for a Palestinian, $1,350. Israel's GNP is $100bn, the Palestinians' $4bn (half of which comes from outside the Palestinian areas, including Israel). The regular Israeli army is 195,000-strong against Palestinian forces of 35,000. One army can summon up American-built F-16s, the other has rifles. In the current uprising the number of Palestinian dead and injured outnumbers the Israeli casualties by five to one; 17 Palestinian children have died for every Israeli child. It is true that the Arab states have never used their vast wealth to improve the lots of Gaza, but the conditions in which a vast number of Palestinians live today in Gaza should nevertheless be unthinkable in any civilised and humane society. More than a million Palestinians - including 818,000 refugees - are penned into a small strip of land with population densities and conditions which match anything in the apartheid townships of South Africa. Without Israel there is no sustainable life or economy. The borders have been subject to closure for much of the last 10 years: at the moment few Palestinians can leave, even to work. The current unemployment rate is as high as 45%. No goods can leave or enter except via Israeli customs. Though the area of land is nominally under the control of the PA, internal movement within Gaza is effectively controlled by Israel, which regularly rations water, bulldozes houses and destroys arable land. The reality is that Israel controls the time and space of every Palestinian living within the area. And then there are the settlements which defiantly squat within this huddled space the size of the Isle of Wight. At most, 6,500 Jewish settlers occupy as much as 20% of this land - nearly 35% if you include the security installations protecting them. There may be nuanced ar guments about the legality or necessity of some of the 150-odd settlements in the West Bank and around Jerusalem. It is difficult to see the settlements within Gaza as anything other than an obscene stain on Israel's honour. It is further difficult to see the treatment of the Palestinian population as a whole as anything other than an indefensible form of collective punishment for the deeds of the few. Israel argues, of course, that it could afford to build far more positive bridges without these few and without their deeds - and if there were no corruption within the PA and a more engaged and constructive Palestinian leadership. All this is true. Israel also has perfectly justifiable fears about its geography. DJ Schneeweiss of the Israeli Embassy in London wrote to this paper last week: \"The Arab world is rampant with vicious anti-Semitic and anti-Zionist incitement, coupled with the absence of liberal traditions and religious tolerance.\" There is much truth in this, too. No peace will be possible unless Israel's neighbours can unequivocally acknowledge the moral necessity of Israel's existence. It is a measure of the desperation of the current situation that this should even need articulation. But amidst this unremitting bleakness there are some faint rays of hope. Here are some: \u0095 A gradual recognition among the Israeli population that the 73-year-old soldier they voted into power only three months months ago is bankrupt of any ideas about settling this problem beyond the bulldozer, the tank, the sniper and now the rocket. A coruscating editorial in Israel's biggest-selling, politically mainstream Hebrew daily, Yediot Aharonot, said last week: \"Only a revenge-seeking fool could believe that eliminations and missile fire, the demolition of neighbourhoods, the killing of soldiers and civilians and the destruction of homes could restore personal calm and security. Many politicians on both the left and the right already know that the use of ruthless force has no purpose, and that we are galloping toward disaster.\" \u0095 A growing appreciation that - though the discussions at Camp David and Taba imploded amid much mutual recrimination - the two sides were not a million miles apart. There had been much agreement on the issue of territory and over the division and/or control of Jerusalem. If all else were equal the Palestinian demand for a Right of Return might be settled as a question of modalities. No one is pretending that there is any immediate prospect of returning to the state of negotiations so delicately poised before their violent collapse. But there is a mature recognition that the talks failed for a number of complex reasons - many of them procedural - and not simply from the impossibility of agreement. \u0095 The involvement of Senator George Mitchell, whose calming influence is as reassuring as it was in Ireland. His proposal for an immediate freezing of settlements in exchange for a cessation of Palestinian violence is such basic common sense it is baffling why anyone should argue with it. But a freeze is a freeze is a freeze. No \"natural growth\" of settlements to reflect the 2.3% increase in the population of Israel. No filling up of existing settlements. Just a freeze. \u0095 The recent work of the \"new\" historians such as Benny Morris and Avi Shlaim who have dug deep into the Israeli archives in order to write fiercely honest accounts of Israel's behaviour towards the Palestinians from the 1940s onwards. This has yet to be mirrored by a similar openness by Palestinian historians, but it has helped begin a process by which ordinary Israelis can come to terms with the injustices done in the process of their country's just creation. It has helped kickstart the movement to acknowledge that there are two different historical narratives, both of which need mutual recognition before any resolution can be achieved. \u0095 Signs that the European Union may take a more active part in bringing its influence to bear on the region. America has historically played this role, but the $3bn-plus annual contribution it makes to Israel means that its interventions will always be problematical. Europe has a double historical obligation towards the region: it was on European soil that 6m Jews were murdered within living memory; and it was the British who were the first architects of partition. But beyond this - and in the absence of any clear indication as to President Bush's intentions, or lack of them - there is an obvious opportunity for Europe to play a role of the sort that is impossible for the two peoples locked in miserable mutual hatred. Some of this pressure will be - and should be - uncomfortable for Israel. One immediate measure would be to suspend Israel's association agreement with the union. Another is to look at the vexed question of \"rules of origin\" which Israel has long abused by exporting to the EU goods produced in occupied Arab territories, including in illegal Jewish settlements, to gain duty-free access. Europe is also well-placed to apply pressure on the Palestinians. As it demands a freeze on settlements the EU should demand of Arafat that he uses all his authority to enforce a ceasefire, to prevent incitement towards violence and to control his own security services. These hopeful strands are, each of them, fragile. They are easily obliterated from mind at a time - such as the past three days - when disgustingly random attacks by both sides kill and maim the innocent. But Israel - which has by far the greater power and which takes pride in its democratic society - has a great responsibility to take the lead in breaking the unutterably vicious cycle in which it is so fruitlessly locked. One suicide bomber in a shopping centre in Netanya demonstrated the futility of imagining that there is a security solution to this awful mess. There isn't. There is only a political solution; and one day - whether it is one month, one year or 10 years away - Israeli and Palestinian leaders will once more have to sit around the same table and continue where they left off in Taba last January. Between now and that day there will be much horrible reality which most of us will find hard to bear. Meanwhile Jews the world over should think deeply about the terrible cost of securing their necessary sanctuary. Israel has accumulated massive power over the past two generations: it is not clear that it yet knows how to use it humanely."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
