The public are gradually catching up, and the Cosmics' Enjoy the Melodic Sunshine album is reportedly selling 2,000 copies a week six months after release. The rapt York audience know the words to all the songs and greet the band like heroes. After pint-sized frontman Daniel Wylie's opening a cappella blast at an old Richard Thompson number, the band launch into Revolution in the Summertime, and their chiming Rickenbacker magnificence floods forth. But, despite their undeniably 1960s-rooted sounds, the Cosmics are not mere retro rockers. Hailing from the rough Castlemilk area of Glasgow, the hazy melodic ecstasy in their songs is tempered by a postmodern cynicism. Live, the darker moods shadowing the album become even more vivid. Wylie explains that You've Got Me (one of several that could be the best song REM have never written) was penned for a friend who later committed suicide over \"drugs and stuff\". The lyrics are delivered with a poignancy pop should always aspire to but rarely reaches. Mostly, though, this is a night of celebration. The five Cosmics don't really look like stars but are so enthusiastic that charisma radiates from them, whether it's lanky guitarist Stephen Fleming contorting his face while delivering yet another sun-soaked vocal harmony, or Wylie's Glaswegian warmth and wit. He introduces the gorgeous Melanie as \"our Top 100 single. Unfortunately it only reached number 100.\" The bittersweet new single, Baby You're So Free, may do better, but the Cosmics are on to something that cuts deeper than chart positions. By the closing bars of revenge fantasy The Loser, the cheers are so loud it's a wonder Wylie doesn't levitate from the building. \"Goodnight,\" he splutters. \"Pop music is not dead!\" Indeed. Awesome. \u0095 Cosmic Rough Riders play On Air East, Dundee (01382 228496) tonight, then tour."}, "isHosted": false}}}
