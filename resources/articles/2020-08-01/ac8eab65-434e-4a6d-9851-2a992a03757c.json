Two-thirds of women in abusive relationships have suffered more violence from their partners during the pandemic, according to an investigation by the BBC\u2019s Panorama. Three-quarters of victims also say the lockdown has made it harder for them to escape their abusers. The joint investigation by Panorama and Women\u2019s Aid is the first in-depth study into how the nationwide shutdown in response to Covid-19 has impacted victims of domestic abuse. Using statistics obtained from UK police forces under freedom of information laws, the Panorama programme, to be screened on Monday evening, reveals that there was one domestic abuse call every 30 seconds in the first seven weeks of lockdown. The recorded calls include reports of violent offences such as kidnap, arson, revenge porn and even poisoning. On the programme, presented by Victoria Derbyshire, one woman, using the name Jess, explains how the pandemic had intensified the abuse she was enduring. On the night the lockdown was announced, she said, her husband told her what this meant for her. She said: \u201cI was at home with him, we were both listening to Boris Johnson and he looked over at me, he had his arms folded back and chest out, cos he knew that would intimidate me, and he looked at me and he said: \u2018let the games begin\u2019.\u201d \u201cAnd he said: \u2018If you think it was bad before with the rape, you\u2019re in for a rough ride.\u2019 So the rape started really, really, really bad, really bad. Curtains would get closed, TV would be up loud, front door would be locked, music would be turned up, so nobody could hear me screaming for someone, for anybody.\u201d Asked if she could recall how many times she was raped during lockdown, Jess said it was \u201ca hundred easily, if not more\u201d. Women\u2019s welfare groups warned that the lockdown would result in an increase in domestic abuse and violence. Nineteen days after lockdown began, the government announced it would give an additional \u00a32m to domestic abuse helplines, and launched a social media campaign to encourage people to report domestic abuse. But Fiona Dwyer, CEO of the women\u2019s aid charity Solace, told Panorama: \u201cThe timing was dreadful, it should not have taken 19 days to mobilise any sort of action. And what it highlights is that it wasn\u2019t a priority for the government, it wasn\u2019t thought about for the better part of three weeks \u2026 and then \u00a32m is just really \u2026 it\u2019s a poor effort.\u201d Victoria Atkins, the minister for safeguarding, told Panorama that she does not believe the government was too slow to act. \u201cWhen we were talking to charities in the very, very earliest days, we were very much responding,\u201d she said. \u201cWe said to them: what do you need for us to help? So we very much focused on that practical help whilst also preparing for the charities [fund] that the chancellor announced and then the additional \u00a32 million for helplines.\u201d In the UK, call the national domestic abuse helpline on 0808 2000 247, or visit Women\u2019s Aid. In Australia, the national family violence counselling service is on 1800 737 732. In the US, the domestic violence hotline is 1-800-799-SAFE (7233).
