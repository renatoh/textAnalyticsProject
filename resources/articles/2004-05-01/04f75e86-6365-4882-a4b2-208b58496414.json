Annie Kindleysides, of Meaburn Hill Farm House, Cumbria, won because of her caring nature and amazing home-grown breakfasts, according to the Automobile Association. 'The concept of the landlady is a bit of a joke,' said Peter Birnie, chief hotel inspector for the AA, 'but it's a professional operation. B&amp;Bs are not all beachside places run by a cross old lady. They are dealing with international travellers.' AA inspectors nominated 100 landladies from 4,000 B&amp;Bs in the AA B&amp;B Guide 2004, and after a selection process including written tests, mystery telephone calls and an overnight stay from an undercover judge, a shortlist of 20 competitors attended the awards ceremony last week. A former teacher and relative newcomer to the industry, Kindleysides has run the business since 2001. 'The award has highlighted the plight of a growing number of small farms that are being forced to branch out into accommodation and organic food to survive what is now a very difficult and competitive farming market,' she said. 'I grew up on the farm, I make my own bread and preserves, use local organic meat and grow summer vegetables. Now I want to get a poly tunnel to grow organic food all year, and get a sheep and pig.' AA managing director Roger Wood said the foot and mouth crisis and problems in the Middle East had hit tourism, but in the last few years there had been a steady increase in visitors staying in B&amp;Bs. 'This January we had a 45 per cent increase on last January,' he said. 'B&amp;Bs offer exceptional value for money.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
