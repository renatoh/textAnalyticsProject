A fulsome Centre Court crowd, along with thousands more scrunched tight on the Hill to watch her semi-final against Venus Williams, knew precisely the anguish she was going through. They willed the British No1\u2019s piledrivers home, gasping and rasping every time a winner pinged off her racket. But, as Williams\u2019 immense class and experience began fully to emerge, hope gave way to the painful realisation that this would not be Konta\u2019s year. The 6-4, 6-2 score was harsh but no one doubted that the better player had won \u2013 and won well. The 26-year-old Konta had arrived on Centre Court hoping to become the first British woman to win a Wimbledon singles\u2019 semi-final since Virginia Wade toppled Chris Evert in three topsy-turvy sets in 1977. One contemporary match report noted the crowds \u201cmurmurs of pleasurable surprise\u201d, yet stressed \u201cthey were happy but dared not make it too obvious\u201d. Forty years on the crowd had no such inhibitions. Konta was given a standing ovation as she walked on to court. What followed was furious and unrelenting. Williams is one of the 90s originators of power tennis; Konta one of her progeny. Few rallies lasted much more than four shots. It was brutal and often astounding. Unfortunately for the home crowd, Konta was unable to take the thin opportunities that tumbled her way. At 4-4 in the first set, she had two break points which came and went in a flash \u2013 as Williams saved the first and then smashed down a 106mph second serve to wriggle out of the next. \u201cIt was one of the few opportunities I had and she took that away,\u201d admitted Konta, who rapidly surrendered her concentration, her serve and the first set. At this stage the Hill \u2013 or Kontamanjaro as some wags dubbed it \u2013 still believed. Among the fans were three young men sporting home-made T-shirts bearing the slogans \u201cYou Konta touch this\u201d, \u201cI Konta believe it\u201d and \u201cYou Konta be serious\u201d. But soon the gaps between the shouts grew longer. Reality had started to bite. Konta had survived several lengthy battles at this Wimbledon, including a three-hour-10-minute epic against Donna Vekic \u2013 the longest match in the women\u2019s tournament \u2013 but this time she had no answer to the barrage coming from the other side of the net. It was not that she played badly but Williams\u2019s movement was just sharper, her hitting spikier. Throughout the contest the American\u2019s serve also remained an undecipherable puzzle, with Konta winning only 13 of 50 points on it all match. As she later conceded: \u201cIt was very difficult for me to get a good foothold in the match. It came down on the day, and Venus played better than me. I don\u2019t think I did too much wrong out there. I think it was all credit to her.\u201d Williams will now face the Spanish player Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza, who steamrollered Magdalena Rybarikova 6-1, 6-1 in 64 minutes, in Saturday\u2019s final. If the American were to add to her five Wimbledon titles \u2013 the last of which she won in 2008 \u2013 she will become the oldest Wimbledon champion since 1908. Those grand slam winning days had appeared to be long gone when she was diagnosed with Sjogrens syndrome, which causes immense fatigue and leads to swollen joints, in 2011. Yet here she is at 37, having reached the final of the Australian Open in January and now with the rich scent of another title wafting towards her nostrils. \u201cI had a lot of issues and this year has been amazing in terms of my play, so of course I\u2019m excited about being in another final,\u201d she said. Last week Williams had also broken down at a press conference when asked about being blamed for a car accident in which an elderly passenger in another vehicle was killed. The police\u2019s verdict has since been reversed and Williams carries a lightness that was not evident then. And with Roger Federer the favourite on the men\u2019s side there is every chance that Wimbledon could see a startling throwback in time to 2005 and 2007, when Federer and Williams \u2013 then in the prime of their careers \u2013 were crowned the singles\u2019 champions. Konta insisted afterwards that she could yet join them. She knows there is room for improvement \u2013 she barely played a slice, a vicious weapon in the hands of Martina Navratilova and Steffi Graf, or came to the net. But the way she has risen from 147 in the world in June 2015 to a top-five position next week gives plenty of reason for optimism. Wimbledon, as well as Konta\u2019s mum, will hope for many more nailbiting moments in the future."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
