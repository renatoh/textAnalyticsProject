Romney's put together a just large enough coalition of high-wage earners, non-evangelicals, and non-very conservatives to help him slog to a majority of delegates by May, though perhaps as late as June. This scenario envisions the race staying static. Romney would lose in the south, great plains, and perhaps a rust belt state or two, while racking up large margins in New England, the west, and the territories. It also takes into account Newt Gingrich exiting the race and leaving Rick Santorum as Romney's only viable rival. With some minor differences in certain states, I agree with Nate Silver's analysis of how Romney is in a strong position eventually to rack up a majority of delegates. But what if we're wrong? Jonathan Bernstein, who has been one of the most on-point analysts of this race that I've seen, sketches out two other possible scenarios. The first seems the more unlikely: Santorum wins establishment backing and comes from behind to take the nomination. Santorum has shown little ability to win outside his main constituencies (working class, very conservative, evangelicals). The establishment has been hesitant to back him (beyond the stray Mike DeWine). The second possible outcome wouldn't match up with what we are seeing this year, but it would fit with historical patterns: Romney romping to the nomination. In 2008, John McCain began winning blowouts in states he might not necessarily have expected to do well in, after taking a commanding delegate lead on Super Tuesday. He received the backing of former rivals (such as Mitt Romney) and wrapped up the nomination a month later. I was quite skeptical that Romney could \"do a McCain\", but there are some signs he might be able to. Polls out from Alabama and Mississippi (two of the most Romney-unfriendly states in the nation) indicate that Romney is actually quite competitive. He's, at worst, a very close second or third in each state, and is actually leading in one recent poll in each state. Part of what's happening in Alabama and Mississippi is what we've seen all along: a split of Romney's conservative opposition. In the four southern primaries in 2012, Romney's gotten 26%, 28%, 28%, and 28% of the vote. As long as Ron Paul garners 5%, Romney can win either primary with no more than 31-32% of the vote \u2013 which he could potentially do with some advertising and a bit of luck. More worrisome to Romney's rivals is that Romney is doing fairly well among very conservative voters in each state. According to Rasmussen, Romney's taking 21% of the very conservative vote in Alabama and 31% of it in Mississippi. The 21% would be higher than the teens' share he received in both South Carolina and Tennessee, and the 31% would be 10 percentage points greater than he got in Oklahoma. If Romney is winning over these voters in the Deep South, then he'd probably win them over anywhere. But even if Romney isn't reaching into the Gingrich/Santorum base, a win by split-competition could create a media narrative that paints Romney as truly inevitable. We've seen how the media can impact this race before (for example, by amplifying Santorum's surge after taking Colorado, Minnesota, and the \"beauty contest\" Missouri primary). An unexpected Romney victory in the Deep South would likely provide him with great momentum \u2013 and calls on the other candidates to exit the race could echo for many miles. Now, I'm still quite doubtful whether Romney can pull off a southern surprise, but that doesn't mean he won't benefit from Alabama and Mississippi losses. Newt Gingrich has set up Alabama and Mississippi as must-win contests. The polling indicates that Gingrich is likely to be the candidate who comes out on top in those two states, if it isn't Romney. Gingrich staying in the race does nothing but help Romney win toss-up states (for example, Illinois and Wisconsin). Gingrich has shown an inability to connect with voters outside the Deep South, but he has siphoned off enough voters to allow Romney to skim by with vote percentages of 41% or below in Michigan and Ohio. Where Gingrich is likely stronger (Arkansas, Kentucky and North Carolina, among other states), Romney's viability would extend to states he would have little chance in otherwise. With a plausible Gingrich campaign continuing, Romney would likely wrap up the nomination no later than early June, and probably by May, with a clear majority of delegates. A few days ago, I thought Alabama and Mississippi would provide Rick Santorum with the opportunity to clinch the one-on-one runoff against Romney he desired. Now, it looks like Romney has all the upside. Who would have thought it?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
