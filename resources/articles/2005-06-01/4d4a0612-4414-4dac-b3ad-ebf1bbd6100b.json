Hundreds of parents, many on low incomes, could be forced to quit their jobs if the clubs shut, as they provide affordable childcare before and after school. The news came after the education secretary, Ruth Kelly, yesterday unveiled a \u00a3680m plan for a massive expansion of school-based childcare, breakfast clubs and after-school activities in England. The Northern Ireland out-of-school organisation, PlayBoard, issued a plea to the government to extend to the province its latest package of help for after-school clubs in England. The group said the threat of closure was due to short-term European and lottery funding had almost run out, and the government had not earmarked any specific longer-term funding for such clubs. \"The voluntary out-of-school sector in Northern Ireland is now in real danger of being virtually wiped out,\" said PlayBoard's chief executive, Marguerite Hunter Blair. She added: \"It's a cruel irony that Ruth Kelly is announcing expansion of such provision in England, while almost all voluntary out-of-school clubs here are struggling to survive. We urgently need some of that cash.\" Voluntary out-of-school clubs specialise in providing high quality but affordable childcare, often for the children of parents who can't afford private care, she said. Hundreds of parents could be forced to give up their jobs if the clubs closed, PlayBoard warned. \"The parents who would lose their jobs are those on low incomes who can least afford to do so,\" said Ms Hunter Blair. \"Northern Ireland has the highest rate of child poverty in the UK. Our after school clubs are helping to tackle that problem - so why is the government forcing so many clubs in Northern Ireland to close?\" she asked. Northern Ireland education minister, Angela Smith, who is already under intense pressure to find more money for cash-strapped schools - is expected to respond that her cupboard is bare. Under Ruth Kelly's plans, primary schools in England and Wales will get \u00a330,000 for the next two years and secondaries will get \u00a350,000 to start wrap-around activities and childcare from 8am to 6pm. But after that they are expected to make the services \"sustainable\" by charging parents and other social and health services for the facilities."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
