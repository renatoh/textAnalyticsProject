Blame the Lawn Tennis Association for years of dumb introspection, believing that they knew what was best for British tennis without having a clue how the international game was developing. Five years ago, when Britain lost its last Davis Cup world group match in Sydney against Australia, with both Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski absent, a senior LTA official opined with all seriousness that \"the great lesson learned was that to be a top tennis player you have to be fit\". This time matters are a little different, or potentially so. Just under two years ago Stuart Smith, president of the LTA and a combative personality, brought in Roger Draper as the chief executive to bring about a new reality. Some will already argue he has failed after Argentina took a winning 3-0 lead over Britain today when David Nalbandian and Jose Acasuso defeated Jamie Murray and Ross Hutchins in the doubles. But that would be crass. True, the Smith and Draper regime has made some short-term mistakes. There has been little too much emphasis on foreign coaches, some of them part-time, which hardly sends out the right message, while loose talk of targets, x players (pick any number) in the top 100 by 2010 or 2012, or whatever, did nobody any favours. But this is recognised. Nobody is passing the buck. At least, not yet. The seeds of Britain's current demise were sown long before Smith and Draper teamed up, and those ex-LTA employees currently and persistently sniping from the wings are the very people who singularly failed to achieve anything while they had positions of influence. They will say that had they stayed in power, or been given the sort of money currently being splashed out, everything would have been different. They are deluding themselves. They had their chance and blew it. Draper makes enemies. That is the nature of the way he works. Slash and burn, it might be called. But then there was a hell of a lot to light a fire under at the LTA. He believes, as does Smith, that a realistic structure is being put into place that will ultimately produce, and it is the current crop of under-14s and younger that is engendering that optimism. Of course, it has all been heard before. Five-year plans have come and gone with monotonous regularity without any significant change. Tennis is a recreational sport in Britain, where old farts play endless doubles and do their level best to keep the youngsters away. This is changing, although nobody can be the least sure if it will make any difference. For a decade Henman and the imported Rusedski papered over the cracks. Those cracks have now become a chasm, with Andy Murray the only singles player, man or woman, in the top 100. Murray is not much liked by the general public, principally because those who advise him have no idea about public or press relations, though ultimately it will not mater one jot if he delivers by winning one of the world's majors and inspires a generation. Draper is not liked much either, but if Britain produces more than one or two top players, in addition to Murray, in the next decade then he will be deemed to have been a success. It remains a moot question as to whether the LTA should be taking it upon itself to produce players at all, but such a change would need a greater revolution than Smith and Draper are ever likely to contemplate. For the time being - and it may be a long time - Britain will not have a Davis Cup team capable of playing in the elite world group if Murray decides, for whatever reason, not to play. It is to be hoped he will, though it will be understandable if he doesn't."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
