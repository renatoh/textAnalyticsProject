The board of the club\u2019s parent company, Birmingham International Holdings, which is registered in the Cayman Islands and floated on the Hong Kong stock exchange, said in a statement: \u201cThe board has recently discovered that \u2026 a former employee of the company may have misappropriated a sum of at least HK$30m belonging to the group since December 2013. \u201cThe company has reported the suspected misappropriation to the Hong Kong police and they are investigating.\u201d Yeung, who led the \u00a381.5m purchase of the club from David Sullivan and David Gold, was convicted of laundering \u00a355m proceeds of crime in March 2014. BIHL is a small company understood to employ around 15 people and is embroiled in a boardroom battle, in which the serving directors claim Yeung is seeking from prison to have three people close to him appointed directors. Last week the Football League wrote to the club asking if Yeung, barred as a director owing to his conviction but who still owns 27.5% of BIHL, is wielding director-level influence. The BIHL statement did not name the former employee alleged to have misappropriated the money and said it was considering setting up its own investigation. The company also expressed concern that its former auditor did not raise the suspected misappropriation during its audit of the financial year to 30 June 2014. The statement did not name the auditor but the accounts for that year state it was JH CPA Alliance of Hong Kong. No one from that firm was available to respond to a request for comment from the Guardian. BIHL said it was concerned about the possible effect the misappropriation would have, saying it may have \u201ca material impact on the operation and financial situation of the group\u201d. St Andrew\u2019s, where the team has experienced a revival on the pitch since the appointment of Gary Rowett as the manager, sources stressed that even though the \u00a32.55m may not have been noted as misappropriated, it was accounted for as having been spent. The club therefore maintains they are not suffering an unexpected shortfall of money."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
