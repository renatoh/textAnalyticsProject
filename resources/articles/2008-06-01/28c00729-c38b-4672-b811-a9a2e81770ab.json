Lantra, the sector skills council for environmental and land-based trades, put forward this doomsday scenario, pointing out that 15,900 farming jobs are being lost every year and that 38% of the agricultural workforce is expected to retire within the next 10 years. But surely it is super-hype to suggest there will be no farmers left in the UK in less than 30 years' time? Peter Martin, Lantra's chief executive, says there are signs the farming landscape is already changing. \"I recently attended an open day at a farm where there were fields full of asparagus rotting in the ground because there was no one available to cut the crop,\" he says. \"We fear that the same issues will crop up during the fruit-picking season. A farmer may need a thousand people to harvest a crop that 40 have planted. If those thousand are not available, then what will happen to those 40 people who are employed full-time?\" Martin says the supply of Polish workers is drying up, and migrants from other EU accession countries such as Romania and Bulgaria do not come with the skills to enable them to do the work. He warns that without urgent action by industry and the government, Britain's food supply could become vulnerable and it will be necessary to look towards foreign markets on a much larger scale. Already, less than 60% of the food eaten in the UK is home grown. Gordon McGlone, Lantra's chair, says about a million people are employed in the land-based sector, with an additional 500,000 volunteer workers in industries providing more than a twentieth of gross domestic product. The sector needs to attract 21,500 new staff each year, he says. \"This is the minimum number required to stem the tide of skills being lost and businesses going into decline as talented people leave our industries. At present, we are achieving around 4,600. Inevitably, there won't be enough people available to grow the food and look after the countryside.\" He says the money is available in the training system to meet these challenges, but there needs to be more flexibility in how it is distributed. Under the present system, adult careers-changers and those who already have level 2 qualifications equivalent to five good GCSEs cannot obtain funding for training. Dave Ashurst, a national training manager at conservation organisation BTCV, says people who come into the industry with a university background are no longer entitled to training funds. \"We have Train to Gain funding, but that is not necessarily appropriate for the courses we deliver. We are cutting off a lot of entry into environmental conservation,\" he says. \"Train to Gain funding is for full qualifications and is not allowing people to build qualifications in bite-sized units. We were delivering a short-course programme to 10,500 students a year funded by the Learning and Skills Council. That funding ceased two years ago, and now we have just 1,500 students on these courses.\" David Lammy, the skills minister, said at the campaign launch that he wants to work with Lantra to \"really develop the right sort of qualifications to help the sector move forward\". The two key challenges facing society today, he said, were climate change and food security. \"Whatever the economic challenges we face, we cannot survive without a proper agricultural skills base.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
