If you\u2019d like to read yet more, my colleagues Dan Sabbagh and Luke Harding have tonight\u2019s main story: Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s events: Sir Lindsay Hoyle was confirmed as the new Commons Speaker, succeeding John Bercow. Hoyle won the election after four rounds of voting eliminated the other six candidates. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, lied during the Brexit referendum campaign, the outgoing president of the European commission said. Jean-Claude Juncker made the accusation in an interview with the German newspaper Der Spiegel, in which he also said pro-European politicians, including his friend Tony Blair, had helped lay Brexit\u2019s foundations. Opposition party leaders complained about their exclusion from a head-to-head election debate, with the Lib Dems\u2019 Jo Swinson claiming the decision relating her could be motivated by sexism. Swinson said the people choosing to exclude her from the ITV event could be \u201csexist\u201d, or \u201cscared\u201d, or both. The SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon also warned broadcasters to reflect politics \u201cas it is and not just how you want it to be\u201d. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, insisted his party would hurt Labour as he sought to play down the threat to the Tories. Nevertheless, Jacob Rees-Mogg called on Farage to \u201cretire from the field\u201d, citing his concern that the Brexit party could snatch defeat from the jaws of victory by splitting the leave-friendly vote. Sinn F\u00e9in was among the parties to stand down in some Northern Irish constituencies to make way for remain-friendly candidates. Perhaps most notably, the party\u2019s move opened a path to victory for one unionist candidate: the independent MP, Silvia Hermon. The nationalist SDLP also agreed to stand aside in some contests for a similar reason. Elsewhere, fragile unionist pacts were shaken \u2013 but held. Senior figures in the health service expressed alarm that the NHS was being used as a \u201cpolitical weapon\u201d. They called for public debate about the NHS to be based on \u201crealistic expectations\u201d. Plaid Cymru kicked off its election campaign, accusing Boris Johnson of being \u201cresolutely dishonest\u201d. Adam Price, the party\u2019s leader, also said Jeremy Corbyn had been \u201csadly proven ... clueless\u201d. The party put Welsh independence at the centre of its programme. The former Labour MP, John Woodcock, announced he will not stand for reelection. Woodcock is standing down because he and his partner are having a baby. LBC has confirmed that the Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, will not host his radio show during the general election campaign, saying the step is designed to ensure compliance with Ofcom rules. Farage actually addressed the issue as he closed his show last week, saying that remaining a broadcaster and the leader of a political party during an election campaign would \u201cclearly\u201d mean he would \u201chave a bit of a conflict\u201d. The prime minister has written to the opposition leader, Jeremy Corbyn, demanding that he set out his position on Brexit and accusing him of wanting to \u201cgo back to square one\u201d on the issue. Boris Johnson, who himself voted against Theresa May\u2019s deal twice \u2013 before eventually backing it at the third attempt, claimed Jeremy Corbyn had blocked his Brexit deal when it came before the Commons. While Labour voted against the bill that would have implemented the deal, it passed its second reading in the Commons. Rather than being blocked, it was in fact pulled by the prime minister after MPs refused to allow him to rush it through parliament. Accusing the Labour leader of spending \u201cconsiderable time and energy seeking to undermine the [Brexit] negotiations\u201d, Johnson said Corbyn has also \u201csought to avoid\u201d setting out a clear Brexit plan of his own: Your current position seems to be that you want to go back to square one. You want to throw out the great new deal we have reached with our European friends and, instead, negotiate a whole new treaty from scratch. Even assuming the EU agrees to go back to the very beginning, this will take months and possibly years to do \u2013 under your proposals, 2020 will be lost to more dither and delay over Brexit. Voters also have the right to know: What would your supposed Brexit \u2018deal\u2019 actually take back control of? For months, you have refused to say what sort of \u2018deal\u2019 you want with the EU. Now the time has come for you to come clean, and explain what your plan really is so when the public vote on 12 December, they know what they are voting for. Speaking to the Guardian today, Corbyn sought to set out his stance on Brexit, saying the party would negotiate a new deal with Brussels \u2013 including a closer trading relationship \u2013 within three months and put it to the public in a referendum within six. He has insisted Labour will stick to the plan not to declare a possible referendum position until after the election: Two of the 540 votes cast were spoiled, Clarke told MPs. Looking at the numbers, while Bryant again increased his vote by the greater proportion of the two candidates \u2013 about 26% \u2013 Hoyle almost kept pace with him; increasing his own by about 22%, having started from a much higher base. In the end, it wasn\u2019t that close. Hoyle\u2019s winning margin of 112 represented more than half of Bryant\u2019s total number of final round votes: 213. It is true, of course, to say there is no base from which to start, with each MP being free to switch their support between rounds \u2013 even if their previously preferred candidate is still in the race. But, while each candidate does indeed start from zero in each round, it\u2019s reasonable to assume a large proportion stuck with their candidate. Back in March 2013, shortly after Hoyle successfully presided over a \u201cboisterous budget day\u201d, the Guardian\u2019s former political editor Michael White profiled the then deputy speaker. Hoyle\u2019s handling of those proceedings, White wrote, had made him a \u201cparliamentary star in pinstripes\u201d. Here\u2019s how Hoyle saw it: So once a year it\u2019s my day. I\u2019m in charge and I look forward to it. It\u2019s a highlight, the biggest day of the parliamentary year. The mood in the chamber is electric, you can feel the tension. Here\u2019s a little more from Hoyle\u2019s moving tribute to his daughter, delivered from the Speaker\u2019s chair in the Commons chamber. He told MPs: There is one person who\u2019s not here: My daughter, Natalie. I wish she\u2019d have been here, we all miss her as a family; no more so than her mum. I\u2019ve got to say, she was everything to all of us. She will always be missed but she will always be in our thoughts. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said Hoyle would \u201cstand up for the principle\u201d of parliamentary democracy\u201d. He added: The job of Speaker is not just a ceremonial one. It is about the rights of backbenchers to be able to speak up. It is about the power of parliament to hold the government to account. That is the whole principle and point of a parliamentary democracy; that we have a strong parliament that can hold the executive to account. And I know you will stand up for that principle because that is what you believe in. Here\u2019s a little more on the comments made by the prime minister after Hoyle took the Speaker\u2019s chair. He said: Mr Speaker, in congratulating you on your election I observe that you have prevailed over an extremely strong field and that every other candidate earlier on spoke forcibly and well. Speaking for myself, after long, happy years of dealing with you, I think I know what it is. And let me say, whenever any of us is preparing to speak in this chamber, we all know there is a moment between standing up and when the Speaker calls you when your heart is in your mouth. And, in that moment of anxiety about whether you\u2019re going to make a fool of yourself and so on and indeed at the moment when we sit down amid deafening silence, the kindliness of the Speaker is absolutely critical to our confidence and the way we behave. And, Mr Speaker, over the years I have observed that you have many good qualities and I\u2019m sure you will stick up for backbenchers in the way that you have proposed and I\u2019m sure that you will adhere to a strict Newtonian concept of time in PMQs. But I believe you will also bring your signature kindness, kindness and reasonableness to our proceedings, and thereby to help to bring us together as a Parliament and a democracy. Because, no matter how fiercely we may disagree, we know that every member comes to this place with the best of motives, determined to solve, to serve the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world. And, to achieve our goals by the peaceable arts of reason and debate invigilated by an impartial Speaker, which was and remains one of our greatest gifts to the world. Thank you Mr Speaker, and congratulations. Dame Eleanor Laing, who was eliminated after the third round of voting, has tweeted her congratulations to Hoyle: And she has been joined in so doing by a host of parliamentary colleagues: In his speech, Hoyle also paid tribute to Clarke, telling MPs: I stand by what I said, I stand firm, that I hope this House will be once a great respected House, not just in here but across the world. It\u2019s the envy and we\u2019ve got to make sure that tarnish is polished away, that the respect and tolerance that we expect from everyone who works in here will be shown and we\u2019ll keep that in order. Boris Johnson rises to thank Clarke and congratulate Hoyle. He says the new Speaker \u201cprevailed over an extremely strong field\u201d. He adds that he believes it was Hoyle\u2019s \u201csignature kindness\u201d towards MPs that led his colleagues to elect him. Jeremy Corbyn adds his own congratulations to Hoyle and thanks to Clarke, saying the former will need eyes in the back of his head. He jokes about the photograph posted online at the weekend of Hoyle \u201capparently watching the rugby cup final while, at the same time, not watching the television\u201d. The image, Corbyn suggests, may be evidence that Hoyle does indeed have the requisite qualification for the job. Hoyle is dragged to the chair in the traditional way by Caroline Flint and Nigel Evans and begins his remarks by thanking the other candidates. He jokes that there should be no clapping; one of the issues Bryant placed at the heart of his campaign. And Hoyle pays tribute to his daughter Natalie Lewis-Hoyle, who died in 2017 and whom he says his family misses a great deal. Hoyle closes by saying he does not want to detain MPs any longer and says the House will change for the better. For the first time, the new Speaker calls the prime minister to the dispatch box. Sir Lindsay Hoyle has been elected as the next Commons Speaker, replacing John Bercow. The favourite beat Chris Bryant by 112 votes in the fourth and final round, having already seen off Dame Eleanor Laing, Harriet Harman and Dame Rosie Winterton, as well as Sir Edward Leigh and Meg Hillier, in earlier rounds. In total, 540 MPs voted in the final round; 25 fewer than in the previous one. Here are the results (with those from the previous rounds in brackets, beginning with the more recent): Sir Lindsay Hoyle: 325 (267, 244 and 211) Chris Bryant 213 (169, 120 and 98) The Father of the House, Ken Clarke, has returned to the chamber and, it appears, is about to announce the results of the final round of voting in the election of the next Speaker. Jeremy Corbyn will visit a 10th Tory-held target seat since the general election was called last Tuesday in a deliberate signal that Labour is determined to fight an attacking campaign, despite the anxieties of some of its MPs, my colleague Heather Stewart writes. In Harlow, in Essex, he will give a speech about Brexit, following visits to a string of other areas, including Putney, Milton Keynes and Crawley. He will head north later in the week, when parliament has been dissolved. Party strategists claim to have drawn up a list of almost 100 seats that could be within their sights, notwithstanding the Conservatives\u2019 comfortable poll lead. All three candidates appear to have benefited from the previous round\u2019s eliminations but Bryant saw the greatest increase in support from the second round to the third. Chris Bryant: An increase of 49 votes, or about 40% Sir Lindsay Hoyle: An increase of 23 votes, or about 9% Dame Eleanor Laing: An increase of 5 votes, or about 4% There were two spoiled votes, Clarke tells the Commons, and 10 fewer MPs cast their ballot in this latest round than in the second. Bryant is 98 short of Hoyle\u2019s total. So, should a significant proportion of those who voted for Laing stick around and switch to him, Bryant could yet overhaul the favourite. There is another way of looking at that, of course: *Please note: I put a set of brackets in the wrong place in the previous post, giving an incorrect figure for Chris Bryant\u2019s latest level of support. I\u2019ve corrected it but you may need to refresh your screen to see the accurate results. The Father of the House, Ken Clarke, has returned to his seat in the Commons and is announcing the results. Here they are (with the second round\u2019s results in brackets): Sir Lindsay Hoyle 267 (244) Chris Bryant 169 (120) Dame Eleanor Laing 127 (122) Laing is eliminated, Clarke says. Bryant and Hoyle will go through to a final round. The Guardian has just published its editorial on Labour\u2019s general election campaign, saying Corbyn\u2019s plans are \u201crequired to repair the damage caused by a system that is being run in favour of privileged individuals whose market and political power allows them to extract cash from everyone else\u201d. Labour aims to radically transform Britain; it is a change that is long overdue. The public are quite rightly fed up with the idea that an economic bloodletting is a necessary purgative after the excesses of a boom. Labour recognised this in 2017 and reaped the benefit. Since then, the Tories have sought to claim that they have fixed the economy \u2013 and therefore they can go some way to matching Labour\u2019s spending pledges, at least in the election campaign. If ending austerity means ditching self-imposed fiscal targets, Boris Johnson reasons, so be it. Yet the public is entitled to ask why the state was in so many areas deliberately rolled back, reducing aggregate demand when the economy would have benefited from it. As we await the results of this round of voting, here\u2019s what Parliament has to say on the office and role of the Speaker: Speakers must be politically impartial. Therefore, on election the new Speaker must resign from their political party and remain separate from political issues even in retirement. However, the Speaker will deal with their constituents\u2019 problems like a normal MP. Speakers still stand in general elections. They are generally unopposed by the major political parties, who will not field a candidate in the Speaker\u2019s constituency \u2013 this includes the original party they were a member of. During a general election, Speakers do not campaign on any political issues but simply stand as \u2018the Speaker seeking re-election\u2019. A majority of voters think Jo Swinson should be included in the ITV leaders\u2019 debate featuring Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, a YouGov poll suggests. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over. In the chamber Ken Clarke has just announced that Harriet Harman is pulling out. That means there are three candidates left: Sir Lindsay Hoyle, Dame Eleanor Laing, and Chris Bryant. New ballot papers are being printed, and then the ballot opens. We should get the final result soon after 7pm. Some 575 MPs voted in the second ballot - 13 more than in the first round. Assuming they all keep voting, that means a candidate needs 288 votes to win. Sir Lindsay Hoyle is short by 44. Ken Clarke has just read out the results of the second round of voting. Here they are (with the results from the first round in brackets). Sir Lindsay Hoyle: 244 (211) Dame Eleanor Laing: 122 (113) Chris Bryant: 120 (98) Harriet Harman: 59 (72) Dame Rosie Winterton: 30 (46) Winterton has now been eliminated. Hoyle has extended his lead, but he is still short of the votes he needs. In the Commons the division bells are ringing, which means the results of the next round of voting in the election of the new Speaker will be announced soon. Sky News is now proposing a three-way leaders\u2019s debate, involving Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader. And Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister and leader of the SNP, has described the decision to exclude her as \u201coutrageous\u201d. Her party has 35 MPs, while Swinson\u2019s has just 19 - and eight of those are defectors from other parties. This morning Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, got the 8.10 slot on the Today programme to discuss Labour figures showing that almost 80,000 operations were cancelled last year. Ed Conway, Sky\u2019s economics editor, has posted a good thread on Twitter explaining this figure in context. Here are the key points. More than 400,000 EU citizens living in Britain applied for settled status in the last month, in a huge surge reflecting the threat of a no-deal Brexit. The number of total applications has now passed 2.2m, up from 1.8m in September, the Home Office has said, with around 17,000 applications per day. The new total represents 64% of the estimated 3.4m EU citizens living in the UK. The rise in applications in the last four weeks reflects concerns among EU citizens that they would be left in legal limbo if the UK had crashed out of the EU as threatened by Boris Johnson on 31 October. A spokesman for the Home Office said 1.8m had received either settled status (given to those in the country for five years or more) or pre-settled status (given to those in the country for fewer than five years). Some 400,000 applications are still being processed. EU citizens and their family members have until at least 31 December 2020 to apply whatever the outcome of Brexit. If the new prime minister seals a deal that deadline will be extended to June 2021. Wales is on course for a fundamental transformation in its political landscape with Welsh Labour\u2019s dominance under threat, the first opinion poll of the campaign in the country is suggesting. The YouGov poll for ITV-Cymru Wales and Cardiff University has the Tories level with Labour in Wales while the Brexit Party is in third place and the Lib Dems have lost ground. Here are the voting intention figures (with changes on the last poll conducted last month in brackets). Labour: 29 (+4) Conservatives: 28 (-1) Brexit party: 15 (+1) Liberal Democrats: 12 (-4) Plaid Cymru: 12 (no change) Greens: 3 (-1) Others: 1 (no change) In a blog Prof Roger Awan-Scully, head of politics and international relations at Cardiff University, cautiously suggests this could lead to Labour losing 10 seats in Wales, and the Conservatives gaining nine. These are from the New Statesman\u2019s Stephen Bush. As Bush points out, the election of the Commons Speaker is taking a while because MPs use an exhaustive ballot (successive rounds of voting, as candidates drop out). In the other main internal House of Commons elections, for select committee chairs, they use the alternative vote. The fact that they are not using first past the post (FPTP), the system used in the UK to elect MPs, might be seen as evidence that FPTP is not ideal and that there are much better voting systems available. But all the MPs who sit in the Commons have managed to get there via FPTP, and the arguments for replacing are rarely heard at the moment. (In fact, in the election campaign so far, the only party making a big issue of electoral reform is the Brexit party.) Probably not. There are now just 22 new votes up for grabs. Even if all of them go to Rosie Winterton, assuming no other changes, she would not catch Harriet Harman, and so there must be a strong chance of her dropping out after the next round of voting. That would free up 68 votes - almost all the 70 that Hoyle would need to win. (See 4.20am.) Of course, they won\u2019t all go to Hoyle. But it would be fair to assume that quite a few at least of the votes for Hillier and Winterton (both Labour MPs) will go to Hoyle (also a Labour MP). But Hillier and Winterton are also women, and many MPs may understandably be motivated by a desire to see another woman as Speaker, for only the second time in history. This could be Eleanor Laing\u2019s best route to victory. But is it a plausible one? Even if she were to pick up all the Hillier votes, and all the Winterton votes, and then all the Harriet Harman ones, she would still only be on 241 votes - 41 short of the 282 threshold. There are scenarios you can imagine which might see someone overhauling Hoyle. But, unlike a party leadership election, this isn\u2019t one of those ballots where people will switch to backing another candidate for personal advancement. It is a secret ballot, and even if MPs do tell the person who eventually wins they are backing their cause, there is little they will gain from the Speaker\u2019s patronage. He or she does not appoint a cabinet. And switching of this kind only normally happens in an election where voting is driven by a strong desire to block a particular candidate. But Hoyle does not inspire that sort of feelings in MPs. He is well liked, and he is easily acceptable to the house as a whole. We are not expecting to see an operation to scupper his chances. In other words, it is very hard to see how he does not end up as Speaker by the end of the day. Ken Clarke tells MPs that no candidate is dropping out. He says the new ballot papers will be printed. Labour\u2019s John Speller complains. He says there was no need to print new ballot papers. MPs could have managed with the original ones, he says. He says they would have known who had dropped out. Clarke says this is the system they are using. He suspends proceedings until the new ballot papers are printed. Ken Clarke announces the result. He says 562 MPs voted. The results are: Sir Lindsay Hoyle: 211 Dame Eleanor Laing: 113 Chris Bryant: 98 Harriet Harman: 72 Dame Rosie Winterton: 46 Sir Edward Leigh: 12 Meg Hillier: 10 Clarke says Hillier and Leigh are now out, because Hillier came last, and Leigh also received fewer than 5% of votes cast. He says any other candidate who wants to drop out must say so within the next 10 minutes. If the 562 MPs who voted stay for the rest of the day, a candidate needs 282 to get more than 50%. That means Hoyle is only 70 votes short of winning. In the Commons the division bells are ringing. That means the results of the first round of voting in the election of the new Speaker will be announced shortly. CapX\u2019s Robert Covile has picked up this gem from the BBC\u2019s coverage of the election of the new Speaker. Pro-remain independent unionist MP Lady Sylvia Hermon will hardly be punching the air with relief over Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald\u2019s endorsement of her in the forthcoming general election. (See 1.29pm.) North Down is a solidly unionist seat which is unique in being the only pro-union constituency in Northern Ireland that voted to remain in the 2016 EU referendum. However, many remain unionist voters remain solidly pro another union as well as being Europhile - the one between Northern Ireland and Britain. The most affluent parliamentary constituency in the region is also home to a large cohort of retired police officers and ex-military who admired Lady Hermon\u2019s late husband, the combative, often highly controversial former Royal Ulster Constabulary Chief Constable Jack Hermon. One veteran RUC detective whose own family were split down the middle between leave/remain in the Brexit referendum today described Sinn Fein\u2019s backing for Hermon as a potential \u201ckiss of death\u201d for the North Down MP. Whichever single unionist candidate stands against her in the campaign will use Sinn Fein\u2019s support for her throughout the weeks ahead in their bid to unseat her, he said. Whether he is right or wrong most long term observers of the Northern Irish political scene would agree that this was one endorsement Lady Hermon could have done without. In a statement outside the Houses of Parliament Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, is making a statement about the ITV proposal to exclude her from one of its election debates. ITV is holding one debate featuring just Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn. Swinson says she is the only woman standing to be prime minister. She says the people excluding her could be \u201csexist\u201d, or \u201cscared\u201d, or both She says the Lib Dems are taking legal advice about what they might be able to do if ITV does not change its mind. She says the party thinks this decision is not in line with Ofcom\u2019s code. She describes the decision as a \u201cstitch-up\u201d, and says the voice of remainers is being excluded. She goes on: Why are they so scared of taking on a girly swot? I\u2019ve beefed up some of the earlier posts with direct quotes, from the Press Association wires, from the speeches given by the seven candidates for Commons Speaker. To get the updates to appear, you may need to refresh the page. The UK\u2019s national terrorism threat level has been downgraded from severe to substantial for the first time in five years, the home secretary has said, although this means a terrorist attack is still likely, my colleagues Jamie Grierson and Vikram Dodd report. My colleague Peter Walker has more from the Brexit party event. Ken Clarke thanks Harman. He says he will open the ballot. But first he has to give an explanation of the voting process. It is not clear to MPs. (That is because they are voting by secret ballot, a process only ever used in the Commons for these votes, and for select committee elections.) He says the ballot will remain open for 20 minutes. Around 45 minutes after the ballot closes, the result will be announced. He declares the ballot open. So we have to wait about an hour until we get the results of the first round of voting. Harriet Harman, the former Labour deputy leader, is the final candidate to make her pitch. She says politics is broken. MPs are facing regular threats. So this election is important. These are difficult, even dangerous times for our parliamentary democracy. The country\u2019s divided, the house is divided, the public view of this house is at an all-time low. She says, when she was leader of the Commons, she was fair to all sides. She says the Speaker\u2019s powers must be transparent. And she would be fearless in standing up for the Commons. She says her governing principle would be that all constituents are equal, and that all MPs are equal. She would do her best to ensure that all MPs can do their best. She has not been a member of a minor party in the Commons, she says. So she says she would appoint a fourth deputy speaker, from one of the smaller parties, so their perspective does not get overlooked. She says she has pushed for reform, including the introduction of proxy voting only recently. The Commons was 97% male when she was first elected, she says. She says that has changed enormously. But she says there has only been one female Speaker, Betty Boothroyd (who is watching from the gallery). So, I\u2019m running for Speaker in these difficult times because I have unparalleled experience and an unparalleled record of reform of this house, but there\u2019s one other reason I want your vote. Six hundred years, only ever one woman. There have been 156 men, and this is my question to the house today. Can we show the country we have changed by putting the second woman in that Speaker\u2019s chair? Many MPs are standing down, she says, sometimes only after a short time. That should concern people. She wishes them all well. Addressing Ken Clarke, she says he has been an exemplary parliamentarian. She wants to thank him. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the senior deputy Speaker, goes next. He is seen as the favourite, and he starts by praising Ken Clarke, but telling him that MPs expect to carry on hearing from him when he stands down. He says what matters is that MPs can use parliament to hold the government to account. As deputy Speaker, he has tried to ensure that everyone gets their voice heard. This is not a club where only people who have been here 35 years count. The person who walked through that door yesterday is just as important to their constituents - their voice must be heard as well - and the pecking order ought not to be there, it is about equality. He says the Speaker must be trusted. And they must have proven track record. He hopes people will accept that he has that. And he has shown that you can reduce the time taken for Commons matters, he says. He says security must be improved. But a lot has been done already, he says. He hopes people will credit him for what he has done to ensure that MPs are safe, their families are safe and their staff are safe. He says the chamber is under-used. There are great ideas for how it could be used more. He will not let MPs down, and he will be accountable. Meg Hillier, the Labour chair of the public accounts committee, is making her case now. She says she would be a Speaker who spoke less, but who, when she did speak, would be there to speak up for MPs. She would be an impartial Speaker. UQs and statements are allowed to go on for too long, she says. I would be an impartial Speaker, a director rather than an actor and we want better time keeping. She says she used to be mayor of a London borough. She had a casting vote, and had to handle some tricky situations. She says MPs know her as someone who can be discreet. I am not a grandstanding politician, I would speak little and as many of you know, I\u2019m incredibly discreet when you come to see me about matters in your constituency. And I would not seek self-publicity but speak up only for MPs and for parliament and our democracy. She says, on the restoration and renewal project, she was the MP who tabled the amendment saying MPs should move out of the building while the work goes on. She says bullying and harassment is still too rife in this building. There are good MPs to work for and bad MPs to work for. Some members of staff are afraid to raise concerns about how they are treated. She says the Commons needs better HR. This must be addressed now, she says. I\u2019d step up the approach to personal security and online bullying which is leading to too many colleagues leaving this place because it\u2019s intolerable. But the main thrust of why I\u2019m standing is the bullying and harassment that is still too rife in this building. Dame Eleanor Laing, another deputy Speaker, goes next. She thanks Ken Clarke for his service to the Commons. She says the Commons is full of good people. She is very sad that so many MPs have decided to leave. It is time someone had the courage to defend MPs, not just in his house but outside as well, she says. She says that is what she would do as Speaker. Defending members of parliament, that\u2019s what I would do if the House makes me Speaker. Because failing to stand up for the honourable men and women who come to this place to their public duty harms not only the individual MP but weakens parliament in the eyes of the nation. There is a real anxiety about the health to the democratic system, she says. She says there is a need to rebuild trust in the political system. This is a time for change, she says, and she would deliver change. There are times for continuity and there are times for change. This is the time for change. I want to be that change. This the 21st century for goodness sake, we need to escape from the overbearing and hierarchal structures that have made it all too easy for a culture of bullying to take route. She says there must be an end to bullying in the Commons. She has always discharged her duties with kindness, she says. She says the Speaker must support the welfare of MPs. And she says the Speaker should not say any more than needs to be said. And the Speaker should not be taking up the time that should be there for MPs. Can I just say that it\u2019s not the role of the Speaker to say any more than needs to be said. Sir Edward Leigh, a Conservative, is speaking now. He says he would want to encourage backbenchers who are sincere in their beliefs. He says he thinks the Speaker should submerge his personality into the job. He should be a servant of the house, he says. He says Winterton and Bryant were proposing the same idea in their speeches. I think the Speaker should submerge his or her character in the job. The Speaker should be the servant of the house, the Speaker should be a dignified and quiet voice. MPs should be proud of what the Commons has achieved in the last three years, he says. Every point of view has been aired, he says. They should recreate the great debates in this place, he says. Everyone should get a fair crack of the whip, he says. I believe that we can make this place even better - I believe that it\u2019s no accident that the great speeches in history in our place were precisely that, speeches. They were not interminable self-regarding points of intervention or points of order or statements going on forever. I believe that we should recreate the great debates in this place and allow adequate time and be fair to everybody, so that everybody gets a fair crack of the whip, literally to put their point of view. He says it is also important for MPs to maintain the building properly. He says the restoration can be down cheaply and efficiently. He says he does not support the need for Richmond House to be gutted to home a replacement chamber. He urges MPs to hold the executive to account, and to be sincere in their beliefs. The Labour MP Chris Bryant goes next. He says he loves parliament. He says much good work goes on here that is not appreciated. MPs work together on campaigns that make a real difference, he says. He says he wants to restore the rulebook. It is important for the Speaker to know it backwards, he says. He says he sleeps with Erskine May at his bedside. I\u2019m standing because I love parliament, I believe in parliamentary democracy and I want to do things properly - that means being a Speaker who has absolutely no favourites, a Speaker who believes in standing by the rules, somebody who is completely impartial, who knows Erskine May inside out, back to front, I\u2019ve got it lying by my bedside. He says he wants to get PMQs back to 30 minutes. He would publish lists of speakers for debates, so that MPs know when they will be called, he says. He says he wants to stop clapping in the chamber. He ends by saying he just wants the chance to serve. Dame Rosie Winterton, a deputy speaker, goes first. She says she has been a chief whip (for Labour) and a deputy Speaker. Restoring public confidence in parliament is all our responsibility, but the Speaker sets the tone. My view is the Speaker\u2019s job is not to dominate proceedings or speak for parliament but to facilitate debate and allow parliament to speak for itself with all its different voices and all its diverse voices. She says in every job she has done she has been conciliatory. She says, as a Speaker from the north, she would show the House of Commons is open to all. And she says the last Speaker from the north (Betty Boothroyd) did a good job. As Speaker I would douse the flames not pour petrol on them. A stabilising, unifying Speaker, a Speaker from the north so the public see parliament is about the whole country and not just London. She says she does not like to see speakers at the end of debates being given just three minutes to finish speeches. She says urgent questions and PMQs should not be allowed to over-run. (That marks a contrast with John Bercow, who regularly let UQs and PMQs run until everyone down to ask a question had had a go.) She says he father was a headteacher. He was not seen as a disciplinarian. He was seen as \u201cfair, encouraging and trusted\u201d, she says. She says she would like to be the same as Speaker. She would \u201cnot seek the limelight\u201d, but build trust. In the Commons MPs have just started the debate to choose a new Speaker. Ken Clarke, the father of the Commons, is chairing proceedings. He said all seven candidates would make a five-minute speech. He said he drew lots this morning to decide the order in which they would speak. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, has been speaking at at Westminster event where he is unveiling Brexit party election candidates. He says his party will not be standing aside for the Tories. John Woodcock, who was elected as Labour MP for Barrow and Furness but who left the party last year, has announced that he won\u2019t stand again for election because he and his partner, the Spectator journalist Isabel Hardman, are having a baby. He has children by his previous partner now living in Edinburgh and, as he explains in an open letter to his constituents, he thinks his new family circumstances would make continuing as an MP for a Cumbria seat impossible. Woodcock strongly criticised Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s handling of antisemitism allegations when he resigned from the Labour party, although at the time he was also facing a misconduct allegation himself. In his letter Woodcock says he had been looking forward to defending his seat as an independent. But his chances of re-election would have been minimal. Independents very rarely win in UK parliamentary elections, and in 2017 Woodcock had a majority of just 209 over the Tories. The number of deaths in Northern Ireland linked to paramilitary activity has increased year on year, a new report has found. The Independent Reporting Commission, which was set up to monitor progress on the peace process in the region, also says that Brexit could fuel further violence. \u201cThe real issue about the dangers for peace in Northern Ireland, therefore, is not that Brexit itself could be the direct cause of a renewal of violence, but rather that it has the potential to add fuel to the fire of continued paramilitarism,\u201d it said in its second annual report. It said that while the level of paramilitary violence over the last 10 years had reduced, it was \u201cdisturbing\u201d to see three paramilitary-linked deaths in the year to 20 September including the murder of journalist Lyra McKee. It found that loyalist paramilitaries were responsible for more assaults and republican paramilitaries were involved in more shootings. There are 88 organised crime groups in Northern Ireland, 22 of which have paramilitary links, it says. Jack Irvine, the veteran public relations specialist who has been taken on by the Brexit party for the election (see 12.25pm), has said he agrees with its criticisms of Boris Johnson\u2019s deal \u201c100%\u201d. In a brief email exchange following news of his appointment, Irvine said the party had hired him on a Media House contract \u201cbut I will be working seven days a week\u201d for it. Asked whether he endorsed its policies, he said: I agree with the Brexit party 100% especially on issues of sovereignty, fishing rights and regaining legal independence. I also believe that Boris has failed to deliver a genuine Brexit and am appalled at the treatment of our Northern Irish friends and relations. Plaid chose the same setting for its election campaign launch as it plumped for in 2017 \u2013 a hotel close to the Menai Bridge in north Wales. But the tone and message was very different. Two years ago the slogan was \u201cDefending Wales\u201d - against what Plaid saw as the Tories\u2019 indifference and the Labour-led Welsh government\u2019s incompetence. Plaid\u2019s ultimate goal \u2013 independence \u2013 hardly got a look-in. This time the new Plaid leader, Adam Price, who took over from Leanne Wood last year, went on the attack - and put independence front and centre. He argued that this was the time for the people of Wales to find their voice and insist that they shape their future as an independent country within the EU. Plaid\u2019s ambition for Wales to break away from the UK has been boosted by marches for independence in Wales that have attracted thousands. Its slogan this time round is: \u201cWales, it\u2019s us.\u201d Price\u2019s speech was typically passionate and colourful. At one point he seemed to be pinching a sound bite from the Star Wars movies, speaking about \u201ca new hope for all of us.\u201d He also pointed out that 11 December [1282] was the day Wales lost its independence. This year 12 December could be the start of a new push back towards independence, he claimed. The speech was full of aspiration \u2013 a green jobs revolution, better support for children who are in poverty, more affordable homes, a separate Welsh legal system. And there was also a reaching out from Plaid\u2019s leader in Westminster, Liz Saville Roberts, towards voters who tend not to back the nationalists - including English people who live in Wales. \u201cWe are the party for Wales and everyone who lives there,\u201d she said. \u201cIf Wales is in your heart we are the party for you.\u201d Sinn Fein has announced it will not stand in three constituencies in Northern Ireland in a bid to prevent DUP MPs winning the seats. The party will stand aside in South Belfast, East Belfast and North Down. As the Press Association reports, Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald urged supporters to instead back the SDLP, the Alliance party and independent unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon respectively in those three seats. Announcing the move, McDonald said: In many ways this is a once-in-a-generation election, the stakes are very high in this election. People have a fundamental choice to make - to vote for a positive, inclusive future or to turn their backs on that and to back candidates who have been the architects of Brexit and who have acted very, very deliberately against the democratic wishes of people here in the north and more fundamentally against the economic and social interests of citizens who live here. You can call this a pact, you can call it what you wish - the reality is we are asking people to come out and vote for those pro-Remain candidates. We believe that is the right and progressive thing to do. What is novel, and striking, about today\u2019s announcement is the plan for Sinn Fein to stand aside to help Lady Sylvia Hermon. Hermon now sits as an independent, but she is a unionist, she was first elected to parliament as an Ulster Unionist party MP and she is the widow of Sir Jack Hermon, a former chief constable of the RUC. Karen Bradley, the former Northern Ireland secretary, was widely mocked last year when she admitted that, before she took on the job, she did not realise that nationalists in Northern Ireland don\u2019t vote for unionists. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand things like when elections are fought, for example, in Northern Ireland \u2013 people who are nationalists don\u2019t vote for unionist parties and vice versa,\u201d she said. She was deemed ignorant because for years in Northern Ireland the unionist/nationalist divide has trumped everything. But today\u2019s announcement from Sinn Fein shows that in some parts of Northern Ireland (but not all - see my colleague Rory Carroll at 12.30pm) these rigidities are starting to crack. Asked if she was comfortable about asking Sinn Fein supporters to back a unionist in North Down, McDonald replied: It sits very comfortably with me to ask and invite voters to thoughtfully do the right thing. And in this case it means defying hard Brexiteers, the likes of Nigel Dodds, the likes of the DUP candidates who have very, very recklessly acted against the interests of everybody. Whether you call yourself a unionist or a nationalist, a republican or a loyalist, we actually have many, many interests in common. From my colleague Jennifer Rankin The SNP is making the same claims about how a post-Brexit trade deal with the US could threaten the NHS that the Labour party is making. This is what Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister and the SNP leader, said in a statement this morning ahead of a campaign visit to Rutherglen, South Lanarkshire. Boris Johnson is desperate to do a post-Brexit trade deal with Donald Trump which will undoubtedly include prescription drug prices and corporate access to the NHS. The threat to our NHS shows why Scotland needs to escape the Westminster chaos and choose our own future. Far from getting Brexit done, if the Tories get to pass their deal, it will just be the start of the damage to our economy and public services like our precious NHS. On the visit Sturgeon also told journalists that she objected to the idea of election debates being limited to the Conservatives and Labour, as ITV is proposing for one of its debates. She said: The population, certainly in Scotland, but across the rest of the UK, is moving away from the two-party system. You\u2019ve got the broadcasters not only sticking to that but actually going back the way, because in 2010, 2015 and 2017 they had a different approach to that. My message to the broadcaster is make sure that you\u2019re reflecting politics as it is and not just how you want it to be. Loathing of Brexit united remainers and finally broke Northern Ireland\u2019s binary nationalist v unionist divide. Well, so it seemed for a few heady days. Last week Steve Aiken, the incoming leader of the Ulster Unionist party (UUP), upended convention by ruling out an electoral pact with the Democratic Unionist party (DUP). As an opponent of Brexit Aiken said he felt duty-bound to run candidates in all 18 constituencies to give pro-remain unionists an alternative to the DUP. Even in north Belfast, he said. Meaning Aiken was willing to split the unionist vote and give Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s John Finucane a better chance of taking the seat from the DUP\u2019s deputy leader, Nigel Dodds. An audacious move that prompted swift backlash. Unionists inside and outside the UUP protested. Suspected loyalist paramilitaries threatened retaliation against the UUP. At the weekend Aiken caved and said his party would skip north Belfast, giving Dodds, the DUP\u2019s Brexit policy architect, a clear run at sweeping up unionists, be they leavers or remainers. The DUP, in turn, will give the UUP a clear run in the marginal seat of Fermanagh and south Tyrone. The moderate nationalist SDLP then announced it too would stand aside in north Belfast to boost Finucane\u2019s chances. (See 12pm.) The stated reason is to let remain voters rally around a single candidate, even one who would abstain from Westminster. The other reason is to pressure Sinn F\u00e9in to stand aside in south Belfast and boost the SDLP\u2019s chance of nabbing the seat from the DUP. Unionism and nationalism, remain and leave, all simmering together in a Northern Irish stew. The Brexit party has appointed a Scottish public relations specialist and former tabloid editor, Jack Irvine, as its head of campaign communications for the general election campaign. The launch editor of the Scottish edition of the Sun in 1987, Irvine describes himself as an expert in crisis management and public affairs, telling one interviewer with the trade magazine PR Week: \u201cPeople come to me because I\u2019m combative and aggressive.\u201d Irvine set up the Glasgow-based PR firm MediaHouse in 1991, after management jobs for Mirror Group, owners of the Daily Record, and News International. Its clients in Scotland include Scottish Land &amp; Estates, the landowners group, grouse moor owners, the Bank of Scotland, the football club Rangers FC and Sir Brian Souter, the co-founder of the Stagecoach transport company during Souter\u2019s unsuccessful campaign to retain regulations which banned \u201cpromotion\u201d of gay rights in schools. His firm has expanded overseas, with Irvine campaigning in the US on an alleged fraud case involving Medicare and a medical laboratory, but he has also acted for Caribbean tax havens, including the government of the Cayman Islands, the British Virgin Islands and Turks and Caicos. Irvine has been approached for a comment on his new role. It is unclear whether he has taken the job on in a personal or professional capacity. His MediaHouse profile page reports: Irvine has carved out a niche in crisis management and public affairs and in that role deals almost exclusively with chairmen and chief executives both in Europe and the USA. The past decade has seen an increasing advisory role for Irvine with political leaders in international financial centres. And here is another question from BTL. When will we get the final result of the election for the new Speaker? My colleague Peter Walker has got an overall guide to the process here. There are now seven candidates. The election starts at 2.30pm and all the candidates will get the chance to deliver a short speech before MPs vote in a secret ballot. Commons officials says it could take up to an hour to count the papers, and so we should get the first set of results at around 4.30pm. MPs use an exhaustive ballot and, after the first round of voting, the candidate with the fewest votes drops out and MPs keep voting until someone gets more than 50% of votes cast. This means in theory there could be up to five rounds of voting. But any candidate with less than 5% of votes cast also drops out, and in practice candidates who realise they are not going to win also tend to quit voluntarily. In 2009, when MPs last elected a Speaker, there were 10 candidates but only three rounds of voting. It would be surprising if it goes beyond that this time, and so the final result should come by around 6.30pm. But it could be nearer 5.30pm if the second round of voting settles the matter. Here is Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament\u2019s lead Brexit spokesman, on Nigel Farage\u2019s decision not to stand for Westminster. Farage, of course, remains an MEP. The SDLP has announced it will not stand in three constituencies in Northern Ireland in a bid to facilitate pro-remain candidates, the Press Association reports. The nationalist party will not put forward candidates in North and East Belfast and in North Down as it attempts to prevent DUP Brexiters winning those seats. The move in North Belfast will give Sinn F\u00e9in candidate John Finucane a better chance of unseating the DUP deputy leader and longstanding MP, Nigel Dodds, who has a majority of just over 2,000. The Ulster Unionist party has already stepped aside in North Belfast to give Dodds a better chance of winning, PA reports. The UUP decision also proved controversial, as it came only a week after the incoming leader, Steve Aiken, pledged to run in all 18 constituencies in Northern Ireland. The SDLP move in East Belfast is designed to give the Alliance party leader, Naomi Long, a better chance of defeating incumbent DUP MP, Gavin Robinson, while in North Down it is hoping that independent unionist and pro-remain MP Lady Sylvia Hermon can see off a DUP challenge to unseat her, PA reports. If remainers are looking for reasons to vote Labour, Lib Dem or SNP, the Tories have got a helpful clock at CCHQ that will give them one. This is from the Tory MP Harriett Baldwin. Adam Price, the Plaid Cymru leader, has finished his speech at his election launch, and the Facebook live feed is over. This is what he said about the choice facing the people of Wales. In calling the third election in just four years the Westminster parties certainly have given the people the worst Christmas present ever. A political culture that is more toxic than at any time in our history, a poisoned chalice of a choice between two divided parties led by one leader who is resolutely dishonest on Brexit and another who is sadly proven, honestly, clueless. And both of them, as we\u2019ve seen in recent days, advised by public schoolboys who seem to see politics as some kind of pathological game. Price seems to be referring to the publicity for this Channel 4 Dispatches programme going out tonight. Price also said that at this election Wales should break with a century of backing Westminster parties. He said: At this election we can break with the tradition of a century of Westminster elections in Wales. Wales has overwhelmingly backed Westminster parties, Labour above all else, in all that time. But what has been the return of that investment of trust and loyalty the people of Wales have put in the Westminster parties? We are at the wrong end of every league table you care to mention, at the end of a long queue for government investment, with a worse funding settlement and fewer of the economic levers, over tax and borrowing, that have been given to Northern Ireland and Scotland. Price says Plaid Cymru is Wales\u2019s leading remain party. It wants to lead Wales to remain, and then lead it into becoming an independent member of the European Union in its own right. Price says Scotland\u2019s needs have shot to the top of the political agenda because of devolution and the strength of the SNP. The biggest legacy for Wales has been what has been cancelled: a power station, and rail electrification. He says Wales has some of the best renewable energy resources. But it does not even feature in Labour\u2019s clean energy plans. Adam Price, the leader of Plaid Cymru, is speaking at the Plaid election campaign launch now. He is speaking in a mix of English and Welsh, but there is no translation on the live feed I\u2019m using, so some of it I cannot follow. Price says an election at December is the worst Christmas ever. He says voters have a choice between someone who is dishonest, and someone who is clueless. And they are both advised by public schoolboys who see politics as a game, he says. He says the best future for Wales would be as an independent, prosperous nation. There has to be a better way, he says. He says at this election Plaid can break with a century of tradition. For the last 100 years Wales has backed the main parties. But what has Wales gained from that? It is at the wrong end of every league table that matters. Plaid Cymru is launching its general election campaign. There is a live feed here. Here is a question from a reader BTL (below the line). Could the UK leave the EU before 31 January? In theory, yes. Here is an extract from the official EU statement (pdf) agreeing the extension. If parliament were to pass the Brexit deal in time, the UK could leave the EU on 1 January. It says: The European council recalls that, under article 50(3) TEU, the withdrawal agreement may enter into force on an earlier date, should the parties complete their respective ratification procedures before the end of the period under article 50(3) TEU. Consequently, the withdrawal should take place on the first day of the month following the completion of the ratification procedures or on 1 February 2020, whichever is the earliest. In an interview with the Sun on Sunday, Boris Johnson suggested that, in the event of the Tories winning the election, Brexit could happen by Christmas. The story started: Boris Johnson has revealed his \u201cfast and furious\u201d plan to get Brexit wrapped up by Christmas if he wins a decisive general election victory on December 12. But the actual quote from Johnson was a bit less specific. He told the paper: We\u2019ve got a deal that\u2019s ready to go and if we can get it right with a new parliament we will move quickly. Our new MPs will come back the following day and we will bang it through. We\u2019ll get Brexit done very, very fast and avoid another infinite period of dither and delay. And, in practice, Johnson\u2019s \u201cBrexit by Christmas\u201d pledge will probably turn out to be as reliable as his \u201cdo or die\u201d one to deliver Brexit by 31 October because it is very hard to imagine the Brexit agreement being passed before Christmas. MPs will not be able to return to the Commons \u201cthe following day\u201d after the election because the counting will not finish in some constituencies until late Friday. Then, when MPs do return to the Commons at the start of a new parliament, it normally takes a few days for them all to take the oath before any legislating can actually start. And even if Johnson were able to ram the withdrawal agreement bill through parliament before Christmas, the European parliament would also have to vote to rubber-stamp it for the UK to be able to leave on 1 January. UPDATE: Sorry. I got sidetracked, and overlooked the point about a no-deal Brexit. No deal is now off the table until 31 January. The extension agreement means that, under international law, the UK is now a member of the EU until the end of January, unless a deal is agreed by the end of December, and UK law has also been amended to reflect this. And here is Jennifer\u2019s full story about Jean-Claude Juncker criticising Boris Johnson for telling \u201cso many lies\u201d during the 2016 referendum campaign. Jean-Claude Juncker, the outgoing president of the European commission, has said in an interview that Boris Johnson lied during the 2106 referendum campaign, my colleague Jennifer Rankin reports. If you are looking for evidence of lies and untruths told during the 2016 referendum, the Labour MP Richard Corbett has a good list on his website here. (The remain campaign was generally more honest, but it wasn\u2019t perfect, and the claim that a vote to leave would trigger the need for an emergency, tax-raising budget was particularly spurious.) In a phone-in with LBC this morning Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons and leading Brexiter, said that Nigel Farage should \u201cretire from the field\u201d because he had already achieved his lifelong ambition to deliver Brexit. Rees-Mogg claimed that, by standing against the Tories at the election, the Brexit party could end up snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. Rees-Mogg said: I think [Farage] would be well-advised to recognise that that battle he won. He should be really proud of his political career. It would be a great shame if he carries on fighting after he has already won to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. I understand why Nigel Farage would want to carry on campaigning because he has been campaigning for the best part of 30 years and it must be hard to retire from the field. But that is what he ought to do. In an interview with ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, played down suggestions that by standing candidates all over Britain, his party would damage the Tories more than Labour. He said his party would \u201churt the Labour party in the most extraordinary way\u201d. He said: I led Ukip into the 2015 general election. I had all the same stuff, all the same arguments. The Tory tribe screaming and shouting, \u2018Don\u2019t take our votes\u2019. The Ukip vote took more votes from Labour than it did from the Conservatives, [David] Cameron wouldn\u2019t have even got a majority without Ukip. We are going to hurt the Labour party in the most extraordinary way. We\u2019ll do it in South Wales, we\u2019ll do it in the Midlands, we\u2019ll do it in the north of England. Those Labour voters have been completely betrayed by the Labour party. They are my number one target. I got those votes in 2015, I\u2019ll do it again. Farage\u2019s analysis is not generally shared by election experts, who have been arguing that it is the Conservatives who will lose out most from having Brexit party candidates on the ballot. In his interview Farage also defended his decision not to stand as a candidate himself. As my colleagues Simon Murphy and Liz Perkins report here, Francesca O\u2019Brien is being urged to stand down as the Conservative candidate in Gower after it emerged that five years ago she wrote a post on Facebook saying people on the reality TV show Benefits Street needed \u201cputting down\u201d. Gower, a Labour-held marginal, is one of the Tories\u2019 key targets in Wales. In her Today interview Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, the work and pensions secretary, refused to back calls for O\u2019Brien to be removed as a candidate. Coffey said that O\u2019Brien\u2019s comment was \u201cclearly wrong\u201d, but that she had apologised and that it should be up to the people of the Gower to decide if they wanted her as an MP. Ian Lavery, the Labour party chair, said Coffey should have disowned her candidate. In a statement he said: Removing a candidate who used such vile language about people on benefits should be a no brainer. The cuts to benefits and universal credit programme that Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey and her party are responsible for have forced people into poverty. It is shameful that Boris Johnson is allowing Francesca O\u2019Brien to stand for his party in Gower. This reveals the Conservatives\u2019 contempt for the less well off. Brexit is at risk because of Nigel Farage\u2019s decision to put up Brexit party candidates against the Tories, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, the work and pensions secretary, told the Today programme this morning. She said: The Conservative party is the party that will get Brexit done. I cannot understand how Nigel Farage puts at risk ... being the person who lets Brexit evaporate. Only the Conservative party, in this election, of the parties that have the chance of being in government, are the only party that is going to respect the referendum of 2016. The election campaign has only just started but already senior figures in the health service are expressing alarm at the way that the NHS is being used as a \u201cpolitical weapon\u201d in the campaign. The NHS is always a key election issue, of course, but there are at least two reasons why it is set to be more salient than usual this year. First, we are having an unusual December election, which means hospitals are under more pressure than they are when people normally go to the polls in the spring. And, second, this is an election where both main parties think they can win on health. Normally the Tories cede this issue to Labour, but Boris Johnson has decided to put the NHS at the top of his agenda (he believes that the Vote Leave bus slogan means he is obliged to champion health spending) and some polling shows that he is trusted more on health than Jeremy Corbyn, which is an unusual feat for a Tory leader. In an article in the Times (paywall) Carrie MacEwen, chairwoman of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, says that any public debate about the NHS needs to be based on \u201crealistic expectations\u201d and that the general election makes this unlikely. She says: We have already had a taste of what may be ahead. Labour has claimed that a nationalised drugs company would \u201cmake medicines cheaper\u201d. But who is going to fund the research for new drugs? The Conservatives claimed \u201cfunding for 40 new hospitals\u201d, making it disappointing to learn that in fact money had been allocated to just six. This is easy electioneering aimed at a soft target. Undeliverable promises simply set the NHS up to fail. And this is at a time when it is actually on a long-overdue path to success. And in an article for the Times\u2019 Red Box website (paywall) Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals and other health trust organisations, makes a similar point. He says having the NHS as a dominant election issue could be counterproductive. He explains: This political potency is often helpful for the NHS. But it becomes counter-productive when the NHS is used as a political weapon. Frontline NHS leaders are worried that is already starting to happen in this election. Of course we need to be open and honest about where the health service is falling short. It is clear that, despite treating many more patients than ever before, the NHS is falling back against key targets for A and E, cancer care and diagnostic tests. Waiting lists for operations have climbed to nearly four and a half million and the pressures on our mental health, community and ambulance services are just as great. However hard the NHS frontline works, it can\u2019t seem to keep up with growing demand. This is particularly worrying with winter looming. But as pressures on the NHS intensify in the coming weeks, over-dramatising or distorting the difficulties for political ends will do nothing to help those frontline staff who are working flat out for patients. Equally, disingenuous claims about extra funding, or promises that create unrealistic expectations, may be tempting in the heat of the election battle, but they do the health service no favours. These are understandable arguments, but there seems to be little chance of their having much impact on the campaign. Rightly or wrongly, electioneering is always drawn towards hyperbole. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, and Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, meet NHS staff at Unison HQ in London. 10.30am: Adam Price, the Plaid Cymru leader, and Liz Saville Roberts, its leader at Westminster, launch Plaid\u2019s election campaign. 2pm: Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, unveils the party\u2019s 600 election candidates. 2.30pm: MPs start the process of electing a new Speaker. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing mostly on general election developments and on the election of a new Speaker. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
