Not Kaira! I really liked Kaira. Naresh, you total monster. We must assume, I think, from the positioning of the bullet that this time Kaira really is dead. Although I said that about Naresh last week and he turned out not to be dead at all. So maybe there is a small hope for Kaira if a neurosurgeon adept at removing bullets from brains can be found at short notice. No? Thought not. Anyway, what a horrible ending. I am going to have nightmares. Why, Aafrin, with all your double dealings and insider knowledge, could you not have patented a bulletproof sari? I can\u2019t bear it. This was a fast-paced, quality episode which allowed me to retain my optimism that this series will be better than the first. Slowness dulled last year\u2019s offering for me. Is it even possible, though, that they\u2019ve taken things so far that it\u2019s all now moving a bit (whisper it) too fast? Some of the scenes here could have been longer. There was an awful lot of cutting between storylines. Some of this was done, I\u2019m sure, as a plot catching-up device for Johnny-come-lately second-season viewers: \u201cIs the houseboy your son?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d Well, that\u2019s that sorted for anyone who was wondering. The action was cleverly balanced between old scores and new narrative threads. And what a joy to see James Fleet as Lord Hawthorne, a triple whammy of an addition: a) a great actor b) a great character (and easily a future contender for Evil Britisher of the Week if he sticks around) and c) a great trick to make Lord Hawthorne not Ralph\u2019s nemesis at all but his helpmate, permitting a scene that neatly encapsulated the entire point of series two, especially designed for any of the Johnny-come-latelys who might have been nodding off. Next time, Lord Hawthorne, wear a T-shirt that says: \u201cIndia might be getting independence soon. And what on Earth will happen to Ralph then?\u201d There\u2019s still a feeling, though, that things are being established. Nothing has quite taken off yet. It\u2019s all set-up and no punchline. (Except for Kaira, of course. Although it was always going to be her or Naresh.) At some point I might need some of Aafrin\u2019s father\u2019s heart medicine \u2013 the potential for suspense is piling up intolerably. Alice is near breaking point. Miss Prasad is surely likely to do something highly ill-advised, if the once-beardy teacher man doesn\u2019t do it first. Aafrin\u2019s sister is likely to blow up her family with an exploding cake rather than marry anyone called Bumman. (\u201cWhy won\u2019t you say hello to Bumman?\u201d Er, because his name is Bumman? Sorry if I\u2019ve spelled his name wrong. But really.) The Bumman scene was actually the most entertaining of this series so far. When Indian Summers gives itself room to breathe, there is some lovely dialogue. \u201cI\u2019d like to hear the other issue ...\u201d \u201cDo you know ... I\u2019d quite like some cake ...\u201d Cue much irritation about how many people would be required to help with the cake. Then the father: \u201cI\u2019ll help.\u201d Split-second pause. \u201cIt\u2019s a big cake.\u201d Political shenanigans \u201cViceroys do tend to come from the aristocracy ...\u201d This could be the subtitle for Indian Summers, since this series is not really about India or summers or the end of empire but the fate of one man: Ralph Whelan. Or, at least, I hope it is. I\u2019m worried that Ralph\u2019s destiny \u2013 which needs to be the lynchpin of this drama to keep us interested \u2013 is getting lost. He needs to shine as the main character. I\u2019m not sure he did here. Ralph should not be a bit player. (Ooh, I\u2019m sounding like Cynthia. It\u2019s catching.) I appreciated Ralph spelling out the options here, even if it was all a bit \u201cPeter and Jane go to India.\u201d \u201cSay we place India on the same footing as Australia and Canada ... Self-rule for India ...\u201d Yeah, like that\u2019s ever going to happen. Ah, well, in that case: \u201cLet me be the one who knew how to leave.\u201d Evil Britisher of the week \u201cEvery time I see him, I want to rip out his throat.\u201d You said it, Ralph. When it comes to creeps, Alice\u2019s not-dead-after-all husband Charlie takes the passive-aggressively buttered scone. At the risk of repeating myself, Blake Ritson was born for these roles. He so looks, lives and breathes the part that it\u2019s as if he is not acting but has time-travelled. I love the suggestion of utter psychopathology lurking beneath the aristocratic exterior. (It\u2019s never far buried, people.) And is there anything more chilling that a casually stored lock-culling kit that you pop out of your pocket on a whim? \u201cHold still, Muddle!\u201d Matched only by the casual racism of his Al Jolson impression with the \u201cCamptown Ladies\u201d and the ugly grimace of his laugh when Miss Prasad was being made to curtsey. Evil Britishness at its most sublime: \u201cWe do get experimental when drink is taken.\u201d (Those wondering, by the way, if Charlie is also somehow secretly responsible for the removal of my predecessor of this blog, Rhik Samadder ... You\u2019re not that wide of the mark. Not that I\u2019m trying to cover my tracks.) Julie Walters Fan Club It was all jingle-jangle earrings and embroidered kaftans this week, as if Virginia Woolf had wandered into a recording of The Archers. Love it. From last week\u2019s comments, though, I sense I may be a bit lonely at the bar of the Julie Walters Fan Club. (It\u2019s a bar where drinks are free. Fun and sunshine, there\u2019s enough for everyone.) A lot of people seem to be watching her in a \u201clove-to-hate\u201d way in this series. Why? There\u2019s a feeling the accent isn\u2019t right, the performance is hammy, it\u2019s all a bit over-the-top. But these are exactly all the reasons I love Cynthia (and Julie). The accent is messy because Cynthia is hiding who she really is: it\u2019s not natural for her to talk posh and sometimes she slips out of it. Cynthia herself is a character and a bit of a ham: she\u2019s a music-hall turn made good. She\u2019s over-the-top because she (Cynthia) is acting a part. And the beauty of it is that the mask is always about to slip: \u201cI know what a char is.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
