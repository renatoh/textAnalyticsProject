The 29-year-old loose forward, who was appointed captain when Andy Farrell moved to rugby union early in 2005 but has only led his country for 18 minutes in the subsequent 10 Tests because of a series of injuries, revealed to the Guardian yesterday that his forthcoming autobiography will confirm the end of his international career. \"I phoned Tony Smith [the Great Britain coach] last week to tell him that I'd be finishing,\" said Sculthorpe, who has won 26 Lions caps since making his debut as a teenager in Papua New Guinea in 1996, in addition to playing four World Cup games for England. \"It's tough because I was vice- captain to Faz for so long, and you could never get him to miss a game. Everybody wants to captain their country and it was a big honour for me to get the job. It's just been bad luck that I never got a real run at it. It's been a bit of a jinx for me.\" Sculthorpe insists his decision was made before he suffered his most painful injury blow, a ruptured Achilles sustained in training last month which ended his hopes of leading St Helens into the first Challenge Cup final at the new Wembley. \"I'd made my decision much earlier in the year, but I wanted to announce it when I was playing well. I want to play for as long as possible and this is the best way to squeeze out a few more seasons.\" Sculthorpe, who is due a testimonial at Knowsley Road next season and will meet the club's chairman Eamonn McManus later this week in the hope of finalising a new contract, has backed his former vice- captain Jamie Peacock to be his successor for this autumn's home series against New Zealand, and next year's World Cup. For all the reluctant spectating he has done over the last three seasons, including last year's Super League grand final at Old Trafford, he expects to find Saturday's Challenge Cup semi-final against Bradford Bulls his most agonising experience yet. Sculthorpe is confident that Saints can overcome his absence to reach their third final in four years. But that would mean a sideline view of the first rugby league match at the new Wembley, an occasion that had been one of the main targets when he was battling back from his fourth knee operation in the space of two years last winter. \"It's a killer,\" he admitted. \"Obviously you want the boys to go on and do a job, but I'm not looking forward to sitting there at Wembley if they do get through. That's going to be hard.\" He had started to believe that his long injury nightmare was over in June, scoring 86 points from eight consecutive appearances to confirm that his fairytale return from the last of those knee operations - when he collected a try, three goals and the man-of-the-match award in Saints' World Club Challenge victory over Brisbane Broncos - had been more than a last hurrah. Then in a routine training session he collapsed \"in more pain than I've ever felt before\". He knew his season had ended prematurely, for the third year on the trot, a cruel blow for a player who remains the only man to have won the Man of Steel in consecutive seasons. But after calling time on his international career, he remains determined to fight back.
