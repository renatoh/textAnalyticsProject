Schoolchildren driven inside by the rain are not easy to teach. We had wet play all yesterday so my class spent break and lunch cooped up in the classroom with toys. Today it was more of the same. I arrived, a drowned rat, buzzing because it was Assessment Day. The class was buzzing with cooped-up energy. Please be good, I begged them. We've got a visitor who'll be checking up on us. They were good. They're a great class. But noise and fidgeting levels were high. I did my best but somehow I couldn't even get the overhead projector working properly. The children - seven- to eight-year-olds this term - volunteered their assistance. They wowed us in text level work with their knowledge of characterisation, but somehow word level work didn't go so well. Introducing rules for plurals without exposing them to the hundreds of irregular ones isn't easy. Following another wet play break I had my review. Why hadn't the assessor come yesterday or any other day when the literacy hour had gone really well? But the review went fine. Incredibly, as I read through the pages of notes, it was clear that she thought I'd done a good job and that the children had responded well. There were many useful pointers as to how the lesson could have been improved and we discussed how the training was going and what targets I would set myself over the remainder of this teaching block. It is easy to lose sight of where we are at in our training. We might have a good day, or a lesson that we feel goes particularly well, and our confidence soars. But only until the next day, when we worry about something that doesn't go according to a detailed lesson plan. We are not experienced teachers; we are not even qualified teachers. At this point in the year we are struggling up the steepest learning curve and it is easy to over-react or push ourselves beyond the realms of reality. Despite all the planning, and the weather, and the state of our bank accounts, it is still fun. It is a luxury to be in school in a solid five-week teaching block and I'm sure none of us is looking forward to going back to essays and tutorials during the second half of term. Being in a classroom with children rather than each other is why we've changed careers to teaching, especially when small things make it all worthwhile. This afternoon I taught a 90-minute science lesson on solids. On top of a wet play lunch buzz I had to guide the children as they planned, made and recorded a fair test to see where chocolate buttons melted the fastest - mouth, hands or table. A personal lesson objective was to keep the chocolate buttons around long enough for the results to be recorded accurately. They managed their frustrations brilliantly. I could learn a thing or two from this class."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
