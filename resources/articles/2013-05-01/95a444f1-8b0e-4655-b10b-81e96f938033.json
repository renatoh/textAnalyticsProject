Here's a summary of where things stand: \u2022 The European Union voted to ease an arms embargo on Syria, meaning that the UK and France could begin arming rebel groups \u2013 although such a step was not anticipated before August at least. The US state department said it \"supports\" easing the embargo. \u2022 Russia announced plans to sell anti-aircraft missiles to the Assad regime. Israeli defence minister Moshe Yaalon said the S-300 missile system had not yet left Russia. \"I hope they will not leave, and if, God forbid, they reach Syria, we will know what to do,\" Yaalon said. The US state department called the move a \"mistake,\" but seemed to accept Moscow's explanation that the missiles \"fulfilled existing contracts.\" \u2022 President Obama has asked the Pentagon to draw up a plan for a potential no-fly zone inside Syria, the Daily Beast reported. Other outlets had trouble confirming the report, however. The US has not announced any intention of policing Syrian airspace. \u2022 The US state department condemned Hezbollah fighters' presence in Syria, saying the move is \"destabilizing to Syria but it's destabilizing to Lebanon as well.\" Free Syrian Army commander Salim Idriss warned Hezbollah to remove its fighters from Syria or \"we will take all measures to hunt\" them. \u2022 Medics working in six rebel-held districts near Damascus have treated several hundred fighters for symptoms of chemical exposure since March, a detailed investigation has found, adding fresh impetus to claims the Syrian regime has resorted to the banned weapons. NBC New's Richard Engel has trouble confirming the Daily Beast report about the president requesting new plans from the Pentagon for a potential no-fly zone over Syria: Canada has warned the EU that easing the arms embargo on Syria will only cause \"more deaths,\" Al-Jazeera English reports: Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird said on Tuesday that there would be \"more violence, more deaths and more destruction\" in Syria if the EU goes through with allowing an arms embargo to expire on Saturday. \"My strong view is that the only way to end the suffering of the Syrian people is a political solution,\" he told reporters. \"Flooding the country and the region with more arms will lead to more violence, more deaths and more destruction, so certainly Canada has no intention of following suit,\" he said. Read the full piece here. Josh Rogin of the Daily Beast reports the White House has asked the Pentagon to submit plans for a potential no-fly zone inside Syria. Such a request does not imply a US intention to do so. Rogin's report is based on interviews with two unnamed administration officials: President Obama\u2019s dual-track strategy of continuing to pursue a political solution to the two-year-old uprising in Syria while also preparing for more direct U.S. military involvement includes authorizing the Joint Chiefs of Staff for the first time to plan for multilateral military actions inside Syria, the two officials said. They added that no decisions on actually using force have yet been made. \u201cThe White House is still in contemplation mode but the planning is moving forward and it\u2019s more advanced than it\u2019s ever been,\u201d one administration official told The Daily Beast. \u201cAll this effort to pressure the regime is part of the overall effort to find a political solution, but what happens if Geneva fails? It\u2019s only prudent to plan for other options.\u201d Read the full piece here. (h/t @michaeldweiss) Talks in Istanbul to organize the political leadership of the Syrian opposition under the banner of the Syrian National Coalition are not making much progress, Agence France-Presse reports: A week into marathon talks aimed at presenting a united front on a proposed peace conference, Syria's opposition remains more divided than ever, pulled apart by regional power grabs and unpopular with rebels on the ground. Despite going into several days of overtime at a key meeting in Istanbul, the main Syrian opposition group, the National Coalition, has failed to agree on a whether to join a proposed peace conference aimed at ending a more than two-year civil war that has cost some 94,000 lives. Coalition members and other dissidents say progress at the meeting has been ground to a halt by conflicting bids for influence by Saudi Arabia, which wants to water down the Muslim Brotherhood's strong role in the Coalition, and Qatar, which wants to protect the influential Islamic movement's clout. Amid the bickering, the Coalition has failed to find consensus on whether to join the proposed peace conference in Geneva being pushed by the United States and Russia. \"It is impossible, there will never be an agreement. Each Coalition member is a piece on a chess board, playing for the state that backs him,\" said a dissident who spoke to AFP on condition of anonymity. Full report here. Senator John McCain tweets a picture of himself with members of a rebel group inside Syria. The sign above him advertises a \"new Syria.\" The Assad regime says the EU is obstructing a political settlement by easing its arms embargo, Agence France-Presse reports: Syria\u2019s government on Tuesday slammed an EU decision to lift a ban on supplying arms to rebel fighters as an \u201cobstruction\u201d of efforts to resolve the conflict in the country peacefully. \u201cThe European Union\u2019s decision exposes... its obstruction of international efforts to achieve a political settlement to the crisis in Syria,\u201d the Foreign Ministry said in a statement published by state news agency SANA. The statement also accused the EU of providing \u201csupport and encouragement to terrorists by providing them with weapons in clear violation of international law and the U.N. Charter.\u201d Read the full report here. A critic of the opposition tweets a picture derisively portraying McCain as a Che Guevara figure for his foray into rebel-controlled areas in northern Syria (see update below): Update: An earlier version of this post presumptively referred to @Hussamov11 as a \"regime supporter,\" to which we append this correction, posted with permission: The state department briefing has ended. Acting deputy spokesperson Patrick Ventrell said the United States: \u2022 Supports the easing of the EU arms embargo on Syria, saying the step \"gives the flexibility of specific EU member states to support the opposition as they see fit.\" Easing the embargo sends a message to Assad \"that support for the opposition is only going to increase,\" Ventrell said. \u2022 Will not change its policy based on the EU decision. \"I wouldn't relate the two between an EU decision and our internal decision-making.\" \u2022 Opposes Russian sales of anti-aircraft missiles to the Assad regime. \"We think that's a mistake... They've described it as fulfilling existing contracts... We're going to continue to work with them.\" \u2022 Sees no contradiction in its policy on arms shipments to Syria. \"We've seen how the regime uses these arms. When we're talking about the opposition, that's a different group.\" \u2022 Condemns Hezbollah involvement in Syria. \"It's destabilizing to Syria but it's destabilizing to Lebanon as well.\" \u2022 Ventrell declined to say whether the state department had advance warning of Senator John McCain's visit to Syria Monday. \"We are in touch with various members of Congress about their travel overseas,\" Ventrell said. McCain supports arming the rebels. Guardian Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts asks Ventrell about the state department's opinion of what kind of message the EU decision sends to Assad. Ventrell says the message is \"helpful, because it sends a message to the Assad regime that support for the opposition is only going to increase.\" Ventrell returns to the decision of Russia to supply anti-aircraft missiles to the Assad regime. It sounds as if the state department has accepted a Russian explanation that the missiles were pre-ordered. \"We think that's a mistake,\" Ventrell says. \"They've described it as fulfilling existing contracts... We're going to continue to work with them.\" Ventrell is asked about Hezbollah's expanding role in Syria. \"We're concerned about the dramatic increase of Hezbollah activity. It's destabilizing to Syria but it's destabilizing to Lebanon as well,\" Ventrell says. Ventrell is asked about the killing of three Lebanese soldiers in a cross-border attack. \"We condemn that attack,\" Ventrell says. \"These and other incidents pose a clear danger to Lebanon's stability.\" Then he returns to specific criticism of Hezbollah, saying there has been \"a pretty dramatic escalation of their violence inside neighboring Syria.\" He says the group's fighting in Syria constitutes a \"detriment to the interest and well-being of the Lebanese people.\" Ventrell declines to directly answer a question about whether the State Department knew of Senator John McCain's Memorial Day visit to Syria. \"I'd refer you to his office for more details,\" Ventrell says. But did the White House know about him going? \"We are in touch with various members of Congress about their travel overseas,\" Ventrell says. \"We stay in close touch with members of Congress as they travel overseas...I'm not going to get into specifics with this particular trip.\" The state department briefing begins. Ventrell is asked about the lifting of the EU arms embargo. \"While it is ultimately an EU decision, we do support the easing of the arms embargo,\" he says. But does the administration think it's a good idea? \"We do,\" Ventrell says. \"We believe the step will advance our shared goal... [It also] gives the flexibility of specific EU member states to support the opposition as they see fit.\" Ventrell is asked about Russian intentions to sell anti-aircraft missiles to the Assad regime. \"We have long said that we disagree with and we condemn the continued supply of weapons to the regime,\" he says. But wait: is there no contradiction here, that the US is both for and against new weapons entering Syria? Ventrell says the regime \"uses massive force against civilians.\" \"We condemn all support of arms to the regime,\" he says. \"We've seen how the regime uses these arms. When we're talking about the opposition, that's a different group.\" Ventrell has asked whether the EU announcement has changed US thinking on intervention. \"We haven't made a decision one way or another,\" he says. \"I wouldn't relate the two between an EU decision and our internal decision-making.\" We are waiting for the State Department to begin its afternoon briefing. Acting Deputy Spokesperson Patrick Ventrell is expected to take questions on Syria. You can watch here: Free Syrian Army commander Salim Idriss has warned Hezbollah to remove its fighters from Syria or \"we will take all measures to hunt\" them, \"even in hell.\" Lebanon's An-Nahar newspaper reported on Idriss' remarks on Al-Arabiya: \"If the attacks of Hizbullah against Syrian territory do not stop within 24 hours, we will take all measures to hunt Hizbullah, even in hell,\" he told Al-Arabiya news channel, addressing President Michel Suleiman, Arab League chief Nabil al-Arabi and U.N. chief Ban Ki-Moon. \"I will no longer be bound by any commitments I made, if a decision to stop the attacks... is not taken and implemented,\" said Idriss, who heads the supreme military council of the Free Syrian Army. \"I can no longer restrain the fighters\" of the FSA, he added without saying what concrete action they might take. \"We are being subjected to a genocide conducted by Hizbullah,\" charged Idriss. \"I hope that everyone will excuse the Free (Syrian) Army\" for retaliating, he said.

(Earlier today this blog carried the BBC's report on the massacre.) BAIDA, Syria (Reuters) - Awakened by the sound of gunfire, Ahmad could hear the armed men knocking on his brother's door, shouting insults and calling the family \"dogs\". Ahmad's sister-in-law said the gunmen told her husband to \"bow to your god, Bashar\" -- the Syrian president. She and her husband and their two teenage sons were dragged towards the village square. \"She told me her son's knees were bloodied as they kicked and dragged him,\" Ahmad said. When the violence was over, Ahmad ventured out from his hiding place in an attic. In less than two hours, Baida, his picturesque village near the Mediterranean, had become the scene of one of the worst mass killings in Syria's two-year-old war. Read the full report here. Downing Street has refused to say whether MPs will be given the chance to vote on any decision to send arms to Syria following the EU's decision to lift its arms embargo, the Guardian's Andrew Sparrow reports: The prime minister's spokesman stressed that the government had not taken a decision to arm the Syrian opposition in the light of the EU decision, and indicated that Downing Street hoped that the threat of arms being supplied would persuade the Syrian government to enter negotiations. Asked whether Britain would arm the rebels, the spokesman said: \"The prime minister's view is that it is right that we have the flexibility to respond if [Bashar al-Assad's] regime refused to negotiate. What we are doing is sending a signal, loud and clear, to the regime.\" Syrian peace talks are planned for Geneva next month and the spokesman indicated that Britain wanted the Syrian government to participate. \"What we need is a transitional regime [for Syria] that is supported by both sides, including the [opposition] Syrian National Coalition,\" said the spokesman. As part of that process, Assad would have to go. Read the full dispatch here. White House spokesman Jay Carney has just spoken briefly about Syria with reporters aboard Air Force One, where the president was on his way to New Jersey to mark Hurricane Sandy recovery efforts. Carney said the White House \"welcomes\" European moves to arm rebel groups in Syria, according to initial, unelaborated pool reports. Carney also appeared to reject the potential sale of arms to the Assad regime by Russia, saying it \"does not bring the country closer to the desired political transition.\" Guardian Washington bureau chief Dan Roberts expects a fuller picture of the White House reaction to emerge in a State Department briefing in Washington in about an hour. Dan also flags pool reports of the White House reaction to Senator John McCain's foray into Syria: The administration played down the significance of a surprise visit to Syria by hawkish Republican senator John McCain on Monday. Carney said the White House was aware McCain was planning the trip to see rebel leaders and looked forward to \u201cspeaking to him upon his return\u201d. Over at the Conversation, Middle East expert Professor Rosemary Hollis of City University, London, points out that it is actually \u201cthe so-called \u2018moderate\u2019 rebel forces who need persuading to participate in [the proposed peace] conference if Assad participates\u201d. The rebels' reluctance was yet another factor in the Anglo-French decision to aid the moderate cause. But rather than increasing the chances of effective diplomacy at the anticipated conference, lifting the arms embargo could simply galvanise the rebels in their determination to force Assad from power rather than negotiate with him. Russia\u2019s foreign ministry has released a statement saying that it is \u201cperplexed\u201d by the EU\u2019s failure to renew an arms embargo on the Syrian opposition, writes Alex Winning. Russian officials said they were similarly bewildered by European foreign ministers\u2019 move to extend economic sanctions on Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime, saying that such sanctions are \u201csuffocating the Syrian people\u201d. The statement reminded the EU of a 1970 UN declaration that stipulates that member states shouldn\u2019t fuel, finance or back armed uprisings seeking to overthrow foreign governments. Disputing EU claims that crimes committed by rebel forces \u201cdon\u2019t match the intensity and scale\u201d of those committed by forces loyal to Assad, the foreign ministry pointed to documentary evidence of rebels abusing civilians. \u201cIt is essential to refrain from any comments or actions that could be misinterpreted by the Syrian sides, push them to continue armed confrontation or lead them away from talks,\u201d the statement ended. Here is a summary of today\u2019s key events so far: \u2022 Russia has said it is going to go ahead with a delivery of anti-aircraft missiles to the Syrian government in order to deter \u201chotheads\u201d from getting involved in the country\u2019s civil war. \u2022 The move comes hours after the EU dropped its arms embargo on the Syrian rebels after Britain and France threatened to scupper all embargoes against Syria, which were about to lapse. William Hague, the UK foreign secretary, denied the Russian move was connected to the EU\u2019s. \u2022 Britain and France say they could start supplying arms to the Syrian rebels now if they wanted to, but they don\u2019t yet. Hague said the main aim of the EU move \u2013 which was opposed by the other 25 countries in the union \u2013 was to force Bashar al-Assad to the negotiating table. \u2022 Salam Idris, the commander of the Free Syrian Army umbrella rebel group, and the man Hague named as being a probable conduit of any arms shipment, said he was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d the FSA would not be getting weapons immediately, and said he had run out of patience with the international community. \u2022 Israel condemned Russia\u2019s move, and to a lesser extent Europe\u2019s. It is worried a new influx of weapons could be used against its own cities and citizens. \u2022 Middle East expert Professor Fawaz Gerges of the London School of Economics suggested Russia and Iran \u2013 Assad\u2019s other key backer \u2013 would be keen to see him step down as soon as his seven-year term is up in 2014. He was sceptical about Hague\u2019s theory that the threat of arming the rebels would force Assad to negotiate, and felt it was highly probable that European arms would reach Islamist extremists once they got into Syria. \u2022 Eyewitness testimony and graphic video footage seems to support claims that one of the worst atrocities of the Syrian civil war was carried out in three neighbouring districts in Bayda and Baniyas earlier this month, the BBC reports. \u2022 A Syrian TV correspondent was killed covering the fighting near Qusair yesterday. Yara Abbas, who worked for the state-owned Al-Ikhbariyah TV, was attacked by rebels who ambushed the car carrying her and her crew, the Syrian information ministry said. \u2022 The Lebanese army has said it is investigating the attack on a checkpoint in which three soldiers were killed and its troops are searching for the gunmen. Britain's opposition Labour party have sent a longer response to today's manoeuvrings. They are sceptical about letting the arms embargo lapse. Douglas Alexander, the shadow foreign secretary, described the EU arms embargo as having ended \"because agreement within the member states could not be reached, and because significant disagreement remains about the merits of sending arms to Syria\u2019s opposition\". He added: Russia\u2019s announcement that it will send S-300 anti-aircraft missiles to President Assad further underlines the real risks of this conflict escalating into a regional war by proxy, leading to further suffering for the Syrian people. When he returns to parliament to explain the collapse of the arms embargo, William Hague will face questions from MPs across the Commons who - like other European member states - remain unconvinced by the case he makes. Syria is awash with arms, and today it remains unclear how escalating the conflict with British-supplied weapons would help bring about a peaceful political transition after two years of increasing violence. If the UK government now intends to supply weapons to Syria\u2019s opposition, it must set out to the House of Commons how it will prevent weapons falling into the wrong hands, and how this step will shorten Syria\u2019s civil war rather than prolong it. The French agree with William Hague that they could start supplying arms to the rebels now if they wanted. French foreign ministry spokesman Philippe Lalliot was asked whether Paris could deliver weapons and replied: \u201cYes.\u201d He added: \"Our objective first is to reach a political solution.\u201d A French official also spoke to the Associated Press about the Russian anti-aircraft missiles: Obviously it poses a huge problem for us because if they deliver these weapons - they are ground-to-air missiles - and if we were to set up air corridors, then you can see the contradiction between the two. William Hague\u2019s Radio 4 interview about the EU arms embargo can be heard here (it starts about 15 minutes in). The British foreign secretary said the decision to let the embargo lapse put more pressure on \u201call concerned\u201d to attend the planned peace conference. \u201cAny decision to send arms is for a later stage.\u201d Hague added: We would only send arms to anybody in carefully controlled circumstances, in company with other countries and in accordance with international law. Asked about the weapons reaching Islamist extremist rebels, he said: One of the arguments for sending arms is that at the moment the extremists can get weapons, the regime can get weapons, but if you are of moderate opinion, and you are a citizen of Syria, and every weapon that has ever been invented, except nuclear weapons, is being dropped on your town or village, the world has been denying you the means to defend yourself. And that is radicalising people and driving them to extremism. He said the moderates \u2013 presumably those to whom any weapons would be directed \u2013 were those led by Salam Idriss. Asked about Russia, he said he was working with Moscow on the peace conference, but they didn\u2019t agree with them on everything: \u201cWe don\u2019t approve of Russia\u2019s arms supply to the [Syrian] regime, but they don\u2019t seize that because they are provoking us.\u201d Asked specifically about the S-300 anti-aircraft missiles, he denied it was linked to the EU decision: I\u2019ve never seen any evidence they would change that approach, so that is not surprising and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s related to the decision we\u2019ve made in the European Union. But certainly the long-term supply of weapons to the regime from Russia and other countries has certainly not helped the situation. Hague was asked if it was legal to supply the rebels with arms. \u201cWe would only do anything that is in line with international law,\u201d he said. The Associated Press has been speaking to Salam Idriss, the commander of the Free Syrian Army umbrella rebel group. Idriss says he is \"very disappointed\" that the lifting of the EU arms embargo won't lead to the immediate shipment of weapons to his fighters. He said the Lebanese militia Hezbollah, an ally of the Syrian regime, has thousands of fighters in Syria and was the main threat to the FSA. He added that he had run out of patience with the international community. Britain does not have to wait until August to start sending weapons to the Syrian rebels, William Hague has said. It had been thought that no EU countries could send weapons before 1 August, but the British foreign secretary told BBC Radio 4 that this was wrong: I must correct one thing because I know there's been discussion of some sort of August deadline. That is not the case. There will be a discussion in the EU by August 1 but from now on ... We have said, we have made our own commitments, that at this stage as we work for the Geneva conference we are not taking any decision to send any arms to anyone, but that is not related to a date of August 1; I don't want anyone to think that therefore there is any automatic decision after August 1 or that we are excluded from doing so beforehand. Yuval Steinitz, Israel\u2019s minister of intelligence, has condemned Russia\u2019s decision to ship the anti-aircraft missiles to the Syrian government, writes Phoebe Greenwood. Steinitz said it was wrong to describe the anti-aircraft S-300s as weapons of defence as because of their range of 300km; they could be used to target civilian or military aircraft over Tel Aviv. He said these weapons could also end up in the hands up of Hezbollah or Iran, thereby bypassing the arms embargo on Iran: Clearly supplying such advanced weapons to Assad in the middle of brutal civil war while he is slaughtering his own people, mostly his own civilians on a daily basis, is a kind of encouragement to this brutal regime that is totally wrong from a moral point of view. One cannot justify such behaviour. But he said he was also worried about weapons coming in from the EU to the rebels eventually being used to target Israel: We have decided not to encourage the United States or Europe to take any action there whatsoever because it\u2019s very complicated situation \u2026 There is always a worry [that these weapons will be used against Israel]; therefore if one supplies certain arms to certain groups in Syria, you have to consider carefully what sort of commitment you get from those groups about the use of those weapons. Dr Dominic Zaum, reader in international relations at the University of Reading, has been in touch to explain why Russia is able to sell these anti-aircraft missiles to Syria: As there are no UN sanctions against Syria, Russia can legally sell these missiles to the Syrian government. Sanctions on Syria have either been bilateral or EU sanctions, and therefore do not bind Russia. Militarily, they could increase the risk for countries using air strikes against targets in Syria - most likely Israel (especially now that Hezbollah is openly supporting the Assad regime militarily), and western states who might want to impose a no-fly zone, as Nato did in Libya in 2011. Given that greater involvement in the Syrian conflict is controversial in most western countries, even those most explicit in their call for support for the opposition such as the UK and France, the greater risk of casualties might well mute calls for a no-fly zone. A no-fly zone seems a remote possibility at the moment even without the delivery of these missiles, given the Russian objection to it in the UN security council. He adds that the more interesting issue here is the effect of the move on the planned peace conference next month. Just as the termination of the EU arms embargo on the Syrian opposition was intended by the UK and France to increase pressure on President Assad ahead of the conference, so could the delivery of these missiles have the effect of blunting the UK and France's efforts in this regard, as they are a very explicit symbol of continued Russian support for the Assad regime. Bashar al-Assad may be asking himself what has changed as he studies the EU\u2019s arms embargo announcement, writes Simon Tisdall: What has changed is that the two-year civil war is ever closer to fulfilling predictions that it will spill into neighbouring countries, principally Lebanon, Iraq, Jordan and Turkey, and spark a regional sectarian conflagration. Weekend missile attacks in southern Lebanon and Israel were further proof of that contention, as was Hezbollah's admission that its forces were fighting alongside Assad's troops. What has changed, as Oxfam among others has warned, is that by fuelling the conflict by sending yet more weapons to the combatants, Britain and France risk stoking a further rapid and potentially disastrous escalation; risk adding to the appalling toll of 80,000 people dead and millions displaced; and risk shooting down and killing off the already enfeebled diplomatic process they seek to sustain. Alex Winning has more on Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov's reaction to the EU arms embargo's being lifted. Ruabkov accused European leaders of \u201cfanning the flames of the conflict\", and told journalists that the EU\u2019s decision reflected \u201cdouble standards\u201d and dealt a serious blow to prospects of a peace conference. He also said that the S-300 anti-aircraft missiles cannot be used against rebel forces (presumably because they don't have aircraft). Ryabkov said that Russia would stick to its goal of securing a political solution to the Syria crisis and that a peace conference and ceasefire were essential first steps to end the bloodshed. Martin Chulov explains that the US has put its faith in Salam Idriss, the commander of the Free Syrian Army, as someone who can be trusted to be supplied with weapons via Saudi Arabia: A reluctant US administration has lately settled on Salam Idriss, the commander of the umbrella guerilla group, the Free Syria Army, as a leader in whom it is prepared to take a risk. Dealings between Idriss and the US military have stepped up in recent months, both in Jordan and Turkey, where small groups of Syrian rebels are being trained. An influx of Saudi supplied weapons that crossed the Jordanian border earlier this year were channelled through vetted Idriss loyalists. The supply included explosives that can take out tanks and cause extensive damage to structures as rebels advance. But it did not include the holy grail of heat seekers [shoulder-launched heat-seeking missiles]. The BBC has more from Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov on Moscow's decision to press ahead with the supply of S-300 anti-aircraft missiles to the Syrian government: We consider these supplies a stabilising factor and believe such steps will deter some hotheads from considering scenarios that would turn the conflict international with the involvement of outside forces. Russia's envoy to Nato, Aleksandr Grushko, said Moscow was acting \"fully within the framework of international law\": We are not doing anything that could change the situation in Syria. The arms that we supply are defensive weapons. Ryabkov said the contract for the missiles had been signed years ago. Russia is to go ahead with deliveries of anti-aircraft missiles to the Syrian government, the BBC reports. Sergei Ryabkov, the deputy foreign minister, has said the S-300 missiles were a \u201cstabilising factor\u201d that could dissuade \u201csome hotheads\u201d from joining the conflict. Earlier Israeli defence minister Moshe Yaalon said the S-300 missile system had not yet left Russia. \"I can say that the shipments are not on their way yet,\" Yaalon told reporters. \"I hope they will not leave, and if, God forbid, they reach Syria, we will know what to do,\" he said. Israel is worried the missiles could be used to attack its own cities. Russia's foreign minister said on 13 May that Moscow had no new plans to sell the S-300 to Syria but left open the possibility of delivering such systems under an existing contract. Russia and Iran will be keen to see Bashar al-Assad step down as soon as his seven-year term is up in 2014, according to Professor Fawaz Gerges, the director of the Middle East centre at the London School of Economics. He said that the way Russia and the United States viewed their proposed Syrian peace conference was \u201ca matter of nine/eight months of negotiations\u201d: This would coincide with the end of President Assad\u2019s presidential term, 2014. My take on it is the United States and Russia are viewing 2014 as the tipping point of a real political transition, whereby the end of Assad\u2019s term, elections would take place, and the transfer of authority to a transitional government might take place. With Assad, or without him? Without Assad. The Russian and Iranian leaderships have made it very clear that Assad will stay in place until 2014. I take it that both the Russian leadership and the Iranian leadership basically would like to see Assad go: a face-saving formula: he stayed, he fought, and then a new government would take his place. The question is: what kind of government, what kind of transitional government? What kind of reforms would be implemented within the security forces, in particular the army \u2026 and the balance of power between elements of the regime and the opposition itself, and this is really where the talks and the hard work and the details become very complicated. I asked Gerges what he thought of William Hague\u2019s theory that the threat of arming the rebels would be enough to force Assad to the negotiating table. My reading of the state of mind of President Assad and his conduct over the last two years tells me that I don\u2019t expect Assad to respond in the same way that Mr William Hague believes him to. I think had the decision been taken a year ago it would have made a probably critical difference. The Syrian conflict has now gone too long. It\u2019s an open-ended war by proxy. Assad is fighting a war to the bitter end. He views this war as existential. His regional supporters are deeply involved on his side. Russia is deeply invested in the survival of the Assad regime, if not Assad himself. I doubt it very much whether the European threat of sending arms to the rebels will make a qualitative difference, in particular because the United States remains opposed to arming the rebels. He said the \u201cgame-changer\u201d would be if the US decided to get involved, either directly or by arming the rebels \u2013 but he agreed this was unlikely. \u201cObama does not want another military adventure in the Middle East \u2026 He believes that Syria is the responsibility of Europe and the Arab world.\u201d What did Gerges think of the theory that any weapons meant for the \u201cgood guys\u201d among the rebels might make their way to Islamist insurgents such as the al-Nusra Front. One of the lessons we have learnt over the last 50 years when it comes to civil wars and regional conflicts, is once you send arms to a particular country, to a particular faction, the supplier will have no control over where the weapons go and where they travel \u2026 I doubt it very much that Britain and France would have control over where the arms go once they enter Syria. But he felt Britain had no intention of actually sending arms at this point, and the decision to lift the embargo was a \u201cpolitical tool, a threat\u201d. And he added: Mr William Hague has made it clear more than once that Britain knows the risks that these weapons could and would fall into the wrong hands. But Britain is willing to take risks given the escalation of this conflict, and given the huge human toll that the use of massive force by Bashar al-Assad has exacted on the Syrian population. Here is William Hague\u2019s statement on the EU decision last night. The British foreign secretary said: \u201cIt has been difficult for many nations, of course. That is why we have had such long discussions today \u2026 We have agreed as member states to make clear commitments about the restrictions on any arms we would supply, and on common rules, on the basis of common rules, and I think the whole of the European Union is very strongly committed to a political settlement in Syria. So yes, of course, on such a difficult foreign policy issue, there are disagreements, and yes we have had some disagreements today, but we have resolved those disagreements, I think on the right basis for the future. Oxfam\u2019s Anna Macdonald said the charity was disappointed in the EU\u2019s decision, adding: \u201cThis decision does not give the green light to any member states who want to supply arms to groups in Syria. As clearly laid out in the EU Common Position on Arms Transfers, any transfers must be subject to full risk assessment procedures against the risks of arms being used for violations of human rights and humanitarian law.\u201d Robert Fox, the London Evening Standard\u2019s defence editor, was just interviewed about the lifting of the arms embargo on BBC News. We\u2019re encouraging intervention, but not necessarily with our boots on the ground \u2013 which is the worst of all possible worlds, because \u2026 it means that the criminal networks that can distribute arms now feel that they\u2019ve got a go-ahead, as long as somebody else does. In the past when this has happened \u2013 Yugoslavia, Afghanistan \u2026 Libya in particular \u2013 the wrong arms go to the wrong guys. And if we\u2019re talking about highly portable, highly sophisticated anti-aircraft missiles it could end up very quickly among the al-Qaida affiliates like the al-Nusra Front, which is very prominent in the fighting in Syria. And nothing that seems to be said from the EU, by Mr Hague, by Paris, or by Whitehall, seems to have a clue how to stop all of that. Eyewitness testimony and graphic video footage seems to support claims that one of the worst atrocities of the Syrian civil war was carried out in three neighbouring districts in Bayda and Baniyas earlier this month, the BBC reports. The BBC says opposition activists have documented the deaths of more than 200 people, including women and children; the Syrian government says it killed \u201cterrorist fighters\u201d. The BBC reports: On 2 May, government troops and militias marched into al-Bayda, in Tartous province on Syria's Mediterranean coast. The following day they attacked neighbouring Baniyas. Together government forces have described these operations as a \"strike against armed terrorists\". State media reported that 40 opposition fighters were killed. But Syrian human rights activists and eyewitnesses claim that more than 200 civilians died and hundreds are missing in what they allege was a brutal sectarian attack against innocent civilians \u2026 Numerous pictures and videos that appear to show the aftermath of Baniyas are horrific; men, women and children, some terribly disfigured, piled together, and what appear to be entire families killed. The women we interviewed described similar scenes. \"There were slaughtered corpses and charred bodies everywhere\", says Om Abed [not her real name]. \"Houses were on fire. The people inside them were burning. An entire family lay down dead, slaughtered in one house. There was so much blood.\" This map shows where Bayda and Baniyas are (yellow pins). Here is some response from British MPs to William Hague\u2019s successful attempt to get the EU arms embargo against Syrian rebels dropped. From Douglas Alexander, the shadow foreign secretary: From Labour MP Emily Thornberry: From Labour MP Richard Burden: From Conservative MP Brooks Newmark: A Syrian TV correspondent was killed covering the fighting near Qusair yesterday. Yara Abbas, who worked for the state-owned Al-Ikhbariyah TV, was attacked by rebels who ambushed the car carrying her and her crew, the Syrian information ministry said. A cameraman and his assistant were wounded, according to the report. AFP reported that she was 26. The Lebanese army has said it is investigating the attack on a checkpoint in which three soldiers were killed and its troops are searching for the gunmen. Lebanon is divided over the Syrian civil war. The Shia militant group Hezbollah is fighting alongside Assad's troops, while many Sunnis back the opposition. In Tripoli, a city in the north of Lebanon, factions backing the two sides have been fighting over the last few days. Russia has said that the European Union's lifting of the arms embargo on Syrian rebels will undermine the chance the peace conference that Russia and the United States are trying to organise being successful. \"This does direct damage to the propects for convening the international conference,\" Sergei Ryabkov, the deputy foreign minister, said. Good morning and welcome to the Middle East live blog. We'll have live coverage of developments from the region throughout the day. Syria \u2022 The EU arms embargo on Syria will not be renewed, meaning Britain and France can supply arms to the Syrian opposition from 1 August. London and Paris were the only capitals of 27 EU countries that backed letting the embargo lapse this Friday, UK foreign secretary William Hague arguing that the mere threat of arms would force Bashar al-Assad to the negotiations. But the other EU countries \u2013 despite worries the arms would fall into the hands of Islamist rebels such as Jabhat al-Nusra \u2013 assented, to preserve a semblance of unified policy, since the refusal of Britain and France to go along with the arms embargo could have caused the collapse of all EU sanctions against Syria. The August start date was decided upon to give the EU time to gauge what might happen at the peace talks in Geneva mooted for next month, although there is no certainty they will take place or who will attend. All the other parts of the Syrian embargo were retained apart from the arms embargo on the rebels. \u2022 Austria was a strong opponent of letting the embargo lapse, and foreign minister Michael Spindelegger said that Vienna would now have to reconsider its deployment on a long-running UN peacekeeping mission in the Golan Heights between Syria and Israel. Vienna has said in the past it might have to pull its 380 soldiers out if the arms embargo was eased. \u2022 Medics working in six rebel-held districts near Damascus have treated several hundred fighters for symptoms of chemical exposure since March, a detailed investigation has found, adding fresh impetus to claims the Syrian regime has resorted to the banned weapons. France is testing samples of suspected chemical weapon elements used against Syrian rebel fighters and smuggled out by reporters from Le Monde and will divulge the results in the next few days, a senior French official said. \u2022 The battle for Qusair near the border with Lebanon continued to rage on Monday, with Hezbollah forces advancing slowly from the south, but continuing to take heavy casualties. Officials close to the Islamic Dawa party in Lebanon suggested to Lebanese media that between 79-110 Hezbollah militants had been killed in Qusair in the past eight days. \u2022 Some 96 people were killed across Syria yesterday, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights, an activist monitoring group. The group said 30 of those were killed in Homs, and 28 in Damascus and its surrounding areas. The Local Co-ordination Committees, another activist group, said 89 people had been killed, including 27 in Damascus and 27 in Homs. These accounts cannot be verified because media access to Syria is limited. \u2022 A British doctor who left his home, family and job in the UK to help civilians wounded by the conflict in Syria has died after the makeshift hospital he was working in was shelled. Dr Isa Abdur Rahman, 26, was working as a volunteer in the north-western city of Idlib with the British charity Hand in Hand for Syria (HIHS) when the facility was attacked. \u2022 Hawkish US senator John McCain met rebel leaders inside Syria to discuss their calls for heavy weapons and a no-fly zone to help them topple Assad and bring the bitter civil war to a conclusion. The Arizona senator has been leading efforts in Congress in recent weeks to force Barack Obama to intervene in Syria following reports of alleged chemical weapons use by forces loyal to Assad. Lebanon \u2022 Gunmen opened fire on a military checkpoint in Lebanon's eastern Bekaa Valley this morning, killing three soldiers before fleeing to the nearby Syrian border, a Lebanese military source told Reuters. The source said two of the soldiers died in the attack, near the town of Arsal, and a third died later in hospital. The border areas around Arsal are used by Syrian rebels to smuggle weapons and fighters from Lebanon across into Syria, and the region has seen previous clashes between the Lebanese military and gunmen. The news comes two days after a rocket attack hit Beirut's southern suburbs near the heartland of Hezbollah, raising fears Lebanon could be drawn more deeply into the Syrian conflict next door. Iraq \u2022 A wave of bombs exploded in markets in mainly Shia neighbourhoods across Baghdad on Monday, killing at least 66 people and injuring nearly 200, increasing fears that Iraq risks sliding back into broad sectarian conflict. Israel and the Palestinian territories \u2022 European football's governing body, Uefa, has been accused of showing \"total insensitivity\" to the \"blatant and entrenched discrimination\" of Israel against Palestinian sportspeople."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
