If Sariska's preparation for the Classic goes as smoothly as her run in the Musidora Stakes here yesterday, though, Bell will not need the cigs quite as much as he thinks. This was about as convincing as a Classic trial ever gets. Sariska did not win by 10 lengths, but then a wide margin in a trial always makes you wonder just what the winner has beaten. Instead, she pulled nearly four lengths clear of what looked to be a field packed with potential, and did so in the style of a filly with more improvement to come. Star Ruby, the winner of her only previous race, was second, with Enticement, the 7-4 favourite for Sir Michael Stoute and Ryan Moore, a fairly distant and disappointing third. Enticement had attracted money all day, as runners in the Queen's colours tend to do, but while she looked outstanding before, and possibly did not act on the fast ground, she simply could not quicken from over two furlongs out and was one of the first beaten. Sariska, by contrast, travelled smoothly for Jamie Spencer and then found plenty when required to get past Star Ruby. Bell, who took the Dante with Motivator at this meeting four years ago on the way to winning the Derby, was noticeably confident afterwards that a complete set of Epsom Classics is now within reach. \"This is the sort of pressure that you want when you're a trainer,\" Bell said. \"You'd much rather be going to a race like the Oaks with the favourite than with a 100-1 shot. It was an easy call to miss the Guineas with her. We thought it would all happen too quickly for her over a mile, the dam's side of her pedigree is stamina, stamina, stamina, so we were pretty emphatic that the further she went, the better she'd be. \"She's always been the apple of my eye. She may have lost a few friends in the Fred Darling [when she was beaten at Newbury], but this was more like Newmarket last autumn when she burst on the scene as a good filly and she's one to look forward to. She'll take a bit of beating [at Epsom].\" Sariska was briefly available at 5-1 for the Oaks after yesterday's trial, but was no better than 4-1 within an hour, with Rainbow View, the beaten favourite in the 1,000 Guineas, and Midday, the Lingfield Oaks Trial winner, next in at a top price of 6-1. Star Ruby, who would need to be supplemented, has been taken out of most lists, while Enticement is out to 20-1, having been backed at less than half those odds yesterday morning. This was the first day of racing on York's newly relaid turf, though whether long-standing drainage problems have finally been resolved will become clear only when it receives heavy rain, which may be as early as today. The good-to-firm going yesterday was expected to work against Utmost Respect, whose previous winning form was all on good ground or softer, but Richard Fahey's sprinter looked outstanding in the paddock and was an impressive winner of the Duke Of York Stakes at 16-1. \"I was very worried about the ground but I took a chance and got away with it,\" Fahey said. \"He'll be in all the Group One races, but to be a Group One horse he needs softer ground, even though he put up a good performance today. I was critical of the ground at Royal Ascot last year, but I went down to walk it the other day and it was beautiful so if it turns up like that, I might think about the Golden Jubilee.\" William Buick recorded a handicap double on Brief Encounter and Spring Jim, while Godolphin won the opening race on the card for the third successive year with Moonquake. Having also won the Group Two Italian Derby with Mastery last weekend, Saeed bin Suroor will be hoping for a further resurgence for the royal blue silks when Kite Wood runs in the Dante Stakes this afternoon. \"Kite Wood is a horse we've always liked,\" Suroor said afterwards. \"He's improved both mentally and physically over the winter. Mastery is not entered at Epsom but we could supplement him.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
