The Sheffield United striker caused a storm last week among Scotland fans by making apparently disparaging comments about the international setup that were inadvertently picked up on a club video. \u201cI\u2019m sure the supporters will get right behind the team,\u201d said Clarke, who is likely to start McBurnie against Russia at Hampden on Friday night. \u201cThe best thing he can do is go out, play really well and show everybody how committed he is. If he wants, he could score a goal. That would be nice as well.\u201d McBurnie had offered an explanation to his Scotland teammates in full public view before training on Monday. \u201cWe could have done it inside but it was better to do it outside,\u201d the manager said. \u201cClarified and clear. We have moved on and we urge everyone else to move on from it. Finished. \u201cIf he didn\u2019t want to be here, he wouldn\u2019t be here. That\u2019s the bottom line. He had never worked with me before. He has no reason to say: \u2018I don\u2019t want to go,\u2019 because he didn\u2019t know what it was like. After the game you can quiz him and he will tell you he enjoyed it.\u201d Russia are three points ahead of Scotland in a Euro 2020 qualifying group in which Belgium, who visit Hampden on Monday, appear destined to win. Clarke senses his team are overdue a shock result. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since Scotland had a win where everyone went: \u2018Ooof, where did that come from?\u2019\u201d Clarke said. \u201cAs a nation we like to get excited. It\u2019s one of those results that we need. It\u2019s a chance at home against Russia to set down a marker and say we are still in this group and fighting to get out of it.\u201d Scotland (4-3-2-1, possible) Marshall; O\u2019Donnell, Cooper, Mulgrew, Robertson; McTominay, McGinn, McGregor; Forrest, Fraser; McBurnie. Russia (4-5-1, possible) Guilherme; Kudryashov, Dzhikiya, Semenov, Fernandes; Zobnin, Golivin, Yerokhin, Cheryshev, Ionov; Dzyuba."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
