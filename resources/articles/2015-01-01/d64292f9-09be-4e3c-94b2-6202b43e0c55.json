But the whole thing was different.\u201d The culture shock included being confronted by female journalists in the dressing room after matches. \u201cOne of the strangest things was the reporters in the locker room,\u201d says the 32-year-old. \u201cThe thing is \u2013 it\u2019s mixed. I used to forget and just come out of the shower. I would be like: \u2018Oooof.\u2019 I was literally sat there and surrounded by journalists and I\u2019d just got out of the shower. I\u2019d never experienced anything like that before. \u201cAnd in that first game against Seattle \u2026 I came out on to the pitch on a red carpet with fireworks going off. I was like: \u2018Wow.\u2019 Then someone got tackled and everyone in the crowd jumped up and waved yellow cards. Everything was just different.\u201d Since signing for Sunderland, Defoe has become reacquainted with English football traditions. \u201cI had an initiation. I had to stand on a chair and sing a song,\u201d he says. \u201cI did Usher \u2013 My Way. I sing all the time but I was nervous. We used to do the same initiation at Tottenham and I was always the one at the front abusing the new players so it was quite strange.\u201d The reassuring familiarity of scoring goals again cannot come soon enough for a forward Poyet claims has already \u201ctransformed\u201d Sunderland. Defoe, defying the north-east chill in a short-sleeved training top, was surprised to hear that comment. \u201cI didn\u2019t know Gus had said that. It\u2019s been a good feeling walking in here and getting the love from everyone. The staff, the fans, everyone. When you get that sort of love it makes you want to work even harder. I\u2019ve watched tapes of that season when Kevin Phillips got 30 Premier League goals here. Incredible. As a forward you look at that and think: \u2018I\u2019d love to do something similar here.\u2019\u201d Should he do so Defoe will surely fulfil his ambition of adding to his 55 England caps. \u201cI would like to represent my country again,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the best thing in the world, playing for your country, pulling that shirt on. If I\u2019m scoring goals, I\u2019d like to think I\u2019ll get the opportunity to do that again.\u201d Being left out of Roy Hodgson\u2019s World Cup squad last year was a defining moment, convincing Defoe he needed to leave Toronto. \u201cI was devastated,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d been involved in every squad. If I\u2019m honest, I thought I was going. When I got the phone call it was hard. \u201cAt the back of my mind I thought the main reason was because I\u2019d left the Premier League. \u201cI think the manager looked at that. Roy Hodgson spoke to me. He just said: \u2018It\u2019s a difficult one, I\u2019m leaving you, Ashley Cole and Michael Carrick out.\u2019 He said it was because he wanted to go with a lot of the younger players who had done well. But at the end of the day, Roy knows what he gets from me. He can look at my England record. \u201cI still think I\u2019ve got a lot to offer England. I still feel sharp. I still feel like I\u2019ve got a lot of goals left in me. I was disappointed and upset to miss out on the World Cup but at the same time I still want to play for my country. I still want to score goals for England.\u201d He believes he has the perfect mentor in Poyet. \u201cI knew Gus from playing with him at Tottenham and being coached by him when he was back there with Juande Ramos. I always had a good relationship with Gus. He\u2019s someone who I\u2019ve always liked as a person, he\u2019s a good man and he\u2019s a good coach. When I had the conversation with Gus and he explained how he wanted Sunderland to play, I pretty much made my mind up straightaway. He said: \u2018If you come up here and score goals you\u2019ll love it, trust me.\u2019\u201d Defoe, who did not score on his debut on Saturday at Tottenham, is anything but cowed by being cast as the saviour. \u201cI\u2019ve been brought in to score goals but it\u2019s a good pressure,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to enjoy it, you\u2019ve got to embrace it. I love playing football, I love scoring goals and I always believe that if I get the chances, I\u2019ll score.\u201d He revealed he might have joined Sunderland earlier. \u201cYears ago, something nearly happened. I thought if I had to leave Tottenham I\u2019d want to go somewhere like Sunderland where the stadium is unbelievable and they have great fans. I\u2019ve only ever heard good things about this place. I\u2019ve always known over the years that it\u2019s a special club.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
