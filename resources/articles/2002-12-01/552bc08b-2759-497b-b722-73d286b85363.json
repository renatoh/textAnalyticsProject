But on an evening of huge Arsenal effort but few clear opportunities, the striker was left to reflect that top-level European competition does not allow for the slightest wasted chance. Given his one genuine sight of goal in the first half, Henry hit the goalkeeper rather than the target. To hold him responsible for Arsenal's draw would be harsh - Freddie Ljungberg wasted a good opening and Sylvain Wiltord a glaring one - but on such moments against teams like Valencia is destiny decided. Arsenal's game at Manchester United on Saturday had been billed as a battle between Henry and Ruud van Nistelrooy. Much had been expected to depend here on the form of Henry and Pablo Aimar, the brilliant Argentinian just back from injury for Valencia. Arsenal fans had expected him to produce a big performance to follow his memorable hat-trick at Roma in the previous Champions League game. Moreover, he had been given an added incentive to impress by the morning papers. Vicente, the Valencia midfielder, had been quoted as making critical comments about the Frenchman, including the assessment that he often \"lacks character at key moments\". If the remarks were accurately reported, it had looked ideal motivation for Henry. \"I've seen him play lots of times and he tries to be so elegant that he might as well go on to the pitch wearing his dinner jacket,\" Vicente said. \"He's too laid back. If you keep him tightly marked he hardly makes a contribution.\" Henry certainly struggled to make an impact in the first half. The Valencia defence, and in particular their two centre-backs Fabian Ayala and Mauricio Pellegrino, are hard characters and Arsenal were finding it difficult to get a hold on the game. When Henry finally got the chance to sprint towards goal just after the half-hour, his nerve failed him. Patrick Vieira did not have one of his best nights in possession before going off injured but his pass sent his compatriot through. The Valencia goalkeeper Andres Palop saved as Henry tried to bend his shot into the corner. A cross might have put in Freddie Ljungberg. A couple of Henry free-kicks also came to nought and, at the other end, Aimar was not a sparkling first-half figure either. Having only returned from a muscle injury as a substitute at the weekend, it was asking a lot for him to get straight into his stride. Yet his instinct for danger was plain to see. Twice he was not far from getting decisive touches to crosses from Valencia's dangerous right-sided midfielder Miguel Angel Angulo. On a third occasion he was hovering behind Pascal Cygan as the ball flew into the area, ready to pounce on any mistake. After the break Henry began to come into the game more now as Arsenal found real verve at the start of the second half. But Aimar, too, was showing more of the quick feet that mark him out, eluding challenges and doing his bit defensively. As a tight match neared its conclusion, both players were still dreaming of that telling touch."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
