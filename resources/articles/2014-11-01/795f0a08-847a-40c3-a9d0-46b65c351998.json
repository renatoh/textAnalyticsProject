Budgets for temporary staff this financial year have already been blown apart, it can be revealed, with spending in some parts of the NHS running at twice the planned figure. Reliance on agencies \u2013 at a cost of up to \u00a31,800 per day per nurse \u2013 comes as the number of nurse training places in England has been cut. In the last year of the Labour government, 20,829 nurse training positions were filled in England. That fell to 17,741 in 2011-12 and to 17,219 in 2012-13, rising to 18,009 in 2013-14. According to the latest figures, there were 7,000 fewer qualified nurses in August 2013 compared with May 2010, excluding health visitors, school nurses and midwives. Ministers were accused on Saturday of \u201ctruly incompetent planning\u201d by the Royal College of Nurses. Many of the agency nurses filling the gaps are from abroad, which means their home countries are robbed of medical expertise. Last year 6,228 foreign nurses registered with the Nursing and Midwifery Council, 22% of the total number of new nurses qualified to work. This compares with 4,305 the previous year. Dr Peter Carter, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: \u201cThese spending figures beggar belief and are the result of truly incompetent workforce planning. Nursing staff are sometimes seen as an easy target for cost savings, only for the NHS to find itself dangerously short- staffed and having to plug the gap. This means individual hospitals and the NHS as a whole are spending too much on agency staff and recruitment from overseas.\u201d New figures released by the government following a parliamentary question show that NHS Foundation Trusts spent \u00a34.3bn between 2010-11 and 2013-14 on agency and temporary staff. Other NHS Trusts spent \u00a31.2bn in 2013/2014, but figures were not available for these trusts over the previous years, meaning the total bill for the last four years could be closer to \u00a310bn.The figures show that, despite repeated pledges to cut spending on this, the cost to NHS foundation trusts has gone up by around 20% for each of the four financial years of the coalition government. In the last year of the Labour government, NHS foundation trusts spent \u00a3734m. In 2013-14 that had doubled to \u00a31.3bn. Trusts are now facing what Monitor, the NHS regulator, calls \u201cunprecedented financial pressure\u201d due to their reliance on expensive agency staff. The most recent quarterly report from the regulator warned that the current spending on agencies was unsustainable. It said: \u201cFoundation trusts continue to experience difficulties in recruiting and retaining permanent staff. Given the growth in demand \u2026 a planned year-on-year reduction in agency staff usage has not materialised. Instead, spend on contract and agency staff is double the planned figure. In the medium to long term, this level of spend on temporary staff cannot be sustained.\u201d The shadow health secretary, Andy Burnham, said that under Labour\u2019s plans, an additional 20,000 nurses would be recruited by 2020: \u201cThe soaring bill for agency staff, now bleeding the NHS dry, is a direct consequence of David Cameron\u2019s disastrous NHS reorganisation. \u201cThe dismantling of NHS workforce planning and training structures has created a shortage of staff and left the NHS with a whopping bill for agency staff. This is draining NHS finances and damaging standards of patient care. \u201cIn parts of the NHS, spending on agency staff has doubled under David Cameron. Cameron\u2019s mismanagement of the NHS has trapped hospitals in a downward spiral. The NHS now urgently needs a change of course and a change of government. The Tories have shown once again that they just can\u2019t be trusted with the NHS.\u201d A Department of Health spokesperson said that responding to the Francis inquiry into poor care at Mid Staffs NHS Trust, which called for increasing staffing on wards, had forced the NHS to rely on agencies and temporary workers. He said: \u201cIn the wake of Mid Staffs, there has been some increased spend on agency staff to correct historic understaffing, but we now have 13,500 more clinicians since May 2010 and are reducing reliance on expensive agency workers \u2013 because delivering safe care and balancing the books go hand in hand.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
