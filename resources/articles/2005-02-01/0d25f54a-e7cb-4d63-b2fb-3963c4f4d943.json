It was a warm sunny day in mid-December, with the clear, crystal air typical of the winter months on Spain's eastern coast. Setting off from Valencia, I left plenty of time for the journey. About half an hour in, we left the plain and headed up into the mountains that divide these two Mediterranean cities. It began to snow, heavily, and the train came to a stop. Time passed, the frozen air slowly blanking out the world around us, bare almond trees like bony fingers vanishing in a wintry haze. Having lived in Spain for more than 10 years by then I had allowed for some hold-ups, but the hour hand on my neighbour's watch moved relentlessly on. If we didn't start again shortly I would miss my plane - never an enjoyable experience but this time I was travelling to a funeral. My grandfather had always complained about my time-keeping when he was alive: I was damned if I was going to be late for him now. This being a Spanish train, everyone in the carriage was already talking to each other, passing round pieces of sausage. The inspector didn't have much news - the snow made it simply too risky to carry on. We'd wait a bit more. In general the Spanish can be a nervous people, charging around trying to get things done, but when a certain point is reached a kind of fatalism takes over and they place themselves passively in the hands of destiny; everyone settled down comfortably for a long wait and a nice chat. I, on the other hand, couldn't sit still. At the top of the train I could see a group of passengers huddled round the open door of the driver's cabin. Five or six voices were jabbering at once offering advice and sympathy. I ambled up and joined the group. 'No chance of us moving?' I asked. The driver explained about the snow and everyone concurred knowingly. In desperation I mentioned I had a plane to catch, and the reason for my journey. As soon as I'd spoken a change came over everyone. For a second the driver looked as though he was about to shake his head, but the other passengers leaned in towards him expectantly. He paused, drew on his cigarette, then gave a quick look to the inspector, who nodded. Within seconds we were rocketing through the snow once more. I smiled: only in Spain could something like this happen - caution and safety tossed aside because someone needed help, as though some ancient code of chivalry had kicked in which overrode all other concerns. What could be more important than getting somebody to a family funeral? We sped down the mountainside and the snow began to thin out, then vanish entirely. Before long we were down on the coast once more and the sun was shining. The train screeched into Alicante station and as I sprinted down the platform to find a taxi the train driver, inspector and a dozen other passengers cheered me on, waving and shouting as though at a race track. 'Venga!' You can do it! The taxi careered through the traffic. I caught the plane, with seconds to spare. What happened to me that day on the train encapsulates so much of what I love about Spain. Just as when the bank clerk forged my signature on some papers to save me the hassle of signing them myself, it underlines the existence of a true humanity among the Spanish which can rise up and help you, guide you or protect you at unexpected moments, much as in a fairy tale. Yet it tends to do so in a way that also cocks a snook at the law and the authorities. There is a life-affirming eccentricity here which tells me that craziness and chaos are an essential part of life; it is healthy and real. Britain, in contrast, seems a slightly odd place obsessed with rules. More and more this feels like home. The train story also holds another truth about Spain for me in the suddenness of its changes - the snow and the sun, motionlessness turning into speed, the helplessness and the happy ending. Few things in Spain are ever grey. They are black and white, usually both at the same time. It is a place of extremes. The moment you make any sweeping statement about the country or the people you find exactly the opposite is also true. The Spanish are deeply humane, as I've said, yet they can be exceptionally cruel - hence bullfighting and the bloodshed of the Spanish Civil War. They are elemental and raw, even, yet capable of such sublime buildings as the Alhambra or the cathedral at Santiago. The landscape can be of a suicide-inducing bleakness, yet also of ineffable beauty. Often these extremes are right next to each other. On occasions I have been driving through an exceptionally desolate area only to turn a corner and find myself in a secret part of paradise. Anyone who's been to the monasteries of Guadalupe in Extremadura or Piedra in Aragon will know what I mean. Not only is Spain physically immense, its geographical and cultural riches are so varied I often get the sense you would never need travel to any other country. This is home to the world's best restaurant - El Bulli, near Girona - and also the scene of Bu\u00f1uel's film Land Without Bread, a documentary about the shocking poverty in Las Hurdes. Bu\u00f1uel was filming there in the 1930s; I've been there recently and things haven't changed as much as they might. But strangely Spain doesn't always get the best press abroad. Partly it stems from an inferiority complex with regard to the rest of Europe dating from the loss of its last colonies in 1898. The Disaster, as it was known, shook everyone up from the slumber of empire and made the Spanish realise they were years behind everyone else. As a result they do not believe enough in themselves. France casts a long shadow from behind the Pyrenees, while every Spaniard has engraved in his heart Dumas's phrase that the mountain chain actually marks the starting point of Africa. But if it couldn't compete culturally with its northern neighbours, at least, so the thinking went, Spain had sol y playa - sun, sea and sand. And so Franco and his ministers pushed this image to the world, and the visitors came with their pounds and marks. With the arrival of the pink tourists and their tubes of suncream, though, there also developed a new idea outside the country: the concept of the Real Spain. I remember as a child living in Britain and hearing people speak about 'the Real Spain' as something wonderful and magical but hidden to the hordes sweating in their millions by the seaside. It was one of the reasons why I came here looking for flamenco and 'Spanish passion' in the first place. For me, as for many others then, this was the Spain of Almod\u00f3var films, of bright colours and warm friendly people - everything Britain wasn't. It was start ing to be cool to talk about moving to Barcelona, the Expo was on in Seville. Spain was arriving. I knew as soon as I landed, though, that I wanted to discover the country for myself. Real Spain existed, I was certain, but I wanted to look for it in my own way. And so I started with the world of flamenco and the Gypsies. Now, more than a decade on, I'm still here, living with a Spanish woman, and still looking. I have travelled round the country several times over, explored its music and culture, entered the world of North African immigrants and searched for the legacy of the Moors. I've met veterans from the Civil War, learned to cook paella and been to a concert by a 'gay anarchist rock band'. Yet still there is so much more to see, feel and experience. There is never just one 'Real Spain'. It is a vast labyrinth of a place, somewhere you feel you are always on the brink of discovering and understanding yet which somehow always remains just beyond your reach. Part of the problem may be in how we look. For a while it has been fashionable to travel up from the coasts a few miles and buy an old house - usually in the Andalucian sierra - and perhaps do it up, as though just by heading inland a bit you could find the real thing. You can, to an extent, but how long will it take before the word sierra has the almost derogatory ring of costa? 'Moving to Barcelona' has already become a clich\u00e9. The belt of tourism circling this awe-inspiring country has merely widened a bit, while the Real Spain, you sense, remains untouched. How many who come here have really scratched the surface? It's not that Real Spain doesn't exist on the costas or in the sierra. It does, but probably not at the big nightclub on the beach front. Rather it's at the working men's bar round the corner, where builders knock back brandies and coffee before the morning shift, or at the market at the edge of town where the man on the cheese stall has a cigar stub fixed permanently in the corner of his mouth. I've found Real Spain chatting to a singing shepherd in the dry plains of La Mancha, watching square-shaped Basque oarsmen rowing out to sea from Hondarribia in long-boat competitions, walking round the royal gardens at La Granja in the snow, or stumbling ignorantly into the middle of a village square near Teruel just as a bull-running fiesta began. I've found it in the wines of the Duero region and in the fresh graffiti on the old city walls in M\u00e9rida. But more often than not these magical moments happen when you're least expecting them, in everyday life: buying the newspaper, crossing the street or just catching a train. Spain is complex and beautiful. Yet as with anything, from rock climbing to opera, it requires effort and work to be truly enjoyed. 'Diet Spain' is available aplenty. It is, unfortunately, what has been exported for so long, and the only thing many visitors have found here. Spain needs to learn that it, like France, has much, perhaps more, to be proud of. Spaniards will often complain foreigners are only ever interested in flamenco, bullfighting and castanets, typical Espanish, as they refer to it. We are excited - or horrified - by these things because they are so different from anything in Western culture. Yet there is much else to find fascinating in this land. It may be that the Spanish themselves need the help of foreigners travelling with open eyes to realise how wonderful the country in which they live really is. An insider's guide to real Spanish treats ... Monasterio de Piedra On the border between Aragon and Castille, this Cistercian monastery has been converted into a hotel. The vast gardens include waterfalls and lakes. Best to go off-season or on a weekday to avoid crowds of Aragonese in search of greenery. Frias Unspoilt hilltop village on the banks of the Ebro in the northern Burgos province. This area was the birthplace of the old county of Castille. A fortified medieval bridge still spans the river while the castle, whose origins go back to the 10th century, perches on a steep rock in the centre of the village. The landscape is breathtaking. Museo de Bellas Artes, Valencia This art gallery is free, virtually empty and has one of the finest collections outside the Prado. Check out the paintings by Goya and Vel\u00e1zquez, while the courtyard has the original stone inscription proclaiming Phillip III's expulsion of the Moors in 1609. Perfect for a quiet afternoon away from the crowds. Siurana de Prades The last outpost of the Moors in Catalunya, this clifftop village has spectacular views over the wine-growing areas of Tarragona. The sheer rock face is known as El Salto de la Reina Mora, in honour of the last Moorish queen of the area, who threw herself off the mountain rather than surrender to the Christians. Almonester La Real The tiny castle at this picturesque little village in Huelva province is a perfect symbol of Spain itself, being a mixture of everything from Visigothic to Moorish to Reconquest and Napoleonic. You may come across painters dotted around the streets taking advantage of the sparkling light. Up the road is Jabugo, left, home to the finest pata negra hams in the country. Las Hurdes Bu\u00f1uel made this area of Extremadura famous with his film Land Without Bread. There is less poverty now, but this is still very much 'Darkest Spain'. Try to find the village of El Gasco - it's not on the map - and you'll find remnants of what Bu\u00f1uel was filming, as well as a waterfall half an hour's walk further up the valley which is ideal for cooling down on a summer's afternoon. Ask the locals to explain the region's legends and folklore; Christianity only took root here 100 years ago. Yuste Of all his empire, Charles V decided Yuste in Extremadura was the most beautiful spot and where he wanted to live out his retirement. You can visit the apartments the emperor had built on to the monastery where monks prayed for his soul, and stay at the parador at nearby Jarandilla - a converted castle of the Counts of Oropesa. Rubielos de Mora Perhaps the prettiest village in Teruel Province, this is a tiny collection of well-preserved medieval and Renaissance palaces and buildings. You reach the centre through elegant ancient stone gates. During the summer months they have night bull-running through the narrow streets, when flaming torches are attached to the animals' horns - a strangely compelling spectacle. Ceuta Along with its cousin Melilla further down the Moroccan coast, Ceuta, left, is an outcrop of Europe on the African mainland. Muslims, Christians and Jews live together in relative harmony in a microcosm of the pluralist society that existed in Spain before the Inquisition. The crossing into Morocco is one of the craziest borders in the world. \u00b7 Jason Webster is the author of Duende.
