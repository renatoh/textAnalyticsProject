At best she expected a couple of hundred people to show up. Maldon isn\u2019t exactly Galway or Whitstable after all, and there was no tradition of celebrating salty-sweet molluscs. But once social media caught wind of it, foodies snapped up the tickets. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t quite Glastonbury but it got to the point where 6,000 tickets had been bought in two weeks,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cThen the council told me I had to declare it sold out.\u201d It was so popular, in fact, that this year\u2019s event has been moved to a bigger site, capable of hosting more than 30,000 oyster-lovers \u2013 and Taylor says she expects to fill it. \u201cIt\u2019s generated such a buzz, the whole town\u2019s got behind it \u2013 the shops, the restaurants, the fishermen. When I walk around now, people say, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re the oyster lady\u2019 \u2013 like I\u2019ve been doing it for 40 years!\u201d Taylor\u2019s is a good example of a fast-growing breed of boutique festivals that are popping up all over Britain, with numbers doubling in the past year to more than 18,000. The phenomenon has its roots in America, says Paul McCrudden, whose San Francisco-based company, Eventbrite, allows users to post details of their upcoming events and manage the flow of budding participants for everything from knitting festivals to toe-wrestling. It\u2019s active here in the UK too, where food-themed festivals alone have risen 600% in the past four years, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s bringing the niche and the underground mainstream,\u201d McCrudden says. \u201cAnyone can create one and anyone can attend.\u201d That\u2019s how Shonette Bason saw it too. Fed up with what she calls \u201cmoaning lemon suckers\u201d, Bason decided to create her own festival based on the science of happiness. The idea was to bring as many positive people together as possible, even though Bason, a self-styled happiness guru, was aware that her chirpy disposition meant \u201cI just irritate people all the time!\u201d To her surprise, though, about 1,000 like-minded souls flocked to a warehouse in Old Trafford in Manchester last summer. And they were happy enough to pay \u00a330 a pop to hear Bason\u2019s motivational tips on ditching the grimace and staying tip-top. \u201cPeople are always telling us why we should be miserable but there is nobody telling us how we can be happy,\u201d says Bason, whose festival travels to Birmingham this year in an attempt to spread positive vibes across the Midlands. Happiness is actually really easy, she says. \u201cYou just go back to your childhood, you know, those days when you rolled down grass hills and didn\u2019t check for dog poo.\u201d For Ken Davis, happiness is a cup of tea \u2013 so last year he set about creating the Great British Tea Festival, staged in an old railway house in Derby. Like the Essex oysters, Davis had limited expectations; he even thought it might just be himself and a small gaggle of workmates. But in the end, 800 people paid \u00a33.95 a ticket to sip teas from all over the world and listen to Davis enthuse about one of his favourite pastimes. \u201cI simply couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d he says. A second festival is set for October, with more than 1,000 tea-lovers expected to turn up for a brew. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of an old-fashioned thing \u2013 perhaps that\u2019s why people like it,\u201d says Davis. Eleanor Taylor says she believes micro-festivals such as these are taking off because they focus on simple values, with the idea of family and community at their heart. \u201cThey\u2019re indicative of a country that is feeling miserable and uncertain,\u201d she says. \u201cWe all just want to enjoy ourselves when we can.\u201d That\u2019s why this year, Bason, the happiness guru, has hired a 60-piece female Welsh choir to feature as the centrepiece of her next festival. \u201cPeople want human connection,\u201d she says. \u201cPut a thousand people together, and they\u2019re bound to feel happy.\u201d Going micro The Legendary Llangollen Fairy Festival, 10-11 August Featuring storytelling, circus skills workshops and live music.
