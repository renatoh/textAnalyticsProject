Many within rugby league believe a season that is six weeks old will have to be dramatically altered or extended when Super League is given the green light to restart. The Leeds chief executive, Gary Hetherington, admits that with the Grand Final being held in October, it may now be 2021 before this season can be concluded. \u201cIt\u2019s inevitable we will have to extend the season; that may go to November, December or even beyond that ... who knows,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do whatever it takes to make this work and that may have an impact on the 2021 season, too.\u201d Hetherington added: \u201cI think there\u2019s a good chance the cup final will have to be played on a different date. We\u2019d have to find a new date and, who knows, maybe a new venue.\u201d He also warned there can be no complaints regarding player welfare when the season restarts and players are asked to play far more frequently than usual. \u201cWe have a rule where you can\u2019t play any earlier than five days after your last game but that\u2019s going to have to go out of the window. We will have to be playing three times a week. \u201cI\u2019ll be disappointed if I start hearing people whinging and using player welfare as an issue when it isn\u2019t. Player welfare is serious; it relates to stress, anxiety and mental health but we\u2019re talking about playing sport and rugby league is a tough sport.\u201d Some Super League executives have suggested relegation may have to be postponed owing to the extraordinary circumstances the sport finds itself in but Hetherington, who confirmed the majority of Leeds\u2019 150 players and staff have been furloughed, is keen to avoid that. \u201cI see it as a vital component of our competition,\u201d he said. \u201cWe saw last year how much drama promotion and relegation can add, and our competitions need to have as much as drama as possible. We certainly don\u2019t want to be doing anything that will take away a level of interest. However, if the season is disrupted it becomes an issue and we need to be mindful of that.\u201d Hetherington also said the remaining rounds of the Challenge Cup - there are 16 teams left - could be an opportunity for rugby league to provide some live sport for the country in the weeks ahead. \u201cWe\u2019re talking hypothetically because there\u2019s so much uncertainty but we\u2019ve got eight round-six ties to play and they could all be behind closed doors over a weekend,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could provide an opportunity for the game. If we were to be a sport providing live action when nobody else is, well that\u2019s an opportunity for rugby league to showcase itself.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
