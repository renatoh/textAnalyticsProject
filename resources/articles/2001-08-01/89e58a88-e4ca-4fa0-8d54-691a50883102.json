Big media players and financiers seemed to be queuing up to pay silly money for the creative talent and content locked up in the sector. Indie producers who had lived a hand-to-mouth business existence for years suddenly looked like getting rich quick. The subsequent collapse of technology, media and telecoms stocks and the advertising downturn has brought things back to earth with a bump. The TalkBack deal now looks like a very canny sale at the top of the market, rather than the start of a big bucks bonanza for the indie sector as a whole, as it was hailed by many at the time. Bad news for producers who had hoped to retire gracefully from the business after years of hard graft with a seven figure sum tucked into their belts. Most of the headline-grabbing deals involving indies in recent years have been trade sales to bigger players - TalkBack going to RTL, Carlton buying Planet 24, Ginger Media Group's sale to SMG, or Endemol acquiring Broadcast Communications, which owns Big Brother producer, Bazal. But for those who do not fancy becoming a tasty little canape for a media corporation just yet, the other option is to go and talk to venture capitalists. And for these people, the return of something approaching financial and commercial normality following the aberration of the dot.com boom provides more opportunity for investing in the indie sector, not less. Chris Graham, the director of media at venture capital firm 3i, says the valuations around last year came during a \"particular window\". \"I can't see those valuations coming back,\" Graham adds. \"The market is more stable now, which means you can conduct negotiations on a more sensible basis.\" Kevin Grassby, a director of another venture capital outfit, Sagitta Asset Management, adds that market conditions last year made it \"hard for folk like us\". \"It is fair to say that quite a lot of the guys we spoke to valued their businesses at a level that built in a lot of the hype,\" says Grassby. \"If you take away the hype, you can start to have conversation where traditional valuations apply.\" Both Graham and Grassby have made investments in independent production companies in the past six months. In Graham's case, \u00a35m went into Shine Entertainment, the new firm set up by Elisabeth Murdoch and Waheed Alli. Grassby put \u00a33m into RDF Media, the rapidly expanding company behind shows including Shipwrecked, Scrapheap Challenge and Banzai. They both see room for taking stakes in other companies in the sector, although in Graham's case he says it is more likely to take the form of Shine investing in other companies or content. Graham and Grassby agree the reason venture capitalists have begun to take more of an interest in the independent production sector is the changing balance of power between broadcasters and programme-makers as a result of the recent proliferation of channels. There is now more opportunity for indies to retain rights, move away from a cost plus business reliant on production fees and build more robust commercial operations. \"We look at sectors undergoing change that will produce winners and losers,\" says Grassby. \"Broadcasters' stranglehold on product seems to be relaxing. Some independents can now get better terms than cost plus.\" Graham adds: \"If a company can retain rights, be quite clever in how it manages risk and sells those rights, then it becomes a more attractive model for venture capitalists.\" The first thing venture capitalists look for when running the slide rule over a company is a strong management team. The next is the ambition and infrastructure to grow a business producing programmes that can become long running hits with international sales potential - thus maximising the revenue generating potential.\" Graham says: \"We're looking for producers that have the ambition and drive to be big and international. Not small cost plus indies.\" The US market is a particular target, he adds, because of its sheer size and the commercial opportunities that opens up. \"If you can straddle both the UK and US markets, the upside is so much higher. We're looking for companies and format-based content that can do that.\" Graham says 3i went with Shine because the company had a good balance between creative and business management and the \"ambition to be a big, global independent production business\". Grassby says: \"The worthy one-off might win awards, but as a financial product, it's not terribly interesting.\" He adds that Sagitta typically invests a minimum of \u00a32m. \"We're looking for already substantial businesses able to demonstrate they've got product that can sell, not people with an idea and a business plan and not much else.\" Grassby says he spoke to 25 to 30 indies, but RDF stood out because as well as having \"interesting product\", they seemed \"interested in building a broader-based business\". Other factors included the fact that managing director David Frank had trained as a lawyer and worked as a financier before moving into TV. He and the RDF management team were also used to thinking in terms of creating value for investors, because the company had been financed from the outset by two private backers. \"The management are more than just involved for lifestyle reasons,\" Grassby says. \"They have a responsibility not just to programme-makers, but to shareholders.\" He adds it is relatively easy to raise venture money, because there is a lot around looking for a home. The key thing for an independent producer is to find an investor with whom they share the same aims and can be \"comfortable bedfellows\". Sagitta and RDF talked for more than a year before finally signing a deal in April this year. Stephen Lambert, RDF director of programmes, says the \u00a33m Sagitta investment will be used principally to build up distribution arm RDF International by holding on to the rights to the company's own shows, but also by buying third-party rights. Lambert adds that RDF will also be able to take more risks on the programme-making side, by using the new money to hire creative talent - and cover the cost of their salaries for the period between the talent joining the company and securing new commissions. \"With production, there's a fixed percentage return,\" he says. \"With distribution, if you get the right product the margins are much higher.\" But bringing in the venture capitalists will not work for everyone. Tiger Aspect Productions, one of the leading UK indies and the producer behind shows including Mr Bean, Gimme Gimme Gimme and Teachers, has had approaches from venture capitalists and other media companies, according to joint managing director Andy Zein, but has chosen to remain independent. Rather than selling a stake or the whole business, Tiger Aspect has gone down the route of forging strategic partnerships, such as a film development deal with Working Title Films. \"We have ambitions that could be delivered more quickly with the right partner,\" Zein says. \"But we have found nothing yet that provided what we need to make our business bigger and better more quickly.\" He adds that one advantage of bringing in an investor, as opposed to another media company, is that they are more likely to leave you alone to get on and run the business. But the downside is that they will be looking to cash in their shareholding and realise a profit, exiting via a flotation or trade sale, usually within three to five years. Lambert says RDF is planning to float, because it is harder to fix the timing of a trade sale. He adds that in preparation for a flotation the company has brought in Richard Eyre, former ITV and Pearson TV chief executive, a figure well known to the City, as chairman. But Lambert reckons RDF is an exception in the indie sector, because it has been able to hold on to some rights and begin to develop programming brands, such as Scrapheap Challenge, with international potential. \"The average indie is unlikely to have any intrinsic value. They might make great programmes, even be quite profitable if they are well run, but it's still going to be hard to convince people you are worth investing in.\" Zein also has no illusions about how tough it is to attract venture funding to the independent sector. \"The bigger indies are proper businesses that can deliver a return. But that return is still somewhat less than in other sectors. That's the challenge - to up the return and learn to operate in new markets.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
