To ensure that all comparisons are as valid as possible, we ask each institution which of their students should be counted in each subject so that they will only be compared to students taking similar subjects at other universities. Nine statistical measures are employed to approximate a university\u2019s performance in teaching each subject. Measures relate to both input \u2013 for example, expenditure by the university on its students \u2013 and output \u2013 for example, the probability of a graduate finding a graduate-level job. The measures are knitted together to get a Guardian score, against which institutions are ranked. These Guardian scores have also been averaged across all subjects to generate an institution-level table. Changes introduced for 2020 The methodology employed in the tables has generally remained broadly constant since 2008 and after last year\u2019s introduction of the new continuation measure, there are only two small changes to this year\u2019s edition. 1. Integration of the new continuation measure The new continuation measure was introduced to the 2019 edition of the guide and combined data for two cohorts of first year students \u2013 those who were first-years in 2014-15 and 2015-16. This year\u2019s guide applies the same methodology and rolls the cohorts forwards, so that the measure refers to the first-years of 2015-16 and 2016-17. Now that the measure is established, the reporting thresholds that were in place for its introduction can be relaxed. In its year of introduction, a department needed to have 77 first- year students across the two most recent cohorts before a valid continuation score could be relied upon. This threshold has been relaxed to 65 and can now be spread across three years instead of two, provided that there were at least 35 first years in the two most recent years. In last year\u2019s edition, the continuation measure was added, where available, after the participation of departments had been determined on the basis of the usual metrics. This allowed for up to two metrics to be missing without the department being excluded from the rankings, with the three NSS metrics collectively counting as one. While justified as a means of introducing the new measure, this could potentially have led to strange situations: a department could have been missing the continuation metric, the three NSS measures and the career prospects score \u2013 collectively worth 50% of the total score \u2013 and still be ranked. But a department that missed the expenditure item, the tariff and the career prospects \u2013 collectively worth 35% of the total score \u2013 would have been excluded. Now that the continuation measure is here to stay, the process to decide whether or not to include a department in the rankings has been smartened up. Instead of counting the number of missing metrics, the influence of the missing metrics is totalled. A department missing metrics that are worth more than 40% of the total score is excluded. 2. The completion of the transition to the new Ucas tariff The 2016-17 cohort of university entrants were the first to have largely completed their level 3 qualifications under the new Ucas system of scoring qualifications. For the past two editions we have simulated this tariff based on the new scoring system and displayed the results, but in calculating the total score for each department we have referred to the actual Ucas tariff students entered with, based on the prevailing scoring system of the time. This year we are using the new Ucas tariff in all cases \u2013 both to calculate total scores and to display to users of the guide. Other indicators We look now at each of the other indicators of performance used in these tables. National Student Survey For all NSS metrics, we use data for full-time first-degree students who were registered at the provider. a. Satisfied with teaching During the 2018 NSS, final-year first-degree students were asked the extent to which they agreed with three positive statements regarding their experience of teaching in their department (a fourth question was introduced but is not being used in this Guide). The summary of responses to all three questions can either be expressed as a percentage who \u201cdefinitely agree\u201d or \u201cmostly agree\u201d, or be expressed as an average score between 1 and 5 where 5 relates to students who \u201cdefinitely agree\u201d and 1 relates to students who \u201cdefinitely disagree\u201d. The table gives an example of how a department of 30 students might have its data represented in the tables. b. Satisfied with feedback Students were also asked to reflect on four statements about how their efforts were assessed and how helpful any feedback was. The example data for questions 10 and 11 illustrates how the \u201caverage response\u201d statistic recognises differences in the distribution of responses, whereas the \u201csatisfaction rate\u201d statistic can be blind to them. This is the reason why average response is used to rank departments, even though the satisfaction rate is displayed in the tables. c. Satisfied with course Students were asked to answer a single question which encompasses all aspects of their course. Data relating to the NSS was not released at the Jacs level of detail, and results had to be weighted in order to approximate Guardian subject groups. The NSS data is published at three levels of subject granularity: level 3 data is most detailed and carries detail of 107 subjects, but results are suppressed where there are fewer than 10 respondents. Where this has happened, we substituted in results from level 2, which categorises students into 42 subjects. If any of these have fewer than 10 students, our first option is to use level 3 data from the 2017 NSS, otherwise level 2. The last resort is to use the broadest classification of subjects \u2013 level 1 \u2013 to get 2018 results for the 21 subject groups. We have not used data organised by the new common aggregation hierarchies and do not intend to do so until the Hecos transition takes place. Where we found that this process had produced a statistic based on under 23 respondents to the 2018 survey, we sought to produce the statistic at the same level but averaged over the 2017 and 2018 surveys, provided that a response population of 23 was reached across the two years. This procedure was also used for departments which had a response population of under 100, and which showed erratic year-on-year results. Continuation Our measure of continuation focuses on first-year students on full-time first-degree courses that are scheduled to take longer than a year to complete. We look ahead to the first of December in the following academic year, and observe the proportion who are still active in higher education. This proportion is viewed positively, regardless of whether the student has switched course, transferred to a different provider, or been required to repeat their first year \u2013 only those who are inactive in the UK\u2019s HE system are counted negatively. This proportion is displayed in the rankings, but when we determine the total score for each department, we take the expected proportion into account, meaning that a department will score higher if it helps a group of high-risk students continue their studies rather than if it retained a group of low-risk students. Some students enter higher education with a minimal risk of non-continuation, but we cap their expectation of continuation at 97% to reflect that even the most highly-qualified students have some risk of non-academic factors disrupting their studies. Our new measure of continuation combines data from two cohorts of first-years \u2013 those who were in the first years of 2015-16 and 2016-17 \u2013 and looks to the 1 December census points of 2016 and 2017 respectively in order to determine continuation status. For practical reasons, Hesa only provides continuation data for UK-domiciled students. Departments that had fewer than 6,577 first-years across the two cohorts are excluded, unless, when the earlier cohort of first-years in 2014-15 is added into the mix, the threshold of 65 is reached. There need to be at least 35 across the most recent two cohorts as well.. The new measure was not used to influence the overall scores in the rankings for medicine, dentistry or veterinary science because a) continuation is near 100% at all providers for these subjects and b) the value-added score that we use for those subjects already reward high retention. For other subjects the continuation measure determines 10% of the overall score. Value-added scores Based upon a sophisticated indexing methodology that tracks students from enrolment to graduation, qualifications upon entry are compared with the award that a student receives at the end of their studies. Each full-time student is given a probability of achieving a first or 2:1, based on the qualifications that they enter with or, if they are in entry bands 20 and 50, the total percentage of good degrees expected for the student in their department. If they manage to earn a good degree, then they score points that reflect how difficult it was to do so (in fact, they score the reciprocal of the probability of getting a first or 2:1). Thus an institution that takes in lots of students with low-entry qualifications \u2013 who are less likely to achieve firsts or 2:1s \u2013 will score highly in the value-added measure if the number of students doing so exceeds expectations. At least 30 students must be in a subject for a meaningful value-added score to be calculated using 2017-18 data alone. If there are more than 15 students in 2017-18 and the total number across 2016-17 and 2017-18 reaches 30, then a two-year average is calculated. This option could only be exercised when the subjects were consistent in definition between the two years. We always regard students who are awarded an integrated masters as having a positive outcome. A worked example shows how a value-added score could be calculated for a department of eight students. A variant of the value-added score is used in the three medical subjects: medicine, dentistry and veterinary science. This is because medical degrees are often unclassified. Unclassified degrees in medical subjects are regarded as positive, but the scope of the study population is broadened to encompass students who failed to complete their degree and who would count negatively in the value added score. Student-staff ratios SSRs compare the number of staff teaching a subject with the number of students studying it, to get a ratio where a low SSR is treated positively in the league tables. At least 28 students and three staff (both FTE) must be present in an SSR calculation using 2017-18 data alone. Smaller departments that had at least seven students and two staff FTE in 2017-18, and at least 30 students FTE in total across 2016-17 and 2017-18, have a two-year average calculated. This option could only be exercised when the subjects were consistent in definition between the two years. Year-on-year inconsistency and extreme values at either end of the spectrum have caused several SSRs to be suppressed or spread over two years. Caveat: This measure includes only staff who are contracted to spend a significant portion of their time teaching. It excludes those classed as \u201cresearch only\u201d but includes researchers who also teach, even though at research-intensive universities research can take up a significant proportion of their time. It follows that the simple ratio of the number of staff to students does not accurately reflect teaching intensity and also does not reveal who is performing the teaching. Is it the world-renowned professor or a graduate teaching assistant? Expenditure per student The amount of money that an institution spends providing a subject (not including the costs of academic staff, since these are already counted in the SSR) is divided by the volume of students learning the subject to derive this measure. Added to this is the amount of money the institution has spent on academic services \u2013 which includes library and computing facilities \u2013 over the past two years, divided by the total volume of students enrolled at the university in those years. Within each department, at least 30 (FTE) students must have been enrolled in 2017-18 for the expenditure per student to be calculated. Smaller departments must have had 20 FTE in 2017-18 and at least 30 FTE in total across 2016-17 and 2017-18 in order for a two-year average to be calculated. Year-on-year inconsistency or extreme values can also cause suppression (or spreading) of results. Entry scores Average tariffs are determined by taking the total tariff points of first-year, first-degree, full-time entrants who were aged under 21 at the start of their course, if the qualifications that they entered with can all be expressed using the tariff system. There must be more than seven students in any meaningful average and only students entering year 1 of a course (not a foundation year) with certain types of qualification are included. Departments that are dominated by mature entrants are not considered appropriate for this statistic because the age filter would capture and represent the entry tariff of only the minority of students. All tariffs are calculated using the new scoring system that Ucas established ahead of the 2017/18 cohort of entrants beginning their courses. Caveat: This measure seeks to approximate the aptitude of a prospective student\u2019s classmates. However, some institutions run access programmes that admit students on the basis that their potential aptitude is not represented by their lower tariff scores. Such institutions can expect to see lower average tariffs \u2013 but higher value added scores. Career prospects Employability is assessed by looking at the proportion of graduates who find graduate-level employment \u2013 and/or study at an HE or professional level \u2013 within six months of graduation. Graduates who report that they are unable to work are excluded from the study population, which must have at least 25 respondents to generate results. We generally seek to avoid using two-year averages for this measure, because the national economic environment that leavers find themselves in can have such a big effect on employment. Two-year averages are only applied when performance is erratic and the number of DLHE respondents is low. Subject tables Thresholds for inclusion Each subject table is driven by the nine indicators of performance. An institution can only be included in the table if the weighting value of any indicators that are missing add up to 40% or less, and if the institution\u2019s relevant department teaches at least 35 full-time, first-degree students. There must also be at least 25 students (FTE) in the relevant cost centre. Standardisation of scores For those institutions that qualify for inclusion in the subject table, each score is compared to the average score achieved by the other institutions that qualify, using standard deviations to gain a normal distribution of standardised scores (S-scores). The standardised score for student /staff ratios is negative, to reflect that low ratios are regarded as better. We cap certain S-scores \u2013 extremely high NSS, expenditure and SSR figures \u2013 at three standard deviations. This is to prevent a valid but extreme value from exerting an influence that far exceeds that of all other measures. Missing scores Where an indicator of performance is absent, a process introduces substitute S-scores. Total S-score and ranking The resulting S-scores \u2013 including those that have been substituted in \u2013 are weighted according to the values in the following table and added together. The published subject table The resulting total S-scores drive both the subject rankings and the institutional table, but are not displayed in the published subject table. Instead, the total S-scores are re-scaled so that the institution with the best S-score receives 100 points and all others get a lower (but positive) point score. This statistic appears in the published subject table, even though it is not subsequently used in the institutional table. In the published subject table, three of the indicators \u2013 entry scores, career prospects and student/staff ratios \u2013 are displayed in their pure form. The others, however, are not in a form that is inherently meaningful to readers. Rather than showing the average NSS scores that contribute to an institution\u2019s ranking, the printed table displays the \u201c% satisfied\u201d statistic because it is easier to grasp. Value-added scores are even less inherently meaningful, so the printed table displays these as points out of 10, with the following table converting the expenditure S-score into points: The same process is used to convert the \u201cexpenditure per student\u201d indicator into points. Under certain circumstances it is necessary to adjust the boundaries in order to ensure that each point score is possible to reach. Otherwise it would be impossible to only score 1 out of 10 in a situation where the average expenditure per student is less than 1.8 times the standard deviation of expenditure, because to do so would entail spending a negative amount per student. The new continuation item is displayed as the percentage of students who continue, but the continuation index, which takes expectations of continuation into account, is used to contribute to the total score without being displayed. Overall institutional table The institutional table ranks institutions according to their performance in the subject tables, but considers two other factors when calculating overall performance. First, the number of students in a department influences the extent to which that department\u2019s total S-score contributes to the institution\u2019s overall score. And second, the number of institutions included in the subject table determines the extent to which a department can affect the institutional table. The number of full-time undergraduates in each subject is expressed as a percentage of the total number of full-time undergraduates counted in subjects for which the institution is included within the subject table. For each subject, the number of institutions included within the table is counted and the natural logarithm of this value is calculated. The total S-score for each subject \u2013 which can be negative or positive \u2013 is multiplied by these two values, and the results are summed for all subjects, to give an overall S-score for each institution. Institutions are ranked according to this overall S-score, though the value displayed in the published table is a scaled version of this, that gives the top university 100 points and all the others a smaller (but positive) points tally. Each institution has overall versions of each of the indicators displayed next to its overall score out of 100, but these are crude institutional averages supplied by Hesa (or the NSS) that are otherwise disconnected from the tables and give no consideration to subject mix. Therefore these institutional averages cannot be used to calculate the overall score or ranking position. The indicators of performance for value-added and for expenditure per student are treated slightly differently, because they need to be converted into points out of 10 before being displayed. Therefore these indicators do read from the subject-level tables, again using student numbers to create a weighted average. Institutions that appear in fewer than eight subject tables are not included in the main ranking of universities. Subject suite review Prompted by Hesa\u2019s review of Jacs codes and cost centres, we undertook a significant review of which subjects have tables dedicated to them in the run-up to the 2016 edition of the Guardian University Guide. Our intention is to keep the new suite, described in detail here, as stable as possible until the new Hecos classification is introduced. Course directory The KIS database of courses, which institutions regularly update, is the data source for the courses that we list under each department in each subject group. We have associated every full-time course with one or more subject groups, based on the subject data associated with the courses, for which Hesa provided enhanced detail. We gave institutions the freedom to adjust these associations with subjects and also to change details of the courses. We include courses that are not at degree level, even though such provision is excluded from the data used to generate scores and rankings."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
