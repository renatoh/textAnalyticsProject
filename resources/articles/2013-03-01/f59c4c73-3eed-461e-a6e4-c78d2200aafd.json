But French's rewrite, while retaining Ibsen's plot, transposes the action to Edgbaston in 1962 and changes the characters' names. The result, while full of inventive detail, lacks the tragic resonance of Ibsen's original. French has certainly done his homework. He has the newly married Heather and her academic husband, George, moving into Neville Chamberlain's old house, within sight of the university. Birmingham's new Bull Ring is regarded with unironic awe: \"I expect in 50 years,\" says George, \"people will come to Birmingham just to admire the architecture.\" French's text is studded with local references. George, hoping to land the history professorship, hangs out with Malcolm Bradbury, while his rival, Alec Lambart, has been invited by Richard Hoggart to join the new Cultural Studies centre. And, just to remind us we're in 1962, the philandering local solicitor, Peregrine Brand, inveighs against Harold Macmillan's dismantling of the British empire. All this is amusing, but it doesn't reinforce the power of the original. Ibsen's Hedda is a woman trapped by character, circumstance and her inability to adjust to a changing world of gender equality; French's Heather just emerges as a bored suburban wife. Where you can believe Ibsen's Hedda would have settled for a respectable marriage, it becomes impossible to credit that Heather, especially as played by the glamorous Elisabeth Hopper, would have chosen to be a campus trophy. By relocating the action without changing the plot, French also makes you aware of the play's reliance on melodrama: Lambart's suicidal despair at losing both his self-respect and his manuscript seems wildly over-the-top, and even Heather's climactic self-destruction appears unlikely when she could have either changed her lawyer or hopped on a train at New Street. To put it simply, women had more choices in 1962 than in 1891. Mike Bradwell as director shows his usual ability to forge a company out of a disparate group of actors. Aside from Hopper's Heather, who looks remarkably like a young Christine Keeler, there is good work from James Bradshaw as her stolid hubby, Sean Hart as the fiery Lambart, who has left Hull for the fleshpots of Birmingham, and Christopher Ettridge as the wolfish Peregrine, who gets the biggest laugh of the evening by announcing, as he exits through the garden: \"Actually, I'm fond of back ways.\" That's not untypical of a version that is more lightweight campus comedy than inexorable social tragedy. \u2022 What have you been to see lately?
