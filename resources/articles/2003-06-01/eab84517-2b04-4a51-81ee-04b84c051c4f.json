In an interview in the Sports Illustrated magazine, published in New York yesterday, Ferguson speaks glowingly of Beckham as a dedicated professional, almost a workaholic, during his formative years at Old Trafford. But the United manager then speaks for the first time about his belief, often expressed in private, that Beckham became distracted after meeting his future wife and that his showbiz lifestyle might have changed his attitude towards football. \"He [Beckham] was blessed with great stamina, the best of all the players I've had here,\" said Ferguson. \"After training he'd always be practising, practising, practising. \"But his life changed when he met his wife. She's in pop and David got another image. He's developed this 'fashion thing'. I saw his transition to a different person.\" Ferguson went on to say that \"so long as it doesn't affect his football it doesn't bother me\". However, it has become clear that, despite the carefully orchestrated public relations exercise in which they both released statements detailing their mutual appreciation of each other, they were barely on speaking terms when Beckham concluded his transfer to Real Madrid. The player's father, Ted, said as much recently when he criticised Ferguson for not having spoken to the England captain \"for months\". This is not the first time that Ferguson has been critical of Victoria Beckham, or vice- versa. In the past she has made little secret of the fact that they rarely, if ever, speak, even at official club functions. Ferguson, in turn, has been dismayed by the frequency with which she has spoken of her desire to move abroad and for her husband to play for a big continental club."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
