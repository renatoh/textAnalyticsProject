Hoggard was ruled out of the first Test after suffering spasms in practice on Wednesday, and England, already without Steve Harmison for the three-match series because of a hernia, will monitor his progress before reassessing him on Monday. Should Hoggard fail to recover - and the short interval between back-to-back games leaves little room for manoeuvre - it will be the fifth Test he has missed in the last seven because of injury. That would represent a worrying reversal of fortune for a bowler who until recently was a byword for fitness, having played 40 successive Tests between March 2004 and the innings defeat at Melbourne in December 2006. If Hoggard's latest injury was entirely out of the selectors' hands, then the decision to give a first Test cap to Chris Tremlett ahead of the 21-year-old Leicestershire fast bowler Stuart Broad must have been a close-run thing. It had widely been expected that Broad would make his debut here after earning a place in the 13-man squad on Sunday and taking a career-best haul of five for 76 for the England Lions in their three-day game against India at Chelmsford. But Tremlett was added to the squad when Harmison's absence was confirmed on Monday and yesterday, to general surprise, he leapfrogged Broad to claim his place in the starting XI. The 6ft 7in Tremlett, who bowled with hostility in the Lions match, when he had Sachin Tendulkar dropped twice in quick succession on his way to 171, is known to have made an impression on the England coach, Peter Moores, when he bowled in the nets at Lord's on Tuesday. The management felt he looked comfortable with his new, shorter, run-up to the crease - a tactic he has used for the first time this summer - and they will also have taken note of the way he bounced out Sourav Ganguly cheaply at Chelmsford. Tremlett will hardly be concerned that his elevation ahead of Broad comes with the faint whiff of selectorial inconsistency, and now has the chance to dispel suggestions of a suspect temperament. England's batsmen reckoned his height and bounce made him the trickiest bowler in the nets during the summer of 2005, when he was named 12th man for the first four Ashes Tests, but he blotted his copybook with an insipid performance against New Zealand in a one-day international at Perth last winter. Now, at 25 and with only six one-day internationals caps, he has an opportunity to prove the doubters wrong."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
