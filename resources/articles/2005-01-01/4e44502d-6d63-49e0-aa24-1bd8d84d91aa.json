Lawrence's relegation-threatened Championship side face Blackburn on the back of a six-match unbeaten run, including a 1-1 draw at Ninian Park against Rovers 11 days ago, to set up the third-round replay. Few will give Lawrence's side much chance of confounding the odds against Mark Hughes' Premiership team, especially as the Welshman has engineered a revival since his appointment as manager. Rovers are now nine points clear of the relegation zone after losing only one of their last seven league games in which they have also managed five clean sheets. But Lawrence believes victory is not out of the question, saying: \"We go there in good heart and I can assure you we will give it a go. \"I know they don't let many in, but they don't score many either. It's the same for us at the moment, so it might be a tight one which could go to extra-time. \"We have to be mindful of that, but I know if we start against Blackburn like we did at Leeds [1-1 on Saturday] then we will be out of the Cup. \"If we put together a 90-minute performance like we we played in the rest of the game then we've a chance. Cardiff were run ragged by Leeds in the opening 20 minutes at Elland Road, with the home side taking a deserved 1-0 lead before Lawrence's team, finishing strongly, hit back to take a draw from a game they could have won. With Cardiff having an important home league game against Burnley on Saturday the replay is one match Lawrence could arguably do without. But the manager said: \"If we go out of the Cup, then we've a 15-day gap around fourth-round weekend. I don't want that, not the way we are playing, so I would like to keep things going.\" Lawrence is likely to be without the forward Cameron Jerome at Blackburn with a back injury and Alan Lee, who scored the equaliser in the initial game, is likely to come in. Chris Coleman will field his strongest possible Fulham side against Watford in their replay at Craven Cottage tonight. Andrew Cole returns up front after completing a one-match suspension but the midfielder Steed Malbranque is missing after suffering an ankle injury in Sunday's 1-0 victory over West Bromwich. He will be out for around three weeks. Another midfielder, Claus Jensen, and the defender Alain Goma are continuing their comebacks in the reserves. Watford's Ray Lewington is likely to make only one change from Saturday, with the 40-year-old Alec Chamberlain replacing the on-loan Paul Jones in goal. Wolves do not want to risk Jones becoming Cup-tied. Nevertheless, with his first-choice goalkeeper Richard Lee still injured, Lewington wants to extend the 37-year-old Wales international's loan by another month."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
