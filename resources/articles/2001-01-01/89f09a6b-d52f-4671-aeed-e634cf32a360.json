Shaun Goater's injury-time header settled the tie in favour of the home side after their Premiership relegation rivals had dominated for practically every minute of the 92 that had preceded it. The final whistle, which sounded almost immediately, was the cue for large numbers of visiting supporters to spill over into sections holding Manchester fans. The skirmish and stand-off that ensued doubtless looked worse than it actually was, but it was a throwback to the dark and distant days when crowd trouble was so often a given at English football matches. It was, presumably, a sufficiently unsavoury outbreak to warrant the attention of the FA and their new 'sleaze-busting' mandate, which, while aimed primarily at players and officials, encompasses all aspects of the national game. Maine Road has already been the subject of the FA's attention this season after David Beckham was struck by coins during the Manchester derby in November, although City were found to have no case to answer. The same will presumably be the case in this instance as Coventry's supporters did appear to instigate the trouble, a theory confirmed by City press officer Chris Bird. Bird said: 'From my view, at pitch level, it appeared that when Goater scored, Coventry fans moved into the area occupied by our fans. 'We will be waiting for the police report on Monday before making a comment. With this being an FA Cup tie we had to give a larger allocation than normal to the visiting club and you can never legislate for fans reacting in that manner. Nobody was badly hurt but arrests have been made.' Should the FA investigate the behaviour of Coventry's supporters, it will merely add insult to the injury of a thoroughly undeserved exit from the FA Cup. Manager Gordon Strachan is currently enduring the most testing period of his managerial career but with friends like Joe Royle around, he must surely be wondering if he is destined to see out the current campaign. The Manchester City manager was swift to approach Strachan after Goater had converted Tony Grant's corner following a rare Coventry lapse and he admitted: 'I apologised to him. He's a mate of mine and I feel for him in their current predicament. I just had to tell him that this was the first time this season we have got something we didn't deserve out of a game.' Small consolation for the Coventry manager who, for once in his eminently quotable career, was lost for words at the rank injustice of the outcome. 'I kept quiet in the dressing room,' said Strachan. 'I just told the players I was proud of them, they were fantastic. We were embarrassed last week against Everton yet this was the third time we've played City this season and that was the best we've played.' And the first time they had lost. For all his generosity, Strachan will know that his side should have added another victory to the away win and home draw they have already recorded against Royle's team this season. Marcus Hall, making his return from a four-month injury lay-off, proved such a productive attacking presence for Coventry in the first half that Royle was forced to totally reshape his side. John Eustace hit the post from Craig Bellamy's superb touch and came close on two further occasions. After the restart Bellamy continued to dominate, rounding Nicky Weaver only to be denied by Alfie Haaland's tackle. The game hinged on Goater's arrival as a 71st minute replacement for the hopelessly ineffective Paulo Wanchope, who hurled abuse at Royle as he stormed down the tunnel. His actions looked particularly pathetic after Goater's match-winning exploits although Royle was in the mood to forgive: 'Paulo was upset at being substituted, but then a lot of players are upset at being substituted.' For the sake of their friendship, Royle should hope Strachan is equally forgiving."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
