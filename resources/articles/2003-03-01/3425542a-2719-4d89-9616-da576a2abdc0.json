The South African rider, who nominates Richard Hughes as his inspiration, has been with the Baldings for just over a year and has had only seven rides in total, four of them in this country. \"He was pretty cool, you wouldn't have known it was his first winner,\" said Balding after Block had brought Tarawan from last to first to foil Eddery's attempt to make all on Danish Decorum. \"His father rang up when he was over in this country, so he found us rather than us finding him,\" added the trainer. \"He rides nicely and has done very well.\" Tarawan, who started 7-4 favourite, is making quite a name for himself as a schoolmaster for the Baldings, having provided the amateur rider Michaela Sowerby with her first winner at Doncaster last week. Earlier, Eddery rode one of his masterful waiting-in-front races on John Dunlop's four-year-old filly Living Daylights to win the Greyhound Handicap over a mile and a half. The daughter of Night Shift had cut little ice in four outings last season, but looked an improved performer as she saw off the challenge of Summer Bounty, who came from a fair way back to throw down a challenge at the furlong pole. Harry Dunlop, in his new role as his father's assistant at Arundel, said impending motherhood could have contributed to the improvement. \"Hopefully she's in foal to Averti and she could continue to race until the beginning of July,\" he said. \"That was a game performance and we're delighted.\" Trainer Clive Cox opened his account for the Flat turf season when Lago D'Orta took the Tote Placepot Handicap Stakes. The 11-1 shot confirmed the promise of his three placed runs as a two-year-old by stretching away from the joint-favourites High Reach and Grand Passion to score cosily in the hands of Dane O'Neill."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
