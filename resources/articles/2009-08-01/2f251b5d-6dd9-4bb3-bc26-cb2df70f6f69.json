It seems likely that Radiohead's new track, Harry Patch (In Memory of), would have pushed Get Shaky out of the Top 10, had its sales via radiohead.com counted towards the chart. Judging by web traffic analyser Alexa.com, the band's site has enjoyed an enormous spike in traffic since the track's surprise release last Wednesday. Given that the song - a stirring tribute to pacifist first world war veteran Harry Patch - is among Radiohead's most affecting work in years, it's a pity it didn't get the chart credit its quality and sales deserve. Anyone visiting radiohead.com to buy the song for \u00a31 (proceeds to the British Legion) might notice a link to a \"great dance music site\" called \n<a>DJhistory.com. That site actually began life in 2000 as a promotional tool for Last Night a DJ Saved My Life, the terrific history of disc jockeys by Bill Brewster and Frank Broughton. Since then, the pair have developed DJhistory into a welcoming home for all things dance, featuring interviews with a host of DJ legends, plus reviews of dance-related books, DVDs and, of course, music. Alongside its excellent written content, the site also offers a free weekly podcast. Plus, there's a streamable monthly mix by a guest DJ, with X-Press 2's Diesel dropping tracks like What's That You're Doing, by Stevie Wonder and Paul McCartney, into his decidedly eclectic new August mix. Dance fans are well-served for free online mixes these days, with numerous sites offering vast archives from a mind-boggling range of genres. The previously-mentioned play.fm remains one of the best (and most popular), with over 12,000 streamable DJ sets and radio shows. But two inter-related sites seem to be snapping at its heels. At MixUpload.com, you can trawl through more than 11,000 mixes that have been posted by DJs, with many also available to download in MP3 format, for free. The same mixes are also available to more casual users at mix.dj, where clicking one of 23 scrolling icons \u2013 labelled everything from \"funky house party\" to \"beach cocktail\" \u2013 takes you directly to a DJ set fitting that particular sonic bill. The website of south London dance label Rag &amp; Bone, ragandbonerecords.co.uk, has a modest 62 DJ sets in its mixes section, but the quality is high and they're all available as free MP3 downloads. Once you've checked out DJhistory's \"raving 89\" podcast, Warlock &amp; Noyeahno's acid house mix, packed with obscure 80s Chicago and Detroit house tunes, should lend your living room a sweaty warehouse vibe for 75 minutes.</a>"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
