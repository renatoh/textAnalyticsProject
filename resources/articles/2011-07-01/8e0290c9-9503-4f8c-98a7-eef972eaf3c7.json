MPs will debate the bill behind the mass cull of quangos for the second time on Tuesday when the shadow Cabinet Office minister, Tessa Jowell, will present evidence obtained via the Freedom of Information Act. The figures reveal that of the \u00a333bn the government says it will save from the quango reforms, just under \u00a32.6bn is from the administrative changes. The plans involved the axing of 192 bodies, the merger of a further 118 and the reform of 171, including the Health and Safety Executive, Charity Commission and the Environment Agency. The FOI document reveals that 90% of the total comes from direct spending on services and funding allocation by the quangos. Jowell, left, said: \"It beggars belief that [Francis] Maude has sought to present frontline cuts to housing and universities as savings from public bodies' reform. \"This deeply cynical use of figures shows the degree to which the Tory-led government cannot be trusted with our public services.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
