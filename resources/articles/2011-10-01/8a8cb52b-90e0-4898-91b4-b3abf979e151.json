Each episode is a short immersion into an argument triggered by something trivial. Last night's began with Kim asking Neil who a text message was from. Within moments, they were bickering: at first about whether they were in fact arguing. \"I'm niggled,\" Kim said. \"I would say I was post-niggled,\" Neil told her. From here it lurched, with horrible accuracy, into a full-scale, fast-escalating falling out. What distinguishes the writing here \u2013 and makes it regularly hilarious \u2013 is how Skinner captures the cliches and patterns of rows, their terrible predictability, but also their fuming weirdness. His couple are well-read, and so many of the insults are of a literary bent. \"Kim, you can go as DH Lawrence as you like,\" Neil snapped. \"You laughed in a Beckettian way because you see our relationship as a barren wasteland,\" she retorted. At various points, they both sang like a Greek chorus commenting on the spat. The programme also relishes the oddness of how relationships proceed over time. They end up considering a household ban on both the friend who sent the text message and celery, based on an earlier two-pronged resolution to another bitter tussle, \"the pornography and doughnut pact\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
