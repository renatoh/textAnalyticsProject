With emotions still raw in the Catalan capital following the car attacks that killed 13 people on Las Ramblas boulevard and another person in the town of Cambrils, the phrase \u201conly a game\u201d had rarely felt more appropriate ahead of the kick-off against Real Betis, which Barcelona won 2-0. But as Lionel Messi and his teammates took the field in black armbands, supporters and city officials alike highlighted the role the team could play in helping the city ease back into familiar routines at the end of three days of mourning. \u201cReturning to normality is a way of defeating those who want to disrupt normal life. Football is part of that,\u201d the Catalonian president, Carles Puigdemont, told the Guardian. At one end of the stadium, a block of several hundred supporters all wore black \u2013 rather than the normal colours of the Catalan flag \u2013 as a mark of respect. \u201cIt\u2019s just for today. We wanted to remember the victims. It is too sad,\u201d said one of them, who gave only his nickname, Chav. It is now a familiar scene, after similar memorials at football stadiums after attacks in Paris, Manchester and Dortmund. But Barcelona FC considers itself \u201cM\u00e9s que un club\u201d (more than a club) \u2013 a motto \u2013 that reflects the strong political and social influence of this sporting institution, which was a focus of Catalan independence aspirations during the military dictatorship of General Francisco Franco. More recently, it may have become better known for trophy triumphs, millionaire superstars and sponsorship deals with Qatar airlines and Rakuten, but it donates money to Unicef and it is the name of that children\u2019s charity that adorns the team\u2019s kit. \u201cBarcelona is a special club. I think at this moment, it can help the city. If people are afraid, they can come here. They can see how we overcome fear and move on,\u201d said a steward, Helena Helgarejo. Special shirts were produced for the opening game against Real Betis that bore the hashtag #TotsSomBarcelona (We are all Barcelona) on the chest. On the back, the players\u2019 individual names have been replaced by the collective \u201cBarcelona\u201d. Flags at the stadium have been flying at half-mast since the attack happened. As has been the case for all major sporting games in Spain this weekend, players of both teams wore black armbands and stood on the centre circle for a minute\u2019s silence \u2013 unusually accompanied by violin music over the tannoy. Although police stepped up security around the 99,000-capacity venue, Barcelona\u2019s manager, Ernesto Valverde, stressed that the overriding sentiment should be \u201cWe are not afraid\u201d \u2013 a phrase that has been echoed repeatedly since the attacks. \u201cWe have to stand up and the best way is by moving forward,\u201d the coach of the team said after a memorial service on Friday. \u201cWe all know the way the world is. We are all potentially victims at any given moment, whether it be going to the metro station or going to a football ground. But it\u2019s something you can\u2019t control and we can\u2019t hide.\u201d He noted how recent events have put the problems of the club (which was forced to sell one of its best players, Neymar, in the close season) in perspective. Many of those who came were foreigners who wanted to experience the Camp Nou \u2013 the home of a club with a global brand. Football, like tourism, is a global industry, and also a potential \u201csoft target\u201d for terrorists. Danish tourist Maja Ejsing said she had decided to come on the spur of the moment, despite a degree of unease. She and her boyfriend were staying in a hotel beside Las Ramblas on Thursday and saw people shouting. It was a shock that being in the crowd had helped to overcome. \u201cIt has been very touching in Las Ramblas to see people come out and stand up for their beliefs. My boyfriend asked me if we really wanted to go. There is some concern in the back of my mind, but life must go on.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
