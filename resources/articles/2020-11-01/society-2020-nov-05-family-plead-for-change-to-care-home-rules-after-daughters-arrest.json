Ylenia Angeli, 73, was detained by police after trying to remove her mother, who has dementia, from a care home in east Yorkshire. In distressing footage posted online, Angeli can be seen handcuffed inside a patrol car while her elderly mother, Tina Thornborough, is seated in the front of the family car. Humberside police later said they had responded to reports of an assault and Angeli was subsequently de-arrested and allowed home. Thornborough was returned to the care home in Market Weighton. Downing Street said it recognised there had been \u201cdistressing scenes\u201d during the arrest. Angeli\u2019s daughter, the former Coronation Street star Leandra Ashton, 42, who filmed the footage and could be heard sobbing in the background, described the situation as a Kafkaesque nightmare. Ashton had gone to the home with her mother for their final window visit after having no physical contact with her grandmother for nine months. She said: \u201cMy mum pushed into the care home to hug my grandma who has dementia. She then quietly wheeled her out. My mum is a trained nurse and wished to care for my nan at home, but we only have power of attorney for my nan\u2019s finances and not for her wellbeing, so my mum was arrested because she refused to take my nan back to the care home.\u201d Ashton said her family, who had written countless letters to MPs, the health secretary, Public Health England and the care home about visits to her grandmother, did not blame the police. She said: \u201cWhen you are repeatedly told \u2018we\u2019re just following the rules\u2019, and those rules have kept you away from your loved one for about nine months, you question those rules. The police were as kind as they could be, they had a hard job. I thank them for trying their best and de-arresting my mum. The issues are with the guidelines. \u201cWhen the rules \u2013 like so many in this period of our history \u2013 are purporting to be in place to protect but yet are causing untold damage to physical and mental health, then you start breaking the rules. I find myself for the first time in my life on the wrong side of the law.\u201d The government was forced into a last minute U-turn on Wednesday allowing care home residents visits from family members during the English lockdown. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, acknowledged it had been \u201cheartbreaking\u201d for families not to see loved ones. Less than three weeks ago the government had said visiting should be stopped in areas with tier 2 and tier 3 lockdown restrictions, apart from in exceptional circumstances such as the end of life. Ashton called on the government to go further, giving relatives key-worker status so they could visit regularly. She said: \u201cThey need to be allowed into their relative\u2019s private bedroom to visit, feed and care for their loved ones. It is my hope that if enough of us live from our hearts, act from our hearts and speak our truth fearlessly from our hearts, this inhumane situation will come to an end.\u201d Humberside police\u2019s assistant chief constable, Chris Noble, said these were incredibly difficult circumstances and his force sympathised with all families in this position. He said: \u201cWe responded to a report of an assault at the care home, which is legally responsible for the woman\u2019s care and who were concerned for her wellbeing. As was our legal duty, we returned the lady to the home, and a 73-year-old woman who was initially arrested was de-arrested and allowed to return home with her daughter. \u201cWe understand that this is an emotional and difficult situation for all those involved and will continue to provide whatever support we can to both parties.\u201d A Downing Street spokesman said: \u201cWe absolutely understand how difficult the current situation is for families and those with loved ones in care homes, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re publishing new guidance to enable more visits to take place.\u201d The spokesman said there was not a \u201cone-size-fits-all answer, unfortunately,\u201d on whether families could take their loved ones out of care homes. \u201cBut it does have to be done in a way that\u2019s Covid-secure because of the risk to residents, family members and staff, and we need to ensure they are kept safe,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
