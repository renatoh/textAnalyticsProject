Get ready for a broken fucken arm. Face up.\u201d It\u2019s hardly \u201chow\u2019s your wife and my kids?\u201d but Michael Clarke\u2019s sledge on Jimmy Anderson is no less memorable or quotable. And it is \u201cfucken\u201d, by the way. For all the calculation and assuredness of Clarke\u2019s media performances there\u2019s no hiding that broad Strine, especially not in the heat of an Ashes Test where its blunt cadence draws a symbolic battle line of its own. \u201cOn the pitch it\u2019s pretty much war, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said the England captain, Alastair Cook, when queried as to the appropriateness of Clarke\u2019s remarks. Those of a gentler disposition might also view Cook\u2019s statement as an affront but in admonishing his opposite number it also masked a counter-punch. It spoke of a captain looking out to the horizon rather than one who can\u2019t help but keep one eye on the carnage slowly disappearing in the rear-view mirror. Australia should take satisfaction from the opening encounter, but they merely won a battle at Brisbane. England are hemmed in but far from beaten and they know an escape route or two. It\u2019s why they\u2019ve barely lost a Test series in the last half-decade. It\u2019s why Australia hasn\u2019t taken one off them in six years. In their own unique ways, Clarke, his now-menacing paceman Mitchell Johnson and David Warner all put the resultant scars on display in Brisbane. It mightn\u2019t be anything as dramatic as an inferiority complex but the Australians didn\u2019t look like a team who were used to the act of winning on Sunday. In nine Tests previous they didn\u2019t so we can hardly blame them for that. Johnson left Jonathan Trott a deflated and beaten man after the series opener but Australian body language told an equally compelling story. The old Australian Ugliness has returned and for now it\u2019s a welcome sight down under. A nation that has spent so long berating its team for the frequency and calamity of their losses can hardly turn around and complain about the way they win. Clarke alone has weathered much of the criticism in the down times through both the incapability or unwillingness of others to share the burden. Brad Haddin\u2019s return to the fold has clearly been of comfort to him and not just for his game-turning runs in Brisbane. For Clarke, Haddin\u2019s presence has equated to one less thing to worry about or explain away. This time around Clarke was able to express himself in a counter-attacking century that has appeased if not completely silenced critics of his back-foot play. Even facing up to Stuart Broad is a much more comfortable position for the Australian captain than sitting in front of a microphone though. During that second innings Clarke knew what was coming and dealt with it. He\u2019d take equal satisfaction that Johnson, David Warner and Nathan Lyon vindicated his lavish pre-match praise and loyalty. He\u2019d also be wary that the first two of them are never far from self-destructing. It\u2019s ironic that neither of the two remarks that have most nakedly revealed a streak of ruthlessness in Clarke\u2019s leadership was meant for public broadcast. Both the leaked Shane Watson \u201ccancer\u201d remarks and the Anderson tiff have given us an insight into the no-frills outlook of the Australian captain these days. It\u2019s not an impression you ever get from his opaque press conferences or even the far from revelatory pre-recorded interview with his friend Shane Warne that aired as rain tumbled down late on day four. As rough and unguarded as Clarke\u2019s remarks were in both cases, they actually share some DNA with his opposing captain\u2019s reflections after the match. Where they differed was that Cook was happy to publicly accuse the Australians of stepping out of line. On the surface that could easily be labeled whingeing but Cook was also just calling it as he saw it. Both add their own layers to a rivalry that is certainly not friendly and we should be equally thankful that Cook\u2019s candor was delivered for the public record. The Aussies now find themselves the hunter rather than the prey. It\u2019s unfamiliar territory for many of them and whether they\u2019re able to press home the advantage remains to be seen. It requires a different mindset now and unstinting application. Recalibrations will be needed along the way. Energy and brute force caused two monumental England batting collapses in Brisbane but different gears will be required elsewhere. In the time it has taken Clarke\u2019s side to finally win a Test they\u2019ve seen teammates suspended and sent into purgatory, a very public spat between their captain and now ex vice-captain, not to mention the sight of a coach being thrown onto the scrapheap. None of it has bred confidence or security so that roiling boil was bound to flow over at some point. Cook and his men now face a 10 day lay-off to take stock and formulate a riposte. Clarke could be forgiven for wanting to just make them face up now."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
