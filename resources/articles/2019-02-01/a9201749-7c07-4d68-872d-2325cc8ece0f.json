In addition to leading England and being a world-class goal-kicker it now emerges he is good at barbecues. \u201cHe loves them,\u201d Vunipola said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a very nice one with a lot of compartments and you can control the temperature via his phone. Instead of being out there in the rain he can do it from inside.\u201d Sadly this clever technology is not yet on offer to international fly-halves on Saturday afternoons; if Farrell wishes to turn up the heat on Ireland at the Aviva Stadium he must do so in person. This fixture would be seriously difficult even if his father, Andy, was not the Irish defence coach. Given the family dimension and the ongoing scrutiny of his tackling technique, a major test of character awaits. The Irish back row, in particular, will be less concerned about his favourite grilled meats \u2013 \u201cHe\u2019s cooked me a beef brisket which was very nice,\u201d reported Vunipola \u2013 than getting under his skin. This week the former Irish scrum-half Peter Stringer suggested Farrell was a \u201chothead\u201d who would be targeted by the home team. \u201cI\u2019ve played with him and he loves that physical side of things but you can get under his skin, you can rattle him,\u201d Stringer said. \u201cHe is a guy they\u2019ll be looking to get after.\u201d It remains one of rugby\u2019s more striking contradictions that the man with the steadiest of assassin\u2019s temperaments as a kicker can be found raging about some perceived injustice barely 30 seconds later. No one is suggesting the 27-year-old should take a monastic vow of silence but of late he has rubbed up more than one referee the wrong way. On the eve of such an intense fixture, nevertheless, Farrell insists Stringer\u2019s perception of him is slightly outdated. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long ago it is I played with Strings; it seems like a long time ago. I don\u2019t know if he thinks I\u2019ve not changed. He\u2019s entitled to his opinion. I\u2019m competitive, I\u2019ll look to do my job on the field and that\u2019s all that matters.\u201d If he was ever a hothead, in other words, the red mist is less frequent nowadays. \u201cI can\u2019t remember that person and I don\u2019t need to. Everyone has changed, haven\u2019t they? Everyone tries to get better, everyone tries to grow. I\u2019m happy with how I am and the way things are going.\u201d He is equally keen to emphasise that Celtic teams do not have a monopoly on passion. \u201cIt\u2019s always a balance \u2026 being clear-headed but being aggressive and as combative as you need to be.\u201d Coming away from major venues in Ireland with a victory, even so, has not been an English speciality lately at Test or provincial level and Farrell accepts the visitors will have to keep cool. \u201cIt\u2019s a passionate place with a passionate crowd and they\u2019re a passionate team. You\u2019ve seen from those big Munster nights and the big Leinster nights in Dublin how tough those places are to go. That probably says you need to get your start right, stick in the fight and take it to them. They\u2019re a tough team and it\u2019ll be a tough game but we can\u2019t wait to play them.\u201d At least those English players who have previously worked under Farrell Sr have a fair idea of what is coming. Their Australian backs coach, Scott Wisemantel, has revealed the visitors have \u201ctapped into\u201d the experience of Steve Borthwick, who coached alongside Farrell on the 2017 Lions tour, but England\u2019s backs also believe attack could be their best form of defence. \u201cWe want to come and fire some shots,\u201d said the winger Jonny May. \u201cWe\u2019ve been practising our gameplan for 10 days and we know what we want to do. Do we want to have a go at them? Of course we do.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
