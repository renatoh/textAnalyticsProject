The win moved him another step closer to achieving his goal of qualifying for the Masters Cup in Houston. Moodie's serve was devastating for much of the match and, though the rest of his game did not quite match up, he played far better than his world ranking of 170. Henman did not always serve like a world No4 but his forehand and volleys were mostly worthy of his position as the highest seed left in the tournament. \"It's tough to keep your self-belief when a guy is serving like that because one lapse of concentration can cost you a set,\" said the British No1. \"But on the other hand it adds to the satisfaction when you come through it.\" A Swiss newspaper carried an interview with Henman in which he mourned the death of serve and volley. Anyone who read that and watched him and Moodie chip and charge - Henman managing the only break of serve in the final game - would be forgiven for thinking he was having a giggle at their expense. Henman said afterwards that he felt fine despite the match's gruelling nature, but his demeanour on court suggested that even if the magnesium tablets he has been taking have helped his energy, they have not yet cured the irritability, twitchiness or PMT - Pre Masters Cup Tension. That is because he could be overhauled in the race to Houston despite being in one of the last remaining qualifying places. \"It's pretty easy at this time of year to get sucked into who's doing what and that's something I've tried to stay away from,\" he said. \"It's easier said than done, but if you win your matches then all the other bits and pieces will take care of themselves.\" He can ease some of the stress by beating Jiri Novak today but he can put his qualification beyond doubt only by reaching the final."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
