Pixar, the CGI animation people who are now an independent branch of the Disney organisation, has revived this tradition and, in doing so, shows respect for cinematic tradition and for their audiences, as well as that admirable quality, self-respect. One of its earliest pictures was the short film Luxo Jr about a playful desk lamp, which has now been incorporated into its logo, and it now invariably has a short as a curtain- raiser to its features. So before its latest masterly feature, Wall-E, there's its latest masterly short, the five-minute Presto directed by Douglas Sweetland, about the relationship between Presto DiGiotagione, a traditional stage musician of the early 20th century, and his rabbit, Alec Kazam. The simple plot turns on the fact that the hungry Alec wants a carrot and the conjuror is too preoccupied with putting on his act at an enormous theatre to feed him. So the cunning bunny screws up the show but the catastrophes he engineers only lead to greater applause. Eventually, Presto, after nearly being killed, gives Alec his carrot and equal billing at their next appearance. After this bright, fast, hilarious, beautifully drawn hors d'oeuvre, I almost needed a rest before the main course. The Greek poet Archilochus said: 'The fox knows many things but the hedgehog knows one big thing.' Inspired by this epigram, Isaiah Berlin divided writers and thinkers into hedgehogs and foxes. You could say that Presto is a hedgehog movie and Wall-E a fox movie. Directed and co-scripted by Andrew Stanton, who's been associated with Pixar since Toy Story and here heads a team larger than many a United Nations peacekeeping force, Wall-E is a science- fiction epic set 700 years in the future. It consciously draws on a tradition of apocalyptic, dystopian sci-fi pictures from When Worlds Collide through 2001 to Stars Wars, all of which are invoked, often comically. Wall-E, pronounced Wally and an acronym for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class, is that familiar Robinson Crusoe figure, the last occupant of Earth. A multinational corporation, Buy n Large, has been responsible, so we infer, for all the waste and pollution on our planet. As a result, Buy n Large's CEO, a bland hypocrite with the appropriate name of Shelby Forthright, has whisked away the human beings for a cruise on the luxury starship Axiom, leaving robots to clean up the planet. Wall-E, now rusty, run-down and constantly repairing himself, has worked steadily over the centuries, compacting rubbish and piling it into giant pyramids on his arid urban wasteland. We soon discover he's developed a personality of his own as he sorts out things worth preserving from the endless waste of society. These little treasures include a Rubik's Cube, a light bulb, a hand-whisk and, above all, a VHS copy of the 1969 musical Hello, Dolly!. From watching this film, he learns to dance and to hold hands. Very soon, we feel lovingly sympathetic towards the diligent, lonely Wall-E (whose only company is a jolly cockroach). Wall-E belongs to those creations of scientists and artists like Frankenstein's monster and the androids in Blade Runner, Geppetto's Pinocchio and Pygmalion's Galatea, who become vulnerably human. As in all Pixar movies, things and animals are all kinder, more likable than the humans they encounter. The passengers on the starship Axiom have become lazy, passive, obese and incapable of action or unassisted movement due to their pampered existence. Wall-E, indeed, is being set up to become the saviour of humanity, which comes about when this lonely Adam is introduced to his new Eve (Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator), a robot sent to Earth from Axiom to see if a return of so-called civilisation is possible down here. She's a gleaming, polished object resembling a production-line version of a Brancusi egg. White and pristine, she floats above the ground, unlike the rusty, sharp-edged Wall-E, who grinds around on caterpillar tracks. Wall-E is smitten and wants to hold hands like Michael Crawford and his girl in Hello, Dolly! He cares for Eve and they converse in their computer language. When she discovers a small green plant that Wall-E has kept, the vital sign of life on Earth, she's picked up by a rocket. He clings to this capsule and is taken back to Axiom. The second part of the film, in which the maverick Wall-E stirs up a slave revolt and makes the complacent, exiled Earthlings aware of their humanity, is more conventional than the first part, though lively and exciting enough. Interestingly, the film has become oddly controversial in the States. Its humane message and concern for ecology have been criticised in conservative quarters as a left-wing attack on corporate neglect and the depredations of big business. Cute is OK, but Kyoto isn't. The movie is constantly inventive in its inspired graphics and comic detail. Its warnings of a desperate, dying future world have a haunting realism far more powerful than the violent frenzy of equivalent scenes in Japanese anime films bent on showing the horrors of things to come. There is also a beautiful ending where we see the world rejuvenated. It's nothing like the famous scientific transformation of a ravaged future London into a gleaming modern city that so impressed audiences seeing the film of HG Wells's Things to Come back in the 1930s. In Wall-E, Andrew Stanton turns the polluted brown-and-grey America, to which the cruise passengers on Axiom return, into the vibrantly coloured world of Turner, Seurat, Monet and van Gogh, a triumph of art and the hand rather than of science and the machine. The experience, far from being corny or sentimental, is romantic and exhilarating."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
