Delivering her findings over livestream on Thursday, coroner Caitlin English said she made the recommendation after considering the evidence surrounding the 55-year-old Yorta Yorta woman\u2019s death. \u201cI believe an indictable offence may have been committed in connection to Ms Day\u2019s death,\u201d English said. She recommended that the Coroner\u2019s Act be amended to give coroners more control over the investigation, conducted by police, that informs an inquest. She also recommended that a falls risk assessment be placed in the Victoria police manual\u2019s guidelines for holding people in custody, that police training be updated with reference to the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody, and that both the Victoria police and V/Line transport training manuals be subject to an independent human rights review. She also repeated an earlier recommendation, made at the first hearing of the inquest in December 2018, that the crime of public drunkenness be abolished in Victoria, to which the Andrews government has already agreed. Day died in hospital on 22 December 2017 of a brain haemorrhage sustained when she fell and hit her head in the cells of Castlemaine police station 17 days earlier. She was in the cells because she had been arrested for public drunkenness, after being removed by police from a V/Line train from Bendigo to Melbourne. English said Day\u2019s family had asked her to consider whether the circumstances of her death amounted to negligent manslaughter. She said the medical evidence suggested Day had only a 20% chance of survival, and even then with severe disabilities once she had fallen and sustained a haematoma in the police cells, so that \u201cany inadequacies of [police] care of Ms Day was not causative of her death\u201d. But she said the issue of preventing her death was not limited to medical care after her fall. \u201cMs Day\u2019s death was clearly preventable had she not been arrested and taken into custody. \u201cThe totality of the evidence inclines me to assenting to a belief that an indictable offence may have been committed,\u201d English said. \u201cAnd on this basis I intend to direct that the principle registrar must notify the director of public prosecutions.\u201d The finding was delivered over livestream because of restrictions to in-person hearings due to the coronavirus. Three of Day\u2019s four children watched the finding together in Wodonga. They had earlier called for a criminal investigation into negligence by police. The 14-day inquest into Day\u2019s death, conducted in Melbourne last year, was the first coronial inquiry into a death in custody in Australia to consider whether systemic racism was a causative factor. English found that the police officers who took Day off the V/Line train at Castlemaine station and arrested her for public drunkenness treated her differently than they did another, non-Indigenous, severely intoxicated woman later that same day, who was driven home by police and not arrested or even fined for being drunk in public. But English said:\u201cI am not of the view there is evidence to make a finding the differential treatment was due to Ms Day\u2019s Aboriginality.\u201d However, she said the decision of the train conductor, Shaun Irvine, to call police to remove Day from the train was influenced by unconscious bias. He initially described Day as \u201cunruly\u201d but said under cross-examination that she was not aggressive or disruptive. English said: \u201cShe was the only sleeping passenger he has ever called police to remove from the train, although he comes across three sleeping passengers a week. \u201cThe combination of this evidence suggests it is open to me to draw the inference that Mr Irvine\u2019s decision making was influenced by unconscious bias \u2026 I find the decision to consider her unruly and to call police in preference to other options was influenced by her Aboriginality.\u201d English said that Sergeant Edwina Neale and leading senior constable Danny Wolters, who were responsible for the police lock-up on the afternoon that Day was brought into custody, had \u201cdemonstrated a cultural complacency toward people who were drunk\u201d and not complied with police guidelines. She said Day was \u201cnot treated with dignity and humanity\u201d in accordance with the Victorian charter of human rights. CCTV footage showed Day fell five times while in the cell. The most significant fall occurred just before 5pm \u2013 less than an hour after she had been placed in the cell and more than three hours before police noticed a lump on her head and called an ambulance. That blow, the inquest heard, caused a significant haematoma on her left temporal lobe. The next welfare check, conducted by leading senior constable Danny Wolters at 5.35pm, consisted of him looking through the window in the cell door for about three seconds. Wolters denied a suggestion, made by lawyers for Day\u2019s family at the inquest, that he had been \u201ccriminally negligent\u201d. English said she did not find Wolters to be a \u201ccredible witness\u201d and that the comments he and Neale made during the inquest \u2013 that Day was a drunk person acting as drunk people do \u2013 were concerning. \u201cThis illustrates the power of stereotype and its resistance to correction,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the required physical checks had been conducted every 20 minutes or every 30 minutes \u2026 it may well be that Ms Day\u2019s deterioration was detected earlier.\u201d Day\u2019s daughter, Apryl Day , said the finding was \u201cbittersweet\u201d. She is grateful the matter was referred to the DPP but frustrated that the coroner found that police had not been influenced by racism. Day said she believed police were dismissive of her mother\u2019s condition in the police cells not just because she was drunk but because she was \u201can Aboriginal person drunk in a cell\u201d. Police officers denied their conduct towards Day was influenced by her Aboriginality, and English said cross examination on this subject \u201cyielded denials\u201d. \u201cUnsurprisingly, no witnesses admitted to holding racist beliefs,\u201d English said. Day said her family was preparing for the next stage of the legal proceedings. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a relief that the truth of what happened to Mum has been told in the sense of acknowledging the unconscious bias from V/Line, acknowledging that Mum\u2019s death was preventable and that she really should have never been in that cell,\u201d Day said. \u201cAlso that we have been asking for them to refer them to the DPP so they can be held accountable, and she has heard that in our submissions and she\u2019s going to refer them. \u201cSo we\u2019re definitely thankful for what the process has brought. But we also acknowledge that this is just one part and now we have to gear up for another fight.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
