With intelligent insight, Opera by Definition have decided to be radically different, moving Tchaikovsky and Pushkin's searing tale from 1812 to the present day. When Tatyana first meets Onegin in Russian rural tranquillity it's all empire-line dresses and frock coats, but by her name-day celebrations, the action has moved to 1870. By act three we are in the Fifties - satin ballgowns and thin-lapelled black tie - and finally, when Onegin realises what a fool he was to reject Tatyana, he's in a linen suit and she's in a comfy cardie. The message is simple: rejection is a universal, timeless experience. This production rips along, tightly directed by Francesca Gilpin and conducted con brio by David Macdonald. James Cleverton lends just the right note of haughty disdain to Onegin; Anthea Kempston's Tatyana is charmingly affecting and wonderfully sung; James Edwards's Lensky bristles with indignation; and Marie Elliott Davies, as Olga, is a revelation. Opera by Definition show what heights a professional company can achieve on a tight budget and in a small space. They are planning Handel's Tamerlano next year - it should be a winner."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
