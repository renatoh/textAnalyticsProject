The draw gleaned by Marcus Bent's last-minute equaliser at Southampton on Sunday put Everton five points clear of their city rivals in fourth place. Though David Moyes insisted his side should concentrate on closing the gap to Arsenal in third rather than worry about Liverpool at their back, local focus is already on a potentially pivotal trip to Anfield on March 20. \"For the fans and everybody associated with the club it would be unbelievable to finish above Liverpool, no matter if that meant 15th and 16th - just to finish above Liverpool,\" said McFadden, who is with the Scotland squad in Cheshire. \"To finish above them would mean much more than getting into the Champions League. \"All the people who work at Everton are Evertonians and they're always looking at the Liverpool score. We're a few points ahead even of the other teams who are competing for the European places so, at the very least, we're hoping to get into the Uefa Cup. But there's no reason why we can't keep up our form and get into the Champions League.\" It is 20 years since Everton last completed a league double over Liverpool, and 17 since they finished above their local rivals. McFadden did not feature in December's 1-0 victory at Goodison Park but has since emerged from his inconsistencies to conjure his most prolonged spell of productive form since moving from Motherwell in August 2003 for \u00a31.25m. He has scored three times in his last five starts - his first goals for the club - to reflect better his performances for Scotland, for whom he has scored six times in 19 appearances. Now established in the side after losing his starting place after the opening-day defeat to Arsenal, his is a career reborn. \"People doubted me at times and wondered whether I could hack it down here,\" admitted the 21-year-old. \"It was up to me to prove people wrong, though first and foremost I wanted to prove to myself that I can do it here. After that Arsenal game I was low on confidence and wasn't enjoying it as much as I had been before. Sometimes, in training, you ask yourself, 'Why am I doing this, because I'm not going to play at the weekend'. \"But I came through that and I never considered going back up the road [to Scotland]. I want to prove I can play in the Premier League. The manager's been great with me, but everybody else has been great to me as well, telling me to keep believing in myself. \"What happened to us last summer, with Wayne Rooney's sale and everything, made us all realise we had to pull together because people were convinced we were going to be relegated. We've done ever so well to bounce back from that and go on the run we have done. If we lost every game from now until the end of the season, it would still have to be considered as a success [because we've stayed up]. I just hope that doesn't happen.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
