The Gunners have not only gone out of Europe but also lost an FA Cup semi-final, the League Cup final and seen their Premier League crown whisked away by Fulham. \"We've given it our best shot in every competition,\" said their manager Vic Akers, \"but unfortunately we've come up short in all of them and that's a major disappointment.\" Akers's team will end the season bereft of silverware for the first time since 1996. At Barnet's Underhill Stadium yesterday, Birgit Christensen's sixth-minute goal stretched Fortuna's aggregate lead to three goals and effectively put the game beyond Arsenal's reach. Christina Bonde, whom Arsenal tried to sign at the start of last season, scored a penalty two minutes into the second half and then added another. The Australian midfielder Sharon Black made it 4-0 before Angela Banks hit a consolation effort for the home side. The For tuna substitute May Christensen completed the scoring in stoppage time. \"The better team have gone through to the final,\" Arsenal's captain Jayne Ludlow admitted. \"They're the best club team I've ever played against and our girls have got to aspire to get to their standards.\" Southampton Saints were relegated from the Women's Premier League top flight after a 3-1 defeat by Fulham, crowned champions after their 2-0 victory at Everton on Thursday. Also down are Brighton, who drew 2-2 at Leeds United. Charlton Athletic - Fulham's opponents in next week's FA Cup final - beat Birmingham City 3-2 thanks to a hat-trick from the England striker Amanda Barr."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
