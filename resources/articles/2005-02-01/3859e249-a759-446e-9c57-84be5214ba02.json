Mr MacKenzie, the chairman and chief executive of the Wireless Group, has challenged Rajar to admit its TalkSport station has more than double the audience Rajar says it has. The former Sun editor said Rajar has kept secret the results of electronic measurement tests in 2002/3 that gave TalkSport a weekly audience reach of 14%, and 17% reach when measured by Gfk's wristwatch and Arbitron's meter. The figures compare with the 4% reach TalkSport is assigned under Rajar's current diary system. This is the figure that is used by advertisers to decide where to place their ads. \"I challenge Rajar to deny these figures,\" said Mr MacKenzie. \"This, after all, is what the whole argument is all about... and these figures are theirs not ours; they're from their own tests that they devised and that they commissioned, administered and oversaw. \"The fact is that TalkSport is going great guns and Rajar knows it, but they won't admit it.\" Rajar has confidentiality agreements with the meter manufacturers, which bar it from revealing the results of the test, which are due to end in 2007 when the diary system will be replaced by a new electronic audience measurement method. But Mr MacKenzie said the official ratings body was hiding behind these agreements. The Rajar managing director, Sally De La Bedoyere, was unavailable for comment at the time of publication. This latest attempt to establish that TalkSport's audience is higher than Rajar's official figures comes just two months after the high court threw out the Wireless Group's lawsuit against Rajar. Mr MacKenzie claimed that Rajar's diary system was outdated and had consistently under-reported TalkSport's audience, costing the company more than \u00a360m in lost advertising revenue. However, Mr Justice Lloyd yesterday agreed with Rajar, which brought an action to have Mr MacKenzie's case struck out on the grounds that it had no legal foundation. The judge dismissed the central plank of the Wireless Group's case as \"impossible to see\". The judge concluded that the Wireless Group's claim had \"no reasonable prospect of success\". However, he acknowledged: \"It may be fair to say that each of the audiometers [electronic measurement systems] is much better than the diary system, but that does not help with the decision about which of the audiometers to adopt.\" Yesterday Mr MacKenzie saw his proposed management buyout of the Wireless Group collapse after New York-based private equity backers Veronis Suhler Stevenson withdrew. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
