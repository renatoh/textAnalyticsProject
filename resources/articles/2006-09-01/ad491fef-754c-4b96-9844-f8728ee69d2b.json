As hosts, Germany were seeded direct to the World Cup finals. But now they must earn their right to a place in Austria and Switzerland in two years' time. Ballack added: \"We have many young players who have never played a qualifying campaign. Qualifying is something very different from a World Cup at home. That was a gift to us. Now, we have to keep our feet firmly on the ground. The alternative is a nasty surprise.\" J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann stepped down as national coach after Germany finished third at the World Cup, leaving the team in the care of his erstwhile assistant Joachim L\u00f6w. He led Germany to a 3-0 rout of Sweden on his debut last month. When he took over, L\u00f6w said his goal was to win Euro 2008 but Ballack warns against complacency. \"Qualifying will be hard enough,\" he said. \"Away games against Slovakia, Wales or Ireland are not going to be a piece of cake. Once we have achieved that goal, only then can we say we want to win the title. I am sure we can qualify but this is football and you never know what can happen.\" Ballack, who missed the game against Sweden because of a hip injury, is likely to take up a defensive midfield position similar to his World Cup role. But Per Mertesacker and Christoph Metzelder, the two central defenders, are injured so Germany's shaky and inexperienced defence has had to be reshuffled. Arsenal's goalkeeper Jens Lehmann also warned: \"There are some very good players in the Ireland squad. It's going to be anything but easy.\" But his team-mates hope Stuttgart will again prove a lucky stadium. It was there that Germany beat Portugal 3-1 in the third-place play-off at the World Cup.
