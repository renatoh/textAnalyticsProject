Such attributes brought the Arsenal striker a hat-trick as Mark Sampson\u2019s England suggested their status as one of the favourites to win Euro 2017 is anything but overblown. Additional goals from Ellen White, the outstanding Jordan Nobbs and Toni Duggan rather cruelly highlighted the disparity between the sides on an evening when England\u2019s strength in midfield left Scotland chasing shadows and Taylor became the first woman to score a hat-trick for the Lionesses in a major finals. She attended the post-match media conference along with Sampson and the match ball. \u201cIt meant a lot,\u201d said Taylor, who has overcome a series of injuries, including a particularly serious knee problem in recent years. \u201cJodie\u2019s world class, simple as that,\u201d Sampson said, \u201cbut the whole team were outstanding, very efficient from back to front. It\u2019s exciting for me to watch this team play, to see how good we can become over, hopefully, the next five matches. \u201cWe\u2019ve found a way to enjoy these pressured occasions. We\u2019ve got to keep working hard and we\u2019ve a difficult game against Spain on Sunday but we\u2019re completely confident we can become the best team in the world.\u201d It must have made chastening viewing for Anna Signeul, Scotland\u2019s manager, down in the technical area and Nicola Sturgeon up in the posh seats. At first Scotland\u2019s first minister would have been cheered when, after only 20 seconds, Jane Ross tried her luck with a 30-yard shot that the England goalkeeper Karen Bardsley looked mighty relived to put over the bar for a corner. If that offered Sturgeon any cause for optimism, it was soon dampened. Almost immediately England\u2019s right-sided combination, Lucy Bronze and Nobbs, began causing Scotland multiple problems. Appropriately, Bronze\u2019s through pass created England\u2019s opener for Taylor. With Scotland holding a dangerously high line, the right-back initially looked to have played in Fran Kirby but, instead, the Chelsea forward \u2013 famously dubbed England\u2019s \u201cmini Messi\u201d by Sampson two years ago \u2013 took out two markers courtesy of a fabulous dummy. It left Taylor clean through and the pacy striker proceeded to shoot England ahead. The Lionesses believe that, since finishing third in the 2015 World Cup in Canada, their fitness levels have risen by 23% courtesy of much intense physical conditioning from Ben Young, who has worked with the England rugby union team. They certainly looked in daunting shape as Scotland could, at times, have been forgiven for wondering if qualifying for their first major tournament had really been such a good idea after all. They fell further behind when another slice of Kirby skill saw her hacked down by Rachel Corsie. Nobbs took the free-kick which Signeul\u2019s defence failed to clear. As the ball ricocheted around the box, Bronze sent a header goalwards that was hacked off the line before Taylor gave another reminder of her predatory instincts by lashing home from six yards. Ifeoma Dieke and Vaila Barsley, Scotland\u2019s normally robust centre-half partnership had been deconstructed well before White claimed the third. It involved Jill Scott shooting from distance, goalkeeper Gemma Fay doing very well to tip the ball on to the bar and the on-rushing White immediately pouncing on the rebound and crisply redirecting it beyond her. Tartan-clad fans attempted to lift their team\u2019s morale with a few choruses of Flower of Scotland while also unfurling a banner in their VIP guest\u2019s honour emblazoned with \u201cHappy Birthday Nicola\u201d. Sturgeon turned 47 on Wednesday and as the interval whistle final blew Dieke and company probably felt double that age. Admittedly the ever industrious Ross menaced sporadically but the lone striker was far too isolated and must have felt increasingly envious of the sort of service Taylor and White enjoyed. Taylor completed her hat-trick thanks to an accomplished lob over Fay which followed Steph Houghton\u2019s free-kick, a clever flick from White and Taylor\u2019s wonderful change of pace which permitted her to peel away from Dieke. England\u2019s midfield amalgam of steel and silk had been a decisive factor, with the excellent Nobbs particularly prominent, so it seemed fitting when she scored the fifth goal. It was a technically audacious one too, the Arsenal midfielder meeting substitute Karen Carney\u2019s cross before volleying sublimely beyond Fay. By the time Barcelona\u2019s Duggan, on for Taylor, added a last-gasp sixth following Nobbs\u2019s corner, Scotland were humiliated. \u201cWe\u2019ve played against a very good side in all areas,\u201d said Signeul, who lost Ross to a potentially tournament ending shoulder injury in the second half. \u201cEngland are a real contender for this tournament but it\u2019s not over for us. We\u2019ll rise again but it was a tough debut.\u201d Spain brush Portugal aside Spain, England\u2019s next opponents in Breda on Sunday, beat Portugal 2-0 in the day\u2019s other game in Group D. The former Arsenal midfielder Vicky Losada scored the opener from Andrea Pereira\u2019s assist and Spain doubled their lead just before half-time from Amanda Sampedro\u2019s header. They continued to dominate after the break, enjoying 76% possession as Portugal failed to get a shot on target. \u201cWe\u2019ll go away now, analyse things and prepare for the next game which is against one of the best sides at this tournament,\u201d said player of the match Sampedro of the England match. Spain\u2019s manager, Jorge Vilda, added: \u201cThe next match we have is against one of the tournament favourites and it will be our most difficult game ever.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
