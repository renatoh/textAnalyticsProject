They're not getting the best out of Ruud van Nistelrooy and it's time Diego Forlan got a chance to partner him. United tend to do better with a link striker and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is not cut out for that. He and Van Nistelrooy are too similar to be an ideal partnership and, with Paul Scholes injured, I feel Forlan should be given at least six starts to prove his worth. Without a man in the hole to link things, United played the ball a bit too long for Van Nistelrooy at Leeds. David Beckham knocked a lot of what I call Hollywood balls, trying to get the Dutchman in behind. They look spectacular if they come off but more often than not don't produce anything. Beckham was hitting the ball early from deep positions and, because the pass was in the air for so long, Lucas Radebe could back off and head it away. When Van Nistelrooy came towards the ball to have it to feet, his marker could stay tight and pressure him. You only need to think of Eric Cantona, Teddy Sheringham and Dwight Yorke to realise the value a link striker has given United. I know Forlan hasn't come up to scratch so far but he hasn't had a decent run at it either. Let's at least see if he's up to it. United are at their best playing fast, one-and two-touch passes over shorter distances which turn defenders and make them move about. With Forlan off the front, Beckham can knock a ball in to him and United have far better attacking options. One possibility is that he can release Van Nistelrooy with a quicker, shorter and more incisive pass. One of the centre-backs might get lured towards Forlan, leaving more space in behind for Van Nistelrooy. Another benefit of the link man is that it allows United's midfield to come up in support. Once Beckham has played the first pass, he can look for a return higher up the park or Forlan might play Ryan Giggs in on the left. United haven't got their usual number of crosses in from wide areas in the last third. Van Nistelrooy thrives on those and I think teams have made a point of trying to push United infield. Let's see if Forlan can get them flowing again."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
