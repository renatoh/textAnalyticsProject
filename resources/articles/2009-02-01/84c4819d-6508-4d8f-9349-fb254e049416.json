Probably not", "bodyText": "A few weeks ago, I joked with a friend: \"I get all my newspapers nowadays from illegal P2P networks\". Well, now the idea has actually come to pass. Swedish daily Sydsvenskan.se released a free, six-page PDF edition as a Bit Torrent through The Pirate Bay. Could the Bay be spared in the Swedish courts by offering a much-needed, legal new outlet for struggling newspapers? Alas, no - this was a one-off experiment, designed to get readers' help subediting Sydsvenskan's upcoming supplement on internet copyright, writer Andreas Ekstr\u00f6m said. And it was designed, of course, to run just ahead of the circus-like trial in which the Bay's founders are defending themselves against music industry copyright charges. You can't help but feel like the editors were making a point. Journalism.co.uk: \"While there are currently no plans to pre-publish content more regularly on TPB, using beta versions to engage readers in the journalistic work process will become more common at both Sydsvenskan and other titles, Ekstrom predicted.\" We won't shed a tear if PDF newspapers don't take off via torrent - in the web age, digital print editions are ghastly. So much that even the Bit Torrent distribution mechanism couldn't impress one dedicated Pirate Bay user, who wrote at the site: \"It is hard to read it in PDF. I'll buy the paper tomorrow!\" Maybe there's a revenue stream here after all\u2026 From paidContent: \u2022 EconMusic Video: MySpace Music's Courtney Holt: Money in ticket sales and data \u2022 Facebook's first in-house app?
