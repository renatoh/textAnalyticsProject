They have 90 minutes in which to establish enough of an advantage to send them to Highbury in two weeks' time with a chance of reaching the semi-finals of the European Cup. Given their recent lack of success against the north London club, they will need every ounce of motivation. And yet, thanks to the internal machinations of their own club, they go into the game against a background of turmoil and instability. It could be said, of course, that turmoil and instability have been the hallmarks of Claudio Ranieri's selection policy, particularly since Roman Abramovich's money gave him the option of three and often four players for every position in the starting XI. But we are talking here of a deliberate attempt to prepare the ground for the coach's departure in the summer, something which can hardly imbue the squad with the degree of collective mental resilience they will surely require this evening. Yesterday's newspapers contained a carefully worded statement in which Peter Kenyon, Chelsea's chief executive, appeared to condemn the weekend's stories about Ranieri's impending departure. \"This wave of unprecedented and continuous media speculation about Claudio's future and false links to other managers is unhelpful to our manager and the players in the build-up to an important match in the Champions League,\" he said. \"We will not add to this speculation by responding and only wish to reiterate that Claudio Ranieri has over three years to run on his contract.\" So no denial, then, except over rumoured links to other managers. Kenyon knows very well that the \"unprecedented and continuous media speculation\" was generated from within Stamford Bridge. His statement is a small masterpiece of disingenuousness. For a man who, seven years ago, was the chief operating officer of Umbro and a non-executive director of Sunderland, Kenyon has done pretty well for himself. After six successful years at Manchester United, last summer he agreed to join Abramovich for about twice the \u00a3750,000 salary he was receiving at Old Trafford, plus a \u00a32m \"golden hello\" in compensation for his lost share options. Kenyon is a smooth fellow who likes to be in shot when the cameras record a major transfer acquisition. After six years in close proximity to Sir Alex Ferguson, he will have a pretty good idea of the extent of the media's power, of how readily some journalists respond to the mere acknowledgment of their existence, and of how that response can be used to transmit a range of messages, sometimes apparently conflicting. Neither he nor his new boss has any bond to Chelsea other than the one formed by their ambition. When Abramovich materialised last summer with a couple of hundred million quid, he was not indulging a whim based on an undying admiration of the deeds of Ted Drake, Peter Osgood or Kerry Dixon. In his eyes, Chelsea FC was not a Grade 1 listed institution. He was simply looking for a football club ripe for promotion to the European elite, which means membership not only of the G14 cabal but of an even more exclusive G3 or G4. And he received a willing response from Chelsea, whose massive debts meant that Ken Bates was only too glad to hear the clatter of petro-roubles. Bates is not a sentimental man, as many former Stamford Bridge heroes can attest. Compared with the Russian oligarch, however, he was an old softie. The sense of pitiless inevitability surrounding the drama of the last months of Ranieri's reign is a foretaste of the way things will be done at the club for as long as Abramovich and Kenyon are on the stage, with the \"super-agent\" Pini Zahavi whispering from the wings. As an Italian who has worked in the Spanish League, Ranieri knows the score. Anyone who looks to a top European club for loyalty, consistency and transparency should be locked up on the grounds of public safety. Ranieri's kind are expendable, their huge salaries the price of their humiliation. If his successor brings cups and championships, the fans will be happy. But for every Real Madrid there are plenty of Internazionales, discarding one perfectly respectable coach after another as they demonstrate that, without some deeper understanding of the game, without patience and without an appreciation of human nature, money and ambition can get you only so far."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
