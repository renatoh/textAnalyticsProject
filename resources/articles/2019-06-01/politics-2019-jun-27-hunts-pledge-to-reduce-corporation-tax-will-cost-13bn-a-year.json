The Institute for Fiscal Studies warned that the Conservative leadership contender\u2019s plans would leave no scope to relax the Tories\u2019 policy of austerity after a decade of cuts to public services, unless other taxes were raised or the public debt was increased. Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, said cutting corporation tax and another promise made by Hunt to raise defence spending would \u201cleave no scope to relieve the pressure on other areas of public spending without tax rises, or a fiscal stance which risked putting debt on a rising path\u201d. Lagging behind his rival, Boris Johnson, in the polls to become prime minister, the foreign secretary has proposed reducing the rate of corporation tax paid by firms to 12.5%, matching the rate in Ireland among the lowest of any major economy. The IFS said that such a step would cost \u00a313bn a year in the short run. While it said there was uncertainty over how much it would cost in the long-run, it disputed the claims of some low-tax advocates that the policy would pay for itself by driving up company investment and encouraging overseas firms to locate in Britain. Sajid Javid, the home secretary, had made such an argument in the Tory leadership race before he was eliminated, saying tax cuts would raise the level of dynamism in the economy and generate greater revenue for the exchequer. \u201cOne thing we can be fairly sure of is that a cut of this magnitude would not pay for itself,\u201d the IFS said. \u201cIt is implausible to believe that profits earned or recorded in the UK could increase by enough to make up for the immediate \u00a313bn fall in revenue.\u201d Among other policy proposals outlined by Hunt in the leadership race include plans to raise defence spending, which the IFS said would come with a hefty price tag and could detract from increased spending on the welfare state. Potentially representing the reversal of a 70-year trend underway since the dawn of the welfare state, Hunt has proposed to raise state spending on defence as a proportion of GDP to 2.5% from the current level of 2%. He had previously suggested the UK needed to double defence spending to 4% over a decade. UK defence spending has gradually fallen from a high of 7% in the 1950s. Britain is one of only seven Nato countries out of 29 members to meet a target to spend 2% of GDP on defence, with most, including Canada and Germany, spending much less. The IFS said raising defence spending to 2.5% of national income over the next five years would cost \u00a315bn a year more in 2023\u221224 than today. Doubling spending over the next decade would cost more than \u00a340bn a year. A spokesman for Hunt said: \u201cAll of Jeremy\u2019s pledges on more defence spending and tax cuts to turbocharge growth will be affordable as we will stick to our fiscal rule to keep debt falling relative to GDP over the cycle. \u201cOur policies will attract even more international investment and ensure that we keep Britain safe and walk tall in the world.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
