Dai Young\u2019s side made the worst possible start when Alex Tait crossed inside the first five minutes. An Andy Goode penalty reduced the arrears before two tries in three minutes turned the game on its head. First, Daly found a gap and to slip in Rob Miller before the centre rounded off a move he had started by taking a return pass from Thomas Young and sliding over. Goode failed with both conversions from tight angles which gave the Falcons at least a lifeline at the break. Within eight minutes of the restart Sinoti set up Josh Furno to score. Goode then found his range to level the score but the former England fly-half\u2019s evening took a turn for the worse when his pass was intercepted by Juan Socino and the fly-half just held off the challenge of Joe Simpson to score. Tom Catterick\u2019s conversion meant Wasps trailed by seven as the game entered the final 15 minutes yet they were denied by another brilliant piece of skill from Daly as his perfect one-handed pass to Guy Thompson and Goode\u2019s conversion ensured the points were shared.
