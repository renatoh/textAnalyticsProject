He wore his traditional outfit, only it was dark blue and white. Arsenal phobia knows no bounds at Tottenham. It set the tone for an afternoon of curiosities. First Teddy Sheringham was sent off for only the second time in his career, then Ipswich won a league game for the first time since August. Only after the final whistle did familiarity regain its grip as yet another referee had to be escorted from the pitch past a baying crowd and then agreed to look at a video of a controversial decision. Sheringham's last red card was 12 years ago and, since his visit to the dentist's chair five years ago, the 35-year-old has managed to rehone his image to that of respected elder statesman and sensible citizen. But Mike Riley took one look at the England striker's flailing attempt to release John McGreal's grip on his shirt and decided he had thrown a punch. A flabbergasted Sheringham, forced to make the embarrassing long walk in front of the watching Sven-Goran Eriksson, protested his innocence and TV replays supported his plea. Riley's second view now becomes extremely important. For on it depends whether one of Spurs' most influential players will miss the FA Cup third-round tie against Coventry, the Worthington Cup semi-final first leg against Chelsea and the Premiership return at Ipswich. Spurs' recent success has been dependent on a core of key players and Sheringham is one of them. Glenn Hoddle rested another, Gus Poyet, on Saturday and paid the price. The South American was being safeguarded for a packed holiday schedule but his ebullience was badly missed. Simon Davies was moved to the Poyet position just behind the strikers on the back of some impressive games out wide. But it was a strange logic and, his goal apart, the youngster struggled. With the in-form Les Ferdinand also restricted to a place on the bench because of a niggling ankle injury, Tottenham were lacking in two crucial areas. The resulting defeat not only exposed the holes in Hoddle's squad but brought the club back to earth after 6-0 and 4-0 victories had prompted swaggering talk of a Champions League place. Here was another reminder that the Hoddle revolution still has some way to go. For Ipswich fans Saturday's evidence was more comforting. Last season's fifth-place Premiership finish flattered the team, but being bottom is an insult. This result proved that the quality remains, even if the points are less plentiful. George Burley's team continue to lack bite up front - Marcus Stewart is still out, possibly until New Year's Day - but the team's commitment and skill levels remain high and the confidence this result gives them will be immense. Ipswich now have every chance of becoming the first Premiership side to be bottom at Christmas and not go down. Their problem this season, turning possession into wins, was more than evident in Saturday's first half. They dominated it, closing their opponents down, clogging up their passing game. But it was Spurs who took the lead with their first meaningful attack. On 12 minutes Sergei Rebrov put his unhappiness at the club behind him to produce a clever run and cross which Davies headed home while his marker McGreal was busy appealing for offside. Ipswich created chances but equalised only just before half-time through Finidi George's overhead kick. From then on the tide turned for Spurs as the Ipswich goalkeeper Matteo Sereni produced a great save to deny Christian Ziege, who also hit the bar. Tottenham played even better after Sheringham's dismissal but, two minutes from time, a quick break stretched their back line, George fired in a cross and the substitute Alun Armstrong dived in to secure an indispensable second win of the season for this lovable club. Even the Ipswich injury news was not so bad for once. McGreal sprained an ankle and will be out for a few weeks but Titus Bramble is fit again to replace him. George is off to the African Nations Championship on January 5 but Stewart should have returned by then. As for Spurs, they are now in the familiar position of having to pick themselves up from a sobering defeat after a promising run - for Ipswich, read Manchester United, Leeds or Charlton. However, Hoddle and his central defender Dean Richards will not share the fixture computer's sense of humour; Tottenham's next game, on Boxing Day, one of the most high-profile days of the year, is at their former club Southampton."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
