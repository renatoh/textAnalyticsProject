Grant lasted eight months, never dispelled the suspicion he landed the job only because of his friendship with Roman Abramovich and subsequently admitted his players had never believed in him. J\u00fcrgen Klopp will hope to leave a more favourable impression at Liverpool or it is quite conceivable, as he admitted with one of those disarming smiles, his next job may be somewhere in Switzerland. Klopp, of course, is more than just a normal bloke, however unpretentious and grounded he seems compared to others inside the football bubble, and his introductory press conference included mentions of his mum, heavy metal, one playful moment where he jabbed a finger at the nearest photographer and asked him to stop clicking, a grinning request to the newspaper journalists to show they were kinder than he had heard and, more than anything, the clear sense that this tall, relaxed guy in his black blazer, Levi jeans and leather boots is a good fit for English football. The first impressions were exactly as you might expect: nobody can be sure whether Klopp will deliver with his aim of \u201cone title\u201d inside four years but it is going to be a lot of fun finding out. \u201cI watch from outside,\u201d Klopp said from a quieter room inside the Centenary Stand, once all the cameras were off and he could pause for a moment. \u201cThey [the fans] seem to be a little bit nervous. The atmosphere in the stadium is good but nobody is really enjoying themselves. It\u2019s never good enough. You are winning and then you hear: \u2018Well, the defence is a problem.\u2019 That is what I mean when I say we have to restart. It is very important that we make it all closer. \u201cWe need to be closer with all the staff, the fans. It is important they don\u2019t think: \u2018These are the good-paid guys, we are the fans.\u2019 \u201cThis is the craziest situation I have ever been in \u2013 all the photographs, this big trouble [the press conference]. This is not what I want. I want to work with the team. But this is part of the deal. So we do this today, then let\u2019s start to work with the team. I am not the guy who is going to go out and shout: \u2018We are going to conquer the world!\u2019 or something like this. But we will conquer the ball, yeah, each fucking time! We will chase the ball, we will run more, fight more [jabs finger on table]. \u201cWe will work better together. We will have better organisation in defence than the other teams. We have to find our own way to play. Our performances have to be enjoyable for ourselves. I don\u2019t want to tackle too rough but if there is a tackle that is legal, a good tackle that gets the ball, it\u2019s like a goal, if you want? Yeeaaah! [punches air] The players have to get the feeling that, I don\u2019t know, they can dive into the game. What I want is to be a real special team.\u201d These are the kind of statements that will endear the German \u2013 \u201ca normal guy from the Black Forest,\u201d he said, \u201cI am the Normal One\u201d \u2013 to his new fan-base in a city where the Liverpool Echo\u2019s splash was \u201cKlopp Mania\u201d and the back page had his surname superimposed over the sign for the Kop. His message for the supporters was to \u201cstop being doubters and become believers\u201d. He seemed bemused by any suggestion there would be a potential issue with Liverpool\u2019s transfer committee, explaining that he had \u201cthe first and the last word\u201d and that it had not troubled him for even 10 seconds, and there was certainly no need for him to apologise for his English. Klopp spoke with great clarity, cliche-free apart from one reference to the club\u2019s \u201cfootball family\u201d, and everything he said was backed up by the kind of full-beam smile that Brendan Rodgers had spent a lot of money on trying to replicate. With Rodgers it felt like a media-trained act at times; with Klopp, there was just the sense he was entirely comfortable in his own skin. Klopp wanted us to know he was a \u201cfootball romantic\u201d, someone who \u201cloves the stories and the history\u201d and who was photographed touching the \u201cThis is Anfield\u201d sign when he visited the stadium as manager of Borussia Dortmund. Yet he also made the point that a club\u2019s history can eventually become like lugging around a backpack, and in Liverpool\u2019s case one that sometimes feels like it weighs 20 kilos. His new club have gone a quarter of a century since their last league championship. \u201cA long time,\u201d Klopp reflected. \u201cI want to see the first step next week, not always compare with other times.\u201d Later, he spoke to a smaller group of football writers in Room 7, named after Kenny Dalglish and the other wearers of Liverpool\u2019s most famous number, in a stand lined with pictures of Bill Shankly, Bob Paisley et al. Klopp had already been asked by that stage if he wanted to join the cast of legends at Anfield. \u201cI don\u2019t compare myself with these genius managers from the past,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt is cool you are looking forward to working with me but none of these great managers said in his first press conference: \u2018My target is I want to be a legend.\u2019\u201d He was completely right: legendary status is attained through trophies not talking. Yet Klopp, one imagines, has already seduced Liverpool\u2019s supporters. His last line at Dortmund, he explained, was \u201cit\u2019s not so important what they think when you come in, it\u2019s much more important what people think when you leave\u201d. Yet first impressions are important, too, and Klopp Mania may be here to stay."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
