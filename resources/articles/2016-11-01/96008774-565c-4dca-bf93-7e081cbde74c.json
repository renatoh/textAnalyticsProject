Spencer hosted a widely criticized event in Washington DC earlier this month. At the event attendees gave Hitler salutes while Spencer himself quoted Nazi propaganda and shouted \u201cHail Trump\u201d. Spencer was invited to appear at Texas A&amp;M by Preston Wiginton, a former student. Wiginton met with university officials on Monday, in a meeting protesters had hoped might lead to the cancellation of Spencer\u2019s appearance. Almost 10,000 people had signed a petition urging Texas A&amp;M to cancel the 6 December event and denounce Spencer\u2019s \u201cneo-Nazi, white nationalist rhetoric\u201d. Amy Smith, a spokeswoman for Texas A&amp;M, told the Guardian the event would be held as planned, however. Smith said the university had not invited Spencer, but would not cancel the event for reasons of free speech. Texas A&amp;M plans to hold its own event at the same time \u201ccelebrating the inclusive environment and core values that we hold dear\u201d, Smith said. Wiginton, who described himself as \u201csympathetic to nationalists\u201d, told the Guardian he had invited Spencer before the Washington DC event \u2013 which highlighted the racism and sexism of some in the \u201calt-right\u201d movement \u2013 but had not considered withdrawing the invitation. He said he had invited Spencer \u201cprimarily because he\u2019s been in the news quite a bit with the Trump election\u201d. \u201cAt American universities the education is so left-leaning that it\u2019s more of an indoctrination than a discussion of ideas,\u201d Wiginton said. \u201cI\u2019ve brought other controversial speakers to A&amp;M on topics that people don\u2019t want to discuss. Things such as immigration. So I just thought it was an opportunity.\u201d The Southern Poverty Law Center has described Spencer as \u201ca suit-and-tie version of the white supremacists of old, a kind of professional racist in khakis\u201d. He is the president of the National Policy Institute, a white nationalist thinktank, and has proposed a 50-year ban on immigration to the US, to preserve a white-dominant America. More than 9,800 people signed a petition calling on Texas A&amp;M to cancel the Spencer event. Smith, the university\u2019s senior vice-president and chief marketing and communications officer, described Spencer\u2019s views as \u201creprehensible\u201d but said the event would go ahead. \u201cOur students and our faculty, our staff and our alumni are outraged that this is happening to our campus when no one from our campus desires it,\u201d Smith said. Smith said Wiginton had booked the event space before Texas A&amp;M had realised he would use it to host Spencer. When the university discovered Wiginton planned to host a white nationalist event they were unable to cancel it due to free speech laws. Smith said Texas A&amp;M planned to review its booking policies. Texas A&amp;M will hold an alternative event at the same time as Wiginton\u2019s event, Smith said, which will be a \u201ccelebration\u201d of the university\u2019s \u201ccore values and diversity\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ll have people address the crowd and it\u2019ll be more of an inclusive event focus [rather] than giving credence to some person and their rhetoric that we find reprehensible,\u201d she said. Wiginton, who attended Texas A&amp;M in 2006-07, said he had invited Spencer as a private citizen. He said he had not yet decided whether the event would be exclusively for university students or would allow members of the public. Spencer is due to speak at Rudder Tower on the university campus. Wiginton said he did not know how many people would attend, but the space would hold 400 people. Wiginton said that he had previously hosted an event with Jared Taylor \u2013 a white nationalist who also appeared at the \u201calt-right\u201d event in Washington DC \u2013 at Texas A&amp;M in October 2012. On that occasion 11 people came to see Taylor speak, Wiginton said, after college lecturers asked students not to attend."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
