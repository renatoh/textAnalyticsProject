Emotion flew out of me'", "bodyText": "I have been playing a song about life and death on a loop today. While waiting to interview Will Miller, the former Spurs and Burton Albion footballer who wrote and sang the song just days after the death of Ugo Ehiogu, his former coach who died in April 2017 aged 44, the ghostly video of Crash Landing has been spooling out of my laptop. On a muted, sun-kissed afternoon, it offers a melancholic and beautiful soundtrack for these unsettling times. For Miller, Ehiogu\u2019s death felt like \u201ca crash landing on the moon\u201d. Three years on, trying to adjust to our new isolated reality with illness and death all around us, life continues in an eerie way. \u201cIt\u2019s weird,\u201d Miller says. \u201cBut sometimes you have to switch course. I remember being absolutely certain I was going to play first-team football for Tottenham. When I realised it wouldn\u2019t happen, it was like killing an idea of myself. The person I thought I was going to be was dead. I needed to reinvent myself. I found it really difficult and it reminds me of the challenges we\u2019re all facing right now.\u201d From sadness and uncertainty, the 23-year-old engenders optimism and hope as he stresses how art thrives in adversity. \u201cDespite the pain and confusion, storytelling will always play a big part in our lives. In my own experience so many beautiful emotions have come out of difficult times. This time could be a chance for people to do something different. Something better.\u201d Miller\u2019s dream of becoming a star for Spurs, the club he had supported since he was a boy and for whom he played in their academy and development teams for six years, was replaced by Championship football for Burton. \u201cIt felt brutal at 21,\u201d he says. \u201cFootball is so cut-throat. You dedicate everything to that one craft and then someone goes: \u2018We\u2019re not having you.\u2019 At Tottenham I worked it out before they told me. I had an amazing relationship with the club but it wasn\u2019t working.\u201d He did well in the Championship but a bad injury changed everything. Miller fought his way back into Burton\u2019s first team but a year ago this month he decided he no longer wanted to be a professional footballer. He buried that identity in order to become a film-maker and musician. Miller captures the joy of football as well as the fascination of playing pre-season first-team games for Spurs under Mauricio Pochettino but his happiness in his new world is more vivid. It is a reminder that, from the remnants of a past life, something deeper can flourish. These ideas are rooted in Crash Landing. \u201cUgo was an amazing man,\u201d Miller says of the former England footballer who was his under-23 manager at Tottenham. \u201cWe worked with him day in and day out. He was super-concentrated and so gifted. Because he was an ex-player, and because of his personality, he was one of us.\u201d Miller pauses as he recalls Ehiogu\u2019s death from a heart attack. \u201cUgo was the first person I had ever been close to who passed away. I was thinking: \u2018Oh, my God, life\u2019s so fragile.\u2019 I was on loan at Burton and I tried to carry on as normal and train but there was too much shock. Two days later my brother Gil and I recorded the song. He had played me this incredible piece of music he had written. Then Ugo passed and I went home. Gil played it again. I said: \u2018Let\u2019s turn this into a song.\u2019 Raw emotion flew out of me and the lyrics were written in 20 minutes. I put it down in one take and fluffed up some of the words. But I wanted to leave it like that. \u201cIt\u2019s me singing on a crappy mic in my dad\u2019s loft and we recorded it in 45 minutes. I\u2019d spent two years working every day with Ugo so it was about how difficult it is to comprehend death. I was thinking of him when singing but I didn\u2019t want to make it ridiculously sad. I wanted us to feel how amazing some people are before they pass away.\u201d For a long time Miller did nothing with the song. He was still playing football and he did not feel ready to share it. Last month, with no announcement, Crash Landing appeared on platforms such as Spotify under the name of Myacka, which Will and Gil Miller use. \u201cThe reaction from the few people who have heard it was amazing. I\u2019m not craving anything further. The fact it\u2019s affected them is enough for me. But last June we shot the video and it was an amazing experience again as 45 people, family and friends, were in it.\u201d As a little boy Miller won a BBC nationwide audition for the role of Oliver Twist \u2013 and acted alongside Tom Hardy and Sophie Okonedo. But football meant more to him. When he was 14, and with Leyton Orient, he was offered a year\u2019s trial at Tottenham. In July 2016, having just turned 20, Miller was selected for Spurs\u2019 pre-season tour of Australia. He played in the first team and Pochettino was impressed. \u201cI\u2019m very happy with Will,\u201d he said. \u201cHe can be a very good footballer. He has a fantastic character.\u201d There is a photograph of Pochettino embracing him after the Juventus game and Miller says: \u201cHe was an incredible, family-type of guy who created an amazing team. He was so clever and we played for each other and for him so much. On that tour I did well out of position as a left wing-back against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Juve.\u201d How did he feel playing alongside Harry Kane and Christian Eriksen? \u201cThere wasn\u2019t much ego in that team. They were all helpful and nice \u2013 and amazing at what they did. I know Pochettino liked me as a human being but I don\u2019t know how close I was to hitting the level needed. The crunch came the following pre-season when I went on tour with the Tottenham squad to America. I was training as an attacker, more my position, but didn\u2019t play. I was devastated.\u201d Miller accepted a permanent transfer to Burton. \u201cI was playing well in the Championship and proving myself. Then my knee went against QPR [when he dislocated it badly in January 2018], and I was like, \u2018Fuck!\u2019 I had a second operation, because I couldn\u2019t bend my leg, and it was incredibly painful.\u201d Over the next nine months, Miller was sustained by his friendship with his Burton team-mate Marvin Sordell who struggled with depression. Sordell, a former Premier League footballer, was also creative. \u201cMarvin was writing all these poems and I said: \u2018They\u2019re really great but you should make visuals for them because it will connect with our generation even more.\u2019\u201d Miller encouraged Sordell to set one of his poems, Denis Prose, an anagram for depression, to music and with a couple of other friends they made a short film about that difficult subject. \u201cI turned all my time to the creative side because I couldn\u2019t play football,\u201d Miller says. \u201cI was lucky I had Marvin and other friends who also wanted to create. By November 2018 I was playing again in the first team. But, by the end of the season, I decided to retire. My mentality had changed. I was so invested in this creative stuff it diluted some of that drive as a footballer.\u201d Miller didn\u2019t adjust well to retirement. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to pursue something for that long, to have an absolute dream, and then to give it up. That routine of training every day, and playing on a Saturday or Sunday, is gone now. I was also dealing with changing identity. When anyone saw me they\u2019d ask: \u2018How is football?\u2019 Not even how are you? Being a footballer is an all\u2011consuming identity. \u201cI went through a transition and for six months I didn\u2019t talk about it. We all carry emotions and they weigh on us, and it affected my mental health in a bad way. It made me angry. And I\u2019m not an angry person. I\u2019m very calm. I thought: \u2018This isn\u2019t me.\u2019\u201d Did he talk to a psychologist? \u201cYeah. One session changed everything. I wasn\u2019t depressed but I definitely underestimated how much it affected me. I\u2019m still going through it but I feel much clearer.\u201d Miller had been earning good money as a Championship footballer and, as he says: \u201cIt\u2019s a massive risk because I\u2019m starting from the bottom again and if I didn\u2019t feel this passion for creativity I definitely would still pursue football. As hard as it is, it\u2019s absolutely amazing and gives you feelings you can\u2019t get anywhere else. When I scored my first professional goal away against Wolves in the last minute \u2026\u201d The pleasure that comes from creativity is more nuanced and tangled but Miller\u2019s excitement is plain as he talks about 180 Productions, the company he and Sordell have set up with Harry Campbell, who was also at Burton with them, and their friend Maxwell Harris-Tharp, a film-maker. \u201cWe\u2019re in the process of making a short film with the England team for the Heads Up campaign. It\u2019s Prince William\u2019s charitable campaign and it\u2019s about mental health and football. Marvin, Max and Harry produced it and I\u2019m directing it. It\u2019s exciting to have that opportunity at such an early stage in our company\u2019s life. Marvin\u2019s been involved with Heads Up and he leads the way in helping footballers talk about their mental health.\u201d Did he recognise Sordell\u2019s battle with depression soon after they became friends? \u201cNo. Depression is not always visible but when I read his poems they were amazing. They were brave. They were real and honest. It takes a lot of guts to open up like Marvin did and I felt privileged to work with him on the film about Denis Prose. That\u2019s where our company started. Now we have ambitions to tell stories which can hopefully touch people in a good way whether in music, film or writing.\u201d Miller has just directed his first short film. \u201cThe theme is about how we all carry emotions, damaged relationships, shattered dreams. We carry terrible things far too long. It\u2019s partly based on those six months when I was lost \u2013 but it has nothing to do with football.\u201d Now that Crash Landing, his moving lament for Ehiogu, can finally be heard, has he sent it to Pochettino? \u201cNo. But if he\u2019s still got the same number I might send it. I think he\u2019s got time on his hands at the moment.\u201d We have all been forced to stop and pause, and, as Miller says: \u201cit scares you a little but it also makes you think and that\u2019s when better work comes out. Beyond all the uncertainty and worry it\u2019s a time for reflection and appreciation of each other. Hopefully, out of these dark days, something special can still emerge.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
