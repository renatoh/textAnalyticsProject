I've been a caller at Gala Bingo in Bognor Regis for five years now. This year I won the Southern Caller of the Year award, so now I'm in training for the national finals which take place on November 27 in Catford. Apart from my technique, I'll be judged on my bingo knowledge and a stage presentation. I think I'll crack some jokes. I tried singing last time but it wasn't that successful. Where would you rather be? Part of the winner's prize is a trip to Las Vegas, so I'm banking on that. What's so special about it? It has to be one of the most fun and surreal cities in the world. The nightlife is amazing, the shows are totally over the top and it's a place where dreams get made and broken. What would you do there? The Americans play a very different style of bingo, so I'd like to introduce them to the British way which is a lot quicker. I'd love to catch a show like the one that Siegfried and Roy used to do. It would have been interesting to be in the audience when one of the Bengal tigers tried to snack on Roy. Winning a million on the roulette would also be quite nice. Where would you stay? The Luxor hotel (luxor.com). It has 4,476 rooms, a full-size pyramid, a shopping centre and a casino. There's even a wedding chapel. You could go to Vegas and never leave the hotel. Who would you take with you? My girlfriend. Or Kelly Brook if she was up for a flutter. What's the one place you'd like to see before you die? The wreck of the Titanic because it's something that very few people have seen. There's a specialist tour operator called Wild Wings (wildwings.co.uk) which takes you 4,000 metres down in the same deep-diving support vessel that they used for James Cameron's movie. I'd love to see the bridge and the famous grand staircase. It's a whole other world down there."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
