A game that had felt at times like the afternoon session of a Test match sprang dramatically to life under the Oval floodlights, as the Tigers\u2019 uncanny ability to build pressure in the field and throw experienced teams off their game pushed a nervy New Zealand all the way. The scorecard records that the Black Caps made it with almost three overs to spare, but the sweat stains will tell a different story. So will the Bangladesh fans, who once again turned out to claim this patch of south London turf as their own. Ross Taylor, whose shepherding 82 did the most to see his side safely home, said later he could imagine himself in Chittagong. If any of the data analysts at this World Cup is calculating decibels-per-run, this crowd must surely be topping the table, ready to clap their inflatable sticks for anything from a failed DRS review to a mid-innings drinks break. They will not forget how close this game felt. Chasing an under-par 244, no batsman managed to impose himself on Mashrafe Mortaza\u2019s bowling attack, a giddy run-out and a series of near-misses constantly derailing their efforts. At 160 for two, the off-spinner Mehidy Hasan struck twice in an over to remove the dangerous New Zealand captain Kane Williamson and Tom Latham for a four-ball duck. Taylor himself survived a run-out chance on 70, only to tickle one to the keeper 12 runs later, leaving his team feeling awkwardly far from their target at 191 for five. Run rate was irrelevant to both sides \u2013 only wickets mattered. Needing 44 from the final 10 overs, Colin de Grandhomme went for a cheeky tip-shot over the keeper\u2019s head. Mushfiqur Rahim \u2013 a man no taller than Eva Longoria \u2013 reached an arm into the air. And it just kept going, telescoping like Inspector Gadget, until it plucked the ball from the space above him. James Neesham holed out next over. Bangladesh were still in this. Both teams had stuck with the line-ups that had brought victory in their opening matches and Bangladesh\u2019s batting performance began like a copy of their South Africa game. The openers Tamim Iqbal and Soumya Sarkar teed off and got out, bringing Sunday\u2019s match-winning pair Shakib Al Hasan and Mushfiqur Rahim together again. They had added 50 in 54 balls when a mix-up left Mushfiqur stranded; from there, the innings stalled, save some game hitting from Mohammad Saifuddin in the final overs. Unlike New Zealand \u2013 the kind of team you would be happy to meet your parents \u2013 the current Bangladesh team have a rather rebellious past. And the all-rounder Shakib was once at the centre of it \u2013 five years ago, he was handed a playing ban by his own cricket board for what it termed a \u201csevere attitude problem\u201d. He must have mended his ways. Currently the world\u2019s top-ranked all-rounder in ODIs, he top-scored here with a sparkling 64 but it was his talismanic left-arm spin that threatened to unravel New Zealand. Having taken a wicket with his very first delivery \u2013 Martin Guptill, who had taken 264 runs off his team in their three-ODI series earlier this year \u2013 he got Colin Munro out to a ground-skimming catch at midwicket. Then, with New Zealand 61 for two, and Shakib in his fourth over, Taylor and Williamson seemed to lose their nerve entirely. After a muddled call, Williamson, a foot out of his crease, survived only because the keeper had broken the wicket, knocking the bails with an elbow. Two balls later, Taylor drove down the pitch, Shakib got a hand to the ball and Williamson was almost run out a second time. An inside edge past Taylor\u2019s stumps completed the over. For a team that has a reputation as \u201cclinical\u201d, it was all a bit Doogie Howser MD. In the end, Bangladesh did not have enough runs to defend. \u201cThe big mistake was done in the batting \u2013 get set and get out,\u201d said Mortaza. \u201cIf we could have managed to score 20 or 30 more runs it would have been different.\u201d Safiuddin\u2019s castling of Matt Henry with seven runs remaining may have pumped up the crowd, but it could not pump the brakes. \u201cWe had a bit of luck today,\u201d admitted Taylor. \u201cWe\u2019d have loved to have won the game a lot earlier than that but you\u2019ve got to give credit to the Bangladesh team. They just never gave up.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
