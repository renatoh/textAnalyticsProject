That would have been lovely, but Charlotte \u2013 sitting demurely in the front row \u2013 would have to wait. Lord Justice Leveson had other things on his mind. \"It is not the way I would have chosen to spend my Sunday evening,\" he said crossly, referring to the weekend leak on Guido Fawkes' website of Alastair Campbell's witness statement, three days before he was due to deliver it in person. Leveson, who is presiding over the inquiry with that uniquely judicial blend of steeliness and benevolence, was withering about the incendiary blogger. Gielgud could not have bettered the scorn with which he referred to \"the gentleman on whose website this appeared\". Guido, aka Paul Staines, has been summoned before the court on Thursday to explain himself. He will presumably refuse to disclose his source and has so far rejected all demands to take down the leaked document. \"I will pay the very closest attention to the way he responds to my order,\" said Leveson menacingly. The hanging, drawing and quartering equipment is being brought up from the vaults. The secret of the inquiry's appeal is variety. All human life is here, as one former newspaper used to say. Before Ms Church and a celeb of an earlier vintage, Anne Diamond, we had Christopher Jefferies, the former teacher arraigned by the press for the murder of Jo Yeates on the basis that he had blue hair and liked poetry, and Ian Hurst, a former military intelligence officer whose computer was allegedly hacked. by private investigators. The tale of what Jefferies' solicitor has called his client's \"monstering\" is a particularly lamentable one, but the full horror failed to come across. Inquiry counsel Robert Jay's dull monotone didn't help, and poor Jay also had to admit he had never read the poetry of Christina Rossetti, which the tabloids' Pre-Raphaelite correspondents had used against the long-time English teacher to suggest an unhealthy preoccupation with death. The papers were very exercised by the fact that Jefferies was \"posh\" and \"loved culture and poetry\". \"If you love culture and poetry, does that make you posh?\" asked Leveson. Mr Jay, who evidently spends too much time reading legal briefs and too little reading Victorian verse, left the question hanging. The main charge against the inquiry is that it is being \"distorted by celebrities\". Well, the critics should have been there for the afternoon session, because the two celebs on show were powerful, articulate, intelligent witnesses. Diamond explained how \"literally grubby\" reporters rooted through her rubbish. One reporter dressed as a doctor to get close to the delivery room where she was about to give birth to her first child. As soon as the baby was born, she felt obliged to flee with it in the back of a laundry van. Worst of all, when her son Sebastian died, her home was besieged by reporters, one of whom rushed into the house with a bunch of flowers pretending to be a well-wisher. Church talked about the \"psychological grind\" she had endured since she found fame at the age of 12, detailing a catalogue of invented or embroidered stories, more grubby reporters in her shrubbery and the traditional tabloid journey from devotion to denigration. They had built her up, so they felt they had the right to knock her down. From the \"voice of an angel\" to the \"vice of an angel\". When she was approaching her 16th birthday, the Sun had a daily clock counting down the days until she could have legal sex. Tasteful. It was not a happy afternoon for Rupert Murdoch. Diamond alleged that she started to be attacked in the press after asking the great mogul how he could sleep at night when his papers pursued Princess Diana and Elton John so relentlessly. She reckoned she was being targeted for having the courage to take Murdoch on. Church said that as a 13-year-old she had been flown to New York to sing at Rupert Murdoch's wedding to Wendi Deng. She alleged she was offered the choice between a \u00a3100,000 fee or favourable treatment in the Murdoch press. Her management suggested taking the latter. News International deny such an offer was made, and it is one of the weaknesses of the inquiry that there is so little cross-examination. It would be useful to hear both sides on specific allegations. Church also said Murdoch asked her to sing the Pie Jesu without realising it was part of the requiem mass and hardly appropriate for a wedding. Had she sung it after giving her evidence, however, it would have been perfect. Whatever Leveson concludes \u2013 and he told Diamond it was not a simple \"binary decision\" between statutory government regulation and self-regulation \u2013 this inquiry will mark the end of a callous, stop-at-nothing way of doing journalistic business. Readers just won't stand for it any longer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
