The letter, coordinated by the celebrity chef and healthy eating campaigner Jamie Oliver, also calls for action that would make healthier foods cheaper and easier to recognise, adding that the NHS is struggling to cope with the burgeoning obesity crisis. \u201cWe don\u2019t agree on everything, but we do agree on this: If we don\u2019t act now, the current generation of young children could well live shorter lives than their parents,\u201d the letter to Theresa May says. It was signed by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, as well as the heads of the Scottish National party and the Liberal Democrats, Nicola Sturgeon and Vince Cable, and the joint leaders of the Green party, Caroline Lucas and Jonathan Bartley. \u201cWe are writing to urge you to take bold action to tackle one of the greatest health challenges of our time. A crisis which is putting immense pressure on the NHS as it approaches its 70th birthday,\u201d they write. Saying a raft of measures needed to be introduced en masse to tackle the problem, they say they would support the prime minister if she banned multi-buy offers on junk food, stopped adverts for it before 9pm and online, and prohibited the use of popular cartoon characters and celebrities in ads. Among other proposals, they call for the tax system to be \u201cused to make healthy food cheaper and discourage unhealthy choices both at home and on our high streets\u201d. The leaders also say the levels of sugar, calories, salt and fat in junk food should be lowered overall, while more training should be given to medical staff to help people with nutrition. A government source told the Times many of the opposition proposals were already in the pipeline as part of its anti-obesity drive."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
