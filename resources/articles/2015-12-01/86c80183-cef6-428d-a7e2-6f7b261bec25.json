Lord Coe will be questioned by MPs from the culture, media and sport select committee over the investigation into blood doping in the sport following revelations made in the Sunday Times in August. \u201cThere needs to be more humility from the IAAF and he needs to recognise that there have clearly been problems with the way doping issues have been dealt with in the past,\u201d the committee member Damian Collins told The Times. \u201cI thought the way the IAAF rubbished the Sunday Times investigation was totally inappropriate. Their response has been incredibly aggressive.\u201d Collins added that he hoped athletics would now follow cycling\u2019s lead and set up an independent body to manage doping. Coe will be asked about the world governing body\u2019s response to doping allegations, including the former Olympic 1,500m champion\u2019s remark in August that investigations into suspicious blood results amounted to \u201ca declaration of war on our sport\u201d. He has since insisted he was only referring to stories which had tainted the reputation of clean athletes. Coe can also expect questions on his association with Nike and Collins acknowledged that he had \u201cdone the right thing\u201d in ending his 37-year association with the American sportswear company. However, the MP for Folkestone &amp; Hythe admitted that Coe will face questions over the controversial decision to award the 2021 world championships to Eugene. \u201cThere are serious questions about the general process by which Eugene was awarded the world championships,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a very unusual process. Why did it take place?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
