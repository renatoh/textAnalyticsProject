The Arsenal manager criticised Giroud for the show of dissent that led to him being booked in the 24th minute but he argued strongly that the second yellow card his striker was shown for a clumsy lunge on Ivo Pinto was unfair. Wenger felt his team had been unlucky to lose 2-1 and he claimed Dinamo\u2019s opening goal ought to have been ruled out for offside. He also expressed confidence Arsenal would still qualify for the knockout phase for the 16th season in succession. \u201cWe were a bit unlucky,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cWe had a lot of the ball and, as well, we had early chances. I believe the first goal is offside and after that, the sending-off is very harsh. \u201cWe were not at our best but nor was the referee. Dinamo stopped us [unfairly] in situations without being punished \u2013 counter-attacks where we had to play 10 against 11 in one half, very strong situations. \u201cYes, he [the referee] was rash [with the second yellow card]. The first yellow is Giroud\u2019s fault because he protested \u2013 even if it was not a foul against him. He should not have responded to the referee. But the second, he is unlucky to touch the guy. I don\u2019t understand the referee. \u201cI don\u2019t think on the second yellow, Giroud saw him [Pinto]. It was accidental completely. But it happened. I thought at that moment it was not a second yellow. It has to be on purpose, a foul on purpose. He should have given many yellows tonight.\u201d Wenger made six changes to the team that had beaten Stoke City 2-0 on Saturday and the quality of his reinforcements were called into question. He was asked whether, with the benefit of hindsight, the decision to rotate so heavily had been wise. Arsenal have a Premier League derby at Chelsea on Saturday lunchtime. \u201cLook, when you don\u2019t win the game you have to look at yourself and think you haven\u2019t got it right,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe the players who came in had bad games but it didn\u2019t work. I believe that we were a bit unlucky and that we lacked cohesion in some situations. I have to analyse that well. It\u2019s very difficult to give a definite answer straight after the game.\u201d Arsenal lost their opening match of the Premier League season \u2013 at home to West Ham United \u2013 and they have now lost their opening European tie. \u201cMathematically, we can qualify without any problem \u2013 if we produce the performances we want at home,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cWe can put things right in the next five games. Tonight it was a special circumstance \u2013 [we had] a lot of the ball, Zagreb gave everything and once we were 2-0 down, it was very difficult with 10 against 11. Let\u2019s see where we stand after six games. Then we can draw conclusions.\u201d The Dinamo manager, Zoran Mamic, described his team\u2019s performance as tactically perfect. He added: \u201cWe tried to close the middle and stop their fast passes. It is nothing new. Other teams who have beaten Arsenal play like this. \u201cThis is a good way to beat them. We were just concentrated on not letting their quality players come to the ball.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
