The store had 14 products in the top five for each category in the annual exercise by Good Housekeeping magazine, although budget chain Aldi had the best Christmas pudding and tastiest vegetarian meal \u2013 its \u00a31.99 spinach, leek and cheddar cheese parcels. This year, for the first time, vegetarian main courses and stuffings were added to the \u201cbasket\u201d of the usual Christmas staples: a 16-strong list including champagne and sparkling wine, mince pies, frozen turkey, smoked salmon, Christmas pudding and brandy butter \u2013 which were blind-tasted (all packaging removed) by a panel of experts. This reflected the rise of vegetarianism and \u201cflexitarianism\u201d in the UK, Good Housekeeping said, with festive diners expecting supermarkets to offer much more than a token nut roast for their Christmas dinner. The best Christmas pudding was Aldi\u2019s Specially Selected Golden Topped Christmas Pudding (\u00a37.99), while the tastiest mince pies were Tesco Finest six mince pies (\u00a32). Iceland\u2019s pigs in blankets (10 for \u00a33) came top of their class. Taking the overall turkey crown this year was Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s British Oakham turkey crown with pork, sage and onion stuffing (\u00a327). Shoppers were also advised to head to M&amp;S for its winning prosecco (\u00a310) or to Sainsbury\u2019s, where its Taste the Difference NV Champagne Brut (\u00a318) \u2013 which goes on sale in November \u2013 scored top marks. \u201cSupermarkets understand that consumers tend to trade up over Christmas and many have focused on their premium ranges,\u201d said Angela Trofymova, food testing manager at Good Housekeeping. \u201cM&amp;S has proved that shelling out a little more where possible can take your festive dining experience to the next level, while budget supermarket Aldi shows you can get cost-effective quality without breaking the bank.\u201d In its quest to find the best, the Good Housekeeping taste test team and consumer panel ate and drank their way through 316 different festive foods in 16 different categories from more than 30 retailers. Positive recommendations in influential national taste tests can clear supermarket shelves. Last year, own-brand \u201cluxury\u201d mince pies from frozen food giant Iceland sold out in many parts of the UK after being judged the best, beating 24 other brands including Harrods and Selfridges. And Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s Belgian Chocolate and Orange Star Christmas Pudding \u2013 last year crowned the best of the Christmas pudding bunch \u2013 was a strong seller that other retailers sought to emulate. Aldi\u2019s award-winning Veuve Monsigny Champagne Brut NV \u2013 at \u00a310.99 \u2013 was again highly rated this year.
