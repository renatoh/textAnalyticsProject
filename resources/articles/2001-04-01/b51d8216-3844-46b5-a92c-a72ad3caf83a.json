This afternoon the Newcastle manager makes his first competitive visit to his former club since leaving to manage England in 1982. Last night he met with Sean Hedges-Quinn, the sculptor whose statue of Sir Alf Ramsey was unveiled at Portman Road last year, to discuss a permanent reminder of his 13-year managerial tenure in East Anglia. Ipswich are to have their idol back. \"We put Ipswich on the map because of the football, not the tractors,\" says the former Barcelona and Porto coach, who won the FA and Uefa Cups with the Suffolk side. \"I turned a Cinderella club into a team that was well respected throughout Europe. \"The biggest regret of my life was not winning the championship. If I could have bought two more players in 1981 we would have done it. We played 66 games and used only 21 players - they got us to the semi-finals of the FA Cup, the sixth round of the League Cup and won the Uefa Cup, but Aston Villa pipped us for the league on the last day of the season.\" Prior to taking the England job, Robson had been courted by other clubs hoping he might reproduce his Ipswich magic on a bigger stage. \"The night we won the Uefa Cup I got a call from Martin Edwards asking me to take over at Manchester United,\" he recalls. \"I told him he'd given me a headache and I wished he'd never called. It crossed my mind that I'd passed up a chance of a lifetime, but you can never tell what's around the corner.\" On that subject, even he did not anticipate Ipswich's startling progress this season. Supposed lambs to the slaughter, they are on the verge of the Champions League and it has all been masterminded by a man signed by Robson. \"I staged a private trial match in Ayrshire,\" he says. \"When we arrived there were 300 people in the ground, including managers and scouts from other clubs. George Burley played and I told them to take him off after 20 minutes. He was devastated, but I didn't want all those other buggers to see him.\" Burley made his debut as a 17-year-old at Old Trafford, charged with marking George Best. Backed up by the stability of a club that has employed 10 managers since turning professional in 1936, he has approached Premiership management with an equally unfazed assurance. \"George has found what I found, that it's a great club to work for,\" says Robson. \"The manager's name is never written on the door in white chalk with a sponge hanging below. They always had a Corinthian attitude.\" How the native north-easterner must crave similar success at Newcastle, where his Tyneside revolution has temporarily stalled. \"It'll take two years to clean this club up,\" he adds. \"But I'm still enthusiastic and motivated. I just wish I was going back to Ipswich with my strongest team. It will be an emotional day.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
