Martin O'Neill, the Villa manager, had described Wrexham's Racecourse Ground as a \"graveyard\" ahead of the game, referring to the numerous top-flight clubs that had seen their cup hopes extinguished by the Welsh club in recent seasons. Having twice won this competition as Leicester City manager, however, O'Neill was hardly going to hand the League Two club the advantage of fielding a weakened team and the Premier League club's quality was obvious early, with Shaun Maloney in particular proving far too good for the full-back Simon Spender. Maloney has struggled to settle in the Midlands since his January arrival from Celtic and a return north of the border before Friday's transfer deadline remains possible. However, the 24-year-old had put his homesickness out of his mind as he tormented Spender down the left flank, twice going close to scoring before finally doing so on 29 minutes. Receiving the ball from Gareth Barry 35 yards out, the midfielder cut in from the left, escaped Spender and waltzed past two more defenders before guiding a right-foot strike into the far corner of the net from the edge of the penalty area. With a one-goal lead, Villa could not expect to cruise through to the final whistle and Wrexham attempted to level the scores in a breathless opening to the second half. Villa quickly regained their composure, however, and Luke Moore made the game safe with a glancing header from Barry's free-kick on 53 minutes. With the game up, Wrexham defending became ever more lax and Nigel Reo-Coker dispossessed Shaun Pejic to score Villa's third nine minutes later. Maloney, Villa's outstanding performer, then claimed a second goal when he beat the helpless goalkeeper Michael Proctor with a stunning 30-yard effort on 70 minutes. Despite their unassailable lead, Villa continued to push forward in search of further goals and Harewood claimed his first goal since his move to the club and the fifth of the game when he struck from close range from Maloney's corner seven minutes later."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
