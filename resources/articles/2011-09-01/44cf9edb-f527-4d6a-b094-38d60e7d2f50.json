As a former politician and a psychiatrist, I am fascinated both by politics and by human affairs. I am curious that, despite Enoch Powell's widely quoted cautionary observation (on Joseph Chamberlain in 1977), so many politicians plough on regardless, well past their sell-by date, gradually but inexorably allowing their reputation to be tarnished. The guillotine can fall very suddenly. That's the strength of our democracy. But politicians do not lose just their role; they lose their identity, their working relationships and, possibly, their livelihood. So what happens to them? What are the consequences for the defeated individual? What are the consequences for their partners and families? Other than at an anecdotal level, we don't know. Of course, there are some who choose to step down : even if some may have read the electoral runes, others may go entirely on their own terms at a time of their choosing. They appear to be a relatively select bunch. How do they make the decision to go? What are the key factors that determine it? Are these politicians significantly different from their colleagues who remain in office? And despite the fact that they have chosen to step down, how do they adjust? Although it is MPs who are normally the focus of attention, these considerations apply just as much to elected representatives in a local council, in a devolved administration, and at a European level. The issue is about the nature and the effects of holding and losing political office, whatever the level of governance. There appears to be surprisingly little written about these issues. There is an extensive literature from psychology looking at the effects of job loss and unemployment. Many of these findings are likely to be very relevant. The experience of bereavement and loss more generally, drawn from attachment theory, offers very useful insights, but there are additional considerations to take into account. Politicians are elected in a democratic contest: candidates put themselves forward, as individuals as well as for their politics, for very public and potentially exposing scrutiny. As well as relationships with their constituencies, politicians become a member of an exclusive club, whether in Strasbourg, the town hall or the House of Commons, full of both camaraderie and rivalry. Loss of political office may therefore be experienced in an intensely personal manner and, not uncommonly, be felt as a betrayal by an ungrateful electorate. Most writing on political power has been on how to acquire and maintain it, best exemplified, of course, by Machiavelli in the 16th century. In contrast, there is a striking paucity on how to relinquish power. There are more personal accounts from those at the top of the political tree, most recently from Tony Blair and his courtier Jonathan Powell from the heights of the Labour government, or a more modest view from the foothills from Chris Mullin. Once acquired, political power is not easy to step away from and the loss of position is generally involuntary \u2013 that is the nature of political power. But with so little debate on the issue, I wonder if we make it even more difficult for politicians to relinquish power than might otherwise be the case? Does it matter, aside from at a human level? I suggest that it does, and that there may be wider implications for our democratic system. We risk our politicians seeking to stay in office for longer than they are effective as representatives; turnover, at least in \"safe seats\", is likely to be diminished, with less likelihood of new blood coming through; and, most worryingly in an era of democratic disengagement, an increasing separation of the political class from those whom they represent. The Councillors Commission that I chaired four years ago took up the theme of the relationship between elected members, in this case councillors, and their constituents. One of the five principles for effective political representation that we recommended in our report for the Department for Communities and Local Government stated that elected representatives should share similar life experiences to those whom they represented. Yet this is not generally the perception of the relationship despite the undoubted hard, committed work of most politicians. I suggest that while it is possible for long-standing elected representatives to maintain a good sense of their constituents' experiences \u2013 to see the world through their constituents' eyes \u2013 they risk becoming insulated from them. Furthermore, at a national level, politicians are starting their parliamentary career at a younger age with more limited experience. With the rise of the \"career politician\", there is an increasing number of politicians in the UK who have never known any other life. The prospect of losing political power for this group may well be even more unthinkable. Does this mean that there should be structural mechanisms to limit any politician's term? Possibly, but there are downsides (not least, no politician will ever vote for them). But let's have the conversation. More importantly, we need to change the debate about the culture of our democratic system and confront more openly the loss of political power and its consequences.
