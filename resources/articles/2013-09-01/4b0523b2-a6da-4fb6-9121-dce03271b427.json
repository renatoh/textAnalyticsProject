Might see you in the Comments below. 'Night. Anyway, I'm determined to leave you with an upbeat message, so... Please tune in next week when the third episode of Later... will include James Blake, Franz Ferdinand, the Guardian New Band of the Day-approved Radkey, and Goldfrapp, and will hopefully be the thrilling mix-up of opposites I was expecting from this week's show. Oh, and less murky sonics, please. I'm a novice at this liveblogging lark so apologies for any newbie errors but by tomorrow there should be an opportunity for you to vote for your favourite act tonight as per this poll last week, so keep 'em peeled. And Catherine Crilly thought Monae was the best thing on Jools for eons, even if the Laurie/Holland pianofest was a \"smugathon\" too far... Lloydie was captivated by Chvrches... Someone called Muzzer Daftbat was so excited by Pixies on Jools that she started clapping them. While alone in a hotel room. So not everyone was put off by the muddy sound and lacklustre performance. A mixed bag of responses to the episode, ranging from the ecstatic to the meh. Someone called Lauren Leahy has suggested that \"there is a lot of drivel on Later...\". But then Phil Fernley got \"blown away\". Hmmm. I was a bit underwhelmed by that episode. What do you think? Was looking forward to being seduced by Tony Joe, barnstormed by Barrence, taking to new R&amp;B extremes by Janelle, frozen in awe by Chvrches and obliterated by Pixies and I kind of wasn't. Maybe I was too anxious about the demands of liveblogging. Readers, did full concentration afford you the total annihilation of the senses that I lacked? It's Wave of Mutilation - not quite as incendiary as you might have liked. Pixies to finish. The climactic band of the '80s, closing the second episode of Later... Janelle is back, vamping like there's no tomorrow. She's got a full band with her, and they're working the room. It still feels like a critic's dream rather than something designed to massively cross over to, like, actual people, but there's no denying the excellence of that performance. Mind you, under that hat and in those shades, it could be anyone. Has he had the Rick Rubin treatment yet? He should. Tony Joe White, 70 years young, a man who has had his songs covered by Elvis and duetted with Johnny Cash, is giving it some living legend. Ah, some sweaty rock'n'soul from Barrence Whitfield. Whatever did happen to Alabama Shakes? Someone has just called it Boogie Overload. Not sure if they meant it as a compliment. Ah, Jools and Hugh playing some boogie-woogie piano from 1916. Bliss, for some. For others, some idea of hell... He's about as convincing a bluesy soul man as he is a doctor. Apparently, his new direction is Argentinian. Jools is about to show a clip. Hugh Laurie is being interviewed now. Did we know Hugh Laurie was going to be interviewed? Yes, I was there when they bought their instruments and I sadly waved them off as they left home for their first rehearsal. Made their sarnies and everything. And now they're on big, grown-up telly. Chvrches now. Hate to blow my own trumpet (mainly cos I don't own one) but I virtually discovered this lot way back in the mists of time. Here come Pixies. Already some tweeters are missing Kim (v 1.0). Still, good to have them back on the box, even if it's not quite as epochal as some might have liked. Muddy sound, too. From Kansas, it's Janelle Monae! She's still rocking the black and white look. And is it just me or is there a bit of a chasm between Janelle's heavy-duty future-sci-fi concepts and the retro-R&amp;B music she peddles? Because this is R&amp;B - '60s style. Heartbreaker can't decide whether to watch Chvrches on Later... or Bad Education. Toughie. Wonder what they go for...? Hello, good evening, and welcome - he said, in the manner of the late, great Sir David Frost. It's Tuesday, it's 9.45pm, and it's - not Crackerjack, no, that went out at 5pm on a Friday. No, it's week two of the latest series of Later... with Jools Holland. And it's a pretty stellar lineup. There's (cue drum roll)... Pixies! Minus one Kim (Deal), but with another (Kim Shattuck, who in case you were worried hasn't split up her band the Muffs to do this) in her place. This is being trumpeted by the BBC as the band's \"long-awaited return to British TV\". Janelle Monae! Promoting a second album, Electric Lady, that was described in the Guardian recently as \"audacious, intrepid and brilliantly executed\". Tony Joe White! The American singer-songwriter whose most famous hit, Polk Salad Annie, was covered by Elvis Presley. Chvrches, the blog-buzzy Scottish trio who were in the BBC Sound of 2013 poll in January and are finally releasing their debut album on Monday. And Barrence Whitfield &amp; The Savages! That's not Barrence Whitfield, the US R&amp;B/soul singer, performing a duet with the all-female postpunk band Savages, by the way. That's just the name of his backing band. Whitefield's real name, also by the way, is Barry White. Barry White doing a cover version of Savages' Husbands would have been good. Don't be scared, readers. Below is a photo of me Liveblogging. The reason my mouth is agape is I've seen the lineup for tonight's show, and it's good. And I've also realised I've got several thousand examples of an entirely defunct music format on my wall."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
