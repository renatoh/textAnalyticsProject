Colchester United, having beaten Coventry in the fourth round, represented the last chance of providing the Cup with a sprinkling of magic but it was not to be. A tie lacking in drama and class was won by Sheffield United just past the hour yesterday with the game's one stiletto stab. Alan Wright's free-kick on the right, delivered at pace, was headed home at the near post by Paul Peschisolido. It was a moment of such startling clarity as to make all the home fans wonder what on earth their side had been doing for the previous 60 minutes, as they ran around in a fog of self-doubt. Colchester came to make life difficult and, like a piece of grit in a bed, had the home side turning this way and that in an attempt to settle themselves. But it was as if they were too tired to search out what was irritating them so much. With only Wayne Andrews in a forward position, Colchester cramped and crowded the midfield and were aided and abetted in this tactic throughout the first half by the Sheffield United players who, when they did get hold of the ball, immediately gave it away as if it were a hot coal. The answer was blindingly obvious: width. However Peter Ndlovu, recently returned from African Nations Cup duty, appeared unable to sustain any lasting thoughts of stretching play, constantly drifting inside to the wrath of his manager, while both home full-backs were seemingly equally reluctant to push themselves into spaces. Perhaps it was the raw pace of Andrews that unnerved the whole home defence, where Mike Whitlow and Robert Page gave the impression of passing strangers. And this forced the whole of the back four to defend too deep. Colchester were neat and active without ever suggesting they might cause anything major in the way of problems. Paul Tierney had his moments when linking with Joe Keith on the left but Sheffield, for all their lack of cohesion and general lumpiness, still had the better of the first-half chances, with Wayne Allison and Phil Jagielka missing badly. Allison could be excused for being off balance but the full-back's miss was, well, full-backish. The crowd grew ever more frustrated although it was nothing compared with Neil Warnock, whose blood vessels were on bursting alert for virtually the whole of the first half. \"We should have been cruising,\" the manager said later. \"I counted eight chances and you cannot class them as anything other than sitters. We are talking about chances my five-year-old daughter could have scored.\" No doubt their dressing room was not a place for quiet and introspective meditation at the interval. \"I came in at half-time and you would think we had just been relegated to the Third Division with crowds of about 7,000 watching us,\" Warnock added. \"I looked round for about 30 seconds and I just said, 'I cannot believe you lot. Just look at you.' \"I added that it's just a game of football and all we had done was miss three or four sitters. I know I would give my right arm to be playing against Colchester in the fifth round of this competition.\" Colchester must have known what was in store. Yet, when Dries Boussatta hooked another shot wide from an excellent position early in the second half, they may have felt a replay was a distinct possibility. An awful error by Wright, who had his bacon saved by Page, provided further evidence that the First Division club, who had lost their previous three games, were living on their nerves. Then came Peschisolido's goal. Colchester continued to play to the best of their ability, with half-chances for Kem Izzet and Karl Duguid. And it was to their considerable credit that Sheffield United's defence had to remain alert to the end. For Warnock and his players, who reached the semi-final last year, it was another big win, albeit from a distinctly poor performance. For Colchester it was a disappointingly gentle exit. \"I fancy anyone but Birmingham,\" said Peschisolido, who is married to the St Andrews club's managing director Karren Brady. \"I just don't want Birmingham because I know the media will want silly quotes from me because of my missus. Let's hope we get someone else because I won't get in too much trouble for that. I would rather face the likes of Manchester United or Arsenal.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
