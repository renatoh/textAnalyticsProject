But many commentators believe the game has changed in recent months. Stockbrokers, punch-drunk from the battering of the past 18 months, are still, by and large, hooked on picking company shares that will see big capital gains. But chucking your next slug of cash into tomorrow's super-growth industry is making the same mistake again. Now, investors are keen to maximise the yield from their equity investments. Capital gain becomes less important than the income on offer. Remember, however, the yield from a shareholding is not the same as the dividend income. It measures the rate of gain rather than the cash dividend itself. If you buy a share for \u00a31 and the dividend payment is 5p, the yield is 5%. But if the share value falls to 50p, then the yield doubles to 10%. Hilary Cook of Barclays Stockbrokers says: \"Yields have become more important in the last 18 months and as share prices fall that is only going to become a more important factor.\" She says the recent decision to kick out most of the dot.coms, telecoms and media companies from the FTSE 100 index, many of which either never produced a dividend or had cut them back, provides buyers with a cheap way of buying stocks that produce income more than they do growth - an FTSE 100 tracker fund. But if you want the income from shares to go into your pocket, rather than back into a fund, she backs holding \"defensive\" stocks. Cook recommends pharmaceuticals, especially GlaxoWellcome. She says oil companies are undervalued - her favourite is BP. Among the food retailers she picks Safeway. Food producers are also high on her list - Cadbury Schweppes is her tip for the top in this sector. Fred Robinson of stockbrokers Killik &amp; Co argues that defensive stocks give share buyers \"double bubble\": they provide an income, and also underpin the share price and allow a company to ride out many of the markets ups and downs. \"That's what makes them a good defensive stock,\" he says. Pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors are still strong areas. He also likes the oil industry. Among food producers, he points to Northern Foods as having consistently delivered a steady and rising income stream. \"You must look at companies and see where they are in the life cycle of their industry. BT was once a steady income provider, but is now going through much upheaval and unlikely to produce dividends for some time.\" He says finance companies are also ones to watch but banks should be treated with care: \"If we go into a recession then they must cover their bad debts and this can easily wipe out their profits.\" But he likes the look of insurer CGNU which has announced that its exposure to the disaster in New York is only \u00a335m - a figure that will hardly dent its profits of around \u00a31bn a year. All financial advisers warn share buyers to invest for at least five years, whether they are interested in an income stream or still trying to catch the next big wave of growth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
