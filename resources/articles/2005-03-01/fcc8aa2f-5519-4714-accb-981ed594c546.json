Twenty-four hours after England play Italy, the fly-half may be among the Newcastle replacements for their Zurich Premiership meeting across the road against Harlequins at The Stoop. Wilkinson features among 11 replacements named by Newcastle's director of rugby Rob Andrew, who will finalise his seven-strong bench on Sunday morning after conducting various late fitness checks. Wilkinson has been sidelined since early January, when he damaged knee ligaments during Newcastle's Heineken Cup defeat at Perpignan, but a successful return this weekend could put him in contention for a first international since the World Cup final when England meet Scotland the following Saturday. Andrew said: \"He has done everything with us this week, including live contact and kicking, so there is every chance he will take some part on Sunday. If Jonny plays, is fully fit on Monday, then it becomes a selection call for England, which is nothing to do with us as a club.\" Ludovic Mercier, the French fly-half and hero at Gloucester for two years, is about to return to Kingsholm. The 28-year-old was part of the team that ran away with the Zurich championship in 2002 and the Powergen Cup a year later, but left for Grenoble at the end of the 2003 season before moving on to Pau. \"We didn't want him to go in the first place,\" a club spokesman said yesterday. \"He kicked his goals, which is something we haven't been doing recently.\" The man doing the kicking at the moment is the England international Henry Paul, but he missed three kickable penalties on Sunday when Gloucester lost their cup semi-final to Bath. But the club has denied that Mercier's return would mean the Departure of either Paul or their injured Australian fly-half Duncan McRae. Gloucester have also spoken to the Bradford Bulls' New Zealand rugby league international Lesley Vainikolo."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
