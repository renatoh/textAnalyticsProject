Henry IV had other things to consider than whether Steve Harmison should have a short leg but no one, surely, ever believes that the role of England cricket captain - unique among sports in its executive nature - is merely a breezy passport to a tidy pension in the media. So uneasily had Nasser Hussain slept over the previous six months that on the final day of the first Test at Edgbaston he resigned his post as one of the country's premier Test captains and handed it to Michael Vaughan. If it was a selfless act, performed in the team interest, or a selfish one to protect his sanity and reputation as a leader (and you can take your choice on that one), it was surely ill-timed and left the side in the lurch. Vaughan had been thrust into a job that he wanted but with barely a couple of days to come to terms with his elevation. The team were disrupted, confused even, and in the second Test at Lord's they played like it. They were dismal and rudderless, tottering from one disaster to another until Andrew Flintoff leavened the mood with his flogging, clogging century. Vaughan has had four matches in charge and already experienced such peaks and troughs that he must simultaneously be suffering from altitude sickness and the bends. He has won two Tests and lost two, and there has been no middle ground: the teams he has led have either been tremendous or awful. Monday's emotive triumph at The Oval should be kept in perspective, something that was encapsulated in the relative moods of the two leaders involved. If Vaughan was overjoyed for his side Graeme Smith, no more experienced, was a disappointed man. For each, sharing the series was the difference between a half-full glass and a half-empty one. Yet we should not criticise Vaughan for that. He had been handed a hot potato when he did not expect it and somehow, in that final Test, managed to rally his players and pull the series out of the fire. His pre-match assertion that it had been a \"fantastic summer for English cricket\" would have looked bland had the series been lost by three Tests to one, a statistic that was odds-on after the first day at The Oval. Rather like, in fact, saying that the main act was dreadful but, hey, the support band was fun so it must have been a great gig. Attention to body language would help. There has been an element of anonymity about Vaughan on the field and, if it is apparent to those on the periphery, then it must be so in the middle. He does not have the obvious presence of Smith, or Hussain, or Steve Waugh. That comes at the crease, and nowhere else. Vaughan, somewhat unwisely, announced that he intended to be thoroughly democratic and then found himself trying to read the riot act. It is hard to change tack from good guy into toughie and not be treated with incredulity. He also confesses to finding the job stressful, and the runs have dried up for the time being. That, though, may be more a function of the distance he has had to fall. No batsman can maintain indefinitely the standard that he set during the previous year and, if Vaughan needs encouragement not to be seduced into dropping down the order, then he should know that three of his four long-term predecessors, Mike Atherton, Graham Gooch and Alec Stewart, went in first (albeit Stewart did so in only six innings) and each outperformed his career average. As Gooch, in particular, pointed out, he could lead by example at the top of the order, setting the agenda. Vaughan has done extremely well to help England survive a most testing series. But the real trial comes now, after a brief period of reflection. Thus far he has acted as a substitute (his first side had been selected before Hussain's plans were known) and it will only be this winter, especially in the Caribbean next year, that a far better picture of his capabilities will emerge. He will be able to draw a line under the events of this summer, good and bad, distance himself and move on. These past few months have been a busk and he should not be judged overly on them. The real thing starts now."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
