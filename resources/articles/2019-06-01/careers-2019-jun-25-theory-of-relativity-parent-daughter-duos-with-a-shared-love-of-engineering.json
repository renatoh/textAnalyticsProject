In his spare time, he fixed radios and clocks, and that fascinated me as a child. I was keen to get into his shed and see what he was doing. That developed my interest in finding out about things, making them work, and fixing them. That followed through to my daughter, Ruth. She always had an interest in understanding things. We had a computer in the early days of computers and we\u2019d use it together. We\u2019d do anything from setting it up to artistic stuff, such as drawing pictures together. With time, that interaction has increased, not decreased, which is wonderful. She might ask me to look at some maths, or to tidy up a bit of code. It\u2019s good because it\u2019s kept me up to date with technology \u2013 I\u2019m learning as much as I ever taught her. I have a wife, three daughters and a son. My son is also an engineer and Ruth\u2019s elder sister is a mathematician. My wife and other daughter will joke about how they feel a bit left out at times, but it\u2019s a good family dynamic. I\u2019m proud of Ruth. In particular, I\u2019m proud because she\u2019s not been afraid to operate in a largely male-dominated profession, and I imagine that must be hard. Engineering is changing [in terms of becoming more gender-equal] and that\u2019s good. I think my grandad would have been proud of Ruth, too. Ruth John, 37 Self-employed digital engineer and computer programmer Because dad worked with tech there was always tech around when I was growing up, and we always had a computer in the house. In the early days of computers, we\u2019d get the computer out at weekends and it would be a special occasion. Dad would build the computers \u2013 he didn\u2019t just buy them off the shelf. When I was a teenager, the internet came along and me and my elder sister would play games together. We were always comfortable using computers, they were just normal to us. Mum also taught her daughters that we could grow up to do anything. She would do things such as edit Enid Blyton stories when she read them to us to make sure they all went on adventures. The girls don\u2019t actually go on adventures in Blyton\u2019s stories \u2013 I only realised that when I reread them as a teenager. We talk about engineering a lot at home; when we\u2019re having dinner at Christmas, for example, we can get into quite in-depth conversations about programming or audio. It\u2019s really good to get my dad\u2019s perspective, but everyone else gets annoyed with our geeky conversations. I love making things digitally. You can do whatever you want once you learn to code. Louise Taylor, 50 Commissioning officer at Dorset County council As a child, it never occurred to me to go into engineering. Then I got a part-time job in a design office [where engineers worked]. I was working really hard for other people and I wanted to do what they were doing. So I used to go into my boss\u2019s office every week and ask him to send me to college, so I could become an engineer, too. Finally, after five years of nagging, my boss said he would send me to college. That was his retirement present to me. I had only just had Gemma [my daughter], so initially I thought it was the wrong time, but I made myself do it anyway. I found the course interesting and stimulating. What I love about my job now is you can improve people\u2019s working and living environments. For example, it\u2019s your job to make sure there\u2019s enough light and air inside a building. Gemma originally wanted to become an architect, but I think that was just to annoy me \u2013 architects are more form and we\u2019re more function, so there\u2019s always a balance to strike between the two. Engineering gives us a common link, so we\u2019re not just mother and daughter and can have interesting work discussions. Gemma Taylor, 25 Building physics and services engineer at Services Design Solution (SDS) I work on the stuff that\u2019s hidden within buildings. So that means if nobody\u2019s complaining they\u2019re too hot or too cold, I\u2019ve done a good job. Growing up, my mum was a role model to me and I felt like there were no bounds to what I could achieve. Since the age of about five, I would go in to work with her. It never crossed my mind that she was one of only about two women in the office, though. Sometimes I\u2019d sit and draw pictures. Other times I\u2019d make cups of tea for everyone. One of her male colleagues even gave me a teddy bear once and I\u2019ve still got it to this day. When I was a bit older, we went out on building sites. We\u2019d put on hard hats and boots and walk around. I noticed mum wasn\u2019t afraid to say if something was wrong and that it needed to be redone, and that people respected her because it was her job. At first, I wanted to be an architect, but I think I was just fighting against the trend and mum probably always knew I\u2019d end up being an engineer. She doesn\u2019t realise how much she\u2019s helped me. We\u2019re always interacting and we talk on the phone most days. She helps me with my work and we bounce ideas off each other. She\u2019s my mum so we work in a similar way. She talks herself down, but I just want to make her proud. Download our women in engineering supplement (pdf)"}, "isHosted": false}}}
