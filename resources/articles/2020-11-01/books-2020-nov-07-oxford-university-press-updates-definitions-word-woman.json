Among the updates to Oxford Dictionaries\u2019 definitions is the acknowledgement that a woman can be \u201ca person\u2019s wife, girlfriend, or female lover\u201d, rather than only a man\u2019s. The entry for \u201cman\u201d has also been amended to include the same gender-neutral terminology, while many other terms relating to sexual attractiveness and activity have been revised. Labels have been applied to terms identified as \u201cderogatory\u201d, \u201coffensive\u201d or \u201cdated\u201d, such as the word \u201cbitch\u201d and \u201cbint\u201d, which are listed as synonyms for the word woman. An OUP spokeswoman said the changes were made after its dictionary compilers undertook an \u201cextensive review\u201d of entries \u201cfor \u2018woman\u2019 and many other related terms\u201d. The review was triggered following a petition last year criticising the dictionaries\u2019 inclusion of bitch, bint, wench and other offensive remarks, among its list of synonyms for women. Campaigners argued that the examples the dictionaries offered for \u201cman\u201d were also much more exhaustive than those for \u201cwoman\u201d and presented women as \u201csubordinate or \u201can irritation\u201d. \u201cMs September will embody the professional yet sexy career woman,\u201d read one example. Another spoke of \u201cmale fisherfolk who take their catch home for the little woman to gut\u201d. The petition called for all phrases and definitions that \u201cdiscriminate and patronise\u201d or \u201cconnote men\u2019s ownership\u201d of women to be eliminated. It also demanded that the entry of \u201cwoman\u201d be enlarged and include examples representative of minorities such as transgender women and lesbian women. The leaders of Women\u2019s Aid and the Women\u2019s Equality party threw their weight behind the campaign this year on International Women\u2019s Day, by signing an open letter calling on OUP to change the \u201csexist\u201d definitions. \u201cBitch is not a synonym for woman. It is dehumanising to call a woman a bitch. It is but one sad, albeit extremely damaging, example of everyday sexism. And that should be explained clearly in the dictionary entry used to describe us,\u201d it read. Maria Beatrice Giovanardi, who started the petition, which has reached 30,000 signatures, was \u201cvery happy\u201d with the changes and felt the campaign had achieved 90% of its aims. She said the inclusion of gender-neutral terminology in the dictionaries\u2019 relationship examples marked \u201ca huge step forward for the LGBTQI people\u201d. \u201cIt is respecting their love and unions,\u201d she added. But she remained \u201cdisappointed\u201d that the word bitch \u2013 defined as a \u201cspiteful, unpleasant, or disliked woman\u201d \u2013 continued to be listed as a synonym, albeit now labelled as \u201coffensive\u201d. She contrasted this to the classification of the word dickhead \u2013 defined \u201cas a stupid, irritating, or ridiculous man\u201d \u2013 which is considered \u201cvulgar slang\u201d and not included in the list of synonyms for men. An OUP spokeswoman said their dictionaries \u201creflect, rather than dictate, how language is used. This is driven solely by evidence of how real people use English in their daily lives. \u201cThis independent editorial approach means that our dictionaries provide an accurate representation of language, even where it means recording senses and example uses of words that are offensive or derogatory, and which we wouldn\u2019t necessarily employ ourselves.\u201d The OUP said its review has developed into an ongoing project to re-examine our treatment of language, with recent work undertaken around race and racial diversity and on the use of \u201cthey\u201d as a pronoun for people whose gender identity is neither exclusively male nor female."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
