More than 3,000 GPs responded to an online poll organised by an internet service called doctors.net.uk. Most (72%) of the doctors felt that quality of care for patients has not improved despite huge cash injections since 2002. The BMA has weighed in, with deputy chairman Mark Porter saying, \"The results of this survey are disturbing and give a snapshot view of how demoralised and frustrated some doctors are feeling.\" So, is it true? As a patient, is your experience of the NHS likely to be better in 2007 than it was in 2002, before the billions were poured in? Obviously, it depends who you ask. The NHS is a vast and complex organisation. You get good and bad practice. A patient had his right hip replaced five years ago at the local hospital, and the other replaced on the same ward and with the same consultant, just a few months ago. The first hip replacement was hunky dory. Everything went well. Care was good. Nurses pleasant, doctors danced in attendance and he emerged without even a hint of MRSA or hospital-acquired nastiness. The second hip replacement was a catalogue of disasters. Horrible nurse on the night shift, doctors invisible and a going-home gift of MRSA. That patient would rate the NHS as having been excellent in 2002 and crap now. But it's bad luck, and anecdotal, and that doesn't really tell you much about whether our tax money has been well-spent in the intervening years. The doctors who filled in this survey don't necessarily known much either. No disrespect, but 40% of those who responded were young and had qualified in the past seven years. They are hardly well-placed to judge whether things are better or worse than they were before this government came to power - some would have been just starting secondary school when Labour started swinging into action. So, how to judge whether it's been a colossal waste of our money or the path to a far better service? No one is disinterested or well-informed enough to know the truth. And, at a guess, I'd say, boringly, that it's a bit of both. IT is the key to joined-up medical care. The government's \u00a320bn investment in IT is still going through hideous birth pangs, and it's hard to see tangible results yet. And yet, the day when we all carry our own medical information on a credit card-sized chip shouldn't be too far off (they've got it in France and are trialling it here.) That's going to be a huge step forward. You will own all the information about yourself, and the days of lost notes, mislaid x-rays and waiting months for results should be consigned to the dustbin of history - and that will be a very good thing. GPs, meanwhile, are pissed off because we like to have control over our own small empires - sorry, practices. Many of us remember halcyon days of being fundholders, when we controlled our own budgets and bought in services for our patients. Labour scrapped it because practices which weren't fundholders were missing out. Big mistake, in my opinion. It's been replaced by encouraging groups of practices to band together and form medium-sized consortia that buy in services for patients. These units are called practice based commissioning. But they're too big, too unwieldy, and GPs like myself are wary of getting involved as we're still mourning the loss of fundholding that worked so well. So what end-of-term report would I give the government? Top marks for improving waiting times, especially for cancer referrals. Good marks for finding the money. Well done for at least tackling the thorny problem of IT. Good effort for rewarding GPs for improving patient care. But ... can be reckless and fail to listen carefully to what patients say. Must relinquish control a bit. Tendency to overmeddle. Overall: could do better."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
