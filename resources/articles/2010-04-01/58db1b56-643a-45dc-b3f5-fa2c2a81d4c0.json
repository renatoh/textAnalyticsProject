Bluebells and dog's mercury creep outwards from hedgebanks to mix with plots of lucifer \u2013 a dainty but hardy old-fashioned narcissus with orange cup and cream petals. Tree shadows extend across the rough ground where uncurling ferns, leafing elderflower, honeysuckle and bramble are tangled with fallen branches. Patches of moschatel, or townhall clock, with its little flowers arranged like clockfaces around a tower, get larger every year and the fragrant white actaea still grows in rows alongside fading carlton daffodils. The oldest type of daffodil once cultivated in the valley is the double Van Sion, dating from the 17th century. It usually flowers in early March and often marks the sites of historic orchards. This year it emerged late and the butter-coloured blooms are still remarkable, poking up through shrivelled bracken on roadside banks. Further west, flowering magnolias, camellias and rhododendrons attract visitors to the spectacular garden of Caerhayes Castle on the south coast. Swards are full of pale primroses and burnished celandines, scattered with the large petals of early magnolias, ranging in colour from white to cream, pink and purple. From clearings are glimpses of the \"Cornish Alps\", the china clay tips, to the north beyond St Austell; of rolled, greened-up pastures; and the sparkling sea fringed with little waves. Outside the gatehouse, the sheltered cove is crowded with family groups enjoying the sun and even swimming in the cold but calm blue sea."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
