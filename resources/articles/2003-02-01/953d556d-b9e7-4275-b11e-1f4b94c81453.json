Bird is understood to have ended his five-year stint at the club as a result of his deteriorating relationship with the chairman David Bernstein, whose own position may come under threat at an emergency board meeting next week. Warring factions in the City boardroom are split over the level of backing on offer to Kevin Keegan. The former England coach has spent over \u00a340m in less than two years at the helm and some in the boardroom are keen to take the club's spending even further. The deputy chairman John Wardle and his business partner David Makin are ready to sanction further funds for Keegan to launch a summer spending spree. Bird and Dennis Tueart are firmly in the Wardle-Makin camp. But Bernstein is reluctant to continue the big-spending policy before City's switch to the City of Manchester Stadium at the start of next season. Bird has refused to comment on his decision to quit his \u00a3170,000-a-year post after being told he must serve 12 months' notice."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
