Last year, the online newspaper eldiario.es reported that the app allowed the league to remotely activate the microphone on a mobile phone to determine whether the device\u2019s owner was in a bar that hadn\u2019t paid to screen the match. According to the Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD), such use of the app \u2013 which has been downloaded by more than 4 million people \u2013 violated transparency principles. On Wednesday, La Liga said that it would launch a legal challenge against the AEPD\u2019s fine. \u201cWe profoundly disagree with this decision, consider the fine that has been imposed to be unfair, and believe the AEPD hasn\u2019t made enough effort to understand how this technology works,\u201d La Liga said in a statement. \u201cAs a result, we will challenge the decision to show that we have always acted legally and responsibly.\u201d In the statement, La Liga stressed that the technology could not be used to learn the contents of conversations, nor to identify any participants. However, it also defended its right to protect its business interests. \u201cLa Liga would not be acting diligently if it did not use all means at its disposal to fight against piracy,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cThis is a major undertaking given the scale of the fraud in the market, which is estimated to cost around \u20ac400m a year.\u201d At the end of last month, La Liga said it had worked with police to bring down an alleged match-fixing ring targeting Spain\u2019s top three football leagues. The country\u2019s national police force said its officers had carried out nine searches across Spain in connection with match-fixing, money laundering and criminal gangs, and had made several arrests. La Liga said it had reported its suspicions over a division two match in May last year between Deportiva Huesca and Gimna\u0301stic Tarragona. Spanish media reported that those arrested included the former Real Madrid and Spain player Ra\u00fal Bravo, Agust\u00edn Lasaosa, the Huesca president, and several other people connected with the club."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
