The other headline-grabber was the warning that bosses risk being viewed as \"aliens\" on pay. That speech has had no discernible effect on boardroom behaviour. Will 's blast at the government's failure \"to articulate in big-picture terms its vision of what the UK economy might become under its stewardship\" fare better? It deserves to. Lambert scored well in three ways. His analysis of the risks the government is taking was correct. The substance was powerful because it detailed a long list of compromises and false starts. And the timing was good: we may learn that the economy slowed sharply at the end of last year. Lambert is merely talking common sense when he says that \"public sector cuts and private sector growth are two sides of the same coin\". If you intend to shrink the economy by slashing departmental spending, you must ensure that growth will arrive to replace the lost tax revenues. \"Measures that cut spending but killed demand would actually make matters worse,\" said Lambert. That sentiment might be applauded on both sides of the debate but the point-by-point explanation of how the government is failing to encourage growth \u2013 the heart of the speech \u2013 will wound. The growth white paper? It never appeared. An aviation policy? There isn't one. The Green Investment Bank? Too unambitious. The localism agenda? Created uncertainty in the planning system. The regulator's mortgage review? Poorly timed. So it went on. There were warm words on business taxes (inevitably, given the coming cuts in corporation tax) but Lambert also called for a similar roadmap for personal taxes. In one sense, the speech was an appeal for better treatment for small and medium-sized companies, the job creators. The image of the prime minister summoning a few bosses of multinationals when he wants to talk about trade is powerful because it is accurate. But it would be wrong to think of Lambert as engaging in mere special pleading. He was also alleging that the government doesn't even understand how to help business."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
