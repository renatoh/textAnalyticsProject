For the player who has become the embodiment of the club\u2019s golden era under the ownership of Roman Abramovich, the atmosphere during the priceless victory over Sunderland must have felt very strange indeed. \u201cThe fans showed the loyalty they have for Jos\u00e9 Mourinho,\u201d reflected John Terry after goals from Branislav Ivanovic, Pedro and Oscar eased some of the pressure on the reigning Premier League champions. \u201cThe memories he has brought to this club from 2004 and 2005 and last year, the fans will never forget that. There is obviously disappointment from a lot of them and rightly so because of what he has achieved at the club. We had to stand up and be counted.\u201d No matter where you looked at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, the shadow of \u201cthe individual\u201d was never too far away. From the supporters queuing to have their picture taken sitting next to Mourinho in the squad photo that adorns the wall outside the ground to Michael Emenalo seated inconspicuously three rows behind Steve Holland \u2013 in charge for this match \u2013 it felt as if the seismic events of the last few days could spill into open mutiny before kick-off. Spotting Emenalo, who had refused to refer to Mourinho by name when he lifted the lid on the \u201cpalpable discord\u201d that had existed between the manager and his players, one fan unveiled a banner that urged the board to reinstate the Special One and sack the technical director \u2013 described as \u201cthe one who does nothing\u201d \u2013 instead. He made a hasty retreat to the back of the stand when approached by a steward but there were plenty of other examples of open dissent dotted around the stadium. Scoring two goals inside the first 13 minutes, first when Ivanovic headed home from a corner \u2013 greeted by an extravagant pump of the fist by Emenalo \u2013 and then Pedro\u2019s smart finish after a mistake from Sebasti\u00e1n Coates, served only to heighten frustration in the stands. \u201cWhere were you when we were shit?\u201d asked the fans. Given the vast improvement all over the pitch, led by a virtuoso performance in midfield from Oscar, they were entitled to wonder. The Brazilian\u2019s penalty three minutes following the break after Willian was felled by Costel Pantilimon was enough to make sure of the win, although the old jitters did return when Fabio Borini soon pulled one back for Sunderland. Had Jermain Defoe packed his shooting boots, it could have been a different story for Sam Allardyce\u2019s relegation battlers. Late on the substitutions of Chelsea\u2019s Cesc F\u00e0bregas and Diego Costa were greeted by a chorus of boos from some sections of the ground \u2013 Emenalo making a point of rising to his feet to applaud the players. But when Abramovich and the newly installed interim manager, Guus Hiddink, strode across the pitch to speak to the players in the dressing room after the match, Costa was already long gone. \u201cIt\u2019s been a tough few days for sure,\u201d admitted Terry. \u201cWe spoke on Friday about staying together; all of us sticking together \u2013 not just today or tomorrow but over the next five or six months and getting ourselves back up the league table. Unfortunately the manager\u2019s head is on the block, he loses his job and collectively we have to take responsibility for that, which we have done.\u201d That was a common theme among Chelsea\u2019s players and staff. Holland \u2013 who will remain in his post as assistant along with Eddie Newton when Hiddink begins work later this week \u2013 admitted it had been a difficult week for everyone at the club, not least Abramovich, while Pedro acknowledged last week\u2019s performance against Leicester, which eventually cost Mourinho his job, had been \u201cshit\u201d. Sam Allardyce, the Sunderland manager, also got in on the act, having seen his side slump to a third successive defeat that has left them deep in the relegation mire once more. \u201cI have to be honest I saw so many poor performances in the first half that I could have changed all the outfield players. But I haven\u2019t got that option,\u201d said Allardyce, who left his expensive summer signing Jeremain Lens out of his squad for \u201cdisciplinary reasons\u201d, with reports that the Dutchman has been fined two weeks\u2019 wages after refusing to take part in a post-match warm down last week. But after a week when Terry was parted from the manager he described on social media as \u201cthe very best I have EVER worked with\u201d, the final word had to go to him. \u201cWe\u2019ve got strong characters, honestly it all comes down to results,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you are losing games it is difficult to dig people out and pick each other up. After this result the dressing room is buzzing. It\u2019s amazing what one win can do and how it can turn.\u201d On that, at least, Mourinho would surely concur.
