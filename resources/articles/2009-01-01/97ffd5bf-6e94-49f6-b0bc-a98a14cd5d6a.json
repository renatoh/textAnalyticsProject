Billed as a clash between lions and tigers, the game was defined by Attwell, the pantomime lamb to the slaughter. The litany of inconsistent bookings and two decisive decisions before half-time, one resulting in a goal for Hull and the other denying Millwall an equaliser, epitomised a disjointed game, according to the Hull manager, Phil Brown. \"Millwall came with a game plan and that did make it difficult for us, it upset the flow in the first half \u2013 I think the foul count was something like 17 against seven \u2013 and that in itself suggests the game was going to be a rough and tumble game,\" he said. Fifteen minutes in, two defenders combined to give Hull the lead after Attwell acknowledged his assistant's flag and awarded a dubious free-kick on the edge of the Millwall area, which Andy Dawson swung across the six-yard box for Michael Turner to head home unchallenged. Millwall should have been level after the half-hour when the Hull goalkeeper Tony Warner slipped as he went to clear Dawson's back-pass, but just as Izale McLeod looked certain to equalise, the goalkeeper grasped the ball \u2013 thus deliberately handling a back-pass and arguably committing a professional foul. Attwell awarded an indirect free-kick, but prevented Millwall from taking it quickly to gain an advantage. Yet rather than dismissing Warner, the 26-year-old referee simply allowed Hull to bring back all their outfield players for the set-piece. Lewis Grabban predictably shot wide. \"It's a funny situation when there is not even a booking in that instance when the centre-forward is going to roll the ball into the net,\" said the Millwall manager, Kenny Jackett. \"It's a match-changing situation.\" Numerous stoppages for minor altercations led to unflattering chants about the officials being sung by both sets of supporters, but Marc Laird had a glorious chance to equalise with the last kick of a fractious first-half, only to volley over from five yards after McLeod had nodded down Dave Martin's cross. A scrappy, indisciplined and poorly officiated match was finally put to bed on 84 minutes by Ian Ashbee's thunderous 25-yard shot that went in off the crossbar. They say a good referee goes unnoticed, but in Attwell's defence, there was little else worth noticing here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
