Donald Trump pardoned Arpaio in 2017 after he was convicted of contempt of court for violating a federal court order to stop racial profiling against Hispanics. In an interview with the Washington Examiner, the 85-year-old said that he was running as \u201ca big supporter of President Trump\u201d. Arpaio had long been known for his draconian views on illegal immigration and his harsh treatment of prisoners and undocumented immigrants detained while awaiting deportation or transfer to other jurisdictions. He was also an enthusiastic believer in so-called birtherism, the long-running campaign by some hardline conservatives, with Donald Trump as their cheerleader, to convince the public inaccurately that Barack Obama was not born in the USA and therefore was not eligible to be president. Arpaio served six terms as sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, the state\u2019s largest jurisdiction, near Phoenix and the Mexico border, before losing his re-election bid in 2016. Self-anointed as \u201cAmerica\u2019s toughest sheriff\u201d, he gained notoriety during his 24-year tenure for detaining hundreds of undocumented immigrants in a sprawling jail known as Tent City and forcing them to wear pink underwear. The sheriff courted controversy and media attention \u2013 calling his own jail a \u201cconcentration camp\u201d, serving inmates just two meals a day and selling replica pink underwear to the public \u2013 as he became a national figurehead for the virulent xenophobia Trump embraced in his presidential campaign. Trump\u2019s decision to pardon the polarizing sheriff drew condemnation from both of the state\u2019s Republican senators, as well as Democrats and Latino and immigrant advocacy groups. Arpaio is the only person so far to have received a presidential pardon from Trump. The populist and polarizing former sheriff joins a crowded Republican field in the race to succeed vocal Trump critic Jeff Flake, who announced he would not seek re-election. The former sheriff has a complicated history with Flake. He is currently facing a malicious prosecution suit from Flake\u2019s son, who alleges Arpaio prosecuted him for animal cruelty in an attempt to embarrass the Republican senator. Currently, Kelli Ward, a former state senator who has been vocally backed by former White House aide Steve Bannon, is running for Flake\u2019s seat and is expected to be joined by Martha McSally, a two-term congresswoman who was also the first woman to fly in combat. McSally is an establishment favorite who has won multiple tough races in her Tucson-based swing district. The winner of the Republican primary is likely to face Democratic congresswoman Kyrsten Sinema in the November general election. On Tuesday, Flake told reporters: \u201cI won\u2019t be supporting Joe Arpaio.\u201d Of the sheriff\u2019s bid, the Arizona senator joked: \u201cWrite about it fast because it won\u2019t last long.\u201d The Senate race is expected to be one of the most competitive in 2018 and a must-win for Democrats if they are to have any chance of winning control of the Senate in the midterms. Tom Perez, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, said: \u201cJoe Arpaio is one of our nation\u2019s most notorious agents of racism and bigotry,\u201d Perez said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cHe has spent his career tearing apart immigrant families and devastating Latino communities.\u201d As head of the justice department\u2019s civil rights division, Perez sued Arpaio in 2012, alleging long-standing racial profiling of Latinos. Asked about the criticism on Fox News Radio, Arpaio said it was \u201can honor to know he is going after me\u201d. \u201cHe better worry about his own party and not target me,\u201d Arpaio said. \u201cLet him target me, that\u2019s okay, he has been doing it all along anyway.\u201d Critics of Arpaio says his entry in the Senate race could animate Latino voters. \u201cIf Republicans rally behind this monster, they will turn out Latino voters like never before \u2013 in Arizona and across the country,\u201d Crist\u00f3bal Alex, president of Latino Victory Fund, a progressive political action committee, told the Guardian."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
