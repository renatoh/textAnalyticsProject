Speaking at a packed meeting at Finsbury Park mosque in north London called to address a rise in attacks on Muslim women over recent months, the Labour leader said: \u201cA lot of abuse takes place on online media and on social media.\u201d He said he sometimes goes through the \u201ctrain of events of someone who\u2019s been abused\u201d and was shocked at what he found. He had examined social media reaction to comments made by him and Labour MP Diane Abbott following the stabbing of a young Kurdish man in Croydon last year. \u201cIt was unbelievably vile, revolting, disgusting stuff that was thrown particularly at her and to some extent at me \u2026 That\u2019s just not acceptable. These media platforms that are hosting social media conversations must shape up. Racist language is wrong, evil and divisive and should not be allowed.\u201d The Labour leader also criticised mainstream media, echoing repeated complaints voiced by members of the public at the meeting over its distorted reporting of Islam and lack of reporting of Islamophobia. The media\u2019s reporting of attacks on Muslims was \u201cnot sufficient \u2026 [all attacks] should be reported,\u201d Corbyn said. Hate crime must be challenged wherever and however it raises its head, he told the meeting. \u201cAs communities we must stand up for each other.\u201d An attack on any community \u2013 whether it be a mosque, a synagogue or a church \u2013 was an attack on all of us, he said. \u201cNobody should ever feel alone, isolated, at risk because of their faith, the clothing they choose to wear, the lifestyle they lead,\u201d he added. Local Muslims were targeted in an attack in June, when a van ploughed into worshippers outside the Muslim Welfare House, 100 yards from the mosque, shortly after midnight during the holy Islamic month of Ramadan. Makram Ali, 51, died of multiple injuries and 11 people were injured. The attack came amid a sharp rise in Islamophobic attacks in the aftermath of terrorist atrocities in London and Manchester. The London mayor\u2019s office recorded a fivefold increase in anti-Muslim attacks following the London Bridge attack in June. Women were particular targets, especially on public transport, according to monitoring groups. \u201cWe all experience it, and we often don\u2019t even realise it\u2019s a crime,\u201d said one woman in the audience. \u201cVulgar things yelled at us, being pushed, being confronted, being terrorised.\u201d Others spoke of routine harassment and abuse, both in person and online. Some women said they were disappointed by the outcome when they had reported attacks to the police. One said that she and others faced a triple whammy of discrimination as Muslims, ethnic minorities and women. Corbyn said he would continue discussions with Transport for London and the police about how they dealt with reports and complaints. \u201cIf you\u2019re a woman alone and you\u2019ve been abused in the street, or abused where you live or abused anywhere at all, you\u2019ve taken a big step in going to tell the police about it \u2026 There must then be an appropriate response by the police to acknowledge and understand the seriousness of the crime.\u201d He suggested that reporting systems could be put in place in schools, colleges, workplaces and places of worship. Det Supt Treena Fleming drew attention to the Self Evident app, in which hate crime could be reported to the police, evidence could be filmed and statements could be recorded without the need to go to a police station."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
