In an article and a podcast Devine railed against medical professionals for supporting children who choose to transition. In \u201cWhat Madness Can Justify Mutilating Our Children\u201d she talked about a \u201cpernicious social fad for transgenderism in children which has been embraced by an activist subset of the medical profession\u201d and argued that \u201cnew laws in Victoria can punish therapists who oppose transitioning children\u201d. But it was her statement that there was \u201cno evidence\u201d the medical procedures were necessary which was found to be inaccurate and misleading by the Australian Press Council, and a breach of the code. \u201cThe council considered that, given the existence of medical guidelines which recommended various treatments and procedures to assist transitioning children and adolescents, the statement that there was \u2018no evidence\u2019 was made in such absolute terms that it was inaccurate and misleading,\u201d the council said in its adjudication However, the press council also ruled it was OK for Devine to use offensive and prejudicial terms like \u201cmutilation\u201d, \u201cchild surgical abuse\u201d and a \u201cmonstrous assault on their developing bodies\u201d because the language was \u201cjustified in the public interest\u201d. Chorus of criticism for the Australian The Australian, which lost a handful of staffers in the recent cull of 55 News Corp journalists, has also parted ways with two of its best reporters, both of whom chose to throw bombs on the way out. First out the door was social affairs reporter Rick Morton who never returned to reporting after unloading on his own paper in a candid talk with journalism students at UTS. \u201cThere is a real mood that something has gone wrong,\u201d Morton said in a podcast posted online by UTS last month. \u201cPeople will tell you going back a decade it used to be a very great paper, and in many ways it still is, but some of the craziness has been dialled up.\u201d Morton said he has left without a job to go to but is writing another book. Investigative reporter Anthony Klan, who won News Corp Australia\u2019s highest journalistic honour, the Sir Keith Murdoch Award, has revealed he resigned after 15 years on the paper because he had \u201cserious misgivings\u201d about the way the Oz was being run. The high-profile departures followed the publication in Guardian Australia of a widely read opinion piece by the Queensland journalist Tony Koch in which he blasted his former employers for their \u201cshameful bias\u201d towards the Coalition. Another former leading light of the Australian, George Megalogenis, added his voice to the chorus of criticism when he asked Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Holt Street leader Michael Miller if his stable of newspapers could \u201cstop playing politics and return to a journalism first approach at all times\u201d. The paper has, however, also picked up some new reporters under editor-in-chief Chris Dore, who hired BuzzFeed\u2019s political reporter Alice Workman, Your Money\u2019s Leo Shanahan as well as Zoe Samios, Bridget Cormack, Miles Godfrey and Nick Evans. Dore declined to comment on the departures. Collective action All the metropolitan dailies owned by Nine and News Corp and national mastheads the Australian Financial Review and the Australian will run full-page ads on Friday carrying an open letter to Scott Morrison, Anthony Albanese and all the members of parliament about the \u201cgrave threat\u201d to press freedom in Australia posed by the recent AFP raids. \u201cA healthy democracy cannot function without its media being free to bring to light uncomfortable truths, to scrutinise the powerful and inform our communities,\u201d it says. \u201cInvestigative journalism cannot survive without the courage of whistleblowers, motivated by concern for their fellow citizens, who seek to bring to light instances of wrongdoing, illegal activities, fraud, corruption and threats to public health and safety.\u201d The letter has been signed by leading journalists and editors from all the major publications, press clubs and industry bodies and was financially supported by the newspapers. \u201cWe urge parliament to legislate changes to the law to recognise and enshrine a positive public interest protection for whistleblowers and for journalists,\u201d the journalists say. \u201cWithout these protections Australians will be denied important information it is their right as citizens to have. We urge you to take prompt action to protect our democracy for all Australians.\u201d Back on the beat Publisher Anthony Catalano is not wasting any time stirring things up at the Canberra Times. When our newest media mogul bought a $115m media business he promised to pay some much needed attention to the 160 regional and rural mastheads once owned by Fairfax Media and then sold to him by Nine. First the Canberra Times announced it was putting up a paywall and now the capital city paper has decided to restore its federal political bureau in Parliament House. The Canberra Times, which has a proud history of covering the public service, moved out of Parliament House in 2012 and took its federal political coverage largely from the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age. Former Canberra Times editor Michelle Grattan, who now writes for the Conversation, welcomed the move. \u201cI am delighted that the Canberra Times is re-establishing an independent federal political team,\u201d Grattan said. \u201cThis will be good for the paper and the local Canberra community, and for diversity in the media voices covering national politics.\u201d Jones a turn-off It\u2019s not always well received when ABC news invites Alan Jones on Q&amp;A as a panelist but for many viewers Jones\u2019s being honoured by Aunty with a portrait on Anh Do\u2019s Brush With Fame was a bridge too far. Commenters said they\u2019d give it a miss when it was teased on social media, and it looks like many did give it a wide berth. Ratings reports say there was an average of 544,000 viewers of the program on Wednesday night. But when Anh Do painted cricketer Michael Clarke a few weeks ago, it was the most-watched non-news show of the night with 625,000 metro viewers. Latham on the BBC The BBC also chose to invite a divisive figure to appear on a prestigious program when it chose One Nation\u2019s NSW leader, Mark Latham, to take part in a Global Questions debate panel on Thursday. Latham sat alongside the Liberal senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, Greens MP Jenny Leong, and comedian and broadcaster\u200e Sami Shah to discuss the question, Is Multiculturalism Failing?\u200e We can\u2019t think of a more inappropriate person to ask than Latham. Just last month the former Labor leader said Wollongong risked becoming \u201cthe Bangkok of the south\u201d due to immigration levels. Prue who? Last year the Australian Communications and Media Authority found Sunrise breached broadcasting standards for accuracy and provoked serious contempt on the basis of race when it aired an all-white panel discussing the adoption of Indigenous children and child abuse. The legal fallout from that ugly episode is still before the courts. The segment, hosted by Samantha Armytage with commentators Prue MacSween and Ben Davis, contained strong negative generalisations about Indigenous people as a group. A group of Indigenous people from the remote community of Yirrkala is suing the Seven network for defamation. A request this week by Channel Seven for the federal court to strike out all aspects of the lawsuit have failed, according to a report by BuzzFeed. Justice Steven Rares said all the issues could and should be argued at trial and had some choice words about Prue MacSween, who argued that Indigenous kids should be adopted by white families: \u201cTo me she\u2019s a nobody. I\u2019ve never heard of her and I\u2019ve got no idea what contribution she possibly could have made to the program,\u201d Rares said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
