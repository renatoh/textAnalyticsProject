Most of them are stark naked, but for their traditional pareo skirts. Even in the late 1890s, when Gauguin was there, many Tahitians would have worn full western dress. And they all look very sad and serious, which doesn't ring true \u2013 I've always found Tahitians to be incredibly welcoming and smiley. Gauguin doesn't really put across the physical beauty of the islands, either. You don't really get a sense of the scenery's scale in his paintings. His use of colour, however, is fantastic \u2013 the bright blues and greens are just right. Colour is the first thing that strikes you when you arrive in Tahiti: I remember stopping my car, on my first trip, just to admire the dark green hills. Flowers are present in several of the paintings \u2013 behind a model's ear, or in her hair. That's very accurate: Tahitians are obsessed with flowers, and always give you a \"lai\", or flower-garland, as soon as you get off the boat. They use them as signals: if you put a flower behind your left ear, above your heart, it means you're attached; behind your right ear, it means you're available. Gauguin definitely understood \"mana\" \u2013 the Tahitian word for the islands' special spiritual vibe. Today, Tahiti is still an incredibly spiritual place. One island woman who hosts our tourists at her home will take you out into the garden after dinner, lie you down and get you to look up at the stars, and then tell you stories about which gods came from which constellation. Gauguin's paintings, and this wonderful exhibition, might do a lot to encourage people to visit Tahiti and the rest of Polynesia \u2013 there are special Gauguin tours of the Marquesas, where he died. But believe me, if I could bottle that \"mana\", we'd have people flocking to Tahiti in their thousands."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
