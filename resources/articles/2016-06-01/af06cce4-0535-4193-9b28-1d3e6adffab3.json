The 2005 movie, The Island, imagined one in which those who could afford it sponsored a clone that could be harvested for spare body parts if and when the need arose. People have been prophesying nightmarish scenarios about genetic technologies ever since the publication of Aldous Huxley\u2019s dystopic Brave New World. It\u2019s now 20 years since Dolly the Sheep was cloned and 13 years since the first human genome was sequenced. The fact that none of these scenarios has yet come to pass could prompt the conclusion that they were overhyped. Indeed, the more we learn about the human genome, the less likely it seems that an elite race of \u201csuperhumans\u201d will arise. We\u2019ve learned that complex traits such as intelligence seem to arise from an elaborate interplay of nature and nurture, which scientists are still struggling to unpick. And humanity continues to be riddled with genetic mistakes that cause disease. But radical changes are afoot. The past five years have seen a revolution in our ability to alter our genomes and those of other organisms. Whereas early forms of genetic engineering relied on viruses to insert new genes, a relatively inefficient and haphazard process, the development of a technique called CRISPR has made gene editing cheaper, quicker and far more accurate than before. Since the method was first published in 2012, CRISPR has swept through the scientific community. On Wednesday, the US National Academy of Sciences published a report on the transformative potential of one such application: genetic engineering technology called gene drive. Mosquitoes are currently being engineered with \u201cgene drives\u201d that could render female offspring sterile and potentially wipe species of mosquitoes off the planet . The technology could also be used to eliminate invasive species such as Japanese knotweed or to reverse herbicide resistance and make agriculture more productive. Until now, such efforts have been stymied because in changing an organism\u2019s DNA, you are reducing its ability to survive and reproduce, meaning the changes are eventually weeded out by natural selection. Gene drives overcome this by ensuring the changes are passed to all offspring. The technology could irreversibly alter entire ecosystems. Another potential application of CRISPR is growing human organs in pigs to meet the demand from transplant recipients. Already, genetically altered pig embryos have been injected with human cells, which it is hoped will develop into pancreases that could be transplanted into humans without the risk of rejection by the immune system. Meanwhile, the cost and speed of sequencing an entire human genome is reducing from around \u00a37m in 2007 to less than \u00a31,000 today. Together with advances in stem cell reprogramming that could ultimately see eggs and sperm being created from skin cells, the prospect of designer babies is fast becoming a reality. In his new book The End of Sex, Henry Greely, a professor of law and genetics at Stanford University, predicts that in 20-40 years a majority of babies will be born as a result of IVF, after being screened to ensure they are the healthiest embryos their parents could create. Such is the breakneck speed of progress in these fields that efforts to address the ethical and safety concerns they raise are floundering in their wake. The truth is we don\u2019t know what the consequences of wiping an entire species of mosquito off the planet will be. It could be entirely beneficial. Or it could leave predators without prey or plants without pollinators. Neither are we certain of the consequences of human gene editing. Could we become less tolerant of people with disabilities? Would we end up with an even more unequal society: one of genetic haves and have-nots? Improved regulatory oversight of these technologies is needed. This is beginning to happen. Wednesday\u2019s NAS report endorsed continued research into gene drive technologies, but cautioned that it was too soon to see them released. In September, meanwhile, a global network of stem cell researchers, bioethicists and policy experts known as the Hinxton Group released a statement that research involving human genome editing is essential to gain a basic understanding of the biology of human embryos, although it doesn\u2019t currently believe gene-edited babies should be born. But decisions about these technologies are too important to be left to scientists. Because the implications of these technologies are so vast, the public needs a voice. Open debate about complex scientific issues is possible and the recent public consultation on three-parent embryos and mitochondrial donation is a good example. It hasn\u2019t yet happened with these other technologies, ones that arguably could change the world in more profound ways. Regardless of how we regulate these technologies within our own borders, research elsewhere will continue unless we bring foreign scientists along with us. Inevitably, countries at the cutting edge of this research, including the UK, will shoulder a disproportionate burden of responsibility for shaping these debates and bringing regulatory proposals to the table. As global efforts to combat climate change reveal, it is difficult, but possible, to achieve international consensus and implement measures to address issues that affect us all. However, there is a key difference between genetics and climate change. The beliefs and actions of a single rogue individual may have little impact on the world\u2019s climate, but CRISPR\u2019s low cost and relative ease of use could render it attractive to those intent on harm. Indeed, in February the US director of national intelligence, James Clapper, announced that gene editing had been added to a list of threats that could be used as \u201cweapons of mass destruction and proliferation\u201d. Yet we mustn\u2019t lose sight of the fantastic opportunities these new biotechnologies create. Between 1-2% of babies are born with a genetic disease, while far more of us succumb to early suffering through inherited cancers and dementia. Add to that the thousands of people awaiting organ transplants. It\u2019s unrealistic to think that gene editing will rid the world of every last disease. Viruses and bacteria are nothing if not adaptable. Even so, the likelihood is that humans will be fitter, happier and more productive in the not too distant future. Technologies with the power to radically alter our biology are already here. They\u2019re going to get cheaper, more powerful and more readily available. We need a public debate. Rather than fear such developments, we should engage with them. It\u2019s time to discuss how we might change this world for the better.
