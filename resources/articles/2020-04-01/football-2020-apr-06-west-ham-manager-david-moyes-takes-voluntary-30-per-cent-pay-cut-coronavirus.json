Moyes is the third Premier League manager known to have agreed a wage reduction, after Bournemouth\u2019s Eddie Howe and Brighton\u2019s Graham Potter. The move comes as talks continue at top-flight clubs, also involving the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association, with a view to reducing player wages at a time when income streams have dried up. West Ham have not furloughed any staff and plan to inject at least \u00a330m into the club by launching a rights issue. Gerrard says Rangers decision to defer pay was \u2018no-brainer\u2019 The Rangers manager Steven Gerrard has spoken of his pride after a \u201cunanimous\u201d decision among his coaches and players to defer wages. The club has revealed the first-team squad had volunteered to temporarily forego a portion of their wages for three months, in order to protect non-playing staff. Rangers will also use the government\u2019s job retention scheme to ensure employees receive their full wages. Rangers\u2019 players and coaching staff are reported to be taking only half of their salaries for three months but will be reimbursed once football resumes following the suspension amid the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cThe players and the directors and staff have shown good leadership and responsibility to defer the wages,\u201d Gerrard said via Twitter. \u201cI think it was a no-brainer and the right thing to do. \u201cIt\u2019s important that you show respect to all the people at the club whatever your role is ... I\u2019m very proud of the efforts and the support of everyone at the club. It was unanimous that everyone wanted to do this,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s important during these hard times that no-one suffers from financial hardship. It does make me really proud as a manager that everyone was really keen to make sure that everyone was looked after.\u201d PA"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
