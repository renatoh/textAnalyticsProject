Opera functions on so many levels and through so many expressive elements that, when it works, it is simply overwhelming; music, story, acting, staging, movement, scenery, lighting, each make their own contribution. Of course, precisely because so many elements are involved, it is very hard to get it right, and when it goes wrong, it can go horribly wrong. At this moment in its history, opera is a director's playground and theatrical elements sometimes overwhelm (or underwhelm) the event. Any suspicion, though, that opera might have become an elitist or a moribund form is given the lie on a daily basis. In any great city, the opera house will be as much a forum for confrontation with the present, the past and the future as any theatre, cinema or television channel. Wagner's own temple to himself, the annual festival in Bayreuth, is no longer simply a shrine to his genius; it has become the place where Germany wrestles publicly with its demons. Wagner's works are so quintessentially German and so bound up with the country's recent history that they provide a perfect subject for self-examination. It is easy, in a sense, for opera to bend existing works for the purposes of interpretation or exploration, but in the past decade or two, composers have thrillingly taken the great leap into the present. Anna Nicole, the story of the doomed Playboy model, at the Royal Opera House, and Two Boys, English National Opera's tale of a chatroom murder, could only have been written now, at this moment in time; the musical and theatrical vocabulary is accessible to anyone alive today. Famously, though, opera started as an engagement with the past: the musicians of the 16th-century Florentine Camerata were trying to recreate ancient Greek tragedy, which they mistakenly thought had been sung. So opera begins with words, and with myth. It quickly succumbed to all kinds of influences, theatrical (commedia dell'arte, for example) and musical (the exotic harmonies and instrumentation of Eastern music, say); with the rise of professional singers, composers were irresistibly drawn to an exploration of the extreme possibilities of the human voice. After its austere beginnings (the composers of the Camerata were committed to using only one note per word of the libretto), it became all-inclusive and all-embracing, aspiring to that totality of expression that Wagner insisted on. But opera was an expensive activity, and only got more so as orchestras and choruses expanded in size. The court theatres for which the first operas were written often boasted remarkable, state-of-the-art stage equipment; the spectacular scene changes and coups de th\u00e9\u00e2tre of baroque theatre became embedded in the medium. Audiences came expecting to be astonished; nothing less would do. When opera expanded from court theatres and became part of the world of commercial theatre, scenic fantasia and vocal athletics ruled at the expense of musical or dramatic values. But these commercial enterprises were all ultimately doomed. No one ever made any money out of opera. Vast fortunes invested by besotted billionaires have been lost; Sir Thomas Beecham's finances were so pulverised by overindulgence of his passion for the medium that he had to take three years off conducting to put them in order again. Nearly 200 years earlier, Vivaldi's disastrous attempts at opera management resulted in his being unceremoniously dumped into the same paupers' grave in Vienna that was to receive Mozart's body a few decades later. But, despite its inherent difficulties, opera is irrepressible. It is one of the greatest, most versatile art forms ever created, and once sampled, addiction is common. I was 15 when I saw my first: Il Trittico, Puccini's great triple bill of one-act operas, at the Royal Opera House. I paid 12s/6d for my ticket in the slips and was overwhelmed \u2013 not just by the dramatic power of the music, the richness of the orchestral playing, the beauty of the singing and the spectacular impact of the production, all of which I had expected \u2013 but by the greatness of the acting, which I had not. The leading singer was Tito Gobbi, in two out of the three pieces. His piercing pain and comic bravura were as fine as any acted performance in any medium I've ever seen. Today Jonas Kaufmann and Natalie Dessay and Thomas Allen are every bit his equal. It is not for nothing that opera is thriving. Just look around you: in 2011 you can see opera in pubs, operas in stately homes, operas in prisons, operas in the street, operas at the cinema, operas on ocean-going liners, operas in concert-halls, operas, not least, in opera houses. It can at its best combine the physical excitement of a rock concert, the drama of a great play, the instrumental beauty of the greatest concert at the Royal Festival Hall, the urgency and relevance of the Ten O'Clock News, the physical splendour of great architecture, the intellectual challenge of great philosophy, the glamour of a Hollywood opening. It's a hard thing to pull off. It is the most demanding art form known to man and the one given the least chance of succeeding: vastly complicated shows are given no previews, rehearsals are frequently inadequate, a handful of divas and divos still swan in at the last moment. But the messianic passion of the people who produce opera \u2013 driven not by money, but by a conviction that opera well done is the best time you can ever have \u2013 means that despite every obstacle, it will never die. It has truly never been more alive.
