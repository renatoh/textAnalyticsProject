Shorts were banned as an answer to hot weather. So a dozen drivers came up with a sartorially correct solution \u2013 skirts. Many other cultures had the same idea long ago. If you want garments to reflect the heat and allow air to circulate around the body, about the last thing you need are jeans, chinos or trousers. Shorts are casual wear and, with oversized pockets, logos, and loops, not things that ooze authority. But why stop at skirts? A variety of names are used for the same ankle-length robe with long sleeves throughout the Arabian Gulf and north Africa, where summer temperatures regularly top 40 degrees and above \u2013 the thobe, dishdasha, kandura, khameez or suriyah. Further east, in India, it becomes the dhoti. In southeast asia, wraps such as the lungi or sarong are worn. Whatever it's called, its cooler than trousers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
