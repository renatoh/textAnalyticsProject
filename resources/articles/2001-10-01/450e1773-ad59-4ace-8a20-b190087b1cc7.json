The review, to be announced by the defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, at the Labour party conference today, is an implicit acknowledgement that Britain's armed forces, although highly experienced in anti-terrorist warfare in Northern Ireland, maybe insufficiently mobile and flexible to take account of what is being described as \"a new kind of war\" in far-flung places. Mr Hoon's announcement will come shortly before the conference is addressed by the prime minister, who will say that the ultimatum to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan to hand over Osama bin Laden has expired. \"They had their chance to surrender the terrorist, they chose not to,\" Tony Blair will say. He will promise that military strikes against both Bin Laden and the Taliban - \"their troops, supplies and hardware\" - will be proportionate and targeted. In a significant step last night the US began circulating diplomatic cables to its allies outlining the evidence that Bin Laden's al-Qaida organisation was responsible for the attacks on New York and Washington - a move seen by some diplomats as an essential precursor to military retaliation. Cables were sent to Britain, Canada, and Australia, and will be followed today and tomorrow by dispatches to other US allies around the world. FBI investigators believe that they have uncovered the \"smoking gun\" implicating Bin Laden in the attacks, which killed more than 5,700 people, by uncovering the financial trail left by the hijackers and their accomplices. A central figure in money transfers leading up to the attacks was Mustafa Mohamed Ahmad, a senior Bin Laden lieutenant. The CNN news channel quoted state department officials as saying that President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan would be given an \"eyeball to eyeball\" account of the evidence in a meeting with the US ambassador to Islamabad, Wendy Chamberlin. The Ministry of Defence review is certain to study whether Britain has sufficient special forces - often lightly armed but highly motivated - and if their equipment is relevant to combat what is described by defence specialists as the \"asymmetrical threat of terrorism\". It will also take a fundamental look at the nature of the potential terrorist threat, including how governments can combine their massively superior military weapons, technology and deployments to hit relatively small targets. A defence official said: \"We have thought about terrorism before, but the scale of what happened on September 11 makes it necessary to undertake a re-examination.\" The official admitted: \"We never envisaged there would be so many terrorists willing to lose their lives, attack a major civilian target, and operate in such a coordinated way. A very small cell of people can have a massive disproportionate effect.\" The review will concentrate on issues such as the configuration of rapid reaction forces, methods of attacking quasi-state terror groups, and the way in which terrorists can target the most vulnerable points of society. It will also study the ability of terrorists to undermine public morale, and the implications of their willingness to take casualties, often the result of religious belief. The possible responses in the event of terrorists gaining access to weapons of mass destruction will also be examined. The review is described by officials as \"a new chapter rather than a rewrite\" of the strategic defence review conducted three years ago by George Robertson, now Nato general secretary. At the Labour conference today Mr Blair is to predict that good can come out of the evil of September 11 if the world makes a reality of inter- dependence, fosters greater understanding between different faiths and nations, and tackles the poverty and injustice that feed fanaticism. The prime minister's insistence on his lifelong belief in community as a force for good at home and abroad will contrast with his warning to anxious delegates that the dangers of inaction in face of the terrorist challenge outweigh the dangers inherent in the promised counter-strike. \"Any military action will be proportionate and targeted. We will do what we humanely can to avoid civilian casualties,\" he is expected to say. The outcome of the terrorism review may not be published, and will not focus on intelligence or domestic civil contingencies, already studied by the Cabinet Office. Ministers are still concerned that the supportive state of public opinion could swing around if there were many casualties in any action. Some would like to widen the coalition focus on Bin Laden to his most senior allies so that, if he is not captured, the mission, including the destruction of his camps, would not be seen as a failure. They believe the Taliban are inextricably intertwined with the Bin Laden network."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
