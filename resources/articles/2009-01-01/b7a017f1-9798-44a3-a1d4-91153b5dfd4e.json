The runaway world No1 revealed that last Friday he snapped beyond repair the cue with which he won his third world title last spring and said it was \"not a happy atmosphere\" around tournaments. He did, though, enjoy breaking his cue. \"It was fun. I really went to town on it,\" he said. \"I wanted an excuse not to play. After I'd done it, I thought: is this wise?I love the game but I don't really care whether I play or not. I don't want to feel like that for the rest of my life.\" Dispirited by the atmosphere he now experiences at tournaments, he added: \"I think it [the circuit] should be privatised. It needs someone like Barry Hearn, someone more up-to-date in the modern world.With the people running snooker now, it seems to be going backwards. There isn't the buzz there used to be. It's only the BBC holding it together. It's dying unless something happens.. This isn't the tournament it was when Benson &amp; Hedges were sponsoring it. It's not so much fun.It needs Barry Hearn to come in and do with it what he's done for darts.\" Hearn's promotion of the Professional Darts Council circuit now boasts a prize fund of \u00a35m and has long since overtaken the British Darts Organisation's World Championship in prestige and credibility. Hearn's promotion of snooker's Premier League, which O'Sullivan has won five times in succession, has also been extremely successful. O'Sullivan's complaint about the atmosphere at tournaments is shared to the extent that it is rare to hear backstage any warm words from players for the WPBSA. However, this never seems to translate into coordinated protest. The WPBSA board was recently re-elected en bloc with 67.6% of players with voting rights abstaining. O'Sullivan expects to be fined by the governing body after he impulsively conceded at 0-23 in the 12th frame with nine reds left. Accustomed to playing matches with a fixed start time, he was irritated when an overrun of the previous match caused his second session to start late and his frustration boiled over at that point. \"If they need the money, they can have it,\" he said of a prospective fine. Having had only one hour's practice with his replacement cue, O'Sullivan did well to win at all yesterday, although Perry had a gilt-edged chance to do so when leading 5\u20134 and 48\u201325 before missing a simple pink with the remaining balls invitingly situated. O'Sullivan cleared with 40, made 42 early in the decider and, with Perry missing another easy pink with a chance to get back into contention, was not seriously troubled thereafter. For all his malaise, O'Sullivan was \"pleased to get through. It's the Masters after all.\" In break-making positions he was remarkably fluent with his new cue, making runs of 100 to level at 2-2, 68 to poach the fifth frame from 0-63 and 118 to lead 4-3 after Perry had accounted for the sixth with 105. O'Sullivan's long potting, though, was extremely unreliable. \"There were lots of shots where I didn't know what was going on,\" he admitted. However, there was no sign of the self-destructive impulse which contributed to his 9-5 defeat by Perry in last month's UK Championship after leading 5-2."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
