The Daily Mail takes it even further, saying Johnson is not only thundering toward, but in fact has \u201cOne foot in Number 10\u201d. The paper, which calls him \u201cBulldozer Boris\u201d, says that Johnson\u2019s 114 votes is more than his three closest rivals combined, \u201csuggesting,\u201d says the paper, \u201cMr Johnson\u2019s bid to finally reach No 10 may be unstoppable\u201d. The FT calls Johnson the \u201crunaway favourite\u201d for the job and highlights the fact that after Andrea Leadsom and Esther McVey were knocked out of the race, the field is all-male. The Telegraph reports calls from Johnson\u2019s supporters that contenders who only just passed the threshold of 17 votes \u2013 whom the paper calls \u201cvanity candidates\u201d \u2013 to pull out of the race. The paper speculates that Matthew Hancock\u2019s 20 supporters might switch allegiance to Sajid Javid, and that some of Michael Gove\u2019s supporters may switch allegiance to Johnson because Gove\u2019s campaign \u201cwas in trouble after he came a distant third\u201d. The i says: \u201cJohnson\u2019s Tory enemies regroup after big win\u201d but is less confident about the certainty of victory, saying \u201cHe faces challenge of overcoming curse of Tory favourite\u201d. Several papers focus on the fact that Johnson has not agreed to participate in debates against other Tory candidates. It is the lead in the Times, which accuses Johnson of \u201cholding out\u201d and \u201chiding\u201d. The Sun has pictures of some of Johnson\u2019s opponents under a speech bubble saying: \u201cWe\u2019ve all been screwed by Boris\u201d. The paper predicted Johnson was \u201con the way to No10 last night after nailing his rivals in the race to replace Theresa May\u201d. The Guardian\u2019s lead story is about the US blaming Iran for attacks in the Gulf, but has a story about the leadership contest, saying \u201ccandidates were in talks last night about joining forces to provide the strongest challenge to Boris Johnson, who looks all but certain to be Britain\u2019s next prime minister after trouncing rivals in the first MPs\u2019 ballot.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
