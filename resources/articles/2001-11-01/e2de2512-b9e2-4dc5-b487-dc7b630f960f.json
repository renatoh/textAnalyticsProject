The Leeds United midfielder said he had been \"tipsy\" on the night of the attack in January last year after drinking up to eight glasses of wine to celebrate his birthday eight days earlier. The 24-year-old said he had been looking for Jonathan Woodgate to go to the bar after his team-mate had left a Leeds night club. Woodgate, Bowyer and two other men are accused of attacking university student Sarfraz Najeib, who was kicked, punched and bitten. They deny the charges. Bowyer told a jury at Hull Crown Court that he had earlier sent a mobile phone text message to his girlfriend Michelle saying he was in Leeds on a night out but had not told her where he was planning to go later. \"She would have killed me,\" he said. Bowyer said he suffered a bruised face and grazed knuckles when he fell as he jogged through Leeds city centre looking for Woodgate, who he thought was returning to the DV8 bar, where he had been earlier in the evening. The prosecution claim that Bowyer was involved in the attack on Najeib, who was chased from outside the Majestyk night club following a fracas with a group of youths. Bowyer said he was picking himself up after falling, when he saw a group of young men returning from Mill Hill, where the attack had taken place. He claimed that he had tripped as he ran because he was not looking where he was going and after falling, he was \"whacked or kicked\" from behind and was pushed to the ground again. \"I have no idea who did it. When I got up I was still feeling dizzy and DV8 was the last thing on my mind,\" he said. Bowyer said he then saw Woodgate coming round the corner from the direction of Mill Hill. \"I crossed the road to join him and when I got to him a group of people came running out of Mill Hill,\" he said, denying he had been in Mill Hill at any stage that night. Bowyer told the court that he had been drinking wine with Leeds team mates Harry Kewell and Michael Bridges. He had later gone to a Leeds pub and then the Majestyk night club, where he drank more wine and a spirit drink. He denied he was drunk however. \"Drunk is when you can't walk and can't see,\" he told the jury. The trial continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
