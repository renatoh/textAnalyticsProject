Users rely on search to find what they want among the teeming masses of pages. Recently, however, people have begun using search engines as answer engines to directly access what they want -- often without truly engaging with the websites that provide (and pay for) the services.\" Free search is fine, of course, if it sends you visitors, but Jakob argues that \"paid search confiscates too much of a website's value\". The solution is, he says, to keep visitors coming back to your site without them clicking on expensive ads."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
