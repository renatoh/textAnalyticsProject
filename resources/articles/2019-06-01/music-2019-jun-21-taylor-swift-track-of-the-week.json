Of course he does. And being Adam Green, he has used this setup to record his own new album. Of course he has. Sad and windswept, an aide-m\u00e9moire to an imagined past, you could easily imagine that, yes, it is 1971 for ever; somewhere Gainsbourg is still potting the Chateau Lafite, and \u201cfatty liver disease\u201d just means an obsession with foie gras. Mabel Mad Love What is this thing now where female pop stars keep asking: \u201cTell me can you hit it right?\u201d Hit what, exactly? If Mabel\u2019s lyrics feel like they\u2019ve been heavily workshopped to ride the line between teen-pleasing filth and daytime radio play, they are no worse off for it. The PVC cladding may be more Ann Summers than Berghain, the production best described as \u201cSpotify\u201d, but with a quiet-loud dynamic tighter than a duck\u2019s designer vagina, it\u2019s a hit. Pharrell Williams Letter to My Godfather It\u2019s strange to think that Pharrell was the mind responsible for both Drop It Like It\u2019s Hot and Happy, like if Jonas Salk had also patented pneumatic baby-maiming shears. An acoustic guitar ballad that relies heavily on AutoTune for any kind of differentiation, his titular letter is neither genius nor war crime. I could see it being a huge hit. I could see it disappearing tomorrow. You just never know, with the state of the general public these days. Bat for Lashes Kids in the Dark In chillwave no one ever dies, they just become a more washed-out, Kodachromed, tie-dyed facsimile of themselves. Natasha Khan, who \u2013 if memory serves \u2013 used to write rich, diaphanous pop songs of the kind engineered to appeal to the Mercury prize judges, seems more of a Xerox of a Xerox. What was once witchy enchantment now resembles M83 playing in the next room. A shoo-in for Drive 2. Taylor Swift You Need to Calm Down This is being touted as her LGBTQIA+ anthem, but I still can\u2019t shake the sense Taylor is secretly working for the Republicans. Put simply, seldom has homosexuality sounded quite so orthodox and tedious. \u201cSunshine on the street at the parade / But you would rather be in the Dark Ages \u2026 / Cos shade never made anybody less gay\u201d. This isn\u2019t a gay anthem, it\u2019s an anthem for people who pick up and put down the term \u201cally\u201d like a Michael Kors bag."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
