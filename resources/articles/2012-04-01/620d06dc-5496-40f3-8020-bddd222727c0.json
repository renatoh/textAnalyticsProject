Redford will be at the opening night gig with T Bone Burnett, and introducing a documentary on that indie-est of subjects, Prince Charles. You also get 14 highlights from Sundance proper, including time-travel romcom Safety Not Guaranteed and college drama Liberal Arts, plus prize-winning documentaries The House I Live In and The Queen Of Versailles. The O2, SE10, Thu to 29 Apr Sensoria, Sheffield Film and music come together in mysterious and moving ways here, in a rare festival that's equal parts both. So you get some \"straight\" live music (if the experimentalism of Laurie Anderson can be described as such), and a variety of music-related movies, whether it's those with great scores (such as Zbigniew Preisner's The Double Life Of Veronique) or British pop stars, as with Performance (plus Q&amp;A with producer Sandy Lieberson). And some events split more down the middle, such as live soundtracks of diverse genres to Japanese horror Onibaba, Fritz Lang's Metropolis and Lon Chaney's Hunchback Of Notre Dame, among others, or a day of short works by audiovisual performers. Various venues, to 29 Apr Oxdox, Oxford This year marks 10 years of bringing horizon-broadening documentaries to a town where the horizon was already pretty broad, and the festival is now pretty substantial \u2013 even if many of the films here have been on release elsewhere. Still, many bases are covered, particularly politics, art and music. The latter offers the world premiere of Northern Sounds, an overview of Scandinavian contemporary music, plus docs on 1980s punk survivor Bob Forrest (Bob And The Monster) and the fruitful local indie scene. Things kick off with apocalyptic doc Four Horsemen at the Oxford Union, followed by a panel discussion that will be beamed to other cinemas. Various venues, Fri to 24 May London Film Museum Covent Garden's former Flower Cellars have become a dramatic new exhibition space for the south bank Movieum \u2013 with a crisp monochrome interior that complements the opening exhibition nicely. Magnum On Set rounds up some of the best behind-the-scenes photos ever taken, as a result of close links between eminent photographers in the collective, such as Robert Capa and Eve Arnold, and sympathetic directors including John Huston and Billy Wilder. The 146 images on show document landmark movies such as The Seven Year Itch, Planet Of The Apes and Rebel Without A Cause, alongside Charlie Chaplin's Limelight and Antonioni's Zabriskie Point. And if that all feels a bit too low-tech, you can always tour the exhibition with one of the museum's iPads and its interactive app. 45 Wellington Street, WC2, from Sat"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
