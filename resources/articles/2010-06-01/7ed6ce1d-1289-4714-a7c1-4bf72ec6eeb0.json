Tries from the flanker Andy Saull, the full-back Nick Abendanon, No8 Luke Narraway and Varndell, all converted by the fly-half Stephen Myler, put the Saxons in a dominant position. But Russia, who have qualified for next year's World Cup, battled bravely and three penalties from Yury Kushnarev and a well-taken try from wing Vasily Artemiev saw them trail 28-14 at the break. The fly-half Kushnarev added another penalty for the Russians but further tries from Varndell, Micky Young and Stephen Myler, who ended with 19 points to his name, completed a comfortable victory."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
