Trump\u2019s claim, delivered in a White House press release, came in a week that has seen days of record new infections, daily deaths running at almost 1,000 a day, and a 23% increase in cases. As the US president prepared to return to the key battleground state of Florida for a rally in Tampa on Thursday, Trump and his campaign continued to pursue its tactic of minimising a pandemic that has claimed at least 226,000 lives and continues to rage in many parts of the country. While Democrat Joe Biden entered the final week of campaigning with a nine percentage point lead in national polls, the margin in key battleground states \u2013 including Florida and Pennsylvania \u2013 remained closer. In some hotly contested states, turnout for early voting was even higher than the national figure, including Florida, where the equivalent of two-thirds of those who voted in 2016 have voted. In Texas \u2013 which the influential Cook Political Report on Wednesday moved from \u201clean Republican\u201d to a \u201ctoss-up\u201d between Biden and Trump \u2013 the figure was 87%. Democratic luminaries in the state, such as former presidential candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke, have been begging Biden to make a visit there in the closing days. The campaign is offering the vice-presidential nominee, Kamala Harris, instead, who will visit Fort Worth, Houston and the border city of McAllen on Friday. But it was the coronavirus pandemic that continued to dominate the agenda. Asked about Trump\u2019s claim to have \u201cended it\u201d, even the White House communications director, Alyssa Farah, struggled to defend the assertion. \u201cI think that was poorly worded,\u201d Farah told Fox news. \u201cThe intent was to say that it is our goal to end the virus. But what I would say is this, because of the president\u2019s leadership, we are rounding the corner on the virus.\u201d Trump has repeatedly claimed that the coverage of coronavirus has been weaponised and exaggerated by the media to damage his chances of re-election. \u201cCovid, Covid, Covid is the unified chant of the Fake News Lamestream Media,\u201d Trump tweeted on Wednesday. \u201cThey will talk about nothing else until November 4th., when the Election will be (hopefully!) over. Then the talk will be how low the death rate is, plenty of hospital rooms, &amp; many tests of young people.\u201d Trump was seemingly nettled by a mocking speech delivered by Barack Obama in Florida on Tuesday, following a similar venting about Covid coverage from the president at a rally last weekend. \u201cWhat\u2019s his closing argument? That people are too focused on Covid. He said this at one of his rallies: \u2018Covid, Covid, Covid,\u2019 he\u2019s complaining. He\u2019s jealous of Covid\u2019s media coverage,\u201d Obama said. Biden aimed for a far more realistic tone, in a speech in Wilmington, Delaware. \u201cEven if I win, it\u2019s going to take a lot of hard work to end this pandemic,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not running on the false promises of being able to end this pandemic by flipping a switch. But I do promise this: we will start on day one doing the right things.\u201d He said Trump\u2019s attitude towards the pandemic was \u201cinsulting\u201d to the families all across America who are suffering. Biden has said that he will listen to the science and the first person he will call if he\u2019s elected will be Dr Anthony Fauci, the top public health expert on the White House coronavirus taskforce, who has served presidents since 1984 but whom Trump has recently called an idiot. On Wednesday Fauci warned in a virtual interview for Melbourne University that although he is confident a successful vaccine will be here within a few months, normal life may not be restored for Americans until late 2021 or even 2022. In the last week of the campaign, the dynamics of the electoral college \u2013 which Trump won in 2016 despite losing the popular vote to Hillary Clinton \u2013 appeared to be defining the campaigning schedules of the two candidates. With Trump focusing on midwestern states he needs to hold to stay in office, Biden was planning to visit Iowa later in the week \u2013 a state Trump carried by 10 points in 2016. Of particular concern has been polling in Pennsylvania, where Biden\u2019s current lead in a state that is key for both candidates is just 5.1 points \u2013 leading some to suggest that if polling errors seen in 2016 were replicated, the state might be close to a tie Commenting on the tightening Pennsylvania race, Nate Silver of the FiveThirtyEight polling website underlined its importance. \u201cIt is close to being a must-win for Trump, who has only a 2% chance of winning the electoral college if he loses Pennsylvania. Biden, however, has a bit more margin for error.\u201d The Biden campaign, meanwhile, announced that the candidate and Obama will campaign together at the weekend for the first time, in the battleground of Michigan. Also, late in the day the US supreme court rejected a last-ditch Republican effort to stop mail-in ballots being counted in Pennsylvania after election day. And the identity of Anonymous, a Trump official who claimed there was a \u201ca quiet resistance\u201d within the administration working to save America in a 2018 New York Times op-ed, was revealed as Republican Miles Taylor, a former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security. The penning of the article, and a subsequent book on the same theme, sparked a slew of media coverage and wild Washington speculation as to the identity of the author. It also angered Donald Trump and many of his top officials, who launched a frantic and unsuccessful hunt for the mole throughout the White House staff and beyond. Predictably, Trump attacked him on Twitter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
