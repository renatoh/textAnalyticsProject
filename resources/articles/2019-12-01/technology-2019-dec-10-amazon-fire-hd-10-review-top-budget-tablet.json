Now in their ninth-generation, Amazon\u2019s Fire tablets follow a tried and trusted formula: undercut the competition on price with a good enough screen, good enough performance and Amazon\u2019s version of Android, Fire OS, wrapped in a robust plastic body. The \u00a3150 2019 Fire HD 10 doesn\u2019t break the mould. In fact, side by side with the previous version released in 2017, the only things that separate them are a USB-C socket instead of the old microUSB for power and a new paint job (now available in subtler black, twilight blue, plum and white rather than bold primary colours). At 9.8mm thin, 504g in weight and 262mm long, the Fire HD 10 is fairly easy to hold on a couch or pack for the commute. A range of own-brand cases can put a cover over the screen that folds into an effective kickstand. The plastic is hard wearing and while there\u2019s some flex in the body, it feels like it can take a bit of rough and tumble just fine. The full HD 10.1in screen has a 16:10 ratio that\u2019s perfectly suited to watching video, meaning you get a bigger picture than you would on a similarly sized 10in screen with a squarer 4:3 ratio (such as an iPad). It won\u2019t beat the screen on a top-end tablet, but the LCD display is crisp and bright enough with wide viewing angles to make the most of sharing movies and TV shows indoors. Stereo speakers in the top are fairly loud and clear, but lack bass and sound a little shrill when turned up to maximum. There\u2019s a headphone socket or Bluetooth for connecting your own headphones. Specifications Screen: 10.1in 1920x1200 LCD (224ppi) Processor: 2GHz octa-core RAM: 2GB Storage: 32 or 64GB plus microSD card slot Operating system: Fire OS 7 based on Android 9 Camera: 2MP rear and front-facing cameras Connectivity: Wi-Fi ac, Bluetooth, USB-C Dimensions: 262 x 159 x 9.8 mm Weight: 504g Good battery, good enough performance The Fire HD 10 gets a much-needed speed boost for 2019. Amazon says it\u2019s 30% faster than the previous version, which doesn\u2019t make it lightning fast but it feels a lot more responsive in operation. Swiping around the system, loading and jumping between apps is all fairly smooth, if not quite rapid. The response to your touch feels quicker too, while video apps handle just as well as much more powerful tablets, scrubbing through video with ease. Searching the web in Amazon\u2019s Silk browser can be a little slow, as can loading large games. It can get a bit bogged down if you try to do much as it\u2019s installing apps in the background. But if all you want to do is a bit of light browsing, accessing the odd email and binge-watching your favourite shows on Amazon, Netflix, Sky or BBC iPlayer, the Fire HD 10 is perfectly serviceable. Battery life is a solid 11 or so hours, longer if you\u2019re watching video locally rather than streaming. It is easily enough to see me through four movies or an entire TV series. New for this year is the addition of USB-C. With the included 9W charger the Fire HD 10 takes four hours to fully charge. With something more powerful it\u2019s closer to three hours from dead \u2013 best done overnight. Fire OS 7 The Fire HD 10 ships running a new, updated version of Amazon\u2019s Android version called Fire OS 7, now based on the much more recent Android 9 rather than the older Android 7. Not that the interface has changed much. It\u2019s still based on a carousel you swipe through, with a customised \u201cfor you\u201d screen that predicts what you want to do, such as continue that movie you were part way through, or use a recently opened app. There\u2019s a more traditional app home screen too, which you can customise with folders, as well as one for books, video, games, shopping, music, audiobooks and a newsstand. It works well enough. New for Fire OS 7 is picture-in-picture so you can keep watching videos while you do other things. The big difference between Amazon\u2019s Fire OS and regular Android is the lack of the Google Play Store and Google\u2019s various apps and services. Amazon\u2019s App Store has most of the media consumption apps you\u2019re likely to want, including Spotify, BBC iPlayer, ITV Hub, All 4, Netflix and Sky Go, and it has a fairly large range of games. But, BT Sport, YouTube, Google Maps, Google Photos, Chrome and anything made by Apple are a no-go. You also need an Amazon account to use it, and a Prime subscription giving access to Amazon Prime Video to make the most out of the tablet. Observations Some apps such as Sky Go or BBC iPlayer refuse to load videos and other content onto a microSD card, meaning you\u2019re stuck using the limited 32 or 64GB of storage Hands-free Alexa is available and it can be used to control video playback including scrubbing Amazon\u2019s older Fire HD 10 cases fit the new one The cameras are mediocre, but good enough for the most basic of photos or video chat in good lighting The Fire HD 10 isn\u2019t encrypted out of the box \u2013 I recommend turning it on in settings with a passcode Price The ninth-generation Amazon Fire HD 10 costs \u00a3149.99 for 32GB or \u00a3179.99 for 64GB of storage \u2013 but you will have to look at ads (dubbed \u201cspecial offers\u201d) on the lockscreen. It costs \u00a310 to remove the ads. For comparison, Amazon\u2019s Fire 7 costs \u00a350, Fire HD 8 costs \u00a380 and Apple\u2019s iPad costs \u00a3349. Verdict The new Amazon Fire HD 10 does just enough to stay at the top of the bigger-screen budget tablet pack. It\u2019s more responsive. It\u2019s durable. The 10.1in widescreen is crisp and bright enough to make watching movies and TV shows indoors a good experience. The wide viewing angles and fairly loud and clear speakers make it easy to share with others. It won\u2019t compete for screen quality with Apple\u2019s iPad Pro, but then it\u2019s one fifth the price. If what you\u2019re after is a media-consumption tablet \u2013 which let\u2019s face it is what most people do with even their top-end tablets \u2013 then in many ways the Fire HD 10 is all the tablet you\u2019ll need. Just don\u2019t expect it to have blistering performance, and be prepared to swim in Amazon\u2019s ecosystem with its own App Store and no Google services. If you don\u2019t need the 10in screen the \u00a380 Fire HD 8 is a better buy, but you will struggle to find anything from a known brand that\u2019s even remotely as good as the 2019 Fire HD 10 for anywhere near \u00a3150. Pros: good screen, solid battery life, good speakers, microSD card slot, USB-C charging, headphone socket, feels durable, reasonable performance, good Alexa integration, most of the apps you need, good value Cons: rubbish cameras, slow charging, no Google Play, some apps lacking from Amazon App Store, Silk browser isn\u2019t that great Other reviews Amazon Fire 7 tablet review: still a lot of tablet for just \u00a350 Amazon Fire HD 8 tablet review: still the best tablet for \u00a380 Apple 12.9in iPad Pro review: bringing back the wow factor Google Pixel Slate review: a strong case for death of Android tablets"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
