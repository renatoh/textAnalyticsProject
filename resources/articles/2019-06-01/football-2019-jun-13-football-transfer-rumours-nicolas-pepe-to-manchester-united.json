The winger hasn\u2019t scored in three months, with Ed Woodward unwilling to spend top dollar on a player that turns 30 in July. Having signed Bale\u2019s compatriot Daniel James, United are thought to favour a different transfer policy to years past with a focus on younger players. Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9 fits the mould, with the 22-year-old leading Lille to a second-place finish and Champions League qualification last season. Left-footed, the Ivorian plays off the right wing \u2013 a position that United need to fill. One player who could be leaving Old Trafford is Romelu Lukaku, who is doing his upmost to catch the eye of Antonio Conte, Inter\u2019s new manager. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see Conte has joined Inter. For me he is the best manager in the world,\u201d said the Belgian. \u201cI\u2019ve already taken a decision about the future but I can\u2019t reveal it because I have a contract with Manchester United and because I respect the club. I am a big Serie A fan, those close to me know that I have always wanted to play in the English league and in the Italian one, I love Italy. The club and my agent will talk about it but I have already made my decision.\u201d Jeez, talk about laying it on thick. Antoine Griezmann\u2019s future is still up in the air with Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s chief executive Gil Mar\u00edn claiming that the Frenchman is off to Barcelona, but the player himself clueless. \u201cI want my future to be decided more than anyone, but there\u2019s a need to wait,\u201d Griezmann said after France\u2019s win over Andorra on Tuesday. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll remain in Spain. Maybe in two weeks we\u2019ll know something.\u201d Tune into the Rumour Mill in a fortnight, then, readers! Mo Salah\u2019s best mate, Dejan Lovren, is apparently a target for Milan, who are pondering Liverpool\u2019s \u00a325m asking price. Liverpool could well use that money to buy Porto striker Moussa Marega, who scored 18 goals last season and would be signed as back-up for Bobby Firmino. Say that three times fast. Ayoze P\u00e9rez has started talking about Newcastle in the past tense, with reported interest from Valencia, Sevilla, Napoli and Inter. \u201cI cannot thank Newcastle \u2013 the city, the club, everything around \u2013 for what they have given me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been five unbelievable years, ups and downs, unforgettable moments, bad moments, but it\u2019s part of the process that made me a better footballer and person. Obviously, it\u2019s always going to be in my heart, whatever happens.\u201d North of the wall, Celtic are continuing their tried-and-tested strategy of hoovering up all the talent in Scotland, most of which will sit warm the bench next season. Welcome David Turnbull! The 19-year-old Motherwell man was the Scottish Football Writers\u2019 young player of the year after scoring 15 goals from midfield last season. Celtic are also casting their net slightly further afield in a bid to catch Toulouse defender Christopher Jullien, who is absolutely massive at 6ft 4in and would cost around \u00a38m."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
