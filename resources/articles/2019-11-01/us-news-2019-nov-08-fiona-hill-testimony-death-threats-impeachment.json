Fiona Hill, who was the senior director for Europe and Russia in the National Security Council (NSC) said other NSC staff had been \u201chounded out\u201d by threats against them, including antisemitic smears linking them to the liberal financier and philanthropist, George Soros, a hate figure on the far right. In her testimony to Congress, a full transcript of which was released on Friday, Hill described a climate of fear among administration staff. The UK-born academic and biographer of Vladimir Putin said that the former ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, was the target of a hate campaign, with the aim of driving her from her post in Kyiv, where she was seen as an obstacle to some corrupt business interests. Yovanovitch was recalled from Ukraine in May on Trump\u2019s orders. In a 25 July conversation with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Trump described Yovanovitch as \u201cbad news\u201d and predicted she was \u201cgoing to go through some things\u201d. The former ambassador has testified she felt threatened by the remarks. Trump\u2019s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, led calls for Yovanovitch\u2019s dismissal, as did two of Giuliani business associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman. All three are under scrutiny in hearings being held by House committees looking at Trump\u2019s use of his office to put pressure on the Ukrainian government to investigate his political opponents. \u201cThere was no basis for her removal,\u201d Hill testified. \u201cThe accusations against her had no merit whatsoever. This was a mishmash of conspiracy theories that\u2026I believe firmly to be baseless, an idea of an association between her and George Soros.\u201d \u201cI had had accusations similar to this being made against me as well,\u201d Hill testified. \u201cMy entire first year of my tenure at the National Security Council was filled with hateful calls, conspiracy theories, which has started again, frankly, as it\u2019s been announced that I\u2019ve been giving this deposition, accusing me of being a Soros mole in the White House, of colluding with all kinds of enemies of the president, and of various improprieties.\u201d She added that the former national security adviser, HR McMaster \u201cand many other members of staff were targeted as well, and many people were hounded out of the National Security Council because they became frightened about their own security.\u201d \u201cI received, I just have to tell you, death threats, calls at my home. My neighbours reported somebody coming and hammering on my door,\u201d Hill said, adding that she had also been targeted by obscene phone calls. \u201cNow, I\u2019m not easily intimidated, but that made me mad.\u201d \u201cWhen I saw this happening to Ambassador Yovanovitch, I was furious,\u201d she said, pointing to \u201cthis whipping up of what is frankly an antisemitic conspiracy theory about George Soros to basically target nonpartisan career officials, and also some political appointees as well.\u201d In Yovanovitch\u2019s case, Hill said: \u201cthe most obvious explanation [for the smear campaign] seemed to be business dealings of individuals who wanted to improve their investment positions inside of Ukraine itself, and also to deflect away from the findings of not just the Mueller report on Russian interference but what\u2019s also been confirmed by your own Senate report, and what I know myself to be true as a former intelligence analyst and somebody who has been working on Russia for more than 30 years.\u201d Hill dismissed the suggestion that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election was a \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d intended to distract attention from Russia\u2019s well-documented role. The treatment of Yovanovitch, Hill said \u201chad a really devastating effect on the morale of all of the teams that I work with across the interagency because everybody knows Ambassador Yovanovitch to be the best of the best in terms of a nonpartisan career official. The former national security official, who resigned in July, said she thought that the fact that Yovanovitch was a woman in a high position also played a role in the attacks. \u201cI don\u2019t see always a lot of prominent women in these positions \u2013 she was the highest ranking woman diplomat,\u201d Hill said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
