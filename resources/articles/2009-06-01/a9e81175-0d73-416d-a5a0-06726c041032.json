The first payment to Nationwide was returned and Lloyds cancelled the standing order. Lloyds now says she must get a reference number from Nationwide because it is a building society and not a bank, otherwise she will have to give me a cheque each month. Nationwide says my Flexaccount is a bank account and the sort code and account number are all Lloyds needs. All I want is my money. PB, Portsmouth When your mother organised the standing order mandate, two numbers in the sort code were transposed and that stopped the April payment going through. Lloyds confirms that it does require a reference number for standing orders which are set up to send money to building society savings accounts, but not when money is going to current accounts. Staff at the branch should have known this. The bank has sent your mother a partially completed standing order form to fill in and a cheque for \u00a325 to apologise. \u2022 Email Margaret Dibben at your.problems@observer.co.uk or write to Margaret Dibben, Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU and include a telephone number.
