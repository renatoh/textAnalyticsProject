Then because of the way results went it needed to be sorted out in 48 hours and it was sorted out in 48 hours, because I was available and ready. If you look at my track record why wouldn\u2019t I be here, irrespective of Marco Silva? I have every respect for him and I am not criticising him, but Marco Silva\u2019s track record has got no comparison whatsoever with mine because he got Hull City relegated.\u201d That might sound a little harsh, given that Silva won things before he came to this country and Allardyce is one of several English managers who keeps gaining employment despite never having been among the prizes, though the new man at Everton is clearly keen to underline the fact that he has never been relegated from the Premier League. Considering some of the situations Allardyce has been sent to sort out that is quite an achievement, as is being hired by seven Premier League clubs, though he does not view his present post as a typical case for Fireman Sam. \u201cI do have a reputation as a firefighter; it is why I am here and not sunning myself in Dubai,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this is a club with ambition, a club that wants to qualify for Europe and reach cup finals. It would be very nice to get away from that firefighting label and start to look at moving back to the top half of the table.\u201d Allardyce has signed an 18-month contract \u2013 his apparent U-turn over the Everton job was seemingly because the club initially wanted him just until the end of the season \u2013 but is hopeful he will get the chance to make more of what he describes as his best club opportunity since Newcastle in 2007. \u201cYou have to have a contract for legal and employment reasons, but everyone knows in football they are meaningless,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you do well you get your contract extended, if things go badly you get the sack. Not many clubs get rid of a manager who is taking them in the right direction, so that\u2019s what you have to try to do.\u201d Everton took an enormous step in the right direction under their own steam with the 4-0 result against West Ham on Wednesday. Allardyce was at the game, and enthused by the points gained and the three-goal contribution from the midfield convert Wayne Rooney. \u201cWithout that win [but a defeat] I would be sitting here now in charge of a bottom-three club,\u201d he said. \u201cAs it is we have a bit of breathing space. This is new for me, I must admit. I\u2019m not used to going into clubs that have more points than games played, and Everton now have 15 points from 14 games. \u201cPerhaps the most pleasing aspect of the win was the clean sheet, because it was only the second of the season [in the league] and it was accomplished with the only four defenders we had fit, though of course I could not fail to be impressed by Wayne\u2019s performance. It was a bit like watching the old Wayne Rooney at Manchester United. He set a very high standard for himself with that performance and he put the idea that he can\u2019t play in midfield to bed once and for all.\u201d Allardyce, who has brought Sammy Lee to Everton and expects to have Craig Shakespeare on the staff by the time Saturday\u2019s game against Huddersfield kicks off, will probably continue to use Rooney in midfield, but sparingly. \u201cPlayers who are moving into their mid-30s have to accept \u2013 and generally they don\u2019t because they all think they are still 24 or 25 \u2013 that if we can give them a rest we will,\u201d the manager explained. \u201cWe all get too old in the end, and you have to make sure with more senior players that the load does not become too much. \u201cWayne is never going to lose his ability or his intelligence, but to produce his best he needs the energy to do it. Maybe that fantastic performance the other night was precisely because he had been left out of a couple of games. You have to have enough energy to perform at your best level.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
