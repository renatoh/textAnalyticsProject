Its history was chequered from the outset: it was by no means a failure as some have claimed, but the first production in 1891 was so costly that it bankrupted London's new Royal English Opera House (now the Palace theatre), and few have dared perform it since. Nowadays, the stumbling block is likely to be Julian Sturgis's libretto, which is a mix of pre-Raphaelite blank verse and quasi-medieval demotic (\"Whither away, Sir Sluggard? Hola!\" and so on). Despite Sullivan's professed distrust of Wagnerian nationalism, Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg and Lohengrin are the score's principal models, though there are also big Verdian duets for Ivanhoe and Rowena, and Rebecca and Brian de Bois-Guilbert. The recording, conducted with love and commitment by David Lloyd-Jones, was the brainchild of the late Richard Hickox, to whom it is dedicated. Toby Spence is an impeccable Ivanhoe opposite Janice Watson's aristocratic, if effortful Rowena. But it's Geraldine McGreevy and James Rutherford, astonishing as Rebecca and Brian, who will really sweep you away."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
