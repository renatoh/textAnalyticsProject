Eleven hundred hours, at the arrow on the map, which turns out to be in the south-east corner of Hyde Park, London, at the huntress fountain. It may not be the Costa Rican rainforest, but the squawking of urban parakeets passing overhead helps. And the goddess Diana shooting her arrow is fitting. Further fauna: a rat scuttles out from under a shrub, in search of lunch. Has it been planted there by Bear, I wonder? Will it be my lunch, boiled in my own urine? Where is he, and how will he arrive? From the air probably, dangling from a rope ladder; I\u2019m listening for the sound of whirling rotor blades. Or perhaps he will jetski across the Serpentine\u2026 Disappointingly, Grylls just strolls over casually, bearing takeaway cappuccinos. If indeed this is Bear Grylls, wearing a baseball cap and sporting a tache. Did he grow it for Movember? Actually, he says, he was just filming in Fiji, stopped shaving and grew \u201ca bit of rough\u201d. But then he had a Royal Marines dinner last week. \u201cI thought, \u2018I can\u2019t turn up in full mess kit with \u2026\u2019 like you,\u201d he says, pointing at my own bit of rough. \u201cSo I shaved the rest of it off and kept the moustache.\u201d The baseball cap is so he can walk around town unbothered. (It seems to work: he goes largely unnoticed sitting on a bench, and it\u2019s only when the cap comes off for photos that people stop and point and get their phones out.) He has just walked from his houseboat on the Thames. Bear, his wife, Shara, and boys \u2013 Jesse, Huckleberry and Marmaduke \u2013 also have a small island in north Wales and a home in Switzerland. To escape to the mountains, or to escape from HMRC? \u201cNo, it\u2019s certainly not about getting away from British tax. I\u2019m a proud, proud British taxpayer,\u201d he says. Yeah, I\u2019m going in hard. I learned it from his new book. How to Stay Alive: The Ultimate Survival Guide for Any Situation, in the How To Handle Yourself In a Fight chapter. \u201cRemember: you never win a defensive fight. Strike first, strike hard.\u201d And never give up. NEVER. He remains mostly good-humoured, only occasionally sighing at my questions. He also has an alarming habit of asking his own, trying to turn the tables. \u201cLook, you\u2019re as scruffy as me,\u201d he points out. \u201cCan you get away with that in the office? What do your kids say? \u2018Dad, get a grip?\u2019 How old are your kids?\u201d No, Bear. How old are yours? (Answer: 16, 13 and 10, while Bear himself is 45.) This isn\u2019t about me, it\u2019s about you. And surviving. At which point the rat appears again. \u201cI\u2019ve eaten a lot of rats in my time \u2013 they are not as bad as you might imagine,\u201d he says. \u201cI think the last one was with Prime Minister Modi \u2026 no, the last rat I ate was with David Walliams.\u201d Exactly, I think: he puts his celebrity guests through hell, so he can take a bit back. I\u2019ve learned other things from the book, too, about preparation, not getting sidetracked. I\u2019ve picked my subjects and my questions, and I\u2019m sticking to them. Grilling Bear. Rat or squirrel? Actually this wasn\u2019t a prepared question, but a squirrel has just appeared, so I wonder whether the former SAS man would go for this or the rat if he had to live off the land. And the answer is: squirrel. It\u2019s bigger and easier to catch. \u201cYou could literally sit down, be quiet, put some crumbs at your feet, then stand on it. In the wild you\u2019ve got to be a bit more savvy.\u201d Surviving in Hyde Park, in some kind of nightmare post-Brexit Armageddon perhaps, would be a piece of cake, he says. As well as the rats, squirrels, pigeons and ducks, there\u2019s water, and trees to build a shelter with. And if a dog attacked? Formidable hunters (I don\u2019t think he\u2019s talking about that bichon frise over there), he agrees, but he has tips. \u201cDon\u2019t make eye contact \u2013 that\u2019s a threat. Don\u2019t smile, because that\u2019s showing your teeth. Turn sideways to protect your vital organs. Don\u2019t run because they are chase animals\u2026\u201d Suddenly, he\u2019s up off the bench, acting it out, wrapping a coat around his arm to offer the dog because it\u2019s better to be bitten on the arm than the neck. With the other hand he would be looking for something, even if it was just a phone or his bare hands. \u201cBAM! Really aggressive, really hard, straight to the eye socket to blind it, and into the brain,\u201d he says, jabbing at the imaginary canine. In a second he\u2019s gone from good-natured and mild-mannered, if occasionally a little exasperated, to Bear Grylls from the telly, the caricature, the brand, undeniably successful, but faintly ridiculous. Who actually needs it, though? All this survival stuff, who is it for? Knowing how to deal with a dog attack might be useful but I can\u2019t see how lots of it fits in with my life. Will I even remember, next time I\u2019m swimming with sharks and in need of a poo, to grab my faeces as they come out and hurl them towards the horizon? Or how to land a helicopter in an emergency? It\u2019s a loo book, he says, a little bit of information regularly going in. You don\u2019t have to know it all, \u201cbut it is empowering for both men and women to know how to look after themselves in certain situations. Do you know how to deal with a tsunami and understand what to do if you\u2019re in a car during an earthquake? Don\u2019t stop by pylons, pylons fall down: little things like that.\u201d Remember that, next time you\u2019re in an earthquake, in a car: no parking by pylons. Was he born in the wrong time? He should have been a Victorian explorer, no? \u201cNo. The more civilised we get, the greater the wanderlust and adventure spirit inside. You can\u2019t stamp out 100,000 years of DNA survival in two generations.\u201d He tells me about the Hollywood stars on Running Wild who have told him how good and natural it has felt to sit staring into a fire not saying very much. And a big tough rugby player who people think is a man\u2019s man, but who is embarrassed because he doesn\u2019t know how to tie something to his car\u2019s roof rack. Macho can-do masculinity \u2013 that\u2019s what it\u2019s about, isn\u2019t it? \u201cIt\u2019s about can-do life,\u201d he says. And he\u2019s not going to feed me a headline about modern masculinity, he adds. \u201cI\u2019ve done things on The Island with just men and just women; I\u2019ve taken out Hollywood celebrities. It\u2019s not about gender, it\u2019s about in here\u201d \u2013 he points to his head \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s about skills and resilience, and always about attitude.\u201d And it transfers over into normal life, he says, because survival is about attitude, positivity, resourcefulness, kindness, courage, determination \u2026 \u201cThose things apply whether you are in an earthquake here, or you\u2019re a single mum bringing up kids in Tennessee, fighting a few battles there or a scout helping in a refugee camp in Syria. The qualities and values are the same, \u2013 all that\u2019s different is the terrain.\u201d What did Eton teach him? \u201cI\u2019m not going talk about it \u2013 let\u2019s not go there.\u201d But he did go there. And he does talk about it \u2013 a bit. What did he learn? \u201cI think first of all I learned fear, which isn\u2019t a good emotion. I really missed home and my parents \u2013 it was an age where you were sent off to boarding school and didn\u2019t see them for months.\u201d He is grateful for the friends he made, though. And that he survived, \u201cthrough the fear, through the fight and trying to stay afloat, because I spent a lot of time madly flapping, trying to stay above water and not always succeeding\u201d. Academically? \u201cIn everything. I was not a superhero at school. I think through that I developed resilience and a little bit of backbone. All these sporting and academic and good-looking heroes left as heroes, but five years later they scratched their heads and thought: \u2018Hold on \u2013 I thought life was going to be easy.\u2019 Their effort muscles inside were pretty weak even though their outer muscles were pretty strong. I was the opposite: my outer muscles might not have been brilliant, I didn\u2019t have the A-grades and trophies, but inside I spent so much time swimming like a ninja, I was pretty resilient.\u201d Any more calls from the White House? Grylls ran wild in Alaska with Barack Obama towards the end of Obama\u2019s presidency. They shared a salmon carcass, they talked about flatulence and stared into the fire together. Has the incumbent rung to book in a wild weekend? \u201cNo, but we did reach out when he was president-elect and he said no, he was busy.\u201d How would Trump be in the wild? \u201cYou know, everyone is different. I think Obama especially liked being out of his comfort zone and was curious. A lot of people when they get to positions of power like to stay in their comfort zone. They like to be the main guy, they like to be in charge. I think Trump is more that character: he\u2019s not the sort of person to say: \u2018Tell me what I do here\u2019, where Obama was like that.\u201d Johnson v Corbyn, in the wild: who wins? \u201cYou cannot judge a book by its cover \u2013 you never know until you are in it. You could look for indicators \u2013 not physical, it\u2019s all about attitude. So you could possibly say: from what I\u2019ve seen in the newspapers, somebody is potentially more positive and determined, and maybe that person \u2026 I\u2019m not saying who I think is more positive.\u201d Nor will he tell me who he\u2019s going to vote for. \u201cAs chief scout\u201d \u2013 he\u2019s been in the role since 2009 \u2013 \u201cI would never tell you my political persuasions.\u201d What about that frog? I ask him about the controversy over the frog he killed and ate while filming in Bulgaria. \u201cOh my God, you\u2019re unbelievable. If you write a crappy headline, I\u2019ll come round and set the dogs on you.\u201d But a) I don\u2019t write the headlines and b) no problem because he\u2019s just told me how to survive a dog attack. I\u2019ll jab them through their eye sockets into their brains. What about the frog, though? What happened? \u201cFound a frog, killed frog, ate frog.\u201d A rare frog. \u201cIt was certainly not a rare species of frog. I could see thousands of frogs; it was totally permitted as well. It was a classic bit of fake news. I have eaten a lot of frogs over the years \u2013 speak to the French.\u201d Speaking of fake news, what about the time in 2007 when he made out he was sleeping in the wild for the series Born Survivor, when he actually spent some nights in a hotel? \u201cWow, you really are digging. What, do you want to sit here for half an hour and go through every bit of bad press? I just think if you want to influence nobody positively, have no criticism in life, do nothing \u2026 If I didn\u2019t want any criticism I wouldn\u2019t ever do anything.\u201d There\u2019s a bit in the book about how to hotwire a car, in a survival situation, obviously. But it could be used in other situations. Bear Grylls encourages criminality: what do you say about that? \u201cYou know what? At this point I say: \u2018Go fuck yourself,\u2019\u201d he says, laughing. Just. Who are his heroes? The Scarlet Pimpernel, Robin Hood, George Mallory, Tarzan, John the Baptist \u2026 John the Baptist? \u201cI\u2019d say No 1. Never went to church, but loved Christ, lived in the wild, loved locusts and honey, cared about people.\u201d Does God help you survive? \u201cYeah, unashamedly. I see it in relationships, and in my children, I see it in nature, I see it in great things, quiet kindnesses, in little gestures, I see the beauty of God when I see someone who is caring with their grandmother with dementia. Look at the Scouts: there are now 22,000 scouts in this country \u2013 our Dementia Friends \u2013 every week going into senior citizens\u2019 homes holding hands with dementia patients.\u201d Why do the Scouts matter? More passing fauna, not wild: a procession of well-groomed horses ridden by men in dressy uniform. \u201cIsn\u2019t it beautiful? Lifeguards \u2013 wonderful. Look at that \u2013 service.\u201d The Scouts are all about service, he says. \u201cIn 1907, Baden-Powell said: \u2018I want to bring people from different backgrounds, I want to give them a common set of values and experiences of adventure and send them out into the world to make a difference in their communities.\u2019 It is now the biggest youth organisation on the planet, 50 million strong, growing faster than ever before.\u201d He is dead proud of being chief scout, tells me I should sign my children up. \u201cBut more importantly, you should volunteer because then it\u2019s something you are doing with your kids. You are teaching them how to write, or how to interview someone, how to dress like a tramp, hahaha.\u201d He wears a Scouts wristband on his right hand, along with ones for the Royal Marines and the SAS Regimental Association, and a bracelet given to him by a nice Berber lady in the Sahara. On his left wrist he\u2019s wearing a Bear Grylls Luminox watch, out next year, inscribed Never Give Up. Will he ever give up? \u201cI hope not,\u201d he says, then tells me a story about trying to persuade his 18-year-old nephew to stop smoking. \u201cI said: \u2018Maybe it\u2019s time to ease back on the smokes.\u2019 And he goes: \u2018You\u2019ve always told me, ever since I was a baby, never to give up\u2019. At which point I held my head in my hands and go: \u2018I love you.\u2019\u201d There you go, another headline: Bear Grylls encourages children to smoke. \u201cI knew it was a bad idea doing an interview with the Guardian,\u201d he says. I still get a hug. \u2022 How to Stay Alive: The Ultimate Survival Guide for Any Situation by Bear Grylls is published by Corgi (\u00a38.99).
