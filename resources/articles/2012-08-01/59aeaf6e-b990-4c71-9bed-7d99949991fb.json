Niang, a 17-year-old who has made two appearances for France Under-21s, has been subject of a failed \u00a35m bid from Arsenal and has also been linked with Manchester City, Tottenham Hotspur and Milan. The teenager trained with Arsenal for a week this summer but, with the Gunners' initial offer rejected by Caen, Spurs and now Everton hope to capitalise with a \u00a36m deal. The Goodison Park club banked an initial \u00a312m from City for Jack Rodwell on Monday, although the fee could rise beyond \u00a315m depending on club and personal achievements. David Moyes will have the bulk of the \u00a312m to reinvest and wants to add a striker and right-sided midfielder to his squad. Niang, who can also operate out wide, will meet Moyes and visit Everton's Finch Farm training ground over the coming days as he ponders several career options. The Everton manager has also enquired about Clint Dempsey but is unlikely to pursue the Fulham forward, who is in the final 12 months of his contract at Craven Cottage and a target for Brendan Rodgers at Liverpool."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
