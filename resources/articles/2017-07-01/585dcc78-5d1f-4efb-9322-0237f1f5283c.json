Although the Chelsea winger does not turn 30 until next month, the European Championship is her eighth major tournament and she can remember a time when the Lionesses felt, if not out of place, a little uncomfortable in elite company. \u201cI think there\u2019s a bit of an aura about this team now,\u201d said the creator of England\u2019s fifth goal \u2013 scored by Jordan Nobbs \u2013 in Wednesday\u2019s 6-0 humiliation of Group D rivals Scotland. \u201cGermany have had it for years and the United States have it but it\u2019s what England have lacked going into major tournaments for the last 10 years.\u201d Now the days of almost apologising for their presence at the top table are definitely over. \u201cWe have a different mentality,\u201d Carney said. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t we be confident going into games? We\u2019ve got some excellent players.\u201d Such luminaries include Jodie Taylor, the Arsenal striker whose brilliant hat-trick crushed Scotland, Nobbs and Lucy Bronze, yet Mark Sampson\u2019s squad seem formidably strong in all positions as they approach a potentially tricky game against fast-improving Spain \u2013 who beat Portugal 2-0 on Wednesday \u2013 in Breda on Sunday night. \u201cSpain are a top team but we\u2019ve got to be confident,\u201d Carney said. \u201cThere\u2019s a fine line between confidence and arrogance but we want to come home from Holland with the gold medal; that\u2019s what this is all about. We\u2019re going to pay the opposition respect but, if we play to the best of our ability, we believe we can win.\u201d The memory of Hope Powell\u2019s England losing to Spain during a calamitous European Championship four years ago seems unlikely to spook Sampson\u2019s class of 2017. \u201cIn 2013 we were in a very different place,\u201d Carney said. \u201cWe\u2019re fitter, faster and stronger now. Our game has moved on domestically and we\u2019re all full-time professionals. We\u2019re a different team with a different mentality. Spain like to play their tiki-taka football but Mark\u2019s done his homework and the great thing about us is that we can play multiple styles of football. We\u2019ll push Spain.\u201d After representing England in seven consecutive tournaments \u2013 and playing for GB in the 2012 Olympics \u2013 few players can offer better context and perspective than Carney. \u201cMy first major championships was in 2005, which makes me feel ancient. I\u2019m really proud of playing in all the tournaments, yet I can have all the caps in the world but there\u2019s no point if you don\u2019t have a gold medal. I\u2019d rather have one gold medal and 10 caps than 200 caps and no gold. It\u2019s all about winning \u2013 and that\u2019s what this team intends to do.\u201d A key characteristic of England\u2019s progress is Sampson\u2019s emphasis on the all-important human factor. \u201cI think we\u2019re enjoying it more because we not only have a great team but we also really care about each other,\u201d Carney said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been together a long time and we know everybody\u2019s families and partners; it\u2019s nice. We make a big effort to get to know each other and want each other to do well. \u201cBefore coming on against Scotland I was sitting on the bench just buzzing for the girls; for Jodie to get the hat-trick, for Toni [Duggan] to get a goal and for Fran Kirby to just be out there. I\u2019ve spent the last year watching Fran doing rehab exercises [following serious knee trouble] at Chelsea so it was fantastic to see her talent explode against Scotland. We\u2019re a proper team.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
