And there has been no wilder card than Ivanisevic. After his historic 7-6, 7-5, 3-6, 7-6 win, the Croatian leapt along the back of the court like an escaped animal, hurled his shirt into the crowd, stood laughingly on a chair and flexed his bare chest in two directions, drinking in the crowd's rapture as though tasting it for the first time. Ivanisevic, indeed, played like a man reborn. But there were also moments near the end when he convulsed with anger at a line decision to collect a warning (\"I used the f-word but it's OK, you know\") and other moments when he played like a clown, three times attempting half-volleys between his legs (\"If you miss it can hurt, you know\"). For all his new-found serenity, these were colourful reminders that this is still the man who too often has so powerfully self-destructed. But rarely did that look like happening yesterday. For two sets Ivanisevic served so smoothly and so accurately, and occasionally so fiercely, that he was virtually unbeatable. For the next set and a half he showed himself capable of conquering his rising tension as Safin, playing the best match of his short grass-court career, steadily recovered his form. Then in the concluding tie-break, as he had in the first, Ivanisevic became unbeatable again, hurling down serves like a man already late for an appointment. \"He's playing the best he has ever played,\" said Safin. \"He doesn't give you any chances. The second serve is also difficult to return. If he plays again like this he will have no trouble winning the title. He can't lose this opportunity.\" Ivanisevic knows only too well that he can lose it, but still agreed. \"I believe this is the year. I thought I was finished and now I can do it,\" he said. Supporting his opinion were 30 aces yesterday, bringing his total to 150 in five matches, though the brilliance of his transformed performance went way beyond his imperious first serve. It was often the second serve which frustrated Safin the more, because it shut him out of the game completely. And the Russian still had his work cut out when he got into rallies with the Croatian, who stroked the ball about patiently. This baselining method was the one by which Safin had to win the majority of his rallies. No matter how carefully he tried to work his serve and volley into things, it too often let him down. In the first-set tie-break he became pinned back behind a modest second serve, leaving room for Ivanisevic to ease his way forward for a winning stop volley. It was a crucial, subtle blow. Safin was again imprisoned behind the baseline near the end of the second set, losing three successive points from there. Then, after trying to break out on the fourth point with a charge to the net, he changed his mind, retreated, and came forward again, only to be flummoxed by an Ivanisevic lob. That cost him his serve and the set, but the 21-year-old improved markedly throughout the third set. His break in the sixth game imposed only the third loss of serve upon Ivanisevic in five matches, and Safin hung on well throughout the serve-dominated fourth set. At the denouement, however, Safin again stayed back once too often, paying the penalty in the shape of a flat forehand winner from Ivanisevic, and then when he plucked up courage to gamble on coming in he was caught by a fizzing topspin shot at his feet. That Ivanisevic was able to play like this after falling to a world ranking in the 120s, where he was obliged to play in second-tier Challenger tournaments, rates as the one of the most startling comebacks in the game's history. It took Jennifer Capriati almost three years to rebuild her game, but Ivanisevic appears to have achieved it by walking through the Wimbledon gates. The low point was in January when he flew for 24 hours to play in the qualifying competition of the Australian Open - and tanked the first match he played. \"It was a humiliation,\" he said. \"I heard people saying 'Why is he doing that? I don't know why he did that.' After that I woke up. And I am awake, very awake, now.\" But without four weeks off before playing at the warm-up tournament at Queen's last month, there would have been no reawakening. His painful shoulder, upon which he has been delaying an operation for two years, was given the longest rest it has had. But will it prove long enough? Yesterday he felt discomfort again after one 132mph serve, which persuaded him to take a painkiller. For a while after that he lost some of the rhythm which is the essence of his action. Later, he said, it was fine again. Even though there may be a doubt in his mind, it has to be said Ivanisevic is still talking as well as he plays. \"To lose now would be a big disappointment,\" he said. \"I have come so far and this is my last chance. I want to go further.\" Tim Henman be warned."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
