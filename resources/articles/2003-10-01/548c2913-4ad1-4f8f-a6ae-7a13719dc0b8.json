Julia Middleton, the chief executive of the leadership development charity, Common Purpose, was appointed to the board of Places for People Group (PfP) by government regulators to improve the way it is run. Speaking for the first time since her appointment, Ms Middleton said that not-for-profit organisations like PfP needed a code of governance similar to the Higgs code produced for the private sector. Following the allegations of poor governance at PfP, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation last week revealed that it is planning a major review of the way public services are held to account. The inquiry, to be chaired by former NHS chief executive Sir Allan Langlands, will aim to set out the role of board members, chief executives and chairmen of charities, housing associations and foundation hospitals. Ms Middleton welcomed the inquiry. \"We need clarity - rules and procedures for appointments and roles,\" she said. She said that she hopes the Langlands inquiry will produce a Higgs-style code in \"non-business language\". The Housing Corporation appointed Ms Middleton last week to strengthen the board of the PfP. It also appointed John Belcher, chief executive of the giant sheltered-housing provider, Anchor Trust. Ms Middleton said she knows little about housing, but has been following the PfP row in the press. \"My brief is that there are significant governance problems [at PfP]. That's something I understand. I'm engaged when there is a problem on a board,\" she said. She was involved in the appointment of the corporation's new chairman, Peter Dixon, as an independent assessor for public appointments made by the office of the deputy prime minister. PfP and Anchor are planning to be among the first housing associations to pay their board members. However, Ms Middleton revealed that she has taken on the role without payment - \"My motivation is the public good,\" she said - and she favours board members continuing to serve on a similar voluntary basis. She noted that former PfP board members, including the Guardian's David Walker and cookery writer Prue Leith, who resigned in protest at poor governance at the group, were volunteers. \"The former board members were talented people who had a great deal to contribute without payment,\" Ms Middleton said. Ms Middleton also said she favoured transparency in the way that organisations are run. Asked whether PfP were right to hold its annual general meeting behind closed doors, she said: \"Langlands should give us the answer. I know what I'm tempted to say, but these are organisations that have to run in real world.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
