The move is intended to pump cash into the banking system and restart the flow of lending to families and businesses. After sterling took a fresh battering on the foreign exchange markets from investors anxious about the escalating cost of the government's bank bailouts, King used a speech to a CBI dinner in Nottingham to promise that the Bank's monetary policy committee is ready to take \"unconventional measures\" to kick-start the economy once its standard weapon of interest rate cuts is exhausted. King said the bankruptcy of Wall Street bank Lehman Brothers in September had plunged the world into \"an unprecedented and synchronised downturn in business and consumer confidence,\" and the UK was now in the grip of \"a pronounced contraction in spending and output.\" With interest rates already slashed to 1.5%, he conceded for the first time that a more radical approach might now be necessary. \"It is sensible for the MPC to prepare for the possibility \u2013 and I stress that we are not there yet \u2013 that it may need to move beyond the conventional instrument of Bank rate and consider a range of unconventional measures,\" he said. These would \"take the form of purchases by the Bank of England of a range of financial assets in order to expand the amount of reserves held by commercial banks and to increase the availability of credit to companies,\" he said. Echoing US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke \u2013 who used a speech in London last week to introduce the term \"credit easing\" as a description of his own approach \u2013 King said that, as well as buying government bonds to recharge banks' balance sheets with cash, the Bank was also urgently drawing up plans to buy particular types of assets whose markets were malfunctioning. \"It will be a matter of weeks, not days, before a programme of purchases can begin, but it will be weeks, not months,\" he said. The Fed has already plunged into several markets in an effort to keep credit flowing \u2013 buying mortgage-backed assets issued by government-backed mortgage guarantors Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as \"commercial paper\", the debt issued by many companies to fund day-to-day operations. As well as setting out the Bank's possible next moves, the governor threw his weight behind Chancellor Alistair Darling's latest rescue package for the financial sector, announced on Monday, describing the measures as being \"designed to protect the economy from the banks\". Eventually, the governor said, the costly taxpayer bailouts for the financial system would start to take effect, and help the economy to recover. \"The banking system is receiving massive support to cope with the need to restructure its balance sheet. That will take time, but time is a great healer, even of banks.\" Part of Darling's package was a \u00a350bn fund for the Bank of England to buy corporate bonds, widely seen by the markets as the first step towards quantitative easing \u2013 but King's more detailed proposals suggest the Bank is ready to go much further. The governor also defended this handling of the economy before and since the onset of the credit crunch, stressing that the Bank had repeatedly warned of the risks of an increasingly complex financial system in the years before the crash, and pointing out that last summer, before the Lehman collapse, inflation was still rising. After Lehman's bankruptcy, however, he said, \"our business contacts at home and abroad, and my international counterparts, started to report that orders and confidence had, in the same telling phrase, 'fallen off a cliff'.\" Some critics, including independent MPC member Professor David Blanchflower, argue that interest rates should have been cut earlier and faster last summer as the deteriorating state of the labour market began to send worrying signals about the wider economy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
