Failure to resolve a new contract for Bowyer has sustained speculation that the midfielder might leave Leeds. But he has now given a public vote of confidence in the club. \"Of course I want to stay,\" he said. \"The support here is great. Where can I get support like I've had here? It's impossible.\" His advisers continue to negotiate with Leeds and he confirmed: \"I know they met on Thursday but they haven't agreed terms yet, but hopefully they will and I'll still be here.\" Bowyer was placed on the transfer list briefly by David O'Leary after refusing to accept disciplinary action earlier this year. But the midfielder backed down and now, after returning from suspension, has been in excellent form, winning the man of the match award in front of Sven-Goran Eriksson in Sunday's win over Sunderland. That match marked Keane's first league goal since September 30, a rare moment of uplift for the striker who has been overshadowed by Mark Viduka, Alan Smith and, in particular, Robbie Fowler. Since Fowler's arrival from Liverpool at the end of November, Keane has started only one match, being relegated, as he was on Sunday, to a substitute's role. But the Republic of Ireland striker is determined to stay at Elland Road despite the frustration of life on the bench and inevitable speculation that he will be sold, with O'Leary under orders to cut back his squad in the summer. \"I love Leeds; it's a good club and I feel at home here,\" said Keane yesterday. \"I've heard the speculation loads of times before. Every club I've been at in the last three or four years, after I've been there about six to eight months, there are rumours I'm going here, there and everywhere. \"But just to clarify, and get everything out of the way, I'm happy at Leeds. I've always said that, and I'm willing to keep fighting for my place.\" The newly crowned First Division champions Manchester City and promotion aspirants Wolves - where Keane started his career - have been linked with the player, who moved to Elland Road from Internazionale for \u00a313m in December 2000. Bolton's manager Sam Allardyce plans another foray into the foreign market with his team virtually assured of another Premiership season. Lazio's Yugoslavia defender Sinisa Mihajlovic, available on a free transfer this summer, is the target after Allardyce narrowly failed to secure him on loan on transfer-deadline day. Allardyce said: \"When a player of Mihajlovic's international quality is available you have to be interested. But we won't know about our chances until the summer months.\" Alan Little has left Halifax after the Conference-bound club released him from his contract as manager. Little, whose contract was due to expire at the end of the season, suffered a burst appendix early last month and the coach Neil Redfearn took over on a caretaker basis. Redfearn continues in charge for the time being. Sean Bean has joined the board of Sheffield United. The Sheffield-born actor is a lifelong United fan and sports a tattoo on his left shoulder proclaiming \"100% Blade\". It is understood Bean is making an undisclosed investment in the club. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
