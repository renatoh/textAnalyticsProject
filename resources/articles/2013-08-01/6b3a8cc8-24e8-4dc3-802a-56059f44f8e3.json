And by jove, it's profitable activity. How profitable? Hard to say for sure because each government department takes care of its own bills, but here's the outflow from the Ministry of Justice. Extrapolating responses to impertinent questions from Labour's shadow justice team, we see that in 2010-11, the Ministry of Justice spent \u00a3578m on a clutch of private sector service providers. The following year it was \u00a3614m. Last year it was \u00a3737m \u2013 10% of the ministry's budget. G4S, Serco, Sodexo, Capita. Shouldn't they all be called Ker-ching? \u2022 Quite the most disarming thing about the coalition is the way it segues from scandal to shambles. The transition is seamless. Every plan designed to self-destruct. Take the trains. At the beginning of last year's west coast franchise fiasco, when ministers were forced to break the news that crappy old First Group was going to be operating the service instead of Virgin, ministers were sent out to tour the news studios placating angry passengers saying that the new train operator would be laying on direct services to Shrewsbury and Blackpool from London. Cue local Tory MPs all happy. Then things went wrong and the new transport secretary stood up in the Commons last December to announce that it was all a bit of a cock-up and Virgin would have the route after all. But don't worry, they said, Virgin will start direct London train services to Shrewsbury and Blackpool! Except it won't, for now the rail regulator rules that there is \"not currently sufficient space\" to do it, and the \"proposals would have a detrimental impact on the journeys of millions of passengers\". It's a blessing that ministers don't drive the trains. \u2022 Always keen to know more about Margaret Thatcher, and to that end, the release of fresh info from the National Archives proves a godsend. We see her annoyance that beloved President Ronald Reagan went ahead with his invasion of Grenada without telling her, and we see more evidence of the extent to which she was wedded to the meritocracy. William Hague she rejected as too young to be a special adviser, but the young Oliver Letwin was a shoo-in. \"You know his parents, Shirley and Bill,\" said his benefactor Sir Keith Joseph. Contrast that with her reaction to Lord Heseltine when he asked for a couple of black special advisers to assist with regeneration policy in the inner cities. OK, she said, but they should only be recruited as volunteers. The blessed Margaret did worry about Britain being swamped by \"an alien culture\". She wouldn't have wanted the aliens cluttering up Whitehall as well. \u2022 Still things have changed since then. Look at Shaun Bailey, the black Tory voluntary worker recruited to bring some knowledge of diversity and the inner city experience to No 10. The PM likes Shaun. But what was it the Sunday Telegraph wrote about him just the other day? \"Shaun Bailey lost his job as a special adviser earlier this year before several former public school pupils were drafted in to senior roles at No\u2009 10.\" Oh well, plus ca change. \u2022 Just one more way in which our lives are improved by academic research. Keele University has been host to \"the 5th Annual Meeting of the Alcohol Hangover Research Group\". Necessary because \"the hangover has been a neglected part of the alcohol research scene until recently\". The meeting builds on the success of the psychology department at Keele. It attracted \u00a3148,975 of funding for alcohol hangover research. But will anyone remember what was said? \u2022 Finally, often uplifting to hear from distant acquaintances, and to that end many of us at the Guardian were happy recipients of what appears to be an email from the blood-curdlers' blood-curdler, the extremist scholar Omar Bakri Mohammad. He was always such a larger-than-life character while he was here; one assumes he has lost none of that vim since being exiled from Britain. He was last seen in Lebanon, from where he continues to curdle. And yet, one hesitates to join with him on Twitter, as he asks. Just not enough hours in the day.
