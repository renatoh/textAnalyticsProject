Following a meeting of state and territory agriculture ministers in Moree in NSW on Tuesday, federal drought minister David Littleproud announced the new working group would be set up and would report back to government in February. The new working group, a partnership between the new National Drought Agency and the National Farmers\u2019 Federation, has been asked to \u201cget rid of inefficiencies and doubling up to improve access for affected farms and communities to recovery programs.\u201d \u201cIt will improve their effectiveness and ensure the right assistance is delivered at the right time, to farmers and communities,\u201d Littleproud said. \u201cWe have a responsibility to ensure that drought assistance is complementary at the different levels of government, and not working against other assistance measures. The move comes after the country\u2019s peak farming group, the National Farmers\u2019 Federation, called for a simplification of Australia\u2019s drought response and greater collaboration between state and federal governments, saying the system was \u201cconfusing\u201d. It also follows remarks from the federal government\u2019s new drought coordinator, former Northern Territory chief minister Shane Stone, who refused to be drawn into the debate over climate change\u2019s impact on the drought, saying he was acting as a \u201cpublic servant\u201d and his opinion was not relevant. \u201cI\u2019m here trying to work through different measures that will help people who are confronting one of the worst droughts on history and you want to line me up and ask me whether I believe in climate change or not,\u201d Stone told ABC radio on Tuesday, suggesting it was a \u201cgotcha question\u201d. He said he believed the \u201cclimate is always changing\u201d and he would also be using his role to look at long-term resilience and adaptability. Speaking ahead of the agricultural ministers\u2019 drought meeting on Tuesday, the NFF president, Fiona Simson, questioned whether the current system was helping affected farmers. \u201cAt the moment for a farmer it is very confusing,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have a myriad of forms to fill in, a mass of different schemes you can apply for [and] they all require a different process. \u201cYou know you are much better off out there feeding your sheep or cattle or doing what you have to do to make sure you have water and fodder for them, but in actual fact you are trying to work your way through a mass of different processes. We have to do it better and have to do it now.\u201d Simson said the farmers\u2019 federation had worked hard with the federal government on its $1.5bn drought response package unveiled last month but that it needed improvement. \u201cThere are a range of things on the table, but are they actually helping the people who need help? How do people access these things? And are there not better ways that we can work together to make sure we can get the assistance out there?\u201d Ahead of Tuesday\u2019s meeting, Littleproud called on the states to radically increase their drought funding, calling for council rate concessions, payroll tax relief and concessions on electricity prices. He singled out Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia for lagging behind other states. \u201cAgriculture is a strategically important industry and we all need to work together to bring farmers through the drought,\u201d Littleproud said. \u201cWe\u2019ve stepped up our response as the drought has stepped up \u2013 we need the states to join us.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s meeting will also be attended by the government\u2019s new drought coordinator, who said there was \u201cno magic bullet\u201d to address the \u201cdevastating\u201d consequences of the drought. \u201cThis is going to be a long, hard grind.\u201d Stone said Tuesday\u2019s meeting would focus on collaboration between federal, state, territory and local governments and the response at a community level. \u201cIt is about simplification \u2013 that is, to make it easier for people to access the support that is on offer, and there is a lot of support. But I do accept that people are a bit put off by the forms and everything else that comes with it,\u201d Stone said. \u201cIt is no good people waiting for weeks and months for things to happen. There is a great sense of urgency and I\u2019m confident that with everyone working in collaboration that we will be able to make a difference.\u201d According to the Bureau of Meteorology, Australia recorded its driest November and spring on record, while for the year to date, the country had its second driest on record, behind 1902. The bureau has also said climate change is exacerbating drought conditions, bushfire intensity and heatwaves, with Australia\u2019s climate having warmed just over 1C since 1910."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
