Dominic Raab, who is backing the frontrunner after being knocked out of the leadership contest, said any motion from MPs against a no-deal Brexit would have \u201czero legal effect\u201d and could be overridden. He also said it would be \u201cthe EU\u2019s fault\u201d if Britain leaves on World Trade Organization terms because it was possible to strike a better Brexit deal before the end of October if there was sufficient political will. In an interview on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Raab argued that leaving the EU without a deal would not be a problem, partly because the general agreement on tariffs and trade (Gatt) could be applied to create a standstill on tariffs with the EU. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, and Liam Fox, the trade secretary, have said it is not possible for the UK to trigger this unilaterally. But Raab said Carney was not a lawyer and claimed that \u201clegally it could be done and the question is whether there is the political will\u201d. He batted away suggestions that parliament would find a way to stop a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, arguing it was necessary to end the \u201cpantomime\u201d over leaving the EU. Raab claimed there would be only a \u201cvanishingly small\u201d number of Conservative MPs willing to vote down their own government to prevent no deal, as they would conclude that the risk of a Jeremy Corbyn government was greater. In a separate interview, Rory Stewart, another former Tory leadership contender, said he would vote with opposition parties to prevent the UK leaving the EU without a deal on 31 October. But he would not go so far as vowing to vote down the government to prevent no deal, as \u201ca dozen or so\u201d Conservative MPs are prepared to do according to the defence minister Tobias Ellwood. Stewart said: \u201cI would definitely vote against a Conservative government to stop a no-deal Brexit. I wouldn\u2019t vote to bring down a Conservative government. I don\u2019t want Jeremy Corbyn to be prime minister. I would be working with colleagues to use the legislative instruments in order to stop a no-deal Brexit.\u201d This month, the Tory MP Oliver Letwin said parliament had run out of options for preventing a no-deal Brexit, after a motion he helped to table aiming to tie the next prime minister\u2019s hands on the issue was defeated by 11 votes. But Stewart, who voted with the government in that vote, insisted parliament had not exhausted all options to prevent no deal. Stewart, who said he was backing Johnson\u2019s opponent, Jeremy Hunt, said: \u201cParliament is against no deal. It is only the legal default because parliament made it the legal default. Parliament can unmake it the legal default. There are many, many opportunities in legislation that have to brought forward, that could be amended in order to stop a no-deal Brexit.\u201d Stewart appeared resigned to accepting that Johnson would become the next prime minister. But he said Johnson would let all his supporters down because he would not be able to stick to his promises. He said: \u201cBoris is pretending that he has a magic solution where he can take people out [of the EU without a deal] and is not going to damage them at all, and it\u2019s going to be terrific. That\u2019s very clever, because it is resonating with people. But the reality is that he can\u2019t do it and he\u2019s going to let people down. \u201cHe\u2019s going to let down the remainers that support him, who somehow think he\u2019s going to finagle it. He\u2019s going to let down the hard Brexiteers because he\u2019s not going to come out on 31 October. The problem is that on 1 November he\u2019s going to end up with a lot of disappointed and frustrated people.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
