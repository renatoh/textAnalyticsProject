They\u2019re on seven points now, two points behind Barca and three ahead of the Bundesliga outfit. If they win in Germany next time out, they\u2019re through to the last 16. A famous City win: Despite enjoying just 41% of the possession to Barca\u2019s 59%, City put Barcelona to the sword courtesy of an Ilkay Gundogan brace and one from Kevin De Bruyne after Lionel Messi had put the visitors ahead. It was a great game of football, so make sure to seek out the highlights if you can - you won\u2019t be disappointed. A worrying number of Barcelona\u2019s second string players seemed out of their depth, with reserve defenders Samuel Umtiti and Sergi Roberto having paerticularly poor games. Let\u2019s not take away from City, mind - they kept Barcelona\u2019s peerless attacking trio fairly quiet and were little short of rampant in a second half in which Barcelona were totally bossed. Peep! Peep! Peeeeeep! Referee Viktor Kassai signals a momentous night in Manchester City\u2019s history with three shrill blasts on his whistle. They\u2019ve finally beaten Barcelona at the fifth time of asking. It was an outstanding performance by Pep Guardiola\u2019s side - with the exception of a shaky spell during the first half, they made Barcelona look very ordinary. 90+2 min: City win a corner off Samuel Umtiti after good work down the right from Aguero. Silva takes it short to the Argentinian as they attempt to run down the clock. 90+1 min: Barca win a free-kick, which is curled towards Leo Messi at the far post. Unmarked in acres of space, he makes a mess of his header when he should have scored. 89 min: Barcelona lump the ball forward in an uncharacteristically agricultural fashion and Luis Suarez is jeered as he makes a pig\u2019s ear of an overhead kick. City\u2019s supporters are loving this. 88 min: Man City substitution: Kevin De Bruyne goes off to a standing ovation and is replaced by Nolito. 86 min: Barcelona keep plugging away, with Neymar, Lucas Digne and Messi combining as they try to pull a goal back. Busquets wins a header that threatens to drop at the feet of Messi in a dangerous position, but Big Willy is quick off his line to snuff out the danger. 85 min: City\u2019s fans are in fine voice as the cheer their team to what looks like certain victory. They\u2019re two goals ahead with only five minutes remaining. What could possibly go wrong, eh? Eh? Oh. 83 min: Barca win yet another corner, but at the third or fourth time of asking, Man City clear at the near post and set off on the counter-attack. Barcelona eventually clear their lines with Busquets whacking the ball out of play. 82 min: Okay, maybe five or six yards. Messi takes it, but the defensive wall blocks. Corner for Barca, which is quickly followed by another one. 81 min: Free-kick for Barcelona just outside the Manchester City penalty area after Otamendi clatters into the back of Luis Suarez. It\u2019s a little left of centre, approximately two yards outside the box. 79 min: A lovely touch from David Silva, who dinks a short pass into the penalty area that allows Aguero to shoot from a very tight angle. It\u2019s just a little bit too tight. 77 min: Barcelona substitution: Rafinha on for Andre Gomes. Meanwhile in Germany, Celtic have equalised against Borussia Moenchengladbach, a state of affairs that leaves City two points behind Barca and three points clear of the Bundesliga side as things stand in Group C. 76 min: Sergio Busquets has been booked for some indiscretion or other. I\u2019m not sure why - possibly for protesting about something or other after City scored. City extend their lead with another fine goal. Kevin De Bruyne plays the ball through the inside right to Navas, who squares it. It hits the back of - I think - Aguero and bounces kindly for Gundogan, who scores his second of the evening from about eight yards. 76 min: Barcelona win a corner, which Neymar swings in from the right. Willy Caballero is quick off his line to punch clear. 72 min: Aguero picks up the ball on the left and skips forward. The ball finds its way to Navas on the right touchline and his cross is cleared by Mascherano. Barcelona are all over the place here, looking really out of sorts. City are giving their makeshift defence all sorts of problems and they\u2019re not coping very well. 70 min: Manchester City substitution: Raheem Sterling, who has been excellent, makes way for Jesus Navas. 69 min: Ilkay Gundogan plays the ball forward to David Silva in the Barca penalty area, but the Spaniard is uncharacteristically slow to make a decision and is shepherded out of play. 68 min: Now De Bruyne turns provider, playing the ball inside to Sterling, who brings a smart save out of Marc-Andre ter Stegen. 67 min: This is a real ding-dong battle. City go close again, with Kevin De Bruyne curling an effort narrowly wide of the upright after being set up by Raheem Sterling. 65 min: So close from Barcelona, as Andre Gomes rattles the crossbar from just outside the penalty area with a free shot on goal. Luis Suarez nutmegs John Stones, advances and squares the ball for Gomes who really should have scored. 62 min: Sergio Roberto is having an absolute mare for Barcelona tonight. He sloppily cedes possession to Kolarov, who gallops down the left flank and squares the ball for Kevin De Bruyne. The Belgian stretches every sinew but just fails to prod the ball home. To his right, from a narrow angle, Aguero tries to divert the ball into the net, but his effort is blocked by Samuel Umtiti. 62 min: Barca substitution: Arda Turan on for Ivan Rakitic. 60 min: Kolarov gets booked for obstructing Ivan Rakitic in front of the dug-outs. Manchester City substitution: Fernando on for Fernandinho, who must have picked up a knock. 58 min: Barcelona are being made to look very ordinary indeed in the opening stages of this second half. They\u2019re struggling to get the ball out of their own half and are reduced to persistent fouling in a bid to put a stop to City\u2019s impressive gallop. 56 min: Busquets fouls De Bruyne on the left flankconceding a free-kick in line with the edge of the Barca penalty area. Silva curls the ball across the face of the six-yard box, where Sergio Aguero leaps like a diminutive Argentinian salmon. His downward header bounces inches wide of the left upright. 53 min: Another chance from City, who have Barcelona on the ropes. Sterling crosses from the inside left and this time it\u2019s Sergio Aguero stretching every sinew. He doesn\u2019t reach the ball and may have been flagged for offside even if he had. 53 min: City go close again! They won a free-kick wide on the left, whicxh Kevin de Bruyne curled in from the right touchline. Umtiti headed towards the bottom left-hand corner and it just needed a touch from Otamendi at the far post, but the defender couldn\u2019t quite reach. 52 min: That was decent free-kick from De Bruyne, but far from unstoppable. He aimed for the top right-hand corner, but didn\u2019t quite nail his effort in terms of accuracy. It didn\u2019t matter, the ball went in anyway. Kevin De Bruyne scores from the free-kick, with an effort Marc-Andre ter Stegen should have saved. I think he got a hand to it, but was unable to keep the ball out after having his view obscure by the defensive wall. 50 min: City break on the counter again and Busquets brings down David Silva on the edge of the Barcelona penalty area. Free-kick for the home side in a great position, slightly left of centre a yard or two outside the D. 49 min: Neymar goes down injured after coming out worse from a Nicolas Otamendi challenge. 47 min: Another cock-up from Sergi Roberto, who squares the ball across his own area again as he tries to play it to Sergio Busquets. City pounce again, but a heavy touch from Raheem Sterling results in the winger taking the ball wide and shooting into the side-netting from a tight angle. He should have done a lot better there. 46 min: We\u2019re off and running in the second half, with no changes on either side. Manchester City finished the first in the ascendancy and get the ball rolling for the second. Or Matthew Allen Turner, I\u2019m not quite sure. \u201cNot sure if you noticed but you seem to be able to create goals at will,\u201d he writes. \u201cSimply mention how well one team is doing and the other team instantly scores. With great power comes great responsibility, Barry. You know what you have to do.\u201d I have actually noticed this in recent minute-by-minute reports I\u2019ve done and am well aware of my obligations. Don\u2019t you worry about that. Half-time: City and Barca go in for their half-time libation with the score level at 1-1. City started well, only to be punished with extreme prejudice for their only error of the half. Having spent the middle 15 minutes of the half on the back foot, they equalised courtesy of Gundogan\u2019s second goal for the club and finished the half looking full of confidence. It\u2019s been an entertaining 45 minutes and it\u2019s all nicely poised for a thrilling second half. 45 min: City win a free-kick wide on the left and David Silva floats the ball towards the far post. Barcelona clear and the ref blows for half-time. There hasn\u2019t been a second of added time. 43 min: Messi scuttles into the Manchester City penalty area with the ball glued to his toe, only to have it unglued by a wonderfully timed tackle from Fernandinho. That\u2019s splendid defending. 43 min: Oof! City have a near miss after Rakitic loses the ball in midfield. Silva gets forward up the inside left and cuts the ball back for Fernaninho, who shoots low, diagonally and this much wide of the right upright. 40 min: Sloppy stuff from Barca, who are punished when Sergi Roberto made the schoolboy error of squaring the ball across his own penalty area and getting caught out badly. Ilkay Gundogan is the grateful recipient of a cross to the far post from Raheem Sterling after the winger had received the ball from Sergio Aguero. Ilkay Gundogan rifles home from close range after Barcelona get caught out while trying to play the ball out from the back. It\u2019s all square in Manchester. 38 min: Barcelona seem to have found their groove in recent minutes and are starting to give City the run-around. Rakitic tees up Suarez, but his low diagonal drive is blocked by Stones. Meanwhile in Germany, Borussia Moenchengladbach have gone a goal up against Celtic. As things stand, Manchester City are third in Group C, two points behind Moenchen. 35 min: Barcelona squander another two chances in quick succession. Stones blocks from Suarez, then a Messi cross to the head of Suarez on the edge of the six-yard box is a wee bit too high. 33 min: A heavy touch by Neymar in the Manchester City penalty area costs him a shooting opportunity from about 12 yards after good work from Andre Gomes, who\u2019d pulled the ball back from the byline. Manchester City clear. 32 min: City win a free-kick on the edge of the final third for a Suarez foul on Fernandinho. Kevin De Bruyne curls the ball towards the far post, but his delivery is poor and no use to man or beast. 30 min: Manchester City continue to press Barcelona and are playing well despite being a goal down. The longer the game goes on, the easier Barcelona are likely to find it to stay on the ball as their opponents tire. 29 min: Neymar takes one for the team, fouling Raheem Sterling to foil a Manchester City counter-attack in its infancy. He\u2019s duly booked and can have no complaints. 28 min: Neymar is released down the left wing and has the freedom of the pitch to make a diagonal run into the Man City penalty area. From a narrow angle, he elects to shoot for the top corner and his effort takes a defelction off John Stones to go out for a corner. 26 min: Messi advances on the City penalty area with options to his left and right. He chooses the wrong one, opting to play the ball left when Andre Gomes was in acres of space to his right. 25 min: City win a corner, which is half-cleared. Gundogan shoots straight at Marc-Andre ter Stegen 23 min: From a City free-kick, Messi played the ball to Neymar on the left flank and he hared down the wing before cutting inside and squaring the ball for his team-mate, who had galloped up in support. Messi slots the ball past Cabellero, just inside the left upright. Hmmmm. I may have spoken too soon. Messi starts and finishes a counter-attacking move that left City horribly exposed. 20 min: Rakitic gets booked for a clumsy challenge on Ilkay Gundogan after a poor first touch undser pressure. They don\u2019t like it up \u2018em, these Barcelona boys. City\u2019s intensity when not in possession is causing them all sorts of bother. 18 min: But that was then and this is now. Aguero sprints up the right flank with the ball at his feet for a third time, but Umtiti scurries across to close him down and snuff out the danger. 17 min: On third viewing, I can confirm, that there is absolutely no question Manchester City should have had a penalty. Umtiti stuck his foot out and trod on Sterling\u2019s instep as the Manchester City player attempted to slalom past him. 15 min: Elsewhere in Europe, it being November, Arsenal are of course already 2-0 down against Ludogorets. You can follow that one here. 13 min: The natives are getting restless and voicing their dissatisfaction over what, I presume, was that penalty shout that didn\u2019t go their way. Having seen it again, I think they have every right to feel aggrieved. Their team are doing well early doors, pressing Barcelona to within an inch of their lives. 10 min: Raheem Sterling is booked for diving in the Barcelona penalty area and on first look it seems harsh. He had dribbled into the area after picking up an Aguero cross from the right as Manchester City attacked on the break. There was contact as hattempted to make his way past Samuel Umtiti and Sterling went down, but I\u2019d need to see it again to ascertain whether or not it was actually a foul. Encouraging signs from City, who are doing well on the break. 9 min: Fernandinho is summoned for a dressing-0down by referee Viktor Kassai, after lunging into Ivan Rakitic and catching his shin with his studs. He was lucky to avoid a booking there. 9 min: Sterling is fouled again, this time by Andre Gomes. 7 min: Barcelona right-back Lucas Digne gets a ticking-off, but no booking, for grabbing a handful of Raheem Sterling\u2019s shirt and dragging the winger to ground as the winger tried to escape on a counter-attack. 6 min: Caballero sends a loose pass straight out of touch for a throw-in deep in City territory. 5 min: Leo Messi misplaces a pass to Neymar, lofting the ball straight to Pablo Zabaleta. 4 min: Willy Caballero gets his first touch and rolls the ball out towards the left touchline, where Fernandinho is on hand to take up possession. 3 min: Sergio Aguero is flagged for offside after latching on to a pass from the left touchline from Kevin De Bruyne. He was expecting that after mistiming his run. 2 min: Taking up a position on the left, Neymar curls a cross towards the edge of the Manchester City penalty area, where John Stones heads clear. The ball makes its way back to the Brazilian, who attempts to slide a pass in towards Luis Suarez. Nicolas Otamendi clears this time. 1 min: Manchester City\u2019s players line up in light blue shirts, white shorts and light blue socks, while their visitors play in a sort of deep purple shirts with pinkish trim, purple shorts and pinkish socks. Apologies, I don\u2019t have a Dulux colour chart to hand and can\u2019t be more specific. Following a wait in the tunnel during which several mascots and a couple of Manchester City players were gazing in reverential awe at Lionel Messi, the teams emerge and line up for the Champions League anthem. It is loudly booed by the assembled throng. Besiktas and Napoli have drawn 1-1 in Turkey, a result that has already busted my coupon for tonight. Gah! The Manchester City manager was just a little bit chippy with handsome, urbane and sophisticated BT Sport interviewer Des Kelly, stopping short of snapping at the broadcaster when he was asked if Fernando was omitted in favour of Pablo Zabaleta because he\u2019s not as experienced. \u201cHe is experienced but it\u2019s not his position,\u201d said Pep, who also said that \u201cmistakes are a part of the game\u201d when Des asked him about the need to cut them out. He also refused to entertain any chat about the inclusion of Sergio Aguero tonight, following his decision to leave him on the bench in Barcelona. \u201cWatching the warm-ups I think I have an insight into how City plan to stop Barcelona,\u201d he says. \u201cThey have had Caballero shine his head to a degree I\u2019ve never seen before. The reflection of the lights off his dome is absolutely blinding.\u201d Manchester City\u2019s substitute goalkeeper is Angus Gunn, son of former Norwich City goalkeeper Bryan. In an interview earlier this season, the 20-year-old said \u201cI wasn\u2019t old enough to see my dad play but I\u2019ve seen the videos\u201d, a statement which has made your minute-by-minute reporter feel very old indeed. He ain\u2019t half the spit of his old man, mind. Man City: Caballero, Zabaleta, Otamendi, Stones, Kolarov, Sterling, De Bruyne, Fernandinho, Gundogan, Silva, Aguero. Subs: Gunn, Kompany, Fernando, Nolito, Jesus Navas, Clichy, Iheanacho. Barcelona: ter Stegen, Sergi Roberto, Mascherano, Umtiti, Digne, Rakitic, Busquets, Andre Gomes, Messi, Luis Suarez, Neymar. Subs: Cillessen, Denis Suarez, Turan, Rafinha, Alcacer, Nili, Marlon. Referee: Viktor Kassai (Hungary) Zabaleta and Sergio Aguero both start for Manchester City. Barcelona hit four without reply and missed a penalty when the two sides met at Camp Nou the week before last. David Hytner was there for the Guardian and this is how he saw the action unfold. Pep\u2019s former team-mate (Barcelona 1996-2001) was predicting more of the same when his side face City tonight. \u201cI expect the same type of game as the last one,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they can be any more aggressive in terms of pressing than last time. They were pressing us up to the stand almost. I expect a similar script. Both teams want the same thing \u2013 to make the pitch as big as possible when they have the ball. If they leave spaces behind, we will take advantage. They are identical philosophies.\u201d He also stressed that his side would not be taking their foot off the gas despite being five points clear at the summitof Group C. \u201cWe want to be first in the group,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will have to play very well, with and without the ball. City know how to occupy space. We are going to have to play at our top, top level. They are a team with personality. We can be impressed by what [Guardiola] has done in three months. I love his philosophy, I love his ideas. Every month that goes by, they will improve. It will just mean they will get better. The immediate future is promising for them.\u201d At his pre-match press conference, Pep didn\u2019t exactly sound hugely confident of beating his former side. \u201cWe know we need to play almost perfectly to win but we will give it a go \u2013 and, if not, we will congratulate them on the way they played and set our minds on the game in Monchengladbach,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the first half we played well at Camp Nou but obviously their wide players are almost unstoppable. We have important players out too.\u201d There was some Champions League chat in yesterday\u2019s Football Weekly dispatch from near earth orbit, as well as a look back at the weekend\u2019s Premier League action and other topics du jour including a splendid retirement statement and a ref abandoning a match because one fan was being a little too tiresome. If Barcelona are to win, they will have to do so without their skipper and midfield maestro Andres Iniesta, as well as defenders Gerard Pique, Jordi Alba and J\u00e9r\u00e9my Mathieu. He\u2019s not exactly down to the bare bones, mind, as Rafinha, Arda Turan, Denis Suarez and Andre Gomes are all potential replacements for Iniesta. In Barca\u2019s defence, Samuel Umtiti is likely to fill in for Pique alongside Javier Mascherano, while Lucas Digne will almost certainly fill in for Alba at left-back. Willy Caballero will start in goal for Manchester City tonight, with Claudio Bravo confined to the naughty step following his dismissal during Manchester City\u2019s 4-0 defeat at the hands of Barcelona two weeks ago. Bravo is the fourth City player to see red in the five meetings between the two sides, a state of affairs that goes some way towards explaining their poor head-to-head record against Barcelona. Pep Guardiola is also without right-back Bacary Sagna. Having cut his foot at Camp Nou, Pablo Zabaleta trained with his team-mates yesterday but it remains unclear whether he\u2019ll be fit to play on the right side of City\u2019s defence. If he isn\u2019t, Guardiola is likely to go with Fernando, who played there against West Brom on Saturday, or 19-year-old Spaniard Pablo Maffeo, who has played twice for the first team this season, against Steaua in this competition\u2019s qualifying round and Manchester United in the League Cup. Having lost all five of their matches against Barcelona (aggregate score: 11-2) going back just three seasons, Manchester City could do with reversing the trend in their latest encounter with the La Liga champions. Currently second in Group C, just a point ahead of Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, another defeat or even a draw will relegate City to third place if the German side beat fourth-placed Celtic at Borussia-Park tonight. Kick-off is at 7.45pm (GMT), but we\u2019ll be here with team news and build-up from now. Our chief football correspondent Daniel Taylor was at the pre-match press conferences yesterday and you can read what he made of it all in the accompanying preview."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
