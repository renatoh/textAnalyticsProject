Liverpool had agreed a \u00a312m fee with Paris St-Germain for Anelka and had even prompted the 23-year-old to halve his wage demands to \u00a330,000 a week, but Houllier apparently changed his mind about completing the deal. \"I wanted to stay and I thought we had an agreement,\" Anelka said. \"I feel that Liverpool have let me down.\" He is reported to be about to have talks with Manchester City's manager Kevin Keegan, who is ready to meet PSG's \u00a312m asking price and Anelka's wage demands. The French club, under financial pressure, have made it clear he has no future with them. Anelka's star has fallen to the extent that Liverpool are willing to drop him despite privately conceding that neither West Ham nor Auxerre were willing to consider offers for their other main targets, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9 and Djibril Ciss\u00e9. That has forced Houllier to look elsewhere and his No2 Phil Thompson is in Switzerland watching France's Pierre-Alain Frau and Sidney Govou at the European Under-21 Championship. Fiorentina's Nuno Gomes, Derby's Malcolm Christie County and Lens's Senegalese international and African footballer of the year El Hadji Diouf are also possible targets One Frenchman who has definitely joined Keegan at Maine Road is the defender Sylvain Distin, who has rejected Newcastle to move to City for \u00a34m. The 24-year-old former PSG player spent most of last season on loan at Newcastle. Middlesbrough are suing Liverpool for \u00a37m damages over Christian Ziege's move to Anfield two years ago, complaining confidential knowledge of his contract had been exploited to instigate the transfer. A Premier League commission fined Liverpool \u00a320,000 for an illegal approach for the full-back, though Boro claim that the player was worth \u00a37.5m and the club would have been more successful had he stayed. Liverpool will discover today if their appeal to have the claim struck out by a high court judge has proved successful. Gary Megson's position as manager of newly promoted West Bromwich Albion was back in doubt last night after the board failed to agree on a successor to Paul Thompson as chairman. The outcome was that Albion now face another EGM and Clive Stapleton, a Thompson supporter, will take temporary charge for what could be almost two months."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
