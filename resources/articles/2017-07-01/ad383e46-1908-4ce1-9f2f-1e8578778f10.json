It is a challenge Ricky Burdett attempted in his 2006 Venice architecture biennale, and ended up bamboozling many visitors with a dense slew of diagrams and statistics, which felt like a geography textbook stuck on the wall. It is something tech giant Siemens have also tried, in their Crystal visitor centre in east London\u2019s Royal Docks, but the result has the inevitable whiff of a corporate showcase. Now the Museum of London \u2013 that most awkward of urban institutions, marooned on a roundabout in the financial Square Mile \u2013 is the latest to tackle the fact that 70% of the world\u2019s population will be living in cities by 2050. Sadly The City Is Ours hasn\u2019t made much progress on how to make the topic meaningful or engaging. The content is mostly inherited from a show that began at the Cite\u0301 des Sciences et de l\u2019Industrie in Paris (with an extra section on London at the end), and it\u2019s like a pick\u2019n\u2019mix of school curriculum themes, lacking any sense of direction. The first section, Cities Under Pressure, feels like a primary school science fair, with a handful of exhibits positioned on stands at random throughout the room. Here we learn that cities go down into the ground as well as up into the air, with a model showing tube lines and sewers beneath a street. There we hear of something called street art, which is art in public locations, \u201csometimes around socially committed issues\u201d. One stand interprets \u201cdigital traces\u201d in the city, like text messages and phone calls, in the form of abstract sounds, while another shows footage of flashmobs and protests in the Arab spring, both apparently the product of the internet and public space. For those unlucky enough to remember the original contents of the Millennium Dome, and its wall-to-wall displays of interactive platitudes, it will all be painfully familiar. The second section, Urban Futures, has a bit more meat, showcasing some of the many initiatives being developed by governments, businesses and communities to combat various urban challenges around the world. A series of short films introduce residents talking about their home cities of Medell\u00edn, Copenhagen, Detroit and South Korea\u2019s \u201csmartcity\u201d Songdo, but there is little critical commentary beyond: \u201cIt\u2019s great to live here because of the cable car/cycle lanes/urban farms/CCTV cameras (delete as appropriate).\u201d Some interesting inventions are highlighted, such as intelligent LED street lighting, which automatically dims when there\u2019s no one around, and Tokyo\u2019s Eco Cycle bike parking, which stores bikes vertically in great underground elevators. There are a wide range of community-led initiatives, too. Picking up on the slow food philosophy, the Cittaslow movement encourages city inhabitants to live at a slower pace, reduce pollution and support neighbourhood shops, as \u201can antidote to the adverse effects of globalisation\u201d. Alejandro Aravena\u2019s \u201chalf houses\u201d in Chile are shown, along with Dutch eco communities and Milan\u2019s Bosco Verticale tower blocks. But the lacklustre presentation \u2013 a caption next to a photograph or video \u2013 leaves you wanting a lot more to chew on. It\u2019s the same story in the final London-themed section, where a big interactive map on a screen highlights 25 worthy initiatives across the city, from Open Data Camden \u2013 a project to put 300 different datasets online, on everything from parking bays and planning applications to housing stock and road accidents \u2013 to Museum Freecycle in Kennington, a hub that allows museums to share unwanted items. The captions and photos that pop up on the screen will thankfully be augmented by real life discussions every Thursday, when each of the 25 groups will host a lunchtime event. Finally, in a nod to the social media age, the cafe area has been ringed with a halo of LEDs that spell out words trending on Twitter in London at that moment, along with a screen giving you the lowdown on the city\u2019s emotions. When I visited, Harrow was declared to be the happiest borough, while Haringey was the saddest (perhaps due to the council\u2019s recent decision to flog huge swaths of public property to the private sector. The trending words dancing around the perimeter of the cafe, meanwhile, read \u201cWimbledon single market doom\u201d \u2013 an appropriately jumbled haiku for an exhibition that never really manages to find its way. The City Is Ours is at Museum of London until 2 January."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
