She was English, he was Australian and they\u2019d been exchanging letters in the time they\u2019d been apart \u2013 ostensibly just as friends but with \u201ca lot of flirting going on\u201d. She didn\u2019t think they\u2019d have a future together, but she was curious about Sydney: \u201cHe was writing me stories about baby magpies and how nice it was to be back and how nice it smelled and I was thinking, \u2018I wonder what that\u2019s like?\u2019\u201d She was certain he\u2019d welcome her with open arms. That laissez faire attitude lasted until the moment she touched down in Sydney. \u201cI\u2019d saved up all the money, I was all excited, and then the second [he] turned up at the airport, I was like, \u2018Oh my God. What if this doesn\u2019t work?\u2019\u201d she remembers. \u201cBut within about 20 minutes, I knew it would be fine.\u201d And it was fine. In fact it was such a good trip that they were married the following year back in England. In 2006, they migrated to Australia and in June the couple will celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary. A love of music drew them together. Celia was 19 and a talented oboist in her first year of university, while Richard was 25 and doing a postgrad degree. Aside from his obvious musical abilities, she thought he was \u201creally cool and influential\u201d, admiring the way he organised groups to play chamber music. He\u2019d heard she was good and so he invited her to join one. \u201cI\u2019ve always had a bit of a weakness for talented women,\u201d he says. \u201cSo we organised this Brahms sextet. Celia was playing oboe and I thought, \u2018Wow. That\u2019s how an oboe is supposed to sound.\u2019 Plus she had these very sexy dimples, so I was immediately attracted to her.\u201d He adds: \u201cThe thing is, she was right up there with me intellectually and musically, and on the same wavelength in so many ways. So even though there was a fair age difference and she was only in her first year out of high school, I always saw her as an equal.\u201d They enjoyed playing together and the conversation was easy and relaxed, but they kept it casual. \u201cWhen we first started seeing each other, we weren\u2019t taking it seriously, it was just a bit of fun. I wasn\u2019t looking for lifelong love or anything like that,\u201d he says. Although they share a passion for music, there are differences too. \u201c[He\u2019s] always been more of a scientific side of music and I\u2019m more of the touchy-feely, instinctive side of it,\u201d says Celia. \u201cSo I think I saw a bit of a jigsaw puzzle that fitted quite nicely there. He complemented what I was doing.\u201d He still does: \u201cThat\u2019s why Richard\u2019s my producer when I\u2019m making records because I trust what he\u2019s saying.\u201d After a year of study, Richard returned to Australia. When Celia came to visit, it was clear there was something special between them. But she had a place at the Royal Academy of Music for her postgraduate studies, so she returned to England. Richard wanted to follow but there was a complication. He could no longer apply for a working holiday visa; the only option was a marriage visa. And while they wanted to live together in the UK for a year first, he had to apply from Australia. So they decided to get married \u2013 he proposed on Valentine\u2019s Day and they had a country wedding in June. Although their decision was rushed, both knew it was something they intended to do. \u201cI\u2019m hopeless at making decisions like that. I would dilly-dally forever except for the practicalities that we couldn\u2019t be together unless we were married.\u201d says Richard. \u201cBut I knew that I enjoyed being with Celia and that we always had fun together, and so why not? I remember having that conversation with my parents: \u2018How can I ever make this decision?\u2019. My dad, he was a man of few words, looked at me with a wry little smile and said, \u2018Celia looks all right to me.\u2019 So I said, \u2018Oh, right. That\u2019s good enough for me then!\u2019\u201d Celia felt the same way \u201cThere were lots of people buzzing around me saying, \u2018Are you sure?\u2019 I was 21 when we got engaged \u2026 I just always go with an instinct. I do everything like that, really. If it feels right then it\u2019s right, and it felt right, so I did it.\u201d The pair come from similar backgrounds and have similar values too. \u201cWhen there\u2019s been a choice to make, every time I\u2019m impressed with the choices that have been made,\u201d Celia says. \u201cI think it is the tough times that actually make you strong.\u201d One of the tough times came when the family were living in Wales and had two very young children. Celia was offered a prestigious job in London and Richard supported her, but it took months to sell their home. So Celia commuted, staying in London for a few nights and then returning to the family in Wales each week. Eventually they moved to London but it continued to be a stressful juggling act, with Celia often touring around Europe leaving Richard at home with the children. \u201cEssentially I was a stay-at-home dad, and I was happy to do that,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019d been together 10 years before [their first child] and I was ready for kids long before Celia was.\u201d His wife was younger and ambitious and he was happy to support her. \u201cI really enjoyed being the father and supporting Celia as the breadwinner. I think you just have to be flexible and accept those changing roles as your circumstances change.\u201d Roles were reversed when they moved to Australia in 2006. It was a big decision, as Celia was in her dream job at the time, working as the chairman of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, playing the Last Night of the Proms and working with the London Symphony Orchestra. Still, when Richard said he wanted to go because his father was ill, she agreed. \u201cI suddenly thought, \u2018Actually, I have done everything that I wanted to do.\u2019\u201d Neither had jobs or a home to go to. Fortunately the couple share an adventurous spirit. \u201cWe\u2019ve been quite heavy risk-takers in some ways because we didn\u2019t know how we were going to actually make a crust if we came to Australia. We just played it as it came,\u201d says Richard. Celia agrees: \u201cI like the risk-taking. I think it\u2019s an incredible adventure and it\u2019s the way to keep everything alive.\u201d They settled in the Blue Mountains and Richard set up his own business repairing musical instruments, while Celia looked after their children. Raising children together has been a challenge as they haven\u2019t always had the same approach, especially during the teenage years. \u201cThe kids have the potential to drive a wedge because they\u2019re always asking the other one for an opinion on that one, all the time: \u2018Oh, but Dad just said this.\u2019 All the time. So that\u2019s dangerous, but we got through it as well.\u201d Celia is a disciplinarian while Richard is gentler. That\u2019s been the cause of some of their few arguments, but they managed to navigate it. They\u2019ve learned a few things over the years. \u201c[Always] assume, when things get tough, that the other person is doing their best,\u201d says Celia. \u201cNot blaming each other for stuff ... I think we\u2019re quite good at seeing things from each other\u2019s point of view.\u201d She adds: \u201cThere\u2019s no point [getting into] dialogue that says, \u2018You always do this.\u2019 That kind of thing is completely pointless.\u201d Richard agrees: \u201cWe\u2019re always willing to step up to support each other in difficult times. I went through a terrible time when my dad died a couple of years ago. I knew that Celia was always there for that emotional support that I needed. Similarly, when she\u2019s gone through bad patches of being unhappy at work or whatever, you just make the commitment to be there for each other.\u201d There\u2019s something else too, says Richard: \u201cWe still fancy each other. It may not be the most important thing but it is a crucial element to a long-term relationship.\u201d They are both very affectionate, cuddling and kissing often. \u201cIf you\u2019ve had a shit day at work, then it\u2019s nice to have a cuddle,\u201d Celia says. \u201cI think that\u2019s just really important. It\u2019s like a physical need, that everyone needs affection,\u201d Richard says. For Celia, their relationship success comes down to their shared sense of adventure and purpose. \u201cWe\u2019ve never gone, \u2018Right, that\u2019s it, we\u2019re finished now. We\u2019re here. We\u2019re just going to do the same thing for 30 years.\u2019 We\u2019ve never done that and I\u2019m sure we\u2019re still not now.\u201d We want to hear your stories about staying together.
