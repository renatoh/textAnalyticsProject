Who in their right minds would pick a winner - or even a runner-up - for this intensely close slog for a World Cup prize in two years' time. Three games in and as we stand four nations (Switzerland, the Republic of Ireland, France, Israel) are locked together on five points. Ireland earned a well-deserved draw and heaped discomfort on a France side who look increasingly unhappy under the current regime. There was no underestimating the significance of this fixture between two sides who fancy themselves for automatic qualification as Group 4 winners. Although it was as well that the Irish were in town, as otherwise there would have been no clue of a sellout international in Paris. During the afternoon the only people demonstrating their faith on the banks of the Seine who were not wearing green were Hare Krishnas. Once inside the stadium, the estimated 30,000 Irish leant volume to the home team's national anthem by jigging and la-la-la-ing through the Marseillais. Extraordinary. No mistaking whose veins were coursing with optimism. France desperately needed a boost to stop the current mood of disillusionment becoming too entrenched. L'Equipe 's banner headline had warned that this was 'the moment of truth'. Raymond Domenech's brief reign has been so heavily undermined by player unrest, disappointing form and media bullets that his position is said, by some, to depend upon this set of games (they take on Cyprus, in Nicosia, on Wednesday night). It was a huge test of the inexperience evident in the heart of the team: the central defensive partnership of Sebastien Squillaci and Ga\u00ebl Givet took the field with six caps between them, while in front of them Rio Antonio Mavuba, an Angolan famously born on a refugee boat off the African coast, started for the first time in place of the suspended Patrick Vieira. With the midfield battleground obviously up for grabs, Brian Kerr plumped for Kevin Kilbane's energy to dovetail with the old warrior Roy Keane. The ex-captain seized the initiative from the off with a delicious through-ball to Clinton Morrison, who couldn't quite react quickly enough to test Fabien Barthez. A golden chance. Half-chances came fairly regularly - Steve Finnan cut inside and shot straight at Barthez, Morrison squirted a header wide, Robbie Keane and Damien Duff were blocked in the same move. Ireland were in their element, determined to show confidence and aggression before France could find any kind of groove. Just who was at home here? Robert Pires made himself the visiting public's enemy numero un when he went down easily to win a free-kick a yard outside the penalty area and was consistently jeered afterwards. France looked rudderless for the first half-hour - no evidence that they were gelling more as a team (either technically or spiritually) under Domenech's idiosyncratic stewardship. But with half-time approaching they began to exert some pressure, as William Gallas and Pires tested Given with awkward shots. Gallas, pushing up whenever possible, found considerable space to attack. Consequently limiting his Chelsea colleague, Damien Duff, who was forced to track back more often than Ireland would have liked. Attacking options were shifted slightly more five minutes before half-time when their main aerial threat, Clinton Morrison, shuffled off injured. His replacement, Andy Reid, whipped a shot that Barthez fumbled shortly after half-time, but Robbie Keane couldn't reach the loose ball. France, sensing the gravity of the situation, responded and should have taken the lead when Pires found Gallas from a free-kick, only for the defender to scuff it. Then Djibril Ciss\u00e9 saw a firm shot blocked. Back came Ireland, Duff volleying from a pinballed corner to lift the Irish spirits. The game was tensing up, tight as a snare drum, with both teams aware of how critical this tussle could be come the final group reckoning. France, requiring experience and nerve, could have done without Olivier Dacourt limping out and giving way for a debutant replacement in Alou Diarra. (How good did Claude Makelele and Zinedine Zidane, who retired from the international scene in the summer, feel watching on at home?) They could also have done without Barthez clowning around inside his box just when they needed calm heads. Ireland smelled blood. Keane glanced a header at Barthez and then John O'Shea was oh-so-close, steering a volley fractionally wide of the far post from Reid's free-kick. Given was more heroic at the other end, stretching to paw away a rare chance for Thierry Henry. Honours even, although a good deal of the honour here, it must be said, went to the thousands of travelling Irish.
