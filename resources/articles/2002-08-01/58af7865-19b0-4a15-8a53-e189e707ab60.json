His top-of-the-range establishment actually. It opened last year and offers six luxury bedrooms. Apparently, Rick had his eye on the two cottages behind The Seafood Restaurant for many years but had to wait patiently until they both eventually came onto the market. What's so top of the range about it? The large, airy rooms all have double french doors with views across the formal garden to the estuary. If you're on the ground floor you also get your own private deck area so you can doze off to the gentle murmur of the fountain. The unusually large garden allowed the Steins to add a guest car park, which may not sound like much of a luxury until you've tried to find a parking space in Padstow. What about the rooms? Inside, the style is neo-nautical; cool and minimalist with plenty of natural materials and the odd, strategically placed reminder of Rick. Watch out for the ubiquitous fish. The cherrywood four-posters are wonderfully comfy and there's a wide-screen TV, DVD and CD player with surround sound if you like fiddling with knobs. However, the marble-clad bathroom held my favourite gizmo: a double-headed shower that is designed to replicate a tropical rainstorm. Oh, and a booking here more or less guarantees you a table for dinner in The Seafood Restaurant. Decent evening meal then? Obviously, although three courses with wine may blow your budget out of the water. While the food is faultless, the atmosphere isn't quite as relaxed as the publicity would have you believe. The couple next to us complained bitterly when a youngman dared enter wearing - horrors! - short sleeves and no tie. Breakfast, also served in the restaurant, is much less constrained. I can recommend the haddock, although the full English also looked good. \u00b7 St Edmund's House, Padstow, Cornwall (01841 532700). Rooms cost \u00a3210, including breakfast. A new TV series, Rick Stein's Food Heroes, starts on BBC2 on 13 August."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
