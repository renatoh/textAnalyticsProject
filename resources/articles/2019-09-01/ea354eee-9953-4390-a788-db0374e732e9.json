Arts Council England (ACE) on Thursday published details of 46 objects and collections worth \u00a358.6m that will go to UK museums and galleries in lieu of tax. There are also rare Islamic ceramics from a city destroyed by the Mongols in 1220-21, 18th-century gilt tables and mirrors designed by Thomas Chippendale, and antique nipple shields once used by breast-feeding women to ease discomfort. The diverse treasures are listed in a report giving details of the 2018-19 successes for the UK\u2019s acceptance in lieu and cultural gifts schemes. The former was introduced by the then chancellor, David Lloyd George, in 1910 as a way of allowing people to offset inheritance tax bills, and the latter in 2013 so that people could donate during their lifetime. The total value of the objects is more than double the previous financial year and the highest since the two schemes were bundled together in 2013. Sir Nicholas Serota, the chair of ACE, welcomed a record-breaking year for the schemes that were \u201ctwo hugely important ways for exceptional works of art, objects, manuscripts and archives to enter public collections throughout the country\u201d. He added: \u201cIt is also heartening to see that, in line with last year, around 86% of the total tax settled has been for items allocated outside London.\u201d One of those objects is the Rubens portrait of Charles V in his full imperial armour, which has gone to the Royal Armouries in Leeds. The painting is a copy of a Titian portrait that was in the Spanish royal collection but is considered lost, probably destroyed in a fire. \u201cThis is a portrait of great importance,\u201d the report says. \u201cBoth for recording a lost Titian, and for being in its own right a powerful work by one of the most famed and accomplished painters of the 17th century.\u201d It was also a painting which Rubens personally kept hold of until his death in 1640, evidence of the high regard the artist held it in. The Hirst sculpture, titled Wretched War, has been given by the artist\u2019s former business manager Frank Dunphy, settling \u00a390,000 of tax. It has gone to the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art. Dunphy also handed over 73 drawings on placemats made by Hirst during their twice weekly breakfast meetings at the Wolseley restaurant in London. One important discussion was over the best way to crack open an egg, resulting in a drawing of Dunphy as a boiled egg, titled Frank eggs-ellent Dunphy. The collection, some with food and drink stains, settles \u00a390,000 of tax and has been allocated to the British Museum. Ten organisations, including the Towner gallery in Eastbourne, East Sussex, the Museum of East Anglian Life in Stowmarket, Suffolk, and Kew Gardens in London were allocated objects for the first time. Kew received a collection of 361 botanical drawings \u2013 of orchids and fungi \u2013 by the illustrator Florence Helen Woolward. Another first-time recipient was the Royal College of Physicians, which was permanently given one of the oddest collections in the list: 450 antique medical and self-care objects which include nipple shields made from ivory, silver, glass, wood, leather and lead. The collection has been on loan to the college since 1996 and is now in its ownership, settling \u00a346,500 of tax. The most valuable item in the list is a Bernardo Bellotto painting of Venice on Ascension Day, which settles \u00a37m of tax and was allocated to Audley End house in Essex. Edward Harley, who chairs the acceptance in lieu panel, said the schemes were vital mechanisms that allowed exceptional items to enter public collections: \u201cIt is heartening to see that the list of first-time allocatees continues to grow and that it has been a bumper year for high-value items going outside the capital.\u201d He also expressed a wish to see more large corporations consider giving some of their treasures to the nation and receiving 20% of the gift\u2019s value as a corporation tax deduction."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
