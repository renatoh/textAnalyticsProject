Auxerre's France defender is aware that he has been the subject of discussions between the clubs but does not expect to move before the end of the season. Boumsong said: \"There has been contact with Liverpool but I don't know anything about it and I have not signed anything.\" The 23-year-old will be out of contract next summer so could begin negotiating with Liverpool in January, in accordance with international transfer regulations. The Liverpool defence put together by their manager G\u00e9rard Houllier this season has looked fragile, particularly at The Valley last Sunday when Charlton beat Liverpool 3-2, inspired by Kevin Lisbie's hat-trick. Auxerre's manager Guy Roux, an old friend of Houllier, is trying to resist Liverpool's interest in Boumsong and his France striker Djibril Ciss\u00e9. The Portsmouth chairman Milan Mandaric has hit back at critics of the Premiership club's transfer policy and the \"wheeler-dealer\" label attached to their manager, Harry Redknapp. He said: \"That impression is highly offensive to this club, the manager and its wonderful supporters \"Harry is a superb manager who has brought the good times back. We have signed 12 quality players this season and are round the middle of the table in the Premier League with regard to expenditure.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
