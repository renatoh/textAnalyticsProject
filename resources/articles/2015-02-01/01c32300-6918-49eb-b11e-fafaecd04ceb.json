Ramires is the likely beneficiary of Nemanja Matic\u2019s two-game suspension and the Brazilian, by no means a regular starter these days but often relied upon as a horse for the big-game course, feels that there is lost time to make up for. \u201cIt is true I haven\u2019t had the best of seasons,\u201d he says. \u201cI suffered a few injuries and had a setback that pushed me back. Now I\u2019m fit and the team is in need of someone to step in. If I\u2019m able to play I\u2019ll do whatever needs doing, and hopefully we can win this trophy.\u201d Ramires took time to recover from an abductor muscle injury sustained at Manchester City in September, but has returned to form as what Jos\u00e9 Mourinho last month called \u201cthe best Ramires\u201d in recent weeks. Realistically, just as relevant to his lack of playing time has been the form of Matic and Cesc F\u00e0bregas as Chelsea\u2019s central pair; Ramires\u2019s athleticism and presence in both boxes make him a viable replacement for either and he recently deputised during F\u00e0bregas\u2019s lay-off. But he has started alongside both in high-stakes fixtures such as last week\u2019s draw at Paris Saint-Germain and that match at the Etihad, and his record of decisive moments on the big stage \u2013 memories of his goalscoring contributions in the 2012 FA Cup final and the same season\u2019s Champions League semi-final win over Barcelona remain vivid \u2013 is strong. \u201cI had a major role when we won the Champions League,\u201d he says. \u201cBut players go through different phases in their careers within the same club. I\u2019ve had an injury and lost a lot of playing time. We\u2019ve got a very good squad with big competition; anyone could play but only 11 get on the pitch. When I don\u2019t play, maybe I\u2019m a bit moody \u2013 but in my head I think competition is good to keep everyone on their toes.\u201d He is certainly the most practiced of stand-ins and will come across another Brazilian understudy at Wembley. The oft-maligned Paulinho may not start for Tottenham Hotspur but the pair have a close relationship \u2013 as might any two people who were given the hopeless task of entering the pitch as half-time substitutes with Brazil 5-0 down in a World Cup semi-final against Germany. \u201cWe\u2019re actually very, very good friends off the pitch,\u201d he says. \u201cNot only myself but also our families. My wife is good friends with his wife and they spend a lot of time together. So it\u2019s going to be very interesting playing against him. We both know it\u2019s a big, big game. On the pitch there are no friends, but then life goes on and friendship goes on as well. \u201cI won\u2019t be talking to him before the game, there\u2019s already enough stuff going around, so I\u2019m just going to leave that. I know he\u2019s not going to text or call me either, and I prefer it that way.\u201d While the pair have that chastening summer experience in common, Ramires says that winning silverware against Tottenham would not serve to salve the wounds it inflicted. \u201cThese are two absolutely different things. This is a final with Chelsea. What happened in the World Cup happened with the national team and the only thing that can make that any better will be in the next tournament playing for Brazil.\u201d Ramires was again a half-time replacement in Chelsea\u2019s 5-3 defeat at White Hart Lane on New Year\u2019s Day. His introduction at 3-1 down did something to staunch the home side\u2019s flow but he is expecting a tighter affair from the beginning this time. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be similar to other games we\u2019ve played before,\u201d he says. \u201cThose were open games \u2013 they won at home, we won at home. Now we are playing at Wembley for a title and it might be more of a close game, at least at the beginning \u2013 a completely different story.\u201d If the \u201cbest Ramires\u201d turns up again, then it might yet be one that Chelsea supporters have been happy to read before."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
