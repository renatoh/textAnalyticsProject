It throws in a touch of Moby-Dick in the form of grizzled shark hunter Robert Shaw, and in typical reconciliatory manner brings together an unlikely 1970s duo \u2013 a hippy ichthyologist (Dreyfuss) and a uniformed police chief (Scheider)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
