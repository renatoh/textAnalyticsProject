Returning to Elkhart, Indiana, the first city he visited as president, Obama defended his economic record over the past seven years against not only Republicans but \u201ctalking heads\u201d who theorise that outsiders Trump and Bernie Sanders have thrived because of bad trade deals that hollowed out communities. The president stood at a podium jacketless, with his sleeves rolled up, apparently relishing a return to election campaign mode even though he is not on the ballot. He did not mention Trump or Hillary Clinton by name but displayed how he is likely to be a formidable weapon for his fellow Democrat during the general election. \u201cThe one thing I can promise you is if we turn against each other based on divisions of race or religion, if we fall for a bunch of okey doke just because it sounds funny or the tweets are provocative, then we\u2019re not going to build on the progress that we\u2019ve started,\u201d he said to applause and cheers from 2,000 people in a brightly lit gymnasium. \u201cIf we get cynical and just vote our fears, or if we don\u2019t vote at all, we won\u2019t build on the progress that we\u2019ve started.\u201d Obama had been in office for three weeks when he set foot in Elkhart in early 2009, in the midst of a fight for Congress to pass a roughly $800bn economic stimulus package. Part of his administration\u2019s response to the financial crisis, he said, were the toughest Wall Street laws in history, forcing the biggest banks to carry twice the amount of capital they used to and putting in place a new consumer watchdog, thereby reducing the likelihood of a repeat. \u201cThe Republican nominee for president has already said he\u2019d dismantle all these rules that we passed,\u201d Obama said, his voice rising with incredulity. \u201cThat is crazy. I\u2019ll be honest with you, sometimes I just don\u2019t get it. How it is that somebody could propose that we weaken regulations on Wall Street? \u201cHave we really forgotten what just happened eight years ago? It hasn\u2019t been that long ago and because of their reckless behaviour, you got hurt.\u201d Despite his efforts, the wealthiest Americans are still paying far lower tax rates than they used to, the president continued. \u201cToday, even as the top 1% is doing better than ever for all the reasons I talked about earlier, the Republican nominee for president\u2019s tax plan would give the top one-tenth of 1% a bigger tax cut than the 120 million American households at the bottom. \u201cIt would explode our deficits by nearly $10tn. I\u2019m not making this up. You can look at the math. That will not bring jobs back. That is not fighting for the American middle class. That will not help us win. That is not going to make your lives better, that will help people like him.\u201d As the crowd rose to its feet and applauded, Obama added: \u201cThat\u2019s the truth.\u201d He also took Trump to task over his plan to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants. He said the number of people trying to cross the US-Mexico border illegally is near its lowest level in 40 years. While it is true that new immigrants sometimes compete for service and construction jobs, he added, they also start about 30% of new businesses in America and pay more in taxes than they receive in services. \u201cMost importantly, immigrants are not the main reason why wages haven\u2019t gone up for middle-class families,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThose decisions are made in the boardrooms of companies where top CEOs are getting paid more than 300 times the income of the average worker. So deporting 11 million immigrants \u2013 not only is that a fantasy that would cost taxpayers billions of dollars and tear families apart and just logistically would be impossible \u2013 even if it were possible, it wouldn\u2019t do anything to seriously help the middle class.\u201d Broadening his critique to \u201cmyth-busting\u201d Republican orthodoxy, Obama continued: \u201cThe primary story that Republicans have been telling about the economy is not supported by the facts. They repeat it a lot but it\u2019s not supported by the facts, but they say it anyway. Now, why is that? It\u2019s because it has worked to get them votes, at least at the congressional level.\u201d The president\u2019s speech in Elkhart came against a background in which the theory that a sluggish economy, stagnant wages and the migration of manufacturing jobs overseas fuelled the rise of Trump and Sanders. Some foreign diplomats worry about a surge of protectionism in America: Clinton, Sanders and Trump have all come out against Obama\u2019s Trans-Pacific Partnership. \u201cThe truth is trade has helped our country a lot more than it\u2019s hurt us,\u201d Obama insisted. \u201cExports helped lead us out of the recession. Companies that export pay workers higher wages than folks who don\u2019t export. And anybody who says that somehow shutting ourselves off from trade is going to bring jobs back, they\u2019re just not telling the truth.\u201d Most manufacturing jobs lost over the past decade were not from trade deals but technology and automation that let businesses make more products with fewer workers, he argued. Perhaps weary of hearing his economic record hammered on the campaign trail, Obama was also eager to shore up his legacy. \u201cNow, I\u2019m the first to admit my presidency hasn\u2019t fixed everything. We\u2019ve had setbacks. We\u2019ve had false starts. We\u2019ve frankly been stuck with a Congress recently that\u2019s opposed pretty much everything that we\u2019ve tried to do.\u201d But he was adamant: \u201cBy almost every economic measure, America\u2019s better off than when I came here at the beginning of my presidency,\u201d he said to cheers and whistles. \u201cThat\u2019s the truth. That\u2019s true. That\u2019s true. That\u2019s true.\u201d In Elkhart, he noted, unemployment had peaked at 19.6% but was now down to around 4%. The recovery came about as demand for RVs, the motorhomes that are central to the local economy, bounced back. Nevertheless, he got \u201cwhupped\u201d in the county at the last election and had not come looking for votes. \u201cI came here precisely because this county votes Republican. If the economy is what\u2019s really driving this election, then it\u2019s going to be voters like you that have to decide between two very different visions of what\u2019s going to help strengthen our middle class. You\u2019re going to have to make that decision.\u201d An audience member shouted for him to stay for another term. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t do that,\u201d Obama replied with a laugh. \u201cThe constitution prohibits it but, more importantly, Michelle prohibits it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
