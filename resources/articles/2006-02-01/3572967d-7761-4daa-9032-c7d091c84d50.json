Depending on the time of year, there's heating or air-conditioning, and the tents are decorated with tribal throws and wrought-iron furniture. And, unlike classic camping holidays, entertainment is low-key, centred on a swimming pool, atmospheric local music and watching bread being cooked in the ground, under a covering of sand.
