We\u2019ve launched a new one at the link below where I\u2019ll be taking you through the latest news, analysis and the occasional cheerful tweet for the next few hours: A satisfying PSA from the Ohio Department of Health: That White House press briefing is now over. Here are the main points: White House officials are looking at whether health workers can wear reusable cloth gowns, instead of disposable ones, which are running out. The US treasury is on track to issue first cash payments by next week. Mike Pence says the administration is \u201con the timetable\u201d to send out the first round of stimulus checks by the end of next week. Many Americans will receive up to $1,200. Trump said that the US has \u201cpurchased and stockpiled millions and millions of doses\u201d of hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malaria drug Trump has been touting as a game-changer in the fight against Covid-19. Medical experts, including the US National Institute of Health\u2019s Anthony Fauci, has said there is no clinical evidence yet that the drug can effectively treat the disease. Ventilator shortages: \u201cWe\u2019re in good shape,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou\u2019re not hearing of people needing ventilators much.\u201d It is true that some states have ended up with more ventilators than they think they need. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that there isn\u2019t a national shortage. The US has roughly 173,000 ventilators, according to the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins University. Experts from Harvard Medical School predict that the US could end up needing 31 times that number to treat coronavirus patients. Trump said his conversation with Vladimir Putin and Mohammed Bin Salman was \u201cvery good,\u201d he said. They\u2019re \u201cgetting close to a deal\u201d and \u201cgetting along very well.\u201d Dr. Fauci, on what it could mean to \u201creopen\u201d the country: \u201cOften, people say re-open the government, like it\u2019s a light switch on-and-off for the entire country. We have a very large country with really different patterns of disease and outbreaks in different parts of the country. So, it\u2019s not going to be a one size fits all.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting here that the federal government doesn\u2019t have the power to \u201cswitch on\u201d the economy all at once. States, counties and cities ultimately have a lot of authority to enforce distancing measures for as long as they deem necessary. Coronavirus testing by age: Earlier in the briefing Dr. Deborah Birx presented the following numbers on testing nationally: People younger than 25: 200,000 have been tested of which 11% tested positive Age 25-45: 500,000 were tested, 17% were positive Age 45-65: 500,000 were tested, 21% were positive Age 65-85: 200,000 were tested, 22% were positive People older than 85: 30,000 tested, 24% were positive There are more than 100,000 Americans being tested for coronavirus every day, Pence says. At the White House press briefing happening now, Vice President and leader of the Coronavirus Task Force Mike Pence also said that White House officials are looking at whether health workers can wear reusable cloth gowns, instead of disposable ones, which are running out. Hospitals may have to \u201crecycle gowns\u201d to stretch their supplies. You can get in touch with me directly on Twitter @helenrsullivan \u2013 questions, comments, tips and news from where you live are welcome. That\u2019s it from my esteemed colleague Nadeem Badshah for today. I\u2019m Helen Sullivan, with you now for the next few hours. We\u2019ll be bringing you the latest from the White House press conference for the next little while, where Vice President Mike Pence says the US treasury is on track to issue first cash payments by next week. Pence said the administration is \u201con the timetable\u201d to send out the first round of stimulus checks by the end of next week. Many Americans will receive up to US$1,200. Boris Johnson moved out of intensive care The British prime minister has been moved out of intensive care but remains at St Thomas\u2019 Hospital in London, Downing Street said. A spokesman for the Boris Johnson said: \u201cThe prime minister has been moved this evening from intensive care back to the ward, where he will receive close monitoring during the early phase of his recovery. He is in extremely good spirits.\u201d Johnson was transferred to an intensive care unit on Monday. Global death toll passes 94,000, US overtakes Spain\u2019s total casualties The global death toll has passed 94,000 on the Johns Hopkins University tracker \u2013 the current figure is 94,807. The US has now overtaken Spain with over 16,000 deaths. Spain has 15,238, according to the Maryland-based university\u2019s research. Italy is the country with the highest coronavirus-related deaths at 19,279. Trump says new coronavirus treatment \u2018will be tested soon\u2019 President Trump said that Pfizer has found a \u201cpromising new treatment that might prevent the virus from replicating\u201d and that it hopes to begin testing in clinical trials \u201cvery soon\u201d. In a press conference, he added that through the FDA\u2019s coronavirus treatment acceleration programme, 19 therapies and treatments are being tested and 26 more \u201care in the active planning for clinical trials\u201d. However, there has been scepticism over Trump\u2019s earlier claims for possible treatments including the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine. South Africa extends lockdown by a further fortnight South Africa\u2019s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has announced it will extend its coronavirus lockdown by a further two weeks. He had imposed a 21-day total lockdown on the country\u2019s 56 million inhabitants on 27 March, enforced by the police and the army. On Thursday, Ramaphosa said: \u201cThis evening, I stand before you to ask you to endure even longer. I have to ask you to make even greater sacrifices so that our country may survive this crisis and so that tens of thousands of lives may be saved.\u201d France\u2019s death toll rises to more than 12,000 The country has said the total death toll in hospitals and nursing homes has risen to 12,210, from 10,869 on Wednesday, with care homes accounting for more than a third of all fatalities. The number of people in intensive care has fallen slightly for the first time since the start of the outbreak. J\u00e9r\u00f4me Salomon, head of the public health authority, said there were now 7,062 people in intensive care at hospitals, a net decrease of 82 from a day earlier. US economy \u2018could reopen in May\u2019 The US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said the American economy could start to reopen for business in May despite experts\u2019 emphasis on prolonged physical distancing measures to defeat the coronavirus. Asked on CNBC whether he thought Donald Trump could reopen the economy so soon, Mnuchin said: \u201cI do.\u201d \u201cAs soon as the president feels comfortable with the medical issues, we are making everything necessary that American companies and American workers can be open for business.\u201d Australian minister fined for breaching lockdown rules The New South Wales minister for arts, Don Harwin, has been fined $1,000 for breaching the state\u2019s strict public health orders. It emerged he had left Sydney for his property on the Central Coast, despite the government urging the public to delay non-essential travel. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has resisted calls to sack Harwin, saying he did not break the rules because he moved to his Central Coast home before the state lockdown came into effect. Eurozone countries strike deal on coronavirus rescue Eurozone finance ministers have reached an agreement on an emergency rescue package aimed at responding to the economic adversity triggered by coronavirus. Finance ministers from countries including the Netherlands, Italy, Germany and France clapped over their teleconference. \u201cWe acted decisively for our citizens in less than a month,\u201d M\u00e1rio Centeno, the Portuguese finance minister and president of the group, told his counterparts. The package includes a boost to the lending capacity of the European Investment Bank and a new unemployment insurance scheme proposed by the European commission. WHO had warned about risk of Covid-19 in January The World Health Organization warned the US and other countries about the risk of human-to-human transmission of Covid-19 as early as 10 January, and urged precautions even though initial Chinese studies at that point had found no clear evidence of that route of infection. Technical guidance notes seen by the Guardian and briefings by top WHO officials warned of potential human-to-human transmission and made clear that there was a threat of catching the disease through water droplets and contaminated surfaces, based on the experience of earlier coronavirus outbreaks. Donald Trump has attempted to blame the WHO for the pandemic, pointing to a WHO tweet on 14 January saying \u201cthere was no human-to-human transmission\u201d. Pope holds Holy Thursday mass in empty St Peter\u2019s Basilica Pope Francis presided at a scaled-down Holy Thursday mass in an empty St Peter\u2019s Basilica. He spoke from a secondary altar behind the main one he normally uses and the occasion was attended by only two dozen people, including a few aides, nuns and a scaled-down choir. The pope said: \u201cThese days more than 60 (priests) have died here in Italy while taking care of the sick, in hospitals. Together with the doctors and nurses they are the saints next door.\u201d Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, said it would be the \u201cworst of all possible worlds\u201d to let some parts of the UK come out of lockdown at different times. Speaking to the BBC\u2019s Newsnight programme, Burnham said: \u201cThe suggestion I\u2019ve heard, and I really don\u2019t like the sound of it, is this idea it might be phased on a regional basis. \u201cSo lifted in London first, and possibly then possibly in the Midlands. All that I can tell you is it would be impossible to sustain here if there were images of people going back to pubs in other parts of the country. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be the same thing for the whole of the country.\u201d He added: \u201cA phased release, I think, would be awful. The worst of all possible worlds and I hope the Government will resist that.\u201d In a press conference, President Trump said that Pfizer has found a \u201cpromising new treatment that might prevent the virus from replicating\u201d and that it hopes to begin testing in clinical trials \u201cvery soon\u201d. He added that through the FDA\u2019s coronavirus treatment acceleration programme, 19 therapies and treatments are being tested and 26 more \u201care in the active planning for clinical trials\u201d. The New South Wales minister for arts, Don Harwin, has been fined $1,000 for breaching the state\u2019s strict public health orders. For more information, head over to our Australia blog - Eurogroup finance ministers have reached an agreement over an emergency rescue package aimed at responding to the economic adversity caused by coronavirus. Finance ministers from countries including the Netherlands, Italy, Germany and France clapped at the end of their teleconference. \u201cWe acted decisively for our citizens in less than a month,\u201d M\u00e1rio Ceteno, the eurogroup president, told ministers. The package includes a boost to the lending capacity of the European Investment Bank and a new unemployment insurance scheme proposed by the European Commission, The Financial Times reported. The group will also propose a recovery fund to help with the post-lockdown economic recovery. A police force have been forced to reassure people they will not be searching their shopping trolleys after a chief constable threatened to introduce the measure if \u201cwe don\u2019t get the compliance we would expect\u201d. Northamptonshire Police chief constable, Nick Adderley, prompted criticism after saying his force was \u201conly a few days away\u201d from \u201cmarshalling supermarkets and checking the items in baskets and trolleys to see whether it\u2019s a legitimate, necessary item\u201d. He also warned roadblocks would be set up if members of the public did not adhere to government guidelines designed to curb the spread of coronavirus. Within hours of his comments in a news conference being reported, the force\u2019s official Twitter account has seemingly contradicted him. \u201cTo clarify some suggestions made in the media, we absolutely will NOT be searching people\u2019s shopping trolleys in Northamptonshire,\u201d it said. \u201cThe same message was communicated to our officers from the very moment we were given these new powers.\u201d Emergency workers battling coronavirus are being spat on or coughed at daily by people who have or claim to have the virus, the Director of Public Prosecutions said. Max Hill QC said many had been jailed for assault or for crimes that cash in on the COVID-19 pandemic, and warned that others who commit such offences would be fast-tracked into court and risked prison. He told the Crown Prosecution Service\u2019s website: \u201cIt is disappointing to see charges come in on a daily basis of hard-working police officers, NHS staff and other vital workers, being coughed or spat at, sometimes deliberately exposing them to the risk of infecting them with coronavirus. \u201cWe take these offences immensely seriously and want to make it absolutely clear that where there is evidence to do so, people will be prosecuted and can face up to one year in prison.\u201d Friday\u2019s Telegraph front page The Guardian\u2019s UK edition front page Friday\u2019s Daily Mail front page The Daily Telegraph\u2019s Friday splash Tomorrow\u2019s Daily Mirror Friday\u2019s front pages in the UK have come in, starting with The Times. UN secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, warned the coronavirus pandemic is deepening existing inequalities and is having devastating social and economic consequences for women and girls that could reverse limited progress toward gender equality over the last 25 years. He said in a video message and policy paper that across every sphere, from health to the economy, security to social protection, the impact of COVID-19 are exacerbated for women and girls simply by virtue of their sex. While early data indicates the mortality rates from COVID-19 may be higher for men, Gutterres said nearly 60 per cent of women around the world work in the informal economy - earning less, saving less, and at greater risk of falling into poverty. He said millions of womens jobs have been lost at the same time that their unpaid work has increased exponentially as a result of school closures and children being at home, and the increased needs of older people. Uganda\u2019s president has released a video of his home workout to encourage people to stay indoors during the coronavirus lockdown, becoming the country\u2019s answer to Joe Wicks. Chileans have a \u201cmoral duty\u201d to stay home over the Easter holiday to stave of the spread of the coronavirus, Interior Minister Gonzalo Blumel said after reports surfaced of wealthy Santiago residents sneaking off to coastal enclaves by helicopter and private plane. Chile has confirmed nearly 6,000 coronavirus cases, among the highest tallies in Latin America. The hardest hit regions of capital Santiago, a city of 6 million, are posh, high-end neighborhoods at the foot of the Andes Mountains. Quarantine measures in many of those normally bustling communities require residents to shelter in place. \u201cWhat is going to be tested this weekend is how responsible, how supportive, we are as Chileans,\u201d Blumel said. \u201cStaying at home is not only an obligation, it is a moral and ethical duty.\u201d Chilean health officials said earlier this week they planned to cordon off the city, setting up road checkpoints manned by police and military, to prevent city dwellers from fleeing to second homes in rural areas at the risk of spreading the virus. But Santiago mayor Felipe Guevara told state television the city had received complaints \u201cthat people are using their own or leased helicopter or aircraft to leave the metropolitan region for their second home.\u201d Guevara said aviation officials would ask tough questions of any pilot seeking to leave the city. The UK\u2019s housing secretary Robert Jenrick has responded on Twitter to The Guardian\u2019s story about him visiting his parents. Egypt reported 139 new cases of coronavirus, bringing its total since the start of the outbreak to 1,699, according to a health ministry statement. The Arab world\u2019s most populous country also recorded 15 new deaths, raising the total number to 118. Reacting to the news that Boris Johnson has left intensive care and returned to a ward, Dr Tom Wingfield, senior clinical lecturer and honorary consultant physician at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said: \u201cBeing well enough to leave intensive care is a really encouraging sign that a patient is improving clinically. \u201cIt means that they no longer need specialist ICU care, which includes continuous monitoring and, in some cases, a ventilator. \u201cThey may still require close monitoring on a ward. Close monitoring means regular measurement of \u2018vital signs\u2019 like blood pressure, pulse rate, breathing rate, and oxygen levels, and also clinical review by doctors, nurses, and other health and social care professionals. \u201cEvery patient is different and the time it takes for them to be fit enough to be discharged from hospital or recover to full health can vary widely. Nevertheless, leaving ICU is an extremely important first step on their road to recovery.\u201d Iran\u2019s supreme leader suggested that mass gatherings may be barred through the Muslim holy month of Ramadan amid the coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, Amnesty International said it believes at least 35 Iranian prisoners were killed by security forces suppressing riots by inmates over the virus. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei made the comments in a televised address as Iran prepares to restart its economic activity. \u201cWe are going to be deprived of public gatherings of the month of Ramadan\u201d Khamenei said. \u201cIn the absence of these meetings, remember to heed your prayers and devotions in your lonesomeness.\u201d Ramadan is scheduled to begin in late April and last through most of May. The UK\u2019s foreign secretary Dominic Raab has tweeted his joy that prime minister Boris Johnson has been moved out of intensive care. From our Latin America correspondent Tom Phillips: Rio de Janeiro\u2019s governor @wilsonwitzel has tweeted out this photograph of a coronavirus field hospital being built beside one of the world\u2019s most iconic football stadiums, the Maracan\u00e3. The Maracan\u00e3 - which has hosted two World Cup finals, in 1950 and 2014 - is one of two major Brazilian stadiums being converted into Covid-19 field hospitals as the country braces for a big increase in coronavirus cases. The other is S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Pacaembu which has been turned into a 200-bed clinic for coronavirus patients who do not require intensive care treatment. So far Brazil has recorded 16,238 cases and 824 deaths although low testing rates mean the true figures are likely to be much higher. Most cases have been concentrated in southeastern Brazil, of which both Rio and S\u00e3o Paulo are part. Other Brazilian cities turning football stadiums into hospitals include Boa Vista in the Amazon state of Roraima and Fortaleza in northeast Brazil. The US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said on Thursday that the American economy could start to reopen for business in May, reports Reuters, despite experts\u2019 emphasis on prolonged physical distancing measures to defeat the coronavirus. Asked on CNBC whether he thought Donald Trump could reopen the economy so soon, Mnuchin said: \u201cI do.\u201d \u201cAs soon as the president feels comfortable with the medical issues, we are making everything necessary that American companies and American workers can be open for business.\u201d Boris Johnson is out of intensive care but the UK prime minister remains in hospital with coronavirus. South Africa\u2019s president, Cyril Ramaphosa has announced the country\u2019s coronavirus lockdown will be extended by a further two weeks. He had imposed a 21-day lockdown on the country\u2019s 56 million inhabitants on 27 March, enforced by the police and the army. Pope Francis presided at a scaled-down Holy Thursday Mass in an empty St Peter\u2019s Basilica, praising ordinary doctors, nurses and priests who risk their lives helping coronavirus victims as \u201cthe saints next door\u201d. The mass usually packs the basilica with up to 10,000 people, including cardinals, bishops and locals. But because of coronavirus restrictions, Pope Francis spoke from a secondary altar behind the main one he normally uses and the occasion was attended by only two dozen people, including a few aides, nuns and a scaled-down choir. The pope said: \u201cThese days more than 60 (priests) have died here in Italy while taking care of the sick, in hospitals. \u201cTogether with the doctors and nurses they are the saints next door.\u201d Meanwhile, Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli will sing at the Duomo cathedral in Milan bare of worshippers on Easter Sunday. He told Reuters: \u201cThe Duomo will be completely empty. This, on its own, already makes the situation abnormal. \u201cBut in this case, and I repeat, as this won\u2019t be a concert and it won\u2019t be a performance, it will be a prayer and as a consequence it will not be important who is present physically but rather who wants to be with me spiritually in that moment.\u201d Bocelli will be accompanied only by the cathedral organist, Emanuele Vianelli, playing one of world\u2019s largest pipe organs and performing a repertoire of sacred works including Pietro Mascagni\u2019s Sancta Maria. The UK prime minister has been moved out of intensive care, Downing Street said. A spokesman for Johnson said: \u201cThe prime minister has been moved this evening from intensive care back to the ward, where he will receive close monitoring during the early phase of his recovery. \u201cHe is in extremely good spirits.\u201d For more, visit our UK blog: The UK\u2019s weekly nationwide applause for NHS workers will take place at 8pm UK time. France has said the total death toll in hospitals and nursing homes has risen to 12,210, from 10,869 on Wednesday, Reuters is reporting. The number of confirmed cases in hospitals has increased to 86,334 today from 82,048 on Wednesday, while 30,767 are in hospital with the virus. The World Health Organisation reports that there have now been 1,202 cases confirmed in Iraq, and that 69 people have died from the disease there, while 425 have so far recovered. According to the latest situation report from the country published by the UN\u2019s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, about a quarter of the cases are in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) and the remainder are in federal Iraq. The Iraqi government has extended curfews and movement restrictions in federal Iraq until 18 April, and the Kurdistan regional government has extended curfews and movement restrictions until 10 April. Like many other poorer regions of the world, Iraq has a shortage of chemicals for coronavirus testing kits, the WHO reported. It said it had collaborated with scientists at Basrah university to manufacture some substances domestically, and that local production of disinfectants and hand sanitiser had also been stepped up. The World Food Programme reported surges in the prices of foods and other commodities, the OCHA report said. According to the report: Social distancing measures such as mandatory movement restrictions are reducing the economic activity in the country, which negatively impacts the most vulnerable groups such as day labourers and low-income workers. Nearly all governorates reported price increases in food items; approximately half reported price hikes in hygiene items, while three reported increases in fuel prices. Significant price spikes were observed during the last two weeks of March. That\u2019s it from me, Damien Gayle, until tomorrow. The global death toll has passed 90,000 on the Johns Hopkins University tracker \u2013 the current figure is 90,057. The US has now overtaken Spain with 15,774 deaths. Spain has 15,238, according to the Maryland-based university\u2019s research. Italy is the country with the highest coronavirus-related deaths at 17,669. https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html Despite claims to the contrary by Donald Trump, the World Health Organization warned the US and other countries about the risk of human-to-human transmission of Covid-19 as early as 10 January, and urged precautions even though initial Chinese studies at that point had found no clear evidence of that route of infection, write Peter Beaumont in London and Julian Borger in Washington. Technical guidance notes seen by the Guardian and briefings by top WHO officials warned of potential human-to-human transmission and made clear that there was a threat of catching the disease through water droplets and contaminated surfaces, based on the experience of earlier coronavirus outbreaks. In recent days, Trump has attempted to blame the WHO for the pandemic, pointing to a WHO tweet on 14 January saying \u201cthere was no human-to-human transmission\u201d. \u201cIn many ways, they were wrong. They also minimised the threat very strongly,\u201d the US president said, before threatening to cut funding to the organisation. Trump supporters have been calling for the resignation of the WHO\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , and for a congressional investigation of the body\u2019s performance. Why are coronavirus mortality rates so different? How can we understand the risk of dying from Covid-19 when there are so many numbers flying around? There are actually three types of fatality rate, which are calculated in different ways and tell you different things. When we know what each means and how they work, we can learn more about how new infections such as the coronavirus affect us, the Guardian\u2019s video team reports. New York broke its record for the largest single-day coronavirus death toll for the third consecutive day, the state\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, announced at his daily briefing. New York recorded 799 deaths from coronavirus yesterday, bringing the state\u2019s total death toll to 7,067. New York has lost about the same number of people to coronavirus as the UK. Cuomo said the state would be bringing in additional funeral directors to help deal with the surge of deaths. As the state mourns the loss of several thousand New Yorkers, there are also signs that social distancing is flattening the curve. Yesterday, the state recorded the lowest number of new hospitalisations since the crisis started. The number of ICU admissions and intubations are also down. \u201cWe are saving lives by what we are doing today,\u201d Cuomo said. Read more updates from the US on our US coronavirus live blog. A hospital consultant who wrote a public plea to the UK prime minister for more personal protective equipment for frontline staff in British hospitals has died from the coronavirus, Matthew Weaver reports. Abdul Mabud Chowdhury, a consultant urologist at Homerton hospital in Hackney east London, died after spending 15 days in Queens hospital, Romford. Last month he wrote a Facebook message to Boris Johnson outlining the urgent need for PPE for frontline staff and calling for testing for healthcare workers to be fast-tracked. He wrote: \u201cDear and respectable prime minister Mr Boris Johnson, Please ensure urgently PPE for each and every NHS health worker.\u201d The coronavirus crisis is not a \u201cblank cheque\u201d to flout civil liberties, the UN human rights commissioner warned on Thursday as she criticised some states\u2019 adoption of \u201cunlimited\u201d emergency powers, AFP reports. Addressing the first-ever virtual meeting of the United Nations human rights council in Geneva, Michelle Bachelet said: Emergency measures may well be needed to respond to this public health emergency. But an emergency situation is not a blank cheque to disregard human rights obligations Emergency measures should be necessary and proportionate. I am profoundly concerned by certain countries\u2019 adoption of emergency powers that are unlimited. The World Health Organization has reported a drastic shortage of intensive care beds to treat Covid-19 patients in Africa, where it estimates there are only around five per million people, compared with 4,000 per million people in Europe. As the WHO\u2019s Africa branch reported a spread of the coronavirus beyond urban centres, officials insisted containment was still possible. But they warned of dire consequences if it was not achieved. Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa, said: Tackling cases in rural areas that often lack the resources of urban centres will pose an immense challenge for already strained health systems in Africa. There is a critical shortage of treatment facilities for critical cases of Covid-19 in Africa. As elsewhere in the world, the toll of coronavirus in Africa is concentrated among older people. The WHO reported that according to a preliminary analysis more than half (55%) of reported deaths were of people over 60 years, despite their accounting for only 16% of total cases. Italy\u2019s coronavirus curve has been flattening but is yet to show signs of a definitive decrease as deaths rose by 610 on Thursday, 68 more than on Wednesday, Angela Giuffrida reports. The figures from the civil protection authority showed current infections rose by 1,615, or 1.7%. The overall number of cases, including those who have died or recovered, rose 4,204 (2.9%) to 143,626. The number of intensive care beds in use continues to decline, as does the number of people hospitalised for the virus. Of the 96,877 people currently infected, 64,873 are recovering at home. Italy has registered 143,626 confirmed cases of the virus to date, including 18,279 deaths and 28,470 survivors. Italy\u2019s lockdown is due to expire on 13 April but is likely to be extended by another two weeks. \u2022 This entry was amended on 10 April 2020, to correct the figure regarding current infections, and to add information about the rise in the total number of cases. Around the world people ordered to stay home to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic have turned to online fitness instructors to stay in shape. Now the president of Uganda, Yoweri Museveni, has got in on the act, publishing a video to social media to educate his compatriots about how to work out indoors. The video had been hotly anticipated on social media after Museveni on Wednesday called on Ugandans to stop exercising outdoors in groups and promised to release a video showing them how to get their fitness fix at home. True to his word, Museveni released his two-minute and 25 second instructional video on Facebook and Twitter on Thursday afternoon. Appearing barefoot and wearing a grey tracksuit in a spacious office with a plush red carpet, he tells viewers: It\u2019s good to go outdoors when there is no problem but when there\u2019s a need you can go indoors. This is just an office. Because I don\u2019t have time, I always do my exercises here or even in my home, in my room. \u201cSo you start by warming up,\u201d he says before jogging from one end of the room to the other, increasing his pace and making an effort to keep his knees up. The 75-year-old retired general then begins to do push-ups, placing his hands on a white towel laid on the floor. In the background aides are heard counting 30 push-ups, although the camera cuts away at one point. According to the Uganda Bureau of Statistics 71 percent of people living in the capital, Kampala, share a one-roomed home with several others. Uganda has recorded 53 cases of the coronavirus, and has implemented a 14-day lockdown with transport banned and a nightime curfew, however people are still allowed to move around on foot in groups of less than five. Museveni, who is seeking a sixth term in office next year, has given almost daily briefings on the virus. He has become a hit on social media with his advice, telling landlords they can \u201cdemand their money later\u201d, complaining about security officers who \u201clike beating people\u201d or urging that \u2018this is not the time for exams.\u201d The latest figures are running on our UK-focused coronavirus live blog. As of today, in the UK 243,421 people have been tested for Covid-19. Of them, 65,077 have tested positive and the number of people admitted to hospital with symptoms stands at 16,784. Of those who have contracted the virus 7,978 have died. The president of Botswana, Mokgweetsi Masisi, and 63 of the country\u2019s MPs are to self-isolate after a nurse assigned to screen legislators for coronavirus tested positive for it herself. Health minister Lemogang Kwape told parliament that some legislators at a special session on had interacted with a health worker who later tested positive for the virus. \u201cEveryone who was here has to undergo mandatory quarantine from here,\u201d the director of health services, Malaki Tshipiyagae, announced. This includes Masisi, and all 63 MPs of the ruling and opposition parties. It is the second time in less than a month that Botswana\u2019s leader will have been quarantined. The special session had been called to debate Masisi\u2019s request to extend Botswana\u2019s state of emergency for another six months - one of a slew of measures aimed at curbing the spread of the virus in the diamond-rich country. Parliament gave its approval on Thursday. The landlocked country has announced seven new confirmed cases of coronavirus, bringing the tally to 13, one of whom has died. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary general, has released a statement saying he welcomes the unilateral ceasefire declared by Saudi Arabia over its war in Yemen, which he said he hopes will help the war-torn country handle its coronavirus epidemic I welcome the announcement by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, on behalf of the \u2018Coalition to Support Legitimacy in Yemen\u2019, of a unilateral ceasefire in Yemen. This can help to advance efforts towards peace, as well as the country\u2019s response to the Covid-19 pandemic. I now call upon the Government of Yemen and Ansar Allah to follow through on their commitment to immediately cease hostilities. I also call on the Government and the Houthis to engage with each other, in good faith and without preconditions, in negotiations facilitated by my Special Envoy, Martin Griffiths. Only through dialogue will the parties be able to agree on a mechanism for sustaining a nationwide ceasefire, humanitarian and economic confidence-building measures to alleviate the suffering of the Yemeni people, and the resumption of the political process to reach a comprehensive settlement to end the conflict. After five years of war, Yemen has little civil infrastructure left to manage an outbreak of Covid-19. According to a risk report published yesterday by ACAPS, only 51% of the country\u2019s health centres are fully functional, and there are only three testing sites, with the capacity for a few hundred tests a day at most. Forecasting the potential impact on the country, ACAPS\u2019s report suggests: By the time COVID-19 is identified in Yemen, it will likely be spreading rapidly through the population. While a proportion of cases will be hospitalised, hospitals will struggle to implement sufficient protective measures in COVID-19 treatment wards. This may cause patients with other ailments to decide not to visit healthcare facilities for fear of contracting COVID-19. This post was amended on 15 April 2020 to correct the spelling of the organisation ACAPS. Brazil\u2019s health minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, has admitted authorities will have to deal with drug traffickers and paramilitary gangs as they seek to stop the spread of Covid-19 through the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, Tom Phillips, the Guardian\u2019s Latin America correspondent, reports. Heavily armed criminal gangs control many of the city\u2019s thousand or so favelas, which this week recorded their first coronavirus deaths. And at a press conference on Wednesday, Mandetta conceded his workers would have to talk to them. \u201cHealth authorities do communicate with traffickers and paramilitares, yes, because they are human beings too and they also have to cooperate, help and take part,\u201d said the minister, a doctor who did part of his training in Rio\u2019s favelas. Brazil\u2019s health ministry told one local newspaper the minister\u2019s comments \u2013 in many ways just a statement of the obvious \u2013 were designed to send a message to gang leaders that once the coronavirus began spreading through the densely populated favelas, health workers would have to come in. But the declaration caused outrage among supporters of Brazil\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, with whom the health minister has been sparring over Brazil\u2019s reaction to coronavirus. \u201cHas this guy been smoking crack?\u201d tweeted Edson Salom\u00e3o, one of the founders of a group called Rightwing S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cWTF.\u201d Africa\u2019s top health official has issued a warning to wealthy countries hoarding medical equipment that if the coronavirus is left to spread in Africa the whole world remains at risk. \u201cWe cannot be neglected in this effort,\u201d John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters in a briefing on Thursday. \u201cThe world will be terribly unsafe, and it will be completely naive, if countries think they can control Covid-19 in their countries but not in Africa.\u201d African nations are being forced to compete with wealthier countries for testing kits, as well as ventilators for patients having difficulty breathing and protective equipment for frontline health workers. Nkengasong warned that the very future of the continent will depend on how this matter is handled as cases, now over 11,000, quickly rise. \u201cWe may not actually know how big is the size of the problem without scaling up testing,\u201d Nkengasong was quoted as saying by the Associated Press. Health authorities in Pakistan have reported 250 new confirmed cases of coronavirus, bringing the total in the country to 4,322, the UN\u2019s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported on Thursday. According to OCHA, the most affected province due to Covid-19 virus was Punjab with 2,171 cases, followed by Sindh with 1,036. So far 467 (12%) cases had fully recovered and discharged while 1,139 were currently in hospital, of which 25 were in critical condition. Pakistani English-language newspaper Dawn was reporting 65 deaths across Pakistan since the beginning of the outbreak. It ran higher figures for infections and recoveries on its home page than those given by the UN. The World Health Organization\u2019s top officials in Africa say it\u2019s too early to make an assessment of the impact of lockdowns and other measures across the continent but called for all such restrictions to be accompanied by effective public health measures to be worth their very significant social and economic costs, writes Jason Burke, the Guardian\u2019s African correspondent. The total number of cases in Africa remains relatively low compared to Europe or the US, though the official stats by no means reflect the true spread of the disease. The total this morning was 11,400, with 572 deaths, up from 6,600 a week ago. Almost all countries across Africa have imposed measures to enforce social distancing, ranging from very strict nationwide lockdowns, such as in South Africa and Liberia, to strict measures targeting individual cities, such as in Kenya and Nigeria, or simply closing big gatherings and meetings. But the impact on communities that live in overcrowded neighbourhoods in big African cities, where many people rely on their daily earnings to eat, is massive. It has been compounded by a series of other economic shocks - such as a drastic drop in the amount of cash sent back to families by workers in the Gulf or elsewhere. \u201cThe lockdowns are having a big cost and we really need to work together to make sure they are having an impact,\u201d Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO\u2019s regional director for Africa, told reporters in an online briefing on Thursday. There is some good news, WHO officials said. There has been a lot of progress in ramping up testing capabilities, with pretty much all countries on the continent now theoretically able to test their citizens for the disease. As elsewhere however, there are shortages in the key chemicals needed for the tests, and that\u2019s causing problems. This is particularly true in South Africa, which has the highest number of cases and has adopted a strategy based on aggressive screening and testing to try to stamp out any clusters and outbreaks of the disease before it can spread. Officials in South Africa have yet to decide whether to extend the lockdown in South Africa, now in its third week. Government medical advisors say the decision will depend on whether they can establish a good understanding of the spread of the disease in the coming days. One possibility may be to lift some restrictions but maintain strict rules to limit social distancing, but, they say, nothing is decided. Other governments across the continent will face similar decisions in coming days and weeks. None will be easy, officials say, and the experience of European or Asian countries should not necessarily guide policy in the very different circumstances found in Nairobi, Kinshasa, Juba or Bamako. The International Organization for Migration has issued a call for states to \u201cuphold international obligations\u201d, days after Italy closed its ports in an apparent attempt to block access to boats carrying migrants across the Mediterranean. \u201cMigrants continue to attempt the Mediterranean crossing, fleeing violence, abuse and poverty amid heightened concern over the Covid-19 pandemic,\u201d the IOM said in a statement on Thursday. At least six boats, carrying roughly 500 people, have departed from Libya since the beginning of this month, the IOM said, adding that an NGO vessel that had rescued 150 adrift in the Mediterranean remains at sea \u201cwithout an assigned port of safety\u201d. The organisation\u2019s statement says: International maritime law and human rights obligations must be upheld during the Covid-19 emergency. The crisis should strengthen our collective resolve to preserve life, protect rights and find common, adaptable solutions to the challenges that affect us all. ... We recognise that while many countries have chosen to tighten control at their borders in an effort to contain the spread of the pandemic, it is crucial that such measures be implemented in a non-discriminatory manner, in line with international law, and prioritises the protection of the most vulnerable. On Wednesday, Lorenzo Tondo reported that the Italian government had declared its seaports \u201cunsafe\u201d due to the coronavirus pandemic, and would not authorise the landing of migrant rescue boats until the end of the emergency. The measure \u2013 the first of its kind in Italian history \u2013 appeared designed to prevent rescue boats from disembarking migrants in the upcoming weeks, as departures from Libya have increased in recent days with the arrival of good weather. Kenya has reported five new confirmed cases of coronavirus, bringing the total number of infections so far in the country to 184. Seven patients have died, and 12 have recovered. The health ministry publishes all the details of its latest coronavirus reporting on Twittter. The Canadian death toll from the coronavirus outbreak is likely to be between 11,000 and 22,000 by the end of the pandemic, health officials said on Thursday, outlining the two most likely scenarios. The officials told a briefing that they expected between 500 and 700 people by April 16. The death toll so far is 435, reports Reuters. Health authorities in Singapore on Thursday reported an increase of 287 confirmed cases of coronavirus, double the increase registered a day earlier, with the majority linked to dormitories used to house foreign workers. The latest rise in cases is the biggest reported to date in the south east Asian city state, which was one of the first outside China to detect the virus. It brings the total to 1,910, Straits Times reports. Singapore\u2019s strict surveillance and quarantine regime initially slowed the outbreak, but recent rises in locally transmitted cases have raised fresh concerns, the Guardian reported on Wednesday, as the city reported 142 new infections. Thousands of foreign workers - many of whom work in essential services in the city - are to be moved to army camps, floating hotels and vacant housing blocks, Straits Times reports. This is Damien Gayle taking over the blog again. You can send me tips or news from your area to damien.gayle@theguardian.com, or via Twitter DM to @damiengayle. The latest numbers from Johns Hopkins University, which has tracked the spread of the virus during the pandemic, now puts the confirmed global total of cases at 1,502,618. A record one million Canadians lost their jobs in March from the coronavirus pandemic, the country\u2019s statistical agency said on Thursday. The previous benchmark for monthly job losses in Canada was set in January 2009 when 125,000 jobs disappeared, reports Leyland Cecco from Toronto. In its monthly Labour Force Survey, Statistics Canada said the country\u2019s unemployment rate jumped more than 2.2 percent to 7.8%. Economists, and the prime minister, had warned the numbers would be grim. Justin Trudeau said on Wednesday: It\u2019s going to be a hard day for the country. We\u2019re facing a unique challenge. But I know that if we pull together our economy will come roaring back after this crisis. Ontario experienced the largest job losses, with 403,000 losing their jobs. Quebec lost 264,000 jobs and British Columbia lost 132,000. Trudeau\u2019s government has scrambled in recent weeks to help out-of-work Canadians, including a monthly benefit of $2,000 for residents who have lost jobs due to the virus. More than 5 million Canadians have so far applied for the programme, suggesting the scope of job losses are deeper than anticipated and renewing fears that April\u2019s job losses will exceed the unprecedented numbers posted in March. Germany\u2019s army is donating 60 mobile ventilators free of charge to the UK following a call for help as the NHS scrambles to get hold of enough life-saving equipment as the Covid-19 pandemic intensifies. Speaking to the Guardian, a spokesperson for the German defence ministry confirmed a report in Der Spiegel, according to which the Bundeswehr would send 60 pieces of equipment from its own depot across the Channel as soon as possible. The German ministry said it would not invoice the UK for the ventilators. More than 480 ventilators are understood to have arrived in the UK from overseas since March. They have been bought or donated from China, US, Germany, Sweden and Taiwan. The pandemic will turn global economic growth \u201csharply negative\u201d in 2020, triggering the worst fallout since the 1930s Great Depression, with only a partial recovery seen in 2021, the head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said. Kristalina Georgieva said the crisis would hit emerging markets and developing countries hardest of all, which would need hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign aid, Reuters reports. Georgieva said: Just three months ago, we expected positive per capita income growth in over 160 of our member countries in 2020. Today, that number has been turned on its head: we now project that over 170 countries will experience negative per capita income growth this year.\u201d If the pandemic faded in the second half of the year, the IMF expected a partial recovery in 2021, Georgieva said, but she warned the situation could also get worse. I stress there is tremendous uncertainty about the outlook: it could get worse depending on many variable factors, including the duration of the pandemic.\u201d Some African countries could see a peak in coronavirus cases in the coming weeks, and testing should be urgently increased in the region, World Health Organization (WHO) officials said on Thursday. Michel Yao, the WHO Africa programme manager for emergency response, told a media teleconference on Thursday: During the last four days we can see that the numbers have already doubled. If the trend continues, and also learning from what happened in China and in Europe, some countries may face a huge peak very soon.\u201d The numbers of people recorded as infected with the coronavirus in Africa have been relatively low so far, with nearly 11,000 cases and 562 deaths, according to a Reuters tally based on government statements and WHO data. The WHO\u2019s Africa head, Matshidiso Moeti, said there was an \u201curgent need\u201d to expand testing capacity beyond capital cities in Africa, as the virus spreads through countries. Good afternoon, I\u2019m taking over the live blog for the next hour. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter to share insight or send tips, I\u2019m on @Gregoryjourno or send me an email at gregory.robinson@guardian.co.uk What happens if you are in hospital with the coronavirus? In this video, the Guardian\u2019s health editor, Sarah Boseley, explains the different ways coronavirus can affect people, the likelihood of going to hospital and what will happen to people who are admitted. More than 6.6 million Americans lost their jobs last week, taking the total to 16 million job losses in the last three weeks as the coronavirus pandemic brings the US economy to a standstill, the US labor department confirmed on Thursday, writes Dominic Rushe in New York and Michael Sainato in Florida. About 6.6 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week as shutdowns across the US led employers to furlough workers in nearly every corner of the job market. Economists had expected 5.25 million Americans to file for unemployment benefits for the week ending 4 April. Layoffs that started in the restaurant and leisure industries have now spread to manufacturing, construction and even healthcare. Job losses are rising in every state and economists are predicting the unemployment rate will soon reach 15% or higher, levels unseen since before the second world war. The latest snapshot of economic devastation wrought by Covid-19 came as the virus itself continued its relentless spread. More than 86,000 deaths have been reported around the world and the US has over 432,000 confirmed cases, the most of any nation. But while the numbers are stark, economists cautioned it was too early to say what the long-term impact of Covid-19 will be on the economy. I don\u2019t know about your part of the world, but where I live in London has seen an explosion in the number of joggers and cyclists on the streets as people use their officially sanctioned single outing a day to get some exercise. Many countries around the world have made daily exercise one of the few exceptions to strict lockdowns intended to curb the spread of coronavirus. But what if your daily jog, cycle, or even walk, with sanctioned fellow runners, cyclists or walkers could actually put people at greater danger of catching the disease? That\u2019s what new research by a team of Dutch and Belgian researchers has found. They are warning that existing social distancing advice does not account for the increased potential spread of the virus in aerosol droplets that catch in the slipstream of heavily breathing runners and cyclists. In a white paper made freely available online by lead researcher Bert Blocken, professor of civil engineering at Eindhoven University of Technology, they say: Walking, running or cycling are welcome activities to ease one\u2019s mind in times of Covid\u201019. But it is best not to exercise these outdoor sports in each other\u2019s slipstream, according to recent research by Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands and KU Leuven in Belgium. While the official advice to remain a specified distance away from other individuals outside your household works indoors, or in calm weather, Blocken says: If someone exhales, coughs or sneezes while walking, running or cycling, most of the microdroplets are entrained in the wake or slipstream behind the runner or cyclist. The other person who runs or cycles just behind this leading person in the slipstream then moves through that cloud of droplets. The slipstream is the zone that arises right behind a person when they are walking or cycling, and which pulls the air a bit along with this moving person, as it were. Cyclists like to position themselves in the slipstream of others to reduce their air resistance. But someone who walks or runs also has such a slipstream. We have seen that no matter how that zone forms, droplets end up in that air stream. So it\u2019s best to avoid that slipstream. Blocken has made a couple of video animations and posted them on Twitter to illustrate what he means. A note of caution: Blocken admits that his team\u2019s findings are not peer reviewed. But, he adds: \u201cGiven the situation, we decided it would be unethical to keep the results confidential and keep the public waiting months for the peer review process to be completed.\u201d He says that full details of the scientific study will be posted as a LinkedIn article. The UK government has given an update on the condition of the prime minister, Boris Johnson, who spent his third night in intensive care last night after falling ill with Covid-19, Rowena Mason reports. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said Johnson continues to receive standard oxygen treatment, adding: Boris Johnson had a good night and continues to improve in intensive care at St Thomas\u2019s hospital. He is in good spirits. The number of people killed by the coronavirus in Spain passed 15,000 on Thursday, but the daily death toll fell to 683 after two consecutive days of rising above 740, Sam Jones reports from Madrid. Figures released by the health department suggest that the spread of the virus is continuing to slow down: between Wednesday and Thursday, the rise in the number of new cases was 3.9%, compared with a daily average of 12% at the end of March and 20% in mid-March. To date, Spain has confirmed 152,336 cases of the virus, and 15,238 deaths. However, there are growing doubts over the way in which the country is counting the dead. Recently released data from judicial authorities in Madrid suggest that 6,600 more people than usual died in the last two weeks of March, compared with the official tally of 3,500 Covid-19 deaths in the region. Spain\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, is once again seeking Congress\u2019s approval to extend the state of emergency \u2013 this time until 26 April. Speaking in parliament on Thursday morning, he defended his government\u2019s handling of the Covid-19 crisis and said the continuing lockdown, which has been in effect since 14 March, was the best way to tackle contagion. He said: We\u2019re all aware of the enormous sacrifice that this second extension requires from people who, quite logically, are fed up with the efforts of the past month. But we also know that it\u2019s vitally important that we consolidate all the advances that have been made with so much pain and suffering over that time. And that\u2019s something we\u2019ll only manage to do if we maintain the state of emergency for as long as scientists consider it necessary. A group of doctors in Zimbabwe have taken their government to court over its failure to provide medical staff working on the frontline of the Covid-19 pandemic with masks, Nyasha Chingono reports from Harare. The Zimbabwe Association for Doctors for Human Rights (ZADHR) is seeking to compel the authorities to urgently provide personal protective equipment for medical practitioners, warning that medics in the troubled health sector will otherwise die. \u201cThere are simply no adequate PPEs for health personnel working at public and private health facilities in the country. We attest to the shortages because we work there,\u201d read the court application, seen by the Guardian. \u201cIf no urgent steps are taken to address the shortcomings, the country will be caught unprepared to handle a possible escalation of the Covid-19 pandemic and many lives will be lost, sadly including the lives of those at the frontline.\u201d ZADHR said 1,500 staff working in public hospitals required at least three masks daily, a \u201cluxury\u201d the government was failing to provide. \u201cYet it is a necessity if we are to avert the Italian disaster, where a large number of health practitioners got infected through the provision of health services to patients,\u201d the statement said. According to Reuters, Zimbabwe had reported 11 confirmed cases of coronavirus and three deaths by Thursday. Food supplies across the world will be \u201cmassively disrupted\u201d by the coronavirus, and unless governments act the number of people suffering chronic hunger could double, some of the world\u2019s biggest food companies have warned, writes Fiona Harvey, the Guardian\u2019s environment correspondent. Unilever, Nestl\u00e9 and PepsiCo, along with farmers\u2019 organisations, the UN Foundation, academics, and civil society groups, have written to world leaders, calling on them to keep borders open to trade in order to help society\u2019s most vulnerable, and to invest in environmentally sustainable food production. They urge governments to \u201ctake urgent coordinated action to prevent the Covid-19 pandemic turning into a global food and humanitarian crisis\u201d. Maintaining open trade will be key, as will investing in food supply chains and protecting farmers in the developed and developing world, they say. The G20 is coming under increasing pressure to act: a group of Nobel prize-winning economists and former senior development bank officials wrote to the forum advising that trillions of dollars would be needed to help the developing world cope with the Covid-19 pandemic. This week more than 100 former heads of government, including Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and Nicolas Sarkozy, also called on the G20 to act urgently or risk recurrent outbreaks. For a republic that dispatched most of its own royal family to the guillotine 227 years ago, the French have an enduring fascination with the British monarchy, writes Kim Willsher in Paris. The Queen\u2019s speech on Sunday was broadcast live on three television news networks with simultaneous translation and followed by 2.35 million viewers an estimated 8.6% of the watching public, according to the media observatory, M\u00e9diam\u00e9trie. BFMTV reported its audience rose by more than half a million viewers for the speech. St\u00e9phane Bern, France\u2019s leading royal expert, wrote in Le Figaro that the Queen\u2019s speech had \u201cmoved not just the British nation\u201d. She is a symbolic figure. When we say \u201cthe Queen\u201d we immediately think of the \u201cQueen of England\u201d. She is a kind of mater dolorosa (sorrowful mother: a reference to the image of the Virgin Mary holding a dying Jesus), the soul of the nation. Bern was particularly impressed by the queen\u2019s \u201chumility\u201d in thanking NHS and other frontline workers. \u201cI found her very elegant. She was taking a back seat, unlike the politicians,\u201d Bern said. In another interview, Bern added the Queen had \u201cunderscored British values of calm, camaraderie and self-discipline\u201d. She is like a rock in a storm, here we have a woman who has reigned for 68 years and who will soon be 94 years old, who has known the war...and made reference to it. The fondness of older French people for the monarch, always referred to as \u201cLa Reine d\u2019Angleterre\u201d (the Queen of England), has been transmitted to a younger generation via the hugely popular Netflix series, The Crown. This fascination has been widely documented in the French media. In 2016, Adela\u00efde de Clermont-Tonnerre, a French editor, said she was astonished to hear people shouting \u201cLong live the Queen\u201d, when Elizabeth II visited Paris in 2014. A second person has died from Covid-19 in Malta, where the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus currently stands at 299. The Maltese health ministry said the 79-year-old, who had underlying health conditions, had been receiving care at the Karin Grech hospital after first testing positive for the coronavirus on Monday, the Times of Malta reports. A 92-year-old woman became Malta\u2019s first Covid-19 death on Wednesday. People over the age of 65 and people with underlying health conditions have been warned to remain indoors and only to leave their homes to buy food. The number of new infections continued to rise in Afghanistan on Thursday, as thousands of migrants poured back from Pakistan amid a surge of infections in Kandahar, Akhtar Mohammad Makoii reports from Herat. Health officials reported 40 new coronavirus cases recorded in last 24 hours, bringing the total number in the country to 484. However, due to a lack of some testing materials, no suspected patients were tested for a second straight day in Herat. As of Tuesday the number of infections was 257 in Afghanistan\u2019s worst affected area. Local health officials said the materials arrived in Herat on Thursday afternoon and the process will restart soon. A health ministry spokesman warned that the virus has now spread into the society and most of the new infections have no history of travel to Iran. All three provinces which have border with Iran are under partial curfew in a bid to contain the spread of the virus. But with streets still packed with vehicles and people walking freely around, experts warn that fighting the outbreak will be challenging. The country\u2019s capital, Kabul, is the second most affected city with 95 positive cases \u2013 10 confirmed in the last 24 hours. The city went under full lockdown on Wednesday. Health workers and food suppliers, media workers, security officials and telecom services employees are exempt, the interior ministry said on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Pakistan opened its border with Afghanistan for three days and thousands of Afghan migrants returned, mostly to Kandahar, raising concerns in the province as the number of infections rose to 30. Afghanistan has so far recorded 15 deaths of Covid-19, while 32 patients have recovered. Indonesia has reported its biggest daily increase in confirmed cases of coronavirus since officially reporting its first last month, Reuters reports. The health ministry official Achmad Yurianto on Thursday announced 337 new infections had been detected in the past 24 hours, taking the total in the world\u2019s most populous Muslim-majority country to 3,293. He reported 40 new deaths linked to the virus, taking the total Covid-19 death toll to 280. According to a report by Rebecca Ratcliffe, the Guardian\u2019s south-east Asia correspondent, on Wednesday Indonesia\u2019s government announced the closure of schools and workplaces in the capital, Jakarta, where a sudden rise in burials has raised concerns over undetected cases. President Joko Widodo had previously resisted lockdown measures imposed in many other south-east Asian nations, but there are fears infections are not being spotted by authorities. Wednesday marked the 100th day since China, on 31 December 2019, first reported cases of pneumonia caused by a then unknown coronavirus to the World Health Organization. Since then there have been more than 1.3m confirmed cases, and more than 75,000 deaths. Billions of people are confined to their homes and stock markets have plummeted The Guardian\u2019s visuals team has put together an interactive graphic showing how the pandemic has spread across the globe, from the very beginnings of the outbreak in Wuhan. It\u2019s worth a look. Bangladesh has imposed a \u201ccomplete lockdown\u201d in its Cox\u2019s Bazaar district, which is home to over a million Rohingya refugees from neighbouring Myanmar. The area \u201cwill be put under complete lockdown \u2013 no entry, no exit \u2013 until the situation improves,\u201d a government directive issued late on Wednesday said, according to AFP. No cases have been confirmed in the camps but one infection has been recorded nearby. The consequences of an outbreak in Cox\u2019s Bazaar are potentially catastrophic. Earlier this week, Save the Children reported that the district, which is home to a total of 3.3 million people, does not have a single ventilator to treat patients with severe Covid-19 symptoms. The official number of coronavirus cases in Bangladesh doubled to more than 200 nationwide in the last five days, including 20 deaths. There are reportedly 1,769 ventilators in place or in the pipeline in Bangladesh, a country of 165 million people. The United Nations secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, has issued a statement in support of the World Health Organization, after it came under attack from critics, including the US president, who claimed it was in hock to China. Guterres\u2019s statement comes after WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, gave a spirited defence of the work of the WHO, and himself, in response to questions from journalists during a press briefing yesterday. Donald Trump had said on Twitter that the WHO \u201creally blew it\u201d adding that the organisation was \u201cfor some reason, funded largely by the United States, yet very China centric\u201d. Responding to the row in a statement published online, Guterres praised the \u201ccourage and determination\u201d of WHO staff, and added: It is my belief that the World Health Organization must be supported, as it is absolutely critical to the world\u2019s efforts to win the war against Covid-19. This virus is unprecedented in our lifetime and requires an unprecedented response. Obviously, in such conditions, it is possible that the same facts have had different readings by different entities. Once we have finally turned the page on this epidemic, there must be a time to look back fully to understand how such a disease emerged and spread its devastation so quickly across the globe, and how all those involved reacted to the crisis. The lessons learned will be essential to effectively address similar challenges, as they may arise in the future. But now is not that time. Now is the time for unity, for the international community to work together in solidarity to stop this virus and its shattering consequences. The official death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in Iran has passed 4,000, the country\u2019s health ministry reported on Thursday, after 117 more people were confirmed to have died from the disease in the past 24 hours. Kianoush Jahanpour, the health ministry spokesman, said the total death toll in the Islamic republic was now 4,110, while 32,309 had recovered, according to the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA). In total, the country has reported 66,220 confirmed cases since its outbreak \u2013 the worst so far in the Middle East \u2013 began. Of those, 3,918 people are still in a critical condition, Jahanpour said. He added that 231,393 tests have so far been carried out. The latest death toll from Iran comes as its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, on Thursday appealed for Iranians to help stop the spread of the coronavirus by staying at home to pray during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. \u201cIn the absence of public gatherings during Ramadan, such as prayers, speeches ... which we are deprived of this year, we should not neglect worship, invocation and humility in our loneliness,\u201d AFP reported him as saying in a televised speech. Here\u2019s a roundup of global coronavirus news over the last few hours. That\u2019s it from me, Amy Walker. I\u2019ll be handing over to my colleague Damien Gayle now. Italy may begin to lift current lockdown measures by the end of April. The prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, told the BBC that some restrictions could be relaxed if the spread of the disease continued to slow. On Wednesday, there were 542 coronavirus-related deaths in Italy, compared with 604 the previous day. Concern is growing in China over asymptomatic cases of Covid-19. According to the People\u2019s Daily, a state council body has ordered reporting and monitoring of those not showing symptoms despite carrying the virus to be stepped up. The Spanish prime minister has said the country\u2019s latest coronavirus data is \u201cencouraging\u201d. Pedro S \u00e1nchez told parliament on Thursday: \u201cThe fire starts to come under control.\u201d The country has the second highest number of global cases. Indian and Pakistani troops continue to fight over disputed Kashmir, despite surging coronavirus outbreaks. Data from the Indian army shows there were 411 ceasefire violations by Pakistan\u2019s military in March, compared with 467 in the same month last year. The UK and Ireland are expected to extend current lockdown measures over the Easter weekend. It comes as deaths in the countries continue to grow. The US senate has asked its members not to use the videoconferencing app Zoom over security concerns. The app has experienced a surge in usage after lockdown measures were put in place around the world, but concerns have been raised about its lack of end-to-end encryption and uninvited guests crashing meetings. Hi there, this is Damien Gayle taking control of the international live blog for the next eight hours or so. I\u2019ll be focusing on Europe, Africa and the Middle East as countries across the region report their latest death tolls and infection figures, any changes in the measures and policies to control the spread of the coronavirus, and the particular issues faced by their peoples. As usual I will be hoping to hear from readers with any tips, suggestions or news that you think we have overlooked. Please drop me a line at damien.gayle@theguardian.com, or via direct message to my Twitter profile, @damiengayle. If you are sending me news to report on the blog it is helpful if you provide a link or two so that I can source it. The number of daily coronavirus-related deaths in Spain slowed on Thursday as 683 fatalities were recorded in 24 hours. The total of people who have succumbed to the virus now stands at 15,238, the health ministry said. Confirmed infections across the country rose to 152,446 from 146,690 on Wednesday. Scientists and politicians in Germany have this morning presented some fascinating preliminary findings of a forensic study of the outbreak in the Heinsberg municipality on the Dutch border, which has been called \u201cGermany\u2019s Wuhan\u201d. For the \u201cCovid-19 case cluster study\u201d, scientists from the University of Bonn went back to the town that had the first two fatalities from the virus in Germany and interviewed and tested 1,000 residents. Researchers are also trying to work out exactly how the virus got transmitted at a carnival event in the area on 15 February. After analysing around half of the tests, the study\u2019s director, Prof Hendrick Streeck, said on Thursday morning that 14% of the population in the area had developed immunity after contracting the coronavirus. Previous estimated had put the infection rate at only around 5%. Streeck said the fatality case rate of the virus in the area had also turned out to be considerably lower than the currently currently registered for the country as a whole. In Heinsberg, only 0.37% of people who contracted the virus had died. The latest figure for Germany as a whole, as calculated by Johns Hopkins University, is 1.98%. Indian and Pakistani troops in Kashmir are locked in cross-border fighting over the disputed region, despite surging coronavirus outbreaks. Indian army data reviewed by Reuters shows there were 411 ceasefire violations by Pakistan\u2019s military in March, the highest number in a single month since at least 2018. In comparison, 267 violations in March 2019 were recorded by the Indian Army. Kashmir has long been a source of conflict between the neighbours, but tension has grown after Delhi withdrew its autonomy last August, splitting it into federally administered territories. Both countries claim the region in full, but rule only parts of it. Meanwhile in Poland, some measures to curb the spread of Covid-19 will be lifted after Easter, its deputy health minister has suggested. During a news conference, Waldemar Kraska, said some restrictions would be eased in order to support the country\u2019s economy. Poland\u2019s schools, hotels, restaurants, shopping malls and cinemas are currently closed as part of the restrictions. Economists predict that the economy will shrink by 3.5% in 2020, triggering a steep rise in unemployment from the current level of 5.5%. \u201cAfter Easter we will want to turn on the economy a little,\u201d said Kraska. As of Thursday, 5,341 people had tested positive for the virus, while 164 had died in the country. On Monday, Poland\u2019s ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party pushed through measures allowing its presidential election to go ahead in May by postal vote. Restrictions to slow the spread of coronavirus in Ireland could remain in place for a period of weeks, its health minister has said. Citizens were ordered to stay at home on 27 March until at least this Sunday. But Simon Harris told broadcaster Virgin Media it was \u201chighly likely\u201d that the restrictions will be extended tomorrow. He added that Ireland would have to move on to a \u201cdifferent terrain\u201d after that. \u201cIn relation to the roadmap, there is going to be a point in this country where we will have to live alongside the virus, for want of a better phrase, where sadly people will still get sick and sadly some people will still die but it is at a rate that is sustainable for our doctors to manage,\u201d said Harris. Italy may start to lift current lockdown restrictions by the end of April if the spread of the disease in the country continues to slow. Prime minister Giuseppe Conte told the BBC on Thursday: We need to pick sectors that can restart their activity. If scientists confirm it, we might begin to relax some measures already by the end of this month. He warned that restrictions would only be eased gradually, adding that Italy could not lower its guard to the threat of the virus. On Wednesday, there were 542 coronavirus-related deaths in Italy, lower than 604 the previous day. The death toll now stands at 17,669. The number of people in intensive care also declined from 3,792 to 3,693. Russia has reported a record one-day rise of 1,459 new cases of Covid-19, bringing its national total to 10,131. The number of reported related deaths also increased by 13 to 76 on Thursday, the national coronavirus crisis response centre said. China is showing increasing concern over asymptomatic cases of Covid-19, ordering closer monitoring and reporting of \u201csilent\u201d carriers of the virus. According to a report in the People\u2019s Daily, a State Council body has issued directions that screening for such cases \u2013 where people are diagnosed with Covid-19 and are infective even though they develop no symptoms \u2013 must be stepped up. Close contacts of confirmed cases, people involved in cluster outbreaks, and travellers from high-risk areas should all be targeted, the report said. It said medical institutions were now ordered to report such infections online to disease control departments within two hours of detection, and an epidemiological survey completed within 24 hours. The survey includes an investigation of the patient\u2019s contacts. China has only been including asymptomatic cases in its daily tallies this month. They are an estimated 18-31% of cases, according to Shanghai-based infectious disease doctor Zhang Wenhong. The US senate has told members not to use video conferencing app Zoom over security concerns, the Financial Times reports. Senators have been asked to find an alternative platform to aid remote working, according to a person who told the FT that they had seen the warning. However, the senate is believed to have stopped short of imposing an official ban on Zoom Video Communications Inc\u2019s services. Usage of the app has skyrocketed after lockdown measures were put in place around the world, meaning that millions of people are unable to see their loved ones, and many are working from home. But the influx of users has raised concerns about issues including its lack of end-to-end encryption and uninvited guests joining meetings. The latest coronavirus data from Spain is \u201cencouraging\u201d and the country is close to the beginning of a decline in the epidemic, its prime minister has said. \u201cThe fire starts to come under control,\u201d Pedro S\u00e1nchez told parliament on Thursday. His comments came before a vote on the extension of a state of emergency by another two weeks until 26 April. More from our project marking 100 days since the Chinese government first warned the world about the new coronavirus. My colleagues Laurence Topham and Katie Lamborn have compacted the last three months into a whirlwind eight-minute video charting the development of the pandemic: A hundred days after a Chinese government website announced the discovery of a \u201cpneumonia of unknown cause\u201d, it has become clearer that the dynamics behind the virus\u2019s rapid expansion across the globe have relied heavily on \u201ccluster effects\u201d. Each of the countries most heavily hit by the pandemic have reported similar stories of social, cultural or religious gatherings where large numbers spent numerous hours in close company \u2013 holding hands, kissing, sharing drinks from the same glass \u2013 which then turbo-charged the spread of the pandemic. \u201cOne pattern we are seeing across the globe is that wherever there was singing and dancing, the virus spread more rapidly,\u201d said Prof Hendrik Streeck, a virologist at the University of Bonn whose team of researchers has spent the last week carrying out the first \u201cCovid-19 case cluster study\u201d in Heinsberg. You can read more on how social gatherings became rocket fuel for Covid-19 below: The UK government\u2019s emergency committee is scheduled to meet today to discuss the coronavirus lockdown. Dominic Raab, who is deputising for prime minister Boris Johnson while he remains in intensive care with the virus, will lead the COBRA summit ahead of an April 16 deadline to review the current restrictions. But government sources have made it clear the lockdown is likely to be extended. On Thursday morning, culture secretary Oliver Dowden told Sky News: \u201cWe are beginning to make progress on this, we\u2019ve not seen the acceleration you would have expected had we not introduced this, the curve is beginning to flatten. \u201cThis is the moment that we need to stick to the path we\u2019ve chosen. \u201cThe British people have really come behind this, we shouldn\u2019t be giving up this Easter weekend, that is the number one thing.\u201d The UK\u2019s daily death toll is nearing that of the highest daily figures reported in hard-hit Italy and Spain. On Wednesday, 938 fatalities were announced, bringing the total to 7,097. You can read more on this from my colleagues Heather Stewart and Rowena Mason here: U2 has given \u20ac10m to support healthcare workers during the coronavirus outbreak in Ireland. The band\u2019s donation will be used to source and buy personal protective equipment (PPE) for frontline staff. RTE has reported the money is part of a scheme involving Irish aircraft leasing company Avolon, which is working with companies to raise funds to buy PPE from China. The first delivery arrived at Dublin airport earlier this week. The Irish government is already spending more than \u20ac200m securing additional equipment from the country, with Aer Lingus transporting the stock from Beijing to Dublin on dozens of flights. I\u2019m Amy Walker. You can get in touch with tips or follow me on Twitter (@amyrwalker). That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan, for now. Today\u2019s blog handover is dedicated to those among us who are living near active chainsaws, hammers, angle grinders and lawnmowers. How thrilling it will be to learn what all the commotion was about when we finally emerge from our homes. And with all that we have learned about our neighbours\u2019 tastes in music there will be no shortage of lively conversation. Over to you, Amy Walker. At least 88,538 people have now died worldwide, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. Around 1.5 million people have been infected, of whom 329,492 have recovered. China reported a slight increase in new coronavirus cases for the second straight day, as the number of infections involving incoming overseas travellers hit a two-week high. Boris Johnson\u2019s condition improved on Wednesday, with the UK prime minister now sitting up in bed and \u201cengaging positively\u201d with the clinical team, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said. Johnson remains in intensive care. German cases climb for third straight day. The number of confirmed coronavirus infections in Germany rose by 4,974 in the past 24 hours to 108,202 on Thursday, climbing for the third straight day after four previous days of drops. Japan confirms more than 500 cases on one day for the first time. Japan\u2019s health ministry said Thursday that the country had more than 500 new cases for the first time on Wednesday. The UK suffered its deadliest day since the outbreak began on Tuesday, as official figures showed 938 more people had died in hospitals, taking the overall total to 7,097. The true death toll is likely to be significantly higher. The US recorded its highest one-day death toll on Tuesday, with 1,858 people dying on Tuesday. New York City was still the worst-affected part of the country, recording 806 fatalities. The city has registered more than 4,500 deaths. There are more than 400,000 cases in the country. The US strategic national stockpile nearly out of personal protective equipment. America\u2019s Strategic National Stockpile is nearly out of the N95 respirators, surgical masks, face, shields, gowns and other medical supplies desperately needed to protect front-line medical workers treating coronavirus patients. But White House coronavirus task force officials say mitigation efforts are working, raising hopes of defying the worst case scenario projections. Bernie Sanders suspended his presidential campaign, making Joe Biden the presumptive Democratic nominee. Sanders pledged to continue working to ensure progressive proposals are included in the party\u2019s campaign platform. Donald Trump once again scapegoated the World Health Organization. The WHO\u2019s director-general earlier made a plea to avoid politicization as the world responds to crisis. Sub-Saharan Africa to fall into recession in 2020, says World Bank. The coronavirus outbreak is expected to push sub-Saharan Africa into recession in 2020 for the first time in 25 years, the World Bank said in a new forecast. Australia recorded its lowest number of new coronavirus cases in three weeks yesterday, with 96 new cases. This is the first time in three weeks the country has seen the number of new daily cases fall below 100. Oxfam warned coronavirus could push half a billion people into poverty. More than half a billion more people could be pushed into poverty unless urgent action is taken to bail out poor countries affected by the economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic, Oxfam has warned. Virus fears prompted a halt to Saudi military operations in Yemen. Concerns about a potential outbreak in Yemen, where no cases have been reported so far, are partly behind a decision to call a halt to the military action there that has left tens of thousands died and spread hunger and disease, a Saudi-led coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki has said. Japan\u2019s health ministry said Thursday that the country had more than 500 new cases for the first time on Wednesday, bringing the national total to 4,768 excluding hundreds from a cruise ship quarantined near Tokyo earlier this year. The continuous climb comes two days after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared a state of emergency in Tokyo and six other hard-hit prefectures, while asking people to reduce at least 70% of human interactions. But many people were seen commuting to their offices Thursday morning in downtown Tokyo, as many Japanese companies are slow to allow remote-working for their employees, raising doubts over how effective measures can be under the state-of-emergency measures. South Korea South Korea says it has reported 39 more cases of the coronavirus over the past 24 hours, in a continued slowdown of the virus outbreak in the Asian country, AP reports. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement Thursday the additional cases increased the country\u2019s total to 10,423. It says 6,973 of them have been recovered and released from quarantine. The centre says fatalities from the coronavirus rose by four to 204. But, the 39 new cases are the smallest daily jump since Feb. 20. South Korea recorded 47 and 53 new cases on Tuesday and Wednesday. There are still worries about a steady rise in infections linked to international arrivals, which has helped inflate the caseload in the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area. A total of 22 of the 39 new cases have been reported in Seoul and its surrounding Gyeonggi province. The number of confirmed coronavirus infections in Germany rose by 4,974 in the past 24 hours to 108,202 on Thursday, climbing for the third straight day after four previous days of drops, data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases showed. The reported death toll rose by 246 to 2,107. The rapidly-spreading coronavirus outbreak is expected to push sub-Saharan Africa into recession in 2020 for the first time in 25 years, the World Bank said in a new forecast on Thursday. The bank\u2019s Africa\u2019s Pulse report said the region\u2019s economy will contract 2.1% to 5.1% from growth of 2.4% last year, and that the coronavirus will cost sub-Saharan Africa $37 billion to $79 billion in output losses this year due to trade and value chain disruption, among other factors. Africa has more than 10,000 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, 562 deaths and 1,149 recoveries, according to a Reuters tally based on government statements and WHO data. \u201cThe Covid-19 pandemic is testing the limits of societies and economies across the world, and African countries are likely to be hit particularly hard,\u201d World Bank Vice President for Africa Hafez Ghanem said. The World Bank and International Monetary Fund are racing to provide emergency funds to African countries and others to combat the virus and mitigate the impact of sweeping shutdowns aiming at curbing its spread.

UK domestic abuse helplines report surge in calls during lockdown A helpline for perpetrators of domestic abuse who are seeking help to change their behaviour has received 25% more calls as the Covid-19 lockdown continues, fresh figures show. The Respect phone line, which provides confidential advice to perpetrators about violence and domestic abuse, had a 26.86% increase in calls in the week starting 30 March, compared with the week before. The Respect phone line website recorded an increase in hits of 125% in the same period. The figures come as Refuge, the UK\u2019s largest domestic abuse charity, reported a 120% increase in calls to its helpline, which provides advice and facilitates referrals to refuge accommodation, in 24 hours following a fresh round of publicity on Monday. George and Amal Clooney have donated more than one million dollars (\u00a3807,000) to the coronavirus relief effort, including money for the NHS, PA reports. The couple, who have a home in Berkshire, are understood to have donated money to six causes. That includes a total of $300,000 (\u00a3242,000) to the NHS, the relief effort in the Lombardy region of Italy and the Lebanese Food Bank. Amal, an internationally renowned human rights lawyer, was born in Lebanon. The couple also donated $250,000 dollars (\u00a3202,000) to both the Motion Picture and Television home, of which Hollywood star George is a board member, and to the US actors\u2019 union SAG-AFTRA Fund. The same sum went to the Los Angeles Mayor\u2019s Fund, which helps provide childcare for the city\u2019s emergency service and health care workers. Just a note that the Johns Hopkins University tracker, which is what the Guardian relies on for our infection, death and recovery figures, has changed the number of confirmed cases globally down from 1.5 million cases. This figure is likely to jump back up. At the moment it is showing 1,484,811 confirmed cases. We\u2019ll be keeping an eye on it in the meantime. At least 88,538 people have now died worldwide, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. Around 1.5 million people have been infected, of whom 329,492 have recovered. China reported a slight increase in new coronavirus cases for the second straight day, as the number of infections involving incoming overseas travellers hit a two-week high.

Italy recorded 542 new deaths, but the rate has slowed slightly. The number of infected people increased by 1,195, or 1.3%. There was also a record day-to-day increase \u2013 2,099 \u2013 in the number of people who have survived. The World Trade Organization forecast a fall in global trade of up to a third. The suffering caused by the pandemic will be compounded by \u201cunavoidable declines in trade and output\u201d, the WTO\u2019s director general said. Spanish sitcom tackles life in lockdown From Herculean efforts to keep children from interjecting in conference calls to fitness classes derailed by daytime drinking, a new sitcom in Spain \u2013 billed as the first of its kind on primetime TV \u2013 is set to tackle the quirks of life in lockdown. The show aims to offer a humorous take on the sweeping changes unleashed by the pandemic, said \u00c1lvaro Longoria, the creator and producer of Quarantine Diaries. \u201cWe are in no way trying to make fun of the people that are suffering. The focus is on those trying to make normal life out of an extraordinary situation.\u201d It is a delicate balance in Spain, where the virus has killed more than 14,500people and plunged its 47 million residents into one of the most restrictive lockdowns in Europe. For more than three weeks, social gatherings, leisurely walks and outdoor jogs have been banned in Spain, with residents ordered to remain in their homes except for essential trips. Vladimir Putin has taken a backseat in tackling Russia\u2019s coronavirus outbreak, working remotely from his residence in the Moscow suburbs and delegating powers that he has spent a generation mostly accumulating in the Kremlin. Strict quarantine measures and border closures have been imposed by trusted lieutenants including the Moscow mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, and the new prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, with officials leading parallel efforts to contain the virus and its economic fallout. Putin, meanwhile, has mainly focused on cushioning the financial blow to Russians during teleconferences or in televised speeches from an empty office, a difficult perch from which to appear to be managing a crisis that he has seemed keen to hand off. International health officials are warning that the Nicaraguan governments perplexing weeks-long refusal to take measures to control the spread of the new coronavirus is heightening the risk of an epidemic in Central America even as neighbouring countries take tough action. President Daniel Ortega\u2019s government urged Nicaraguans to party during Carnival celebrations, and it has said they should keep attending sports events and cultural festivals, and pack the countrys beaches during Holy Week vacations this week. Doctors have been told not to alarm patients by wearing masks or using sanitizing gel. Before schools closed for an extended vacation Friday, principals had threatened to expel students who missed class, and last month a third baseman was banned from professional baseball for three years after he asked to stop playing over virus fears. Ortega\u2019s administration has offered no detailed explanation for its refusal to take widely accepted measures. But the health minister has spoken of the need to support the economy, badly damaged by two years of anti-government protests and harsh crackdowns on dissent. Some analysts say Ortega and his circle may fear that anti-virus measures would weaken their hold on power. Mexican authorities said on Wednesday that about 60 personnel across two more hospitals have tested positive for the coronavirus, adding to a wave of infections among medical workers, according to local authorities and media reports. The two outbreaks struck a hospital outside Mexico City and one in the western state of Baja California Sur. The coronavirus was first detected at the hospital in Tlanepantla de Baz, in Mexico state just outside the capital, on March 10, the head of Mexico\u2019s social security institute, Zoe Robledo, said at the president\u2019s regular news conference on Wednesday. At least 20 doctors tested positive there. He said the transmission did not originate inside the facility and had been tracked to three separate cases - one patient and two doctors who did not have contact with each other. He said the cluster was not similar to an outbreak in the city of Monclova in the northern border state of Coahuila, where 45 health workers have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to the state\u2019s health ministry. New Zealand will begin moving citizens to compulsory quarantine from Friday as they return from overseas, stepping up its efforts to slow the spread of the coronavirus halfway through a four-week nationwide lockdown. \u201cNo one goes home, everyone goes into a managed facility,\u201d Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said, adding that 14 days spent in a government-approved facility would be a prerequisite for all foreign travellers. \u201cEven one person slipping through the cracks and bringing the virus in can see an explosion in cases, as we have observed with some of our bigger clusters,\u201d she told a media briefing in Wellington on Thursday. Ardern added that her cabinet would decide whether to extend the nationwide curbs on April 20, two days before the lockdown is set to end. Australian police said on Thursday they have taken the \u201cblack box\u201d of a cruise ship which disembarked hundreds of passengers infected with the coronavirus in Sydney, as part of a homicide investigation into the country\u2019s deadliest infection source. The investigation got underway as the Australian authorities said the rate of new coronavirus infections hit its lowest number in three weeks and began arranging more flights to bring home citizens stranded abroad. The Ruby Princess cruise ship, owned by Carnival Corp , has become a flashpoint of public anger in Australia after authorities granted the ship permission to disembark its passengers last month without health checks. Hundreds of the passengers later tested positive for the coronavirus and 15 have died, out of Australia\u2019s roughly 6,000 confirmed cases and 51 deaths. The governor of central Japan\u2019s Aichi, which includes the city of Nagoya and also hosts Toyota Motor Corp, on Thursday said he would declare a state of emergency for his prefecture the following day. Hideaki Omura made the announcement two days after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe formally imposed a state of emergency on Tokyo and six other parts of the country. Aichi was not included in the emergency despite having the fifth-highest number of infections among Japan\u2019s prefectures, data from public broadcaster NHK shows. Omura told a news conference that his prefecture had been in talks with the central government and was making preparations towards being included. The central government will respond \u201cswiftly,\u201d he said. Honduras will extend its national curfew to 19 April as the country ramps up efforts to contain the coronavirus, the security ministry said on Wednesday. The Central American country registered 31 new cases of the virus, bringing its total to 343 cases and 23 deaths, the system for risk prevention said. China released new measures on Wednesday to try and prevent asymptomatic \u201csilent carriers\u201d of coronavirus from causing a second wave of infections, as the country reported another modest rise in new confirmed cases, Reuters reports. Mainland China reported 63 new confirmed cases on Wednesday, up from 62 a day earlier, the National Health Commission said. Of those, 61 were travellers arriving from overseas, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in China to 81,865. China also reported 56 new asymptomatic cases on Wednesday, bringing the total number of such cases to 657 since data for such infections were published daily from 1 April. The State Council, or Cabinet, on Wednesday published new rules to manage asymptomatic coronavirus carriers, or what some state media described as \u201csilent carriers\u201d of the virus. Under the regulations, medical institutions must report detection of asymptomatic cases within two hours of their discovery. Local governments must then identify all known close contacts of the case within 24 hours. Asymptomatic patients will be quarantined collectively for 14 days, and will be counted as confirmed cases if they start to show symptoms. People who have had close contact with them must also be quarantined for two weeks. Now, a song using Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s comments earlier this week regarding masks and \u201cspeaking moistly\u201d: Podcast: 100 days that changed the world, Part 1 What began as a mystery virus at a Chinese market in December swiftly became a global crisis. The Guardian\u2019s Michael Safi and Patrick Wintour recount the first 100 days as coronavirus took hold, upending the lives of billions of citizens. Easter lockdowns around the world Measures ranging from the draconian to the quixotic \u2013 a French mayor has banned sitting on benches \u2013 represent a collective warning to citizens who may be tempted to take a break from the restraint of recent weeks. The goal is to keep people at home, but diverging approaches on whether to allow Easter egg hunts, barbecues, watersports and other activities underline the unprecedented dilemmas facing authorities. In Australia, police will use cameras and number-plate recognition technology to monitor traffic and patrol caravan parks and other holiday spots. Beach towns along Brazil\u2019s south-eastern coast are sealing themselves off to prevent an influx of tourists. In France about 160,000 police and gendarmes have been deployed across the country to make sure people stay home during what is normally the weekend of the Tour de France\u2019s Grand D\u00e9part. The government imposed a full curfew on Wednesday afternoon lasting until Thursday morning to cover the Jewish Passover holiday, traditionally a gathering of friends and family to eat, drink and commemorate the Israelites\u2019 flight from Egyptian slavery. Australia recorded its lowest number of new coronavirus cases in three weeks yesterday, with 96 new cases. This is the first time in three weeks the country has seen the number of new daily cases fall below 100. Australia\u2019s health minister Greg Hunt says 6,068 Australians have been diagnosed with Covid-19. Of those, 82 are in intensive care and 35 are on ventilators. 51 people have died. Hunt says while the early signs that Australia is successfully flattening the curve are encouraging, there is still \u201ca long way to go\u201d and he urges people to stay at home, particularly over the break: As we go into Easter with welcome news for Australia, the virus does not take a holiday - therefore none of us can relax and what we do. This in many ways is the most important weekend we may face in the whole course of the virus. If we can lock in the gains that we\u2019ve made as a nation through the courage and sacrifice of those on the health, medical and policing frontlines, but also through the immense goodwill and discipline of Australians, then we can help really protect Australian lives going forward and give ourselves the pathway through.

There has been a huge amount of praise today for Emily Maitlis\u2019 cold open on the BBC\u2019s flagship current affairs programme Newsnight last night. Maitlis responded to the language that has been used by many of Boris Johnson\u2019s colleagues, who have said the prime minister will recover from Covid-19 because of his \u201cfortitude\u201d and \u201cstrength of character\u201d. She also responded to the claim that the prime minister\u2019s infection reveals the coronavirus is \u201cthe great leveller\u201d when it is clear that lower-paid members of society like nurses, shelf-stackers, bus drivers and care home-workers are far more exposed to the virus and likely to die from it and that the experience of lockdown is very different depending on people\u2019s wealth. It\u2019s worth a watch. Over to New Zealand now, where the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern ,has refused to postpone the country\u2019s September elections over the coronavirus pandemic, despite calls for a delay from her deputy and the deputy opposition leader. On Thursday New Zealand recorded a significant drop in corona cases for the fourth day in a row, with just 29 new infections, 11 fewer than the previous day. Full story below: You can get in touch with me at any time with questions, comments, jokes or tips on Twitter @helenrsullivan. America\u2019s Strategic National Stockpile is nearly out of the N95 respirators, surgical masks, face, shields, gowns and other medical supplies desperately needed to protect front-line medical workers treating coronavirus patients. The Department of Health and Human Services told the Associated Press Wednesday that the federal stockpile was in the process of deploying all remaining personal protective equipment in its inventory. The HHS statement confirms federal documents released Wednesday by the House Oversight and Reform Committee showing that about 90% of the personal protective equipment in the stockpile has been distributed to state and local governments. HHS spokeswoman Katie McKeogh said the remaining 10% will be kept in reserve to support federal response efforts. For the last month, health care workers across the nation have taken to social media to illustrate the shortages by taking selfies wearing home-sewn masks on their faces and trash bags over their scrubs. ProPublica is reporting that a Dutch company, Royal Philips NV, which was meant to sell 10,000 ventilators to the US but did not deliver has now entered a new deal with the government \u2013 charging four times as much per machine: The Dutch company that received millions of taxpayer dollars to develop an affordable ventilator for pandemics, but never delivered them, has struck a much more lucrative deal with the federal government to make 43,000 ventilators at four times the price. The US Department of Health and Human Services announced Wednesday that it plans to pay Royal Philips N.V. $646.7 million for the new ventilators \u2014 paying more than $15,000 each. The first 2,500 units are to arrive before the end of May, HHS said, and the rest by the end of December. Philips refused to say which model of ventilator the government was buying. But in response to questions from ProPublica, HHS officials said the government is purchasing the Trilogy EV300, the more expensive version of the ventilator that was developed with federal funds. \u2018In a war, we draw\u2019: Vietnam\u2019s artists join fight against Covid-19 Chris Humphrey reports from Hanoi. A masked healthcare worker stands valiant as a soldier, flanked by a bold slogan proclaiming that \u201cto stay at home is to love your country\u201d. Beneath, fine print implores residents to declare symptoms or report anyone escaping quarantine. The poster, by artist Le Duc Hiep\u2019s, is just one of numerous art forms to emerge from Vietnam \u2013 from viral hand washing songs to state stamps \u2013 that reflect the war-time spirit many in the country are invoking as they try to contain the virus. With its archetypal propaganda aesthetic, nationalistic tone and heroic figures, one might assume Hiep\u2019s poster was created by a communist state\u2019s information ministry. In reality, he chose a design he felt would resonate with people to create a retrofitted PSA for those not following the rules. At least 88,444 people have now died worldwide, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. They say more than 1.5 million people have been infected, of whom 329,492 have recovered. China reported a slight increase in new coronavirus cases for the second straight day, as the number of infections involving incoming overseas travellers hit a two-week high. Boris Johnson\u2019s condition improved, with the UK prime minister now sitting up in bed and \u201cengaging positively\u201d with the clinical team, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said. Johnson remains in intensive care. The UK suffered its deadliest day since the outbreak began as official figures showed 938 more people had died in hospitals, taking the overall total to 7,097. The true death toll is likely to be significantly higher. The US recorded its highest one-day death toll, with 1,858 people dying on Tuesday. New York City was still the worst-affected part of the country, recording 806 fatalities. The city has registered more than 4,500 deaths. There are more than 400,000 cases in the country. Bernie Sanders suspended his presidential campaign, making Joe Biden the presumptive Democratic nominee. Sanders pledged to continue working to ensure progressive proposals are included in the party\u2019s campaign platform. Linda Tripp, who made the tapes of Monica Lewinsky discussing her relationship with Bill Clinton, has died. Tripp\u2019s recordings of Lewinsky decribing the extramarital affair ultimately led to Clinton\u2019s impeachment. The former Pentagon civil servant had reportedly been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer recently. Donald Trump once again scapegoated the World Health Organization. The WHO\u2019s director-general earlier made a plea to avoid politicization as the world responds to crisis. Oxfam warned coronavirus could push half a billion people into poverty. More than half a billion more people could be pushed into poverty unless urgent action is taken to bail out poor countries affected by the economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic, Oxfam has warned. Virus fears prompted a halt to Saudi military operations in Yemen. Concerns about a potential outbreak in Yemen, where no cases have been reported so far, are partly behind a decision to call a halt to the military action there that has left tens of thousands died and spread hunger and disease, a Saudi-led coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki has said. Italy recorded 542 new deaths, but the rate has slowed slightly. The number of infected people increased by 1,195, or 1.3%. There was also a record day-to-day increase \u2013 2,099 \u2013 in the number of people who have survived. The World Trade Organization forecast a fall in global trade of up to a third. The suffering caused by the pandemic will be compounded by \u201cunavoidable declines in trade and output\u201d, the WTO\u2019s director general said. US says mitigation efforts are working, raising hopes of defying worst case scenario Social distancing and other mitigation efforts by the American people are working, raising hopes that the US can defy projected death tolls, the White House coronavirus task force said on Wednesday. The task force projected on 31 March that the pandemic could claim between 100,000 and 240,000 American lives, even if the federal guidelines were maintained, based in part on evidence from Europe. There is now cautious optimism that the final total, while still monumental, will be lower. Dr Deborah Birx, the response coordinator, told reporters: \u201cWe carefully looked at Italy and Spain and we are doing much better in many cases than several other countries and we\u2019re trying to understand that. We believe that our healthcare delivery system in the United States is quite extraordinary.\u201d Former acting U.S. Navy Secretary Thomas Modly\u2019s controversial trip to Guam over the weekend where he ridiculed the commander of a coronavirus-stricken U.S. aircraft carrier cost taxpayers at least US$243,000, officials said on Wednesday. Modly resigned on Tuesday after mounting criticism for firing and ridiculing Captain Brett Crozier of the Theodore Roosevelt who pleaded for help to contain a coronavirus outbreak onboard. Modly quit only after mounting pressure from Congress and a backlash from the crew, and followed U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s own suggestion on Monday that he might get involved in the matter. Two U.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Modly flew for about 35 hours on a C-37B, the military version of a Gulfstream jet. The officials said that based on the flying time, the cost was $243,151.65, Reuters reports. So far, 286 personnel onboard the carrier have tested positive for the coronavirus. China reported a slight increase in new coronavirus cases for the second straight day, as the number of infections involving incoming overseas travellers hit a two-week high. China reported 63 new cases on Wednesday, up from 62 a day earlier, the National Health Commission said. Of those, 61 involved travellers arriving from overseas, the health authority said on Thursday, the most since March 25. That brings the total number of confirmed cases in mainland China to 81,865. While infections have fallen from their peak in February after China locked down several cities and imposed strict travel restrictions, authorities have called for continued vigilance amid fears of a second wave of infections. Falkland islands authorities announced the cancelation of visitor permits Wednesday, closing the British overseas territory in the South Atlantic to most arrivals, after five cases of coronavirus were reported among military personnel on the islands. Only returning residents, individual holding Falkland status, military personnel and other essential individuals will be allowed entry, with exceptions to be determined \u201con a case by case basis,\u201d Falkland authorities said in statement. A two-week quarantine is already in place for arrivals. With the suspension of most flights in South America, the commercial LATAM air service that connected the islands to Brazil and Chile has ceased being operational, meaning the islands\u2019 only air connection is now through their twice-weekly Airbridge with the UK. All five cases are individuals stationed at the Mount Pleasent Complex, where between one and two thousand British military personnel are stationed. None of the around 3,400 civilian population have been reported as coronavirus positive. \u2018Please don\u2019t politicise this virus,\u2019 urged World Health Organisation (WHO) director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus a day after US president Donald Trump tried to pin blame on the WHO for thousands of American deaths from the coronavirus. Trump accused the WHO of having \u2018called it wrong\u2019 and threatened to pull funding. Ghebreyesus gave a stern warning to those seeking to score political points amid the pandemic: \u2018If you want to have many more body bags, then you do it. You have many other ways to prove yourselves,\u2019 he said. \u2018This is not the one to use for politics, it\u2019s like playing with fire\u2019 Sex toy sales triple during New Zealand\u2019s coronavirus lockdown They were warned by the officials against stockpiling toilet paper or flour. But that\u2019s not all New Zealanders have been hoarding, according to the nation\u2019s largest retailer of sex toys, which said sales of its products tripled after Jacinda Ardern announced a month-long lockdown of the country. The restrictions also prompted a tripling of sex toy sales in the 48 hours before the lockdown was imposed on 25 March, and the prospect of a boring month indoors seemed to have prompted New Zealanders to stash adult products that they might not have tried before, said Adult Toy Megastore, a New Zealand-based company. \u201cWe\u2019re selling a lot of beginner toys ... all our beginner ranges are very popular,\u201d said Emily Writes, a spokesperson for the business. \u201cIt definitely looks like people are saying: \u2018I\u2019ve got time, I might try something new.\u2019\u201d Cats can become infected with the new coronavirus but dogs appear not to be vulnerable, according to a study published on Wednesday, prompting the WHO to say it will take a closer look at transmission of the virus between humans and pets, Reuters reports. The study, published on the website of the journal Science, found that ferrets can also become infected with SARS-CoV-2, the scientific term for the virus that causes the Covid-19 disease. Dogs, chickens, pigs and ducks are not likely to catch the virus, however, the researchers found. The study was aimed at identifying which animals are vulnerable to the virus so they can be used to test experimental vaccines to fight the pandemic. The study, based on research conducted in China in January and February, found cats and ferrets highly susceptible to the virus when researchers attempted to infect the animals by introducing viral particles via the nose. They also found cats can infect each other via respiratory droplets. Infected cats had virus in the mouth, nose and small intestine. Kittens exposed to the virus had massive lesions in their lungs, nose and throat. Here are the two main developments from the White House\u2019s daily press briefing on Wednesday evening: Donald Trump once again scapegoated the World Health Organization. The WHO\u2019s director-general earlier made a plea to avoid politicization as the world responds to crisis. Trump also tore down the idea of voting by mail, alleging widespread fraud \u2014 without any evidence to back his claims.Last week, he said if Democrats succeed in their efforts to make it easier to vote by mail during the coronavirus pandemic, \u201cyou\u2019d never have a Republican elected in this country again\u201d. Rock band U2 has donated \u20ac10 million to support health care workers battling coronavirus in Ireland. The money will be used to source and buy personal protective equipment (PPE) for frontline staff. A spokeswoman for the band confirmed the move to the PA news agency. RTE has reported the donation is part of an initiative involving Irish aircraft leasing company Avolon, which is working with public and private companies to raise funds to buy tonnes of PPE equipment from China. Bernie Sanders, who has dropped out of the presidential race today, wrote an op-ed about the US coronavirus response for The Guardian. In this unprecedented moment in American history, we need an unprecedented legislative response. President Trump is incapable of providing leadership, and instead continues to mislead the public and act out of political self-interest. So it is Congress that must lead, and it must do so now. With anxiety growing, everyone in our country needs to know that, in the midst of this horrific pandemic and economic meltdown, their government is doing everything possible to keep them healthy and financially secure. In other words, we need to build upon and expand the recent stimulus package with new and bolder emergency legislation which must be passed as soon as possible. Here is Sanders\u2019 announcement earlier: Read the full piece for the Guardian at the link below: Ecuadorean President Lenin Moreno on Wednesday called for an investigation into how local authorities handled the bodies of coronavirus victims in Guayaquil, the epicenter of the country\u2019s outbreak that has overwhelmed health and sanitary authorities, Reuters reports. Family members have complained via social media that public hospitals have failed to quickly locate the bodies of their loved ones and in some cases misidentified the remains. \u201cWe will not allow anyone to be buried without being identified. They deserve a goodbye with dignity!\u201d Moreno wrote via Twitter. The tweet included a copy of a formal complaint over alleged irregularities filed by Jorge Wated, the state official tasked with handling corpses during the crisis. As of Wednesday Ecuador had about 4,450 cases of the disease, with 242 confirmed deaths and another 240 who are suspected to have died from the virus. Of those, 3,047 cases and 144 deaths were in the province of Guayas, where Guayaquil is located. Health Minister Juan Carlos Zevallos said on Tuesday he had sacked an official who requested money in exchange for handing over the remains of a victim in a Guayaquil public hospital. In Mexico, a government body called Wednesday for authorities to investigate nightclubs that are advertising home delivery of table dances and other services amid the crackdown on large public gatherings and nonessential services during the coronavirus pandemic, AP reports. The National Human Rights Commission said the offerings violate both the health campaign and womens rights. The National Citizens Observatory of Feminicide said Tuesday that table dance take-out services are being offered by mens clubs that have been linked to allegations of sexual trafficking of women. It said some of the clubs that were ordered closed 26 March to stem the spread of the coronavirus have taken to offering home delivery. Women involved in such activities \u201care being exposed not just to being infected with Covid-19, but also to different forms of violence,\u201d the group said in a statement. Donald Trump has blamed the World Health Organization for failures in the initial response to the coronavirus pandemic, even threatening to cut its funding, but most health experts say it has performed well with limited resources. Accusing the WHO of giving bad advice, being \u201cChina-centric\u201d and even withholding information, Trump claimed to have stopped US funding in a press briefing on Tuesday, only to claim a few minutes later that he was just considering it, pending a review of its performance. In fact, the US is already about $200m in arrears in assessed contributions (national membership fees). It has given more in donations, and was the biggest single donor in 2019 \u2013 certainly far more than China, which gives a paltry amount given the size of its economy. But the US is far from providing the majority of the WHO\u2019s funds, as Trump claimed, and its voluntary contributions have largely been tied to specific projects. WHO\u2019s total annual budget is about $2.5bn, and contributions from member states have not significantly increased over three decades. More than half a billion more people could be pushed into poverty unless urgent action is taken to bail out poor countries affected by the economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic, Oxfam has warned. Ahead of three key international meetings next week, the charity said the impact of shutting down economies to prevent the virus spreading risked setting back the fight against poverty by a decade globally \u2013 and by 30 years in the hardest-pressed countries of sub-Saharan Africa, north Africa and the Middle East. Pakistan doctors beaten by police as they despair of \u2018untreatable\u2019 pandemic My colleagues Hannah Ellis-Petersen and Shah Meer Baloch report: Doctors in Pakistan have warned of \u201cdeplorable\u201d conditions on the frontlines of the country\u2019s coronavirus outbreak, describing the pandemic as untreatable in one region and accusing police of brutally suppressing protests over working conditions. One doctor who took part in a sit-in on Monday to protest against a lack of personal protective equipment said he had been \u201cbeaten and humiliated\u201d by police. \u201cIn the beginning, I thought, \u2018How could police use violence against the frontline fighters of Covid-19 when some days ago the same officers had saluted us for leading during the pandemic?\u2019\u201d said Amanullah, speaking from the police station where he was being held in Quetta, in the Balochistan region. \u201cBut we were wrong. Sticks and butts of AK-47 rifles rained down on us. We were dragged through the street and thrown into trucks.\u201d He and about 60 other doctors were held in police detention overnight and only released at midnight on Tuesday. New York City\u2019s death toll from the coronavirus has been disproportionately high in black and Hispanic communities, and the city is starting an outreach campaign for those residents, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing folks who have struggled before really being hit particularly hard,\u201d de Blasio said at a City Hall briefing. Preliminary data indicates that black people account for 28% of the city\u2019s COVID-19 death toll, even though they are just 22% of the city\u2019s population. Hispanic people account for 34% of the city\u2019s virus death toll and 29% of its population, AP reports. State health officials reported Wednesday that nearly 4,600 people have been killed by the virus in New York City. The city\u2019s new round of data is based on a smaller number of cases, about 1,600, where the race and ethnicity of the victim is known. De Blasio said the city would embark on a multimillion-dollar public service campaign to reach non-English speaking communities with information about the virus. When the city fatality figures are adjusted to reflect the age makeup of ethnic groups within the city\u2019s population, the disparities are more stark. The age-adjusted death rate for both blacks and Hispanics was more than double the rate for non-Hispanic whites. Asians, meanwhile, experienced a much lower rate of fatalities: 8.4 per 100,000 residents, compared with 10.2 for non-Hispanic whites, 19.8 for non-Hispanic blacks and 22.8 for Hispanics. Although the figures released Wednesday show racial disparities in who has died of the virus, the disparities are not as great as those that have been reported elsewhere in the country. Veep and Seinfeld star Julia Louis-Dreyfus has released a statement, too: UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has released a statement as Donald Trump continues to criticise the World Health Organization\u2019s response to the coronavirus crisis. Trump also called the WHO \u201cChina-centric\u201d: Statement by the Secretary-General - on COVID-19 The Covid-19 pandemic is one of the most dangerous challenges this world has faced in our lifetime. It is above all a human crisis with severe health and socio-economic consequences. The World Health Organization, with thousands of its staff, is on the front lines, supporting Member States and their societies, especially the most vulnerable among them, with guidance, training, equipment and concrete life-saving services as they fight the virus. ... It is my belief that the World Health Organization must be supported, as it is absolutely critical to the world\u2019s efforts to win the war against Covid-19. This virus is unprecedented in our lifetime and requires an unprecedented response. Obviously, in such conditions, it is possible that the same facts have had different readings by different entities. Once we have finally turned the page on this epidemic, there must be a time to look back fully to understand how such a disease emerged and spread its devastation so quickly across the globe, and how all those involved reacted to the crisis. The lessons learned will be essential to effectively address similar challenges, as they may arise in the future. But now is not that time. Now is the time for unity, for the international community to work together in solidarity to stop this virus and its shattering consequences. The White House daily press briefing has just ended and we\u2019ll have a summary of what happened there for you shortly. In the meantime here are other major developments from the US today: Bernie Sanders suspended his presidential campaign, making Joe Biden the presumptive Democratic nominee. Sanders pledged to continue working to ensure progressive proposals are included in the party\u2019s campaign platform. More than 400,000 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the US. The national death toll has surpassed 14,000 and at least 1,939 people died of the virus yesterday, marking the deadliest day in the US since the crisis started. New York is starting to flatten its curve of coronavirus cases even as the state death toll continues to climb. New York\u2019s \u201cstay at home\u201d order is having an impact on the number of coronavirus cases, governor Andrew Cuomo said, but yesterday\u2019s death toll of 779 was the state\u2019s worst single-day figure yet. Linda Tripp, who made the tapes of Monica Lewinsky discussing her relationship with Bill Clinton, has reportedly died. Tripp\u2019s recordings of Lewinsky decribing the extramarital affair ultimately led to Clinton\u2019s impeachment. The former Pentagon civil servant had reportedly been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer recently. Hello and welcome today\u2019s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic with me, Helen Sullivan. As the world confirms more than 1.5 million cases of coronavirus, both the US and the UK have experienced their worst daily number of deaths. There are also major political developments in both countries, with US Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders dropping out of the race and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson still in intensive care. I\u2019ll be with you for the next few hours. You can get in touch with me at any time with questions, comments, jokes or tips on Twitter @helenrsullivan. At least 87,706 people have now died worldwide, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. They say more than 1.5 million people have been infected, more than 315,000 of whom have recovered. Boris Johnson\u2019s condition improved, with the UK prime minister now sitting up in bed and \u201cengaging positively\u201d with the clinical team, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said. Johnson remains in intensive care. The UK suffered its deadliest day since the outbreak began as official figures showed 938 more people had died in hospitals, taking the overall total to 7,097. The true death toll is likely to be significantly higher. The US recorded its highest one-day death toll, with 1,858 people dying on Tuesday. New York City was still the worst-affected part of the country, recording 806 fatalities. The city has registered more than 4,000 deaths. There are more than 400,000 cases in the country. Virus fears prompted a halt to Saudi military operations in Yemen. Concerns about a potential outbreak in Yemen, where no cases have been reported so far, are partly behind a decision to call a halt to the military action there that has left tens of thousands died and spread hunger and disease, a Saudi-led coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki has said. Italy recorded 542 new deaths, but the rate has slowed slightly. The number of infected people increased by 1,195, or 1.3%. There was also a record day-to-day increase \u2013 2,099 \u2013 in the number of people who have survived. It emerged that the European commission is preparing a \u201croadmap\u201d to a coordinated lifting of lockdowns. However, EU member states were advised to extend their restrictions until 15 May. The World Trade Organization forecast a fall in global trade of up to a third. The suffering caused by the pandemic will be compounded by \u201cunavoidable declines in trade and output\u201d, the WTO\u2019s director general said. The European Union reshuffled its aid budget, promising \u20ac20bn to Africa, Asia, the Pacific, and eastern Europe. The bloc\u2019s chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, said: \u201cUnless the virus is defeated everywhere, it will not be defeated anywhere.\u201d Work is due to restart at some of the German car factories owned by Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler in less than a fortnight. It said its German staff would work shorter hours until 30 April. Italy declared its ports \u201cunsafe\u201d in a move that appeared designed to block rescue efforts for people struggling to cross the Mediterranean. The measure came as departures from Libya increased with the arrival of good weather."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
