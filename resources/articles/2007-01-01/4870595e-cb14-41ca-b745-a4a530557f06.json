That's me - as a chef, I'm a meat-roaster rather than a cake-baker. Of course, I'll happily knock out cakes and pastries for guests at River Cottage HQ, but for some reason I can never quite make the perfect Victoria sponge. My shortcomings are never more apparent than at the local WI market. To be honest, it makes me nauseous to see all those tables groaning with so many examples of baking excellence - and those apparently sweet old ladies would sooner beat you and bake you than divulge their secrets. My response is to try to educate myself, buying up cakes by the score - coffee and walnut, lemon drizzle, double chocolate - in the hope of discovering what I'm doing right and what I'm not. This WI panic-buying means there's usually some lovely cake in a tin at home, and we occasionally sit down to afternoon tea, a proper one - a \"high tea\", as it used to be called. Sometimes my girls will make a tray of biscuits to augment whatever's in the cake tin, and it's also an opportunity for me to get a handle on my sponge complex. Happily, my arduous research has paid off and I've developed some lovely, simple recipes on which I've come to rely when something sweet is called for. Quick rich chocolate cake One of those very rich, very wicked chocolate creations that is almost more pudding than cake. Made with lashings of chocolate and butter, and only just enough flour to hold it together, it should still wobble slightly in the centre when you take it from the oven. This means it will have a divine, sticky, fudgy centre once it's cooled down. Serves 10. 250g dark chocolate (around 70% cocoa solids), broken into chunks 250g unsalted butter, cut into cubes 4 medium eggs, separated 200g unrefined caster sugar (or 100g caster mixed with 100g light muscovado sugar) 50g plain flour 50g ground almonds Preheat the oven to 170C/325F/gas mark 3 and line a 23cm springform cake tin with baking parchment. Put the chocolate and butter in a bowl and melt over a pan of just simmering water. Meanwhile, whisk the egg yolks with the sugar until well combined. (If you use the caster and muscovado mix, the cake will have a lovely hint of caramel flavour.) Stir the melted chocolate and butter into the egg and sugar mixture. Combine the flour and almonds, then stir in, too. Whisk the egg whites until they hold firm peaks. Stir a spoonful of egg white into the chocolate mixture to loosen it, then fold in the rest with a large metal spoon, keeping in as much air as possible. Pour into the tin and bake for 30 minutes, or until only just set in the centre. Serve warm or cold. Customised cookies This lovely recipe allows you to create your own bespoke bickies. Just add to the basic dough 100g of whatever you fancy. Chopped almonds mixed with dried cranberries is one favourite combination; hazelnuts, dark chocolate chunks and orange zest is another. Makes 12 large cookies. 125g unsalted butter 100g unrefined granulated sugar 75g light muscovado sugar 1 egg 2 tsp vanilla extract 150g plain flour \u00bd tsp baking powder A pinch of salt 100g extras - chunks of chocolate, chunks of nut, chopped dried fruit (apricots, cranberries, sultanas), crystallised ginger, spices, lemon or orange zest, pinenuts... Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5 and line two baking sheets with baking parchment. Melt the butter in a small saucepan. Put the two sugars into a bowl, pour on the butter and beat. Break in the egg and add the vanilla. Beat to combine, sift in the flour, baking powder and salt, then stir in your chosen extras. Dot heaped dessertspoonfuls of the mixture over the baking sheets, leaving plenty of space in between - the cookies really spread out. Bake for eight to 10 minutes, until just turning golden brown. Leave on the baking sheets to harden for a couple of minutes, then carefully lift up the baking parchment and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Pear and almond tart This looks beautiful if you fan the pear slices out over the frangipane filling. Serves six to eight. For the rough-puff pastry 125g cold unsalted butter, cut into small cubes 250g plain flour Pinch of salt A pinch of ground cinnamon (optional) 2-3 tbsp iced water For the frangipane 75g unsalted butter, softened 75g unrefined caster sugar 2 medium eggs, beaten 20g plain flour 75g ground almonds A dash of vanilla extract For the topping 4 pears, peeled, quartered, cored and cut into 4-5mm slices 2 tsp demerara sugar Toss the butter into the flour with the salt and cinnamon until coated, then add the iced water and bring the dough together with your hands. Add a little more water if necessary, but no more than you need to get a medium-firm dough that is not too sticky, with large pieces of the fat still intact in it. On a well-floured surface, shape the dough by hand into a fat rectangle and roll it out with a well-floured rolling pin. Roll away from you in one direction only to keep the rectangular shape as much as you can. When the dough is 2cm thick, fold the far third towards you and the near third back over that, so you have a rectangle a third of the size and three times as thick. Give the pastry a quarter turn to the right and roll out again, away from you, into another long rectangle. Repeat, folding and turning, at least four times. You will need to keep dusting with flour. Should the dough become sticky, chill for an hour or so, dust with more flour and resume rolling. When finished, chill for at least an hour before using. Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6 and butter a baking tray. For the frangipane, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, then beat in the eggs, flour, almonds and vanilla. Roll the pastry out in a rough circle about 4mm thick (no thinner). Use a plate to mark a 25cm-diameter disc and cut it out. Place on the greased baking tray and, with the tip of a knife, score a line 2cm inside the border of the pastry disc, as if you were making a giant vol-au-vent. Spread on the frangipane, going up to but not beyond the score mark. Arrange the sliced pears on top and sprinkle with the sugar. Bake for 12 minutes, then lower the heat to 180C/350F/gas mark 4 and cook for another 20-30 minutes. The tart should be a light golden-brown, with puffed, crisp pastry. Serve warm or cold, with cream or custard, or unadorned. \u00b7 Gill Meller is head chef at River Cottage.
