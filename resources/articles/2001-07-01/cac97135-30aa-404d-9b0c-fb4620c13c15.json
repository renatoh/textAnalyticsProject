Among 34 FTSE-100 Index members not in the new FTSE4Good UK 50 are Tesco, Royal Bank of Scotland and Marconi. The Footsie has developed the ethical index so investors can track companies that practice corporate social responsibility. To merit inclusion, companies must fulfil three criteria - work towards environmental stability, develop a positive relationship with stockholders and uphold and support universal human rights. The top five comapnies of the UK index, ranked by market capitalisation, are BP, GlaxoSmithKline, Vodafone, HSBC and pharmaceuticals company AstraZeneca. There are 283 companies in the UK index altogether and other big names include LloydsTSB, Abbey National, Barclays, BT and Unilever. There are six new FTSE4Good indices altogether both in the UK, Europe and the US and all the indices will go live on July 31. The new FTSE4Good indices will exclude firms involved in activities such as making weapons or manufacturing cigarettes. To tie in with the launch of the indices, Close Fund Management is launching the FTSE4Good UK Fund, the first fund to track the new UK ethical index. Mark Makepeace, FTSE's chief executive said: \"FTSE aims to set an achievable framework for corporate social responsibility to which all companies should aspire. I believe FTSE4Good will increase the levels of socially responsible investment and provide a platform for further debate and change.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
