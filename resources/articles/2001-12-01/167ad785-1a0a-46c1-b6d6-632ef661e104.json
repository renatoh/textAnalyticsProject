More than 118,000 noise-related complaints are received by councils in England and Wales each year, but only 14 councils have signed up to tackle the problem under the 1996 Night Noise Act. Councils have been put off from taking action because they had to sign up to the act in its entirety, which meant they had to provide a 24-hour manned noise service. Environment minister Michael Meacher today announced the act will be amended to allow local authorities power to adopt certain aspects of the act, without signing up to the complete package. The amended proposal will mean authorities can employ noise officers at weekends and during the Christmas period. Announcing the measures Mr Meacher said: \"Neighbour noise is a serious trouble to some people and causes a lot of aggravation. \"I want to ensure that local authorities have all the necessary powers to deal with people who make life so unbearable for their neighbours through unacceptably noisy activities at any time of day. \"The problem at present is that to use the powers of the 1996 act councils have to first adopt it and then provide round-the-clock noise patrols which are very expensive.\" The minister dismissed suggestions that the government wanted to stop people from enjoying themselves in their own homes. He said: \"This is not a killjoy provision. It is just saying be considerate and when it is 2am or 3am, turn the noise down. As well as amending the legislation, the government is embarking on a publicity campaign by issuing 100,000 leaflets that will inform people of their rights under the law. At present persistent noise offenders can have their music equipment seized and noise abatement notices issued, but very few end up in court. As well as announcing the change in the law, the minister also launched a three-month consultation exercise to tackle ambient noise - noise that disturbs people living near airports, railways, major roads and factories."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
