Just as Karl Rove once predicted a permanent Republican majority, some Democrats are now openly discussing the possibility that Barack Obama will usher in a new permanent progressive majority. Democrats have good reason to be optimistic. The demographics Obama scored so well on are widely perceived to be the future of the American electorate: minorities, young people (particularly professionals) and women. While all votes are equal, John McCain's strength appeared to be among the older generation of voters who are not the future of a political party. Additionally, to the extent that Obama suffered resistance from voters in Appalachia and other areas on racial reasons, it may be safe to assume that over time these attitudes will soften as people become more comfortable with an Obama presidency. But there are also strong reasons for Democrats to still fear Republican sway over the electorate. First, polls can be very misleading. The advantage Democrats enjoy on a range of issues does not necessarily suggest a complete revolution in the thinking of the electorate. Being preferred on an issue like the economy does not necessarily mean that the rhetoric of small government is dead. When Sarah Palin was selected as McCain's running mate, for example, he immediately enjoyed a 20-30 point boost in issues like the economy and Iraq despite making no changes to his policies. Sometimes, the electorate views issues through the prism of something otherwise undetectable by polls and incalculable in datasets. Thus just as voters once sported Palin-coloured glasses, it may be that right now the economic crisis and feel-good election has them sporting Democratic-coloured glasses but not necessarily demonstrating some ideological victory. Second, this election still has not proven that the cultural wedges Republicans have used for the last 30 years do not work. It only proves that in a quagmire of failed strategies and terrible economic news, appeals to issues like gay marriage, socialism and abortion are overpowered by more \"bread and butter\" issues. As the passage of anti-gay marriage statutes in three states proves, Americans are still beholden to traditional cultural and religious influence in ballot box. Third, the pillars of the Republican attack machine still control talk radio and Fox News. While their influence has been humbled by electoral defeat, right-wing media still have considerable power to generate controversy and capitalise on Democratic missteps. There is no indication that the political demagoguery championed by Rush Limbaugh is a dead art, and in many parts of the US, he still can rally the troops. The potential still exists for conservatives to once again define the issues through the prism of the culture wars, used to great effect as part of Ronald Reagan's southern strategy. But this presents a larger question surrounding Obama's victory: does his election represent a cultural shift in the electorate beyond changing demographics? Has Obama changed the way politics and culture intersect? Obama may have buried the southern strategy and reshaped the electorate's thought process in fundamental ways. In terms of his message, Obama sold progressive policies as being for the middle class, rather than just for the poor, and portrayed Republican policies as skewed toward the rich, which altered the political calculus of voters. Small government sounded more elitist and less like the foundation of a keep-wealth-among-your-own-kind tax policy. Redistribution does not sound like a bad idea when it is presented as an issue of fairness, rather than on cultural grounds. Moreover, by electing an African-American candidate, the potential exists for the electorate to truly conceptualise racial issues differently in America. Giving African-American students greater access to education and opportunity may look less like welfare than an investment in our nation's future. Who is the next Barack Obama? What great artists and politicians in our nation's inner cities are being lost to a lack of opportunity? Obama's meteoric rise also reaffirms a belief in this nation that overcoming injustice is something that all Americans can feel good about. To the extent that helping a small group realise their aspirations reflects the goals and ambitions of us all, Obama's election reignites a progressive narrative whose effects will be enduring well beyond this election. If Obama does not signal a meaningful shift in cultural attitudes in America then traditional Republican cultural weapons are still formidable and will require a great deal of caution and political armour to defend against. But if America is getting more heterogeneous not only demographically but also in its political consciousness, and our society is beginning to view religion and culture as less rigid requirements for inclusion in \"real America\", then cultural arguments in politics will become less effective. Arguments that equate patriotism with an unquestioning attitude toward American policies will seem out of touch with the problems facing our nation and the world. Under this scenario, Republican power will only be revived if they craft an entirely new message that is broader in appeal. However, the final element that will determine the future of progressives is what they make of this opportunity. More powerful than attitudes or demographics are actual results. Will America under Obama be a happier, wealthier and more inclusive society? The answer to that question will no doubt be more determinative of the future than any structural arguments about the electorate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
