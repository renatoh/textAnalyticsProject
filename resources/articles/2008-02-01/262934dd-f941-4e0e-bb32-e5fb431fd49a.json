Nine years after they won their last trophy, Tottenham are collecting silverware again and, as it was in 1999, the League cup was secured by a one-goal margin at Wembley. Then it was Allan Neilsen, this time it was Jonathan Woodgate, the England defender rising to meet Jermaine Jenas's free-kick three minutes into the first-half of added time and heading into an open net after the up-to-then-imperious Peter Cech had come for the ball but not collected. He was left stranded, Spurs were left delirious. This victory will be celebrated in north London for some time and not just because it finally gives those in charge of the White Hart Lane trophy cabinet a reason to turn the key and add to the haul. Tottenham came into this contest against hated London rivals as underdogs and after Didier Drogba had given Chelsea the lead on 38 minutes, it appeared as if the pre-match predictions would bear out as planned. In fairness to Juande Ramos's side, they had started brightly and had the first decent effort on goal when, after only 25 seconds, Robbie Keane scorched through the Chelsea rearguard only to see his shot blocked by John Terry. Abram Grant's side were on the ropes but by no means winded and, as expected, it was they who took the lead. Drogba scored from a free-kick he had won after being fouled by Didier Zokora on the edge of the box. The Ivorian took range from 25-yards and fired, his shot was accurate but not exactly deadly and only beat Paul Robinson because the goalkeeper was positioned too far across to the other side of the goal. His future is once again a matter of reasonable debate. The rest of the half offered little in terms of drama, a theme which continued into the second half. Two sides which have promised entertainment appeared to be adding to Wembley's main drab affairs. But then Wayne Bridge, quite literally, handed Tottenham a way back into the match. The full-back reached out illegally to stop Aaron Lennon from advancing on 69 minutes and after consultation with the assistant referee, Mark Halsely pointed to the spot. Dimitar Berbatov stepped forward in front of his own fans, most of whom were openly praying for the Bulgarian to score. He did not let the pressure get to him and calmly rolled the ball past Cech for his 17th goal of the season. There was tension right until the end and extra-time was no surprise. That it was Woodgate who would get the winner was; it is the defender's first for his new club. Saloman Kalou had a chance to equalise seven minutes from the end but Robinson redeemed himself and blocked with his boots."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
