Has it changed much? Andrew Herbert: We've nearly doubled in size in the same building, but the ethos and the style of the laboratory has hardly changed at all: I think Roger built a fantastic lab. He had some key values: trust your researchers to do great stuff, and don't get in their way. Roger always said that a manager is a resource, and that's precisely how I see my role. Researchers come to me when they want something and I make sure they get it. In fact, if I'm really doing my job properly, they get it slightly before they know they want it. TG: You were out of research before, so how did you get the job? AH: A quick career history is: PhD at Cambridge with Roger working on operating systems. I then went off and ran an Alvey project defining object standards, and that went very well. As the web came along I spun out a startup that was acquired by Citrix, and I was their director of advanced technology for about four years. I'd stayed in Cambridge throughout doing all these things, and then one day Roger rang me and said: \"Do you want to come back into research?\" It took me about a millisecond to decide \"yes!\". So I took over the assistant directorship at the lab. TG: How much freedom do you have in picking your research areas? AH: Essentially total freedom. When I joined we were into programming languages and tools, machine learning, and I took over systems and networks. Those are still the three strengths of the lab. When I joined, Roger and I decided we were not quite so strong in applications, so we decided to go out and find someone to start a fourth group, and we found a guy called Ken Wood. His interests are human-computer interaction and consumer devices and electronics, and that's how we got our fourth group. TG: And that's been a great group for attracting publicity, with people like Lyndsay Williams. AH: Yes, I'm wearing one of her SenseCams now! We're almost into produc tion with these: I think we've built over 250 for the research community. TG: We covered SenseCam in a piece about \"life-caching\", where you record your whole day automatically and play it back later (How to save your life, August 19, 2004). But the whole idea hasn't taken off the way I thought it would. AH: It's still trundling down the runway, I think is the tactful answer. We have two things going with the SenseCam. One is how you might tie it into things like blogging. The other side is the medical side, with Addenbrookes [Hospital]. That really has taken off. We've found that using SenseCam helped memory-loss patients recover their memories, which is nice. Now neurophysicists are getting involved because it's helping them to test and confirm some of their theories about how we remember and what the mechanisms might be. We've found that using those techniques, you can improve recall for people who don't have memory loss problems, so SenseCams can help all of us with our recall. I find that when I get home, skimming through the flickering SenseCam thing is just the perfect way ... TG: Or you can just give it to your wife and say ... AH: \"That was my day!\" TG: Yours in 90 seconds. AH: We're also finding teenagers are looking at it as a new media because it's not photographs and it's not a video, and in some ways its jerkiness reflects the pace of what's going on. TG: But SenseCam and other cute gadgets are still research. How do you convert research into products? AH: Part of the Microsoft Research organisation is a technology transfer team. We have one that works globally and is run from the Redmond lab. We jokingly call them the spy network. They go round the rest of the company, and their role is to understand what the product divisions are doing and what their technical challenges are. They talk to the architects and chief designers and product managers and form a view based on what they know, and where research might help or sometimes even challenge the product groups, if we think they are using a wrong technique. So the team knows what's going on in research and they know the product groups so they try and build relationships. Then technology transfer takes place in all sorts of ways. It works quite well. The other thing we do now is think about licensing technologies to Microsoft partners. The most recent example of that is a program called IP Ventures, where we contribute intellectual property and work with venture capitalists to create a company and take an idea to market. That's been quite exciting. TG: Have there been any notable successes in getting UK research into products? AH: Yes, there's the network mapper in Vista - that was done in Cambridge. There's an algorithm called BM25F, which is about improving web search ranking by incorporating user behaviour. Search is obviously a big part of Vista, of Office, of Windows Live, so there we essentially just transferred a pile of Greek letters three inches long. We're also proud of Xbox Live's online ranking system, which helps you find opponents ... TG: Gamertags! AH: Absolutely! That was all done by our machine learning group, in the Cambridge lab. It is probably the world's largest online machine learning application. TG: In what way is it machine learning? AH: Because what we're trying to observe, as people play each other, is what is a good predictor of skill. We're seeing who plays who, what the outcomes are, and what is a statistical model of skill across the number of games, and so on. We're trying to build models of human behaviour, essentially. TG: Can I apply that to the Premiership and make a fortune from William Hill? AH: I couldn't possibly comment! We've done some interesting analysis with that, and there's a lot of randomness. We're computing skill for itself, we're not computing the outcome of matches. What we can do with a football league is make comments about how well balanced any particular match is likely to be. It's just like saying Arsenal and Man United is likely to be an interesting game, but it's not going to tell you what the score will be. Unfortunately, you can't make your fortune that way ... TG: Microsoft is spending about $6.6bn a year on R&amp;D. AH: But research is a tiny fraction of that. You can do the numbers: there's about 700 or so of us in research and about 20,000 in development? Bill [Gates] says it's remarkably good value! To the company, we're a batch of things: we're clearly a source of new technology and we're a source of smart people. So if Microsoft wakes up a little late to something, as sometimes happens, it's usually research that rises to the challenge. When someone said, \"Perhaps we ought to have our own search engine,\" it was Microsoft Research who set to and said: \"Here's how you build one.\" We also see one of our roles as to give the company agility, by researching things that don't relate to current products, and so on - things like computational biology and simulating biology. As a research lab, we're allowed and encouraged to go off on those tangents, because you never know. \u00b7 Curriculum vitae Age 52 Education BSc in computational science at the University of Leeds (1975) and a PhD in computer science from Cambridge University (1978).
