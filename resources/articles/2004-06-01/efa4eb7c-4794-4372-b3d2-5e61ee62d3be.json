The satellite broadcaster's shares rose 3.6%, to 634p, in trading this afternoon, as investors speculated that viewers attracted to the service could eventually switch to Sky's premium movie and sports subscription channels and boost revenues. Most other UK stocks either remained static or fell back in sluggish trading on the markets. The new Sky service, which will launch later this year, is seen as an effective and low-risk way of competing with the BBC-backed Freeview digital TV service. Freeview has so far been adopted by 3.5 million households since it launched in October 2002, and is now growing faster than Sky Digital's subscriber base. The decision to launch a free satellite service will also reassure the markets that BSkyB chief executive James Murdoch has a clear strategy for the company in the face of the challenge posed by Freeview. BSkyB's position in the market was also bolstered by news that it plans to develop a package of channels for high-definition televisions by 2006. HDTV is seen as the next major step forward for TV technology and is already being promoted in the US. BskyB's free digital service will be available for the cost of the installation of a satellite dish and receiver - around \u00a3150 - and allow viewers to pick up the five terrestrial channels and other stations including BBC3 and BBC4 without having to pay a subscription. Previously Sky had only offered paid-for services. The free package will include ITV, BBC1, BBC2, BBC3, BBC4, CBBC, CBeebies, News 24, BBC Parliament, Channel 4, Channel Five, ITV News, CNN and scores of other channels, although most of these are minority interest, such as Extreme Sports. The move will also be welcomed by the government, which aims to switch off the analogue TV signal by 2010. Earlier this year media regulator Ofcom identified the lack of a viable free-to-air satellite service - filling in the gaps in digital terrestrial coverage, particularly in rural areas - as one of the main barriers to achieving digital switchover. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
