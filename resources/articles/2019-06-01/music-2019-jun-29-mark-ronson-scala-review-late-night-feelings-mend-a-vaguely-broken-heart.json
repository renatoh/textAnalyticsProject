It says so on the outside of the wooden crate that takes this large, cracked mirrorball out to the club nights the DJ and producer has been holding sporadically since last year. It sits in front of Ronson\u2019s DJ console, jaggedly reflecting the tutti-frutti light scheme. We\u2019re in a long-serving King\u2019s Cross venue, rather than a place Ronson\u2019s usual clientele, the international jet set, might go to dance. The tinsel decor of his travelling Club Heartbreak is also a little makeshift. Ronson comes penultimate in a four-DJ lineup, most of whom spin a series of \u201csad bangers\u201d \u2013 the go-to phrase sums up Ronson\u2019s fifth studio album, Late Night Feelings, a record that finds the transatlantic super-producer dancing with tears in his eyes. Tonight he starts off wearing a leather jacket with the broken mirror ball motif on the back, but soon strips off to reveal a Faith-era George Michael T-shirt beneath as he does sweaty battle with a pair of headphones. It\u2019s hard to imagine such a gilded, A-list Insta-life actually laid low by intimate pain \u2013 not least because the waters in which successful creatives swim supply all sorts of analgesic possibilities, and plenty more fish. But there is something convincing in the notion that Ronson\u2019s 2017 divorce from Jos\u00e9phine de La Baume, his wife of five years created an internal blemish in an otherwise hunky-dory existence. Pain, Ronson\u2019s fifth album indirectly posits, is universal; a great leveller and, arguably, a far more fruitful space from which to draw creatively than the beautiful people\u2019s party music that has been Ronson\u2019s recent stock-in-trade. Ronson plays many of his own songs tonight, not least his \u201cfavourite\u201d from the new album, the Angel Olsen-powered True Blue, which imports Olsen\u2019s trademark reverberating sound wholesale into Ronson\u2019s ambit. (He allegedly first heard her music through the wall of a pilates studio.) But there\u2019s no room for Uptown Funk, the Bruno Mars-fronted monster that renewed Ronson\u2019s commercial cachet: too, well, \u201cup\u201d. Ronson doesn\u2019t sing at all on Late Night Feelings, but entrusts the vocals to an all-female cast. It\u2019s a list that makes a lot of sense: Los Angeles Swede Lykke Li \u2013 made famous by one of the most anguished bangers of recent times, I Follow Rivers (2011) \u2013 and an even more recent bard of contemporary longing, Camila Cabello. It\u2019s really not a bad record: united in theme and varied enough in treatment not to outstay its welcome, Late Night Feelings is the latest in Ronson\u2019s attempts to steer pop away from ever more crass ear-grabbing tropes. On this count you believe him, up to a point. When he teamed up with fellow super-producer Diplo last year as Silk City, though, Ronson seems to have had few such scruples: Electricity \u2013 their hit with Dua Lipa \u2013 is no aural wallflower. But tonight Ronson is punting something a little more retro: this DJ set, like his album, eschews the latest sounds for a mashup of tried and tested glitter-as-medicine. This new overtly disco direction might have legs, too. He\u2019s had meetings recently with Diana Ross, the queen of disco, to discuss her next album. It\u2019s significant, though, that Ronson kicks off his hour-long set with I Can\u2019t Stand the Rain by Ann Peebles, famously sampled by Missy Elliott and Timbaland for Elliott\u2019s 1997 hit The Rain. Long before Ronson was the producer winning Grammys for his work on Lady Gaga\u2019s career-rescuing Joanne, or Electricity, he spent the late 90s DJ-ing for the New York hip-hop crowd. \u201c\u2018What the fuck are you playing, white boy?\u2019\u201d was frequently \u201ca verbatim quote\u201d, remembers Ronson in a recent issue in Interview magazine, where he was grilled (very gently) by Rashida Jones, who was his partner in those days. Ronson\u2019s understanding and respect for hip-hop\u2019s constituent parts \u2013 the soul samples, the grooves \u2013 endeared him to the rap scene. They ended up being the bedrock of his career. \u201cAmy taught me a lot about heartbreak,\u201d Ronson says, before spinning Winehouse\u2019s evergreen, ever-blue Back to Black. Before Ronson was in cahoots with the bling likes of Mars, he was a sensitive enabler in league with soul revivalists the Dap-Kings. He urged Winehouse \u2013 then a jazz singer who Island Records wanted to turn into a pop star \u2013 to write what she felt. The result was a one of the biggest albums of the 00s, and the making of Ronson\u2019s reputation, after his minor hit, 2003\u2019s Ooh Wee. Tonight\u2019s set comes five days after the release of Late Night Feelings; Ronson and a few of the album\u2019s vocalists will soon be bound for Glastonbury. Unspoken hopes exist that tonight\u2019s \u201cspecial guests\u201d might include some of the album\u2019s shinier stars: maybe Miley Cyrus, who sings the album\u2019s most ubiquitous cut, Nothing Breaks Like a Heart, and is expected at Worthy Farm. Cyrus did turn up to the last London iteration of Club Heartbreak last December, but doesn\u2019t show tonight; Ronson makes the best of her absence. In an outbreak of cheesy brio, he plays Nothing Breaks Like a Heart, interrupting it with Lil Nas X\u2019s country trap hit, Old Town Road, which showcases Miley\u2019s dad, Billy Ray Cyrus. From there, Ronson segues into Jolene, the Dolly Parton standard that provided inspiration for Nothing Breaks Like a Heart. Nothing about this is particularly cutting edge. But it leaves you with a big grin on your face, where the mascara was previously running for Winehouse. Ronson\u2019s newer talent is in the house, however \u2013 starting with New York\u2019s King Princess, signed to Ronson\u2019s record label and about to release her own debut album. She bounces around while Ronson plays her catchy-enough Pieces of Us. Yebba, a previously unknown Arkansas soul singer, arrives with a pair of backing vocalists to sing Don\u2019t Leave Me Lonely, one of the record\u2019s standout tracks. A disco-soul anthem-in-waiting held up by an unexpected reggaeton shuffle, it supplies guts and grace to an album that doesn\u2019t disappoint, but somehow doesn\u2019t quite end up a classic. The problem with Late Night Feelings is revealed by the DJ set. It\u2019s small but significant. The hurt here is vague and the music not dramatic enough. Ronson spins the title track with its scything disco strings and its nagging \u201con and on and on\u201d chorus and it totally convinces as wistful party music. But truly great heartbreak songs deal in specifics: flaming locks of auburn hair, eyes of emerald green. Or, as Winehouse put it, in one of pop\u2019s great opening salvos: \u201cHe left no time to regret/Kept his dick wet/With his same old safe bet.\u201d The best Late Night Feelings can come up with is one sole occasion when Cyrus nails a place and time: \u201cRemember what you said to me,\u201d she asks, \u201cWe were drunk in love in Tennessee?\u201d Late Night Feelings deals in generalisation, and pain is horribly specific."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
