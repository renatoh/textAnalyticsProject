Co-founder and COO Brooks Buffington wrote on the company\u2019s website that Yik Yak \u201cmay share information with law enforcement\u201d in a blog post attacking recent threats of violence made using the service at the University of Missouri, notably one allegedly posted by St Louis resident Hunter Park, who was arrested on Wednesday morning \u201cfor making a terroristic threat\u201d. Spokeswoman Hilary McQuaid said the network exercised its discretion over when to turn information over to law enforcement liberally: \u201cYik Yak cooperates with law enforcement and works alongside local authorities to help with investigations,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cWe may provide information without a subpoena, warrant or court order when a post poses a risk of imminent harm.\u201d Yik Yak works differently from other social networks: rather than being keyed to users\u2019 names and digital credentials, the mobile app is anonymous and allows users to post messages that can be read by people in their immediate areas. As such, the app has endured public scolding over users\u2019 proclivity towards consequence-free anonymous hate speech (often at universities, and sometimes directed at teachers). Eastern Michigan University professor Margaret Crouch was so upset by the sexually graphic nature of remarks directed at her using the app that she told her union representative she was close to seeking legal redress. \u201cI have been defamed, my reputation besmirched,\u201d she wrote, according to the New York Times. \u201cI have been sexually harassed and verbally abused.\u201d Now, the company appears to have had enough. \u201c[T]here\u2019s a point where discussion can go too far \u2013 and the threats that were posted on Yik Yak last night were both upsetting and completely unacceptable,\u201d wrote Buffington. \u201cLet\u2019s not waste any words here: This sort of misbehavior is NOT what Yik Yak is to be used for. Period. It is not condoned by Yik Yak, and it violates our Terms of Service [emphasis in original].\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
