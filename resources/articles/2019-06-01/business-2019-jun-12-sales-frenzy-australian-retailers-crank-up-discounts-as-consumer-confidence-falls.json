Two closely followed surveys published on Wednesday by leading banks both pointed to a growing reluctance among shoppers to part with their hard-earned money in the face of flatlining wage growth, falling house prices and record household debt accumulated in the boom years. Mia Steiber, shopping expert at Finder.com, a price comparison site that offers hundreds of discount deals from leading brands, said retailers have gone into a \u201csales frenzy\u201d for the winter season and that some of the discounts are \u201cunusually big\u201d. Among the top discounters is the fashion website The Iconic, which is promoting 60% off 35,000 items, while the sports chain Rebel is offering 50% off men and women\u2019s shoes and 30% off all clothing. In the department store segment, David Jones is offering 50% off homewares and bedding. The offers do not stop at fashion, however, with car dealers advertising substantial discounts on new models. Holden dealers, for example, are offering a new Trax LS SUV for $24,500, representing a saving of up to $5,000 in some states and including three years\u2019 worth of free scheduled servicing, according to whichcar.com.au. Steiber said recent trends showed that Australians did not like to shop if items were not on sale. \u201cWe as shoppers have been programmed to know that if something isn\u2019t on sale, it will be soon enough \u2013 particularly in times of economic uncertainty,\u201d she said. \u201cSome people complain about \u2018sales fatigue\u2019, but the reality is when retailers stop offering discounts, customers stop buying. We saw a lull in early 2018 in sales and the drop in purchases was astounding.\u201d Jonathan Brown, spokesperson for the consumer website Choice, said that marketing by retailers had gone into \u201coverdrive\u201d in order to boost the bottom line. \u201cRetailers are trying to fill the year with lots of different sales events, but we have to remember that it\u2019s all about clearing their shelves and warehouses and shoring up their finances.\u201d He said that many Australians were feeling the pinch because of rising energy and healthcare costs. \u201cMany Australians are feeling financially stretched by the impact of rising health insurance costs. We found three in five Australians are worried about their level of disposable income and the rising cost of health and essential services seems to be playing a part, leaving less room for retail purchases.\u201d The sales rush comes after the Reserve Bank was forced to cut interest rates last week in response to sluggish economic growth and the threat of a downturn not seen in Australia for nearly three decades. Despite the cut in the cash rate to 1.25%, the lowest on record, consumer confidence fell over the weekend, according to the ANZ-Roy Morgan index. It declined by 2% from the previous week in the second consecutive decrease, with respondents\u2019 perception of the country\u2019s current economic conditions slumping 7.8%. The Westpac-Melbourne Institute consumer sentiment index dipped 0.6% to 100.7 in June from 101.3 in May, the bank said on Wednesday. The bank described the result as \u201cdisappointing\u201d. The surveys came after figures last week showed that retail sales fell 0.1% in April, compared with growth of 0.2% predicted by economists. Spending on household goods fell by 0.9%, suggesting that falling house prices were subduing shoppers\u2019 appetite for bigger ticket items. People also spent less on eating out and takeaway meals, while clothing, footwear and personal accessory retailing dropped by 1.2% for the month. Russell Zimmerman, the executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said the lead-up to the federal election had seen a big slowdown in retail traffic and a lack of confidence among consumers. \u201cRetailers are very aware that they need to get dollars through the tills and they have reacted with big discounts over the Queen\u2019s birthday weekend,\u201d he said. Retailers were increasingly trying to use social media to engage shoppers in different ways, as reflected in Wesfarmers\u2019 decision to pay $230m for the online retailers Catch Group on Wednesday. The Perth-based owner of Coles and Bunnings said it would use insights from Catch\u2019s technology platform and data capabilities to boost Wesfarmers\u2019 other retail operations. Zimmerman said: \u201cRetailers are trying to build confidence in consumers but that confidence extends from government. Now that the government has been re-elected it is their job to ensure there is plenty of work, so it\u2019s about infrastructure, infrastructure, infrastructure to get the country moving.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
