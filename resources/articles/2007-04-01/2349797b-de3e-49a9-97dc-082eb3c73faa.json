He may be more Bean than Bond, but he needed the money", "bodyText": "Poor seaman Arthur Batchelor of HMS Cornwall. There he was, aged 20, hardly a grown-up, never been on a plane before, an orphan brought up by his older sister, captured by heavily armed Iranians, flown off, blindfolded and placed in solitary confinement. He didn't know when or if he'd ever get home again and probably thought he was about to be shot dead. But he survived. Perhaps only the first few days were terrifying, then once he'd said what the Iranians wanted him to say, things mellowed out, and it was all lolling on the carpet with his mates eating yummy Middle Eastern food and playing games. He even received a smart new Iranian suit. Naturally, he thought the worst was over. He wasn't dead. He perhaps expected to return to relief and affection from his compatriots. But instead he came home to a humiliating stinker's welcome: criticism, mockery, hostility and even rude personal remarks. Highly paid columnists and military personnel considered him cowardly and unattractive. He was Mr Bean - a pathetic joke creature - and should never have accepted money for his story. Why not? It's time to give the boy a break. What did he do wrong? He didn't betray the country or spill any secrets. He's not Daniel Craig, but he's not bad-looking. And it was rather a stingy payment. He is reported to have received \u00a310,000 from the Daily Mirror, which may be a snip to his critics - Colonel Bob Stewart, General Sir Michael Rose and Major General Sir Patrick Cordingley - but to Arthur is a lifesaver. He says he can pay off his own and his sister's debts, and have driving lessons - a modest aim. And why shouldn't he blub in his cell? I would have done. I'd probably have cried the minute I was first flicked on the neck, as he was. A flick on your neck is fine if a chum in the playground does it, but not a man with a gun whom you can't see. Who knows what that flicking meant? I suspect that when one is terrified, alone, blindfolded and surrounded by strangers with guns, the imagination tends to go into overdrive. Especially if Arthur's leaders had told him that Iranians were not always friendly and kind. What is all this stiff-upper-lip crap anyway? I thought it was all over but Michael Heseltine is still banging on about \"the concepts of restraint, solidarity, fortitude and self-sacrifice on which the effectiveness of the military depends\". But how many hundreds of thousands of young men stiffened their lips, went \"over the top\" and sacrificed themselves between 1914-18, and for what? Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori (it is sweet and seemly to die for one's country), goes the old lie. It wasn't then and it isn't now. I often blub with fright, even in the safety of my own home. Never mind a darkened cell. More bonkers research from Cambridge University. Professor Martin Jones suggests that eating in front of the television is \"a natural consequence of human evolution\" - a sort of \"virtual campfire\" situation, where one may \"share food\" and \"tell stories\". Not in my house it isn't. If I'm watching telly while eating, I don't want someone yakking on and spoiling my favourite programme. Same with Daughter. I'm not allowed to talk through Shipwrecked; she's not allowed to talk through EastEnders. So we have to have the telly off. And what sort of a \"campfire\" is that? You don't have to run about expending energy, searching the woods, gathering twigs and burning up calories. If we're going to have a campfire, then we still want the real Ray Mears style - the excitement of the outdoors, the twiddling of sticks to light the fire (all right, use matches if you must), poking the sausages or grilling the grubs. We want crackling flames, sparks flying into the night sky. We don't want to be blobbing in front of the screen, growing fatter and lumpier and doing our posture no favours. Much better to be sitting up nice and straight at table, chatting away and looking at one's family or friends, rather than flinging the odd sideways remark at them in the adverts. And I don't know about you, but there's no fresh air, prowling wolves or snakes in our house. The only wildlife we have at our television dinners are the dogs, whingeing and slobbering away, begging for snacks. Professor Jones argues that we are now part of a global community and, as world events become more relevant to our lives, it is natural to dine in front of the television and discover information as we eat. I can see it now. \"Oh, look at that selection of mutilated victims of the latest catastrophic and pointless war, flood damage, crazed tyrant, dead polar bears, deluded megalomaniac president, knife/gun crime victim. What do you think of that? Pass the salad.\" Personally, I like to dine alone in front of the telly, eating my baked potato fairly briskly in a glum way, crying or shouting at the screen, with no one looking and mocking. Meanwhile, I was eating my toast this morning in front of the breakfast news, and I noticed the Green Goddess pointing out that the elderly are now more active and healthier than the young. We were less stressed, she said. We worked hard \"but we also played hard\". I bet she meant round the real campfire. \u00b7 This week Michele read The Sex Life of my Aunt by Mavis Cheek: \"Light but substantial.\" Michele watched Lost in Translation: \"What was all that about? Alienation? Or nothing in particular. And why begin with Scarlett's bottom?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
