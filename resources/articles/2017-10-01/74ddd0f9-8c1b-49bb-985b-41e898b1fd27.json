Jamie Harron, 27, from Stirling, touched down at Glasgow airport on a flight from Dubai where he was met by his family and friends. \u201cIt feels very good, I\u2019m very happy to be home,\u201d he told reporters. When asked what he would do first when he got home he said: \u201cGet in a good bed, because I\u2019ve been sleeping on my mate\u2019s couch for three and a half months. It\u2019s been a total shambles. It\u2019s just total shock I feel. I can\u2019t believe its been four months.\u201d The electrician had been accused of putting his hand on a man\u2019s hip in the Rock Bottom bar. He said that he only did this to avoid spilling a drink in a crowded bar when he brushed past a man. He was sentenced in absentia to 30 days in prison for failing to appear at court, for making a rude gesture and drinking alcohol. This led to him being imprisoned for five days, before he was bailed and his passport confiscated. After international criticism, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum, the United Arab Emirates prime minister and ruler of Dubai, intervened personally and exonerated Harron. Harron said he has not ruled out going back to the UAE despite his ordeal. \u201cI would go back through work once everything has been cleared for me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going back in a hurry but I would go back later on. I think I\u2019ve been caught up in a bad situation. I didn\u2019t see light at the end of the tunnel to be honest.\u201d Harron had been working in Afghanistan and was on a two-day stopover in the United Arab Emirates this summer. Radha Stirling, chief executive of the Detained in Dubai advocacy group, thanked Mohammed in a statement. \u201cThis was a courageous and honourable decision on the part of Sheikh Mohammed,\u201d she said. \u201c[Although] it highlights the urgent need for judicial reform in the country, it is also a hopeful sign that the United Arab Emirates\u2019 leadership possesses the will and vision to pursue such reforms in the future.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
