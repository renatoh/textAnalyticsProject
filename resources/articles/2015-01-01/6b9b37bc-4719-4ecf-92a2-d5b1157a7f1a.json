The team\u2019s predicament a year ago, when they languished second bottom of the Premier League with a hefty injury list and a two-leg League Cup semi-final against Manchester City still to come, had prompted Allardyce to make nine changes, switch formation and hand three youngsters their senior debuts for West Ham\u2019s FA Cup third-round tie at Nottingham Forest of the Championship last season. The Hammers were duly humiliated 5-0 at the City Ground, with 3,000 travelling fans calling for the manager to be sacked, with the priority clear to retain top-flight status. Yet a stronger squad \u2013 bolstered by the arrival of Enner Valencia, Alex Song, Morgan Amalfitano, Aaron Cresswell, Carl Jenkinson, Cheikhou Kouyat\u00e9 and Diafra Sakho, who have all contributed heavily \u2013 has flourished this term and Sunday\u2019s 3-0 victory over West Bromwich Albion left them seventh and only four points from the Champions League places with an away FA Cup tie against League One opponents, Bristol City, to come on Sunday. \u201cIt was important to get back to winning ways because we hadn\u2019t won in four matches in the Premier League,\u201d said Allardyce. \u201cIt gives us a great opportunity to focus on Bristol City [in the fourth round of the FA Cup], make sure we get through to fifth round. That is very important to us because our position in the league is very secure. We don\u2019t have to consider resting players with one eye on Premier League results. \u201cWe\u2019ve come through the hardest period of all, Christmas and the new year, with games every three or four days, and are steering clear of injuries well. That gives us a chance to go forward in both the Premier League and the FA Cup.\u201d Bristol City have enjoyed a fine first half to their own season, and are currently second in League One behind Swindon only on difference, but will face a West Ham side who are also unbeaten to date this year. Allardyce puts the improvement this time round \u2013 his team have twice as many points as they did at the same stage last year \u2013 down to the key additions made to the squad in the summer window. \u201cThere\u2019s one thing you will realise: recruitment is everything in the world of football,\u201d he added. \u201cYou recruit well, you become a great manager. Better players do better things, take things on board quicker, get better results. Our recruitment this year has been fantastic. To have so many players make such a difference in one season\u2019s recruitment is the best I\u2019ve ever had in my entire career.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
