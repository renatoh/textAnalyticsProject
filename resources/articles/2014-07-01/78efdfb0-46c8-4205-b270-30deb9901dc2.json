But nothing can explain (or excuse) the sheer skull-scraping ugliness of this relentlessly tacky Britain's Got Talent spin-off. The story nominally follows a dysfunctional family's move to the country with a sausage-hungry dog (abysmally voiced by David Walliams) in tow, and a lairy lord of the manor (John Sessions, channelling Uncle Monty) in waiting. Morris dancing, teet-pulling and mud-splashing ensue to thoroughly depressing effect. If you paid to see this, you would feel duty-bound to demand your money back; I saw it for free and still wanted a refund.
