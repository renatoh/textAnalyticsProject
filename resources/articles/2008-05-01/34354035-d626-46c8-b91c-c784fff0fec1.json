Flintoff would need to prove his fitness in the championship match against Yorkshire at Headingley Carnegie, which begins on May 28, but Watkinson admitted: \"I don't think he'll be back for the Roses match.\" Flintoff's attempted Lord's comeback was thwarted by a side strain and opportunities are now running out for him to re-establish himself in the England side before the South Africa series. His next target is Lancashire's championship match against Nottinghamshire at Old Trafford, which begins on June 6, a day after the start of the third Test against New Zealand at Trent Bridge. After that, the counties embark upon three weeks of Twenty20 cricket and England play a one-day series against New Zealand, neither of which are perfect settings for him to ease himself back into the England squad. Watkinson said that Lancashire's prompt identification of Flintoff's side strain at the end of their championship match against Durham last week prevented a potential calamity. \"We nipped what could have been a serious injury in the bud,\" he said. \"By acting so quickly, two or three weeks' rest should be enough to cure it.\" Lord's is to undergo an extensive development programme which will cost \"north of \u00a3200m\" and see 10,000 seats added to the current capacity of 28,500. Floodlights will also be erected that can be dismantled at the end of the season. The MCC intend to unveil their detailed plans during next year's Ashes Test at the ground. But to pay for the ambitious project they plan to build flats and possibly a hotel behind the Nursery ground.Apart from the pavilion, the Mound Stand and the Grand Stand, the ground will be extensively rebuilt. That means the work will concentrate on the Tavern, Warner, Allen and Compton and Edrich stands. Lord's currently stages two of the summer's seven Tests and Keith Bradshaw, the MCC's chief executive, said yesterday: \"We're doing everything we can to keep those matches. For the good of the game in England it's important that the iconic venues like Lord's are developed into world-class modern stadia.\" The MCC are also investigating the possibility of building a car park, a cricket academy and banqueting facilities beneath their premises. However, the MCC will first have to convince their members that the plans are in the interests of the club. Representatives have already visited Edinburgh and Cardiff to \"sell\" the idea to some of the more far-flung members. Local residents will also be consulted. Five architects - Hopkins, BDP, David Chipperfield, Dixon Jones and Herzog &amp; de Meuron - have been shortlisted for the project and will make their presentations by May 30. The MCC will make a decision on which firm to use by the end of June and hope that work will start in 2011. But they will have to work round the use of the ground for archery during the London Olympic Games in 2012. The England and Wales Cricket Board chief executive, David Collier, has said that a deal in excess of $100m (\u00a352m) is now in place for a series of winner-takes-all Twenty20 matches bankrolled by the Texan billionaire Sir Allen Stanford. \"The lawyers are still working on the small print but we have finalised our negotiations and everything is in place,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
