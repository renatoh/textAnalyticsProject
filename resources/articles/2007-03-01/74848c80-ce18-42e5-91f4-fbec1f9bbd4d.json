Some of the pieces, such as Have You Courage?, two versions of which are included in this collection, have a nationalistic flavour; others, such as The Rapids-Rider's Brides from 1897, have a quasi-operatic dramatic edge. One is a minor masterpiece. The Origin of Fire, for baritone, chorus and orchestra, is mature Sibelius. Like so many of Sibelius's works from Kullervo onwards, the inspiration and the text come from the Kalevala, an episode telling how the land is in darkness because the sun, moon and stars have been stolen, and how new light is created and then lost. The choral writing is straightforward but the grandeur of the piece is impressive, and Osmo Vanska, it hardly needs saying, paces it all perfectly. A memorable gem among the more or less forgettable other pieces."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
