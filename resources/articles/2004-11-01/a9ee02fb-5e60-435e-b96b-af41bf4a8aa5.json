A page put to bed is a good day's work for me; half a page is reason to be cheerful. With The Cryptographer, the best days were often those when I was combing through the words until they shone, untangling the knots to leave the story as clean and clear as I could make it. This was a process that frequently left fewer pages in the evening than I'd had in the morning, so that it felt as if I wasn't writing a book so much as unwriting one that had been waiting for me before I sat down to it. When I'm writing I'm quite cut off from the world, and I'm writing most of the time. I make space for my family and a few close friends, but on the whole I'm a pretty antisocial bastard. It's not only that writing consumes a great number of hours, but that the experience of writing is dislocatory. The sensation a reader may have of sinking into a story, of being so wonderfully cut off from the world, is the one I sit down to every morning. I know things are going well when I look up from the screen and realise it's grown dark outside - or even better, light - without my noticing. Many of the best days of my life have been spent alone, talking to the walls, muttering to myself in the voices of people who have never really lived and who, beyond the pages of my stories, never will. Writing is a powerful experience, and over the years, exposure to any source of power will have a deleterious affect on the human body. Scientifically speaking, this is why writers are weird. It may be that you've met a few writers and thought they seemed all right, quite nice if you ignored the clothes: in that case, be glad that you met them in a public place. Those clothes you were trying to ignore? They were put on that way on purpose. Even that thing that looked as if it was on backwards. Actually, what you witnessed wasn't the way writers really dress, but the way writers dress when they're trying to be normal. This is a generalisation only because some writers dress in order to seem abnormal - which, if you know any authors personally, might not seem such a difficult proposition. Usually they do this by dressing with the aid of a signature prop. It might be a trilby, a pocket full of fag butts or a shirt so bright television satellites could bounce wrestling matches off it, but all are intended to do the same job as Harold Wilson's pipe: they're there to make the nondescript memorable. The way writers dress when they're actually writing, of course, bears no resemblance to any of this. I like working at night. The sense that the city is asleep around me sharpens my thinking. I write in a west-facing room at home in north London, with the window open so I can get a sense of the weather, watch the sunset - when there is one - and listen to the people going past outside. The people in cities are compelling even when they seem dull or lifeless. Cricklewood has one of the most complex cultural mixes in London, which may well mean that in one sense it's the richest place in the world; its situation of endless flux is infuriating and invigorating. When we moved in the house was a wreck and infested with fleas, and I wrote with long, bloodstained white socks on my feet hanging through the floor, and a bucket of water beside me in which to drown the critters I caught in the act. I've always liked the idea of a writing shed. I read somewhere that Philip Pullman writes in a shed with a giant inflatable penguin beside him. I don't know what part the penguin plays in the creative process, but I like it. There's no great mystery to writing itself. It doesn't take a computer or the absence of one. Privacy helps. Anyone can write, just as anyone can sing; it's as if the human body has lyric and narrative cords strung alongside the vocal ones. The difference between singing something that has a nice echo in the bathroom and something that will affect people is important to me. Anyone can write for themselves, but the difficulty, the challenge and the greatest pleasure lies in writing for the pleasure of others. \u00b7 Tobias Hill is currently poet-in-residence in the Guardian Unlimited Books poetry workshop"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
