A third (34%) of 15-year-olds whose parents had little or no formal education claim no homework or almost none is ever set for them, compared with only 10% of those with graduate parents, according to the Sutton Trust, a charity which campaigns for increased social mobility. Researchers from Durham and Oxford Universities analysed two surveys which questioned thousands of schoolchildren, and found that the children of graduates were also over four times as likely to say they had more than 200 books in the home, two and a half times as likely to have a computer and twice as likely to attend daytime and after school clubs once a week. They were also much more likely to borrow books from a public library. The report argues these gaps are among the main reasons why there is a persistent divide between the achievement of middle class children and their less privileged counterparts. Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust, said: \"These results highlight the sheer range of obstacles facing non-privileged young people. Inequalities in the classroom are exacerbated by inequalities in their daily lives, whether this is lack of access to homework help, extra tuition or basic resources such as books and computers. All this serves to entrench low aspirations and underachievement.\" The Department for Children, Schools and Families said: \"We agree that disadvantaged children should have the same opportunities outside normal school hours as their better off classmates. \"It's a shame this report overlooks that more than 20,000 schools now offer study support and extra curricular activities outside normal class hours as part of the extended services programme \u2013 with every school expected to provide them by next September. \"The independent evidence is clear that extended services narrow the gaps, raise pupil attainment and cut exclusion rates.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
