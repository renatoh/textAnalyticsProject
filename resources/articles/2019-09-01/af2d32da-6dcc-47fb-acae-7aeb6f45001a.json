The club sit 18th in the Argentinian Superliga and are in danger of relegation. This will be Maradona\u2019s sixth stint as a club manager and his third in Argentina\u2019s top flight. Maradona\u2019s contract runs until the end of the current season. \u201cWith his last two teams, he succeeded in consolidating a clear and competitive playing style,\u201d said the club in a statement. After he was banned from football, or had his \u201clegs cut off\u201d as he put it, for doping at the 1994 World Cup, he hung up his boots, temporarily, to coach Textil Mandiy\u00fa who were relegated and later Racing Club for the 1995 Clausura. He was unsuccessful and was back to wearing the No10 for Boca Juniors again the following season. Maradona most recently failed to take Dorados de Sinaloa into Mexico\u2019s Liga MX from the second division. He later quit, citing health reasons. He coached Argentina at the 2010 World Cup but the team crashed out in the quarter-finals to Germany 4-0. His return to his homeland and its insatiable football media promises plenty of drama \u2013 a distraction from everyday life that some Argentinians will welcome. The country is experiencing economic and political turmoil as the peso continues to inflate at record levels heralding a depression with presidential elections looming."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
