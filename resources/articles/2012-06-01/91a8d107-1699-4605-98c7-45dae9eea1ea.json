He lost track of Balotelli for the game's opening goal and did not improve. His slip in the 75th minute presented Marchisio with a chance to make it 3-0 2/10 Philipp Lahm His concentration lapses, especially in the first half, epitomised Germany's sluggishness and he could not produce enough going forward to atone 4/10 Bastian Schweinsteiger Whether his passiveness was caused by nagging injury or unforgivable complacency, he was entirely bypassed in the first half. Improved in second period but still guilty of uncharacteristic moments of slackness, exemplified by failure to deliver free-kick into danger zone in the dying seconds 3/10 Sami Khedira After a positive start he was overshadowed by his Italian counterparts and could not become a significant influence 5/10 Toni Kroos Failed to justify his inclusion in the starting lineup, looking lightweight and inexperienced 3/10 Mesut Ozil Began brightly, ghosting between the lines, before fading as Italy took charge of the middle. Re-emerged as his team's most likely creator of chances in the second half but still not make enough inroads. Exquisite execution of the penalty 7/10 Lukas Podolski Did not have pace, trickery and imagination to trouble the Italian defence. Marco Reus was more incisive within minutes of replacing him 3/10 Mario Gomez Lacked sharpness and mobility and was easily contained by the defenders. Inevitably replaced at half-time 2/10 Substitutions Reus for Podolski (h-t), Klose for Gomez (h-t), M\u00fcller for Boateng (71) Italy Gianluigi Buffon Was uncharacteristically jittery but Germany did not put him under enough pressure to exploit it 5/10 Federico Balzaretti Also started nervously but soon settled and stifled Podolski. Made several superb clearances and one brilliant late tackle on Reus before giving away late penalty 7/10 Andrea Barzagli Commanded the centre of defence impeccably with Bonucci, preventing Gomez and then Klose from gaining any satisfaction 8/10 Leonardo Bonucci As diligent as his partner in the heart of the defence. On the one occasion a forward got the jump on him he compensated with a late-ditch tackle of great elegance 8/10 Giorgio Chiellini His positioning, energy and commitment were on par with those of his defensive team-mates, completing a high-class collective performance 8/10 Andrea Pirlo Not given quite as much space as against England but still pulled plenty of strings, occasionally inspired, never sloppy 7/10 Claudio Marchisio The pick of Italy's excellent midfielders, blending energy and finesse in exemplary fashion. Could have crowned it all with a goal following lovely exchange with Alessandro Diamanti midway through the second half 8/10 Riccardo Montolivo Continually broke up Germany's play with fine tackling, then used the ball shrewdly. Might have had a goal to show for impressive hour or so on the pitch but let fine first-half chance slip through dithering 8/10 Daniele De Rossi Dynamic, tidy and apt to conjure a cutting pass 8/10 Antonio Cassano Continually stretched the defence with his running and carried a regular threat. Wonderful cross for first goal 8/10 Mario Balotelli Produced a classic striking performance, combining power, intelligence, selfless running and superb finishing. A shame that cramp deprived him off a chance to complete a hat-trick 9/10 Substitutions Diamanti for Cassano (58), Motta for Montolivo (63), Di Natale for Balotelli (69)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
