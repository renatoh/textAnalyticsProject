Listeners have quickly taken offence at the track, which describes a woman \u201cswitching the lanes like a Bugatti Sport\u201d and having group sex. \u201cI read the lyrics first then tried to listen to the song but couldn\u2019t finish it,\u201d says Meg Murphy, of Bi-Pride, a campaign group for bisexual rights and visibility. \u201cIt felt incredibly fetishising. It reinforces the idea that bi women are there for men\u2019s titillation.\u201d It also implies that bi women are inherently sexual, engaging in a greater variety of sexual acts, which, she explains, \u201ccan sometimes be true \u2026 but isn\u2019t an inherent part of any sexual orientation.\u201d Plus the line about changing lanes makes bisexual people seem indecisive. Murphy explains that Payne\u2019s lyrics are harmful because they can encourage male listeners to expect bi women to perform for them. We saw the real-life consequences of how attitudes such as this can play out earlier this year, when two women, Chris (who is bisexual) and Melania (a lesbian), were attacked on a London bus after refusing when a group of men demanded they kiss for their entertainment. Meanwhile, government research has found that in the UK, bisexual women are more likely to experience sexual violence than straight or gay women. \u201cI think most representations of bisexuality until recently have been through the lens of straight men, or in porn, so we are viewed as overly sexualised,\u201d says Simone, 35, who is bisexual, and from Dubai. But there are other misconceptions too, she says: \u201cWhen you\u2019re bisexual, people always seem to tie your sexuality into who you\u2019re having sex with at the time \u2026 I\u2019ve been in a relationship with a man for 12 years, but that doesn\u2019t erase my bisexuality.\u201d Payne\u2019s song isn\u2019t the first time pop stars have failed us when it comes to bi representation. Last year, Rita Ora made an apology after Kehlani, Hayley Kiyoko and Shura were among those who criticised her song Girls for exploiting her own bisexuality. So how should pop get it right? Well, to start with, Payne should apologise, says Murphy. \u201cFor someone with his privilege and following he should be aware of his impact \u2013 and he should apologise so that young, bi fans don\u2019t have to feel that their identity is inherently sexualised.\u201d We also need to see more bisexual representation in videos, Murphy says. Isn\u2019t that difficult, though? If we see a woman kissing a woman, we assume she is gay, if we see her kissing a man, that she is straight. But that\u2019s just the point, says Murphy: \u201cIt\u2019s related to a wider societal problem around how we view bisexuality \u2013 and how we shouldn\u2019t be making assumptions about people\u2019s sexual identities.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
