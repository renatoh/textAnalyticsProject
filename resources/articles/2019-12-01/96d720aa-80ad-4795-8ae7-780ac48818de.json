Rashford\u2019s penalty in the victory over Manchester City in Saturday\u2019s derby took him to double figures in the Premier League for only the second time in his career despite more than half of the season remaining. With 16 goals for club and country so far the 22-year-old is enjoying by far his most prolific campaign since breaking into the United first team under Louis van Gaal in 2016, having been utilised mainly off the left flank by Solskj\u00e6r and the England manager, Gareth Southgate. Asked whether his performances in the victories over Tottenham and City had reminded him of the Juventus and Portugal forward Ronaldo, who scored 118 goals in 292 appearances for United between 2003 and 2009, Solskj\u00e6r said: \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to compare the two of them, yes. Both with skills, body shape, attitude, attributes \u2013 everything. The boy has every chance in the world to become a top, top player. Let\u2019s hope he continues like this.\u201d With United already assured of qualification for the last 32 of the Europa League, Rashford is likely to be rested for Thursday\u2019s meeting with AZ Alkmaar at Old Trafford, having racked up 13 goals in 21 appearances in all competitions this season. His pleas on social media for the Premier League to reconsider its decision not to award him a goal in the draw against Aston Villa when his header went in off the goalkeeper Tom Heaton have so far been ignored but Solskj\u00e6r believes there are still plenty more to come. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about the amount of goals,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as he keeps being positive and being direct and thinking about getting in front of the goal and getting chances, he\u2019ll score goals.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
