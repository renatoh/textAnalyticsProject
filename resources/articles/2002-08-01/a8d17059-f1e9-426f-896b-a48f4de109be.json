With the troubled publication at a crossroads after a year of redundancies and swingeing cost-cutting, the battle to succeed the retiring editor Conor Brady is heating up, with a leading firm of headhunters appointed to find the new person. It is understood that Irish Times managing director Maeve Donovan favours the appointment of an outsider, and has told colleagues she wants the paper to begin 'with a clean slate'. The job was advertised last week in the British and international press. Irish Times insiders are split over their choice of internal candidate. Peter Murtagh, the paper's foreign editor, is locked in a battle with news editor Cliff Taylor, managing editor Eoin McVey, and the only female candidate, political editor Geraldine Kennedy, for the post. But suggestions by insiders that the advertisement for the job is little more than a legal obligation have been rubbished by sources. Senior management figures have backed Donovan's belief that the post should go to someone with more than just good journalistic credentials. One of the more experienced candidates to emerge this weekend is an outsider. Alan Ruddock, the former editor of the Scotsman, is seen as the dark horse for the job. A former business editor of the Sunday Times, he persuaded Rupert Murdoch to launch the successful Irish edition of the Sunday Times in 1995. Previously, he was business editor of the Sunday Tribune. Ruddock, a 42-year-old Dubliner, educated at Trinity College, edited the Scotsman for two years, but resigned in 2000 after publisher Andrew Neil demanded the respected paper plunge downmarket to compete with the tabloid Scottish Daily Mail. One media commentator said: 'Ruddock has flair and the ability to effect gradual change without alienating staff. The Scotsman was an institution he was not prepared to have destroyed.' Others have tipped Irishman Rory Godson, the current business editor of the Sunday Times. Godson has privately told friends he is 'flattered' to be in the frame for the job. Brady, who is standing down after 16 years, will be in a strong position to influence the decision; he is staying on as a member of the board of directors and, unusually, he will also be on the interview panel that selects the man - or woman - who will follow him. Many of his staff are furious he is retaining so much power. They blame Brady for the financial crisis that almost overwhelmed the paper last year and cost 200 jobs. The choice of editor is seen as settling for another generation the balance of power between the 'bean-counters' and the 'keepers of the flame' of Irish Times tradition. Away from the newsroom, observers agree that the rivalry is about something else, and that whoever gets the job, the direction of the paper will not change. The Irish Times has an internal culture that cannot quickly be altered by one individual. When Conor Brady got the job in 1986 - the first Catholic to hold the position - he poured resources into the editorial side, opening offices in Beijing and New York. On the other hand, one of his predecessors, Fergus Pyle, was replaced when his leadership was judged to be unsuccessful. The Irish Times lore is that he was a great journalist, but an unwilling editor, pressed into the job to maintain the paper's Protestant tradition. And, just last year, Nick Chapman was forced out after less than two years as managing director. Nicknamed 'the English Impatient', Chapman railed against the paper's hierarchy and slow decision-making. So, if an individual cannot change the paper's core values, what is there to choose between the candidates? The answer may lie in the unfinished business of the survival plan agreed between management and unions earlier this year. When the crisis broke, management wanted a one-third reduction in staff to save \u20ac22m a year. The alternative was closure. Outside consultants called in by the unions agreed with the overall assessment. But the report found that the worst feather-bedding was at the topof the organisation. So far, 10 out of 35 senior editorial jobs have gone, and there are no more volunteers for the redundancy package. Management has agreed under pressure to a 'top down review', but union sources fear it is unrealistic to expect Brady's coterie to dismantle itself. Some members of the interview panel, like Brady, will favour an inside appointment - but three of the most influential members are new to their positions, and their views cannot be predicted. TCD professor David Connell is the chairman of the trust that owns the paper, former industrialist Brian Patterson is chairman of board of directors that runs the company, and Donovan is the new managing director. Roy Greenslade, media commentator for the Guardian, said: 'Whoever takes over will need to connect with the new younger Ireland. The Irish Times is important, but needs to articulate the concerns of a new generation.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
