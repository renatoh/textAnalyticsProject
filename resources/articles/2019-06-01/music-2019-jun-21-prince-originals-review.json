(Depressingly, his closest modern analogue in that respect is Ed Sheeran, a man spreading a considerably thinner gift thinner still.) Originals, a collection of Prince\u2019s guide demos for his funk proselytisers, shows the breadth and brilliance of his compositional talents \u2013 and also the judiciousness underpinning his own catalogue. It unspools like a greatest hits, even though few of the songs included were proper hits: the Bangles sell Manic Monday better than Prince does (bearing in mind these scratches weren\u2019t made for public consumption), largely because you believe Susanna Hoffs actually understood the workaday grind, and Prince sounds miffed by the very concept of it. His Nothing Compares 2 U coexists beautifully with Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor\u2019s version, finding hope and sensuality where she saw devastation. And he could easily have transformed some of the other tracks into chart fare: Jill Jones\u2019s coquettish Baby, You\u2019re a Trip pales next to his church organ-battering, throat-shredding psychedelic rhapsodics, and he pushes Holly Rock into more daring, vivacious territory than Sheila E did. He also shows up Kenny Rogers\u2019 pale take on You\u2019re My Love, sinking to deeper, soul-stirring notes almost worthy of Barry White. Sometimes Prince\u2019s limitations are revealed: he\u2019s no match for the deliciously supercilious Vanity 6 on Make-Up, and adds too much gothic melodrama to Noon Rendezvous, bettered by a suitably crushed-sounding Sheila E. But still \u2013 he wrote these songs, a fact that Originals drives home with his trademark casual confidence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
