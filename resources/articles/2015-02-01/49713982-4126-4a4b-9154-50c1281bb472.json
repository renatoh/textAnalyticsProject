Speaking on the day that he was unveiled as the new Villa manager, Sherwood said all the right things as he vowed to liberate the players on the pitch with a more gung-ho approach \u2013 \u201cLet\u2019s have a go fighting and start throwing a few punches ourselves\u201d \u2013 and turn Villa Park into the fortress he remembered from his playing days. He was typically forthright, no more so than when it was put to him that some have questioned whether he is the right man for the Villa role, given that his managerial experience amounts to only five and a half months in charge of Spurs. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of poor experienced managers,\u201d Sherwood replied. \u201cThere is a lot of good ones as well. I think it\u2019s overrated [the argument about a lack of experience]. My experience as a football manager has been very good up until now so I hope that continues.\u201d Spurs finished sixth under Sherwood \u2013 who was sacked at the end of the season \u2013 and his 59% win ratio is the highest of any manager at White Hart Lane in the Premier League era. It is his work in the club\u2019s academy, however, that gives him most satisfaction. \u201cI look back at my time at Tottenham in development as a great success. We produced a lot of footballers there: Ryan Mason, Harry Kane, Nabil Bentaleb, Danny Rose, Andros Townsend. There are players there worth a lot of money now. Something has been left behind there from me. And when I took the job I had success on the pitch.\u201d Although Sherwood has signed a three-year contract at Villa with the opportunity to implement a wider philosophy that encourages the development of younger players, he stressed that it is all about Premier League survival for the moment. Villa are 18th in the table with only two wins from their last 21 league games and Sherwood, who is yet to decide on an assistant manager, has targeted six victories to keep the club up. Asked whether he was putting his neck on the line, given Villa\u2019s perilous position, Sherwood replied: \u201cYeah, I think I am. But perversely I like the pressure of it. I quite like the fact that you\u2019re building it up like that.\u201d Pedestrian and toothless under Lambert, Villa will play on the front foot and attack with Sherwood in charge. \u201cWe saw that at Tottenham. When I took over there, the brief from Daniel Levy [the chairman] was: can we be a bit more attractive and can we score a few more goals? I ticked that box. I used Emmanuel Adebayor as the catalyst for that and we pretty much revolved all our play around him. It\u2019s possible it could be similar here [with Christian Benteke].\u201d Sherwood hopes that his experience with Adebayor, who flourished under his watch, will give him a head start with Benteke. \u201cYes, but it is not only the focus on that player. It is bringing that player back to life and also enhancing what is around him,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone has to recognise that. Yes, it was the case with Ade and it could possibly be the case with Christian and we hope it will be. We know what a threat he can be.\u201d The 46-year-old famously publicly tore into the Spurs players after a 4-0 defeat against Chelsea in March last year, and the answer he gave when asked whether he might do the same at Villa - \u201cWatch this space\u201d - suggested that he is not going to change his ways. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to be guilty of something it will be being honest. If they do well, they will be told, if they don\u2019t do well, they will also be told and told why. You have to be constructive. It can\u2019t be because of a referee\u2019s decision or if someone scores a 40-yarder and then everyone\u2019s crap. That ain\u2019t the case. You have to talk to them.\u201d More than anything there was a sense that Sherwood is looking forward to being viewed as a permanent manager, rather than someone who is keeping the seat warm for the next man. \u201cI was sitting at every press conference [at Spurs] and I kept getting told \u2018this man wants your job\u2019 and \u2018that man\u2019s been spoken to\u2019. It was every week. I dealt with it and got on with the job. It was difficult. What was I going to do? Roll in the corner and die? I\u2019m not going to do that. I\u2019m a fighter. I\u2019ll fight till the bitter end.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
