Lots of people suggested their own worst gigs, of which more later. But first off, honours must go to Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson, whose story about a urine-soaking at Shea stadium drew a bunch of comments that form a subsection in itself. CaressOfSteel fumed: \"How could anyone piss on Ian Anderson? The man is definitely a legend.\" Tigersoul, on the other hand, was less sympathetic: \"I've got one thing to say: welcome to New Fucking York City.\" Obviously lierbag is a connoisseur of the bad gig: \"I was surprised that Ian Anderson didn't mention the gig where he was hospitalised after a fan threw a rose on stage, whereupon one of the thorns got stuck in his eyeball. Hard to play Bouree on one leg after something like that.\" WSobchak weighed in with a simple plea: \"I wish Ian Anderson would write his memoirs.\" Go on, Ian, you know you want to ... The list of posters' worst-gig suggestions, though, was a long and entertaining one. If nothing else, this list of disasters and debacles demonstrates rock'n'roll's intimate relationship with intoxicants of all kinds. A not unexpected suggestion from linus76: \"Courtney Love in her new Hole lineup in Washington last June. She was late, on stage for almost three hours of rambling incoherence, the few tunes were few and far between, she forgot the lyrics. Her band got annoyed with her.\" HairyHighlander offered: \"The Dandy Warhols, Gold Coast, Big Day Out 2005. Barely got halfway through their set. Most if not all band members looked pretty pale and nauseous. They complained constantly about the heat and then swore to 'never again drink before one of these Aussie Big Day Out things.'\" Proving that a bad gig can sear you for life, thierrytt1 hauls out of the memory vaults: \"Free at Newcastle City Hall in the early 70s. Kossoff out of his face. The band started All Right Now half a dozen times but he never got the first riff right. They started to fight each other and then left the stage.\" LaCoccinelle: \"Saw Emerson Lake and Palmer in Birmingham between 1970-1972. One of them was so wrecked he could hardly stand up. And we paid good money for this rubbish.\" notangry: \"Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers, late 70s, Cheltenham Town Hall. Johnny could hardly stand up, apparently unable to find the strings on his guitar, or the microphone.\" On the film side of Film&amp;Music, most heat was generated by Peter Bradshaw's take on Super 8, the JJ Abrams homage to Steven Spielberg. Abrams is a beloved auteur of the fanboy constituency, so it's not surprising that one or two posters took issue with Bradshaw's three-star appraisal. HongKongCalling \"thought it was terrific\" while diabolomenthe \"loved it\" \u2013 but it's safe to say most of you agreed with our critic. Fainche wrote: \"Great review: the first half was great, a little klutzy, but the CGI of the train wreck was amazing. Not sure what happened in the second half but the momentum was lost, and it just got messy.\" zedhed concurred: \"Promising and fast-paced first half followed by schmaltzy and sentimental drawn-out second half.\" It fell to eroica to suggest a pleasingly convoluted analysis of where the project might have lost its way: \"The Spielberg films [Super 8] refers to are themselves homage to 1950s North American B-features. So it's an homage to an homage. An almost homeopathic distilled dilution of something not really great in the first place. Spielberg at least tapped into the nostalgia for that kind of storytelling, but are we now to have nostalgia for previous nostalgia? Cinema will eat itself.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
