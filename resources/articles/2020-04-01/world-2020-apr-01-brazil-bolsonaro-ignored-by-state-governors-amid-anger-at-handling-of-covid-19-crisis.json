Bolsonaro has repeatedly played down the dangers of Covid-19 and last week urged Brazilians to get back to work \u2013 in defiance of advice from the World Health Organization and his own health ministry. But his exhortations have been largely ignored by politicians and the general public. Just three of Brazil\u2019s 27 states, home to 5.7 million people, have relaxed social isolation measures as coronavirus cases continue to rise \u2013 Brazil has 5,717 confirmed cases and 201 deaths. A study showed almost 60% of Brazilians are staying at home. Jo\u00e3o Doria, the governor of Brazil\u2019s most populous and economically important state, S\u00e3o Paulo, has maintained a strict quarantine and this week openly defied Bolsonaro, telling its 44 million citizens: \u201cDo not follow the guidance of the president.\u201d Wilson Witzel, Rio de Janeiro state\u2019s rightwing governor, has also refused to back away from strict social isolation measures. \u201cSo far I\u2019ve been asking, now I am giving an order: don\u2019t leave your home,\u201d Witzel told his state\u2019s 17 million residents on Monday as he extended Rio\u2019s shut down for another fortnight. Witzel, a one-time Bolsonaro ally, went on to suggest the president\u2019s behaviour could land him a trial at the International Criminal Court in the Hague. Only the rightwing governors of the Amazon states of Rond\u00f4nia and Roraima, both Bolsonaro allies, have followed the president\u2019s lead by relaxing restrictions on shops and businesses. In Roraima\u2019s capital Boa Vista and Rond\u00f4nia\u2019s capital Porto Velho many \u2013 but not all - shops are open and there are people on the streets. In Mato Grosso shops have also partially re-opened. Ciro Gomes, a prominent leftwing politician from north-eastern Brazil, told the Guardian that in order to save thousands of lives, the country now needed \u2013 and was starting to witness \u2013 \u201can extensive campaign of civil disobedience initiated by governors, mayors, the overwhelming majority of religious leaders and the media\u201d. Gomes admitted the loss of many lives was now inevitable \u2013 but such a mutiny against Bolsonaro could help lessen the scale of the tragedy and represented \u201can act of protection for the Brazilian people\u201d. Bolsonaro has described coronavirus as a \u201clittle flu\u201d and claimed his athletic background would protect him from it. \u201cYou have to face it like a soldier on the battlefield,\u201d he told Rede TV on Monday. The previous day he told reporters: \u201cWe\u2019ll all die one day.\u201d The president has argued the damage caused by shutting down Brazil\u2019s economy will be worse than that caused by the virus, and has also suggested state governors were inflating the numbers of coronavirus victims to justify restrictive lockdown measures. But as well as facing a rebellion from regional chiefs, Bolsonaro now also appears increasingly isolated from his own cabinet. At a press conference with other ministers on Monday, Bolsonaro\u2019s health minister Luiz Mandetta called on people to follow state governments and maintain the \u201cthe maximum degree of social isolation\u201d \u2013 a day after the president mingled with people on the streets of Bras\u00edlia and said he was considering a decree to let them go back to work. On Tuesday the Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper reported that justice minister S\u00e9rgio Moro, finance minister Paulo Guedes, Mandetta and military officers in the government had formed a block opposing the president\u2019s stance. \u201cBolsonaro has put himself into self-isolation,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 \u00c1lvaro Mois\u00e9s, a professor of political science at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo.
