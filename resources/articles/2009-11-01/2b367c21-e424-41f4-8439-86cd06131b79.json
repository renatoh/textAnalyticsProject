This concert at Birmingham's Symphony Hall \u2013 given 50 years to the day since the Academy's very first performance at their alma mater \u2013 underlined how fruitful the relationship with principal guest conductor Perahia is proving. Perahia's great gift is clarity of intention, and here it ensured musicmaking of the highest order, notably in Bach's Concerto in D major BWV 1054. More familiar as the Violin Concerto in E \u2013 its original form \u2013 Perahia emphasised the work's natural rhythmic elan, and in bringing extra definition to Bach's frequently redistributed bass line, added subtle new perspectives. It is often the comparative restraint of Perahia's approach that permits the most illuminating interpretations, and in Mozart's Piano Concerto in G Major K453, the beautifully articulated but unassuming delivery was a case in point. The central Andante, in particular, was revealing. Its opening theme is curious for being five (rather than four) bars long and closing with a decorated cadence. Lingering lovingly on this, Perahia seemed to be labouring the point, yet, as the movement progressed, his logic became apparent, and this decorative detail pointed up a wonderful emotional depth. The Academy players were alert to Perahia's every nuance, with flautist Adam Walker and oboist Christopher Cowie outstanding. The insight of the two concertos was realised again in Mozart's Prague Symphony No 38 K504. Perahia's conducting of this was elegantly detailed, balancing intensity with an irrepressible energy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
