But JD Wetherspoon, the pubs chain, was among the biggest losers in the UK. Revolut\u2019s customers are likely to be younger and slightly more urban than account holders at the traditional big banks. But the data \u2013 taken from spending by the digital lender\u2019s 3 million customers from 1-31 March \u2013 gives a strong indication of the consumption patterns that have emerged since the pandemic gripped Britain. The surprise winner was Moonpig. Revolut said transactions at the online personalised cards company soared by 156% during the month. The retailer said it had been so busy since the virus struck that its orders were taking a week longer to deliver than normal. Games companies also had a big increase as people stayed at home. Transactions at the online firm Steam Games rose 116% in March, while PlayStation was up 105%. Britons were also watching more television (Netflix transactions were up 4%) and streaming more music (Spotify gained 9%). JD Wetherspoon, which had pledged to keep its 867 pubs open as long as possible, until they were shut by government measures, recorded the sharpest drop in transactions among Revolut\u2019s customers. They declined by 86% during the month. At Pret a Manger, transactions were down 82%; at Nando\u2019s they fell 78%. All the big high street store chains experienced a 70-80% decline. While media attention has focused on panic buying in supermarkets, the biggest percentage increase in sales during March was at local convenience stores. Revolut said Nisa, McColls and Costcutter \u201ceach saw an increase in the number of transactions larger than any of the UK\u2019s major supermarkets\u201d. At Nisa, sales values were up 52%, as people bought more locally, although the number of transactions were up only 15%, indicating that on each trip Revolut\u2019s consumers purchased more than usual. Transaction volumes at Argos and Amazon rose by 20% in March among Revolut\u2019s customers. But overall, total UK online spending was down 12% on the month, the lender said. \u201cWhile this isn\u2019t as drastic as the drop in physical transactions, it indicates that in general people are spending less online, perhaps due to an increase in delivery times for non-essential goods,\u201d Revolut said. \u201cConsumers may also be limiting their spending due to fear of furlough, redundancy or salary reductions.\u201d The figures also show a sharp decline in cash payments. Revolut said ATM withdrawals by its customers plunged by 83% last month."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
