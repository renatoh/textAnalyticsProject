Almost exactly 24 hours after Mark Lewis-Francis had celebrated the high point of his fledgling career by winning a silver medal at the European Indoor Championships in Vienna, he was arrested on his arrival home at Birmingham International Airport. West Midlands police said Lewis-Francis, 19, had been detained overnight and he will appear before Wolverhampton magistrates this morning to answer a series of motoring charges. He will also have to explain why he missed a court appointment last week. The Birmingham athlete arrived in Vienna last Wednesday to be told that he should have been in court that day and a warrant had been issued for his arrest. He said he had pleaded guilty by post to a charge of driving without a licence last summer and had heard nothing further from the police about the case. Frantic calls by UK Athletics officials to the police resulted in Lewis-Francis being allowed to stay at the championships and on Sunday he was second in the 60 metres behind Jason Gardener, his British team mate. UK Athletics had arranged to take Lewis-Francis to Wolverhampton police once they arrived back home around 5pm yesterday but to the surprise of team officials and fellow athletes Lewis-Francis was arrested before he had gone through the exit zone at the airport. \"We are not exactly sure why it happened this way,\" said Helen Wyeth, UK Athletics' communications manager. \"We had been assured by West Midlands police and the airport authorities that he would not be arrested at the airport. We had arranged for someone to go with Mark to Wolverhampton police station. \"He understood that was going to happen and we are not sure why it didn't.\" David Moorcroft, chief executive of UK Athletics, was at the airport and contacted the headquarters of the federation to inform them of what had happened. Lewis-Francis has been charged with a number of offences including failing to produce documents, driving without an MOT and driving through a red light. This is his first season competing in the senior ranks. As a junior he won the world and European 100m titles and after his race on Sunday he said: \"Alright, I drove with a provisional licence but I am not the first person to do it. And if I had known I had to be in court on Wednesday I would have come out here on Thursday instead.\" \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
