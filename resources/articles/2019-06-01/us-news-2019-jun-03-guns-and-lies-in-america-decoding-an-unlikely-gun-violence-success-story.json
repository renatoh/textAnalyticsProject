The series explores the connections between gun violence and poverty, health, work, housing, displacement, incarceration, social policy, laws and firearm access in an area transformed by inequality. It brings together the voices of Bay Area residents, public health researchers and criminal justice experts to investigate the dynamics behind the decline, as well as the people and programs helping to curb the violence. Driven by data and evidence, the series will challenge the misleading talking points and dangerous assumptions that have undermined efforts to address America\u2019s gun violence crisis.
