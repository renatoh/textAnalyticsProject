At a seminar hosted yesterday by the Walpole Committee - a club of about 50 UK businesses, all with an emphasis on nostalgia - it was argued that Britain should be promoting itself as the home of \"excellence and quality, prestige and exclusivity\". Meanwhile, corporate incarnations of the once proud state-run monopolies have been slowly shedding their national colours. British Gas, British Steel, British Aerospace, British Petroleum and British Telecom are all brands that have faded as the privatised industrial behemoths have demerged or repositioned themselves as global players. In the wake of such changes Walpole and its members have taken a lead in branding Britain's business identity abroad, often portraying the UK as a heritage park devoted to the nostalgia industry. Nostalgia trip Walpole chief executive Julia Carrick admits a certain image of Britain's past has been excessively fostered by some of her members, but insists this is changing. \"The balance between nostalgia and modernity is something that we are addressing with our members,\" she says. \"We are trying to persuade them to capture a happy medium and redress an imbalance towards nostalgia that has existed in the past.\" However, a list of Walpole's members -packed with traditionally orientated firms such as Aga Rayburn, Harpers &amp; Queen and the Savoy Group - paints a different picture. Conspicuous by their absence are Britain's hi-tech businesses such as ARM, Autonomy and Psion; and modern designers such as Paul Smith, Conran and Dyson. Roger Mitchell, deputy chairman of Holland &amp; Holland, a London gunsmith established in 1835, is candid about his firm's interest in Walpole. \"We became members because we saw an opportunity in certain promotional events,\" he says as the dapper delegates mingle during a coffee break. Walpole's last event was an award ceremony in New York at which the Duchess of York presented medals of excellence - embossed with the head of the 18th century prime minister and minister for commerce Sir Robert Walpole - to a number of its members. \"I think it is a brilliant idea,\" says Martin Skan, chairman of Chewton Glen Hotel and another Walpole member. \"I'm very proud of being British. But our promotion efforts are so feeble. Walpole is a way to beat the drum.\" Others are appalled that the image of British business is being left in the hands of such nostalgic interests. Charles Powell, chairman of advertising agency BMP DDB and former publicity adviser to the Labour party, says all UK-based firms should be involved in the process of promoting Britain. \"Wherever they are in the world, people will always want to know where a company is from,\" he says. \"So, any company that trades abroad is affected by Britain's image - and they ought to do something about it.\" One BMP research experiment asked businesses worldwide to categorise an anonymous fictional company, having only been told its was a pen manufacturer, either from Germany, America or Britain. The results showed that the fictional British firm was perceived as old fashioned, trustworthy and boring; its German rival was hardworking, trustworthy and innovative, while the US company was modern, innovative and creative. 'Dim memory' \"What people abroad don't pick up on is that a fifth of all post-war technological inventions were made in Britain. They see us as the Spice Girls and Shakespeare, with only a few having a dim memory that we used to be a quite innovative nation.\" Some image consultants argue that it is more than just the pressures of globalisation that have prompted many larger British corporations to abandon their national colours. Chris Ludlow, a director at consultancy firm Henrion, Ludlow &amp; Schmidt, says: \"BT may have dampened down their 'British' tag in order to be an international company, but its competitors, like Deutsche Telekom, manage perfectly well on a global stage - we know it is German, but we tend to think that might be quite a good thing technically. \"British brands, on the other hand, can look singularly parochial - a bit pricy, a bit fusty, a bit little less single-minded than a German organisation.\" Others have suggested the privatised industry heavyweights have been conducting a concerted purging of everything associated with their public sector past - including names and branding. Jonathan Griffin, who runs a new government taskforce charged with raising the profile of British businesses, says he is already resigned to many more firms airbrushing out their national roots as they revise their corporate images for the global marketplace. \"We have seen a lot already,\" he says. \"And we can fully expect that many more companies will want to mention their country of origin less and less over the coming few years.\" He points out that, where Britain was once dubbed the workshop of the world, for many multinationals this is now an historical aside with little relevance to present global emphases. \"Britain is not the place to be manufacturing mass market products any more - you only have to look at the history of the car industry to see that,\" Mr Griffin says. \"These days, you can manufacture in the Far East and import here. Your product may have a British brand on it, but it is still manufactured in the Far East. This is not the fault of Walpole and its members; it's just the nature of the British manufacturing base and the nature of the global markets.\" Charging a premium Perhaps surprisingly, a spokeswoman for British Airways - one of the few large international companies belonging to Walpole - argues that those firms branding themselves as British are able to charge customers a premium for \"flying the flag\". \"Our Britishness is recognised internationally and is core to our business - it adds that feeling of historical prestige, of authoritativeness and reassurance, which can be important in some overseas markets,\" she says. \"A lot of people are prepared to pay that little bit extra to travel on BA because it gives them that feeling of reassurance travelling home.\" Others have suggested that the \"buy British\" mentality - first promoted under Harold Wilson - is insulting to modern consumers who tend to purchase what they feel to be value for money. Complacency on this point can be costly, as the recent troubles at Marks and Spencer - that most British of retailers -starkly illustrate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
