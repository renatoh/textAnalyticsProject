After tech sites spotted the new option on the app, the streaming giant confirmed that it was trialling the feature which would mean downloaded films and shows could be watched at either a slower or faster pace on a smartphone. The move has caused anger from film-makers including Judd Apatow and Brad Bird. Trainwreck and Knocked Up director Apatow, who co-created the Netflix series Love, tweeted his concerns earlier on Monday. \u201cDon\u2019t make me have to call every director and show creator on Earth to fight you on this,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSave me the time. I will win but it will take a ton of time. Don\u2019t fuck with our timing. We give you nice things. Leave them as they were intended to be seen.\u201d Bird, whose films include The Incredibles and Mission: Impossible \u2013 Ghost Protocol, tweeted that it was \u201canother spectacularly bad idea\u201d as well as \u201canother cut to the already bleeding-out cinema experience\u201d. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse co-director Peter Ramsey also tweeted: \u201cDoes everything have to be designed for the laziest and most tasteless?\u201d Ant-Man director Peyton Reed wrote: \u201cThis is a terrible idea, and I and every director I know will fight against it.\u201d The Breaking Bad star Aaron Paul also shared his dismay over the news. \u201cThere is NO WAY Netflix will move forward with this,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThat would mean they are completely taking control of everyone else\u2019s art and destroying it. Netflix is far better than that. Am I right Netflix?\u201d The platform has previously received backlash over its option to skip the intro of certain titles. The new trial feature, captured above and currently only available on a small subset of Android devices, allows viewers the opportunity to play content from 0.5x, the regular speed, all the way to 1.5x. It is more widely used in podcasting, allowing listeners to consume episodes at a greater speed. \u201cWe\u2019re always experimenting with new ways to help members use Netflix,\u201d a Netflix spokesperson said. \u201cThis test makes it possible to vary the speed at which people watch shows on their mobiles. As with any test, it may not become a permanent feature on Netflix.\u201d The news arrives just weeks before their longest original film to date, Martin Scorsese\u2019s 210-minute crime drama The Irishman, which Vanity Fair now points out would now be consumed in under three hours. Netflix, which has recently increased its release of viewing data, counts more than 70% of a movie or episode as a watch."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
