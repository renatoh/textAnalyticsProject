Leading the challenge will be the men's four, including James Cracknell and Matthew Pinsent; the women's pair Katherine Grainger and Cath Bishop; and the women's quadruple scull, who are the only British boat to start as favourites. The surprising fact that two of the main hopes rest with women's crews was not lost on Simon Clegg, the general secretary of the British Olympic Association, who said yesterday: \"It's been interesting to watch how women's rowing has come to the fore in a sport traditionally dominated by men.\" A disappointing season has put pressure on the men's team and the men's four in particular. That much was made clear by Rick Dunn, who will stroke the British pair but was one of the men dropped from a silver medal four to make way for Cracknell and Pinsent. \"I really do want them to win,\" he said, \"because otherwise, what has it all been for? James and Matt will have made a sacrifice for nothing. They know they could have won gold in the pair and if they don't win in the four, they'll regret that.\" But Pinsent showed no signs of regret: \"You can still bank on a Pinsent gold.\" However the three-time Olympic champion did admit the four needed to find extra speed. \"Over the next 60 days, we'll set ourselves a daily target and if we take those 60 little steps, then we'll find ourselves three to four seconds quicker and that's going to be enough to win,\" he said. Pinsent added he expected the Athens final to be very close and when asked if he would celebrate victory with a swim, as he did after his fours win in Sydney, Pinsent wryly replied: \"No, this time I'll walk across the water to the medal podium.\" The women's pair, beaten into third place by Romania and Belarus in Lucerne, also know they will have to produce something special. Cath Bishop said: \" What I want is the race of my life; to go faster than any other women's pair has ever gone and I want to have that absolute intensity of performance from us, so we're flying over the water.\" The women's quad are one crew that have been flying. Debbie Flood, who sculls at No2, acknowledged: \"We're the World Cup winners and that leaves us as favourites for gold. But we still know that there's extra speed to come and that leaves us looking forward to Athens.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
