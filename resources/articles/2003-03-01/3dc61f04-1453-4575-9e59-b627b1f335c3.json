They breed rough collies. Instead Mrs Bibby lay in an Edinburgh hospital having attempted to take her own life after a police investigation began into the deaths of her seven babies. A trail of tragedy followed Bibby around Scotland and northern England from 1961 until 1974. Her children all died before reaching three years of age as Bibby moved from Edinburgh, through the West Lothian area where she now lives, the Borders and as far south as Preston. Yet, as her traumatic life unfolded, it seems the various police and health authorities remained unaware of the woman's medical records and the deaths of her children. Only now are officers probing Bibby's past in an attempt to discover exactly how the children died. Questions were first raised about the circumstances surrounding their deaths after comments Bibby is alleged to have made to a psychiatrist treating her at St John's hospital in Livingston, West Lothian, two years ago were relayed to police. A doctor is understood to have suggested that the woman may have been affected by the psychiatric illness Munchausen's syndrome by proxy, which can lead sufferers to harm children in a bid for attention. The condition hit the headlines a decade ago when Lincolnshire nurse Beverley Allitt - dubbed the 'Angel of Death' - was convicted of murdering four children and injuring nine others. Authorities in West Lothian did not pursue the Bibby case until fresh information came to light last month. Last Thursday, Peter Bibby discovered his 60-year-old wife, who suffers from multiple sclerosis and uses a wheelchair, lying on the bed of their Livingston home. She had overdosed as police were preparing to question her about the children. Just hours before Bibby insisted that she had not killed her children. Peter Bibby is his wife's third husband and did not father any of the children in question. He accompanied Roberta as she was rushed to the hospital where the allegations about her past first came to light. Late on Friday night she was moved to the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh but her life is not thought to be in danger. Official documentation reveals that Bibby had five children by her first husband, William Cunningham, in the Sixties. None of them lived beyond 27 months. Heart failure claimed the life of Mr Cunningham in 1967 and Bibby married John Delaney two years later. Her sixth child - and first with Delaney - was born in 1970 and survived just six months. John Delaney died in 1975. Last week the couple appeared shocked by the allegations. 'I am absolutely gobsmacked to be told the police might be investigating,' said Roberta Bibby. 'I lost my seven children but they all died of natural causes - you can check the death certificates to prove it,' she said. Her husband seemed equally taken aback. 'I don't know what to think,' he said. 'I knew she lost a couple of children to cot deaths. But that was before I met her.' Across Scotland and the North of England the question now being asked is how this record of child mortality went unnoticed by neighbouring authorities. A police source admitted yesterday that it was an astonishing revelation and said that while procedures were not as tight as they are now 30 years ago, Bibby's medical records should have followed her around the country."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
