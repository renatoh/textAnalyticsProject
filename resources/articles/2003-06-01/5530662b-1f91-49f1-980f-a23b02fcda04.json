Now that the future of David Beckham has been finalised, United's chief executive Peter Kenyon intends to switch his attentions to the equally convoluted saga of luring Ronaldinho from Parc des Princes and his prospects have been enhanced by a ruling yesterday from the Direction Nationale de Controle de Gestion, a body appointed by the French league to examine the finances of its clubs. Having already relegated Monaco, the league runners-up, to the Second Division because of their spiralling debts, the DNCG has now ruled that PSG's wage bill is perilously high for a club of their means. A transfer embargo has been imposed and unless they sell some of their players before the end of the month they face possible sanctions such as a points deduction. Just as Monaco have appealed against their demotion, PSG's major shareholder Canal Plus plans to launch a legal battle against the DNCG's findings. However, Kenyon is entitled to believe it will put United in a position of strength when it comes to the next round of negotiations and that PSG may have to sell players on the cheap. When Kenyon met PSG officials and Ronaldinho's advisers in Paris this month he was so convinced he had tied up the deal he was willing to interrupt Sir Alex Ferguson on his holidays to give him the news. Since then, however, Barcelona, Real Madrid, Valencia and an unnamed club have all expressed a firm interest in the 23-year-old and, sensing an auction, PSG have significantly increased their asking price to \u00a316m. Whether United are willing to match that remains in doubt, and there have been mixed signals from Ronaldinho's camp. Roberto Assis, the player's brother and agent, has informed Kenyon that Ronaldinho is impressed by the manner in which United have conducted the negotiations and the fact that they were the first club to make an official bid. Yet United are also aware that Ronaldinho might favour a move to Spain or Italy because he believes it would be easier for himself and his relatives to integrate into the culture. He lives with his extended family in Paris and they will move wherever he goes. United are now weighing up whether to try to hijack Arsenal's bid for Harry Kewell or concentrate on challenging Liverpool for the signature of Blackburn's Damien Duff. The Republic of Ireland international's advisers have spoken at length with officials from both Old Trafford and Anfield. The first arrival at Old Trafford, however, is likely to be David Bellion, whose contract at Sunderland expires on June 30. Sports stores are bracing themselves for a rush of fans wanting David Beckham Real Madrid shirts when they go on sale tomorrow. However, until the deal is finalised, probably early next month, Beckham's number will not be known."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
