It's pointless worrying about the future because what will be will be. You can't live in fear of things, you've just get to get on and face them.\" Although he hopes to affect Boro's future in a positive manner, he intends to do so in an unexpectedly laid-back manner. \"No, I don't think my players are tense,\" said Southgate, whose side host their fellow strugglers Portsmouth on Saturday afternoon. \"We can be as tense or miserable as we like but we've still got 12 weeks of the season to go so it's not going to make the challenge any easier or more enjoyable if we're like that,\" he said. \"We need to embrace the challenge and meet it head on but it's pointless the players being tense. \"We know we're not the only team with problems and we don't get down about them. Everyone's got issues. We are where we deserve to be after 28 games but, thankfully, it's a 38-game season.\" In a similar position many managers would be burning the midnight oil, poring over the fixture list, but Southgate dismisses this as a useless exercise. \"You can't waste your energy looking through other people's games trying to pinpoint where they'll lose points,\" he insisted. \"No one knows. You might need 37 points, you might need 42, it's impossible to predict. Looking at tables and fixtures is something I consciously avoid doing, what will happen will happen. You can use your time better. \"There's no hiding from the fact that Portsmouth is a desperately important match and we're desperate to win. There's no shielding us from that but it is one of ten games, ten opportunities, for us to pick up points.\" Although Steve Gibson, Boro's chairman, has offered Southgate consistently staunch support and remains highly unlikely to sack him, there is a school of thought which says that, should Boro fail to beat Portsmouth, it would be time for a change of manager. Considering that Southgate has worked against an \u00a385m club debt, cut the wage bill by \u00a37m last summer and tried to play attractive football, that seems harsh. Even so, Boro remain the Premier League's lowest scorers and critics believe that the players may respond better to a new voice for impending \"winnable fixtures\" away at Stoke and Bolton and at home to Hull and Fulham. \"You don't generally get a long time to build in football,\" acknowledged Southgate. \"But whether I'm still the manager or the chairman's still here, what matters is the long-term health of the club. \"It's hard because we're not where we'd like to be and keeping people's enthusiasm levels up is difficult. But these are the challenges that are presented to you in life. The easiest thing is to duck out but you've got to take them on. We don't get too down about the situation we're in but we're working damn hard to get out of it. We live and breathe this club every day, no one cares more about it than us. \"In fact the longer the season goes on, the more determined I am to get through this and the more resilient I feel. I have a very clear picture of what needs to be done and how to do it.\" Happily he has not lost his sense of humour along the way. \"I had an email from a guy saying that half the fans didn't want me to be here anymore,\" revealed Southgate. \"But I don't get bogged down by things like that. Anyway, if you've got half behind you that's not bad, it's more than the government's got.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
