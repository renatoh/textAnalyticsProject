Most immediately, there is the injury count. Ireland came off worse, with Johnny Sexton and Robbie Henshaw almost certainly out of the match against Australia on Saturday. CJ Stander and Rob Kearney are further doubts, while New Zealand will most likely be without Sam Cane and Ben Smith for the final date of their tour, against the French in Paris. Cane\u2019s ankle was twisted in a ruck; Sexton\u2019s hamstring (not the one he has had so much trouble with) gave out; Henshaw and Stander went off, the former on a stretcher, for head injury assessments and never returned. That was all by the 25-minute mark. Smith was later withdrawn with a broken finger that punctured the skin, and Kearney was another to have his head assessed. The All Blacks reasserted their superiority as the world\u2019s best rugby team, their skills unparalleled whenever the situation demands it. They scored three tries to nil, the nil just as impressive, considering the pressure the Irish brought to bear. But this was the game where rugby\u2019s inherent contradictions were exposed as never before, the profile of the match coinciding with a series of \u201caccidents\u201d, the like of which are inevitable for as long as a sport condones \u2013 encourages, even \u2013 the aggressive \u201chit\u201d to the upper body. Whatever happened to that quaint notion, the tackle? World Rugby issued its latest edicts recently, promising yet harsher sanctions for high tackles. In such a climate, the All Blacks were incredibly lucky to get away with just two yellow cards. Malakai Fekitoa\u2019s yellow could easily have been red, because he had so much time to line up Simon Zebo that his swinging arm to the head can hardly be described as accidental. Overexuberance, maybe. Cane\u2019s hit, which knocked out Henshaw, did look accidental but when you try to smash someone across the upper chest in a fast-moving sport like rugby you will on more than a few occasions smash the head. By the letter of these new directives, however ill thought through they may be, he had to see a card of some colour, but a penalty was all. Which is not to blame the All Blacks for a phenomenon that has been a blight on the sport for too long. World Rugby want to deal with the concussion crisis by increasing punishments for the outcomes without ever addressing the cause. Their directives are no more subtle than to try to win an argument by shouting louder. Last week, the notion was mooted that the threshold for a high tackle in age-group rugby be lowered to the waist. That is the kind of measure the senior game needs if World Rugby is serious about the campaign against concussion. For as long as high shots to the upper body are coached, practised and celebrated, there will be unavoidable head-high tackles. To celebrate the one and condemn the other with the ultimate sanctions is a hypocrisy no sport should countenance. That Jaco Peyper did not reach for the ultimate sanction many saw as weak refereeing, but it would have been a travesty for a game such as this to be compromised in such a way. Neither coach would be drawn on whether the referee had handled the occasion justly. Joe Schmidt talked about the assessment procedures the referee will be subjected to (by World Rugby), while Steve Hansen called for consistency, a sure sign he wanted to draw attention away from the approach of his boys. \u201cWithout seeing the game, I can\u2019t say whether all the penalties were right or wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cOne yellow card [for Aaron Smith] was for coming round and attacking the half-back [one of the less reprehensible of the various infringements]. I can\u2019t argue with it. But I saw the same thing happen to us and no one got penalised or yellow-carded. You just want consistency, and when we look at the tape we will see how consistent it was.\u201d Consistency in rugby is all but impossible, from player or referee. But administrators have a fighting chance of achieving it, or at least of avoiding directives that are so inappropriate the referees are reluctant to enforce them. This game deserved better than to be talked about for the wrong reasons. The game in general deserves better.
