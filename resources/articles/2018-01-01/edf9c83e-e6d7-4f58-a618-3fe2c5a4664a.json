Pedro was shown a yellow card for simulation, his second such offence this season. The tumble, just after the hour in Wednesday\u2019s third-round replay at Stamford Bridge, set the tone for everything that followed, with Willian booked for a dive early in extra time, despite the Norwich defender Timm Klose admitting he had clipped the Brazilian, and \u00c1lvaro Morata cautioned in the final minute after going to ground under Christoph Zimmermann\u2019s challenge. Chelsea have four bookings for diving this season, after two in each of the last two campaigns. Pedro and Morata, the former Real Madrid striker, were shown second yellow cards against Norwich, ruling them out of Saturday\u2019s trip to Brighton. \u201cI must be honest, I watched the three situations against Norwich and Willian\u2019s situation was very clear \u2013 it was a big mistake,\u201d Conte said. \u201cThen Morata, there is a foul. You can decide whether [it was enough] to concede a penalty or not, but there is contact, so not a dive. We must be honest and accept Pedro dived. I think the player \u2026 in this situation, the player is clever and intelligent enough to understand when you make a mistake. In this case, Pedro understood this mistake. He didn\u2019t ask for a penalty. \u201cThe player understood the mistake and wanted to stand up quickly and admit it was a mistake. But, sometimes we can make mistakes. The most important thing is to try to recognise the mistake and try to avoid repeating them next time.\u201d Michy Batshuayi, who will be permitted to leave Chelsea on loan this month if a replacement is recruited, will lead the line at the Amex Stadium in Morata\u2019s absence. Morata was shown a second yellow card for dissent as he protested against Scott\u2019s decision to penalise him for simulation as the game neared the end of extra time. \u201cHe has to overcome this because this is a stupid problem,\u201d Conte said. \u201cHe knows very well his mistake. You must learn to control yourself; he has to check himself in future.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
