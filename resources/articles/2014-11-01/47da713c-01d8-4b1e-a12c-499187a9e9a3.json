From bus parades to talk of a taxi for Rodgers in 195 days; his fortunes reflect the speed of Liverpool\u2019s disintegration with alarming precision. First things first, Rodgers\u2019 position as Liverpool manager is not in jeopardy or currently up for review by the club\u2019s owner, Fenway Sports Group, despite the team languishing in 12th in the Premier League and in danger of elimination from the Champions League after the most expensive transfer spree in the club\u2019s history. The word from Boston is FSG is firm in its support for Rodgers, the man who fitted its grand design for a rising young coach to polish inexpensive gems after sacking Kenny Dalglish in 2012, and that he remains the appointment for the long term. Nerve and common sense are holding. However, as Rodgers conceded after the 3-1 loss at Selhurst Park, 18 months\u2019 progress does not buy a manager immunity from a P45 should his team slip into sustained reverse. Four successive defeats for the first time since October 2009, during Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s final season in charge, as many league defeats as in the whole of last season and one anaemic display after another provide disturbing signposts. Fourteen points from 12 matches represents their worst start to a league campaign since taking 13 from 12 under Graeme Souness in 1992-93. Alarmingly for Rodgers, the performances are just as poor as a time Anfield would rather forget. The Liverpool manager had not even got back to Merseyside before reports linking J\u00fcrgen Klopp with his job appeared on Sunday. Both Rodgers and FSG have long championed Borussia Dortmund as the template for Liverpool to follow and the man from Carnlough is realistic enough to know only he can silence speculation over a successor. Equally, given its track record, FSG is unlikely to ignore Klopp\u2019s overtures about wanting to coach in England should Liverpool\u2019s decline continue \u2013 and this is a club that will be out of the Champions League on Wednesday should Rodgers\u2019 team fail to beat Ludogorets Razgrad in Sofia. Causes for Liverpool\u2019s dramatic fall since blitzing their way to the brink of the title last season have been well-documented. That does not diminish their significance. The sale of Luis Su\u00e1rez and Daniel Sturridge\u2019s persistent injury woes have deprived Rodgers of a strike force that scored 52 of Liverpool\u2019s 101 league goals last term. The near \u00a3120m spent on squad strengthening and filling the Su\u00e1rez void so far resembles another example of Liverpool investing unwisely from a position of strength. It defies belief that the club never signed a suitable replacement for the Uruguay international when they must have known he was leaving once he signed a contract containing a clear exit route last December. Sturridge\u2019s poor injury record has not suddenly appeared. As part of a transfer committee at Anfield, albeit the only member who confronts the wrath of supporters directly, Rodgers shares responsibility for the club\u2019s dreadful record on signings. Sturridge\u2019s absence until the new year is unfortunate but the manager is also culpable for being in a position where his tenure is openly debated on the Kop as well as in post-match press conferences. The citation for the LMA manager of the year award that Rodgers collected in May, the first Liverpool manager to be given the honour by the association, explains that it \u201cis voted by all LMA members, including every manager from the top four professional leagues in English football and goes to the manager, who, in their opinion and regardless of the status of his club, has made the greatest use of the resources available to him in the current season\u201d. Injury problems and eight new arrivals do not adequately explain Rodgers\u2019 use of resources since. Last season\u2019s flexibility has been replaced by intransigence in terms of team selection; persisting with Mario Balotelli as a lone striker, persisting with him at all before injury, restoring the struggling Dejan Lovren to the heart of defence despite Kolo Tour\u00e9\u2019s impressive showing at Real Madrid, and marginalising Lucas Leiva despite Steven Gerrard\u2019s trials in a defensive-midfield role. Gerrard\u2019s longevity is scrutinised after every defeat when a more pressing issue is why Liverpool have not acquired his long-term successor, or at least a player they can develop while utilising the captain more sparingly as the midfielder approaches his 35th birthday? The ageing process cannot have come as a surprise. Jamie Carragher\u2019s enraged analysis on Sky of the performance against Palace, when he accused a Liverpool team captained by his friend of lacking leadership, of being weak and easily bullied, will have stung Gerrard but was not a criticism of one player. The vice-captain Jordan Henderson\u2019s form has deteriorated in the absence of Su\u00e1rez, Philippe Coutinho is still searching for an end-product and the \u00a320m summer signing, Lazar Markovic, has not featured in the Premier League since September. The list could go on. Players that can still call on the services of Dr Steve Peters were evidently lacking confidence at Palace, according to the home captain, Mile Jedinak. The title collapse, Su\u00e1rez\u2019s departure, Sturridge\u2019s injuries and the elusive quest for leaders and defensive resilience under Rodgers has left Liverpool brittle. Restoring belief among his charges, supporters and possibly employer alike is only part of the task now confronting the reigning LMA manager of the year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
