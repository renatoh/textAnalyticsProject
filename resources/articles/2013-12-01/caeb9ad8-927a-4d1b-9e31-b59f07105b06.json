But an apparently sophisticated ring of credit card fraudsters are in possession of the financial data of a good chunk of the country. About 40m Target credit and debit cards that customers used between 27 November and 15 December are now compromised. Millions of people are dealing with the possibility that their personal information, including their names, credit and debit card numbers might have been stolen in a recently uncovered cyber breach. Target confirmed the breach in a statement released earlier today. The scale of the Target credit-card breaches is unprecedented, and it's likely that more than 10 million customers will find their credit cards abused, according to research that's shown that of consumers whose data was breached in 2012, one in four became victims of identity fraud. The Target situation, while enormous, is common. Incidents of identity fraud occur in the US every three seconds. According to Javelin Strategy and Research, identity theft affected 5.26% of US adults in 2012. That amounted to about 12.6 million victims with price tag of $20.9bn. This is not the first time Target has been in this predicament, having paid a $9.75m settlement in 2009 for a 2005 breach. Nor is it alone. Among recent companies to have admitted to customer data breaches are Citibank, JP Morgan Chase, Schnucks, a chain of supermarkets, and Global Payments, a card data processing company whose breach affected Visa and MasterCard card holders. Unlike this recent Target breach, which made headlines days after occurring, the 2005 breach took year and a half to detect. Similarly, JP Morgan Chase, whose UCard prepaid card network was hacked in July, didn't notify its card holders until the first week of December. While a recent survey by Federal Reserve found that 49% of consumers did not use mobile banking in 2012 due to security reasons, it's hard to imagine consumers abandoning the use of credit cards in droves. Consequently, federal organizations such as office of the comptroller of currency, the FBI and the Federal Reserve have all launched efforts to help banks strengthen their cyber defenses. If you are a Target shopper: In the meantime, while Target and law enforcement investigate the most current breach, here is what Target customers should do: 1. Check your statement. Did you shop at Target during that period? Check your statements carefully. Look for any purchases \u2013 large or small \u2013 that you haven't made. Go through your other statements as well; with your name and credit card number, thieves can gain access to other accounts easily or even open new loans in your name. 2. Call your credit card company and bank. Even if everything seems fine on your statement, you should still call your bank to alert them that your card may be vulnerable. While most banks tend to charge for fraud monitoring services, in circumstances where a security breach has occurred, they will monitor your account at no charge. If your identity was stolen, the bank will launch an investigation and return your money. 3. Stop the bleeding by calling one of the three major credit reporting agencies: TransUnion, Experian, or Equifax. It doesn't matter which one, as each is required to inform the other two of potential identity theft. By calling them, you will place an 90 day fraud alert on your report. This alert will make it harder for anyone to open new accounts using your information. If your account has actually been hacked, you should also consider freezing your credit report."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
