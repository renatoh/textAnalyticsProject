The actor\u2019s affection for Ginger and Snow has extended to taking them along to last year\u2019s Telluride film festival for the premiere of crime drama Destroyer. But Kidman\u2019s revelation in an interview with You magazine that she regularly takes hikes with the pets in a backpack has met with a more muted reception, with animal rights groups questioning the comfort of the cats while being so transported. \u201cI\u2019ve just got one of those carriers,\u201d said Kidman. \u201cHave you seen those? Those backpacks that you can put them in? A cat carrier that\u2019s a backpack and it has a window that they can peek out of and it\u2019s got air and everything and they love it.\u201d Kidman added that the luggage is \u201creally cute\u201d and that her cats \u201ccan\u2019t wait to get in\u201d them. However, Daniel Cummings, behaviour manager at Cats Protection, cautioned against such transportation for regular recreational use. \u201cWe don\u2019t advise people taking their cats out unless absolutely necessary as they are very territorial and crave freedom of movement,\u201d he said.\u201cPlacing them in small and confined spaces and taking them to unfamiliar environments will cause a lot of cats stress. When transporting a cat it should be for a minimal amount of time; the cat should comfortably be able to have all four paws firmly on the base of the cat carrier and have space to turn and to lie down. \u201cPutting them in a backpack with a window means they have little opportunity to hide, which is what they would want to do in situations where they are scared. It\u2019s unlikely that an experience like this will be beneficial for most cats.\u201d Cummings conceded that Kidman might well genuinely believe Ginger and Snow were happy with the experience, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s a very human perspective to think they would enjoy seeing the world like this, rather than considering the situation from a feline perspective.\u201d However, he added: \u201cCats would much prefer to explore outside, in their own territory, with control over their own movements.\u201d Meanwhile Elisa Allen, director at the UK wing of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, commented that \u201calthough most cats would prefer to lounge indoors than to go hiking, all cats are different, and it\u2019s possible some may enjoy the outdoor experience.\u201d She added: \u201cPETA encourages anyone who uses specially designed cat-carrying backpacks or any other animal-carrying accessory to be responsible and ensure that animals are carried gently and with care, aren\u2019t confined for long periods of time, and are never left unattended.\u201d Elsewhere in the interview, Kidman said she also owned alpacas, chickens and 10 fish, and that she has in the past eaten ants, describing the taste as \u201csort of off. Just acidic-y. Kind of weird. And I\u2019ll eat anything. I\u2019ve eaten almost anything. Witchetty grubs, worms and insects\u2026\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
