The nature in question is his own choleric temperament. But he also called it a \"freak\" act, when there was nothing remotely freakish about it. Sooner or later, a man so prone to uncontrollable rages is going to hurt somebody. It was Ferguson's bad luck that the unguided missile landed on the country's most photogenic features. David Beckham wore the wound like a fashion accessory. It brought to mind the magazine spread a couple of years back, when a stylist smeared him with fake blood. This time the decorous little X of surgical tape applied over the wound above his eyebrow merely emphasised the perfection of his features. In all the furore, nothing will have enraged Ferguson more than the smirk on Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's face - almost a laugh, actually - when the matter was brought up at the Arsenal manager's press conference on Monday. Here was further proof of what Wenger already knows: that he has Ferguson's number. Watching them compete against each other is like watching the last propeller plane in a dogfight with the first jet, and the rest of us can only feel privileged to witness such an historic, era-defining spectacle. Slowly but surely, the ingrained habits of English (and Scottish) football are giving way to an approach more in keeping with the way lives are lived in the new century. Just as corporal punishment disappeared from schools, so fear is no longer the weapon with which to persuade young footballers to give their best. Not that Ferguson's assault on Beckham could be compared with the clip around the ear administered by Brian Clough to a couple of misbehaving young fans, as someone tried to do yesterday - or even the punch on the nose with which Trevor Francis rewarded the inappropriate reaction of his own team's reserve goalkeeper when Crystal Palace went a goal down. Whatever you may think of it, Clough and Francis took precisely the action they deemed necessary. Ferguson's flying boot was the unintended consequence of a temper out of control - and who, in the adult world, can respect that? \"You can't give today's players a kick up the backside,\" Mark Lawrenson said on TV a year or two ago, and he was talking literally, not figuratively. For all Ferguson's remarkable record of success, the Premier League managers of the future will need to be far subtler in their manipulation of the talents and the egos at their disposal. But the Arsenal training ground will not have been the only place where Ferguson's reaction evoked gleeful smiles. Elsewhere there are plenty of people who bear scars - internal, and therefore less picturesque than Beckham's - as a consequence of Ferguson's verbal assaults over the years. It was said elsewhere yesterday that he can be a warm and interesting companion. True enough. But he can also be an instinctive bully, which might be thought to cancel out most virtues. And the catalogue of slights and feuds contained in his autobiography reveals a man capable of breathtaking levels of hypocrisy. We are all the richer for the presence in English football over the last 16 years of the Clyde shipyard worker's son who knelt before the Queen to accept a knighthood, the trade union activist who consorted with billionaire currency speculators. His contradictions are almost as numerous as his trophies, and his refusal to mellow or to go quietly into the good night of retirement endorses his own peculiar authenticity. Were I a United fan or shareholder, however, what would worry me is that he should have risked alienating Beckham at a time when the England captain is producing some of the best performances of his career. After a pallid start to the season, Beckham rediscovered all his imagination and his accuracy after Christmas. In some of his recent games (not including last Wednesday's international or the FA Cup disaster on Saturday), his touch has been more exquisite than ever, and his vision more acute. Not a time, one would have thought, to treat him like a feckless schoolboy. But Ferguson's willingness to use humiliation as a weapon is perhaps his least attractive characteristic. People who have been humiliated tend not to forget it. And it would be surprising if another who smiled a small, private smile was not a certain Swede, who may well profit from all this."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
