Ag\u00fcero was not charged by the Football Association for the 81st-minute incident and following the 2-1 victory David Luiz called for him to say sorry. Platt said he did not know whether he had done so. \"The opinion I have is there are a lot of bullets being flown at Sergio, and I think, like me as an employee of Manchester City, [he] needs someone to stand with him in the trenches and face those bullets. That is where I am. \"Sergio will do what Sergio thinks is right. I felt David Luiz spoke exceptionally well after the game, his words did not correlate to the headlines. I did not see him demanding any apology but there you go.\" Ag\u00fcero escaped a charge as Chris Foy, the referee, awarded Chelsea a free-kick and though this may have been for an offence moments before the lunge as he is deemed to have viewed the episode as a whole the FA's regulations state there can be no retrospective action. This has caused concern within the game due to the clear nature of Ag\u00fcero's offence. Yet Platt does not believe the FA regulations are wrong. \"I don't think we can analyse football matches on a Monday morning,\" he said. \"If you want to analyse matches on a Monday morning you have to analyse the whole 90 minutes of every single game. In any given weekend there would be several incidents where players would retrospectively be banned, be put in the stands, be castigated \u2013 we would have all the media around it as well. The officials that are out there have a very, very difficult job. The game is played at a pace that is quicker than it used to be. It is very difficult for people who have not played the game to understand what is a mistimed tackle and what is not a mistimed tackle. \"I don't know what the rules are or what the best rules are but what I do think is that we should not be analysing or re-refereeing games on a Monday morning. It undermines referees even more. And they have a difficult enough job as it is.\" City, who host Wigan Athletic on Wednesday evening in the league, also meet them in next month's Cup final. Platt believes Costel Pantilimon will retain his place for the showpiece ahead of Joe Hart, with the goalkeeper having been chosen throughout the Cup run. \"It is my opinion but not an opinion based on a conversation that we've had with him,\" said Platt. \"We don't finish a semi-final and then think to ourselves let's pick a team for the Cup final. What I believe is whatever discussion we may or may not have had prior to the semi-final, I don't see why that should change for the final. That will be my thinking. But I don't make those decisions.\" Given Pantilimon's impressive display against Chelsea and that Hart will return to the XI to face Wigan on Wednesday evening how can Roberto Mancini, the manager, keep him happy? \"He is a very calm, collected individual and if he decides he is not happy with that situation then he will knock on the manager's door and he will have a conversation,\" said the assistant manager. While David Silva may not be risked due to his recovery from a hamstring tear Micah Richards is back in contention for the first time since late October following a knee injury. \"Micah has been training with the team for 10 days, two weeks and he has played a couple of reserve games,\" said Platt. \"He is available for selection, whether he would get through 90 minutes I don't know but I would hazard a guess he will be involved in the squad. It is pleasing to have Micah back. We have practically got a clean bill of health \u2013 there is only David at the moment who is out.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
