The campaign, which is being funded by Geller\u2019s advocacy group, the American Freedom Defense Initiative (AMDI), features six posters including the one that features Foley. All the posters carry messages critical of Islam. One features a picture of Adolf Hitler. This is not the first time Geller\u2019s organisation has used posters on New York\u2019s Metropolitan Transit Authority\u2019s ad space to court controversy. In 2012, her organisation paid for posters to appear in ten New York subway stations. This time around the posters, which include some Geller used in 2012 and some new designs, will be only in two subway stations, but will also appear on a hundred MTA buses. They are scheduled to appear on 29 September. In 2012, after the MTA at first did not allow Geller to buy advertising space, a court ruled that the posters were \u201cpolitical\u201d in nature, and therefore covered by the First Amendment. \u201cWe review every viewpoint ad,\u201d said Kevin Ortiz, deputy director of external communications at the MTA \u201cbut a series of court rulings have made clear that our hands are largely tied.\u201d Mona Eltahawy, the Egyptian-American activist and writer, was charged with \u201ccriminal mischief\u201d after spray-painting over the posters. Four other people were also reportedly arrested for defacing the posters with stickers. Linda Sarsour, the executive director of the Arab-American Association of New York said that she fully respected Geller\u2019s right to exercise her free speech, but pointed to the fact that anti-Muslim hate crimes are up 143% since last year, according to figures released on Thursday by the NYPD\u2019s hate crimes task force. Sarsour was herself the target of a hate crime this September, after a man chased and threatened to behead her in New York. \u201cThe question here is what could be the consequences of these ads going up at a time like this,\u201d Sarsour said. \u201cWe have ignorant people walking around who are waiting to act on their hatred for Muslims. We don\u2019t need ads across New York City that try to link Islam and Isis.\u201d Since the controversy surrounding Geller\u2019s last poster campaign, the MTA has revised its standards regarding advertising. Now, any ad that contains a political viewpoint must display the words \u201cthis is a paid advertisement sponsored by [sponsor]. The display of this advertisement does not imply MTA\u2019s endorsement of any views expressed.\u201d Evan Bernstein, the regional director of the ADL in New York said: \u201cPamela Geller frequently crosses the line into racism when she criticizes Islam. In this particular case with the ads on New York City buses, it does not appear that she has done so.\u201d The MTA announced on Friday that a fifth poster, also submitted by Geller\u2019s organisation, was rejected by their safety and security director because they feared it had the potential to \u201cimminently incite or provoke violence,\u201d according to a statement. Under the new rules put in place after Geller\u2019s 2012 campaign, that is sufficient grounds for the MTA to refuse to run an ad. Adam Lisberg, the head spokesperson for the MTA, denied that any value judgments were involved. \u201cWe make these decisions in a content-neutral way,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cWe have narrowly drafted our advertising standards because of the First Amendment considerations involved. He said the MTA was not yet aware of a legal challenge from Geller."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
