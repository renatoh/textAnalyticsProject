The trial of a celebrity PR, Leon Anderson, and his nephew, Ashley Gordon, was halted because of Mahmood's involvement. He was to be the main witness against the pair, but the CPS said it could no longer rely on his evidence following the collapse of the Tulisa Contostavlos case. Mahmood alleged in a Sun on Sunday article in May last year - headlined \"Stars' Mr Fixit is drug dealer\" - that Anderson had sold him \u00a3300 worth of cocaine and MDMA. It was regarded as a \"dry run\" for his later sting on Contostavlos. Anderson and Gordon were later arrested and charged, the former with supplying drugs and the latter with possession of drugs. The case against them was halted at London's Southwark crown court in a hearing before Judge Alistair McCreath, who stayed the legal action case against Contostavlos. The prosecuting lawyer, Quinn Hawkins, told the judge: \"As my lord knows, having presided over the Contostavlos case, the position is that Mazher Mahmood gave evidence on two occasions in that case which tended to contradict itself.\" McCreath replied: \"Just a bit, yes.\" Hawkins said: \"The position is that the crown can no longer rely on Mr Mahmood as a witness of truth in this case, and for that reason, I offer no evidence against Mr Gordon on behalf of the crown.\" Anderson had commitments in France and was unable to appear. But the prosecution said the case against him would formally be dropped at a hearing on 3 October. It was McCreath, when dismissing the case against Contostavlos in July, who ruled that there were \"strong grounds\" to believe Mahmood had lied to him and had been \"manipulating the evidence\" (full statement here). Mahmood, known as the \"fake sheikh\", was suspended by the Sun following the collapse of the Contostavlos trial and is the subject of an exhaustive internal investigation. He could also face criminal charges for perjury. On 5 September, the CPS dropped a case against a doctor, Majeed Ridha, and a pharmacist, Murtaza Gulamhusein - who were accused by Mahmood in the Sunday Times of selling abortion pills - because it relied on Mahmood's evidence and there was \"no longer a realistic prospect of conviction\".
