The alterations to their style of play proved that there are avenues yet to be explored by a side who recently looked as if they had not merely gone down a cul-de-sac but accelerated into the wall. It was healthy to find that the national team need not always be trapped in the same cramped little plan. When he was blamed for being stuck in an outworn routine, Sven-Goran Eriksson might have retorted that the peevish criticism reflects the short attention span for a sport that is now advertised as a spectacle of chain-reaction explosiveness. Despite the virtuoso production of TV broadcasters, games will forever have their humdrum stretches. Contests customarily involve deadlock and calculation before some crucial deed is executed. Eriksson is not at fault for that, but he still had to show a desire to develop. Having fallen short at a World Cup and a European Championship, it was not fickleness alone that made observers growl when his decisions looked more like tactical laziness. Without casting out good players, it was essential for him to confirm that England can be renewed. Now there has been a serious review of the side's approach. Eriksson has managed in four countries but the Italian experience became so much a part of his character that he should be entitled to dual nationality. Playing on the break, though, has not served England quite so well lately and few rivals will be as gauche as Germany in that 5-1 revel in Munich. Eriksson realises it. \"From what I have seen of the qualification group,\" he said, \"we will always meet teams which defend very well and play on the counter-attack against us. If we don't keep the ball and impose our own game it's going to be difficult.\" Coming from a man faulted for dependence on the long pass, this was tantamount to a conversion. He was so in earnest that the cocky and slick Jermain Defoe was selected against Poland for his first start with England, scoring the opener. Looking at him and Michael Owen, the team knew that the high, vaguely aimed ball could be deleted from the repertoire. The new approach was interesting, even if we must not pretend England have hit upon some brilliant wheeze. They played well enough and deserved to win even if the decider was an own-goal, but a tame Poland side had lost their previous home match 5-1 to Denmark. Eriksson knows England could be undone by sides better at possession play. \"It's different when, for example, you meet Portugal, France or Brazil,\" he said. \"It's more difficult to keep the ball then, but who knows?\" Rightly, he does not rule out the possibility of turning again to more rumbustious forwards such as Alan Smith or even Emile Heskey. In the immediate future he will deal with the \"lovely problem\" of having Defoe, Owen and Wayne Rooney available with perhaps only two places to be filled. Although Eriksson will not be sending any stars into exile, the dependence on them was not great against Poland. The manager reported that David Beckham had been \"in pain for the whole game because of his rib injury\". Owen kept a low profile. This, however, left Defoe and others to shine. The partnership of Ashley Cole and Wayne Bridge offers another option. \"At a certain point you don't know who's left-back and who's left midfield,\" Eriksson purred. \"They know that if one goes forward the other will cover. They are thinking in the same way.\" All the same, Wednesday was no masterclass. There were flaws, not least when John Terry was drawn out of position for the equaliser and neither Ledley King nor the substitute Jamie Carragher plugged the gap. If every candidate were available, Eriksson might prefer Rio Ferdinand and Sol Campbell as his centre-backs against Wales next month. After two away games, Eriksson now has as many points as Austria. As a high reward, demands for his sacking will be stifled for at least a few weeks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
