That\u2019s the vision of Tim Rose, the managing director of Australian refining company Southern Oil, which last week announced the first stage of a $650m investment to produce enough diesel from \u201cadvanced biofuels\u201d to power Australia\u2019s entire defence force. A $16m pilot plant is to be built in Gladstone in central Queensland, sourcing feedstock such as sugar cane bagasse (what\u2019s left after the actual sugar is extracted) and prickly acacia (a noxious weed infesting vast swathes of land) to produce diesel fuels. If successful, and Rose sees no reason why it wouldn\u2019t be, the next stage will be a $150m investment in a new refining plant, and a dozen \u201cfeeder\u201d plants around the state sourcing feedstock from weeds, wood waste, old tyres, plastics and wood from demolition sites, waste from humans and animals and just about anything that would otherwise be destined for landfill. Rose says that by 2020, these refineries could produce around 200m litres of advanced biofuel diesel a year, about the same amount that is used by the Australian army, navy and air force each year. \u201cWe could have a big green military force \u2013 powered by domestically produced fuel,\u201d Rose says. \u201cWe won\u2019t have to import crude into refineries which are shutting everywhere in any case. This will do a hell of a lot for fuel security.\u201d Southern Oil says there is no official estimates of carbon dioxide savings from using advanced biofuels, but Rose says it will be \u201cway less than fossil fuels\u201d as the company will use waste products that typically would have rotted in landfills. So the greenhouse gas savings come from substituting biofuel for fossil fuels, which will not be burned. If you are thinking that these are the sweet dreams of a green ideologue, think again. Southern Oil has built a profitable but dirty business taking waste lubricating oil and putting it through a refinery to make it usable again \u2013 as lubricating oil. A few years ago, the company was approached by the defence attach\u00e9 to the Queensland state government, who wanted to know how the Royal Australian navy could meet its commitments to the US plan for its great green fleet.\u201d The great green fleet is a commitment by the US department of defence to source half its fuel needs from fossil fuel alternatives by 2020 \u2013 a sign that it take climate change and energy security seriously, and in equal measure. Australia\u2019s close ties to the US has meant it has also jumped on board. Green fuels have a particular interest for the Australian military beyond environmental concerns. They increase resilience and fuel security \u2013 and Australia is fast running out of refineries that can produce diesel fuel, and is increasingly reliant on imports. Hence the solution proposed by Southern Oil. Rose says there are three processing steps to make \u201cadvanced biofuels\u201d. The first is taking solid waste and turning it into crude oil. The second is taking that crude oil and turning it into distillate. The third is to finish the distillate to make a \u201cdrop-in\u201d fuel that can be used in vehicles, planes or ships. Southern Oil is already practised at the second, middle stage. The pilot plant will test the front and back ends. If successful, the company will spend $150m adding the \u201cback end\u201d to its main refinery, and then establish about a dozen \u201cfeeder plants\u201d around the state that can accept different feedstocks. Each will cost $30m to $40m. Rose says advanced biofuels are being produced in the US and other countries, although each refinery tends to specialise in one feedstock. So what Southern Oil is trying to do, with such diverse sources, is unique in the world. It is an approach they are obliged to take \u2013 for the size of the market, the distance between varying feedstock supplies, and the need to tackle huge environmental problems such as prickly acacia. \u201cWe can use algae, human waste, wood waste, weeds, sugar, anything that has an organic component to it and is recoverable,\u201d Rose says. \u201cAs long as it has a carbon and a hydrogen atom, we can liquefy it.\u201d What could go wrong? Essentially, the economics. Right now, the feedstock would be zero-cost or near to it, because suppliers have to actually pay money to dispose of them. If these suppliers got greedy, then that might cause an issue. \u201cThe defence people are cautious,\u201d Rose adds, noting they will want to take a few years to get the necessary approvals. \u201cWe just have to get enough fuels to throw into ships, tanks and planes to make sure that the stuff works.\u201d But Rose says it\u2019s a good time to be thinking of such projects. The collapse in the oil price, and the collapse of the refining business, means that there is a lot of near-new secondhand equipment out there. The Queensland government describes the pilot plant as an \u201cexciting step\u201d towards building a significant new industry and Australia\u2019s first commercial-scale advance biofuels production facility. Unlike other states, it has prepared a major biofuels roadmap. \u201cA fully-fledged biofuels industry has the potential to play a key role in our economic future, and this pilot plant is a giant step towards achieving that goal,\u201d Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said at the launch of the pilot plant. \u201cThis pilot plant is essentially the launch site for a Queensland biofuels industry. If we can develop this plant into a large-scale refinery, that\u2019ll mean jobs here in Gladstone, but it could also kick off a new wave of investment and job creation across Queensland.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false}}}
