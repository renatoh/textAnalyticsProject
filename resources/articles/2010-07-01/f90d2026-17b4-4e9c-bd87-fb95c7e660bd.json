Police issued an arrest warrant for Christopher Metsos, while the US government expressed regret at a court's decision to free him. Metsos, who is alleged to have funded an espionage network operating under deep cover in the US, vanished after unexpectedly being granted bail by a district court judge pending an extradition hearing 30 days later. Cypriot justice minister Loucas Louca admitted the decision to release Metsos \"may have been mistaken\" but said authorities were examining leads on his possible whereabouts. \"We have some information and we hope that we will arrest him soon,\" Louca said. Police said Metsos was wanted for \"disobeying a court order\", although they had no indications where he might be. \"From our inquiries it has not yet been established whether he has left the Republic of Cyprus,\" a police spokesman said. Officers searched airports, ports and marinas and examined surveillance video from crossing points on the island amid fears the suspect may have fled to the Turkish-run north, a territory that is not recognised by the international community. The US justice department said it was disappointed the suspect had been freed on bail. \"As we had feared, having been given unnecessarily the chance to flee, Christopher Metsos did so,\" said a spokesman. Yesterday, Frank Urbancic, the American ambassador to Cyprus, held an hour-long meeting with the president of Cyprus, Dimitris Christofias, but a government spokesman said the US had made no formal complaint. Metsos, who was travelling on a Canadian passport, was seized on an Interpol red notice after the FBI said he was wanted on suspicion of espionage and money laundering. Ten other suspected members of the spy network were arrested in the US on Sunday. Christos Philippos, a magistrate in Larnaca, granted the 55-year-old bail of \u20ac20,000 (\u00a316,000). Following his release, the alleged spy was not monitored by Greek Cypriot authorities, nor asked to do anything more than hand over his passport and report to police once a day. Ionas Nicolaou, an opposition MP who chairs a justice committee in parliament, said: \"I'm truly surprised that the court issued no such detention order against an individual who is alleged to be a spy. \"By virtue of the fact that he was suspected of being a spy, I don't think his conditional release was justified.\" Suspects wanted by third countries are usually held in custody in case they attempt to flee through the northern territory. The republic \u2013 the only part of Europe not to have extradition treaties with any country \u2013 is considered one of the easiest places to disappear in the west. The Cypriot daily Politis said the operation was marred by \"amateurish handling\" that had corroded Cyprus's image. \"You don't need particular police knowledge to suspect that if a man who is accused of espionage and is in danger of spending several decades in prison is set free, he will do whatever possible to evade arrest and extradition,\" the newspaper said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
