A poll conducted by YouGov for the party shows that 27% of the party\u2019s supporters at the last general election said they were less likely to support the party following the referendum campaign. Eleven per cent of voters said they were more likely to support the party since the campaign ended on Thursday. The figures will be seized upon by critics of Corbyn who have claimed that Labour is losing its core voters under his leadership. MPs calling for Corbyn to stand down have said that he is partly to blame for the failed remain campaign. At a fraught Parliamentary Labour party meeting on Monday, the head of Labour\u2019s remain campaign, Alan Johnson, told Corbyn that he had to take some responsibility, saying his team did not even turn up for the scheduled weekly meetings during the campaign. The YouGov survey interviewed 2013 British adults on 26 and 27 June. It asked: \u201cThinking particularly about the Labour party and the Labour campaign in the referendum, would you say that this made you more or less likely to vote Labour or has it made no difference?\u201d It found that 6% of those who voted Labour in 2015 said it was much more likely they would vote Labour; 5% said a little more likely to vote Labour, making a total of 11%. Fifteen per cent of Labour\u2019s voters said they were a little less likely to vote Labour since the referendum campaign; 12% said it made them a lot less likely to vote Labour, making a total of 27%. But the survey also appears to confirm previous claims by Corbyn and his supporters that 65% of Labour supporters voted to remain. It finds that only 24% voted to leave while 9% did not vote. A spokesman for Corbyn said the party does not comment on internal surveys."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
