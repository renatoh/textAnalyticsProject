I saw the reader interview and thought \"I could do that, it would be fun.\" I really like the readers' page, it's good to see other people's views. I usually read the Guardian when I have free time on weekends, like when I am eating my brekky. I started when I was about 12. Our teacher said it was a good idea, and my dad always buys the Guardian so that's how I got into it. I find it quite easy to read and there is always a really wide range of articles. I don't think it's weird to read a newspaper at my age, I read magazines too - Heat is my favourite. I also think I'd quite like to work in journalism when I'm older. Probably not in a newspaper - I think I'd prefer magazines. I really like the new design and size, and it always has loads of stuff to read. I read the main part first and I like the Review section at the weekend. I don't really read the Travel section. I'm not old enough to go to those places yet. I'm in my final year at school and have exams in two months. GCSEs - the big ones. I feel very pressured. My parents are hoping I will do well and I want to get good grades so I can go to college. Most of my friends are trying to find a college where no one else is going. I would like to have a fresh start and meet new people. I want to go to university but don't know what I want to study. I'll probably take a gap year and do some volunteering. I read about kids in the UK being unhappy, but I don't think we're that unhappy. The only thing that makes me unhappy is that I've got so much work to do. Bullies sometimes pick on clever people or people who work hard in school, but I think they are just jealous. I'd never let a bully pressure me into doing something I didn't want to."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
