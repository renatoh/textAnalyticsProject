Daniel's question prompted some degree of confusion among readers, so we better start off with a clarification. Obviously some countries, such as Australia, are islands in themselves, and therefore all the teams playing in their national league are based on an island. What we have looked for are teams based on islands that are separate from their national mainland, such as the pair mentioned by Daniel, and not those in an archipelago nation without an obvious mainland. And to those of you who doubt Portsmouth's status, here's Vicky from the Portsmouth Visitor Information Service: \"Technically Portsmouth is an island. It's joined to the mainland by roads but there is water that goes all the way round Portsmouth at high tide.\" But anyway, on to the actual answers. Greece's Alpha Katigoria was a popular suggestion from readers due to the large number of small islands off the mainland, which do indeed host three out of 16 top-flight clubs - OFI Crete and Ergotelis (both on Crete) and Keryka FC (Corfu). However, the joint winners were Italy's Serie A and Denmark's SAS Ligaen - each with four teams. Sicilian side Palermo currently sit atop the league and are joined in Italy's upper tier by fellow Sicilians Catania and Messina, as well as Sardinians Cagliari. However, whereas this quartet makes up a fifth of Italy's top division, in Denmark the same number constitutes a third of the Superliga. \"Denmark is made up of over 500 islands, of which more than 350 are inhabited,\" points out David Young. \"The two largest islands are Sj\u00e6lland (Zealand) and Fyn (Funen). FC K\u00f8benhavn, FC Nordsj\u00e6lland and Br\u00f8ndby are all based on Sj\u00e6lland, while OB (Odense BK) is based on Fyn.\" Know of a top division with more than four teams based off the mainland?

BROUGHT TO BOOK \"I was delighted to see that Ashley Cole's recent 'autobiography' has only sold between 3,000 and 5,000 copies,\" says Pete Nugent. \"How have other footballers books sold in comparison? A league table to show the figures would be fitting.\" Well, Pete, according to the latest sales figures released by The Bookseller (as of October 15), we can give you a mini-table of the summer's 'big' releases: 1) Gerrard by Steven Gerrard: 76,459 2) My Story So Far by Wayne Rooney: 36,973 3) Totally Frank by Frank Lampard: 26,662 4) Rio: My Story by Rio Ferdinand: 7,651 5) My Defence by Ashley Cole: 3,128. Kevin Mitchell's recent article on the subject is well worth a read and if you have any more figures for other footballers' tomes, you know where to email them. 'THINK I MIGHT WATCH THE AWAY LEG ON TV' \"What is the longest journey any teams have had to make to play each other in any European competition?\" enquires Robert Sleigh. We've previously dealt with the shortest-distance games to have been played, but another glance at the ever-helpful www.rsssf.com can solve this latest geographical query. By using this tool to calculate the distance between the respective cities (not to the actual club's exact location), it appears that the 1994 Cup Winners' Cup clashes between Keflav\u00edk of Iceland and Israel's Maccabi Tel-Aviv is the longest-distance competitive European game in history, weighing in at 5,269km. Eighty kilometres behind is the 2005 Champions League qualifier, involving Azerbaijani representatives Neftci Baku and Icelandic outfit FJ (Hafnarfj\u00f6rdur). As far as the Uefa Cup is concerned, the 1996 games between Maccabi, again, and Tenerife represents the farthest-reaching fixture, with the cities being separated by 4,874km. KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE \"With the speculation around Gary Speed and the Wales job, has a national team ever had a player-manager before?\" asked Dom Sturges in 2004. Indeed there have been, Richard. First up, we had an avalanche of nominations for Johnny Giles, pointing out that he managed the Republic of Ireland from 1973-80, during which time a regular name on his teamsheet was ... Leeds United legend Johnny Giles. \"He brought Ireland agonisingly close to qualifying for the 1978 World Cup, only to be cheated by a dodgy referee in Sofia, which ensured France qualified instead,\" says Carl Hall. As if all this wasn't enough, Giles was player-manager of West Brom from 1975-77 making him a player-manager of two sides and a very busy man. Giles wasn't the first manage to play for and manage the Republic though: Mick Meagan was Ireland manager from 1969-71 and celebrated his first game in charge by picking himself. Not to be outdone, Northern Ireland can boast two player-managers. Terry Neill was first up from 1971-75, while also managing Hull City, and his replacement Dave Clements fulfilled both roles during his tenure from 1975-76. Geoffery Luyuku writes in from Mombasa to tell us that former PSV winger Kalusha Bwalya was player-manager of Zambia, and also scored against Liberia while in charge. George Weah can top that though, he turned out for Liberia while managing the team and heading up the country's FA. Finally, John McBurnie takes us on a trip down the Fifa rankings, past Mauritania, Burundi and the Solomon Islands, to the Turks and Caicos Islands at No168. \"Scottish-born Paul Crosbie took up the post of manager of the Turks and Caicos team in August 2003. After falling foul of Wimbledon FC's demise, he'd seen the job advertised online. After two years in Turks and Caicos, he was eligible to turn out as player-coach against Haiti in a qualifier for the Germany 2006.\" Unfortunately, T&amp;C didn't make it to the World Cup.
