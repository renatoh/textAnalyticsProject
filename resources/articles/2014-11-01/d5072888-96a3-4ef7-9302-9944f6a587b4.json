The Catalan government said that more than , 2 million residents had voted, out of an eligible 5.4 million in 1,200 polling stations. The results are expected on Monday morning. \u201cDespite the enormous impediments, we have been able to get out the ballot boxes and vote,\u201d the Catalan leader, Artur Mas, said on Sunday, after months of tense legal wrangling between Madrid and Barcelona forced Catalan leaders to water down their plans for a formal referendum. The result was the symbolic vote, staffed by about 41,000 volunteers who registered voters on the spot in the absence of formal electoral rolls. After the country\u2019s constitutional court suspended all preparations and campaigning related to the vote last week for the second time, doubt loomed over whether it would take place. Until she stepped into her polling station on Sunday morning, Margarita Roca was not convinced that the referendum would actually happen. \u201cI was a bit worried,\u201d she said. Her apprehension was heightened after Spain\u2019s public prosecutor announced \u2013 hours before voting was to begin \u2013 an investigation into the use of public buildings to hold the non-binding, informal vote. The atmosphere on the streets of Barcelona was festive, as young and old made their way to polling stations across the city, some with Catalan flags wrapped around them and others snapping selfies as they cast their ballots. Outside the Jaume I primary school, tucked behind Barcelona\u2019s main railway station, voters arrived at 7.30am. The queue had grown to about 100 people by 9am, who applauded as the polling station was officially opened and they were ushered in. \u201cIt was really moving,\u201d said Enrique Sola Campillo, a volunteer, of the first few moments of the day. \u201cSo many have been waiting for this.\u201d Calling it a historic moment, another volunteer, Marta Masats, said: \u201cLots of us are remembering our parents, grandparents, relatives, friends, who were deeply democratic and today have passed on. They would have been very proud of us.\u201d The ballot asked voters two questions: whether Catalonia should be a state and, if so, if it should be an independent state. Chavi Gomez and M\u00f3nica Garc\u00eda were among the first to vote, their three-year-old son in tow. \u201cWe are here because we want him to have a better life,\u201d said Gomez. From the moment Catalan leaders announced their plans to hold a November referendum, Spain\u2019s prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, insisted that no vote would take place. On Saturday, played down its importance. \u201cCall it whatever you like, but it is not a referendum, not a consultation, nor anything that resembles it,\u201d he said, adding that it would have little effect. He urged the region to \u201creturn to sanity\u201d. Next to polling stations, volunteers collected signatures to send to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg to complain about Madrid\u2019s actions to deny the region a formal referendum on independence. \u201cThey\u2019re not letting us decide our own future,\u201d explained Jordi Crusi, as he added his name. Others hoped that a large turnout would prompt the central government to negotiate tax and political autonomy with the region or perhaps even pave the way for a proper referendum. \u201cEven if it\u2019s symbolic, at least we\u2019ll show we want to express our opinion and have some sort of result to push the process forward,\u201d said Felipe Alcalde Rodr\u00edguez after voting. \u201cThis is our attempt to be democratic in a state that doesn\u2019t respect democracy.\u201d For Jaume Marsany of the Catalan National Assembly, a grassroots, pro-independence group, it was an extraordinary day. But it was just one more step towards secession, and far from a decisive one. \u201cWe still have a long way to go,\u201d he said, noting that his group had called for early elections, which could act as a de facto poll on independence, to be held in the region within the next three months. Rafael Arenas of the Catalan Civil Society, a group opposed to the independence of Catalonia and who had called on Catalans to boycott the vote, cautioned against reading too much into the results. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a democratic process. Those carrying out the vote had a vested interest in the outcome,\u201d he said. He also took aim at the turnout, which he said was much lower than it would have been in any election. \u201cIt shows there are a lot of Catalans who are not interested in independence,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
