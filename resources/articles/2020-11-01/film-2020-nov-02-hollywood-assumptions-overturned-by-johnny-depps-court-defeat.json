The widely-held assumption across Hollywood had been that Depp would not have mounted the case were he not convinced of victory. Simply by instigating proceedings, the theory ran that Depp was boosting a stock that was in decline. \u201cHe had no choice but to defend himself,\u201d says Steven Gaydos, executive editor of Variety. \u201cHe was correct in his assessment of the potential damage that the phrase \u2018wife-beater\u2019 would have done to his future.\u201d What Depp does now that the phrase is legally deemed acceptable to describe the actor is unclear. Certainly any plan beyond just filing for libel will have been \u201cshaky\u201d, Gaydos thinks. \u201cDepp seems to have spent the past 10 years lurching about, teams of people chasing behind him,\u201d says Gaydos. Yet there had remained an expectation \u2013 even a hope \u2013 within both Depp\u2019s circle and the industry to which he has been so central that the high court proceeding would serve to remind the world of the cliches surrounding Depp\u2019s appeal: as an artistic bad boy prone to madcap excesses and lapses of self-control. Meanwhile, the more humbling images the trial brought to light \u2013 Depp collapsed over ice-cream, missing a bit of his finger, finding faeces in his bed \u2013 potentially lent a new, pitiable aspect. Says one veteran entertainment publicist: \u201cThirty years ago, he\u2019d have hated to be seen as a humiliated victim. Pushing 60, it sort of serves him.\u201d Brand expansion is not an exact science. Now 57, Depp is an increasingly rare commodity for an industry facing substantial challenges: a franchise movie star also reckoned to be a talented actor. Now too old for leading man roles, Depp\u2019s central role in the Pirates of the Caribbean has come to a close \u2013 and his involvement in the Fantastic Beasts series looks to be in increasing jeopardy. In late September, Warner Bros resumed production on the third instalment of the Harry Potter spin-off, after filming was halted in March due to the pandemic. Despite a substantial drop in US box office takings between the first two instalments, and some negative press surrounding creator JK Rowling as well as Depp, the studio is likely to proceed with the film. Rowling\u2019s work has helped bankroll Warner Bros for the past 20 years, and a switch to an alternative studio for future Harry Potter work would be disastrous. Depp\u2019s scenes in the film, whose release is still set for the end of next year, are not due to be filmed until the new year, and whether he remains part of the cast following Monday\u2019s ruling is likely to be primarily down to Rowling\u2019s discretion. Three years ago she defended him publicly, writing a statement in support of his continued role in the franchise despite the unfolding allegations. Rowling\u2019s agent, Neil Blair, attended the hearing alongside Depp\u2019s lawyers in what many interpreted as a show of solidarity. Shortly before the trial, in response to criticism of her public comments on transgender issues, Rowling published a statement in which she said she was a survivor of domestic and sexual violence in her first marriage; a claim her former husband denies. With blockbusters out of the picture, Depp will require credible choices to establish himself as a veteran player worthy of the Oscar that has so far eluded him. Small-scale vanity projects have largely failed to woo crowds or critics. For film historian David Thomson, Depp has not \u201cbeen attached to a worthwhile film in a decade\u201d. Yet film-makers remain eager to collaborate; he currently has 25 projects in pre-production. The stakes were therefore considerable not just for the man but for a beleaguered business that has spent decades investing in him. \u201cNobody talks about him as the CEO of a billion dollar corporation called Johnny Depp,\u201d says Gaydos. \u201cA corporation predicated on the charm and sexiness and talent and appeal of a person who becomes like a member of the family.\u201d When returns on Depp delivered, they did so in style: the five Pirates films made more than $4.5bn and the series was the first to spawn two instalments that both grossed over $1bn. Yet indulgence of Depp\u2019s flaws had hitherto seemed to expose the reality of a post-#MeToo landscape. Press reporting of the trial accorded as much finger-pointing to Heard as Depp. \u201cA lot of the coverage reminded me of an earlier time,\u201d says Gaydos. \u201cHeard was blamed for a lot of the abuse. There was so much scepticism around her story and this sense she brought it on herself as a strong-willed, attractive woman.\u201d That sentiment is echoed by Mariana Dahan, who runs World Identity Network, an NGO foundation championing the rights of undocumented migrants for which Heard has acted as an ambassador. \u201cPower flows downward,\u201d she said, \u201cwhich is why the outcome of the lawsuit Depp filed against her is so important \u2013 and will send a message to women around the world about the extent their voices matter. \u201cFor the vast majority of women, Amber is an ambassador on women\u2019s rights; standing with survivors as male-dominated cultural institutions discredit those who speak out against accused abusers.\u201d Her testimony \u2013 and the eventual verdict \u2013 reflect especially badly on the high-profile stars who failed to come out in support for Heard at the time, thinks Dahan. \u201cWomen should stand up for each other, especially other survivors of abuse. But there were no brownie points in endorsing someone like Amber, and I think people are now more cautious about how doing so could hurt their careers. \u201cWomen like Vanessa Paradis and Winona Ryder [Depp\u2019s exes, who said he had never been violent towards them] ought to have more compassion for what Amber went through. They lacked solidarity.\u201d The future prospects for Heard now seem far brighter than before the trial. \u201cShe never really got traction as a major, quality actress,\u201d says Gaydos. \u201cShe does not have a Jennifer Lawrence career; she doesn\u2019t even have a Kate Hudson career.\u201d Now 34, the actor currently has just one officially listed upcoming project \u2013 a thriller set in the underworld of European modelling \u2013 and her supporting role in DC franchise Aquaman has not yet been complemented by a meaty lead. But Dahan thinks Heard may use the victory to pivot more permanently into the world of advocacy. Heard frequently carried out her duties entirely at her own expense, once flying from Los Angeles to New York, then \u2013 as the city was gridlocked \u2013 walking miles through town on high heels to speak at an event. \u201cI was blown away by her commitment,\u201d says Dahan. \u201cMale counterparts have asked for $200,000 to speak at such things. I was like: \u2018My God, we are a charity!\u2019 But Amber did it for free.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
