Amid renewed reports about instances of hazing at orientation week at the University of Sydney, one first year student said media attention focused too closely on the excesses of the new academic term rather than cultures of bullying that continued throughout all terms. The student, who did not wish to be named, said: \u201cIt\u2019s quite concentrated this week and there\u2019s a heap of media attention, but it\u2019s the culture that needs to change, throughout the year. It is a misogynistic culture. \u201cHazing this year, everyone is on pretty high alert. Hazing might not be a pretty big deal this year, but the culture doesn\u2019t change overnight. \u201cI\u2019ve had a good experience, but I also know that is obviously just a coincidence because of the time I\u2019m coming in. Maybe it would have been different last year, or in years previously. \u201cI get the sense it\u2019s sort of like that Times Up movement where you\u2019re like: \u2018Is it changing? Or is it just a little blip?\u2019 I get the sense that everyone is talking about it, so it\u2019ll be interesting to see.\u201d She said her college had been proactive in changing its culture after the university launched a review into misogyny within the colleges led by former sex discrimination commissioner Elizabeth Broderick. \u201cBefore I started I knew about hazing. I knew that St John\u2019s did it and I definitely would not have gone to John\u2019s,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been here a few days and it\u2019s been good. I know that definitely post-Broderick, as they refer to it, hazing has been watered down. The Broderick report has been quite a prominent thing these past few days, and they mention it every day.\u201d Other students believed colleges had \u201cwatered down\u201d hazing rituals in recent years and that media reports had \u201cexaggerated\u201d the problem. One female student, at the co-educational Wesley College, said she had been convinced by the commitment shown by the college\u2019s head, Lisa Sutherland, against hazing. \u201cTo be completely honest, I was a little bit scared coming in,\u201d she said. \u201cI went to the interview with that in mind, thinking maybe there\u2019s going to be some hazing, but [Sutherland] put my mind at ease during the interview saying they have come down really strictly on that.\u201d She said she had attended the college for one night and felt \u201cproperly safe\u201d. \u201cThey literally say all the time, this is if you want to do it. This is happening, if you want to ... We\u2019ve only experienced one day, but they definitely had a big talk at the beginning about that.\u201d A male student at St Andrew\u2019s college said his experience had been \u201ccompletely good\u201d over the one night he had spent there. \u201cI know people and they said [hazing] hadn\u2019t happened \u2013 if it did ever happen \u2013 for like 25 years,\u201d he said. The student said his father had attended the same college and told him media reports had been exagerrated. \u201cI really don\u2019t think a lot of it happens. I think some of it did used to happen once ... the same reporters have been reporting on this shit for like 20 years. They did hit pieces on UNSW as well. They literally do hit pieces on everything.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
