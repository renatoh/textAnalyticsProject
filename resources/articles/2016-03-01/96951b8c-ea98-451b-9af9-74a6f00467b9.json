The manager sought to look ahead to Wednesday night\u2019s visit from Swansea City, when his team will attempt to close the gap on the leaders, Leicester City. But the shadow of the United loss loomed large, and it is one that has taken on a monstrous shape in light of the outpouring on social media from frustrated fans. Some of them are so cheesed off at the repetition of the same old failings that they want to start again without Wenger and some of his players, with the forward, Theo Walcott, being the current scapegoat. But Wenger, himself, has seen it all before, too, and he stressed the need, once again, for unity. \u201cWe have built this club, and it has been built before me, with values,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cWhat we try to do is respect these values and when we are disappointed, we need to show these values and clarity to fight together. Everybody has freedom of opinion and I enjoy very much that people care about my future. I thank them for that. Apart from that, in my life, I always taken care of myself and my future. \u201cWhat you want from your fans is to fight together until the last game of the season. The league is very tight, everybody can drop points, and the teams - and the fans - who can show togetherness and solidarity until the end, might come out of it in a positive way. That\u2019s what we want \u2013 not to give up when you have a bad game or a bad result.\u201d Wenger\u2019s reaction to the mutiny and fury mixed incredulity with resignation \u2013 although not the sort of resignation that his critics would like to see. After all these years, with the most recent ones being the most intense and prone to flare-ups, Wenger has developed the thickest of skins. \u201cYou wonder sometimes about the excessive reactions,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cDo people think football is only winning, and never losing any more games? It\u2019s part of football. What makes me angry is to lose the game. The reaction \u2013 I know now what to expect. \u201cWhen you always have the same, you don\u2019t give too much importance to that. My job is to give importance to what is important and I think, in general, intelligence is to give importance to what is important. I know that, by experience, your opinions change. \u201cWe live in a society where the excess is permanent but when the excess is permanent, it becomes ineffective. You become immune to it. In life, you have to focus on what can influence your life. People have opinions, but it\u2019s only opinions. They are like the weather forecast. Let\u2019s not go overboard. We do not play to be relegated. We are playing to fight for the title. That\u2019s why we have to put criticism in the right place.\u201d Wenger\u2019s hunt for perspective took him over some familiar ground. He asked which Premier League team had always been in the top-four during his 19-and-a-half year tenure (answers on a postcard, please) while he made the point, which has regularly come to feel lost, that \u201cfootball is a pleasure.\u201d Did he still feel that way about his job? \u201cOf course,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure. What\u2019s happening on the pitch is fantastic, in every single game. My job is a pleasure. Do you think I would do it if I didn\u2019t think that? I\u2019m masochistic, but not too much. For me, the job itself is as pleasurable as ever. I\u2019m maybe lucky as I don\u2019t go on Twitter!\u201d Wenger\u2019s team is always lambasted for a lack of leaders and mental fortitude when they lose but he continues to see it differently. \u201cIn a collective psyche, you always think you need a saviour when you have a bad result,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cWe have won big games this season, many big games, with exactly the same players. I don\u2019t feel that I lack leaders. Who are the leaders? The team. In every position. The players lead and we try to develop that with our work. Our job is to have a leader in every position.\u201d Wenger suggested that he might make a few changes against Swansea, and he name-checked Danny Welbeck, who has only just returned from a long-term knee injury, as one player from the starting line-up at United who he would have to assess. \u201cIt\u2019s possible I will make changes,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cSome players are still not out of it. I will have to see if I have to be cautious with Welbeck or not. Medically, I need advice on that and I will see.\u201d Wenger confirmed that Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain would be out for :six to eight weeks\u201d with the knee ligament injured that he suffered against Barcelona in the Champions League last Tuesday. \u201cThere will be no surgery,\u201d Wenger added. \u201cWe feared surgery at some stage before we saw the MRI. In the end, we got, on that front, positive news.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
