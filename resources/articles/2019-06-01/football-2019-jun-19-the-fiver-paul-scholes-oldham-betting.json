Paddy Power, eh? How heartwarming to learn that, for all their zany, b@nterific attention-seeking and in-no-way-tasteless dedication to jolly japes, this behemoth of the bookmaking industry was quick to flag up what they recognised as a potential breach of football betting regulations to the FA, as they are duty-bound to do. Moving with the speed they normally reserve for flagging up winning punters and dramatically reducing the amounts they are allowed to bet with their firm, the narks at Power Towers provided information which has led to the former Manchester United midfielder being fined \u00a38,000 and warned over his future conduct. His crime? Placing 140 bets worth \u00a326,159 on football matches during his time as a director of Salford City when such behaviour is not allowed. Unwittingly, by his own account, Scholes had fallen foul of a somewhat over-the-top FA rule that precludes all those working in the English football pyramid, from the Premier League down to the Isthmian League, from gambling on any match taking place anywhere on the planet. \u201cI accept [the] ruling,\u201d said Scholes, for whom, to borrow a phrase from the gambling adverts, the fun has stopped. \u201cI would like to apologise and I understand and fully accept the fine imposed by the FA. It was a genuine mistake and was not done with any deliberate intention to flout the rules. I wrongly believed that as long as there was no personal connection between me and any of the matches that I bet upon then there would be no issue.\u201d To be clear, there is no suggestion whatsoever that Scholes, who quit as a director of Salford to take a job as Oldham manager he has since left, was benefitting from inside information from any of his many contacts in the game and his contrition seems genuine. However, he has learned the hard way that he will no longer be allowed to place a bet on football if he resumes working in the English game. In a sport where temptation is everywhere, due in no small part to the FA having no problem whatsoever with multiple bookmakers hosing cash at the sport to encourage current and potential problem gamblers, we wish him well.

FIVER LETTERS \u201cWhen you said that \u2018good owners are as rare as unfunny tea-timely emails about football\u2019 (yesterday\u2019s Fiver), did you mean that one turns up late every day or (more likely) that they\u2019re nowhere to be seen come the weekend?\u201d \u2013 David Maddock. \u201cLoving the inappropriate Google search terminology (Fiver letters passim). Last year my mother [of course \u2013 Fiver Ed] was researching how to do her own patio, which requires hardcore to be laid down first. She typed \u2018hardcore spreading\u2019 into Google, and was somewhat taken aback by the results\u201d \u2013 Ben Letham. \u201cThank you Fiver for confirming that either: a) I have great predictive abilities; or b) you are very predictable. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s the latter. It was only on Sunday that I was stating confidently to my husband that very soon we would see a reference to Frank Lampard\u2019s Derby County\u2019s Frank Lampard (yesterday\u2019s Bits and Bobs), sending us into a spiral of confusion. I\u2019m really looking forward to Frank Lampard\u2019s Derby County\u2019s Frank Lampard\u2019s decision and whether any more apostrophes can be shoehorned into this\u201d \u2013 Katie Maddock. \u201cRe: yesterday\u2019s letters.
