Christian Eriksen, Danny Rose, Serge Aurier and Victor Wanyama were determined to force moves away and uncertainty stalked Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen who, like Eriksen, have entered the final year on their contracts. Yet when the European window closed all of them had stayed, with Pochettino bemoaning the difficulty throughout the summer of concluding outgoing business. The problem is the players are on big wages at a club that have just reached the Champions League final. Where are comparable clubs that want them and are ready to pay them more? Pochettino predicts fresh speculation will soon engulf his squad as attention turns towards January but, before Saturday\u2019s home game against Crystal Palace, he wants to make a fresh start. \u201cAlways it\u2019s difficult [to sell players] and then I think we are all agreed that Tottenham have more rumours than other clubs,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cIn one month I think the rumours will start again because the situation of the squad is going to help those rumours appear. Now it\u2019s a time to be positive.\u201d Pochettino, asked about Wanyama and Eriksen, said: \u201cVictor Wanyama is in my plans. Christian is in my plans. Before I understood that they were in a difficult situation and, of course, we tried to help them, to help the club, to do their business. When it\u2019s one player [who wants to leave], then OK. But when it\u2019s a few players, who start to make it difficult to create a good dynamic, a positive dynamic \u2026 Now we need to start to win games. Be refocused and who is not refocused is going to be out.\u201d Eriksen said last week he wished he could have decided his future himself \u2013 \u201clike you can do in [the computer game] Football Manager\u201d \u2013 which seemed to highlight a desire to be elsewhere. Pochettino, though, does not doubt the midfielder\u2019s commitment. \u201cWhen you sign the contract, like Christian who signed for five or six years, you need to be committed from day one to the last day,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cHe isn\u2019t not going to show the commitment because there\u2019s only one year left,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cThe difference is whether he wants to extend the contract or not. Different players have different goals. \u201cNo one is going to say: \u2018I want to leave the club\u2019 and, if no one wants you, then you say: \u2018No, I love the club.\u2019 You kill yourself then. The reality is that managers, players, coaching staff \u2013 sometimes they have one year left and they are happy; others need a different challenge.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
