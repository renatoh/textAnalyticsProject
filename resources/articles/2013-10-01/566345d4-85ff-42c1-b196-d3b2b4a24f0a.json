The 29-year-old wing, who has played for the England Saxons and Sevens teams, fits with the declared intention of the club's chairman, Adam Pearson, and newly promoted coach, Lee Radford, to emphasise homegrown talent in the squad, following the successful models of Wigan and Leeds. Biggs, who is from Beverley, attended Hymers College in Hull, and has supported the black and whites all his life, said: \"I think it is a big challenge in a sport that I've never played before, but it's one that I'm really excited about.\" Radford, who has taken over from Peter Gentle after the Australian was sacked following an emphatic play-off defeat at Huddersfield, said: \"Tom looked very comfortable and competent playing in rugby union, but it was his enthusiasm about the prospect of leaving that to join Hull FC and the challenge in store that excited me. \"He could quite easily remain set on his current deal in union, but he was keen to have the opportunity to test himself in rugby league and play for us. \"He is a local lad and an FC supporter, which you can see means a lot to him, and we're hoping we can nurture that enthusiasm to help him make a positive transition into our sport, which I am sure he will excel in.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
