Ask the large and popular magazine to join the 21st century and pay you by direct bank transfer. David Fermer, Seaford Baffled by Seth I've just read Seth Finkelstein's article - twice (Read me first, October 25). I still don't understand it. Am I alone? Gerry McSweeney, Taunton Studying playtime Aleks Krotoski didn't make the obvious point that a lot of academic research is not ecologically valid (Boffins and industry: will the twain ever meet? October 25). Experimental research takes place in laboratories that bear no relationship with playing in the real world. First, playing games in a lab is not very comfortable. Second, games have a social context, often played with friends or online with other people. Third, games are played at different times. Fourth, games are usually played over several sessions and require time in which to become engaged or absorbed. Finally, players have preferences for certain types of games. A lot of research fails to control for these factors. Professor Mark Griffiths, Nottingham Trent University What's my line? Chris Smith complains about getting only 1.2Mbps from a line advertised as up to 8Mbps (Letters, October 25). Sorry, Chris, but you've got nothing to complain about. In offering performance up to 8Mbps, BT is saying that the speed will not exceed 8Mbps. So, as BT sees it, what's the problem? BT is delivering to you what it said that it would. Neil Muir, Shrewsbury \u00b7 I'd imagine the issue is a physical problem with your phone socket. Consider trying another phone socket and changing the microfilters, and if that does nothing, talk to your ISP which should be able to run tests on the line and, if required, send out a BT engineer. When I first switched to ADSL my \"2Mbps\" line was barely reaching 100kbps, so a BT engineer replaced my ageing master socket and I promptly connected at 2Mbps exactly. Ross Burton, Bishops Stortford \u00b7 I'm as baffled as Chris Smith about BT's ability to get away with its \"up to 8Mbps\" claims. Does any other business routinely deliver around 10% to 15% of what it promises - and charges for? Alan Paterson, London Growling for Leopard I was surprised - no, startled - to see no mention of the impeding release of Apple's Mac OS X \"Leopard\" in today's Technology Guardian (October 25). Are you unaware that the OS has just been released worldwide? The OS that Walt Mossberg has just praised as being \"better and faster than Vista\"? The red carpet was certainly laid out for Microsoft's Vista in January: why should things be different for a company that surpassed giants such as IBM and Intel in many areas with its most recent financial results? Phelim Brady, Guildford Manual labour I used to be a technical author in computing and electronics, and so did many of my friends, but the job has become extinct (Letters and blogs, October 25). The internet set the seal on this by allowing companies to sell software and hardware with only a brochure with a URL for a website and a helpdesk phone number. Microsoft delivered the death blow by hiring tech authors who wrote carefully crafted manuals and in-program help that told the user nothing useful, thus creating a market for MS-certified training courses. Consumers are now conditioned to have low expectations about documentation, so they get what they expect. All the old-time tech authors are now dead, retired or running boarding houses in Bognor Regis.
