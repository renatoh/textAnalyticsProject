Young UK quintet WorldService Project have no problem with that. Pianist/leader Dave Morecroft has described their genre-mashing brashness as \"a cage-fight between Weather Report, Stravinsky, Meshuggah, Zappa and Monty Python,\" and he might have added the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band to that list. This mix, and WSP's ambitious pan-European Match &amp; Fuse collaborations, have brought them plenty of new fans. This set's title track and the boiling De-Frienders are full of farmyard honkings, free-jazz melees, glimpsed bebop, and thrash chords, while Barmy Army mixes march-time and trad-jazz with flatulent free-trombone eruptions, and Change the Fucking Record is stompingly raw and punky - all elements that make WSG a riotously entertaining live band. But it's the utterly contrasting 10-minute finale, Cunha - a slow coalescence of electronic murmurs, long-note horn sounds and dark ensemble accumulations that represents WSP's highly creative straight face."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
