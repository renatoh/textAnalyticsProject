The 10-year investment plan for upgrades and refurbishments comes ahead of the prime minister\u2019s key speech on Tuesday in the Midlands, where he will set out how he thinks major infrastructure projects \u2013 including hospital and house building \u2013 will form part of his plan for the country\u2019s economic revival. Downing Street is yet to set out where the money will come from, and whether it forms part of an anticipated large-scale borrowing programme. This would be the first major schools rebuilding programme since 2014. It comes a decade after Labour\u2019s flagship Building Schools for the Future scheme was scrapped by the Conservatives in 2010, an initial casualty of austerity that halted 715 rebuild projects. This week is a pivotal one for Johnson\u2019s premiership, as he uses his address to restate his election-winning promise of \u201clevelling up\u201d the country. He will attempt to strike an upbeat tone after weeks of criticism over his government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus. Many of the new school upgrades will be in northern England and the Midlands, where Johnson won an unprecedented number of seats in former Labour heartlands, securing his 80-seat majority. Johnson said: \u201cAs we bounce back from the pandemic, it\u2019s important we lay the foundations for a country where everyone has the opportunity to succeed, with our younger generations front and centre of this mission. \u201cThis major new investment will make sure our schools and colleges are fit for the future, with better facilities and brand new buildings so that every child gets a world-class education.\u201d Schools are not due to reopen fully until September for all age groups and there has been significant concern among parents, teachers and charities about the lack of educational provision during lockdown and the impact this will have on disadvantaged children. Earlier this month, the education secretary announced a \u00a31bn Covid catch-up plan to tackle the impact of lost teaching time. This included new measures to help primary and secondary pupils catch up, including \u00a3650m for state schools to lift educational outcomes and a \u00a3350m tutoring scheme specifically for the most disadvantaged pupils. The rebuilding programme will see the first 50 projects announced later this year and construction work start in September 2021. They are expected to mainly focus on secondary schools, which is where the growth in pupil numbers is going to be over the next five years. Money for the rest of the nine years of the scheme will be set out at the next government spending review, which is expected this autumn. Johnson has also announced \u00a3560m more for school repairs and upgrades, in addition to \u00a31.4bn in school condition funding already committed in 2020-21. The majority of school buildings in England are more than 40 years old, with 60% of them built before 1976. In a 2017 report, the National Audit Office said that \u201cdeterioration in the condition of the school estate is a significant risk to long-term value for money\u201d. The NAO estimated that England\u2019s schools needed \u00a36.7bn to meet the backlog of repairs and rebuilding needed to bring them up to satisfactory or better condition, and a further \u00a37.1bn to bring all school buildings from satisfactory to good condition. The NAO found that the most common major defects are problems with electrics and external walls. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, representing headteachers, said: \u201cIt is desperately needed, long overdue, and will require further investment over and above that outlined in this announcement, but it is a significant step in the right direction. \u201cThree years ago, the National Audit Office reported that it would cost an estimated \u00a36.7bn to return all school buildings to satisfactory or better condition. The situation is likely to have worsened since then, leaving far too many children studying in buildings that are not fit for purpose.\u201d Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: \u201cWhile we await the precise detail that will follow in the next spending review, one thing is for sure: education must never be allowed to fall into such a perilous state again.\u201d The 10-year project promised by Johnson looks likely to replace the government\u2019s existing Priority School Building Programme, which runs out next year. That programme spent around \u00a34.4bn on 537 repair and rebuild projects, some of which were privately financed, since 2011."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
