Having taken the lead with their only shot on target, they promptly lost it again because \u2026 well, they\u2019re Arsenal. More important than any result, however, with none of his four remaining captains in his starting lineup, the beleaguered Unai Emery was forced to pick Rob Holding to wear The Armband and will have been mightily relieved the central defender didn\u2019t let him down like others he could mention. Not only did Holding lead his teammates out without tripping over his own feet, he also won the pre-match coin toss in a triumph that suggests the 24-year-old is to the captaincy born. There\u2019s plenty more Euro Vase action to completely ignore tonight, what with Wolves, Manchester United, the Queen\u2019s Celtic and the Pope\u2019s O\u2019Rangers all in action. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r will be without nine players, three of whom might even have got a game. \u201cWe should have had a few more results than we have got but we need to keep working and we know we are on the right track,\u201d said the man who could scarcely sound less convincing if he was standing outside 10 Downing Street and clutching both sides of a lectern to prevent himself from being blown backwards by the torrent of unconvincing nonsense spewing forth from his pie-hole. Still enjoying the novelty of their first European adventure in aeons, Wolves entertain Slovan Bratislava at Molineux, in a repeat of the fixture that saw them beat the Slovak side 2-1 in a behind-closed-doors fixture attended by \u2026 em, over 20,000 people in Slovakia a fortnight ago. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while not playing in front of our fans,\u201d said Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo. \u201cWe\u2019ve missed them. We want them close to us!\u201d But not too close, as fan incursions on the pitch are a breach of Uefa regulations. Despite it being November, Scottish fitba remains surprisingly well-represented in European competition, with both the Pope\u2019s O\u2019Rangers and the Queen\u2019s Celtic still flying the flag as the year enters its last knockings. O\u2019Rangers host Porto at Ibrox, knowing a win would put them in the box-seat to qualify for the last 356 and their manager has been fishing for compliments accordingly. \u201cIf you look at our record in Europe I think we deserve some praise,\u201d $tevie Mbe said, clearly still dining out on the narrow 2-1 reverse visited upon his side by the mighty Young Boys in October. Their friends and neighbours the Queen\u2019s Celtic will be in Rome taking on Lazio. While no end of Celtic fans have an unsurprising spiritual affinity with the Italian capital the head of the Catholic church calls home, the welcome some have received from a minority of locals has been less than warm. \u201cCeltic can confirm that two fans have been injured after being stabbed last night,\u201d said a Celtic statement. The Fiver is pleased to report both victims escaped serious harm.

QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cI texted him and he texted me back. I still feel really, really bad about this. I feel really sorry. I\u2019m so sad this happened and that I was involved. It\u2019s been a really, really tough few days\u201d \u2013 Son Heung-min shows that decency still exists in football as he reveals he contacted Andr\u00e9 Gomes after his role in the Everton midfielder\u2019s horrific ankle injury. RECOMMENDED LISTENING FOOTBALL WEEKLY EXTRA! FOOTBALL WEEKLY EXTRAAA! FOOTBALL WEEKLY EXTRAAAAAA! FIVER LETTERS \u201cWith regards to Johnny McIntyre\u2019s baseless accusation that I am some kind of Noble Francis sleeper agent (yesterday\u2019s letters), I can confirm this isn\u2019t the case \u2013 nor are my emails prepared by some deep fake Russian bot looking to influence the appointment of future Guardian sports journalists in order to secure favourable coverage\u201d \u2013 Oliver Billenness. \u201cIf Wenger gets the Bayern job, this can only be part of some undercover Arsenal plan to finally see somebody else claim the naming rights to the Big Cup round of Arsenal\u201d \u2013 Lars Gaertner. \u201cIn today\u2019s Rumour Mill on the big website, Barry Glendenning makes a witty reference to the door marked \u2018Ausfahrt\u2019 at the Allianz Stadium in good old M\u00fcnchen. May I remind him that doors in Germany are more likely to be marked \u2018Ausgang\u2019 unless it\u2019s the underground car park\u201d \u2013 Philip Larmett (and 1,056 others). \u201cAI really seems to be taking off with varying results.

Ars\u00e8ne Wenger admits he is \u201cundecided\u201d over all this blather about whether he may be Bayern Munich-bound. \u201cI never refuse to talk to Bayern because I know these people,\u201d he said, the tease. Ederson could be out of Sunday\u2019s game against Liverpool after the Manchester City goalkeeper suffered muscle-gah against Atalanta. Meanwhile Sadio Man\u00e9 says he won\u2019t change the way he plays after being accused of diving by Pep Guardiola. \u201cI think it\u2019s a bit clever from him to get the attention of the referee,\u201d he roared. And Stoke have made an approach for the Norn Iron manager Michael O\u2019Neill, and are prepared to offer him serious wedge. STILL WANT MORE?
