As chairman I was taken a little bit aback,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was some strong resistance on the call from Pacific Island leaders for more concrete works to reduce greenhouse gases, but to particularly cut down and stop new coalmines in Australia,\u201d said Sopoaga. Throughout the forum Scott Morrison repeatedly spoke of the evident impact of climate change on Tuvalu, but said Australia was a good international partner on climate change and was on track to reduce its emissions in line with Paris targets. The ABC filmed the episode at the University of South Pacific in Fiji\u2019s capital of Suva earlier on Monday, the first time Q&amp;A has been filmed in the Pacific, and one of the few times the program has been filmed outside Australia. The episode was dominated by the climate emergency, as Pacific leaders spoke of the impact on their nations and challenged Australia on its response. In response to a question about the impact of the climate crisis on low-lying islands like his own nation of Tuvalu, Sopoaga said: \u201cIf the world doesn\u2019t reduce emissions as called for by the IPCC special report \u2026 we will face the situation where island countries like Tuvalu, Kiribati, Marshall Islands and others will be submerged into the sea by 2060, this is a scary scenario and it is very, very serious. \u201cI certainly hope that not only the Pacific, but those that have polluted the atmosphere and caused global warming will come to react and do the right thing in response to the special report.\u201d Virisila Buadromo, an advocate for women\u2019s and human rights in Fiji, urged Australia to take more action. \u201cI think Australia, as the largest country in the region, the richest country in the region, as well as, you also happen to be the largest emitter of carbon in the region, I think that it\u2019s important that if you are part of our family, you need to stand with our family \u2026 to fight against climate change.\u201d Alex Hawke, the minister for international development and the Pacific, defended Australia\u2019s record in this area. \u201cAustralia does do a lot on climate change internationally and here in the Pacific as well and we take it very seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to meet our targets in Paris, we\u2019ve met our targets in Kyoto, we\u2019re going to reduce emissions by 26-28% by 2030 on our 2005 levels, this year we\u2019ll have about 20% of our power generated by renewables and we hope that to be a third by 2020.\u201d While the Fijian attorney general, Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, was more diplomatic towards Australia, saying that Fiji recognised countries had their own political and economic imperatives, he added: \u201cWe need first of all everyone to recognise that actually coalmining is detrimental to the environment, creates climate events and then we need to have a game plan, the game plan is to have a carbon-neutral economy by 2050.\u201d The conversation also touched on illegal fishing; the increased rates of hard drug use and addiction in the Pacific, which is used as a transit point for drugs trafficked to Australia; the influence of China in the region; and the outbreak of measles, which has particularly devastated Samoa, killing 53 people. On China, Alex Hawke said Australia was happy to work with any international partners in the region who had the Pacific\u2019s best interest at heart, and that Australia wasn\u2019t threatened by China\u2019s presence as long as China was focusing on things like health and education and the region\u2019s economic prosperity. \u201cWe don\u2019t look at the region through a geo-strategic lens,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the Pacific\u2019s time, there\u2019s certainly a lot of interest in the Pacific and we do have to take account, as a united people in this region, of how to use this time to do better for people in the Pacific, but that doesn\u2019t mean compromising values and sovereignty and I think that\u2019s sometimes where there\u2019s a difference in behaviour. I think people in the Pacific are very savvy people about working out who is coming into the region with their agenda in mind, their priorities in mind versus what\u2019s good for the Pacific countries.\u201d The panel was also asked by an audience member about violence against women. The Pacific has the highest rates of violence against women in the world. Tony Jones threw the question to Buadromo, who quipped: \u201cBecause I\u2019m the feminist and I work in women\u2019s rights the assumption is I\u2019m the one who should be combatting violence against women?\u201d She later took Fiji\u2019s attorney general to task, interrupting him as he outlined his government\u2019s record on domestic violence, saying while legislation now existed to punish perpetrators, that did not stop violence before it happened. \u201cThere is a psyche that is perpetuated by your government, your prime minister has perpetuated this psyche where violence is OK, because as we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of weeks, in the last year there have been repeated incidents of people being beaten up by security forces,\u201d she said. Jones ended the program with a joke at Hawke\u2019s expense, as the minister thanked the ABC for hosting the program in Fiji and said he hoped to see much more of the ABC in the region, with Jones saying: \u201cGive us the funds and we\u2019ll be back.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
