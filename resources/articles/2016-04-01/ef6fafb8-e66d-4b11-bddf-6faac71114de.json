Hazard scored twice as Chelsea beat Bournemouth in an entertaining match during which Cesc F\u00e0bregas orchestrated the tempo in midfield, with Pedro and Willian also scoring for the champions. Remarkably, considering Hazard was the PFA Player of the Year last season, these were his first Premier League goals since May 2015. His campaign has been hampered significantly by injury, although there were question marks about his hunger under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. In February, Hazard said it would be \u201cdifficult to say no to PSG\u201d following speculation linking him with a summer move to Paris, although he has since claimed he is happy at Chelsea. Hiddink, who will be replaced by the Italian Antonio Conte at the end of the European Championship, said of Hazard: \u201cIt\u2019s a very bad season, we do not like to neglect the facts. It\u2019s difficult for a talented, high-quality player like Hazard. I think this season he had a very difficult season, falling into injuries coming back, nearly back, playing half a game and then falling back into injuries. It\u2019s frustrating. \u201cThen we said, let\u2019s train well, let\u2019s treat him well and take a little more time so that when you come back you\u2019ll be back well. He showed that today. When he is there fully fit physically and mentally \u2013 which is always an influence on each other \u2013 then he is one of the best. Whenever he could participate in team training, I noticed that I saw him moving more, very light, very fresh, and he was enjoying it and making jokes when he was playing. He was playing free with no doubt in his mind and any frustrations so this was a good sign for me. \u201cAfter having a bad season normally you are a little bit touched, a little bit hurt as a player and I think he has the capacity to gain it back in the coming years. I don\u2019t know exactly but he has some more years to go [on his contract]. \u201cWhat I know he is very happy with everything in Chelsea and around Chelsea. He is very important and if he is fit as he is today showing, not fully fit, he will be very important again next season.\u201d F\u00e0bregastore Bournemouth apart with effective back-flicks and decisive passing, creating three goals, and Hiddink believes the Spaniard excels when in a more advanced position. Chelsea\u2019s next home game is against Tottenham Hotspur, potentially a decisive one for the north London club in the race for the Premier League title, and the away fans on the south coast voiced their appetite for denting Spurs\u2019 hopes. On F\u00e0bregas, Hiddink said: \u201cHe has this very quick vision. To have the vision on the pitch and to execute that is the main problem of many players but he has that. When he is a little bit in an advanced position he does not have to do the defensive work so much and he can concentrate a little bit more on his speciality. \u201cHe has also, as everybody in the team had, difficult times until December and January when we climbed up. Today I think was a perfect performance of his. He is also important when surrounded by players who can help him defensively, so that he can use his quality, it\u2019s nice to see from him and also from the other players.\u201d Bournemouth created a number of chances during a relatively even first half, but despite Tommy Elphick\u2019s goal Eddie Howe conceded his team had work to do to establish themselves in the Premier League. \u201cWe\u2019re learning all the time and we\u2019re learning on the job,\u201d Howe said. \u201cThere\u2019s no easy way to become an established Premier League club, there are going to be some tough days. This was one of the best I\u2019ve seen Chelsea play in recent weeks. I just think it\u2019s an overall evolution of the team to progress and become stronger.\u201d Man of the match Cesc F\u00e0bregas (Chelsea)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
