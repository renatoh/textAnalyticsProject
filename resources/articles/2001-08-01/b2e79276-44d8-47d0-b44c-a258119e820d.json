More than 36,000 people, a record for this stage of the competition, saw them negotiate a rugged challenge from 1860 Munich and earn a place in their group final. Gary Speed sent Bobby Robson's team on their way to a hard-earned success with an early goal before Munich's resistance was ended by a goal from Lomana Lua-Lua. The substitute had been involved for less than two minutes when he rounded the keeper to score from a tight angle in the 79th minute. Nolberto Solano completed a good night for Newcastle with a 90th-minute penalty. Robson illustrated his admiration for Robert Lee's midfield experience by calling him up at the earliest possible opportunity following knee surgery at the end of last season. Christian Bassedas was the player left out as Robson made his first change during an Intertoto run which featured a comfortable victory over Sporting Lokeren in the previous round. Newcastle knew the Germans, 11th in the Bundesliga last season, would provide more formidable opposition, although Robson's team coped admirably in the Olympic Stadium seven days earlier. Munich's awkward task was made seemingly impossible after just five minutes. Solano, scorer of two goals in the first leg, continued to torment Munich as he whipped in a fifth-minute free kick which Speed met with a stinging header from eight yards. 1860 largely lacked the ingenuity to trouble Newcastle's three-man defensive line for much of the first-half. Solano and Wayne Quinn - the player presumably on borrowed time following Robert's entrance - offered width, while the mobility and verve of Ameobi and Craig Bellamy again hinted that Alan Shearer and Carl Cort can't be guaranteed automatic call-ups following their operations. Munich finally roused themselves after half an hour, though. Daniel Borimov's low cross in the 31st minute narrowly eluded striker Markus Schroth - a preview of a goal that was to come ten minutes later. Then Martin Max, whose omission from the first leg was a major error by the Germans, escaped Nikos Dabizas and drove in a shot which was marginally too high. The right-wing runs of Borimov finally produced a dividend after 41 minutes. He advanced to the byline and, on this occasion, his cross was met decisively by Schroth to offer the Germans badly-needed encouragement. Troyes, from the champagne area of France, now stand between Newcastle and a place in the Uefa Cup and, in new signing, Laurent Robert, they have the ideal man to inform them about the team that finished ninth in their league last season. Robert, a \u00a310m signing, was given a rapturous reception from the fans last night before watching the match from the stands. He will have been impressed.
