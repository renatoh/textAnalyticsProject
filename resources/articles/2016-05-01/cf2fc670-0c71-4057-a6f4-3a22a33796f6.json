Fahim Khondaker, of the Islamic Council of Queensland, and Brad Chilcott, of the Activate church, have set up a pledge website where donors can pledge their $6 tax cut every week to one of 10 high-profile charities. \u201cIf you earn over $80,000 you just got a tax cut of $6/week,\u201d the website says. \u201c75% of Australians miss out on this, including millions of Australians for whom $6 can make a big difference. \u201cRather than buying an extra coffee or two, many of us would prefer that our tax cuts helped people who could really use it.\u201d Khondaker said they had come up with the idea after listening to people suggesting the tax cuts were unfair but individually would not amount to much. \u201cI wanted a platform where people could do something tangible rather than just talk about it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that philanthropy is no replacement for a fair tax system \u2013 and so want to make it possible for like-minded Australians to help make our nation fairer. \u201cIf you\u2019re a person who\u2019ll benefit from these changes and believe that money would achieve more if it were spent empowering people at the other end of the income spectrum \u2013 helping people with disabilities find stable employment, providing support for vulnerable young people and serving victims of family and domestic violence \u2013 we\u2019re inviting you to share your tax cut for the sake of Australia\u2019s future.\u201d The website is simply a pledge system, which will record the pledge and then direct the donor to one of 10 nominated charities. Week after week, the amounts will be aggregated and reported."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
