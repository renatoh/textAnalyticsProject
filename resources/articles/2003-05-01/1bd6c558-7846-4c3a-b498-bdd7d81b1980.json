The 25-year-old Southampton and England striker, scorer of 23 goals this season, has been linked with various summer moves, the latest being to Newcastle United, but Beattie did his best to switch attention from talk of putative transfers yesterday as Southampton's players prepared for the FA Cup final at the Millennium Stadium. \"I signed a new contract four months ago,\" Beattie said. \"I'm happy, very settled and I've got a new life. As far as I'm concerned I'll be coming back to Southampton next season. Obviously I'm not going to say that I'm not ambitious as a player, but first and foremost we have got a Cup final on Saturday.\" Beattie joined Southampton from Blackburn Rovers five years ago for \u00a31m and has scored in bursts during his time on the south coast. But this season he has sustained his scoring, having waited until Southampton's 11th match - at Aston Villa in October - to score his first. That form took Beattie into the England squad but, after making his debut against Australia in the friendly at Upton Park in February, he was omitted from the squad for the European Championship qualifier in Sunderland against Turkey. On Monday he was recalled for next month's game against Slovakia at the Riverside, although the Cup final means he will not go to South Africa for the friendly on May 22. Chris Marsden, Beattie's Southampton team-mate, said he thinks he will be fit for the final despite not having trained for almost a fortnight because of knee ligament trouble. \"I expect to play,\" the 34-year-old midfielder said yesterday. He will have two more injections in his knee before a decision is taken after training tomorrow. \"Last Friday I could hardly move but it's a lot easier now. It's getting better every day,\" Marsden added. The goalkeeper Antti Niemi, who has also been absent with a knee injury, said he did not know whether or not he will get the vote ahead of Paul Jones in goal. \"It's difficult. I don't really know. I've had a week of training before the final but the decision is up to the manager,\" he said. Jim Clunie, Southampton's trainer for the 1976 FA Cup final win over Manchester United, has died at the age of 69. Clunie, who was Lawrie McMenemy's assistant at Southampton and Grimsby, died at his home in Scotland after a short illness. The former St Mirren manager was due to attend a reunion dinner along with other surviving members of Southampton's Cup-winning squad on the eve of Saturday's final."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
