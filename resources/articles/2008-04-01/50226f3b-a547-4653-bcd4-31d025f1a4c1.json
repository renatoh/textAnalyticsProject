Rather than watching Kings of Leon strum tunes to cowboy-hatted teenagers you'll get jousting and torchlit parades at the Festival M\u00e9di\u00e9val de Sedan (medieval-sedan.com, May 17-18); sample black and white pudding and the potato dish \"naked bottom pot\" at the gastronomic Festival des Confr\u00e9ries (Charleville-M\u00e9zi\u00e8res, May 3-4); or learn about smuggling at the Festival Contrebande (Revin, April 30-May 1). For something a little more rock and roll there's a beer festival in Charleville-M\u00e9zi\u00e8res (May 10-12) or comedy and local bands at the Festival de la Cassine (la-cassine.com, May 30-31) in Vendresse.
