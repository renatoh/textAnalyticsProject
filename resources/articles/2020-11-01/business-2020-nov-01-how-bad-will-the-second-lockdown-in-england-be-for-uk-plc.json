This, after all, is deja vu time, and back in the spring during lockdown 1 activity collapsed. Between February and April gross domestic product fell by a quarter. So when a Whitehall insider says \u201cit\u2019s going to be bad\u201d in response to a question about the likely impact of the lockdown, that\u2019s a statement of the blindingly obvious. What\u2019s at issue is just how bad. The answer is that even a four-week shutdown will take a sizeable chunk out of GDP because the sectors that will be hardest hit \u2013 retail, hospitality, travel, tourism \u2013 make up such a big chunk of the economy, around 15% of all activity. For retail and hospitality the lockdown could hardly have come at a worse time because both sectors usually see takings rise markedly in November and December. For many businesses a good end to the year is the difference between making a profit or loss, and there is a risk that bars and restaurants that just about clung on through the first lockdown will throw in the towel this time. In part, that\u2019s because there is no certainty about how long the closures will go on for. As Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, put it: \u201cI can\u2019t say I am terribly confident we will be out of this by 2 December\u201d. The IFS \u2013 a thinktank that specialises in the public finances \u2013 had yet to do serious number crunching on what the lockdown would do to the government\u2019s budget deficit, but was forecasting a shortfall of \u00a3350bn even before the new restrictions were announced. Johnson\u2019s best guess is that the lockdown will add \u00a320bn to the total. \u201cThere will be a loss of tax revenues and at least one month of full furlough. There were 2-3 million people on furlough in September and the figure in November is likely to be double that.\u201d Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the economy was unlikely to take as severe a hit as that suffered in April, when it shrank by 20%. \u201cNot everything is going to be closed this time,\u201d Dales said. \u201cPeople are more used to working from home and the schools are going to stay open. Shutting schools took a lot off GDP both directly and indirectly because parents had to take time off work to look after their children.\u201d Dales said there was one other reason the contraction would be less severe: even after its recovery since May the economy is around 5% smaller than it was before the crisis. \u201cIt has less far to fall\u201d, he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
