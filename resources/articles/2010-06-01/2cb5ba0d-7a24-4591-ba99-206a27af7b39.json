The cost of insuring Greek debt exploded again . Investors are asking whether the European Central Bank can be relied upon to continue to pour liquidity into the fragile eurozone banking system. The good news is that British banks have raised their capital and liquidity buffers \"substantially,\" according to the report. Capital ratios stand at their highest level for more than a decade and UK banks now look much stronger than their continental cousins on this measure. All those rights issues and recapitalisations in the UK have also done wonders for leverage ratios, which have fallen from 30 times in 2008 to 20 times. Job done? Absolutely not. In one of Bank's graphs, British banks are horribly out of kilter with the rest of Europe and the US. They are too exposed to short-term funding pressures. In the UK, the largest banks need to replace \u00a3750bn to \u00a3800bn of loans and assets by the end of 2012. That's \u00a325bn a month and the banks are running at half that pace. There is plenty of long-term money in the world looking for a home, especially in Asia. At the moment, though, there's a stand-off. The banks don't want to pay inflated rates; investors think they will eventually and are prepared to wait. Buyers and sellers, one assumes, will come together but the Bank clearly wishes they'd get on with it. \"Disruption to key funding markets could heighten the significant refinancing challenge facing banks internationally,\" says the report. Banks could, of course, do themselves a mighty favour by trimming bonuses. The most eye-catching graph in the report is (once again) the one that shows how much extra capital could be saved via lower \"discretionary distributions,\" as the Bank describes dividends and compensation. Last year British banks could have accumulated an extra \u00a310bn, rather than \u00a32.5bn, if compensation ratios had returned to levels seen in 2005. It's not the Bank's job to prescribe lower bonuses. It's up to shareholders to demand it \u2013 they should wake up."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
