A police patrol pulled the car over after it drove by without its headlights on early on Friday. They discovered the boy behind the wheel when they opened the driver's door. It's alleged his father was drunk in the passenger seat beside him. A 41-year-old NSW man has been charged with dangerous operation of a motor vehicle and being an adult in charge under the influence of liquor. He is expected to fact Southport Magistrates Court on 3 July. The boy is reportedly in the care of relatives after they travelled from NSW following the incident, which happened on The Esplanade at Surfers Paradise. The father failed a roadside breath test. Police could not confirm media reports he was three times over the legal blood alcohol limit. Royal Automobile Club Queensland (RACQ) senior road safety adviser Joel Tucker said the case was shocking. \"Children at that age don't have the mental or physical capabilities to drive a car safely,\" Tucker told AAP. \"It is a real concern to hear that children were being put in that position.\" Tucker said incidents of underage driving were rare in Queensland. \"This is a unique case, it's not something we hear about regularly and that's a good thing.\" Tucker said apart from the obvious physical problems with someone so young driving a car, the child's inability to understand basic road rules or how a car operates makes it highly dangerous. \"The age to drive by yourself in Queensland is 17 years and that's after having done 100 hours of supervised experience and passing a driving test,\" he said. \"They don't have the skills, ability or knowledge and nor should they at that age.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
