But three things are liable for a good swatting: mosquitoes, horseflies and midges. Mosquitoes at least have the courtesy to whine a warning and midges to travel in a crowd, but the horsefly is a stealthy, underhand creature. Silent in habit and dowdy of dress, often the first sign of its presence is an apparent jab from a red hot needle. Adult horseflies feed on nectar, but the females, requiring a blood meal for reproduction, will use their mandibles to scissor through skin. Though you may curse and slap at the offender, by the time it tumbles groundwards it is already too late and you are in for an uncomfortable couple of days. It's a test of willpower not to rub at the hot and painful sites. In recompense for the dreaded clegs there are also exquisite creatures in the air \u2013 and two of them are common blues. The butterflies of that name are a constant delight, fluttering across the multi-hued machair like tiny scraps of fallen sky. Males and the smaller, browner females weave spirals around each other and dance off into the distance. And, further inland, what more beautiful colour combination could one see than this cerulean butterfly, its wings delicately fringed with white, at rest on the imperial purple of the heather? In contrast, the other common blue \u2013 a damselfly \u2013 is all lines, direct flight and precision. A needle of electric blue standing out from its surroundings despite its slenderness, it is patterned with black markings, those on the second segment varying from a simple spot to the spear shape most common in Scottish specimens. With its brilliant colour and darting movements, it seems to vanish and reappear as if flicking in and out of being."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
