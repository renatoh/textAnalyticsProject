Along with the disposal of the air traffic control system, Dera (the defence development agency) and the Commonwealth Development Corporation, the sale of Britain's state-licensed pool betting monopoly, set up in 1929 to channel funds from betting back into horse racing, represents a continuing commitment to privatisation that many Labour supporters find hard to stomach. The government's change of heart over the Tote owes much to the persuasiveness of Mr Jones, appointed by Labour to head the public corporation in 1997 following the death of Lord Wyatt. Where Lord Wyatt cast himself as cantankerous autocrat, Mr Jones has impressed his political bosses by fostering a more sober commercial ethos. Disappointing degree That said, Mr Jones, 58, is no disinterested bean-counter. A keen punter, he talks enthusiastically about today's Derby at Epsom. \"I've decided to go for a horse with slightly long odds: Storming Home. It finished very strongly in the Dante Stakes and is good value at 14-1 [yesterday's price]. Dilshaan is the one he's got to beat; Storming Home finished behind Dilshaan in the Dante at York but I think there's slightly better value in Storming Home.\" Since the age of eight, when his father took him to his first race meeting, Mr Jones has had a passion for all things sporting. With a flair for statistical analysis, he studied form through his teenage years in south-east London and blames the dog track for a disappointing degree (a 2:2 in economics and statistics). Soon after leaving university, he bought a stake in his first horse, Bob's Vision - a winner at 14-1 on its debut. With his wife, he now owns five. Mr Jones is also a passionate supporter of Charlton Athletic football club and a regular at the Valley. He is often to be spotted at the cricket, international athletics, golf and rugby. It is an indication of his energy that despite such a packed fixtures list he has also managed an impressive career in advertising. Mr Jones's case for privatisation is simple: the Tote needs to be free of state control and able to make independent commercial decisions if it is to thrive in the increasingly competitive bookmaking market. The result will be an increase on the \u00a314m a year ploughed back into racing. He says Labour's opposition to privatisation softened when it realised that a sale on the open market - with the attendant flurry of excitement in the City and indignation from backbench Labour MPs - was not the only option. Mr Jones, who headed a Tote review steering group for the Home Office, has suggested a sale, possibly on a 15-year licence, to a racing trust incorporating a broad range of interests from the racing world. On receipt of Mr Jones's proposals - which, in truth, added little to informal plans floated by Lord Wyatt and others as early as 1986 - Jack Straw last year informed parliament of the government's policy reversal. \"I have concluded that the sale of the Tote to racing represents the best match with the government's objectives,\" the then home secretary said. Under the racing trust plan, all Tote profits would continue to be channelled back into racing. Whatever the advantages, it is unlikely to generate much of a windfall for the Treasury. \"No one knows what the government will ask for,\" Mr Jones says. \"But the figure that has been most often bandied about is \u00a350m [thought to be about 25% of the value of an open sale] - which would be raised as debt on the Tote's balance sheet.\" Critics consider such a price to be an unconscionable discount on a taxpayer-owned business. Others point out that the government has never subsidised the Tote, nor has the Treasury ever received revenue beyond standard taxes. Mr Jones seeks the middle ground. \"The fact of the matter is that the Tote has benefited from an exclusive arrangement granted by the government since 1929. In that context, it is very difficult to say that the government has made no contribution - it has made no financial contribution, but it has made a contribution in kind.\" On the other hand: \"I think the government recognises that it does not wholly own the Tote. If the proposed racing trust picks up the Tote for a sum of money that is less than its full market value, that will reflect the government true stake.\" The Tote is a healthy business, viewed with with envy by bookmakers and others. According to Lord Wyatt's memoirs: \"They see the Tote as a cash cow - which it is; it is a very good business generating a lot of cash.\" The latest financial results, to be released next month at the Savoy Hotel, are expected to show that, while profits for the year to April have been set back by the highest number of abandoned meetings in living memory, the Tote remains in good shape, with turnover increasing. 'Learned a lot' Opponents warn that the trust model could end up being a transitional phase before the Tote passes to a profit-seeking bookmaking interest. \"I don't have a great deal of control over that,\" Mr Jones admits, despite being the proposed first chairman of the privatised Tote. \"But I think the government will be very careful: it is going to be very wary about criticisms it might face if the Tote trust turns around in very short order and makes a fat profit. It has learned a lot about privatisation in that respect.\" Having made a fortune in advertising, much of it ploughed straight into his racing interests, Mr Jones is unlikely to look for a fast buck on the Tote sale and many continue to regard him as the key to a secure future for the business. As for the timescale, Mr Jones is not holding his breath. \"We don't know if the Tote is going to be sold over the next 12 months or over the next 12 years. It is obviously helpful to have had a manifesto commitment, but you could paper your wall with unmet manifesto commitments, couldn't you?\" The CV Born: Hampshire, December 14, 1942.
