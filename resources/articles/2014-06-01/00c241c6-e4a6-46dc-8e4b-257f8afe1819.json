Sadly, the results (which debuted in Toronto back in 2012) are completely disposable, as Firth's divorced dad pulls a Reggie Perrin identity switch, and teams up with Blunt's glamorously overdosing waif. On the run from their respective pasts, the odd couple head off in search of his under-par dreams, stopping en route to have break-in sex with falsely assumed identities and underwear. For a while, the leads make the most of it \u2013 Firth all bumbling Englishness (despite a wobbly American accent) and Blunt alternately stroppy, pouty and needy. But fun turns to fatuousness as the past rears its messy head, leaving the movie to wrestle clumsily with estranged sons, schizophrenic twins, and a frankly inexplicable Anne Heche."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
