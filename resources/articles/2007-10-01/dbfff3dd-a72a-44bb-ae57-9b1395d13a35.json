These days swing between glorious sunshine and crepuscular mists - which define a true autumn. Because there was no true summer, the alternating vividness and mystery of this autumn has gained a deeper significance. People are taking photographs, as if to squirrel away something of the essential character of these days through images. Local harvest festivals, weighed down with the gathering in of woes this year, are given an optimistic lift by sudden, ripening weather. In the church, the congregation gives thanks for the bounties and beauties of nature. And when they've finished, men continue felling trees in the churchyard, shoving pencil-scented branches through a big yellow chipper. In a cool morning mist, a hawker dragonfly zips through indefinable spaces between trees and shrubs, hunting for the few insects that may be flying. But the hunter is also hunted. A cat is in seek-and-destroy mode, flat against the grass. The cat leaps a metre into the mist, snatches the dragonfly. My allegiances are instinctive and I rush the cat. Miraculously, the dragonfly whirs off. In another mist, there is a sudden panic and all the small birds crash through branches for the shelter of hedges yelling their alarms. I assume it's a hawk. A day later, in bright sunshine, a buzzard passes at head height, the lowest I've seen over the gardens of Wenlock. On top of the Wrekin, the sky is brilliant blue, trees are touched by an inspiring fire and ravens slide the breeze. On top of Catacomb Hill at Weston under Redcastle, the sky is misty grey and the landscape is lost in its hopelessly romantic dream. Today, the air is crystal clear and full of the sound of chainsaws reducing beautiful trees to logs and dust."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
