Under a plan announced last November by the trade and industry secretary, Patricia Hewitt, the government agreed to roll over a \u00a3650m loan to the firm until next March. The government will also pay out \u00a3150m-\u00a3200m a year for the next 10 years to cover the company's nuclear fuel liabilities. The provisions of the electricity (miscellaneous provisions) bill unveiled today will also ease the way for the government to place British Energy into administration if required. The campaign group Friends of the Earth said the government was effectively \"bailing out\" British Energy to the tune of \u00a33bn. \"This bill paves the way for British Energy to fob the costs of dealing with its nuclear waste on to the taxpayer,\" said FoE nuclear campaigner Roger Higman. \"It is a \u00a33bn back-door payment to nuclear power. It shows yet again that nuclear power is a financial as well as an environmental disaster,\" said Mr Higman. The Liberal Democrats warned they would oppose the legislation. \"The funding of nuclear power has proven to be the worst investment decision in modern British history,\" said the Lib Dems' trade and industry spokesman, Vince Cable. \"In propping up a private company with public money, the government's behaviour is reckless in the extreme. \"The prospect of future investment in nuclear power is ludicrous in the absence of solutions to the long-term problems of decommissioning and nuclear waste,\" said Mr Cable. The energy minister, Brian Wilson, defended the bill, saying it would enable ministers to deal with any eventuality faced by British Energy. \"These are sensible provisions which will continue to protect our priorities of nuclear safety and the security of electricity supplies,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
