On the TK Maxx label it gives a recommended retail price, RRP, and a discounted \"Our price\". When I got home I found the original Crew Clothing Co. label still attached to the garment stating its RRP price had been \u00a340. TK Maxx had given a RRP price of \u00a360. Is it OK for TK Maxx to make up its own RRP? LH, Norfolk Well spotted! We sent TK Maxx a copy of the offending label and it admits its error. In a statement, it says: \"Transparency and integrity are critical to our business and our relationship with our customers. We have stringent requirements and expectations around how our buyers establish the correct RRP. That said, with up to 10,000 new items going through every store every week, the occasional one-off error can be made.\" TK Maxx has apologised to you directly and sent you a \u00a340 gift card to cover the value of fleece. We welcome letters but cannot answer individually. Email us at consumer.champions@theguardian.com or write to Bachelor &amp; Brignall, Money, the Guardian, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.
