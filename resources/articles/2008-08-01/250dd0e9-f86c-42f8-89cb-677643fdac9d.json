He made a considerable international impression with his feature debut, The Return, five years ago, and his second film, The Banishment, won a best actor award and divided critics at Cannes last year. Visually striking, it's based on William Saroyan's 1953 novel about his own marriage, The Laughing Matter, set in California. The film, which is no laughing matter, takes place in a unnamed country sometime in the recent past, the urban scenes shot in depopulated Belgian industrial cities, the rural sequences in the thinly populated, rolling countryside of Moldova, the landlocked republic between Romania and Ukraine . It opens like a thriller as the middleaged Mark drives from the country to the shabby, inner-city flat of his younger brother Alex. He has a bullet in his left arm and insists Alex removes it without bringing in a doctor. We suppose Mark to be a criminal, but we're never told. We don't know what Alex does for a living, nor is it clear why he decides to leave the city with his handsome wife Vera (Norwegian actress Maria Bonnevie, a leading member of the Swedish National Theatre) and two small children to stay at their family's remote, rundown house in the idyllic countryside. Everything happens slowly, deliberately, mysteriously over two hours and 40 minutes and we watch more hypnotised than intellectually engaged. A depressed Vera tells Alex she's pregnant and that he isn't the father, though we learn, much later, that she's talking philosophically or ethically rather than referring to something as mundane as adultery. There follows an abortion, two deaths, an extended bedtime reading by a neighbour's daughter from Paul's Epistle to the Corinthians about faith, hope and love, and an extremely clumsy flashback explaining Vera's state of mind that brings to mind similar sequences in Ingmar Bergman films. The movie plays out over haymaking peasants singing and a choral piece in Old Slavonic by that current art-house favourite Arvo P\u00e4rt. It's well acted, self-important, none too convincing and enigmatic in an unsatisfactory way."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
