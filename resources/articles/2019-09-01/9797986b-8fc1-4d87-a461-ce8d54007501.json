The announcement had been expected to be made by Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, at the DSEI arms fair this week, but it has been taken by Downing Street, desperate for positive news after days of negative headlines and controversy. Downing Street\u2019s overnight announcement does not name the preferred bidder, although the winner was announced on Thursday as a consortium led by the smaller of Britain\u2019s two main shipbuilders, Babcock. With a clear post-Brexit emphasis, Johnson said that he believes that building the frigates in the UK will prompt \u201ca renaissance in this industry which is so much part of our island story\u201d and added \u201cso let\u2019s bring shipbuilding home\u201d. Few, however, expected the new frigates \u2013 cut-price models intended to be attractive to the export markets \u2013 to be built overseas. Babcock\u2019s principal competitor was BAE Systems, which owns the Scotstoun and Govan shipyards on the Clyde. But the contract does help ensure a diversity of supply, safeguarding jobs at the Babcock-owned dockyard in Fife until 2028, when the last of the ships is due to be built. The yards are just completing the second of two \u00a36.2bn aircraft carriers, with the Prince of Wales expected to set sail within days. The prime minister is expected provide further details on Thursday, although he will not travel to Scotland and is instead expected to appear in London against a maritime backdrop, although the exact location is not yet known. The Royal Navy has 19 warships, with the two aircraft carriers coming into service early in the next decade. Ministers want to increase that number in the 2030s after the navy was stretched trying to defend oil tankers under threat from Iran in the Persian Gulf. Mike Clancy, general secretary of Prospect, which represents defence engineers, said the announcement was welcome after a period of \u201cdamaging delay\u201d but said the UK needed to build up naval strength. \u201cEvents in the Gulf this summer have shown that 19 frigates should be an absolute minimum for the Royal Navy. So this first order of five warships must be followed up by further orders.\u201d Johnson also said he would appoint Wallace as \u201cshipbuilding tsar\u201d with a broader responsibility for making the UK a leader in creating cruise ships, ferries and yachts \u2013 lifting its position from third worldwide. Earlier on Wednesday, the defence secretary said China needed to modify its cyber-behaviour and adopt a code of \u201cfair play\u201d if Beijing wanted the British government to allow Huawei technology to be used in future 5G mobile networks. Wallace said a long-awaited decision on Huawei was coming soon, although he could not give a firm date, and told the DSEI arms fair any conclusions about the company had to be \u201cmore than just technical\u201d. Spelling out an additional condition, the minister said: \u201cThis is also about behaviour. You know, it wasn\u2019t that long ago that the United Kingdom and other nations called out China for some of its cyber-activity publicly. \u201cIf we are going to allow countries access to our market, I think we should all expect a code of behaviour that is fair play \u2013 we are British, we believe in fair play. So I think that will also be reflected in those discussions.\u201d Wallace, however, conceded the Brexit crisis had delayed the timing of any announcement. The minister said he could not provide an exact timetable because \u201cobviously there\u2019s been some chop in the government, up and down\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
