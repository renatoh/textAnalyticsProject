Taylor, who managed Villa between 1988 and 1990, joined the board as a non-executive director after retiring from club management last summer. But he is considered unlikely to accept the post. \"I have told Doug [Ellis, the Villa chairman] that I will not become a club manager again,\" he had said last year. \"Not [even] as a caretaker. Not even for a week.\" A temporary manager would enable Villa to assess their options, and possibly move for the Republic of Ireland manager Mick McCarthy, whose contract expires after the World Cup."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
