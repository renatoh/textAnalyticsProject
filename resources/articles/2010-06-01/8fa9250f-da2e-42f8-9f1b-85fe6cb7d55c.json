The armed forces. All of them, 9 June) claims that it costs the UK taxpayer \"\u00a345bn to protect the Falklands, Gibraltar and the Caymans\". In fact, it will cost the UK taxpayer \u00a369m to maintain a military presence on the Falklands Islands in 2010-11, representing less than 0.5% of the UK's total defence budget. This represents extremely good value given that the security of the islands are assured and the MoD has access to a first class tri-service training area that helps ensure that all branches of the British armed services are fully prepared for operational duties. Jenkins's continued use of the term \"colonies\" is both anachronistic and inaccurate. The term's last official use was in 1981 when we changed from being crown colonies to British dependent territories. We became British overseas territories in 2002. These name changes are not exercises in semantics either, but reflect the changing relationship between ourselves and the UK. We, in particular, have made tremendous strides in developing our economy and we are proud of the fact that we require no budgetary aid from the UK. In fact, should oil be recovered from our territorial waters in commercial quantities, then we should be able to make an even bigger contribution to the cost of our defence. There is no doubt that the UK economy will benefit from any such development.
