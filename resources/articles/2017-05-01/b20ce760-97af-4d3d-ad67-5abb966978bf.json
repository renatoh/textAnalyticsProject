Jones, 31, made the remarks in a wide-ranging interview with Yahoo Sports published on Tuesday. \u201cAs athletes, we do have to be censored in a certain way, but at the same time, if there\u2019s a big issue, and it\u2019s something you stand for, you\u2019ve got to speak out,\u201d Jones said. \u201cBecause if you\u2019re worried about the backlash, I think silence is just as bad.\u201d Jones said he wants to use the Fenway Park incident as a platform to discuss racial inequalities in baseball and society at large. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of the backlash, because it\u2019s the truth,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIt\u2019s my truth through my eyes. We all have our own truths. How we were raised \u2013 that\u2019s our truth. Growing up in San Diego, or California in general, it\u2019s a very liberal state. I grew up with blacks, whites, Mexicans, Filipinos. Everything was diverse. My class wasn\u2019t predominately anything. Playing sports, it was diverse. My neighborhood was diverse. \u201cThe worst thing is when people say, \u2018I don\u2019t see color.\u2019 I think that\u2019s the dumbest thing. Unless you\u2019re colorblind, you see color. You may choose not to think of the other things that come with color, but you see color. At the ballpark in San Diego, you see the diversity. LA, Arizona, San Francisco, both Texas teams. You just see so much diversity. Growing up like that, I always assumed the rest of the United States, the rest of the world, was like that.\u201d Jones gave the interview while in Kansas City to announce his $20,000 donation to the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, only two weeks after he said he was called the N-word and had a bag of peanuts thrown in his direction in Boston. When asked about naysayers like former Boston Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling, who said that Jones was lying about the racist heckling he endured during the 1 May game (which prompted an apology from the team and a lifetime ban for a fan involved), Jones doubted the outspoken conservative\u2019s ability to sympathize with his experience. \u201cSchilling is over there with his rants,\u201d Jones said. \u201cHe just wants an outlet. Somebody will take his call, take his rants. He can keep them for himself. Because he\u2019s never experienced anything like I have. I\u2019ll stick with what [Mark] McLemore said about it: Schilling, hell of a career. But he\u2019s never been black, and he\u2019s never played the outfield in Boston. Last year, Jones claimed major league baseball players were loath to join in on Colin Kaepernick\u2019s national anthem protest because \u201cbaseball is a white man\u2019s sport\u201d, with African American players comprising just 8% of last year\u2019s rosters league-wide compared to 68% in the NFL. Jones expounded on those remarks in Tuesday\u2019s interview, pointing to a lack of diversity in the game\u2019s management and executive positions. Yet his response took a firmly political tack when it came to baseball\u2019s languishing participation numbers among African American youth. \u201cIt\u2019s bigger than just baseball,\u201d Jones said. \u201cAnd this is what I believe: Baseball always has been a father-son game. You play catch with your dad-type game. The last 30 years, especially in California with the three-strike policy that (Ronald) Reagan and (George HW) Bush \u2013 the three-strike policy in general \u2013 there aren\u2019t as many black fathers out there to play catch. The mother is turned into a single mother. She doesn\u2019t have the time, the energy, because she just worked a double. \u201cThe availability of the parent is not there to play with the kid. The neighborhood is fine, but baseball is generally taught from father to son, even if the dad didn\u2019t play. I just think that with the African-American father not as involved with the life of the kid \u2013 that\u2019s way bigger than baseball. \u201cIt\u2019s real life tying into sports.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
