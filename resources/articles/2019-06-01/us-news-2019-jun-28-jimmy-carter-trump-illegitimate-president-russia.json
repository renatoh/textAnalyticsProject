At a conference for his human rights organization the Carter Center, the former president said a full investigation \u201cwould show that Trump didn\u2019t actually win the election in 2016\u201d. \u201cHe lost the election and he was put into office because the Russians interfered on his behalf,\u201d Carter added. The event moderator, Jon Meacham, asked if that meant Carter thought that Trump was an illegitimate president. Carter then briefly paused and replied: \u201cBased on what I just said, which I can\u2019t retract,\u201d Carter said. The remark then triggered laughter in the audience and from Meacham. Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election, and the Kremlin\u2019s ties to Trump\u2019s campaign, were exhaustively investigated by Robert Mueller. In his 448-page report, submitted in April, the special counsel concluded there was not enough evidence to establish a conspiracy between Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and Russia. But he did detail numerous incidents of Russian interference, many of which have led to indictments. Carter also called for Trump to condemn Russia for their actions and said the current president should \u201cadmit that it happened\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the Russians did interfere in the election,\u201d he said. On Friday Trump, and Vladimir Putin met at the G20 summit in Japan \u2013 and Trump jokingly raised the issue. As the pair sat for photographs, a reporter asked if Trump would tell Putin not to meddle in the 2020 US election. Without looking at Putin, Trump said: \u201cDon\u2019t meddle in the election, please.\u2019\u201d He then repeated the phrase with a mock finger wag."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
