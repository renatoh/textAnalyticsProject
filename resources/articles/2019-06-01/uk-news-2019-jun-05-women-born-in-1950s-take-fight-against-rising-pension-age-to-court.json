Nearly 4 million women have been forced to wait up to an extra six years to get their pensions after changes to bring women\u2019s retirement age into line with men\u2019s. Two claimants have now taken the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to court, arguing that raising their pension age \u201cunlawfully discriminated against them on the grounds of age, sex, and age and sex combined\u201d. On the first day of the landmark legal case on Wednesday, Michael Mansfield QC said: \u201cAlthough the object of the exercise was intended to be equalisation of treatment, in fact what has happened is the reverse.\u201d Addressing a court packed with supporters from the campaign group BackTo60, Mansfield said that \u201croughly 3.8 million\u201d women had been affected by the changes. The barrister said raising the state pension age discriminated against women born after 1950 on the grounds of their age, and also put women \u201cat a particular disadvantage to men\u201d. He submitted that \u201cthe claimants and many other women born in the 1950s\u201d were not told about the changes \u201cuntil shortly before their expected state pension age at 60\u201d, which caused \u201csignificant detriments\u201d to many of them. Mansfield said many of the women expected to reach state pension age at 60 because that was \u201cthe practice and legislation in place for most of their working lives\u201d. He added that women born in the 1950s had already suffered \u201cconsiderable inequalities in the workplace\u201d, which he said were the result of \u201chistorical factors and social expectations\u201d. Sir James Eadie QC, representing the DWP, argued that the changes were intended \u201cto equalise the state pension age between the sexes\u201d and \u201cto ensure intergenerational fairness as between those in receipt of state pensions and the younger taxpayers funding them\u201d. He added that the aim of raising the pension age to 66 was also to \u201cmake pensions affordable ... and to control government expenditure at a time of great pressure on public finances\u201d. Sir James submitted that the government took \u201cextensive\u201d steps to notify women of the change to their state pension age, and added that \u201cpersonal notification would have been very difficult if not impossible prior to 2003\u201d. He concluded that the changes \u201cpursue obviously legitimate aims\u201d, and that they \u201cstrike a balance between the public interest and the claimants\u2019 interests\u201d. Before the hearing BackTo60 said that many of the women did not find out about the changes until they went to get their pension or were finally sent an official letter 16 years after the changes were made, leaving them with no time to make alternative financial arrangements. \u201cWe\u2019re in an exquisite position today,\u201d said Joanne Welch from BackTo60, which is seeking repayments of all the pensions that people born in the 1950s would have received if they had been able to retire earlier. \u201cWe have done everything we could possibly have done to place ourselves in a powerful legal position. \u201cWe have so much to say and we expect our claim to be granted. And why wouldn\u2019t we? Laws have been broken and when that happens, the judiciary acts accordingly,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat some people don\u2019t realise is that the women involved were on their knees when we started this campaign and now they\u2019re warriors.\u201d Women in their 50s and 60s have been hit by the government\u2019s decision under the 1995 Pensions Act to increase the female state pension age from 60 to 65. The change was to be phased in between 2010 and 2020. The coalition government of 2010 then decided to accelerate the timetable. The 2011 Pension Act bought the new qualifying age of 65 for women forward to 2018. The qualifying age for both men and women will be raised to 66 by October 2020. BackTo60 argues that women were not given time to adjust to the new retirement age and also that the changes in 2011 and 1995 had not been clearly communicated."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
