Bebo, founded by British-born Michael Birch and his partner Xochi in 2005, claims to have around 40 million monthly users worldwide. The surprise deal marks a major push by AOL to grow its social media business, which consists of AIM, a cross between messaging and social networking, and personal communications network ICQ. AOL said that the acquisition of Bebo, which has gone beyond its social networking roots to launch online dramas such as Kate Modern and strike deals with TV broadcasters, will give it a \"network of approximately 80 million unique users\". Randy Falco, the chairman and chief executive of AOL, said: \"Bebo is the perfect complement to AOL's personal communications network and puts us in a leading position in social media. \"What drew us to Bebo was its substantial and fast-growing worldwide user base, its vision of a truly social web, and the monetisation opportunities that leverage Platform A across our combined global audience. \"This positions us to offer advertisers even greater reach and marketers significant insights into the desires and needs of consumers.\" Platform A is AOL's display advertising business, which include advertising networks Advertising.com and buy.at as well as adserving business Adtech. Joanna Shields, the Bebo president, added: \"AOL understands the shifting dynamics of the web and has clearly demonstrated its commitment to leveraging the ever-increasing power of social networks. \"With one and the same vision in this area, it was a natural progression for Bebo to join AOL, and we look forward to working together to continue to expand the online social experience globally.\" Following the takeover, Shields will continue to run Bebo and will report to Ron Grant, AOL's president and chief operating officer. Google bought a 5% stake in AOL in December 2005 for $1bn. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857.
