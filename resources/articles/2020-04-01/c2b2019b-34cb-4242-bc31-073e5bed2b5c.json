On the east coast, New York\u2019s Governor Andrew Cuomo announced several north-east states would work together on determining when to reopen the economy. Cuomo said each of the six states would participate in a working group to make decisions on how and when stay-at-home orders can be relaxed without jeopardizing public health. Meanwhile the governors of California, Oregon and Washington announced a similar project for the west coast. The governors made separate announcements just hours after Donald Trump said on Twitter that it was his decision to decide when to \u201copen up the states\u201d, a claim that has been contradicted by constitutional experts. The governors did not announce specific plans on how to scale back stay-at-home orders or reopen businesses. Instead, both groups said they would coordinate those decisions while first considering the health of residents. Cuomo said the state governments\u2019 decisions about how to reopen the economy would be \u201cguided by experts, data and science\u201d and would not be done \u201cin a political way\u201d. \u201cLet\u2019s be smart, let\u2019s be cooperative and let\u2019s learn from each other,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cThe house is still on fire. We still have to put the fire out, but we do have to begin putting in the pieces of the puzzle that we know we\u2019re going to need \u2026 to make sure this doesn\u2019t reignite,\u201d said Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey. Rhode Island\u2019s Governor Gina Raimondo added: \u201cThe reality is, this virus doesn\u2019t care about state borders, and our response shouldn\u2019t either.\u201d On the west coast, the governors of California, Oregon and Washington \u2013 together home to more than 50 million people \u2013 announced a similar \u201cwestern states pact\u201d that would rely on a shared approach to reopening their economies and containing the virus\u2019s spread. In a joint statement on Monday, Gavin Newsom, Kate Brown and Jay Inslee, respectively the governors of California, Oregon and Washington, said that while each state is building a state-specific plan, the three states have agreed to a framework that focuses on working together, putting their residents\u2019 health first, and relying on health outcomes and science to guide their decisions. \u201cCovid-19 has preyed upon our interconnectedness. In the coming weeks, the west coast will flip the script on Covid-19 \u2013 with our states acting in close coordination and collaboration to ensure the virus can never spread wildly in our communities,\u201d the statement said. States will base decisions on data reports from infections and hospitalizations, among other measures. It is too early to provide a timeline for when restrictions should be lifted, Newsom told a press conference on Monday, but the governor said details on a \u201cbottom-up plan\u201d should be released on Tuesday. Newsom said it was crucial for California to take a regional approach to lifting shelter-in-place orders. \u201cYou can\u2019t build walls around it and you can\u2019t deny fundamental facts,\u201d he said of the virus. The talks to reopen come as New York\u2019s coronavirus death toll surpassed 10,000. An additional 671 New Yorkers died of the virus yesterday, bringing the state\u2019s total death toll to 10,056. But Cuomo said that a plateauing of hospitalizations suggests \u201cthe worst\u201d is over in New York. Meanwhile the number of coronavirus cases in California appears to have slowed. Admissions to ICUs in California ticked up by 2.9% over the weekend, a modest rise compared with days past. By all accounts, stay-at-home orders appeared to have worked, Newsom said.
