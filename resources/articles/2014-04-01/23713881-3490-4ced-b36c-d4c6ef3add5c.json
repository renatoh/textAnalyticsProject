The minister of state for disabled people, Mike Penning, has written to every professional club reminding them of their obligations under law to provide adequate space for disabled supporters, after a survey revealed that only Swansea, Cardiff and Southampton provided enough space for spectators in wheelchairs. The number of wheelchair spaces a stadium should provide is based on its capacity. The Accessible Stadia guide \u2013 published in 2003 in conjunction with the Football Association, Premier League, Football League and Sport England \u2013 states newly constructed grounds that have a capacity between 20,000 and 40,000 must have a minimum 150 wheelchair spaces, rising by three for every 1,000 seats above the 20,000 threshold. If the stadium has a capacity of more than 40,000, at least 210 wheelchair spaces should be made available. A report conducted by the charity Level Playing Field and the BBC calculated the percentage that each Premier League club is fulfilling that criteria by. Fulham were bottom of the list having only made 24% of their required wheelchair capacity available to disabled people, while Tottenham, Aston Villa, Crystal Palace, Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea and Norwich all fell below the 50% mark. Arsenal's Emirates Stadium fulfilled 96% of its wheelchair requirements, with Manchester City's Etihad Stadium 88%. Penning said: \"We need a complete overhaul of grounds and of how disabled fans are supported at every level of the sport \u2013 and that should start at the very top. The situation is currently woefully inadequate and it is not only wheelchair access that falls short, but access for people with all kinds of impairments. Changes must be made now.\" Joyce Cook, the chair of Level Playing Field, added: \"The experience of disabled football fans varies across the country. It can be hard to get tickets, especially for away games and if you're a wheelchair user. And when you get there, the sight lines can be so bad they would have got a better experience watching it on TV. That's not acceptable and it's time all football clubs took their legal obligations seriously.\" Since the Equality Act in 2010 it has been illegal for service providers, including football clubs, to treat disabled people less favourably than other customers. However, a number of Premier League clubs would argue that the antiquated state of their stadiums restricts them from providing more space for wheelchair-bound spectators. A Chelsea spokesman said: \"Like many other clubs with older grounds we are hampered with the age and layout of Stamford Bridge. The provision of disabled spectator viewing is something we take extremely seriously. We have engaged architects to look at the facilities currently available to those fans to determine whether they can be increased and or improved.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
