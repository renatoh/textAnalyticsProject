Downloaders, you have been warned. Grossout of the week #2 A crack-addled Phil Mitchell bumping uglies in EastEnders. Proper gross. Naughty but amusing festival behaviour of the week Madness apparently locked Calvin Harris in a chemical toilet and shook it about a bit at Camp Bestival. Guess it was acceptable in the 80s. Indie TV moment of the week #1 Corrie's Sophie and Sian snuck out to a festival last week to watch Vampire Weekend. Wonder if they were drinking horchata? Indie TV moment of the week #2 Monday's One Tree Hill episode is named after a Wolf Parade album track. Edgy! Brasseye-style TV show of the week The Investigation Discovery Channel in the US is planning two new prison-based reality shows: Talent Behind Bars and Dancing Behind Bars. Cameo of the week Andrew Garfield pops up in Terry Gilliam's Arcade Fire mini-film to control musical androids Win and Regine. Go, spidey! Best new Andre 3000 track of the week I Do is a lush orchestral jam about growing up and stuff. Welcome back, Andre. twitter.com/guideguardian guardianguide.tumblr.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
