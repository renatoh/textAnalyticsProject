So when the 21-year-old was handed a fourth start of the season following a muscle strain to the New Zealander, Clegg grabbed it with both hands with an outstanding display in wretched conditions in Twickenham. \"Rory lives in Nick Evans's pocket. It reminds me of Johnny Sexton and Felipe Contepomi at Leinster, one learning from the other,\" said Conor O'Shea, Harlequins' director of rugby. \"Rory has to be patient but he is the best passer of the ball I've ever seen. He can control a game and kick goals and you can't ask more from a fly-half.\" The All Black Evans will almost certainly return for the trip to London Irish on Saturday but the performance of Clegg, who kicked 11 points, was a bonus for Harlequins in an otherwise unmemorable match, Quins' 10th victory in 11 games. Bloodgate is a distant memory here and the club can secure a place in the Heineken Cup, where the scandal began almost two years ago against Contepomi's Leinster. Clegg was partnered at half-back by Danny Care, given dispensation by Martin Johnson to turn out for his club this weekend. Care slogged away in the mud for 80 minutes while Andrew Sheridan played for 71 in the Sale front row. \"Cleggy was outstanding as like me he didn't realise he was playing until the day before. It was good to get some game time and we really had to step up our defensive effort out there as Sale have got some really big ball-carriers,\" said Care, who will be on England's bench for the game against France across the road on Saturday evening. Quins will miss him in the next month as his stand-in Karl Dickson dislocated his shoulder in the defeat at Exeter and may miss the rest of the season. Sheridan is fit to join Care in the England squad after missing the Italy game with a back spasm. \"He'll be fine. Andrew was never going to finish the game but Martin Johnson had asked us during the week to give him a run-out,\" said Sale's coach, Pete Angelsea. O'Shea, mindful that professional rugby can be too serious a business, recently ordered his players to perform some comedy routines at a Richmond pub to let their hair down. The Stoop certainly seems a jollier place than in the reign of Dean Richards and tries by the young hooker Joe Gray and Mike Brown in the first 16 minutes ensured Quins had the last laugh here.
