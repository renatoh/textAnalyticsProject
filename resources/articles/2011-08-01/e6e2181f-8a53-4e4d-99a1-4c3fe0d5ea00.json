He was too casually dressed to be a lawyer. A rioter, perhaps? Too old, surely. He explained with a sigh. \"In this country, they fuck you both ways if you're a parent. My father was a solicitor and he would beat me properly if I did wrong. Here, if you touch a child, they call social services. They tell you to let children grow up without respect, but when they throw one stone the police turn round and put them in prison.\" He did not cry, but his voice cracked and face crumpled. His son's A-level results had come out that day and it looked as if he had won a place at university. He had thousands of pounds for surety for bail and hoped it would be enough to get the boy out. His son stood among a group of five young men locked in a dock that was enclosed from floor to ceiling by toughened glass. The prosecution alleged that they had left a mosque and joined a group of rioters who had smashed up a cafe, terrified its customers and staff and shouted: \"Fuck off feds\" when the police moved in. They had been in jail for more than a week. A couple had previous convictions, but my companion's son had no criminal record. He had worked hard at school and been on the Duke of Edinburgh's Award scheme. As far as the law was concerned, his good name remained intact, but the bench did not care. The court sent him back to prison and ordered him to stay there for another two weeks. The story is the same across Britain. Of the 1,375 alleged rioters who had appeared in court by Friday lunchtime, magistrates had remanded about 60% into custody when normally they would imprison 10%. Many who pleaded guilty in the hope of the traditional lenient sentence lost their illusions when the courts imprisoned them. By the end of the police investigation, the National Association of Probation Officers estimates that the criminal justice system will have processed 3,300 defendants and jailed 1,700, leaving the prisons with only 200 empty places. Nervous governors know that one riot in one jail will take out the system's spare capacity. Britain has not seen mass arrests and mass incarceration on this scale since the miners' strike of 1984-85. True to form, pundits no event can ever shock into changing their minds have conducted a dialogue of the deaf (and the dumb) as they split between those who blame disorder on poverty and those who blame it on loose morals. To an extent that its critics do not realise, the Cameron/Clegg government is equally cocksure. For all the tough rhetoric of the past fortnight, it has had a relatively soft law-and-order policy. Liberal Democrats have favoured liberalism, naturally. Meanwhile, in opposition and government, Conservatives have been better defenders of civil liberties than their Labour opponents ever were. Most Tories may not have favoured reducing police and prison numbers on political grounds, but they have accepted the financial case that they must cut to save money. The coalition did not expect street violence on this scale, nor, for that matter, did your humble correspondent. Now the police have been overwhelmed and the prison system and courts clogged with alleged offenders, Conservatives are announcing in public that riots are \"Cameron's 9/11\" \u2013 a moment from which there can be no turning back. In private, they are far less certain that their government has made a decisive break with the past. They wonder if Theresa May's plans for curfews will get through Parliament. They say that the Liberal Democrats will not accept draconian measures to strip offenders of benefits and that Iain Duncan Smith was winning support for his wider proposals to make unemployment benefit conditional on claimants trying to find work long before the trouble began. There is no reason to panic if the prisons bulge to bursting, they continue. Ministers can let the ring-fenced NHS budget take the strain by moving mentally ill prisoners into secure hospitals (which government ought to have done years ago anyway) and deporting foreign inmates. As for the proposed cuts in the prison, courts and police budgets, they can go ahead as if nothing has happened. Or as one leading Conservative thinker put it to me: \"There's been a lot of furious rhetoric since the riots but no transformation in government policy.\" If they read more history, ministers would notice one glaring change, however. The mass arrests of the miners' strike of the 1980s occurred against a background of economic decline in Scotland, Wales and the north of England. But not all of Britain was suffering. As in the 1930s, a majority of the population saw real incomes rise. The Conservatives of the Thatcher era could say that they were leading Britain to prosperity. Their successors cannot say the same. Today's violence has come early in a long period of economic decline. Most of the cuts, which will destroy youth services in the inner cities, have yet to bite. One million young people are on the dole already and their numbers will only grow. Those in low-paid work face continuous attacks on their living standards. Meanwhile, the judiciary has made it clear that it will not help cost-cutting ministers by diverting offenders from jail. Readers who think that judges are going through a temporary spasm after the riots should look at the punishments they gave Charlie Gilmour and the student protesters. Whether they are presented with the spoilt children of the rich or poor looters, the judges are sending them down, to the evident approval of the public. If crime increases as the stagnation drags on, it is reasonable to guess that they will be equally hard on common criminals. The distraught gentleman, who wondered about a country that was so permissive one minute and so authoritarian the next, is not the only one who looks confused. A cabinet from the home counties, dominated by naive men and women of the upper and upper-middle class, is carrying on as before: weakening the criminal justice system and ignoring the plight of the urban young. Nothing can shake it out of its rut. \"When the facts change, I change my mind,\" said Lord Keynes. This government does not."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
