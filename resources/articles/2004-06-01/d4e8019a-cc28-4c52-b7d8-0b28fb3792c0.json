Eusebio said he picked up a few tips from the Soviet goalkeeper about saving spot-kicks and passed them on to Portugal's Ricardo. And the secret from beyond the grave? \"I quickly told him [Ricardo] to guess which side the ball was going to go. If you guess right there is then a 70% chance you will save it.\" Helder Postiga's equaliser and cheeky penalty against England have made him the focus of a new advert by a hamburger company. The ads show the Tottenham striker eating French fries with the caption: \"Well done Helder. The potatoes always taste better after you have eaten the beef.\" In Portugal the English are known as \"bifes\" (beefs). Michel Platini says France's lack of technique led to the champions' exit. \"France did not surprise me. They played exactly as they did [in the World Cup] in 2002, with Zin\u00e9dine Zidane and luck on top of that,\" the former captain said. Stelios Giannakopoulos says he will be fit for Greece's semi-final on Thursday. \"Tomorrow I will start playing with the team for the whole [training] session and I will be ready for the game,\" the injured midfielder said yesterday. The Dutch defender Frank de Boer looks likely to miss the rest of Euro 2004 after injuring an ankle against Sweden. \"It has been getting worse from the moment I was substituted,\" he said. The Holland defender Michael Reiziger claims talks with Middlesbrough continue and that he expects to play in the Premiership next season. \"I am negotiating with Middlesbrough. The negotiations are going well,\" he said. Uefa has confirmed that Dmitry Kirichenko's goal after 67 seconds in Russia's 2-1 win over Greece was the fastest in tournament history. \"Doing an Aston Villa\" is becoming a Portuguese term for missing a penalty, after spot-kick gaffes by England's Darius Vassell and Sweden's Olof Mellberg, team-mates at the midlands club. \"Mellberg does an Aston Villa\" was the headline in the sports paper Record."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
