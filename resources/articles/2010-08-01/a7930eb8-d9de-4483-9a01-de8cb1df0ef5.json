We have both recently had babies and live in the same street. While we didn't get on madly well before, I have really tried as I always wanted a sister. But since having children, which I hoped would bring us closer, I dread seeing her. She is really competitive, and after I've left her I feel drained and bad about myself. She makes comments that are quite bitchy and make me defensive. Everything she has is better: her highchair is better because she researched highchairs; her car seat is better because she researched it. She is always quoting safety regulations at me (she used to work for the Trading Standards Institute). I feel sad for the relationship we could have had. What can I do? MD, St Albans What a cauldron of emotions going on here. You wanted her to be like a sister but you probably hate her for marrying your brother; she probably hates you for having a great relationship with her husband, your brother. She may or may not have wanted to end up living in the same street as you, but your brother probably wanted to, which makes her (probably) hate you more. Plus, she worked in a job that involved very exacting parameters \u2013 now she has no outlet and no one is interested in her research (couldn't she start a blog?). This is heated enough, but when you add babies into the mix, which brings out the maddest in all of us, well, I'm surprised you're even still talking to each other. I feel for you. I know people like this and avoid them if possible. Joy suckers, my friend calls them. But I also feel for your sister-in-law. She sounds a lot like me. In my job, I'm always finding out about lots of new research that renders what was regarded as safe just seven days ago a positive danger this week. It's amazing I still have friends. You also don't say how long it is since they were married \u2013 I would guess not long. You have also both not long had babies. Give it all time. In a few months/years, you really could end up being good friends and a source of great comfort to one another as you rant against your menfolk. In the meantime, you can do one of three things: carry on as you are, growing in your resentment of each other; talk to her about it; or slowly cut off contact. The latter isn't really an option as I'm presuming you get on very well with your younger brother. So let's look at the other two. It's sometimes easier to simmer over someone than be proactive in changing the way you interact with them, but this is an important relationship. You need to work at fixing it. When I say talk to her about it, you can talk to her straight \u2013 \"we don't seem to be getting on\" \u2013 but this may seem heavy. Or, if you genuinely suspect her of being bitchy, you can pull her up on individual statements and make it clear you won't tolerate them. For example, if she says something such as \"Do you use that car seat? It's really not regarded as safe,\" then you gently reply, \"Did you mean that to sound as bitchy/judgmental/rude as it sounds?\" This has excellent results, but if you're not careful it can sound aggressive. But it certainly pulls up people who are \"bitchy under the radar\". Lastly, bear in mind that she may genuinely be trying to be helpful \u2013 at the very least she is trying to impress you, and you need to ask yourself why that might be. I appreciate it can be hard to take unsolicited advice, especially if it's seen as a criticism, but is her research any good? Because if it is, it seems that you have a valuable source of information there, and you need to question why it rankles you so to receive it. In order to help both of you, why not try a different tack? Next time you need to buy something, just ask her. Say \"I'm thinking of buying an XYZ. What would you recommend?\" You may both be surprised at the results."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
