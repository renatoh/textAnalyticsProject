The former BBC journalist Linden Kemkaran, who is standing for the Conservatives in Labour-held Bradford East, retweeted a user on Twitter last week who dismissed Islamophobia as nonsense \u2013 describing it as a \u201ccrock\u201d. She retweeted two others who accused the shadow minister for women and equalities, Naz Shah, who is standing in the neighbouring constituency, of being \u201cnot white enough\u201d to have experienced Bradford\u2019s \u201cno-go areas\u201d and claimed that the prospective MP\u2019s loyalties did not lie in the city. Kemkaran also liked a post labelling Shah \u2013 who is British-born and of Pakistani heritage \u2013 a \u201cPakideshi\u201d who pushes the \u201cdoggy-do-do Muslim narrative\u201d. It comes after the Conservative party chairman, James Cleverly, apologised on Sunday after a string of allegations of Islamophobia and racism against the party\u2019s candidates. The Guardian revealed on Friday that at least four ministers had gone on election campaigning trips to endorse Tory candidates accused of anti-Muslim hatred. Kemkaran \u2013 who has been pictured with Boris Johnson \u2013 became embroiled in a row with Shah after the shadow minister accused her of using \u201cfar-right language\u201d, claiming she told young people at a hustings last Thursday that the city had \u201ccrime-infested streets\u201d and \u201cno-go areas\u201d. In response, Kemkaran retweeted a user \u2013 whose Twitter biography reads \u201cNo to that cult, Islam\u201d \u2013 who sent a message to Shah saying: \u201cYou are a dunce. There weren\u2019t any no-go areas when I was a kid. Muslims always the victims, play race card, \u2018Islamophobia\u2019, what a crock, what a nasty culture. No integration, what makes you think we will accept 3rd world ways and why should we?\u201d She also retweeted another user who messaged Shah saying: \u201cWe know where your loyalties lie, and it\u2019s not Bradford.\u201d She retweeted a third user who accused Shah of being \u201cnot white enough\u201d to have experienced Bradford\u2019s \u201cno-go areas\u201d. He wrote: \u201cI worked in Bradford for two years Naz, there is some truth in what Linden said. If you\u2019ve not experienced it, that may be because your face is not white enough.\u201d Kemkaran, who is fighting to overturn Labour\u2019s 20,500 majority, has since retracted the posts. The Tory candidate liked a tweet from a user who replied to Shah\u2019s criticism of Kemkaran\u2019s comments abouts \u201cno-go areas\u201d in Bradford, writing: \u201cPushing the doggy do do Muslim narrative again. Another Pakideshi [who just happens to support rape gangs] pushing her lies via the race card. Truth hurts. There are \u2018no go\u2019 areas in #Bradford, crime is 50% above the average \u2013 not forgetting their other cultural delights, FGM.\u201d She also liked another tweet by a user who claimed that she was not able to view a house because the sellers required a \u201csharia mortgage\u201d. After Shah pointed out on Twitter Kemkaran\u2019s retweeting of the post that declared Islamophobia to be \u201ccrock\u201d, the Tory candidate replied accusing her of shutting down debate. She wrote: \u201cPlease @NazShahBfd don\u2019t bother trying to shut me up by crying \u2018Islamophobia\u2019, or calling me a racist. Neither is true. I\u2019m standing up for the diverse people of #Bradford who are telling me how it is. You should be listening to people not trying to shut down debate.\u201d Shah, who has a 20,000 majority in Bradford West, has previously been at the centre of her own controversy concerning social media posts. The Labour politician liked and retweeted a post in 2017 that said: \u201cThose abused girls in Rotherham and elsewhere just need to shut their mouths. For the good of diversity.\u201d Shah subsequently claimed it had been a mistake. In 2016, Shah was suspended after antisemitic posts she had made emerged. She was later readmitted and made shadow minister for women and equalities. On Monday afternoon, Shah submitted an official complaint to Cleverly, calling on the Conservatives to suspend Kemkaran immediately and conduct a full investigation. In a letter to the Tory party chairman, Shah wrote: \u201cTo peddle these far-right tropes \u2013 especially an individual standing for office \u2013 is not only irresponsible, but hugely dangerous for minority communities \u2026 I do not believe it is fit for a parliamentary candidate to retweet a message, victim-blaming Muslims, suggesting attacks on them are nonsense, whilst almost half of all religious hate crime offences in 2018-19 were targeted against Muslims (according to the Home Office); or to assert that Muslims have a \u2018nasty culture\u2019.\u201d Kemkaran spent six years working for BBC News as a news planner, defence and security producer and reporter, according to her LinkedIn profile. She came under fire earlier this month when she compared anti-Tory abuse to the discrimination endured by minorities. The candidate responded to a tweet suggesting \u201ccoming out\u201d as a Tory is \u201calmost worse than coming out as gay in modern western society\u201d by writing: \u201cI made this EXACT point on Facebook last week. If you substitute the word Tory with gay/black/trans, the abuse that is heaped on us is eerily similar to the bad old days of discrimination, bigotry &amp; intolerance.\u201d She later told PinkNews that as \u201ca woman of colour and Conservative\u201d, she experienced \u201cyears of racist abuse and violence, mostly when at school and in my teenage years\u201d. In July, she wrote a piece for the Spectator highlighting how she received \u201cranting vitriol\u201d from friends on Facebook after she posted a selfie with Boris Johnson. The Conservatives, whose leader Johnson claims the party has a zero-tolerance policy on Islamophobia, said an investigation was under way. A spokeswoman said: \u201cThis matter is being investigated. Discrimination or abuse of any kind is wrong, and the Conservative party takes decisive action to deal with any incidents of hatred, abuse or intimidation. \u201cOur complaints process is rightly a confidential one but there are a wide range of sanctions to challenge and change behaviour, including conditions to undertake training, periods of suspension and expulsion, and these are applied on a case-by-case basis.\u201d Kemkaran has been approached for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
