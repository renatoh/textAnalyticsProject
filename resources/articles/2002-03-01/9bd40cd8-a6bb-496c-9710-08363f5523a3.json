I don't know whether Richard Scudamore, the chief executive of the Premier League, will attend but if he does he will no doubt reflect on a job well done. The Premier League, aided and abetted by the Football Association, has ensured that, rather than being able to scrutinise clubs and monitor relations with fans, the IFC will be nothing more than a toothless body with good intentions. To explain this it is necessary to go back a few years. Remember the Football Task Force? Set up by the newly elected government in 1997, it was to look into the running of football. Chaired by David Mellor, it had representatives from the Premier League, FA and supporters' organisations, and independent members. Over two years recommendations were submitted on racism, disabled access and community work. Their final report on commercial issues (ticket pricing, merchandising, PLCs) also considered supporter involvement in the running of clubs and the overall governance of the game. Here the task force disagreed. The majority report proposed measures to increase the influence of fans and crucially called for an independent Football Audit Commission to oversee the running of the game, with an \"ombudsfan\" to deal with complaints. The FA and Premier League unsurprisingly preferred a watered-down, self-regulatory system. The report landed on secretary of state Chris Smith's desk in December 1999 and 10 months later he announced the government's support for self-regulation. What held up the announcement was not discussion on the merits of the report but political intrigue as to who would be chairman. Jack Cunningham MP had been offered the job by Downing Street and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport was told to \"sort it\". Advisers at No10 thought this was the ideal way to reward him for his loyalty, but others did not. The Football Supporters Association, the National Federation of Supporters Organisations and fanzines opposed his appointment because of his links to Newcastle United's board. Downing Street gave in and the job was advertised, with the shortlist drawn up by two independent assessors, a senior official from the DCMS and Scudamore. My arguments for a supporters' representative to be involved were rejected. The football authorities also wasted money on headhunters who simply produced a list of company chairmen. Celebrities were approached, some with limited interest in football, others with knowledge only of corporate boxes. There was one person eminently suitable, respected by supporters and clubs alike. Sir John Smith, the former deputy commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, had been an independent member of the Task Force and was the author of the FA-commissioned \"bung inquiry\" report. Unfortunately he supported the majority report, which effectively marked his card with Scudamore, who set out to prevent him being interviewed by threatening that if Sir John was chosen the football authorities would abandon the IFC proposal. The threats were met with delay and more delay. I found it astonishing that Scudamore was allowed to dictate terms. Civil servants were unwilling to upset Downing Street by upsetting football. The election took place, new ministers came in and Sir John, although finally interviewed, was not appointed. I have nothing against the chairman, Derek Fraser, vice-chancellor of Teesside University. He wants a successful IFC but the body's remit and scope merely to receive reports from the FA and Premier League is concerning. It has no power to tackle wrongdoing or make demands on clubs. At least it is based in Teesside and not FA headquarters but football is still the financier. The membership lacks anyone associated with fans or who has raised concerns about how football is run. Rogan Taylor and Dr Adam Brown, well known for their research on fan issues, were both excluded. Rigorous scrutiny of football is needed more than ever with the huge sums of money involved. Self-regulation can work only if there is genuine desire to make it work. Football has shown that it doesn't want rigorous scrutiny, especially from those who might have awkward questions. It's a pity that it has taken five years to prove this. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
