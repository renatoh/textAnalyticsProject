The European champions, who are bracketed among the top eight seeds, would normally have avoided playing another Premiership club at this stage but lost that right when finishing outside the top four in the league last season and had to start the current Champions League campaign in the first qualifying round. However Liverpool will be keen to avoid Chelsea, despite eliminating them at the semi-final stage last spring. They lost three out of five games against the Premiership champions last season, including in the Carling Cup final, and Rafael Ben\u00edtez is certain to prefer to be paired with PSV Eindhoven or Lyon, who are also in the second pot. The alternatives for Chelsea - if they do not draw Liverpool - look less appealing: Milan, Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich are all potential opponents. Liverpool could also face city rivals Everton, should David Moyes's side have come through the third qualifying round last night, but cannot play Manchester United or Arsenal as they are also in the first seeding group. There are several potentially tricky teams among the third and fourth seeding and the English contingent will be hoping to avoid teams such as Real Betis, who finished fourth in La Liga last season, the Bundesliga runners-up Schalke 04 and the Serie A side Udinese. Olympiakos, Lille, Benfica and Sparta Prague are also in today's draw together with Champions League debutants Artmedia Bratislava, who have already eliminated Celtic and Partizan Belgrade in their two qualifying rounds. Another team making their first appearance is Thun, the Swiss town with a population of 40,000 who on Tuesday night saw their team qualify for the group stage with a 4-0 aggregate win over Malmo."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
