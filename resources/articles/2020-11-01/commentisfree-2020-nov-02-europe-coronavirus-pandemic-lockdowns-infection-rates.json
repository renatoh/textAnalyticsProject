The UK is not exempt, and England will enter a new lockdown from Thursday 5 November. From the outside, it might seem the continent is in the grip of a second wave that is ramping rapidly towards its peak. But it is not one wave, it\u2019s many local waves, and that is crucial in understanding how to rein it in and prevent the same thing happening again. Though there is some tentative evidence that the virus itself has undergone a change since the summer, there is none to suggest that this change has affected either the transmissibility or the severity of the disease. Nor can the change explain the synchronous surges in all parts of the continent. Experts believe that synchronicity is explained mainly by similarities in public health strategies, driven by a shared news space \u2013 the fact, for instance, that countries lifted their first lockdowns at roughly the same time, and that schools have been open across Europe since the beginning of this academic year \u2013 and also, perhaps, by a spell of cold weather at the end of September. The American public health expert Anthony Fauci said recently that the United States was still grappling with the first wave of the pandemic, and the same could be said of Europe. European nations just dented it more profoundly in the spring. The view of health experts now is that, for various reasons, Europe\u2019s strategy for exiting its spring lockdowns failed. Either politicians ignored their advice, or the systems weren\u2019t in place to implement it correctly. People\u2019s goodwill and trust leached away as the pandemic dragged on, and when those experts started calling for stronger measures again this autumn \u2013 and the same exit strategy as before \u2013 politicians were even less willing to listen. The fault is not only the politicians\u2019. Some governments may have done better than others in managing their epidemics, but all of them are trying to satisfy as many of their voters as possible \u2013 and of course, to stay in power. The misunderstandings that have landed us in this new chapter of misery belong to all of us. There are really only two of them, but they have done a lot of damage: an inability to grasp the notion of exponentiality, and the dangerous idea that you can simultaneously save lives and spare the economy. An outbreak of Covid-19, if unchecked, grows exponentially or explosively \u2013 meaning it can be growing quietly before it suddenly appears to be out of control, and that it is always better to stop it as early as possible. Analyses of past pandemics, as well as economists\u2019 assessments of this one \u2013 including a report published last month by the International Monetary Fund \u2013 all say the same thing: the cities, regions or countries that came down hard and early on the virus not only lost the fewest lives, they were also the most resistant economically. What does this mean going forward? Public health experts agree that the first lockdown \u2013 as blunt or blanket as it was \u2013 was essential. Europe, like the rest of the world, was short on knowledge and equipment and needed to buy itself time. In most countries, those lockdowns drove infection rates down, but not as low a level as the experts would have liked. The virus was still circulating when they were lifted \u2013 that is, there was still community transmission \u2013 making fresh outbreaks inevitable. The optimal strategy for the next phase was therefore to impose precise, local lockdowns when those outbreaks were detected. This meant having an effective test and trace system in place, to find the outbreak, followed by a coordinated set of measures \u2013 such as restrictions on travel in and out, social distancing measures, protection of key workers \u2013 imposed locally to stamp it out. Importantly, support could be channelled to affected areas in a more targeted way, reducing the financial burden on the state. The failure of this strategy wasn\u2019t noticeable at first. Many of us enjoyed a relatively carefree summer. And yet infection rates were rising \u2013 not steadily, as the cliche goes, but exponentially. The return to school, university and work amplified the spread in September, and by October hospitals were sounding the alarm. Experts had been calling for stronger measures, including increased protection for the most vulnerable, for weeks by then, but they had largely been ignored. Fatigue had set in. \u201cIf the politicians didn\u2019t want to act then, it wasn\u2019t because they hadn\u2019t understood the situation, it was because they were convinced that French people weren\u2019t ready to hear difficult messages,\u201d says the epidemiologist and member of the French government\u2019s scientific advisory council Arnaud Fontanet. The council had been accused of being alarmist in early September, and a petition had even circulated demanding its resignation. In Belgium, which has one of the highest infection rates in Europe at the moment, the virologist and government adviser Marc Van Ranst pointed to Germany\u2019s partial lockdown in a tweet on 29 October, commenting: \u201cWe could and should have done this six weeks ago.\u201d Trends are worrying across the continent now, including in countries such as Greece and the Czech Republic, where infection rates had been low until recently. Measures are tightening up everywhere. They differ from country to country, not only because the local context differs, but also because there is disagreement about what this next phase should achieve. Some scientists argue the new lockdowns must eliminate community transmission entirely before the exit strategy is implemented; others say that it\u2019s sufficient to drive infection rates down by a smaller margin and the exit strategy will finish the job, allowing economies to breathe sooner. The devil, as always, is in the detail. But the good news is that we\u2019re better placed to implement that exit strategy now than in the spring. Testing rates vary but are pretty high across the continent. Contact tracing is better, though not as good as it could be. It\u2019s mostly forward looking, designed to locate people who have been exposed to an infected person. We need more of the type that tracks backwards from that person to identify an outbreak\u2019s source. Care has improved, hospitals are better equipped. Most of us have incorporated social distancing into our routines. But \u2013 and it\u2019s a big but \u2013 people are tired, poorer than they were a year ago and fed up. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important that governments explain clearly why this exit strategy is the only feasible one \u2013 pointing to the countries large and small, rich and poor, island and not, that have pulled it off: Australia, Taiwan, Vietnam, New Zealand, South Korea, China. It\u2019s also why everyone needs to get to grips with exponentiality, and with the idea that sparing the economy is a false economy. We have to contain the virus. All the alternatives are worse. \u2022 Laura Spinney is a science journalist and author.
