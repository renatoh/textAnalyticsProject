On TV and radio Gove seemed very proud of his record as education secretary. One of his favourite words at the time was \u201crigour\u201d. I thought there was \u201crigour\u201d missing in how Gove was treated during his interviews: I didn\u2019t hear anyone ask him why he was sacked as education secretary (it was because he was considered a \u201ctoxic liability\u201d). Meanwhile, you must have been outraged, surely, by something your other colleague Jeremy Hunt, who beat Gove in the voting, said in the debate: 25% of primary school leavers are unable to read, he said. What a shock. All state primary school leavers have been taught to read according to the strict methods prescribed by Michael Gove and Nick Gibb. If Hunt is right, they are a terrible indictment of your own party\u2019s favoured methods and record in government. Did you and Mr Gibb write to Mr Hunt to ask him for clarification on this matter or, if you thought it was an error, to ask him to withdraw it? It is of course a nonsense that 25% of primary school children leave unable to read and this shows how schools, teachers and education are used by politicians at election time as a punch ball. Politicians say what they want and get away with it. Even so, as secretary of state for education, you must have been desperate to set the record straight. Perhaps I can help. In the early stages of bringing in systematic, synthetic phonics for teaching children to read, people in charge were scrupulous in separating the ideas of \u201cdecoding\u201d and \u201creading\u201d. Phonics, they said, taught children how to \u201cdecode\u201d writing: that is, to learn the \u201calphabetic principle\u201d, while \u201creading\u201d was used to describe reading for meaning. Your predecessors invented a test \u2013 the phonics screening check \u2013 to assess how well children were learning to decode. This isn\u2019t a reading test because clearly it doesn\u2019t test whether the children have understood anything. \u201cThe check focuses solely on decoding,\u201d [pdf] the ministers said. At the end of primary school, the children have a reading test. They read a passage and answer right/wrong questions on it. These questions are about \u201cretrieval, inference, chronology and presentation\u201d which, it is claimed, show whether children understand what they read. You\u2019ll know, of course, that children are scoring in the 90s for the decoding test, but when those same children are tested five years later for reading they are reaching the \u201cexpected level\u201d of around 75%. This is where Hunt got confused. He thinks that 25% not being at the expected level is the same as saying they are \u201cunable to read\u201d. This is certainly not true. Nigh on every child can \u201cdecode\u201d by age five or six, yet when the same children are 10 or 11, some of the decoders don\u2019t understand what they\u2019re reading. How does that happen? You don\u2019t suppose it is because we are not spending enough time in primary schools enjoying real books and chatting about them because we are too busy preparing for the tests politicians impose and then misrepresent? Incidentally, I thought of a great history lesson on democracy. Pupils could compare proportions: the tiny percentage of the population who could vote before the first reform bill of 1832 and the tiny percentage who could vote for a new PM. Just a thought.
