Bye! Here\u2019s Nick Ames\u2019 match report from the Emirates: For 54 minutes it was tempting to wonder whether this low-key encounter, watched by a sparse attendance and trundling along nicely enough in Arsenal\u2019s favour, might one day go down in history as the night a troubled head coach began clawing his way back from the brink. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang\u2019s goal had left them looking as comfortable as this team ever can, and there was even the good news story of a quiet reintegration for Granit Xhaka, who had performed tidily enough. Then Daichi Kamada struck two bolts from the blue for Eintracht Frankfurt and it is impossible to escape the conclusion that, no matter what Unai Emery tries, his tenure is doomed to fail. Much more here: Unai Emery faces the cameras: Yes, we lost here and for the Europa League we continue. We have the last match to achieve our objective. Today I think we improve. In the first half we deserved to win. The second half, the first five, 10 minutes or so wasn\u2019t good for us. We lost control for 15 minutes and they scored two goals. The first half we controlled all the game. We created chances to score a second goal. The second half as well, for five or 10 minutes was positive. Then we lost control of the game, they pushed and scored two goals. We tried again to come back, but really we didn\u2019t push, we didn\u2019t create a big opportunity to score. We think we deserved more, but we lost control of the game for 15 minutes and they achieved their result in that moment. I am being positive but above all realistic. We lost a very good opportunity to reach the next round tonight. I\u2019m thinking about the next match. I rather missed the complete Rosenbergness of the Malmo match. Here\u2019s the scene before kick-off: He captains the team, and scores twice in an absolute humdinger of a game, including in the winner in the fourth minute of stoppage time: Followed by wild post-game celebrations, curtain-calls and tributes: Malmo v Dynamo Kyiv got the last-minute winner it deserved, incidentally. Markus Rosenberg scored it. It is his last home game for Malmo, ahead of his imminent retirement. Fairytale stuff. All the final scores of tonight\u2019s 8pm kick-offs: Group A Dudelange 0-2 Apoel Nicosia Sevilla 2-0 Qarabag Group B Lugano 0-1 Copenhagen Malmo 4-3 Dynamo Kyiv Group D Rosenborg 1-2 LASK Sporting 4-0 PSV Eindhoven Group E Celtic 3-1 Rennes Lazio 1-0 Cluj Group F Arsenal 1-2 Eintracht Frankfurt Vitoria Guimaraes 1-1 Standard Liege \u201cWe just witnessed an absolute shambles of a performance in the second half,\u201d rages Martin Keown. Boos echo around a largely already-empty Emirates Stadium as the final whistle blows on another Arsenal defeat. Seven games without a win now, and is there any way back from this for Unai Emery? Another European win for Celtic, who are now guaranteed first place in Group E after a comfortable victory over Rennes. 90+2 mins: Guendouzi throws a frustrated elbow into the nearest opponent, and is booked. 90+1 mins: There will be three minutes of stoppage time at Arsenal. Celtic, meanwhile, are playing the last of four advertised minutes. 90 mins: The corner is worked to Saka, whose shot from 20 yards is blocked. 89 mins: The Arsenal fans don\u2019t know whether to boo or leave. Their team is making a late effort, and Willock\u2019s cross is headed behind for a corner. 89 mins: A penalty shout! Saka goes down in the area, but the referee couldn\u2019t be less interested. A consolation for Rennees in Glasgow! It\u2019s a fine cross from the left and a fine run from Hunou, across the defender, and his header flashes in at the near post. 84 mins: Eintracht keep threatening, but they also keep trying to dribble round lots of Arsenal players in the penalty area. If they just hurried up and shot, they might score another yet. 83 mins: Abraham, the Frankfurt captain, goes down for a while in apparent pain. And then he gets up and walks away. His antics earn him some loud booing. 80 mins: Arsenal have basically stopped attacking. Or at least, they\u2019ve stopped shooting. The game is drifting away from them. They just won\u2019t stop scoring at Malmo. Dynamov Kyiv\u2019s Benjamin Verbic has made it 3-3 there now. 76 mins: Mustafi has indeed had to go off, and Torreira has come on to replace him, forcing Xhaka into defence. A team that started with three centre-backs on the pitch now has one. A fine one-two with Ntcham, a great first touch, and a precise low finish across goal from Michael Johnston puts Celtic in a three-goal lead, and they are totally bossing Group E! 69 mins: Nearly a third for Frankfurt! Gacinovic is played in down the left, but Sokratis manages to keep up with him, and get a boot in the way of the shot when it comes. 67 mins: Mustafi required a bit of treatment after that second goal, and it looks like he might have to go off here. That would be Arsenal\u2019s final substitution, and certainly not how Emery would like to use it. Ozil\u2019s arrival hasn\u2019t changed the course of the Gunners game! Mart\u00ednez makes an excellent save, but when the ensuing corner is headed to the edge of the area there are three black shirts there, in all sorts of space. Kamada collects the ball, composes himself, and under no pressure whatsoever sends it arrowing towards the bottom corner! The goals are flying in now across the continent. Erdal Rakip has made it Malmo 3-2 Dynamo Kyiv in what sounds like an absolute belter, Meanwhile Bryan Gil has scored for Sevilla against Qarabag, which is great news for Ciaran. 60 mins: Emery has acted, by taking off Martinelli and bringing on Ozil. 57 mins: The goal has been coming, even if Eintracht hadn\u2019t created many clear chances. They made two changes at half-time, bringing on Kohr and Gacinovic for Fernandes and Andre Silva, and they have dominated the game since the restart. An equaliser! Kamada collects the ball on the edge of the area, on the right-hand side, facing away from goal. He\u2019s allowed to spin, come infield and curl a lovely left-footer inside the far post! 47 mins: Chance for Arsenal! And another chance for Arsenal! Martinelli tees up Willock, whose shot should have gone in but instead went wide, off a defender\u2019s leg. And from the corner Xhaka ghosts past his man and pulls back to Chambers, who wellies his shot way high! The goals just keep coming in Malmo, where Markus Rosenberg, who is presumably on loan from the 2006 World Cup, has equalised for the home side against Dynamo Kyiv. Rosenberg is 37 now. Ciar\u00e1n is at the Ram\u00f3n Sanchez Pijuan for the Sevilla v Qarabag game! And he\u2019s sent in a half-time report. There the good news ends, though: Just in case you\u2019re wondering, there\u2019s absolutely nothing going on. Sevilla, somehow, started the game eight points above second place, and played with an obvious and understandable lack of energy. Chicharito, looking a lot heavier than I remembered him, hasn\u2019t even tested Asmir Begovic in what they\u2019re already calling the battle of former Premier League players. Play is back under way at Celtic. And probably some other places. Not, though, at Arsenal, thanks to all those first-half stoppages. On one hand, the Arsenal match has been very slow-paced and underwhelming. On the other hand, there\u2019s hardly anyone there so on a per-capita basis they\u2019ve surely had more excitement per head than normal. And a report from Feyenoord, where a point was single-handedly won for Rangers by Morelos, more or less: And some half-time reading, firstly a report on Wolves\u2019 ding-dong Braga-based draw: All your half-time scores: Group A Dudelange 0-2 Apoel Nicosia Sevilla 0-0 Qarabag Group B Lugano 0-1 Copenhagen Malmo 1-2 Dynamo Kyiv Group D Rosenborg 1-1 LASK Sporting 3-0 PSV Eindhoven Group E Celtic 2-0 Rennes Lazio 1-0 Cluj Group F Arsenal 1-0 Eintracht Frankfurt Vitoria Guimaraes 1-1 Standard Liege 45+4 mins: They\u2019re playing five minutes of stoppage time at Arsenal, where Xhaka is back on the pitch and skewing a shot wide from the edge of the box. Ryan Christie has doubled Celtic\u2019s lead just before half-time! It\u2019s a decent shot, and it bounces nastily on its way inside the near post from 20 yards or so, but the keeper should absolutely have got a bit of himself in the way of that one. Martinelli slides the ball across the area from the right, and Aubameyang\u2019s shot hits the bottom of a defender\u2019s outstretched leg, and the top of the goalkeeper\u2019s outstretched leg, and then the bottom of the crossbar, and then bounces, and then goes in! A couple of away goals to tell you about: Maxime Lestienne has given Standard Liege a 1-0 lead at Guimaraes, in Arsenal\u2019s group. And Giorgos Merkis makes it Dudelange 0-1 Apoel Nicosia. 43 mins: Another injury at Arsenal, where Xhaka has had lengthy treatment to his right knee. 41 mins: Saka has a chance at the end of a bizarrely slow-paced Arsenal move, but it\u2019s straight at the keeper. It\u2019s all going off in Malmo, where Viktor Tsygankov has given Dynamo Kyiv a 2-1 lead. 34 mins: Martinelli gets a caution for fouling Kostic, who was himself booked a while ago. Consider yourselves up to date on Arsenal-based bookings. 32 mins: David Luiz has played on for a while, but is unable to run off the mysterious injury that mysteriously injured him earlier. He\u2019s off, and Guendouzi is on. 30 mins: Saka is played through, but R\u00f6nnow comes out well to get in the way of the shot. He seems to have hurt his ankle in the process, and the physios are now on. Lazio lead Cluj 1-0, thanks to a goal from Joaquin Correa. Not to be confused with Eddie Izzard, who\u2019s had a joking career. 28 mins: Another chance for Celtic! Ntcham shoots from just outside the area, and aims it expertly for the far post, but the keeper makes a good save. An excellent cut-back, a fine first-time finish and Celtic are in the lead! That was a fine move, filleting the French side down their left flank, and an all-round good goal. Dynamo Kyiv have equalised at Malmo! The young defender Vitaliy Mykolenko has done the scoring. Also, Thomas Goiginger has given LASK a 0-1 advantage at Rosenborg. More goals: Uros Matic has scored from the spot to give Apoel Nicosia a 0-1 lead at Dudelange. And Bruno Fernandes has doubled Sporting\u2019s lead over PSV. 16 mins: Amazing miss/save combo! And then a goalline clearance! Xhaka swings in a corner, and an absolutely bonkers defensive header sends the ball straight to Martinelli, unmarked and six yards out, who\u2019s got a tap-in! He taps straight into the keeper. Another corner, and this time Martinelli heads it at the near post, and it\u2019s headed off the line at the far! Sporting have taken the lead against PSV, through Luiz Phellype. Victory would take the Portuguese side through tonight. David Luiz is currently on the turf, apparently hurt. Watching replays of the incident it\u2019s hard to see how he\u2019s managed to get himself injured, but such is life. He is, interestingly, playing as a midfield anchor tonight. 11 mins: Arsenal nearly score! It\u2019s a lovely cross from the left, and either Willock or Aubameyang had to nod it in at the back stick! But instead of one of them having a free header they mark each other, put each other off, and Aubameyang heads wide. The only goal of the 8pm kick-offs so far has come at Malmo, who have taken a second-minute lead against Dynamo Kyiv through Rasmus Bengtsson. 5 mins: Action at Arsenal, where Unai Emery has been told to take off his black jacket, which combined with his black trousers might lead people to think he\u2019s playing for Eintracht Frankfurt, who are clad all in black. 1 min: Peeeeeep! We\u2019re off! Ruddy Buquet is perhaps my No1 top favourite referee\u2019s name. Not to be confused with this, which is of course a ruddy bouquet. The Emirates is at the very most half full tonight. It\u2019s come to something when fans can\u2019t even be relied on to turn up and boo. The 8pm kick-offs in full: Group A Dudelange v Apoel Nicosia Sevilla v Qarabag Group B Lugano v Copenhagen Malmo v Dynamo Kyiv Group D Rosenborg v LASK Sporting v PSV Eindhoven Group E Celtic v Rennes Lazio v Cluj Group F Arsenal v Eintracht Frankfurt Vitoria Guimaraes v Standard Liege Hello world! No time for shilly-shallying: the players are already coming out at the Emirates, where Granit Xhaka returns to the side for the first time since his post-substitutional strop precisely one month and one day ago. Unai Emery keeps five of the team that drew with Southampton at the weekend, and changes the rest. Arsenal: Martinez, Mustafi, Papastathopoulos, Luiz, Chambers, Willock, Xhaka, Tierney, Martinelli, Aubameyang, Saka. Subs: Leno, Lacazette, Ozil, Torreira, Pepe, Nelson, Guendouzi. Eintracht Frankfurt: Ronnow, Abraham, Hasebe, Hinteregger, Da Costa, Sow, Fernandes, Kostic, Kamada, Paciencia, Andre Silva. Subs: Ndicka, Joveljic, Gacinovic, Toure, Chandler, Kohr, Zimmermann. Referee: Ruddy Buquet (France) Still plenty more matches to come today, including those featuring Arsenal, Celtic and Dudelange. And here comes Simon Burnton to take you through them. So it\u2019s bye from me. Bye! Here are all today\u2019s results so far: Astana 2-1 Manchester United Braga 3-3 Wolves Feyenoord 2-2 Rangers AZ Alkmaar 2-2 Partizan Krasnodor 1-0 Basel Trabzonspor 0-1 Getafe Young Boys 1-2 Porto CSKA 1-1 Ludogorets Oleksandra 0-1 Wolfsburg Ferencvaros 2-2 Espanyol BAsaksehir 0-3 Roma Saint Etienne 0-0 Gent WAC 0-1 Monchengladbach Besiktas 2-1 Slovan Bratislava Young Boys 1-2 Porto Wolves are through to the last 32. But Nuno will be annoyed that they let slip a 3-1 lead here, with this result meaning they remain second in the group behind Braga. Two goals by Morelos means Rangers are top of their group going into the last game, in which they will need to avoid defeat at home to Young Boys. 90 min: Sa\u00efss swings his left foot at the ball from 25 yards. He makes a reasonable connection but it swirls over the bar. 88 min: Braga threaten to hurt Wovles on the counter-attack, but the decisive pass is just too long for Fransergio. Porto are now leading 2-1 against Young Boys, so all four teams could be still in contention going into the last group game. They\u2019ve come back from 3-1 down! And the equaliser is a dreadfully sloppy from a Wolves\u2019 viewpoint. Coady cleared a corner but then a cross came back in from the left and Fransergio was free to nod in from close range. GOAL! Besiktas 1-1 Slovan Bratislava (Roco 76). That means that both Braga and Wolves would go through to the next round, ceteris paribus. 75 min: Marvellous play by Moutinho. He wins the ball in midfield and then flips a sublime pass with the outside of his foot to Neto, who bombs down the right and sends over a delivery .... that comes to nothing. 73 min: Paulinho booked for nearly rugby tackling Traor\u00e9 to the ground, which, in fairness, is no mean feat. Super forward play by another Colombian. Sinisterra sent a bamboozled Helander spinning backwards onto his backside before dinking the ball over the advancing McGregor. Braga pounce on a slack pass by Sa\u00efss. Galeno feeds Paulinho, who finishes well. Another perfect finish from the Colombian. Barasic\u2019s cross from the left was ideal, and the striker leapt between two defenders to glance a header into the top corner from 10 yards. A brilliant goal that could clinch Rangers\u2019 place in the next round. 63 min: Morelos has an appeal for a penalty turned down after the centreback climbs over him. Here is the side that will host Rennes. Celtic: Forster; Bauer, Ajer, Julien, Taylor; McGregor, Brown; Forrest, Christie, Morgan; Ntcham 62 min: Rangers are nothing like the limp side of the first half. They\u2019re starting to really rattle their hosts now. Morelos comes close to scoring a second but is denied by the keeper, who paws his 20-yard shot out for a corner. As things stand, with Rangers drawing and Porto losing, Steven Gerrard\u2019s side would advance to the next round. Rangers are level! Davis sprayed the ball wide to Kent on the left. Kent sent a lovely cross to the far post, leaving Senesei not knowing how to deal with it. While the defender tried to make up his mind, Morelos kept his eye on the ball and, without out even having to jump, heads it past the keeper from six yards. That\u2019s his 23rd goal of the season, his 12th in this competition! 51 min: Wolves almost add to their lead. A delightful run and cross by Traor\u00e9 gave Jota a chance to outjump the defender and nod towards goals. But the keeper made a decent save. \u201cIn the action photos from Braga, the stands appear to be as empty as a pocket,\u201d notes poor Peter Oh. \u201cAre the Portuguese club serving some sort of closed stadium ban, or are Wolves not deemed exciting enough of a draw?\u201d It sure is a small crowd. Maybe the ticket prices were too high? Or folks have been put off by the awful weather? There are plenty of Wolves fans there, though. I can\u2019t see them but they\u2019re making plenty of noise. Nuno had a dream, apparently. Here is the side that the still employed Unai Emery hopes has picked. Xhaka is back!: Arsenal: Martinez; Mustafi, David Luiz, Sokratis, Chambers, Willock, Xhaka, Tierney; Martinelli, Aubameyang, Sako Lots of half-time scores: Braga 1-3 Wolves Feyenoord 1-0 Rangers Young Boys 1-0 Porto CSKA 0-0 Ludogorets Ferencvaros 1-1 Espanyol Olesandra 0-1 Wolfsburg Saint Etienne 0-0 Gent Basakeshir 0-3 Roma WAC 0-0 Monchengladbach Besiktas 0-1 Slovan Bratislava AZ Alkmaar 0-2 Partizan Half-time: Back in Portugal, against a team wearing something close to the Arsenal kit, Nuno is having a ball. Wolves have come from behind to lead 3-1 and they fully deserve it. Jimenez has been particularly brilliant in a splendid collective performance so far. As for Rangers at Feyenoord, not so much. They trail 1-0 after being dominated in the first half. 43 min: Tavernier curls in a dangerous freekick, but Feyenoord clear. Still, Rangers are at least ending the half at the right end of the pitch. 41 min: Rangers are being overwhelmed in Rotterdam and can be grateful to Feyenoord\u2019s shoddy finishing for the score being only 1-0. GOAL! Besiktas 0-1 Slovan Bratislava (Daniel 35) A win would keep the Slovaks in contention, making their final group game - at home to Braga - very interesting. Two goals in 82 seconds! And this, too, is a super finish, as Traor\u00e9 rockets a low shot under the keeper from 16 yards. Wolves are heading for the knockout phase! A lovely goal by the Irishman! Jimenez clipped in a cross and Doherty, having charged into the box, slams a header downwards past the keeper. Feyenoord\u2019s domination reaps its reward, albeit with unwitting assistance from Rangers. First,a header by Barasic was too weak to count as a clearance, then Toornstra\u2019s shot from 20 yards skimmed off Helander\u2019s knee and into the net! GOAL! Basakeshir 0-1 Roma (Veretout 30). The Italians take the lead through a penalty. If this were to be the final score, they would be right back in qualification contention. If the Turks can turn it around, they will go through. 28 min: Doherty does well down the right again for Wolves, but the keeper rushes out to claim his cross. But Wolves are doing even better down the left, where Jonny and Jota are making regular gains. Jota has just cracked a low shot wide of the far post after another sharp move. GOAL! AZ Alkmaar 0-2 Partizan (Soumah 27) The Dutch side could seal qualification today, but not by playing the way they are at the moment. 23 min: Sinisterra skies the ball over the bar from 10 yards after Feyenoord open up Rangers down the right. Meanwhile, William Hargreaves has a grievance with my Nuno/Arsenal comment in the preamble. \u201cThere can\u2019t be that many bigger and better run clubs than Arsenal, can there, over the last quarter century, for example? Okay, there\u2019s the big two in Spain, one each in France, Italy and Germany, and two or three in England, debatably, but to suggest this wouldn\u2019t be an exciting move up from Spurs seems a little dry? I\u2019ve heard commentators describe their squad as the third best in the PL, they\u2019re one of the most profitable (possibility of investment), and with that wealth of young talent coming on, I\u2019d have thought a chap of Nuno\u2019s capability and ambition would be chomping at the bit.\u201d Firstly, Arsenal do not have the third best squad in the Premier League. Secondly, it\u2019s the next 2-5 years - not the last 25 years - you need to be looking at. How well run are Arsenal now? Nuno could do better. GOAL! Alkmaar 0-1 Partizan (Asano 16). The Serbs have to win this to remain in contention for qualification. 17 min: McGregor makes a terrific save to deny Sinisterra. Moments later, Feyenoord threaten again, with a shot by Larsson deflected wide at the near post. Jimenez\u2019s goal reminds me that one of the best headed goals I\u2019ve ever seen was scored by a Mexcian. Remember this from Jared Borgetti at the 2002 World Cup? A lovely goal! Moutinho fed Jonny, who delivered a sumptuous cross to the back post. Jimenez arrived and angled an expert header in at the far post. 10 min: Doherty and Traor\u00e9 combine nicely down the right until the latter slightly overruns the ball, giving the left-back an opportunity to step in and dispossesses him. GOAL! Young Boys 1-0 Porto (Fassnacht 6). That will be enough to put the Swiss through in Rangers\u2019 group if the score stays the same. The hosts take the lead with first shot of the match! But it was all thanks to a diabolical deflection off Ruben Neves. The young of the Horta brothers tried his luck from nearly 25 yards and Rui Patricio would have claimed it easily if not for the nick off Neves\u2019 foot. 4 min: Rangers are having to play a containment game at the minute, as Feyenoord pop the ball around brightly in search of an opening. 3 min: Wolves have made a confident start in Braga, passing the ball around progressively. But Jota has just brought a promising move to an undignified end by donking a cross straight to the nearest defender. Over at Feyenoord, meanwhile, the stadium is packed and very noisy. You\u2019d suggest the atmosphere would be intimidating if you didn\u2019t know Rangers are somewhat experienced in dealing with intensely hostile away environments. The players of Braga and Wolves have entered the pitch, which almost looks like a paddyfield. Yep, it\u2019s raining in Portugal like it\u2019s never going to stop. Maybe that\u2019s why there\u2019s a very low turnout in the stands. The other results from the earlier kickoffs: Group C: Trabzonspor 0-1 Getafe. The Turks were already eliminated, the Spaniards\u2019 fate will be decided on the last group day. Krasnodor 1-0 Basel. Basel are already through. Krasnodor and Getafe will contest the group\u2019s other qualifying spot. United gave debuts to seven players as they fielded their youngest ever team for a European club game. They could offer that learning experience because they had already booked their passage to the next round. Scott Murray is covering Astana v Manchester United v Astana here, with the score 2-1 with 15 minutes to go. The only other goal in the early games so far has come in Turkey, where Trabzonspor are trailing 1-0 to Getafe. Feyenoord: Marsman; Geertruida, Botteghin, Senesi, Malaca; Toomstra, Fer, Kokcu; Berghuis, Sinisterra, Larsson Rangers: Mcgregor; Tavernier, Goldson, Helander, Barisic; Jack, Davis, Kamara; Ojo, Morelos, Kent Braga: Eduardo; Esgaio, Vianna, Wallace, Sequeira; A Horta, Fransergio, Palhinha, R Horta; Paulinho, Galeno Wolves: Rui Patricio; Dendoncker, Coady, Sa\u00efss; Doherty, Neves, Moutinho, Otto; Traor\u00e9, Jimenez, Jota Hello. The Europa League group stages is reaching a climax and British clubs are well positioned. In the next hour Rangers and Wolves will be kicking off against their respective opponents knowing that victories could secure their place in the next round. A win or draw would definitely do the job for Wolves, who hope that Nuno Espirito Santo\u2019s return to Portugal does not coincide with his last match as Wolves manager before Arsenal come calling. He would certainly be a good choice for Arsenal but would Arsenal be a good choice for him? He\u2019s got a good thing going at Wolves, a club on the up and up. My free advice would be to continue building there and then if there comes a time when he fancies a move, bigger and better run clubs than Arsenal will be happy to have him. But we\u2019re getting ahead of ourselves - which is something Nuno always warns against - and the matter to hand is to beat Braga, who are a very decent side and already won at Molineux earlier in the group. Meanwhile, Rangers could advance if they win at Feyenoord (and Porto fail to beat Young Boys), who are a different outfit to the one they beat 1-0 at Ibrox earlier in the competition. Since then Jaap Stam has been given the boot and Feyenoord have hired none other than the former Rangers hero Dick Advocaat as their new manager. But Advocaat has lots of injury problems going into this game so Steven Gerrard will feel a win is within reach. Even a draw would be enough if Young Boys get the better of Porto. Later, Arsenal and Celtic will be in action, too. In all, 17 teams could clinch a place in the last 32 today. Here\u2019s a list - if you don\u2019t like where your team is mentioned, take it up with the alphabet: APOEL, AZ Alkmaar, Arsenal, Braga, CFR Cluj, Copenhagen, Dynamo Kyiv, Gent, \u0130stanbul Ba\u015fak\u015fehir, LASK, Ludogorets, M\u00f6nchengladbach, Rangers, Sporting CP, Wolfsburg, Wolves, Young Boys"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
