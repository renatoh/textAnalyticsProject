Mr Blair was commenting on reports that a panel of experts working for the UN weapons inspectors had concluded Iraq was developing a ballistic missile, the Samoud 2, which had a range greater than the permitted 93 miles. \"If the news is true, that is a significant breach of 1441,\" he told reporters at a news conference in Downing Street today after early morning talks with the Australian prime minister, John Howard. Mr Blair said resolution 1441 had been a \"final opportunity\" for the Iraqi leader to offer total cooperation with the weapons inspectors, but said he would await tomorrow's crucial report to the UN security counci, before stating whether there was a case for immediate military action. \"Any evidence that comes to light of a failure to declare honestly, and any evidence of a breach of resolution 1441, is extremely important, because it indicates the futility of simply going on with more and more and more time, when it's perfectly obvious they're not cooperating,\" he added. Mr Howard echoed: \"The problem is not time, it's attitude.\" \"There is plenty of material breach around already,\" he added. If Hans Blix, head of the UN monitoring, verification and inspection commission, and Mohammed el-Baradei, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, report tomorrow that Saddam Hussein is still failing to comply with resolution 1441, it is likely to provide a trigger for war. Both leaders also insisted that standing up to Iraq now was an essential precursor to any future action to contain North Korea. \"There's no doubt we have to confront the issue of North Korea,\" Mr Blair said. He added: \"Let nobody be in any doubt, if North Korea is an issue, and we need to confront it ,.. then weakness at this point over Iraq, where the United Nations has a clear declared position, is going to inhibit our ability to confront the dangers of North Korea. \"We have these twin threats of international terrorists and weapons of mass destruction but I believe they're linked, maybe linked very specifically but also in the general sense. However, Mr Blair said that \"different means\" may be used to confront North Korea about its nuclear programme. The Australian prime minister said there was a \"clear link\" between the two \"rogue states\", and warned it would not help the future containment of North Korea to \"go soft on Iraq\". In a staunch defence of Mr Blair's stance on Iraq, Mr Howard said Mr Blair had shown \"strong and effective leadership\" in the face of \"the challenge of our age\". Mr Blair thanked the Australian prime minister for his support and emphasised their joint determination to see the Baghdad regime disarm. \"We have agreed on the need for Iraq to disarm itself completely of weapons of mass destruction, chemical and biological weapons. \"We have agreed that resolution 1441 passed by the United Nations security council has got to be upheld in all its particulars and that Saddam Hussein has got to cooperate fully with inspectors,\" he said. Zimbabwe, North Korea and the \"strong\" state of relations between Britain and Australia were also discussed, Mr Blair said. Questioned about the heightened state of alert over terrorist attacks in the capital, Mr Blair said: \"We cannot, and should not, start disclosing everything that we know or may know. It's important we take every precaution we can in order to keep people safe.\" \"It's important people realise ... that the threat that preoccupies not just this country but Australia, other countries right throughout the world, is the threat of disorder and chaos as a result of terrorist groups, or rogue unstable states, with chemical, biological, potentially nuclear weapons capability,\" he said. The prime minister said the country should \"take every measure to protect ourselves\" and \"do everything we can to root these terrorists out\". In a lighter moment, Mr Blair was asked if he had a message to send to Labour supporters in Australia, who might not be so supportive of action against Iraq. The prime minister responded that it was \"early in the morning\" and that he had already set out his policy clearly. The hardline leader of Australia's Liberal party interjected: \"I'll deliver a message to his Labour counterparts!\" The US and Britain face another uphill struggle on the third day of talks at Nato headquarters where France, Germany and Belgium, last night stuck fast to their blockade of American plans to bolster Turkey's defences against Iraqi retaliation in the event of war. Downing Street said tonight that Mr Blair had written to his Greek counterpart Costas Simitis ahead of Monday's special European summit to discuss the Iraq crisis. No 10 released no details of the letter but said it set out the premier's well-known views. Mr Blair also spoke personally to Mr Simitis and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. Mr Blair's official spokesman said that had been a \"perfectly good conversation. There's a shared objective but clearly a difference of view in how we get there\". \u00b7 Last night Mr Straw said France and Germany would be putting at risk the \"whole authority of the United Nations\" if they voted against a new resolution on Iraq. In a BBC1 televised debate, the foreign secretary said: \"The authority of the United Nations has very supreme importance and it is that which will be undermined if we don't follow through the consequences of what we have said. \"We have to ensure, if words mean anything, that words translate into deeds.\" In the same debate, Falklands war hero Simon Weston accused the government of trying to \"poison\" the crisis with so much \"myth and mystique\" that people were not sure why British troops were being sent to invade Iraq. He said: \"The problem for most of the British public is we have listened to politicians and people with so many different agendas, spin and bluff and throwing smoke in the air and I have to say, even lies, to the general public so often that we are not sure what we are actually listening to now. \"We are not sure why our men and women from our countries are being sent to another country to invade.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
