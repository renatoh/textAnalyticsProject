Failure to beat West Bromwich Albion at St James\u2019 Park on Saturday would dent such optimism considerably, though, leaving McClaren\u2019s team stuck in the bottom three with his position under intense scrutiny. \u201cIt\u2019s a big game,\u201d acknowledged a manager who, despite Newcastle\u2019s \u00a380m investment in new players this season, has only three fit senior defenders and no specialist left-back available to face Tony Pulis\u2019s side. \u201cBut we\u2019ve been in this position all season, so it\u2019s nothing new for us. \u201cOn Wednesday night [when Newcastle lost 3-0 at Everton] Roberto Mart\u00ednez said we reminded him of his old Wigan team during those years when they were in the Premier League\u2019s bottom three for most of the season. He said that in the last 10 games they used to pull some results together and get out of it. They had the talent and, in the last 10 games of the season, they decided to come together as a team.\u201d For a club with a pre-season aim of finishing in the top eight and possibly winning a cup, aiming to emulate a Wigan team who eventually got relegated and is now in League One represents quite a come down. Right now though, staying up is Newcastle\u2019s sole ambition. \u201cI honestly think we can survive,\u201d said McClaren. \u201cEspecially with the players we\u2019ve signed in January [Jonjo Shelvey, Andros Townsend, Henri Saivet and Seydou Doumbia]. We have 12 senior players injured at the moment though, which no one really takes into account. \u201cWhoever I play at left-back against West Brom won\u2019t be happy because it won\u2019t be their natural position \u2013 and Steven Taylor [who has been sidelined by a hamstring injury for five months] will come back at centre-half earlier than we expected.\u201d This lack of defensive options raises the question as to why Newcastle failed to invest in a new left back and centre half during January. \u201cIt certainly wasn\u2019t through a lack of effort but we couldn\u2019t foresee losing three players at Everton,\u201d said McClaren who saw Paul Dummett and Chancel Mbemba sustain hamstring and ankle injuries respectively at Goodison Park where Jamaal Lascelles was also sent off. While Dummett, a left-back or centre-half, could be out for around a month, the principal concern is Mbemba, who has impressed in central defence this season. Initial scans of his ankle have suggested he could be set for a lengthy absence and he has appointments to see two specialists early next week. Taylor\u2019s only game since tearing a hamstring in August has been a behind closed doors practice match at Sunderland which Newcastle lost 6-0 but McClaren hopes he can reprise his once impressive partnership with Fabricio Coloccini. \u201cIt\u2019s great for Steven Taylor,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s been working hard and it\u2019s been a long very, very frustrating time for him. He\u2019s a true Geordie, he\u2019s a Newcastle boy and he wears his heart on his sleeve. We will need his kind of character and commitment tomorrow.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
