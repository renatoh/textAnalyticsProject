The midfielder is back in full training with United after injuring an ankle against Ajax in the Europa League, though is unlikely to be rushed back in time for Sunday's Premier League game at Tottenham. Speaking on behalf of Adidas at the launch of the official \"Albert\" ball for the London 2012 Olympic tournament, Cleverley said he would happily join up with Team GB if selected. \"As a footballer you want to have as many experiences as you can,\" Cleverley said. \"I was talking about the Olympics with Anderson at Manchester United. He played in the last Games for Brazil and he said it was a great football tournament. Other top players have appeared in the Olympics, and to win a gold medal at Wembley would be unbelievable. To have that medal in your trophy cabinet when you have finished would be great.\" Before getting too carried away Cleverley first needs to prove his fitness, after missing most of the season through injury, and then show that his manager's high opinion of his ability is not misplaced. Cleverley was just beginning to earn rave reviews in the opening games of the season before injury ruled him out for the best part of five months, and though he picked up another knock when he made his comeback last month, at least this related to his other ankle. \"My priority has to be getting back into action for Manchester United and trying to make the cut for the Euros,\" he said. \"I don't think it's too late to make a claim for an England place. It was disappointing to have to sit out the Holland game, but with Europa League matches I reckon there are around 20 games left to look forward to before the end of the season. That's enough opportunity for me to get back playing, but more importantly for United to win another title. \"If we could do that this season it would make up for all the injuries I've suffered, the bad results, everything. We have a few local lads in our team, and they are more determined because it is City we are up against, but at the end of the day the major prize is another league title. That's what you set off at the start of the season trying to win, and it doesn't matter whether you are in competition with Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool or City, the title is still what you want most.\" In Cleverley's enforced absence Paul Scholes has been able to make a surprise comeback, surprising both in view of its timing and its effectiveness, but though the 22-year-old's place in the team is directly threatened by the returning veteran, he is too much in awe to bear any malice. \"Being out on loan so often I missed out on the chance to work and train with Paul Scholes, so having him back is an unexpected bonus for me,\" he said. \"He's still in good shape, he has managed to come back and make it look like he has never been away. He has always been a hero of mine. When I was growing up I was a Bradford City supporter, but I always had a bit of a soft spot for Manchester United. \"Beckham, Scholes and Giggs have always been my idols, so to be able to train with two of them day-in, day-out, and learn from them means I've been massively lucky. They don't necessarily take you to one side and coach you, it's more a case of watch and learn. \"Giggsy does give you tips here and there, especially when you're playing at certain grounds, which is helpful, but if you asked me which of their qualities I most admire I would say Giggsy's awareness and Scholesy's passing range. I like the way Paul Scholes gets into the box to score goals as well. I'd like to get more of that into my own game. I scored a few times for my loan clubs, and I am confident in front of goal.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
