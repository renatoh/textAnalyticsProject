The surprise was the victorious manager of the top-10 side was relatively downcast, while the coach of the relegation-haunted losers was swelling with pride. \u201cYou can only win games if you perform and we\u2019ve got to keep performing like that,\u201d Steve McClaren said, beaming. \u201cYou have to play well enough to give yourself a chance and we\u2019re playing well enough in every game. We have to keep doing what we\u2019re doing.\u201d Given Newcastle have won one of their past eight games and had only two shots on target in this one, what they are doing does not seem to be particularly impressive. \u201cWe\u2019ve performed very well but we need to follow that up and we\u2019ve failed to do that,\u201d McClaren said. \u201cLast week we took the opportunity against West Ham. This was a very good opportunity, we should have taken it, we didn\u2019t. We\u2019re a team who\u2019s competing, playing good football, playing well, deserving more from the performances, but not getting it.\u201d Given that Watford had lost their four previous games Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores could not even attempt a similar argument, so in a bewildering atypical move this advocate of tactical, selectorial and, for that matter, sartorial consistency had introduced his team to a new formation only 24 hours before the kick-off. Watford abandoned their favoured 4-4-1-1 for the first time this season as S\u00e1nchez Flores sacrificed wide midfielders to counter Newcastle\u2019s threat in the centre. \u201cWhen I analysed Newcastle with Shelvey, he makes the other big players, good players, play well \u2013 really well,\u201d S\u00e1nchez Flores said. \u201cSo for us it was very important to keep watching Shelvey. Also to attack three defenders we had to think about other things. We were attacking always with Ighalo, with Deeney. We are very predictable. So we needed to think a little bit different. If something is working I don\u2019t like to mix. I don\u2019t like to confuse the players changing the system every single week. I believe a lot in the way we were playing until now but sometimes it is necessary to change.\u201d In further head-scratching analysis, S\u00e1nchez Flores said Watford \u201chad the ball more in the first half and could play well\u201d, while McClaren insisted his side \u201ccontrolled the game in the first half and dominated\u201d. S\u00e1nchez Flores was pleased with the way his side silenced Shelvey, while McClaren thought the player controlled the game. In truth Shelvey\u2019s position at the base of a midfield three made it difficult for him to influence proceedings in key areas, even if it was his corner Jamaal Lascelles headed in with 19 minutes to play. The argument over which side had the better of the first half is moot, since the game was decided at the start of the second. The interplay between Troy Deeney and Odion Ighalo may have become predictable but Newcastle notably failed to anticipate it seconds after the restart as the Nigerian ran on to his partner\u2019s through ball to put the home side ahead, while both were also involved in the build-up to Craig Cathcart\u2019s volleyed second. It was Watford\u2019s third win against Newcastle this season, all by a single goal. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t like to play them every week, because they have a very good team,\u201d S\u00e1nchez Flores said. \u201cWe deserve the victory but they have very good players. We won against an amazing team.\u201d Finally, something on which he and McClaren agreed.
