The Wanderers, who ended Sydney FC\u2019s unbeaten streak with a 1-0 victory at ANZ Stadium on Saturday, were given a show-cause notice by Football Federation Australia on Monday night after banners depicting Sky Blues coach Graham Arnold performing oral sex were displayed by a section of their fans in the stands during the game. FFA branded the banner \u201coffensive to any reasonable member of the public\u201d and invited the club to explain their fans\u2019 actions before a deadline of midday on Thursday. Wanderers CEO John Tsatsimas confirmed the club would do so and took the opportunity to reinforce their stance on the incident. \u201cNotwithstanding that the club has yet to submit its response, Western Sydney Wanderers FC unequivocally states \u2013 and reinforces its position provided on Sunday after the match \u2013 that it does not in any capacity welcome, authorise or condone the display of imagery depicted in a banner on Saturday night. \u201cIt is an affront to many on a multitude of levels and is completely unacceptable.\u201d Tsatsimas said that the club was working with the venue, security and FFA to identify the individuals involved. \u201cAs a club made up of the most diverse and inclusive cross-section of members and fans in Australian sport we are committed to working with FFA and our stadiums to ensure our matches remain a positive family friendly environment,\u201d he added. Wanderers are already under the cloud of a suspended points deduction over trouble associated with the lighting of flares and now potentially face further sanctions, with a fine and restrictions on supporters possible. But the RBB showed no contrition in a social media post, branding FFA \u201cdictatorial\u201d and questioning the governance of the A-League in a strongly-worded statement on the group\u2019s Facebook page. \u201cWe find it ironic that it takes the FFA barely 24 hours to respond to a banner deemed \u2018offensive\u2019, but take over 12 months to even commence an appeals process agreed upon in December 2015,\u201d the RBB said. \u201cClearly football in this country is in the wrong hands. Football belongs to the people, not a dictatorial body or the likes of so-called expert commentators. The sport doesn\u2019t belong to the FFA, nor does it belong to the likes of [television pundit] Robbie Slater. Fuck off with your pandering to mainstream media.\u201d Wanderers striker Brendon Santalab, whose goal proved decisive as his side registered their first derby win in over three years, was critical of the fans responsible and said the club would like to \u201cstamp out\u201d such incidents. Sydney FC have asked FFA to elicit an apology from the Wanderers for coach Arnold, according to AAP. The banner was not the only incident to attract the attention of the authorities on Saturday night: 15 arrests were made, with FFA aiding police in their investigations over a reported brawl between fans."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
