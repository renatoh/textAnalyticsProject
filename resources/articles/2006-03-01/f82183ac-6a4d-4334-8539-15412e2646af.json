Most silent calls are not generated by malicious individuals but by call centres using automated dialling systems that generate more calls than their agents can deal with, leaving silence on the line. Under a voluntary code, such calls should comprise less than 5 per cent of those made by a centre in any 24-hour period for each campaign. But Ofcom says many companies are breaching this, and has set a new call rate at below 3 per cent. Abandoned calls must also carry a short information message and householders will now be able to tell who has phoned by dialling 1471 after a silent call. The Ofcom fine has increased from \u00a35,000 to \u00a350,000 for each rule breach. Home phone owners can also sign up to the Telephone Preference Service to reduce the number of silent calls and register with a free service called Silent CallGuard on 0870 4443969. Pay as you go MILLIONS of UK householders could be forced to have water meters if the government grants other companies the 'water scarcity status' that it gave Dover Water Services last week. The company will be the first to introduce compulsory metering to its 64,000 households over the next nine years. The Consumer Council for Water says other companies in the south of the country that suffer water shortages could apply for the same status soon. CCWater's Andrew Marsh said about 30 per cent of Dover customers will end up paying more, with the rest paying the same or less."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
