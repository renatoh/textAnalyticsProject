Manuel Pellegrini is the division\u2019s defending champion and Brendan Rodgers the reigning manager of the year. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Louis van Gaal are former Champions League winners and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger was a finalist in Europe\u2019s elite competition. The other two, Ronald Koeman and Mauricio Pochettino, became coveted because of their exploits earlier in their careers. Then there is Monk. If a glance at the upper echelons of the Premier League table illustrates what a risk Swansea took to appoint a rookie, it also shows how richly they have been rewarded. \u201cComing in to this job, I understood it was an opportunity that wouldn\u2019t happen very often at this level,\u201d Monk admitted. Yet Swansea\u2019s track record shows they are entitled to opt for an outsider. No City manager has failed since Nick Cusack in 2002 and each of their last seven appointments has enjoyed at least some success. The 35-year-old Monk is tasting it at a tender age, to the surprise of some. \u201cThis season was about me trying to prove those doubters [wrong]. \u201cWhen you achieve things, it helps reaffirm to yourself that you are doing the right thing.\u201d Perhaps the most pertinent comparison is not with his peers, but his predecessors. Monk has taken Swansea to 40 Premier League points in a season quicker than Brendan Rodgers or Michael Laudrup. He is on course to top their record points total, 47, and secure their highest finish. The chance to make history is a carrot. \u201cWe are seven points away,\u201d he noted. This win, thanks to Kieran Trippier\u2019s own goal, was a sign of their evolution. It was a product of solidity but Monk is adamant they have not compromised their passing principles. \u201cIt is still the No1 philosophy and my philosophy as well,\u201d he countered. He believes the statistics support his argument that style remains. \u201cIn 20 games out of 27 we have had the most possession,\u201d he said. \u201cI can show you a number of games where we have scored after 25 or 30 passes.\u201d Now Europe is back on the horizon. \u201cThis is the problem, expectations,\u201d said Monk. \u201cYou have got to dream but you also have to be realistic.\u201d But expectations are the burden of the achieving manager. They are something he may have to get used to. Man of the match Lukasz Fabianski (Swansea City)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
