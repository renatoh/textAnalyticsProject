This week, Scottish Power became the first company to increase its bills in 2006, while fears are growing that British Gas may increase prices for its 11m customers by as much as 25%. For consumers already struggling to cope with last year's increases, it will be a bitter blow. Average household bills are now approaching \u00a31,000 a year and a million people look set to be thrown back into \"fuel poverty\" - the term used to describe households where 10% or more of their income goes on paying gas and electricity bills. Behind the price rises are problems with foreign supplies, political uncertainty around the world and declining UK reserves. From March, Scottish Power's 5.2m customers will be paying 15% more for their gas and 8% more for electricity. Last October, the company raised gas bills by 12% and hiked electricity costs by 5%-8%. If British Gas increases prices by 25%, it will send average annual energy bills above the \u00a31,000 barrier for the first time. It would also mean British Gas customers will be paying 70% more for their gas than they were two years ago. And if all that wasn't enough, there's another cold snap reportedly on the way for the middle of next week. So what can you as a consumer do? Last Monday, trade and industry secretary Alan Johnson told a parliamentary committee that it was not the government's role to intervene in a deregulated market, even in the face of significant price rises. His best advice to consumers was to switch suppliers. The simple truth is that consumers who have never switched away from British Gas and their regional electricity board, must enjoy throwing away money. Despite the fact that this is a market that is almost entirely dominated by price, there is still a hard core of UK households reluctant to switch. Many will have been put off by some of the nightmare stories that have followed some switches (see below); others are cynical as to whether they will actually save any money in the long run. Those who have always adopted the \"can't be bothered\" attitude are now throwing away up to \u00a3200 a year. While the power companies traditionally take their lead from British Gas, this week Guardian Money reveals which companies have charged the lowest prices over the past two years. As the disclaimers always explain, past performance is no guide to the future. Joe Malinowski, managing director of switching site TheEnergyShop.com has spent the past two weeks poring over spreadsheets and has named and shamed the best and worst energy companies. His figures show that average gas prices have risen \u00a3126 (38%) a year since January 2004 and now stand at \u00a3454. Powergen customers did best overall with increases limited to just \u00a3106 (33%) a year - Telecom Plus customers fared worst with a massive increase of \u00a3167 a year. Atlantic Electric &amp; Gas remains the cheapest licensed gas supplier and British Gas, despite a lower than average gas price increase, remains the most expensive of the major suppliers. In the electricity market, prices have risen by \u00a367 or 26% a year since January 2004 and now stand at \u00a3323. In general, customers of ScottishPower, Powergen and Scottish &amp; Southern Energy fared the best with increases in the \u00a350-\u00a365 a year range (20%-25%). Customers of npower and EDF Energy have come off worst with an average increase of \u00a378-\u00a380 a year (30% plus). Overall, he says: \u00b7 Typical dual fuel savings for customers switching from British Gas and their local electricity supplier are around \u00a3150 to \u00a3180 a year (20%-22%) but can be as high a \u00a3200 a year (25%). \u00b7 Customers paying by cash or cheque switching to the best dual fuel deal and simultaneously moving to a monthly direct debit tariff will do best of all. The average household can save \u00a3220 a year (26%) and in some areas up to \u00a3276 a year (32%) in this way. \u00b7 Gas customers paying by cash or cheque can currently save themselves up to \u00a3132 a year by switching away from British Gas. Electricity savings for customers switching away from the local supplier are typically \u00a345-\u00a355 a year but can be as high as \u00a370-\u00a380 a year. Online only accounts where the company emails you your bill can save a further \u00a340 a year. \"Energy consumers have endured a lot of pain over the past two years. In total that has added \u00a34bn a year to household budgets. However, we are not over the worst yet. With wholesale gas prices trading at a big premium to retail selling prices, further price increases are inevitable and probably imminent. Switching supplier is still the easiest way to take the sting out of rising energy costs,\" says Mr Malinowski. He suggests that it is only a matter of time before the next round of increases starts, and for this reason capped price products look like a good place to head. Those signing up at present to the best such deals pay a premium of around 18%. \"Future prices for January 2007 are already significantly up on prices this time last year and capped price deals look like a good bet again - particularly as you can always switch away if prices turn out to be lower than expected. Scottish Power's, EDF's and Powergen's capped deals are probably the best at the moment but given this week's announcement by Scottish Power, consumers should act fast,\" he says. Those wanting to cap for the longest possible period should head to EDF - its capped deal currently runs into 2008. The other two run until October 2007. British Gas quietly removed its 2010 capped product for new customers at the beginning of January. Switching supplier is easy and takes around two weeks to complete. The EnergyShop.com, Uswitch or Simply Switch will all advise as to the cheapest in your area. The Energy Shop can be telephoned on 0845 330 7247. Capped deals will not appear in the top 10.

She was advised by Simply Switch to sign up to small supplier Utilita just over a year ago, and was promised a 10% rebate after the first 12 months. However, instead of getting the promised cash she was later transferred to another energy company, and hit with a \u00a340 surcharge. Utilita is one of several small companies that found itself unable to cope with the dramatic rise in wholesale gas prices. In December, it sold its 5,000 domestic customers to the French giant EDF. It has since been heavily criticised by the consumer body Energywatch for imposing an \"illegal surcharge\" on customers. Four other small companies have ceased trading over the past six weeks and their customers were switched over to an Ofgem-appointed supplier. \"The whole thing has been a nightmare. Just before Christmas, Utilita wrote and said I was being moved to EDF. Utilita refused to pay the rebate and to add insult to injury it imposed a \u00a340 surcharge to cover its increased costs. Because my account was in credit, I lost this money,\" says Annabel. She contacted Energywatch which admitted there is very little it can do to get her money back. Utilita managing director David Casale refused to discuss the lack of rebate for what he said were legal reasons, but said he believed the \u00a340 surcharge to be legal. \"We will not be handing it back unless forced to by a court,\" he said. Mrs Nixson has now opted to switch to British Gas's capped price product and has been presented with a bill for \u00a397 by EDF. \"I usually pay around \u00a360 a month for gas and electricity - why has it risen to almost \u00a3100 the only month I'm with EDF?\" she asks. EDF told the Guardian it won't be paying any rebates promised by Utilita. \"You'd think the regulator would step in to help people like me,\" says Mrs Nixson. Ofgem has warned Utilita that it is potentially in breach of its licence obligations, but this may not amount to anything as it is no longer trading in energy. m.brignall@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
