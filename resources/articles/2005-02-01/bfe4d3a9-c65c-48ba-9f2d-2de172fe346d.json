Mr Hariri, a billionaire property magnate who served as prime minister for 10 of the last 15 years, was killed with 13 others on Tuesday when a 300kg suicide car bomb struck his motorcade as it passed along the Beirut waterfront. A previously unknown group calling itself Victory and Jihad has claimed responsibility for the blast, but many in Lebanon blame Syria for carrying out, or at least having a hand in Mr Hariri's assassination. Washington last night withdrew its ambassador to Syria in an expression of its \"profound outrage\" at the killing. Suspicions of Syrian involvement - which Damascus has denied - charged the atmosphere in Beirut and members of the pro-Syrian government were advised by Mr Hariri's family and supporters to stay away from his funeral. The man who became politically and financially synonymous with Lebanon's post-civil war reconstruction resigned from the government in October after Damascus intervened to extend the term in office of the country's pro-Syrian president, Emile Lahoud. Since then, Mr Hariri has increasingly been regarded as a member of the opposition. Grieving relatives, including his three sons, carried his coffin, draped in a red, white and green Lebanese flag, out of an ambulance and through a heaving crowd of more than 200,000 people who had gathered outside the Mohammed al-Amin mosque, which was commissioned by Mr Hariri. Many mourners scrambled to touch the casket as it passed. Mr Hariri's eldest son, Baha, climbed on top of several people's shoulders to shout into a microphone demanding calm from the heaving crowd. \"We don't want his last minutes to be like this. Step back away from his body,\" he said. Breaking with tradition, hundreds of weeping women waving white handkerchiefs joined men for the procession. Sunni Muslim clerics, Druze religious leaders and ordinary Lebanese Shia Muslims and Christians all took part - a demonstration of Mr Hariri's popularity and ability to reach across potentially volatile sectarian divides. The crowd was the largest seen in Lebanon since close to one million listened to Pope John Paul II deliver mass in Beirut. As Lebanon grieved on the second of three days of national mourning, international pressure mounted to find Mr Hariri's killers. The UN security council approved a statement urging the Lebanese government to \"bring to justice the perpetrators, organisers and sponsors of this heinous terrorist act\". Lebanon's interior minister suggested a suicide bomber aided by \"international parties\" may have been behind it. Syrian forces helped to bring stability to Lebanon after the civil war, and about 14,000 troops remain in the country. Their continued presence is a source of frustration for many Lebanese - who oppose Syrian interference in their country's affairs - and for the international community, particularly Washington. Some have suggested the killing was carried out by rogue Syrian intelligence operatives, or factions among Lebanon's myriad religious groups. Lebanese authorities have described responsibility claims by previously unknown Islamist militants as not credible."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
