It wasn't long before I learnt one thing: something is seriously amiss in university teaching. I've stood there, in front of classes of excitable kids, anxious sixth-formers, expectant undergraduates and assured postgrads. I've taught everything from simple number bonds to existential psychology. I've served my time. Believe me, I know a good lesson from a bad one. The drive for quality assurance in higher education is creating a travesty of teaching. Rather than drive up quality, sessions are becoming uniformly dull. Students are switching off. Teachers are losing sight of the broader goals of education and focusing on the nar row demands of evaluation. What was it that turned my initial enthusiasm into a sense of boredom, frustration and disengagement, surely the three deadly sins of the learning process? It can be summed up in one word: PowerPoint, the favoured tool of presentation for the unimaginative. All right, perhaps that is unfair, but I am suffering the after-effects of a surfeit of lifeless, list-full PowerPoint presentations that frequently served as a barrier to meaningful engagement between tutor, student and learning. I know it isn't supposed to be like that, I know it is meant to be a step up from overhead projector slides and has potential for varied use, but my experiences were otherwise. It all became so routine, so anodyne, so dull. No matter what the inherent potential of the material to be covered, once that computer came into play, it invariably became a process of tutor with remote handset talking to the screen and flicking through the sequences of pages. Not talking to us. Not making eye contact and engaging in genuine exchanges with the electronically illuminated faces staring screenwards. Just talking to the screen, pressing the button and talking until all the slides were complete. It only became interesting when thumbs and buttons interacted too excitedly and pages were skipped through accidentally. Then we could have a re-run, a kind of inaction replay. Some tutors admitted their lack of comfort with the technology and gave us hand-outs of the slides they were going to project, but the images on them were so reduced as to be almost unreadable without high-powered lenses, and if the photocopier was temperamental were blurred anyway. This PowerPointlessness was not rare. It was as regular as a politician's evasion. Only one tutor actually deviated, by choice and conviction, from using this technological tool, and he made the sessions a joy, involving the class in discussion, requiring us to think issues through and be critical, drawing on topical references to make his points more accessible and clear. In short, he engaged with us and we responded like the drought-ridden to a downpour. It was liberating, it was damn near exhilarating, but it was fleeting. All too soon, the disk dealers would return to take up the reins and back would come the disemPowerPoint and that dreadful mask of passive boredom would settle on our faces. Strangely, within that passivity there would be activity, but of a sort that had little to do with what was intended in the lesson outcomes. Different strategies became apparent among us students. Some dozed and dreamed or doodled in time-dishonoured fashion; others took refuge in their mobile phones, sending or reading text messages, or playing games. In the corner in which I regularly sat, there were competitions of hangman, complete the song lyric, and quizzes of one sort or another. The professional teacher in me could not help but be horrified, but the bored student in me often joined in. It was not long before this kind of subversion became more obvious as students started to skip classes. There were times when attendance slumped to 50%. Some students even disappeared in the mid-session break, deciding that it wasn't worth staying and electing to do something else instead. My reaction to this surprised me: I felt they had a justification for doing so. I felt like doing the same, particularly when we spent sessions reading on the screen what was already given to us in booklet form. Where was the point in that? A bit of time spent in the library often seemed a much better option. Yes, I know there is a moral question in here, or at least an issue concerning commitment or participation. Yet in conversations I had with my fellow students on these matters, and we talked about them constantly, these very important values repeatedly came up for debate. My colleagues were committed, they wanted to participate, but felt sidelined and devalued. They felt talked down to. This was a postgraduate course but the consensus was that prior learning and experience were rendered invisible. The more time that passed, the more difficult it became to feel one had a point worth voicing, until the voices fell almost completely silent. The reluctance to participate grew like a debilitating illness and infected us all. I became as mute as most. My prior existence as a teacher offered no solution. I could only watch in dumb horror. Do I blame the tutors? No, I see them as victims of the drive for accountability and so-called quality assurance. I see them anxious and pressured. The pressure became apparent when they asked for student evaluation of modules. We didn't par ticularly wish to make evaluations. Many students questioned the point of them: after all, we would be evaluating something that we would not be experiencing again, so any changes would be for the benefit of next year's cohort. Some complained that the evaluations had to be completed in a particular way, and refused to comply. Others said their evaluations would be so critical of some of the sessions that they would rather keep quiet than be so negative. This refusal became more pronounced when, with returns being pitifully low, tutors would plead, cajole or even berate us in the hope of getting more. In a way, this non-submission of evaluation forms was a form of evaluation in itself, but it certainly was not what the university was seeking. Do I have a solution? I would like to see a change in the evaluation process. Yes, it is useful to gain feedback from students, but currently it seems over-bureaucratised, obsessive and counter-productive. I believe the drive for quality is achieving the opposite effect. It is undermining the professional skills of practitioners and clouding their classroom performance. For the students it seems like an endless round of customer satisfaction surveys which, after a while, becomes a chore with little tangible payback. Is it to benefit the student's learning experience, or achieve a good rating on a scale of teaching quality? It is my belief that the two are only tangentially related. What the students are asked to evaluate does not necessarily include the issues that concern them. My recent experience confirmed for me that students above all else want to feel valued as scholars, not as customers; to feel supported in their learning by available tutors, not online resources; to be seen as indi viduals, not some amorphous mass. Measures of accountability invariably focus on what is easily quantified. This limits what teaching and learning is seen as. It is a reductionist approach that stifles imagination and encourages uniformity. Teaching becomes a formula to follow without deviation, and learning a stultifying process. There is a drive to introduce ICT increasingly into the learning process, but it appears to require the teacher to take on the role of technician. I have always believed the best teachers were those who connected with their students on a personal level, who strove to engage with their minds, who exuded enthusiasm for their subject, and who worked on a process of joint construction of knowledge. In my recent experience, this was missing. I felt something was lost. In the end I think it was me. \u00b7 The name of the author has been changed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
