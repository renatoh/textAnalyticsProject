The severity of the injury isn\u2019t clear but it almost certainly ends KD\u2019s series. What more can you say about this Finals? At every step of the way it has confounded expectations and refused to follow any sort of pattern. What we have left is a series of questions: Can the Raptors come back mentally after whiffing on a golden opportunity to seal their first championship in front of their home crowd? Can the Warriors keep going despite their continuing injury luck, most likely without even the hope of Durant returning to play series savior? Who knows. All that\u2019s certain now is that it\u2019s a 3-2 series. There will be a Game 6 will be on Thursday in Oracle Arena, whether that\u2019s the end point or just another stop on route a Game 7 remains to be seen. The Guardian will continue to have coverage of the NBA Finals but this will conclude today\u2019s liveblog. Make sure you read our game report linked below. Thanks to everybody for following along with us, particularly all those who contributed along the way. Ciao! I hate to do this to the guy, but for posterity it\u2019s probably worthwhile to record the fact that Kyle Lowry\u2019s attempted game-winner will not win over anybody skill skeptical about his postseason play. Steve Kerr attempts to summarize just what happened in the last few hours; Email from Peter Oh: We the west. A gutty emotional win for the Warriors. There\u2019s something to be said about Finals experience, it seems. Meanwhile, although disappointed, the Raptors have to still feel good about their chances. They almost just stole a game here. They have two more chances to win, including a Game 7 on the road. The Warriors have to worry about not having Durant and possibly Looney. I am still processing what just happened here. The Warriors almost lost control of things here, but they managed to come back late from a six point deficit with less than two minutes left in the game. Of course, they will likely have to win the next two games without Durant, who looks to be quite seriously hurt after his comeback attempt was cut short. There will be a Game 6 and one last game in Oracle Arena! Wow! Warriors 106-105 Raptors, FINAL Cousins gets called for a moving screen! Offensive turnover! This is disastrous for Golden State. The Raptors have a chance to win it right here. Lowry gets off a shot and\u2026 it\u2019s NO GOOD. The Warriors survive Game 5! Warriors 106-105 Raptors, 29.9, 4th quarter Gasol misses out of the Raptors timeout, Cousins gets a key rebound but Draymond Green gets called for a back court violation. This is getting crazy. Raptors have another chance here, and they get the benefit of a goal-tend call on Cousins. That could be big. Warriors 106-103 Raptors, 56.6, 4th quarter Raptors turn it over. The Warriors have the ball back and it\u2019s still a one-possession game. Not anymore. Curry hits a long three and Thompson hits one on the next Golden State possession and they have the lead! Wow! Warriors 100-103 Raptors, 1:59, 4th quarter The ruling on the court is confirmed. Huge call that. Warriors 100-103 Raptors, 1:59, 4th quarter And an offensive interference call wipes away a DeMarcus Cousins tip-in. They\u2019re going to review it however. Warriors 100-103 Raptors, 2:20, 4th quarter Leonard actually misses out of the timeout, pretty badly. Good defense by the Warriors, but can they get back on offense? They can. Thompson hits a long three pointer. Warriors 97-103 Raptors, 3:05, 4th quarter Warriors are just out of sorts and Leonard is unstoppable now. He hits a pull-up jumper and the Raptors extend the lead. Curry misses yet again, VanVleet gets the rebound. The Raptors slow things down and finally take a timeout. The crowd is as loud as its ever been which feels not scientifically possible. Warriors 97-101 Raptors, 3:54, 4th quarter Curry misses, Leonard hits another shot. Oh no, he\u2019s awake. Draymond cuts the lead back to a single point with a quick basket. Oh and Leonard has hit another three-pointer. The tide feels like its turned Warriors 95-96 Raptors, 5:09, 4th quarter And there goes the lead. Iguodala misses a shot and Leonard hits a super-long three. Email from Thomas Cook: I\u2019m watching from Australia and I follow the Raptors. Would you put Ibaka as the most efficient player these finals ?? There\u2019s a good argument for it, he\u2019s definitely made the most coming out of the bench. Obviously, Kawhi Leonard has been the series MVP so far, but Ibaka will deserve some major props for his contributions. Warriors 95-93 Raptors, 5:36, 4th quarter Norman Powell with a dunk and the Warriors take a timeout. Things feel on the brink for them. In fact, they\u2019ve felt on the brink much of this quarter. Warriors 95-91 Raptors, 6:32, 4th quarter Draymond Green with a three-pointer the Warriors desperately needed. Leonard misses for Toronto and the Warriors get the ball back but Draymond gets called for traveling. Warriors 92-91 Raptors, 6:54, 4th quarter Kevon Looney will not be returning to this game, so the news just keeps getting worse for the Warriors. It doesn\u2019t get much better when the basketball starts up again as Curry gets his shot blocked and, at the other end, Leonard gets a rebound and deposits into the basket to a huge cheer. Now this? This might be a jinx. Email from Jean Wan: I\u2019ve never watched an NBA game in my life, and now that the bandwagon has arrived and I\u2019m watching, I\u2019m cursing the Raptors!! I\u2019m a bad, bad Canadian. Well, don\u2019t speak so soon. It\u2019s just a one possession game now. Warriors 92-89 Raptors, 8:13, 4th quarter Ibaka with a slam! Warriors with a timeout! What a Finals for Ibaka. Warriors 92-87 Raptors, 8:13, 4th quarter Warriors turn it over and Kyle Lowry hits a three-pointer and all the momentum is with Canada at the moment. Never mind Curry just scored, every time they have an answer it seems. Warriors 90-84 Raptors, 9:26, 4th quarter Quinn Cook gets a three-pointer, Lowry hits a jumper on the other end. Hey look it\u2019s Quinn Cook again he finds Jordan Bell (remember him?) for a quick score to respond to the Toronto response. Warriors 85-82 Raptors, 10:11, 4th quarter Normal Powell, who is in the game by the way, finds Ibaka for an alley-oop. On the other end, Cousins misses a three. Ibaka scores again on the other end and it\u2019s a one-possession game again. Warriors 85-78 Raptors, 11:30, 4th quarter Raptors don\u2019t score on their possession. Cousins gets to the line on the other end, he misses the first free throw but finally makes one on his fourth attempt of the game. Email from \u201creneaflunoy67\u201d Subject: Raptors I want them to win it all! Kawhi is a beast! Leonard\u2019s going to have step things up from that third quarter if the Raptors are going to come back to win this one. I have confidence that he will. Warriors 84-78 Raptors, end of the 3rd quarter Ibaka tips in a Siakam shot and Leonard makes one of two free throws. Iguodala just misses on the Warriors end. Raptors walk it back but turn it over on their possession. Draymond Green misses at the end of the third quarter but the Warriors remain in front. Warriors 84-75 Raptors, 1:52, 3rd quarter Warriors have the ball out of the timeout. Green finds Cousins all by himself under the basket and that\u2019s as easy as two-points as you\u2019re going to get for Golden State. How the Warriors are managing to stay in the lead: This sounds like worst case scenario. Warriors 82-75 Raptors, 2:12, 3rd quarter Lowry gets knocked down but completes a layup. Curry misses a wide-open three. When Ibaka loses a ball out of bounds, the Warriors decide that now\u2019s the time for a timeout. Warriors 82-73 Raptors, 2:50, 3rd quarter The three-point shooting is what\u2019s keeping the Warriors ahead despite Toronto\u2019s constant runs. A goal-tend call increases the Warriors lead. Warriors 80-73 Raptors, 3:21, 3rd quarter Thompson misses a three, VanVleet hits a three. Maybe a time for a Warriors timeout? Nope, but Gasol does pick up a non-shooting foul. That\u2019s his fourth. The Warriors turn it over, they need to stop doing that, and Lowry banks one home. That\u2019s a 10 point run\u2026 but Thompson stops it with a three. Warriors 77-68 Raptors, 4:50, 3rd quarter Thompson fouls Gasol. He hits the first of two free throws, as Cousins replace a pained Looney. Gasol then goes ahead and makes the second. He\u2019s up to 16 points. Warriors 77-66 Raptors, 5:19, 3rd quarter Iguodala blocks Lowry\u2019s shot on the release, but Golden State can\u2019t capitalize on offense. On the other end, Lowry gets called on a loose ball foul which puts Looney to the ground. Looney grimaces but stays in the game. Gasol picks up one as well. Looney looks okay at the end of the possession as he scores to increase the Warriors lead. But, hey, VanVleet nails a three-pointer that beats the buzzer for Toronto. Warriors 75-63 Raptors, 7:00, 3rd quarter Well there\u2019s another three-pointer, this time thanks to Iguodala. Thompson scores on a fast break and the Raptors are going to wisely expend a timeout. Out of the break we get the umpteenth \u201cOld Town Road\u201d of the NBA Finals. Warriors 70-63 Raptors, 7:44, 3rd quarter Siakam with a score and foul, he misses the free throw. Doris Burke comes in with another Durant update. He won\u2019t return this game (which was pretty obvious the second the injury happened) and has a \u201clower leg injury\u201d and will have a MRI tomorrow. That\u2019s all we get for now. Curry gets another three-pointer for Golden State, they could use as many of those as possible with Durant gone for good. Warriors 67-61 Raptors, 9:16, 3rd quarter Lowry starts the scoring for the Raptors with a sweet spin move. VanVleet hits a corner three to cut the Warriors lead down some more. Warriors 67-56 Raptors, 10:43, 3rd quarter Iguodala, right by the basket, squeezes through defenders and starts off the second half scoring. VanVleet takes a long three that doesn\u2019t connect. Thompson makes yet another three-pointer on the Warriors end and the lead\u2019s back to double-digits. Warriors 62-56 Raptors, 12:00, 3rd quarter And the second half begins! Let\u2019s see if we\u2019ll have a Game 6 or not. Despite the Warriors lead, that sounds about right. I wonder if there will be any deflation in the Golden State locker room considering the Durant situation. Email from Clare McConnell: I suspect you are an American and have therefore not noticed how biased the refs have been up till the last few minutes. Canadians have to suspect that the no doubt American refs don\u2019t want the trophy to leave the good old US of A I haven\u2019t noticed the refs overtly favoring one team or the other here, to be honest. I will say that the only conspiracy I believe as far as officiating is that they are always for longer playoff series. If there\u2019s any sort of bias it\u2019s not based on basketball patriotism. Instead of going straight to commercial, the broadcast goes to Doris Burke who has an update from the locker room. There\u2019s no official update on Durant, but the report is ominous with everybody giving Durant \u201cspace\u201d to process the injury. It\u2019s really a shame since he clearly did his best to return, possibly before he was really ready, and managed to play quite well to start the game. Also, as the broadcast point out, he is a free agent. And Siakam slices the lead back down to one-point for a handful of seconds. Curry quiets the crowd with a trademark long-distancer. Iggy then tips in a Curry shot to extend the Warriors lead before the end of the first half. Warriors 57-54 Raptors, 1:09, 2nd quarter The Warriors turn the ball over again and Siakam scores and after all that, the Raptors have taken advantage of Golden State\u2019s hiccups and whittled this back down to a one-possession game. Warriors 57-52 Raptors, 1:51, 2nd quarter Iguodala puts Gasol on the line immediately afterwards though, and Gasol goes 2-for-2. Gasol then almost gets a big three-pointer but it just doesn\u2019t come in. On the other end, Thompson gets fouled, that\u2019s the third on Lowry, he makes one of two. And Leonard finds the basket on the other end. Warriors 56-48 Raptors, 3:15, 2nd quarter The Warriors need some points to stabilize this game, so Curry creates contact and gets two free throws which he\u2014of course\u2014nails. Warriors 54-48 Raptors, 3:28, 2nd quarter Cousins draws a foul and gets to the free-throw line. He\u2019s helping the Warriors keep ahead\u2026 except he misses both free throws to the delight of the Raptors crowd. On the other end, Gasol his a three-pointer. Just a disastrous sequence for the Warriors, who know it and call a timeout. Warriors 54-45 Raptors, 4:03, 2nd quarter Cousins tips in a missed Draymond Green three, he\u2019s doing a fantastic job here. Draymond Green then fouls Kyle Lowry, he can\u2019t believe it and he shows no hesitation in complaining. That will mean three free throws for Toronto and he simply can\u2019t be doing that given the circumstances. It\u2019s his sixth technical of the playoffs, which means he\u2019s one away from a suspension. Not that it\u2019ll matter much if the Warriors can\u2019t pull off a win here. Leonard takes and makes the technical. Lowry makes one of two free throws. Warriors 52-43 Raptors, 5:20, 2nd quarter Leonard scores and then gets fouled by Iguodala. He makes both free throws and cuts the Warriors lead into single-digits. Warriors 52-39 Raptors, 6:05, 2nd quarter Leonard with a fantastic block on Thompson! The Warriors still have the ball though. However, Lowry steals the ball clean from Cousins and lays it up on the other end. Curry hits a three on the other end and picks up a foul. He gets the free throw and that\u2019s a four-point play. \u201cAchilles\u201d is trending on Twitter, which is not exactly good news for Kevin Durant although we haven\u2019t heard from actual medical staff, just the doctors on Twitter. Warriors 48-37 Raptors, 7:04, 2nd quarter Boogie is getting down now. This time around, it\u2019s with his passing, he finds Draymond Green for an assist. Toronto takes a timeout. Warriors 46-37 Raptors, 7:26, 2nd quarter And a three-pointer! My stars, this is exactly the lift that the Warriors need here. Siakam, however, puts an end to that Golden State run with a layup. Warriors 43-35 Raptors, 8:42, 2nd quarter Ibaka is on the line, having gotten fouled by Shaun Livingston. He makes one of two free throws. Cousins, coming in the game with Durant out. He makes two straight baskets. Warriors 39-34 Raptors, 9:46, 2nd quarter Lowry makes his first basket of the game. On the next play, Durant hits the floor on the same leg that was injured. That\u2019s just a brutal, brutal turn for the Warriors considering how well he had been playing to start the game. The Raptors fans cheer, which is not a very good look, and the Warriors take a necessary timeout. Warriors 39-32, Raptors 10:12, 2nd quarter Thompson hits the Warriors\u2019 eighth three-pointer and the Warriors are definitely playing Warriors basketball again. It definitely feels like just the availability of Durant has given them a spark as far as confidence. Bogut, as is his wont, fouls Ibaka and puts him on the line. He makes both of his free throws. Warriors 36-30 Raptors, 11:03, 2nd quarter Thompson with a tall jumper to start the scoring in the second. Lowry misses for Toronto but Ibaka gets the rebound and the basket. Warriors 34-28 Raptors, 11:39, 2nd quarter Durant misses the first shot of the second quarter. Andrew Bogut is in rather than DeMarcus Cousins, whose poor play in Game 4 has apparently shifted him deeper onto the bench. You\u2019re welcome. It\u2019s true that the victory will mean more if Durant plays at least one game. Of course, Warriors fans will always say \u201cif only we had KD for the entire series.\u201d Such is the nature of fandom. Warriors 34-28, end of the 1st quarter VanVleet gets two free throws for Toronto. On the other end, Iguodala finds Green for a miss but Curry manages to get the ball for the score. The Raptors can\u2019t get a final shot off and that\u2019ll do it for the first quarter. Warriors 32-26 Raptors, 31.5, 1st quarter Ibaka\u2019s time to foul. He puts Durant on the line where he makes both free throws AND he makes a huge three-pointers. Okay my prediction about his efficiency is not looking so hot. Warriors 27-26 Raptors, 1:56, 1st quarter Leonard gets to line, give the foul to Kevon Looney, he makes one of two free throws. Draymond gets called for a foul next, sort of a ticky-tack call this, he puts the Game 4 hero Serge Ibaka on the line and Ibaka makes it a one-point game. Warriors 27-23 Raptors, 2:45, 1st quarter A foul on Fred VanVleet gives the ball to the Warriors and a wide-open Draymond Green makes the Warriors\u2019 sixth three-pointer. Warriors 24-23 Raptors, 3:33, 1st quarter You\u2019ll never believe this but Curry made his third free throw as well. Durant is back in. Warriors 23-23 Raptors, 3:33, 1st quarter This feels very different than the brick-fest we got last game. After Pascal Siakam scores to briefly give the Raptors the lead, Curry gets fouled on the three-point line. He makes his first two free throws before the Raptors take their first timeout of the game. Warriors 21-21 Raptors, 4:36, 1st quarter Kawhi Leonard has been activated, he gets to the basket and he gets fouled. With the free throw make, he ties up the game. Durant, meanwhile, is out of the game, with Shaun Livingston playing for him. Gasol briefly gives the Raptors a lead but Steph Curry promptly ties it. Warriors 19-16 Raptors, 6:48, 1st quarter Danny Green promptly makes it a one-possession game. Warriors 19-14 Raptors, 6:48, 1st quarter Gasol makes the second of his two free throws out of the timeout. Warriors 19-12 Raptors, 7:11, 1st quarter Thompson fouls Gasol, who picks up his first free throw. With that, the Warriors take their first timeout. Warriors 19-12 Raptors, 7:23, 1st quarter Leonard tips in his own blocked shot to cut down the Warriors lead buy Draymond Green finds Curry for an easy layup. Danny Green scores on the other end. The Warriors can\u2019t miss however, Klay Thompson drills a three-pointer. And Siakam gets his first basket of the night. This is some great offense. Thompson makes the Warriors\u2019 fifth-consecutive three-pointer. Warriors 11-6 Raptors, 9:37, 1st quarter Durant then picks up his first foul, putting Gasol on the line. He makes one of two free throws, but the Raptors handle the rebound and Gasol hits a three pointer. Well that could have gone better for Golden State. And Kevin Durant answers with a three. Well then, maybe there\u2019s no rust. Warriors 8-2 Raptors, 10:02, 1st quarter Curry with a layup. Kevin Durant with a three pointer. Warriors coming out strong. Warriors 3-2 Raptors, 11:08, 1st quarter Raptors get the ball to start things off but get called for travelling. Curry hits a three on the other end for the first scoring play of the game. Gasol scores on the other end as a counter. Warriors 0-0 Raptors, 12:00, 1st quarter And, for the possible final time this season, we\u2019re off! Toronto Raptors starters Kyle Lowry \u2013 G Danny Green \u2013 G Kawhi Leonard \u2013 F Pascal Siakam \u2013 f Marc Gasol - C Golden State Warriors starters Warriors playing Draymond Green at the center position with Durant back.

That\u2019s absolutely appealing to my particular age group. I think she did a remarkable job. As far as \u201cO Canada,\u201d Toronto has brought in Doug Tranquada, the Raptors\u2019 traditional singer, comes in and starts the anthem and the rest of the crowd jumps in to finish it to remarkable effect. Email from Mila Pili: Why do we have to predict? Just watch and see what happens, almost time. This is probably the most sensible approach to watching sports. I, of course, reject the entire concept of watching sports as a reasonable person, but I respect the position. Email from Robbie Mulvena: Greetings from New Zealand Hunter Us Kiwis love our Basketball, and I Am completely Blown away every year at the level of play on display in the NBA, But having been an OKC Fan and going through the heartbreak of losing KD to the warriors who he lost too In the WCF, I can only hope Kawhi and the Raptors disrupt his three peat hopes Toronto Baby! I\u2019m starting to think that the Raptors are the sentimental favorites here. Just maybe. NBA Countdown is on and I\u2019m now reminded that Paul Pierce had the Raptors winning. Now, there\u2019s a good chance that he was completely right. There might be some sort of apocalyptic event coming. Just a head\u2019s up. Okay, I will admit Durant looks pretty okay here. Maybe he\u2019ll prove me wrong. Email from Peter Oh: Hi Hunter, Greetings from California. Full disclosure: I want the Warriors to win. Pet peeve: Toronto\u2019s \u201cWe the North\u201d rallying cry. I get that Canada is to the north of the US, but looking at a world map it\u2019s clear to see that Toronto is in the extreme south of Canada, so \u201cWe the North\u201d is a bit rich, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019d be like a London team facing a Paris team in a final, and the London fans claiming We the North. What would the folks in Liverpool and Newcastle (never mind in Scotland) say?! This is a wonderfully petty reason to root against a team and I am 100% for it. Predictions Alright let\u2019s get this over with. I thought the Warriors would definitely tie this series up in Friday\u2019s Game 4. That, clearly, didn\u2019t happen. It\u2019s obvious that without Durant in the lineup, Golden State is just a different team. If the Raptors didn\u2019t go on two long scoring droughts in Game 2, to start the second half and down the stretch in the fourth quarter, this one could already be over. The question is whether or not Durant will have enough to make much of a difference. I don\u2019t think he will, it\u2019s just too much to ask from him after such a long time on the shelf. I think this one\u2019s over and the Raptors manage to pull off a win. Now, I always am hoping for a long, competitive Finals so I hope that I\u2019m wrong here. If you have your own take on tonight, please feel free to send your prediction on how things will go tonight, either via email (the address is hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com) or tweet them (to @HunterFelt). Email from Damian Burns: Alright Hunter, on the tarmac at Montreal Airport on a flight to Toronto and onward to Dublin for a family wedding, but with a 3 hour layover from 9pm in Toronto. All seemed perfect, watching the game in Toronto before flying on. Pilot\u2019s just announced we have an hour delay. Gutted. I think this was an Alanis Morissette lyric, which I guess is appropriate since the game is in Canada. Obviously the story of the game is going to be Kevin Durant. According to Warriors head coach Steve Kerr, he looked fine at workouts and they don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a risk: \u201cHe responded well and, yeah, he\u2019s going to play.\u201d He will be starting and will be without a minutes restriction. It\u2019s safe to say Raptors are a little excited about being one victory away from the NBA title. And basketball fever extends far beyond Toronto. Preamble Is this the end of the Warriors dynasty? That\u2019s the question here in Game 5 of the NBA Finals between the Golden State Warriors and the Toronto Raptors. With their Game 4 win at Oracle Arena, the Raptors took a commanding 3-1 lead in the series and now the game returns to Toronto\u2019s Scotiabank Arena for what could be the final game of the NBA season and a symbolic conclusion to the Warriors\u2019 reign as the league\u2019s unstoppable juggernaut. To put things in the starkest terms possible, the Warriors would need to win three straight (starting today) in order to pull off a comeback. which funnily enough means they have to take inspiration from the last team who did that: LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers, who pulled off that feat against (you guessed it) the Golden State Warriors in 2016. In the role of James might be Kevin Durant, who has been out for weeks with a calf injury but will attempt to play today. It\u2019s good news for Golden State, but there\u2019s a very real concern about how much they can expect from Durant given that he\u2019s coming back from a serious injury and is immediately being thrown into a literal must-win game. Meanwhile, the Raptors will be battling in front of a home crowd with the perfect opportunity to win their first championship. In fact, they\u2019re playing for an entire country, as no Canadian team has ever won an NBA championship (the Grizzlies didn\u2019t spend enough time in Vancouver to get a decent shot). The beyond stoic Kawhi Leonard, who may be headed towards an entirely different team this offseason, has a chance to finalize a playoff performance of the ages here if the Raptors manage to end this in the next couple of hours. They certainly don\u2019t want to let the Warriors back into the series. The next game would be back at Oracle Arena for a final game in that venue\u2019s history and then would come a Game 7 where anything can happen. So, shortly we will get be celebrating a Raptors championship or the start of a memorable Warriors comeback. That sounds like it will be fun no matter. If you want to contribute to the liveblog feel free to send your thoughts here either via email (to hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com or tweet them here (to @HunterFelt) and we\u2019ll include them along the way. We will have Opening Tip some time after 9:00pm EST, but we\u2019ll be back well before then. It\u2019s Game 5 of the NBA Finals between the Golden State Warriors and the Toronto Raptors at Scotiabank Arena! Hunter will be here shortly. In the meantime, here\u2019s how Toronto has been handling the NBA finals: When Fitriya Hussein was given free tickets to a Toronto Raptorsbasketball game years ago in middle school, she was drawn in by the intensity of play; the strategy, speed and excitement. She instantly became a fan. But with that mantle came years of heartbreak, disappointment and frustration that sports fans around the world know all too well. Now, after Friday\u2019s victory over the reigning champion Golden State Warriors in the NBA finals, the Raptors are a single win away from their first-ever championship. And basketball fans in Toronto are experiencing a feeling that has been absent for more than two decades: hope.
