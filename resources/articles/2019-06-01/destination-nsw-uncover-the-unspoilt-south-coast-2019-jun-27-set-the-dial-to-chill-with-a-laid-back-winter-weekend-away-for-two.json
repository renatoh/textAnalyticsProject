Tucked into the coastline, off the main highways, is a string of beachside villages and tiny towns from Berry all the way to North Durras. Days feel laid-back down on this coast, but there\u2019s so much to do, see and eat. We asked Cunjurong Point local and photographer Marcus Clinton for his recommendations on the best this idyllic coastal stretch has to offer. DAY 1 Hampden Bridge, Kangaroo Valley 8am Leave Sydney early and drive south via the inland route (M31) through Kangaroo Valley next to Morton National Park. 10am Pick up coffee and a snack to go from Hampden Deli, Dining &amp; School. The menu changes daily and everything is made in-house using seasonal produce. If you\u2019re ready to stretch your legs, head over to Fitzroy Falls for bushwalking and birdwatching. 1pm Drive the country roads to Berry for lunch at the Berry Sourdough Bakery. This should be a stop on any road trip south. Specialising in sourdough bread and European pastries, the bakery also sells local produce, good coffee and kombucha on tap. The croque monsieur is a decadent option, filed with layers of smoked ham and oozing with hollandaise sauce. Leave with a loaf of sourdough bread. Pick up some cinnamon doughnuts from the Famous Berry Donut Van for afternoon tea. You won\u2019t regret it. 3pm In the afternoon, walk to the Cape St George Lighthouse ruins at Jervis Bay. The lookout has sea and cliff views and is a great place to watch the whale migration from May to November. 4.30pm Check in to your accommodation at Bannisters by the Sea, a boutique clifftop hotel overlooking Mollymook Beach. This once-tired coastal motel has been turned into a chic beachside 34-room hotel with white walls, palm trees and private balconies. 5pm Read a book on the deck or have a drink at the bar and settle in. 7pm Dinner at South Coast favourite, St Isidore. Clinton highly recommends dining here. \u201cIt\u2019s our favourite restaurant in the area,\u201d he says. Chef Alex Delly previously worked under notable chefs such as Teage Ezard, Andrew McConnnell and Rick Stein. St Isidore sits on rolling dairy pastures, and uses fresh produce from its own kitchen garden. \u201cPretty much everything else on the menu is made in-house or found locally,\u201d Clinton says. This includes the pork neck, the baby turnips and the sea urchin butter that you spread on your bread. Day 2 Huskisson Markets 7am Get up early for a surf at Mollymook, depending on the swell. \u201cThis coast is full of great surf spots,\u201d Clinton says. \u201cCheck the weather report and take your pick.\u201d For a surf lesson, check out Pam Burridge\u2019s Surf School, run by the Australian former world champion. 9am After a splash, refuel with breakfast and coffee at Brown Sugar in Milton. 10am Visit the Milton Produce Market (Saturdays mornings) to get a taste of local veggies, fruit, bread, preserves, cakes and more. While you\u2019re in Milton, have a look at its gorgeous boutiques and homewares shops. You\u2019ll find something for the senses at Essence of Milton, luxe homewares and linens at Spaces2538, and antiques and 20th-century furniture at Revival (often a goldmine for recycled and rare secondhand furniture). 12pm Head back to your hotel for lunch at Rick Stein at Bannisters. Seafood is a focus - think oysters from Pambula, prawns from Lake Illawarra and red snapper from right here in Mollymook - and best enjoyed with a salty ocean breeze from the outdoor balcony tables. 2pm Grab some good walking shoes for a hike up Pigeon House Mountain, 720 metres up the Budawang Range in Morton National Park. The ladders to the summit have recently been updated on this popular 5km hike, and autumn and winter is the best time to visit this wilderness area. 6.30pm After all that activity, you\u2019ll be ready for a drink. \u201cStop in to Harvest Bar in Milton before dinner,\u201d Clinton says. \u201cIt\u2019s a great vibe.\u201d Sit up at the bar, order a dark and stormy, and listen to live music on Friday and Saturday nights. Harvest also has a mobile bar in a caravan called Harvey that travels to festivals and events on the South Coast. 7.30pm Dinner is at Tallwood Eatery down the road in Mollymook. Food here is made with mostly local produce. \u201cCurrently, on Mondays they do chef\u2019s choice, $45 per head for three courses,\u201d Clinton says. \u201cTurn up and they cook for you, no menu, it\u2019s great.\u201d Day 3 Adnate artwork on Shoalhaven library 9am Sleep in before breakfast at Pilgrims Vegetarian Cafe in Milton. Then head to the inlet at Narrawallee, and hire a stand-up paddleboard from Adrian at Coastal Paddle Surf. 1pm Next stop is for lunch at Milk Haus, a cafe set up in an old cheese factory, which grows its own produce and makes clean, nourishing food. \u201cMy wife is a vegan and we go here a lot,\u201d Clinton says. 3pm Drive back through Nowra and take a self-guided walking tour of the outdoor murals painted on the sides of buildings and down laneways. Large-scale artworks by street artists including the world-renowned Adnate are a tribute to the Shoalhaven community. Subjects include artist Arthur Boyd, Aboriginal child and a black cockatoo (\u201cNowra\u201d is an Aboriginal word for black cockatoo). You\u2019ll find seven murals dotted throughout town. On the way back to Sydney, drive the coastal road across the iconic Sea Cliff Bridge between the towns of Clifton and Coalcliff.
