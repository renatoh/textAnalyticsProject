It marks the first live music broadcast on Radio 3 since 16 March. Twenty hour-long concerts featuring soloists or duos will take place at 1pm each weekday throughout June and will be livestreamed on the venue\u2019s website and broadcast on Radio 3 and BBC Sounds, part of the BBC\u2019s Culture in Quarantine initiative. All concerts will then be available on demand for 30 days. The musicians will perform to an empty hall, with a minimal technical set-up. The Wigmore Hall has a well established livestream programme and an existing partnership with Radio 3, which broadcasts the venue\u2019s Monday lunchtime concerts. \u201cWhen we shut the hall on 16 March we made sure to leave the piano on the stage, and the camera and audio equipment \u2013 all of which can be operated remotely \u2013 in place,\u201d said the venue\u2019s artistic director, John Gilhooly. \u201cWith only one or two performers on stage it\u2019s very possible to make this work within government guidelines observing social distancing. There\u2019ll be one producer backstage for Wigmore Hall, one producer for Radio 3, we need someone to tune and then anti-viral the piano, the artists will come on stage from separate entrances, the presenter will sit in the middle of the hall, I will sit in the balcony and we\u2019ll communicate via radio, email and texts.\u201d Extra constraints have come into play in terms of the choice of musicians. All the performers live in or near London, and most have pledged to travel to the venue either on foot or by bicycle, says Gilhooly. \u201cWe are lucky that the level of international musicians living in central London is phenomenal.\u201d He said the move represented a \u201cglimmer of hope\u201d. Performers include singers Iestyn Davies and Roderick Williams, as well as pianists Benjamin Grosvenor, Angela Hewitt and Paul Lewis. Mark Padmore and Mitsuko Uchida end the series with Schubert\u2019s song cycle Winterreise. Pianist Stephen Hough begins it on 1 June with the Bach-Busoni Chaconne and the Schumann Fantasie. \u201cI am honoured and delighted,\u201d he said, \u201calthough I am slightly anxious about how it will feel to leave the house and \u2018go to work\u2019 again. It seems an age since I stood in the wings, preparing to walk towards a piano.\u201d \u201cLive music is in the DNA of Radio 3. Its loss is felt by all, not just at home but also in the music industry. It is a great joy to restore this service to the nation while also ensuring maximum health and safety,\u201d said Alan Davey, controller of BBC Radio 3 and classical music. Just as Myra Hess\u2019s concerts at the National Gallery played such an important part in boosting morale during the second world war, Davey hopes the concerts will help those craving the sense of human connection between artist and audience and the excitement that live performance brings in a time when theatres, galleries, cinemas and concert halls have again been forced to close. He would like to be able to expand the initiative to other venues across the UK later in the year. \u201cIt\u2019s early days, but discussions are ongoing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know where we\u2019ll be or what activity will be allowed but the classical industry is creative and resourceful. We all have to find ways of reaching our audience and of continuing to make a living. It\u2019s important to keep things going.\u201d The BBC\u2019s involvement in the June series allows the expenditure to be shared, and, said Gilhooly, an anonymous donor has underwritten the Wigmore Hall\u2019s costs. But going forward, how to fund broadcastable quality live music-making without ticket sales is something there is no easy answer to, and the culture industry faces enormous challenges. \u201cThere\u2019s huge anxiety,\u201d said Gilhooly. \u201cEventually organisations will run out of cash. Some are already in serious trouble. There is no money in circulation at the moment. It\u2019s going to be very tough getting our balance sheets right again. Major investors have been hit badly. I don\u2019t think there will be as much sponsorship circulating in the months and years to come. \u201cThe Wigmore Hall is OK for now, but if this goes on past Christmas, I don\u2019t know. No one has any idea of how the rules and regulations are going to change, but none of us are going to come back from this 100% of what we were. This is uncharted territory. \u201cOne thing I do know is that it is unworkable to open venues to only small audiences. The Wigmore Hall will haemorrhage if we have 20% houses, plus how do you socially distance people in areas such as the foyer, the bars, or on the way to the toilets?\u201d Gilhooly laments the lack of official clarity. \u201cI wish at the outset the government had been clearer \u2013 it would be much better for them to have said, \u2018You must close until New Year\u2019s Eve,\u2019 and then we could have planned accordingly.\u201d Whether at Glastonbury, in a theatre, or at a football match, there\u2019s a magic around live performance, he added, that is also so important for mental health and wellbeing. \u201cThis is the first positive thing for the industry for many months. It\u2019s a glimmer of hope,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no substitute for hearing music live, even if the auditorium on this occasion will be empty, with only BBC microphones as audience,\u201d said Hough. \u201cThis may only be a poking of a head above the parapet for now, but it\u2019s a clear sign that we\u2019re back.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
