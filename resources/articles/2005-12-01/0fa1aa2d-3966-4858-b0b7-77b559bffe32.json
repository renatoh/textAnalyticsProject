Sushi, has announced the launch of its first two hotels, which it claims will be the only ones in the world to be located inside airports. Next summer, a 40-'cabin' hotel in Heathrow's Terminal 4 and a 50-cabin one in Gatwick's South Terminal will open. Eventually, Yotels will be rolled out in major airports, railway stations and city centres around the world, with a predicted 10-15 opening over the next five years, including one in central London in 2007. Standard room rates are \u00a380 a night, or \u00a340 for four hours. Economy rooms cost \u00a340 a night, or \u00a325 for four hours. The brand will go head to head with Stelios Haji-Ioannou's easyHotels, which launched its flagship property in London last summer with rooms from \u00a325 a night. Yotels will be located in the main retail area on the 'landside' of the airports, before passport control, so those without a boarding card can check in, and it is hoped they will prove popular with business and leisure travellers. City-centre hotels are expected to attract tourists and clubbers, though they won't be available for the four-hour periods to prevent them being used as 'knocking shops'. Proudly guiding me around the prototype model room in London this week, Simon Woodruffe, founder of the Yo! brand, explained how he hit upon his idea after being upgraded to business class on a flight. 'I lay in my flat bed and thought it would be great to make small capsule rooms for hotels too.' So he engaged the help of designers who had previously worked on business-class cabins for planes and the result is a futuristic, yet incredibly comfortable and practical interior, aesthetically much more pleasing than the plastic orange decor of the easyHotels. Flat screen TVs, large-headed 'monsoon' showers, leather fittings and high-quality towels and sheets all warrant the luxury title, but the hotels will be able to keep their room rates low by building them small. To maximise space, storage shelves, mirrors, a safe and desk all fold away or are hidden, and the rotating bed can be pulled out from the wall and swivelled to give easier access. Though they do have external window boxes with real grass, the windows have a claustrophobia-inducing view onto corridors rather than the outside world. 'If you asked a market research group if they'd like to stay in a 10 square metre room with no natural daylight they'd say no, but show them this and they would,' says Woodruffe."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
