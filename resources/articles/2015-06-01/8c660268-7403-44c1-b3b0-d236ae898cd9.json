Both companies faced criminal investigations by the Serious Fraud Office over allegations of overcharging that led to them repaying nearly \u00a3180m. The continuing monthly payments to the two companies were uncovered by an analysis of Ministry of Justice (MoJ) data by the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies which shows that G4S was paid a total of \u00a38.7m between March 2014 \u2013 when it lost the tagging contract \u2013 and February 2015. Serco was paid \u00a34.5m over the same period. The electronic monitoring tags are used to enforce curfews on more than 100,000 offenders each year. The outsourcing giant Capita took over the contract on an interim basis in April last year. In July 2014, Capita and three other companies were named as the winners of a \u00a3265m six-year contract to supply the next generation of satellite tracking tags, which would allow dangerous and repeat offenders to be monitored around the clock. The MoJ agreed that Capita should continue to use the older G4S/Serco tagging equipment until the first satellite tracking tags were due to come into use by the end of last year. But there have been continued delays in the development of the satellite tracking tags and the contracts with G4S and Serco to use their equipment have been extended. The Guardian understands that they were given a 15-month extension earlier this year with a further extension possible when that expires in 2016. Richard Garside of the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies said: \u201cThe ministry is continuing to pay G4S and Serco for the supply of electronic tagging equipment months after the contracts should have been terminated, because the timetable for the next generation of satellite tagging technology has slipped and slipped. \u201cThe ministry needs to clarify, as soon as possible, when payments to G4S and Serco will end.\u201d Garside claimed that the MoJ had originally published inaccurate data showing that the two companies had been paid a total of \u00a332m but had since clarified the figure as being \u00a313.2m. An MoJ spokeswoman said: \u201cG4S and Serco no longer deliver electronic monitoring services. We have always been clear Capita would continue to use their systems until new tags were developed, which gave taxpayers value for money and put public safety first.\u201d She said that the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies\u2019 original interpretation of the MoJ data had been incorrect as the bulk of the reported \u00a332m that had been spent had been for the period in 2013 and 2014 when G4S and Serco still held the tagging contract. The former justice secretary, Chris Grayling, announced in July last year that a small Redditch company, Steatite, would supply the new generation of satellite GPS tracking tags. They in turn sub-contracted to a Taiwanese company, Sanav. But it is understood that the first Steatite tags were rushed into use last year in an attempt to meet Grayling\u2019s end-of-year deadline, but had to be withdrawn amid a dispute over intellectual property rights and other issues. The tags may not be ready until 2016 or later. G4S runs the largest current satellite tracking programme in the world in France where it tracks the daily movements of 12,000 offenders. A G4S spokesman said: \u201cOur GPS-enabled electronic monitoring technology is a world-leader \u2013 designed, developed and exported from our base in Leicester to 17 countries around the world \u2013 and we will continue to support the ministry of justice in England and Wales in any way we can.\u201d This article was amended on 25 June 2015 to make it clear that Steatite, not Capita, was responsible for the delays in the development of the satellite tags."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
