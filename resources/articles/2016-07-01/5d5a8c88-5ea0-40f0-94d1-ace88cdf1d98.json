Dana Schwartz, an entertainment writer at the Observer, wrote \u201cAn Open Letter to Jared Kushner, From One of Your Jewish Employees\u201d on Tuesday. The Observer is a New York City-based paper that Kushner, the billionaire scion of a real estate family, bought in 2006. Schwartz writes that she became a target of antisemitic hate speech after she took issue with a Trump tweet posted Saturday that included an image that Paul Ryan, the House speaker, on Tuesday called \u201cantisemitic\u201d. Schwartz challenges Kushner as a fellow Jewish member of the media to face what is happening in the barely concealed underbelly of his father-in-law\u2019s campaign. \u201cI\u2019m asking you, not as a \u2018gotcha\u2019 journalist or as a liberal but as a human being: how do you allow this?\u201d writes Schwartz: Because, Mr Kushner, you are allowing this ... But when you stand silent and smiling in the background, his Jewish son-in-law, you\u2019re giving his most hateful supporters tacit approval. Because maybe Donald Trump isn\u2019t anti-Semitic. To be perfectly honest, I don\u2019t think he is. But I know many of his supporters are, and they believe for whatever reason that Trump is the candidate for them. Trump\u2019s eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, converted to Judaism to marry Kushner in 2009. Kushner has played an increasingly high-profile role in Trump\u2019s campaign, participating at a high level in the decision last month to fire the former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, among other decisions. Kushner responded to the letter in a statement late Tuesday. \u201cMy father-in-law is an incredibly loving and tolerant person who has embraced my family and our Judaism since I began dating my wife,\u201d the statement said. \u201cI know that Donald does not at all subscribe to any racist or anti-semitic thinking. I have personally seen him embrace people of all racial and religious backgrounds. The suggestion that he may be intolerant is not reflective of the Donald Trump I know.\u201d The controversy began when Trump tweeted an image of Clinton with a rain of cash behind her and the words \u201cmost corrupt candidate ever\u201d inside a six-pointed star. A short time later, the tweet was deleted and reposted with a circle replacing the star. Though the original image was deleted, Trump did not apologize for it, or admit that it was derogatory, instead claiming that the star was a \u201csheriff\u2019s star, or plain star\u201d. The Trump campaign\u2019s social media director, Dan Scavino, also tried his hand at cleaning up the mess, saying that he had lifted the image from an online source but it wasn\u2019t hate speech and he would never offend anyone. (The image in Trump\u2019s original tweet was traced by Mic to a white supremacist message board.) The explanations, wrote Schwartz in her public letter, were \u201cinane\u201d and \u201ccondescending\u201d. \u201cLook at that image and tell me, honestly, that you just saw a \u2018Sheriff\u2019s star,\u2019\u201d writes Schwartz. \u201cI didn\u2019t see a sheriff star, Mr. Kushner, and I\u2019m a smart person. After all, I work for your paper.\u201d She continued: The worst people in this country saw your father-in-law\u2019s message and took it as they saw fit. And yet Donald Trump in his response chose not to condemn them, the anti-Semites who, by his argument were obviously misinterpreting the image, but the media. In the letter, Schwartz shares screen grabs of antisemitic hate speech that confronted her after she objected to the image online. They referred to ovens, invited Schwartz to kill herself, and used images of Anne Frank and other Jewish caricatures. Schwartz notes that Trump\u2019s campaign has a way of attracting \u201chateful individuals\u201d, and challenges Kushner to imagine his own family as the target: Mr. Kushner, I invite you to look through all of those images in the slideshow above, the vast majority sent in your father-in-law\u2019s name. Right now, this hate is directed to one of your employees, but the message applies equally to your wife and daughter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
