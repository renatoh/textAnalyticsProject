In the drizzle, a grey wagtail appears on next door's roof. I've not seen one of these there since last autumn. Is it the same one and is this group of roofs and gardens the winter home of a solitary grey wagtail? Unlike its pied wagtail cousins, which have adapted so well to car parks and roost communally at this time of year, the grey wagtail is usually a bird of mountain streams. This one probably came from the brook that runs north from the Priory through fields and down the wooded Farley Dingle to the Severn. It seems perfectly at home here, hunting for insects over roof tiles and along gutters, making the most of any sun-warmed surfaces. All the time the wagtail lives up to its name with a constant, neurotic bobbing of its long tail feathers and back end, a pent-up dynamo of a bird. But it is the colour of the bird's plumage that is so striking: grey on top and lemon-yellow underneath. It is only at day's end that these colours suddenly and magnificently chime with the colours of the landscape. In the hour before dusk, the sky turns dark grey as squally weather moves in. The setting sun is brilliant and casts a fine golden glow which ignites the trees. The most glorious are poplars, burning like tall yellow flames against the dark sky wall. Above the green and gold trees of the rookery, rooks drift languidly, playing in the light, flipping their wings so the sun strikes their shiny, iridescent blackness and flashes silver. High above the birds, embedded in dark clouds, is the fragment of a rainbow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
