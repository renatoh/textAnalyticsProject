After the debacle that was Steam comes World of Warcraft. The game launched in Europe today and I've been trying to create an account for the last 5 hours - with no joy. The US launch was the most successful MMORPG launch ever. Unfortunately the developers Blizzard underestimated how popular their game would be and how busy the servers would get, resulting in severe lag and registration problems. Surely they wouldn't make the same mistake in Europe? 'Fraid so. The reviews and a play on the beta suggest the hassle will be worth it, but it is nonsense like this that helps keep online gaming in a ghetto. Sunday night update - got in late Friday and have played hours since. Highly addictive and worth the hassle."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
