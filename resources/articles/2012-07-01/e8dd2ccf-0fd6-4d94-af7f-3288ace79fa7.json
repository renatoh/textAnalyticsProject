Modric, who is determined to leave Tottenham Hotspur, has also attracted the interest of Paris St-Germain, who have made contact with his representatives, as well as Chelsea and Manchester United. The midfielder failed to force a move to Chelsea last summer, when Daniel Levy rejected a \u00a340m bid, and the Tottenham chairman has resolved not to sell to a Premier League rival. PSG would appear outsiders in the fight for Modric's signature as he has his heart set on Madrid. P\u00e9rez is attempting to finalise the structure of the fee, with the offer to Tottenham of performance-related add-ons, and he hopes that the total will come in below \u00a340m, which was the benchmark that Levy effectively set last summer. Levy, though, will sell only on his terms and, as history has shown, he is relaxed about going to the final moments of the transfer window to drive the hardest bargains, which could make for another tense summer for Modric. Tottenham's new manager, Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, has identified Porto's Jo\u00e3o Moutinho as his priority midfield target and reports in Portugal have said that the club have turned down an offer of \u20ac20m. Porto would want \u20ac30m."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
