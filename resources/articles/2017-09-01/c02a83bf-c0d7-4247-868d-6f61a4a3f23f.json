The company, founded by two former Google employees and launched on Wednesday, is marketing five-foot-wide pantries that users can unlock with their smartphones to pick up non-perishable items. There are no humans at the \u201cstores\u201d \u2013 which are already stationed in spots like apartment buildings, offices and gyms \u2013 and a computer program automatically charges customers\u2019 credit cards, according to Fast Company, which first reported on the startup. Although the boxes appear to be little more than glorified vending machines, the company\u2019s executives have been widely mocked, and criticized for explicitly stating that their mission is to displace neighborhood corner stores and put family-owned shops out of business. \u201cThe vision here is much bigger than the box itself,\u201d co-founder Paul McDonald, a former Google product manager, told Fast Company. \u201cEventually, centralized shopping locations won\u2019t be necessary, because there will be 100,000 Bodegas spread out, with one always 100 ft away from you.\u201d McDonald backtracked on Wednesday, claiming in a blogpost that he is not trying to put bodegas out of business despite his earlier statements to the contrary: \u201cChallenging the urban corner store is not and has never been our goal.\u201d The goal of disrupting a long-running industry and eliminating human interaction from the process of shopping at a convenience store is embedded in the roundly ridiculed Bodega name, which appropriates a commonly used term in the US for corner stores typically run by immigrants. \u201cIt\u2019s sacrilegious to use that name, and we\u2019re going to do whatever we need to do to fight this,\u201d Frank Garcia, chair of the New York State Coalition of Hispanic Chambers of Commerce, told the Guardian. \u201cIt was devastating to find out \u2026 and it\u2019s not fair to the local bodegas now that don\u2019t have the angel investors that these guys have.\u201d McDonald and co-founder Ashwath Rajan have secured funding from high-profile players in the tech industry, including investors from First Round Capital, Forerunner Ventures and Homebrew and senior executives at Facebook, Google, Twitter and Dropbox, Fast Company reported. Garcia said his grandfather was the head of the Latin Grocery Association in the 1960s and helped coin the term \u201cbodega\u201d, a name widely used for stores in New York City today. \u201cIt\u2019s his legacy and the legacy of these immigrants who came here with nothing to start a little grocery store, and came up with a concept to really help the community against racism,\u201d he said, noting that existing grocers often would refuse to serve Puerto Ricans. \u201cDon\u2019t use our community to make a fast buck.\u201d McDonald claimed that the company conducted surveys in the \u201cLatin American community to understand if they felt the name was a misappropriation of that term or had negative connotations\u201d and alleged that 97% said no. Bodega did not respond to an interview request and did not answer questions about the nature of the survey and how much funding the startup has raised. In his blogpost, McDonald praised existing bodegas as \u201cfixtures of their neighborhoods for generations\u201d that \u201cstock thousands of items, far more than we could ever fit on a few shelves\u201d. He also said he was surprised by the social media outrage about the name, offering an apology \u201cto anyone we\u2019ve offended\u201d. \u201cRather than disrespect to traditional corner stores \u2013 or worse yet, a threat \u2013 we intended only admiration.\u201d He did not respond to a question about whether he was reconsidering the name. Critics have also condemned Bodega as the latest example of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs attracting large sums of money to provide a service for which there is little demand, aimed at catering to a wealthy population. Juicero, a startup that raised $120m to sell $400 juicer machines that were revealed to be the equivalent of two hands squeezing a juice box, recently shut down. McDonald told Fast Company he was unveiling 50 new locations on the west coast and plans to spread across the country, with more than a thousand \u201cBodegas\u201d in place by the end of 2018. The boxes are supposed to use machine learning to assess which items are most in demand and adjust the supply accordingly, but some critics are already questioning whether the business model will be sustainable. Even if Bodega rapidly grows, many shoppers won\u2019t want to abandon their local stores, said Trisha Chakrabarti, senior program and policy manager at Mandela MarketPlace, a nonprofit that supports local grocery stores and is based in Oakland, California, where Bodega is headquartered. \u201cIt\u2019s about having neighbors in your community who know you, who have lived there and been in business for a long time, who have seen changes in the neighborhood and are responsive to customers needs,\u201d she said. \u201cThat kind of personalization of service, you will never be able to find with an automated service.\u201d Bodega is launching at a time when local bodegas are barely scraping by, said Chakrabarti. \u201cThese are marginalized business owners to begin with in places like Oakland, New York and San Francisco. Their businesses are threatened by ever increasing rents.\u201d She said she was particularly shocked to see the startup founders openly boasting about striving to wipe out this industry: \u201cI hope that they fail.\u201d In New York, where there are a large number of Yemeni-owned corner stores, some are known for using \u201chonor systems\u201d in which they let regular customers pay at a later date if they are low on cash and have immediate needs, said Debbie Almontaser, board president of the Muslim Community Network. \u201cThey work with communities when they don\u2019t have money, people living paycheck to paycheck that need milk and diapers,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of their customers are just so grateful that they have this kind of trust in them ... I can\u2019t imagine they would want to see these manufactured little kiosks in their communities.\u201d Garcia said his organization would explore any legal options it may have to challenge Bodega\u2019s name, adding that he hoped lawmakers would regulate this kind of business and not let the startup bypass government rules existing stores have to follow. He noted that even when 7-Eleven, the chain of convenience stores, has moved into neighborhoods with small businesses, executives have met with community leaders and representatives of bodegas. \u201cAt least they respected the community,\u201d he said. \u201cThese guys have not.\u201d At one residential skyscraper in San Francisco where a Bodega box is, tenant Nripesh Koirala said he would consider shopping from one since it\u2019s convenient, but that he didn\u2019t think the startup would threaten retail shops. \u201cIt\u2019s just their arrogance if they\u2019re saying they are going to replace stores,\u201d said Koirala, a 23-year-old student. \u201cAt a corner store, there are a lot of things you can choose from and you can ask them questions ... You can\u2019t talk to a vending machine.\u201d Contact the author: sam.levin@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
