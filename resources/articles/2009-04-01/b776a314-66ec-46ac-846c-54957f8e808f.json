(Though how you can have avoided getting the measure of one of TV's most irksome figures is a mystery.) To the classic example of the Likely Lads' attempt to avoid finding out the England score before the game was broadcast, we can now add Lovejoy's decision to ruin Jenson Button's victory in the Australian grand prix. By way of a quick recap, the BBC decided to rescreen the race at 1pm on Sunday so that some viewers \u2013 this one included \u2013 who hadn't been up at the crack of dawn could watch it as live. In such circumstances, of course, one avoids looking at the internet or any channel likely to be showing a news bulletin. Judging myself safe in the wilds of BBC2 (idiocy, admittedly), I switched on just after 10am, at the precise moment at which Tim Lovejoy, co-hosting a cookery show, said: \"We're not allowed to give the result away, because people want to watch it at 1pm. But \u2026 it's really good, so watch it. It seems so bizarre that we can't say what happened. Why would anyone not watch something live? Shall we give them the result now?\" And on it went. He was helping to make a pea and pancetta lasagne at the time \u2013 but the details are irrelevant. What sort of killjoy does this? What Tim Lovejoy doesn't understand \u2026 On second thoughts, that could be the opener for the longest paragraph in human history. Let's try again. One of the many things Tim Lovejoy doesn't understand is that even witless hinting ruins any sporting event one is desperately trying to see as live. It obviously, famously ruins it for anyone who hasn't seen it, and adds the square root of sod all to the experience of those who already have. Certain friends will erupt in fury should someone ask knowingly \"did you see the game?\" if they are hurrying back to watch their recording. You can't avoid becoming obsessed with the tone of voice in which the question was asked, the implication that it was worth seeing \u2013 it just sets the mind speculating in a manner which will significantly detract from the experience. It takes away the possibility that nothing very interesting might happen, the same possibility that throws all the good moments of sport into sharper, more glorious relief. Dull scoreless draws, Jarno Trulli winning \u2013 these could be your reward. Unless of course Tim Lovejoy or some other moron has effectively told you they won't be, in which case all you can think of is the certainty that something \"really good\" will happen. You're just waiting for it. Was that it, you might wonder of an early goal? That was probably it, you'd be thinking distractingly of Button's start. \"I'd like to know the result even if I was going to watch it,\" quacked on Lovejoy, a man who treats every Chelsea pre-season friendly as though it were the Rumble in the Jungle, yet remains serially blind to alternative viewpoints. \"I love it,\" was his bovine paean to the new England kit. \"Because I like new things.\" See also one of his mesmerisingly cretinous Twitter postings: \"I haven't read damned United [sic] as I don't read fiction.\" My friend Matthew will never get over a day in 1986, when Sugar Ray Leonard's monumentally anticipated comeback fight against Marvin Hagler was to be screened in the UK the evening after its early hours denouement in Vegas. He was determined to watch without knowing the result. He bunked off college and secluded himself at home, away from newsagents, and with the radio and TV lying silent. Late afternoon, he found himself so stir-crazy that he decided to risk a walk in the park, during which he came across two men shadow boxing and talking animatedly. Clamping his hands over his ears, he ran for it. But it wasn't enough to drown out the attentions of one of the men, who bellowed \"Leonard, by split decision\" at his departing back. \"It was just the sheer malevolence of it,\" he reflected yesterday. \"It was a very English moment, really. They knew exactly what I was doing and they wanted to ruin it for me.\" Was Lovejoy's modus operandi on Sunday just rank stupidity? Or was it simple malevolence, born of Partridgean bitterness about being relegated to co-hosting some dire cookery show at an unsociable hour on Sunday mornings, and a desire to take his frustrations out on licence fee payers? Something of a split decision in itself, perhaps."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
