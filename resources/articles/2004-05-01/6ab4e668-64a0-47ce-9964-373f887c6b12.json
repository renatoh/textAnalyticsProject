Michael Howard, who rightly raised the issue of Labour's central controls, promised the Conservatives would free local councils from Whitehall red tape and hand power back to the people. He conveniently ignored the uncomfortable facts that in their 18 years in office, the Tories tightened central reins, capped local authority revenue-raising powers, and surrendered \u00a330bn worth of public services to unelected quangos. Tony Blair conveniently ignored the 60% rise in council-tax bills, though the root cause of this rise - the small proportion of total income that local councils are allowed to raise - could be rectified by Labour's current review of local government finance. Ironically, although it should reduce central funding (along with central taxation) it would lead to higher local taxes. Beneath the competing rhetoric, there is a more fundamental problem. How do you measure productivity in the public sector? Oliver Letwin, the shadow chancellor, who received a leaked memo from a March cabinet meeting chaired by the prime minister, has accused ministers of leaning on Whitehall's statisticians to prove that the extra tax billions now being spent are delivering better services and are not being wasted. Despite a rebuttal from Sir Andrew Turnbull, the cabinet secretary, that allegations of ministerial meddling were \"untrue and deeply unhelpful\", Mr Letwin has refused to back down. Certainly current yardsticks show a fall in productivity in public services. But it is not just ministers but senior civil servants too who are concerned by the current inadequate measuring methods. A nineteen-fold increase in the use of statins, a lipid-reducing drug that has saved thousands of lives by preventing strokes and heart attacks, is not recorded as an NHS productivity gain. Fewer crimes has meant fewer arrests, which has meant lower police productivity. Higher teacher-pupil ratios in primary schools has meant lower productivity. Ministers were right last year to appoint Sir Tony Atkinson, warden of Nuffield College, Oxford and an international authority in the field, to conduct an independent review of current measures. Meanwhile, Conservative assertions that public services have not improved - or even been reformed - should be regarded as short-sighted refusal to accept that big investments have big gains."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
