At the beginning of June he was under arrest accused of attempting to mount a coup against President Charles Tayor. Just over two months later he is to succeed him. His rise to the top of the government is the result of the heavily negotiated terms and conditions under which Mr Taylor - who virtually no one wanted to remain in office - agreed to resign. But it is not an especially great promotion for the 56-year-old: the Liberian government has lost most of Liberia to rebel militias and Mr Blah will, in effect, be president of the government-held areas of the capital. One of the old guard, he will inevitably be associated with a regime that exported war and is blamed for much of the chaos in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Ivory Coast. He also shares much of his past with the man he succeeds - the two trained in Libyan guerrilla camps in the 1980s before Mr Taylor launched his 1989 rebellion against then president Samuel Doe. After a six-year civil war, which saw Mr Blah gain the reputation of a feared general, Mr Taylor was elected president in 1997. One campaign slogan ran \"He killed my Ma, he killed my Pa, but I will vote for him.\" The death of Mr Taylor's first vice-president, Enoch Dogolea, in 2000 saw Mr Blah return from being ambassador to Libya to take the job. As vice-president, he ditched his general's uniform in favour of African robes and drove himself around in a jeep rather than travelling in motorcades. He has spoken of his wish for exiles to return to rebuild the shattered country and suggested a new start can be made. \"Let bygones be bygones. If there is power, we can share it,\" he recently told the Associated Press. Mr Blah's arrest this summer apart, the present and previous presidents are considered firm allies. Their split, which now appears to have healed, came on Mr Taylor's return from peace talks in Ghana. He fled home after the UN special court in Sierra Leone indicted him for war crimes to accuse Mr Blah and 30 other senior government figures of conspiring with the US to oust him. Some tensions may remain but the closeness between the two men presents a problem for the leaders of Liberia's two main rebel groups since Mr Blah is not the neutral candidate they want to see heading a transitional administration; some have accused him outright of being a proxy. Sekou Fofana, a senior member of Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy, the group who have made repeated assaults on the capital, was reported to have said that \"[They] are the same. If Blah takes over, we will fight back\". It is perhaps with such such statements in mind that the president of Ghana, John Kufuor, also chairman of the west African community Ecowas, attempted to limit political - and military - fallout from the appointment with his announcement today that Mr Blah will serve in office until an interim government is established in October. But only the events of the next weeks will determine if the departure of Mr Taylor and arrival of peacekeepers is, for now, enough to end the conflict in Liberia and start what will be its inevitably long recovery."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
