Anscombe appeared to have beaten Anthony Watson to the bounce in the 24th minute but Newman ruled otherwise to deny Wales a potential seven points. As the referee, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Garc\u00e8s, had been playing advantage, they had a penalty under the posts which Rhys Patchell kicked. It meant a potential loss of four points and England defeated them by six. \u201cI thought I had got the ball down, but the decision didn\u2019t go our way,\u201d said Anscombe, who started the match as a late replacement for the injured Leigh Halfpenny at full-back and finished at fly-half. \u201cIt was disappointing because it could have changed the momentum, but it was early in the game and we had chances to fix it. \u201cThe TMOs do not always get it right, which is frustrating, but you cannot do much about it. We were confident when we saw the first replay and started jogging back to our own half. It would have been nice to have had my first Test try but it was not to be and ultimately we paid for a rough start.\u201d Warren Gatland, the Wales head coach, said of Newman\u2019s decision: \u201cI have not heard anyone say they agreed with him. He just made a bad call, didn\u2019t he? It will be interesting to chat with him to see what his explanation is. \u201cThe mood in the changing room after the match was not down at all. We were pleased at how strongly we finished the game, and considering we think we are 20\u201125% off being as fit and as sharp as we will be by the World Cup, we are in a pretty good place.\u201d Wales will have Liam Williams and George North, who came on as a second-half replacement, fit for selection for the match against Ireland in Dublin on 24 February. Their returns are timely with Halfpenny a doubt because of the foot infection he picked up two days before the match against England. Anscombe said: \u201cI knew I was playing on Friday morning. It was nerve-racking in the sense that I had not prepared for it, but I sat down with Leigh and knew what was expected. It was a rollercoaster 24 hours but it was good to get out there and try and have an impact on the game. We are disappointed not to have won, but we can be proud of the way we played in the second half.\u201d Wales conceded two tries in the opening 19 minutes when they tried to play an expansive game in wet conditions but Gatland did not put that down to barbs from his opposite number, England\u2019s Eddie Jones, in the buildup when he accused them of being cocky and questioned their experience and bottle. \u201cWe just laughed it off,\u201d he said. \u201cPlayers at this level have got to be prepared for that sort of stuff. It was a good experience for them. We probably tried to shift the ball a bit too much in the first half, but in the second the weather got better, some of their players started to tire and we opened up.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
