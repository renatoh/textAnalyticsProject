The Wallabies\u2019 influential back-row was unable to train on Monday and his chances of featuring at Twickenham remain in doubt \u2013 even if Eddie Jones says he has heard it all before. Pocock\u2019s absence would be a significant blow for Australia, who overcame Italy 26-7 last Saturday but are nearing the end of a trying year in which they have won only four of their 12 matches. The 30-year-old has enjoyed success against England in the past \u2013 he was an outstanding performer in their 2015 World Cup triumph at Twickenham \u2013 but the scrum-half Will Genia confirmed on Monday he is \u201cpretty busted\u201d. Neck injuries are seemingly an occupational hazard for Pocock, who sustained a similar problem against the All Blacks in August. That he was unable to play against South Africa two weeks later suggests he is up against it to make the seven-day turnaround but Australia will decide in the coming days whether he will face England. Jones, however, says he is paying little attention to the news. \u201cWe\u2019re not even thinking about it. I hear this every time we play Australia \u2013 Pocock\u2019s not going to be fit \u2013 so when I heard it I thought: \u2018Here we go again,\u2019\u201d the England coach said. \u201cYou know those merry-go-rounds? It\u2019s a bit like that.\u201d With or without Pocock, the Wallabies will seek to end a run of five straight losses to England, the most recent of which came at Twickenham a year ago when Jones\u2019s side triumphed 30-6 in a match far closer than the scoreline suggests. Owen Farrell was extra-effective that day, not least in convincing the referee, Ben O\u2019Keeffe, to disallow Marika Koroibete\u2019s second-half try when Australia trailed by seven points. Farrell\u2019s second-half performance against Japan on Saturday, when he came off the bench to steer England from a five-point deficit to 35-15 winners, has also not gone unnoticed by the Wallabies. \u201cHe\u2019s a world-class player and that\u2019s what you expect from someone like him,\u201d said Genia, who is in line for his 100th cap on Saturday. \u201cHe influences the game with his touches. He\u2019s pretty aggressive, he\u2019s in your face and likes getting stuck in. He\u2019s very physical \u2013 he can put a hit in \u2013 but he also manages the game really well. England will bring lots of physicality. That is a huge strength of theirs, they know their strengths and they play a winning brand of rugby. That\u2019s something I\u2019ve seen since [Eddie] has been involved.\u201d Jones repaid the compliment, revealing the role he played in Genia\u2019s development when he coached the Reds. \u201cI remember this fat little bloke in the academy and they said he doesn\u2019t work hard enough,\u201d said Jones, who gave Genia his Super Rugby debut in 2007. \u201cI remember a meeting with his dad [Kilroy], who was [a cabinet] minister for Papua New Guinea. I had a chat about what he needed to do and I never saw a boy work as hard as him. We didn\u2019t train Thursdays in those days but Will would always come up with a bag of balls and practise his box-kicking. It\u2019s a real tribute to him where he has got to and what a great player he has been for Australia.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
