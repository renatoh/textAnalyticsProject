The RBA document, released under freedom of information laws, contains a declarative statement from Bank officials: \u201cAny change which discourages negative gearing may be a good thing from an FS perspective,\u201d with FS standing for financial stability. It also warns: \u201cThe concessional rate of taxation of capital gains might encourage leverage speculation, particularly in combination with negative gearing provisions.\u201d The four-page document, which was posted on the RBA\u2019s website on 4 May, specifically addresses issues in the 2014 Financial System Inquiry, which released its final report in December 2014. But it also lists concerns about problems arising from the interaction between negative gearing and the 50% capital gains tax discount. It is unclear when those concerns were written. After news of the FoI release broke on Monday, the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, and the assistant treasurer, Kelly O\u2019Dwyer, were quick to dismiss it as an \u201cinternal memo\u201d that was two years old. Morrison repeated that line on Tuesday, saying the document did not represent the Reserve Bank\u2019s official position, and the warnings in the document are out of date. \u201cThis was a note, it\u2019s not official RBA advice,\u201d he said on Tuesday. He said the note shows what Reserve Bank officials were thinking in 2014 about the state of the housing market then. That was before the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (Apra) introduced measures to tighten bank lending standards to take some heat out of the housing market, he said. \u201cWhat the RBA said in 2014 was addressed by Apra and it worked, so I think frankly, it\u2019s out of date,\u201d he said. \u201cThe report was written almost two years ago in a very specific environment. What we\u2019re dealing with now I think, Phil Lowe, the deputy governor who I announced would be becoming governor later this year in September, in one of his most recent speeches was talking about the key issue on housing affordability was supply, and he\u2019s right. \u201cIf you want to deal with housing affordability issues we have to continue to deal with the issue of how supply is constrained. That is actually a more effective measure because you can deal with that in specific markets,\u201d he said. He acknowledged the RBA\u2019s concerns about negative gearing and capital gains tax were relevant in 2014. Morrison\u2019s comments come after the Economist magazine published an article on Australia\u2019s 2016 election campaign last week in which it labelled Australia\u2019s contemporary negative gearing policy \u201ccrazy\u201d. \u201cThe crazy practice of \u2018negative gearing\u2019, which allows investors in property to write nearly everything off against tax, has also helped push up prices beyond the reach of Australians in their 20s and 30s (many of whom, even if they are able to buy a property, still have to live with their parents to afford it),\u201d the magazine said. \u201cYet Mr Turnbull calls the idea of repealing negative gearing \u2018reckless\u2019, knowing that it would anger property-owners \u2013 and possibly alarm banks, heavily exposed to mortgages,\u201d it said. The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said on Tuesday that the RBA document could be added to the evidence that economists are concerned about Australia\u2019s housing policy settings. \u201cWherever you look, the evidence continually mounts up that Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s shrill scare campaign is based on myths and lies,\u201d Bowen said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the Reserve Bank in this internal memo making these points, you\u2019ve got the Economist magazine, not a left-leaning magazine, a very well-respected journal, calling Australia\u2019s negative gearing house settings \u2018crazy\u2019 and effectively endorsing calls for reform. You\u2019ve got the evidence from [the Committee for Economic Development of Australia], from the Grattan Institute. Everywhere you look, Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s scare campaign falls apart.\u201d Turnbull has warned that Labor\u2019s proposal to change negative gearing would deliver \u201ca reckless trifecta of lower home values, higher rents and less investment\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
