Earlier in the day one of the other three directors, Jon Woods, had thrown his support behind the chairman Bill Kenwright by declaring that their colleague Paul Gregg's plans for the future of the club were \"impractical and unworkable\". It leaves Gregg isolated and outvoted on the current board, the same people who form True Blue Holdings, the group set up by Kenwright to oust Peter Johnson back in 2000. Oxford-based Gregg this week drove up to Merseyside to take a hands-on involvement in the club after the resignation of the chief executive Trevor Birch. But Kenwright now looks in a much stronger position as he struggles to stabilise a club that has axed 15 players and signed only one, Marcus Bent from Ipswich for \u00a3450,000. Abercromby insists his decision has nothing to do with the current boardroom crisis and that it was made last season. But its announcement, with the club also desperate to persuade Wayne Rooney to stay at Goodison Park, casts a new shadow. \u00b7 El-Hadji Diouf and Liverpool are being sued by a Celtic supporter who alleges he was spat on by the Senegal international during a Uefa Cup match more than 16 months ago. Dominic Schiavone is seeking damages of \u00a350,000."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
