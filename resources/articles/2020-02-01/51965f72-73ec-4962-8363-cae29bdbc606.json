Large bins were placed on the carpet to catch the falling rainwater after it seeped through covers and on to the runway where the biggest names in film make their customary walk to the Dolby theatre in West Hollywood. Videos posted on social media showed teams of workers trying to sweep puddles of water away from the floor and off the roof of the temporary structure which protects the red carpet. Film crews were also caught in the downpour as the stars arrived. Rain was forecast ahead of the event, with the LA Times warning the event would most likely be \u201covercast and drippy\u201d and blaming the inclement weather on a stubborn \u201cmarine layer\u201d. February is often the wettest month of the year in California, however the rest of the state is seeing below average rainfall, and January was one of the driest on record for Los Angeles. At the Baftas last week, Al Pacino fell on the red carpet after tripping on some stairs, but was unhurt. The 71-year-old actor was nominated in the best supporting actor category for his performance in The Irishman and is therefore attending the Oscars."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
