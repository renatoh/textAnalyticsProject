Speaking at her chancellery on Tuesday morning, Merkel was quick to sketch out a worst-case scenario \u2013 unusually for a politician who prefers to deal in pragmatic solutions. \u201cGiven our current information, we have to assume we are dealing with a terrorist attack,\u201d she told reporters. But she added: \u201cWe do not want to live paralysed by the fear of evil. Even if it is difficult in these hours, we will find the strength for the life we want to live in Germany \u2013 free, together and open.\u201d Political opponents rejected her plea for unity, renewing their criticism of her refugee strategy and laying the blame for the attack unambiguously at her door. \u201cThe environment in which such acts can spread was carelessly and systematically imported over the past one and a half years,\u201d said Frauke Petry, leader of the rightwing populist Alternative for Germany (AfD). \u201cIt was not an isolated incident and it won\u2019t be the last.\u201d Petry\u2019s partner, MEP Marcus Pretzell, posted a message on Twitter for what he called the \u201cLet\u2019s-wait-and-see brigade\u201d less than an hour after the attack: \u201cThis is what happens when you wait and see\u201d. Horst Seehofer, the leader of Merkel\u2019s Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, criticised her policies in more diplomatic but no less forceful terms: \u201cWe owe it to the victims, to those affected and to the whole population to rethink our immigration and security policy and to change it.\u201d When she appeared before the television cameras on Tuesday morning, Merkel did not shy away from the possible ramifications of the attacker being identified as a refugee or migrant. \u201cI know that it would be particularly hard to bear for all of us if it was confirmed that a person committed this crime who asked for protection and asylum in Germany,\u201d she said. That confirmation appeared to follow soon after the end of her press conference, only to be withdrawn just a couple of hours later. As Merkel, together with the foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, and Berlin\u2019s mayor, Michael M\u00fcller, were laying down flowers at the site where the truck had crashed into the side of a Christmas market, the chief of Berlin\u2019s police admitted it was unclear whether the suspect they had arrested shortly after the attack was indeed the driver behind the deadly rampage. Later, the man \u2013 a 23-year-old Pakistani citizen who had arrived in Germany on 31 December 2015 \u2013 was released. The political significance of Monday night\u2019s tragedy, however, had by then been made clear. At the end of a year in which Merkel has seen some of her closest allies on the international stage succumb to populist anger \u2013 including US President Barack Obama, David Cameron in Britain, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande in France and Matteo Renzi in Italy \u2013 and just before the start of a year in which she is determined to avoid a similar fate, a deadly attack on German soil was precisely what her supporters feared most. Whatever the ongoing investigations into the perpetrator\u2019s motives reveal, the German chancellor will be faced with part of her electorate asking if the tragedy came about as a direct result of her policy decisions last year, when Merkel kept open Germany\u2019s borders for refugees stranded in Hungary. Reactions to the Berlin attack have already shown the extent to which an answer to that question is ideological. Hajo Funke, a politics professor at Berlin\u2019s Free University, suggested that Merkel would get little political mileage out of atoning for past decisions. \u201cGermany\u2019s voters will choose politicians based on whether they have workable political answers, not empty promises,\u201d he said. \u201cThe AfD has no actual solutions to the terrorist problem and 90% of the population sees that.\u201d Merkel\u2019s approval ratings dropped considerably after two terrorist attacks in southern Germany in the summer, but recently recovered to the levels the chancellor enjoyed before the start of the refugee crisis. While recent polls have put Petry\u2019s party on 12-13%, Funke argued that the \u201cbase of political power\u201d in Germany\u2019s coalition-based political system would continue to lie with Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats, currently on 33-36%, the centre-left Social Democrats (21-23%) and the Green party (10-11%). Yet in the wake of Monday\u2019s attack, even shoring up that base of support will require Merkel to do more to assure her electorate that she can guarantee their safety. At the Christian Democrats\u2019 conference earlier this month, it was clear that a party that once stood faithfully behind its leader now contained a backbench cabal agitating for a rightward lurch. Merkel has repeatedly shown that she is less averse to populist gestures on a domestic stage than her international admirers give her credit for: since September 2015, her government has gradually restricted the list of countries whose citizens can rightfully claim asylum in Germany, a point underlined by a series of high-profile deportations to Afghanistan that commenced last week. Last month, the German chancellor even endorsed her party\u2019s proposal for a ban of the full facial veil. She placed a caveat on her demand in characteristic style with the phrase \u201cwherever it is legally possible\u201d \u2013 a move echoed on Tuesday when she vowed that the perpetrator of the Berlin truck attack would be punished \u201cas severely as our laws demand\u201d. Even in the centre of the political spectrum, the room for manoeuvre is not limitless, however. After Monday\u2019s attack, and following a high-profile hunt for a man filmed kicking a young woman down a flight of stairs at a Berlin metro station, there may be an opportunity for Merkel to take a more hawkish stance on the use of CCTV surveillance in public space, traditionally a sensitive issue in privacy-conscious Germany. But after almost two years of a highly polemicised political debate over the refugee crisis, some policy avenues are now permanently closed to the chancellor. A set upper limit on the number of refugees who can enter the country \u2013 which many in her party believe would have reassured traditional conservatives \u2013 is out of the question because it would amount to a climbdown in her ongoing standoff with Seehofer and thus a serious loss of face. Merkel has gone way beyond the point where she can ever win back members of the AfD and their dyed-in-the-wool supporters. Arguably she does not need to, but a loss of political authority, and a party that tacks right while she steers left, could fatally undermine her campaign for a fourth term in next year\u2019s elections."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
