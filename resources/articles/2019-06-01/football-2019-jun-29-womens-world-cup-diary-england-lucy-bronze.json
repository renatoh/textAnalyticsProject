Walked them to the train station for the big goodbye, poetic. Nowhere has embraced the tournament quite like tiny Valenciennes, home to England v Cameroon. The match kicks off at 9pm in more ways than one \u2013 brutal, bizarre and sort of unmissable. Monday: Valenciennes to Rennes Writing on the train is rough. I get through it by periodically resting my eyes and head on my keyboard. The passenger opposite clearly thinks I am insane. Because of all the Netherlands fans, I\u2019m staying in an extremely nice hotel. I answer a strange knock on the door at 7pm to be greeted by a small plate of meringues, then spend much of the rest of the day debating whether the entire British press is racist for criticising the Cameroon team. Tuesday: Rennes I crash, spending the day catching up on Love Island (I know, I know, but with the England team all watching it I\u2019m going to chalk it off as research) and napping. Everyone needs a wallow now and again and today is my wallow day. I pick up a fresh hire car because the media shuttle bus in Rennes is erratic at best and my last match at Roazhon Park results in a 40min walk home at 1am. The Netherlands beat Japan and it\u2019s a little heartbreaking. I give lifts to various other journalists and get back to my room at 2am. Wednesday: Rennes to Le Havre I sleep in for as long as possible before meeting a friend for the drive to Le Havre, three hours away. We stop for some food. I am getting sick of bread and pastries. I thought about driving via Paris to catch Pierluigi Collina\u2019s press conference on refereeing but decide that would be insane and watch it on Fifa TV. I slip off to sleep, wake up and he\u2019s still going. My hotel doesn\u2019t have air-con and the heatwave has hit. Thursday: Le Havre England\u2019s first big knockout test, against Norway. Lose and the run will be seen as a disappointment; progress and the momentum will still be there. It\u2019s baking and I go in search of a laundrette. I tweet a picture of the dryer. A chain of journalists all tweet photos from the laveries of Le Havre. For the first time at a match there\u2019s butterflies but Jill Scott calms them quickly. I\u2019m writing the piece to complement the match report and have to send it after 80 minutes. Early on I choose to focus on Lucy Bronze. I made the right choice. It doesn\u2019t always work out like that. Friday: Le Havre to Paris England are now having a press session with players at 11am in Deauville, an hour\u2019s drive away. Cue a flurry of calls and cancelled trains by journalists who had booked travel to Lyon. I drive a batch over, interview players, write, then set off to Paris. A group of us check in, then order takeaway fried chicken while we furiously write up England follow-up material before \u201cthe big one\u201d, France against the USA. TV just cannot convey the noise and emotion in the stadium adequately. There\u2019s nothing like it. Saturday: Paris to Lyon Up early for breakfast (I now hate pastries and bread with a passion and am craving Bran Flakes with proper milk) and to drop off the car. Thus far I have driven down a pavement, gone the wrong way up a one-way street and been stuck between two car park barriers, twice. Other than that I\u2019ve adapted to the French roads. But I\u2019m glad I\u2019m getting the train to Lyon ..."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
