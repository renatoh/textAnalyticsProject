Cokanasiga has scored five tries in his six England starts to date, bursting on to the scene last autumn and demonstrating why Eddie Jones fast-tracked him into the World Cup squad with a fine display against Ireland last month. The 21-year-old\u2019s second cap came against the Wallabies last November and he has made three appearances against Wales in his short career so far but the 6ft 4in, 19st Cokanasiga has admitted he is plagued by self-doubt against the two teams England are most likely to face in the last eight at the World Cup, should they emerge from their pool. \u201cI get quite nervous playing against the big teams like Australia and Wales, and sometimes I question myself whether I can do it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then once I\u2019m in the game I\u2019m back to my normal sense and just try to do what I do. Obviously I hate being nervous but it shows that you do care. But once that whistle goes, something just goes and you think: \u2018I\u2019m here for a reason\u2019 so just try to show it. It\u2019s gone pretty quickly for me. I haven\u2019t really had time to think about it and process everything, but looking back it\u2019s been a dream come true. Hopefully I can keep building on that.\u201d As England continue their preparations in Miyazaki \u2013 Eddie Jones took his squad paddleboarding on Friday \u2013 South Africa\u2019s World Cup buildup was rocked when it emerged Eben Etzebeth is being investigated by prosecutors over his involvement in an alleged assault and racial abuse during a bar brawl last month. Furthermore the former Springboks head coach Pieter de Villiers has said he will not be supporting South Africa at the World Cup because of the team\u2019s handling of allegations. Etzebeth denies any wrongdoing. \u201cBy simply accepting Etzebeth\u2019s word and not launching an investigation, SA Rugby missed an opportunity to show that they are serious about stamping out racism,\u201d De Villiers told Planet Rugby. \u201cI therefore cannot support the Springboks at this year\u2019s World Cup.\u201d New Zealand have also been dealt a blow with the news the flanker Luke Jacobson has been ruled out of the World Cup because of a delayed onset of concussion and will be replaced by Shannon Frizell. The 22-year-old Jacobson had played only 20 minutes off the bench against Argentina before he was named in the squad for the tournament. He came off the bench against Tonga on 7 September and did not suffer any problems until the All Blacks arrived in Japan and he developed symptoms after their first training session. \u201cAfter discussing this latest episode with Luke, as well as our medical team, the decision has been made to, sadly, withdraw him from the tournament,\u201d the All Blacks coach, Steve Hansen, said. \u201cWe all felt the best thing for him to do is to take a break from rugby until he is symptom-free. While it was a tough conversation to have, ultimately it was a very simple decision. Luke\u2019s health is the most important thing.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
