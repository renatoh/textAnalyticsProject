It boasts two stable blocks to house eight horses, a large outdoor riding school, a Monarch horse-walking machine, a cross-country schooling course in park land and 15 acres of pasture for grazing. The accommodation for humans is pretty good too. The origins of the manor can be traced back to 1307, and its Tudor outline is virtually unchanged, although considerable alterations are believed to have been made to the exterior soon after the Restoration. The house has 10 bedrooms, two wine cellars, a games room, large drawing and sitting rooms as well as a family room, a stunning half-panelled dining room, large kitchen with huge Aga and separate pantry and utility rooms. The manor is surrounded by its own land: as well as the pasture there are 82 acres of arable land and 10 acres of woodland. There is an outdoor swimming pool, a hard tennis court, a two-bedroom stable cottage, a chauffeur's studio flat and a barn converted into space for entertaining. In fact, everything you could want for a 'to the manor born' lifestyle, if you have \u00a34.5 million.
