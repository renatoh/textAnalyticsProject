It seems as if Gesualdo's existing settings were collected together and published in two volumes simply for convenience, so that, unlike Monteverdi's madrigal books, there is no sense of musical development or a chronology to be established between them. As Marco Longhini, the conductor of Delitiae Musicae, points out in his very fine sleevenotes, the revolutionary works that would establish Gesualdo as one of the greatest vocal composers of the late Renaissance were still to be written; for the most part the 20 settings in book two \u2013 mostly to anonymous texts, though seven of them are by Torquato Tasso \u2013 mostly inhabit the musical world of Gesualdo's older contemporaries such as De Rore and De Wert. But even if they broke no new ground, these are still pieces of great beauty and lyrical force, as the performances by the six male voices of Delitiae Musicae show. As an appendix, they include Gesualdo's two surviving instrumental pieces, played on a clavichord and four violas da gamba respectively."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
