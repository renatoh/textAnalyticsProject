The team were bottom of the Concacaf qualifying group with a point from three matches, a 5-1 defeat in Guatemala among them, when Beenhakker took over 14 months ago and Hislop is happy to outline what the cigar-smoking 63-year-old has brought to the job. \"Professionalism and a real organisation to the team, which I think we've sorely lacked,\" said the 37-year-old goalkeeper who rejoined West Ham as third choice last summer after being released by Portsmouth. \"We've always managed to produce good players. You look at our squad and from a country of 1.5 million we have something like 13 or 14 playing in England and Scotland. We have talent but we've lacked that organisation and real sense of professionalism which thankfully he's brought.\" T&amp;T's recovery under Beenhakker was capped by a 2-1 win over Mexico and then the play-off defeat of Bahrain that earned a place in Germany. Reflecting on the qualifiers before the man who coached Holland at Italia '90 took over, Hislop said: \"It didn't look like we had a chance.\" Now he goes to the finals confident of being part of something special. \"This team is capable of a surprise or two,\" he said. \"Who it will be, only time will tell. I'm sure it will happen to somebody.\" T&amp;T start against Sweden on Saturday before facing England, and Hislop believes Beenhakker will ensure the squad is perfectly prepared for every challenge. \"We had a long chat about what we can expect from the three teams in our group and what we can do to counter that,\" he said. \"I'm fairly certain we'll get to know the Swedish players a lot more intimately, if that's the right word - the way Beenhakker prepares it will be almost intimate. Leo is famed for leaving no stone unturned. . .I think more people are prepared to take Trinidad for granted, and that suits us. That's what we're hoping for.\" Hislop, who faces a fight for the No1 spot with Dundee's Kelvin Jack, brushed aside recent defeats to Wales, Slovenia and the Czech Republic and insists the mood remains positive. \"Team spirit is high,\" he said. \"Everyone is quite excited by what the next few weeks have to offer. We are looking forward to it but the guys are getting quite anxious now. We feel a little bit [stressed]. We have been working on a lot of things, trying to fine-tune and get things ready to be prepared for the game against Sweden.\" After twice narrowly missing out on the World Cup, T&amp;T excitement is amplified. \"We needed a draw to qualify [for 1990] and we lost to the US in Trinidad,\" Hislop said. \"For 1974 we needed to beat Haiti in Haiti, had five goals disallowed and lost by a goal. We knew what it meant to everyone when we qualified.\" Among their fans is Brian Lara. \"He goes to all the games,\" Hislop said. \"I played Under-14 national team with Brian - myself, Dwight [Yorke], Brian, Russell Latapy played. He was a striker but he was too small. I played cricket with him. I take credit - he mastered a lot of his strokes off my bowling.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
