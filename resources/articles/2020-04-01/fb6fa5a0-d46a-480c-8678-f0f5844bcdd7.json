Some health experts have suggested that the US would have to carry out 5m tests a day by June to reopen its economy safely. Others have suggested as many as 20m tests a day would ultimately be needed. The US daily rate is currently 200,000. Addressing a news conference on aid to small businesses on Tuesday, Trump appeared unaware of the current figures, suggesting \u201cit could be that we\u2019re getting very close\u201d to 5m daily tests. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be there very soon,\u201d he said. The US has carried out 5.6m tests over the past two months, which as Trump pointed out was far more than any other country, but represented about 1.6% of the population, a higher percentage than most countries, though significantly below Italy. Trump was also bullish on the prospects for economic recovery in the fall. \u201cNow our country\u2019s opening up again and I think it\u2019s going to be very, very successful,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the fourth quarter will be great. And I think next year is going to be a tremendous year for this country.\u201d In what looks almost certain to become another hostage to fortune, the president implied that the pandemic would be largely cleared by the fourth quarter of the year. \u201cI think what happens is it\u2019s going to go away. This is going to go,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd whether it comes back in a modified form in the fall, we\u2019ll be able to handle it. We\u2019ll be able to put out spurts, and we\u2019re very prepared to handle it.\u201d On a day that cases hit the grim 1m milestone and fatalities overtook the US death toll from the Vietnam war of 58,220, Trump was reminded that in February, he had predicted that infections would soon all but evaporate. The president said on 26 February, when there were only 15 confirmed US cases, that \u201cwithin a couple of days [it\u2019s] going to be down to close to zero, That\u2019s a pretty good job we\u2019ve done.\u201d He replied on Tuesday that it would \u201cultimately\u201d be true. \u201cAt the appropriate time it will be down to zero, like we said,\u201d he insisted. The US began wholesale testing weeks later than many other developed countries, a fact Trump hinted was the fault of the previous administration. \u201cWe inherited a very broken test,\u201d he said, although the faulty test was produced in early February, three years into Trump\u2019s administration. The president also pointed to unnamed experts for the initial complacency of the administration\u2019s response. \u201cMany very good experts, very good people too, said that this would never affect the United States, it wouldn\u2019t affect Europe, it wouldn\u2019t affect anything outside of China,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so we were listening to experts and we always will listen to experts, but the experts got it wrong.\u201d Global health experts were almost unanimous in raising the alarm over the coronavirus threat in January and February. The Washington Post reported on Tuesday that US intelligence agencies had also issued warnings about the scale of the coronavirus threats in more than a dozen of the president\u2019s daily classified briefings over the course of January and February. The danger was played down, however, by several television personalities who the president watches regularly, and reportedly by his health and human services secretary, Alex Azar, who according to the Wall Street Journal assured Trump on 29 January that the coronavirus was under control in the US."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
