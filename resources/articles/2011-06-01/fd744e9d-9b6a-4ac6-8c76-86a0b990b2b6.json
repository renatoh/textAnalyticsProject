Already boasting showings from a succession of on-the-money experimental club nights, tonight sees Richard D Clouston's cult kosmische and coldwave Cosey Club making its debut at the venue \u2013 and The Guide's week will be bookended by another visionary dance party. Though Savage Beach's own blurb sounds bleak, they tell punters they can \"expect the sounds and sights of civilisation falling apart as viewed from the beach\", things aren't quite as apocalyptic as all that. Keeping the horsemen at bay with early electronica and extended mixes, there'll be a skewed sort of sunshine in the kind of music you'll hear throughout the night, which will sail from psychedelic yacht rock and austere disco to haunted house. Baby Bathhouse, N16, Fri Leonie Cooper Shangaan Electro, Salford The promise of a barbecue isn't the only indicator that this party at Islington Mill may be more of a presentation than a traditional club session. The showcased music \u2013 South African Shangaan electro \u2013 bounces along at a breakneck 180bpm, making participation unimaginable for some. Luckily, clown-masked dancers the Tshetsha Boys and leading producer Nozinja will be stoking the party. But will the crowd dance? Hard to say. Thing is, though, the only thing more embarrassing than being one of the inept but gung-ho sorts who give such alien dances a go, is being one of the joyless, smug sorts who just stands around tutting. Islington Mill, James Street, Sun Marc Rowlands Day Light To Dark Knight, Exeter South-west house and techno specialists Dark Knight have produced a nifty sounding, two-in-one package for today's rare sojourn into the daylight hours. Their generation-spanning one-off, Day Light To Dark Knight, opens up at 3pm for a free session aimed at under-18s before running from 9pm-2am as a regular club night with a very reasonable cover charge of just \u00a32. Formed two years ago by a group of Phoenix Art Centre bar staff, Dark Knight will be drawing on friends spanning pretty much every style including Godskitchen and Pam's House regular Kelly Jay, dirty house specialist Clark Smith from Sleazy Does It, hirsute Welsh house head DJ Ross and Ben Andrews, who likes to dabble in progressive and breaks. Dark Knight's own Dizzit and Blackout will also be taking time out from those all-important promoting duties to caress their beloved wheels of steel. Phoenix Arts Centre, Bradninch Place, Gandy Street, Sat John Mitchell Numbers Is 8, Glasgow Since we're talking Numbers here, one in particular looms large in this month's outing of the long-running celebration of hip-hop-infused electro, as it celebrates its eighth birthday on Friday. Like any normal eight-year-old, Numbers has grown and developed at an astonishing rate, although hopefully unlike a child, Numbers actually spent its formative years learning life skills in sweaty basements around Glasgow. The past 12 months have seen them spreading their party aesthetic around the world with a stint at Berlin's Berghain, a US tour and a showcase at Barcelona's S\u00f3nar Festival. Their label has seen releases from the likes of Deadboy and Redinho, and resident DJ Jackmaster chose the tunes for the Fabric Live 57 mix CD. His fellow resident Spencer gets the party started, while guest DJ Floating Points pops a few dancefloor corkers. Sub Club, Jamaica St, Fri Patric Baird Chew The Fat!, London After over 13 years in the game, Paul Arnold's Chew The Fat! is still very much a major-league contender, with its fun-focused nights as much about having a laugh on the dancefloor as they are about hearing the best new and underground sounds; which you will, trust us. Tonight's lineup is as meaty as the beats that'll be offered up, with producer and DJ Brodinski the main name on a bill that has swept the length and breadth of the continent to bring the Fat faithful a sizzling summer's evening out. Foamo, Evil Nine and Canblaster will all be adding their own twists to the night's electro and house soundtrack, while Estonian talent Mord Fustang makes his London club debut. Things take a turn for the funky in room 2, with Rinse FM's Marco Del Horno in charge, letting the Bullet Train's big bass do some welcome damage.
