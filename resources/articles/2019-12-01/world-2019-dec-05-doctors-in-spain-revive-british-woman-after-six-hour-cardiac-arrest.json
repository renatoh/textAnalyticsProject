Audrey Mash said she was surprised at the attention her case had attracted and said it had not put her off hiking. \u201cI feel like a fraud for not being back at work. I\u2019m hoping to go back before the end of next week,\u201d she said on Thursday. She and her husband, Rohan Schoeman \u2013 who live in Barcelona \u2013 set out from Coma de Vaca to N\u00faria on the morning of 3 November. Around lunchtime, after the temperature dropped and it began to snow, Schoeman noticed that his wife was speaking oddly and becoming incoherent. Shortly afterwards, she stopped moving and fell unconscious. He rang friends, who helped firefighters and rescuers locate them and launch a helicopter rescue operation. But bad weather delayed the rescue and by the time they reached the pair, it was 3.30pm. \u201cOur first assessment suggested that Audrey was in a bad way,\u201d said one of the rescuers, Pere Serral. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t find any vital signs and we did what we could using pre-hospital techniques.\u201d By that point, Mash had severe hypothermia and her body temperature had fallen to just 18C; normal body temperature is 37C. She was then taken by helicopter to the Vall d\u2019Hebron hospital in Barcelona, which has an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machine (Ecmo). When connected to a patient, the Ecmo takes over the functioning of the heart and lungs, oxygenating the blood outside the body then reintroducing it, allowing both organs to rest. The Ecmo had never been used in Spain for a resuscitation procedure. But by 9.45pm, Mash\u2019s body temperature had risen to 30C and the doctors tried again to revive her, using a defibrillator. Dr Eduardo Argudo said doctors at the hospital had decided to use the machine \u201cto win some time so that her brain could receive oxygen while we treated the cause of the cardiac arrest\u201d. He added: \u201cAlthough hypothermia was about to kill Audrey, it also saved her because her body \u2013 and above all her brain \u2013 didn\u2019t get any worse. If she\u2019d been in cardiac arrest for that long with a normal body temperature, we\u2019d have been certifying her death. But we knew that the severe hypothermia meant that we had a shot at saving her thanks to the Ecmo.\u201d Argudo said that while hers was the longest instance of cardiac arrest survival documented in Spain, similar cases had occurred in the Alps and in Scandinavia. Mash, who is 34, spent six days in the intensive care unit, where doctors monitored her for signs of neurological damage. \u201cI\u2019m good but a little surprised by all the attention it\u2019s got today \u2013 it must be a slow news week,\u201d she told the Guardian on Thursday evening. \u201cI recovered much faster than I, or I think the doctors, expected. I was out of intensive care after six days and out of hospital six days after that. The doctors have since told me that they expected me to be in intensive care for closer to a month.\u201d Mash, an English teacher who has lived in Barcelona for more than two years, said she was getting back to normal and that the ordeal had not put her off hiking. \u201cI think my husband is a little more dubious about it than me \u2013 he has to live with the memories,\u201d she said. \u201cI woke up when it was all over. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be out in any high mountain this winter. But I do hope that next spring or summer we\u2019ll be able to go back and do some long walking and feel confident in it. I don\u2019t want it to take away from my enjoyment of the mountains.\u201d Agence France-Presse contributed to this report"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
