The surprise move comes after new evidence from Liberal Democrat MP Paul Burstow that as many as one in five children using online chatrooms has been approached by paedophiles. The prime minister made the pledge in the Commons during question time - and just hours after the home secretary, Jack Straw, had a meeting to discuss the issue earlier today. A spokesman for the home office confirmed: \"It is one of a range of issues we are actively considering. \"Whether or not the current criminal laws are strong enough to prosecute for online soliciting is something we need to consider, as well as whether this could take the form of an amendment to an existing act or an entirely new bill.\" Mr Blair was prompted to address the problems of youngsters being preyed on in Internet chatrooms after Mr Burstow \u0096 who is MP for Sutton and Cheam - called for the law to be changed to make \"online grooming\" a criminal offence. Mr Burstow said last year a 12-year-old in his constituency had been approached through a teenage Internet chatroom by a paedophile. \"He groomed her online to entice her to an offline meeting for sexual purposes,\" said Mr Burstow. \"As many as one in five children who use internet chatrooms are approached by paedophiles in this way.\" Such a law has the backing of internet crusader and TV personality Carol Vorderman and the internet watch foundation. However, a Whitehall insider said: \"Pragmatically, there is not enough time this side of an election for this to happen \u0096 even if it got the go-ahead.\" Useful links 25.10.00 Five years for man who lured girl via internet The issue explained Net regulation Relevant links Cyber rights and civil liberites Net parent Cyber angel Debate Policiing the net"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
