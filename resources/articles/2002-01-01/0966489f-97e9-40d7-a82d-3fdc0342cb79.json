Built on a rock-and-sand spit just outside the Straits of Gibraltar, Cadiz had served as the first port of call in the Old World for many of the treasure fleets arriving from Spain's vast American colonies. It was this that interested Robert. Wiping his sweaty cheeks and forehead with a handkerchief, he composed his face into what he thought was a dignified but friendly expression. He then pressed the buzzer mounted on the stone jamb. \"Que?\" a voice said through the speaker. He gave his name. There was no response, only the harsh buzz of the electronic lock pulling back. He pushed open the heavy door. He'd been in old Cadiz merchant houses before, but he'd never seen one so beautifully preserved. He followed the tunnel of a barrel-vaulted stone foyer until it suddenly jumped open in an atrium that reached up a full five storeys to the sky. A tall palm stood in its centre, and its marble floor - black-and-white squares, like a chessboard - had been hollowed in places by centuries of boot traffic striding across it to the in-house merchant offices. \"Aqui!\" a voice called, echoing through the atrium. \" Venga! \" Robert looked up. A young woman stood on the third-floor balcony, its filigreed, wrought-iron railing encircling the atrium. He started up the marble stairs. On the landings he passed antique Mudejar chests inlaid with ivory arabesques created by Moorish craftsmen. There were chairs upholstered in embroidered leather dating from the 16th century. Everywhere Robert looked, he saw expensive relics from Spain's distant and glorious past. This has got to be the place , he thought. At the top of the stairs, the young woman led him along the balcony into a sitting room. There, in a straight-backed armchair, sat an elegant old woman. A white Andalusian shawl, laced like the web of a spider, was draped over the shoulders of her black dress. Her white hair was pulled back so tightly that it stretched the skin against her skull. She lifted a hand to gesture to another straight-backed chair.\"You're not the first, you know,\" the old woman began abruptly. \"Someone has been here before me?\" \"Not since my time,\" she replied, her lips moving carefully. \"I only know what my grandmother told me when I was a girl. She heard it from her mother. Someone went to look for the ship. They say that no one will ever reach it because the ship lies muy hondo . Very deep.\" \"But that was many, many years ago,\" Robert said. \"Now maybe it is easier to find with modern diving equipment. It's possible to go very deep.\" \" Quiza ,\" was all the woman said in reply. Perhaps. As they sat, the young woman carried in a tray bearing a silver coffeepot. The two of them watched as she poured out with slender white hands a thick, black stream of coffee into two cups. \"This is my granddaughter,\" said the old woman. For the first time, Robert, so transfixed by the house's furnishings, closely noticed the young woman's face. In a quiet way, she was beautiful. She had jet-black hair piled on her head that accentuated her white skin. Her eyes were dark and deep and wide when she looked up at Robert to ask him if he'd like anything in his coffee, and her lips were carefully painted a blush of red. \"Why do you think I can help you?\" the old woman asked. \"Please, senora ,\" Robert began. \"I've been to the archives in Seville. For months I've been reading the old manuscripts and the merchant bills of lading. I know about the storm in 1605 and the loss of the ships of that year's fleet. As I explained in my letter to you, I know how much your ancestor lost. I know the ships and his lost wealth have never been recovered.\" \"Why do you want to search for oro y plata ?\" she said. \"Gold and silver have given blood and trouble enough to the world.\" \"I collect things, \" Robert replied, suddenly aware that this was not much of an explanation. Seductive and treacherous \"women of the sea\" occur in the myths of maritime cultures around the world. In the ancient Mediterranean, the Sirens, beautiful but deadly nymphs, used their sweet, hypnotic songs to lure sailors toward the rocks. Deep beneath the waves, the sea does not show its tempestuous side. It offers instead an aquamarine beauty and silent mystery that are just as seductive as the sparkling blue surface, and perhaps even more deadly. Divers have many terms, medical and otherwise, to describe the physiological consequences of this undersea seductiveness. Perhaps the most apt was coined by the pioneering - and poetic - French divers describing what happens to those breathing compressed air who descend too far into the serene depths: \"Rapture of the deep.\" The human body is surprisingly adaptable to the depths, at least on the way down. All humans, in different ways, thrive on pressure. Not just pressure from work or money or romance, but actual pounds-per-square-inch pressure. As a species, humans have adapted to live contentedly with 14.7 pounds per square inch, the air pressure at sea level. The 14.7 pounds - the equivalent of an average frozen turkey perched on every square inch of one's body - represents the weight of a very tall one-inch-by-one-inch column of air that extends from sea level many miles up to the farthest edge of the earth's atmosphere. This pressure pushes on us equally from outside as well as from inside - inside our lungs, our throats, and elsewhere - and is the key reason why we don't notice the groaning weight pressing around us. Water, however, weighs vastly more than air. A one-inch-by-one-inch column of seawater would need only to be 33ft tall to weigh the same amount as that miles-high column of air. This difference in weight has profound consequences for humans who dive under the sea. If a person were to swim down to a depth of 33ft, the pressure on his or her body would double from the standard 14.7 pounds at the surface to 29.4 pounds, or two frozen turkeys, per square inch (psi). This is known as two atmospheres of pressure. At 66ft in depth, the pressure would triple to three atmospheres, or 44.1 pounds per square inch; at 99ft, it would quadruple to four atmospheres, or 58.8 psi; and at 132ft, about the recommended limit for recreational divers using scuba gear, the pressure would be five atmospheres, or 73.5 psi. At this depth, the average-sized human male experiences a total of about 100 tonnes or 13,400 frozen turkeys pressing over his body surface. Divers for thousands of years have struggled with these tremendous pressures of the deep. Greek sponge divers of Aristotle's time knotted ropes around their waists, packed their ear canals with oil-soaked sponges to help equalise the pressure stabbing at their eardrums, took a curved knife in one hand and a heavy stone in the other, and plummeted to the bottom, relying on their compatriots above to pull them - sometimes dead - to the surface after they'd gathered the harvest. The ancient Arab pearl divers pierced their eardrums to relieve the pressure of the depths. The diving suit of the mid-19th century, while allowing divers to go deeper and stay down longer than those who simply held their breath, only aggravated pressure-related maladies. As the Industrial Age surged forward, other inventions allowed workers to breathe deep beneath the surface. French engineers devised a method to build bridge pilings by placing large metal cylinders on the river bottoms, pumping these caissons full of compressed air and placing workers inside. Strange new maladies, however, began to appear. During construction of the Brooklyn Bridge in the late 19th century, workers emerging from the caissons walked about bent stiffly forward at the hips due to the sudden onset of joint pain. Their fellow workers thought the gait resembled the fashionable \"Grecian bend\" of the tightly corseted New York society women. The name \"the bends\" stuck. During the second world war, French gas engineer Emile Gagnan and a soon-to-be-famous diver named Jacques-Yves Cousteau invented the self-contained underwater breathing apparatus, or scuba - a system that allowed divers to dispense with the cumbersome suit and hose, and carry their air supply in tanks on their backs. The genius of the Gagnan-Cousteau equipment was a small disc-like device on the mouthpiece called a demand regulator, which, using a diaphragm to sense the water pressure, fed compressed air from the tanks to the diver at the exact same pressure as the water pushing on his lungs from outside. With the pressure equalised inside and outside the chest walls, breathing far beneath the surface was effortless. But divers using the gear, it turned out, were subject to the same \"bends\" that caisson workers suffered. And there were still other maladies that divers came to know as \"the chokes\", \"the itches\", \"the staggers\", \"the narcs\", \"the niggles\" and \"the creeps\", having to do, variously, with uncontrollable coughing upon surfacing, itching of the skin, dizziness and nausea, and odd but fleeting aches. Researchers continued to try to understand what great pressure does to divers breathing compressed air. They discovered that the pressures of the depths drive nitrogen contained in the compressed air into the diver's blood and tissues. A breath of air is, after all, four-fifths nitrogen and only one-fifth oxygen. At depths over 100ft, the nitrogen absorbed by brain tissues can anaesthetise the diver like laughing gas. If the diver ascends slowly from these depths, the nitrogen seeps out of the blood and tissues on the way to the surface and is harmlessly expelled by the lungs. A too-rapid ascent, however, causes the pressurised nitrogen to fizz inside the tissues and blood much like the gas bubbles in a just-opened soda bottle. These bubbles cause the bends. At the end of the 19th century, the eminent British physiologist JS Haldane, who worked with bends-afflicted divers and depressurised goats, concluded that the human body generally can tolerate a two-to-one reduction in pressure without suffering the symptoms of decompression illness. This would allow a diver to ascend from two atmospheres to one (ie, 33ft to the surface) or from four atmospheres to two atmospheres (99ft to 33ft) without fear of the bends. Based on this work, Haldane developed a set of schedules - much refined by later generations of divers - that they could use to plan their dives. If the diver does suffer from a case of the bends, he or she must be recompressed - recapping the soda bottle, so to speak - by returning below the surface and resuming the ascent in stages, to let the nitrogen reabsorb in the tissues and then slowly seep out. This is difficult to accomplish underwater. A better alternative is to place the diver in a recompression chamber and pump it full of compressed air to mimic the high water pressures undersea, then slowly decrease the pressure. The bends, however, is not the most fatal of the maladies grouped under the term dysbarism. Drowning still remains the leading cause of death among divers. The second most common death is a form of dysbarism that occurs when, due to panic or haste, the diver doesn't breathe out regularly as he or she swims to the surface. The compressed air in the lungs expands with the lessening of the water pressure like an inflating balloon. If the diver keeps holding his or her breath, the lung tissues will rupture. The air in the lungs then enters directly into the bloodstream, and coarse bubbles foam through the heart and into the brain. The result is cataclysmic. \"Nothing down there for you to see, mon. All the pretty fish are over there.\" The small wooden boat rocked on the blue swells just off the Caribbean reef, its outboard motor idling. Robert was pointing out to the fisherman, Felix, the exact spot he wanted to dive, a deep channel that cut through the reef's paler greenish waters like a deep, thick vein of the sea's dark-blue blood. He again consulted his chart and then the digital read-out on his handheld GPS - the global positioning device that reads satellite signals to give his exact position on the face of the globe. \"Right there.\" \"Okay. I'll take you there if you want to go, but I tell you for certain you see only naked sand down there in the deep water.\" Felix reached back, flipped the outboard's gear lever into forward, and twisted the throttle. The heavy wooden boat heaved over the swells toward the broad stripe of the channel. Just short of it, still over the reef's submerged shelf in about 40ft of water, Felix cut the engine and flung the anchor overboard. In silence but for the sloshing of the swells up the sides of the boat's hull and the clanking of his air tanks, Robert began to prepare his equipment. He knew how to dive from his days as a collector, combing lake bottoms for old bottles. Robert strapped his air tanks to his BC, or buoyancy control - a vestlike device into which the diver could inject or release air to maintain neutral buoyancy while underwater. Each of the two tanks contained 80 cubic feet of air squeezed to a fraction of that volume. He inserted the mouthpiece, and inhaled - once, twice, three times. The air flowed easily into his lungs. He examined his spare regulator, or \"octopus\", attached to its own hose should his main regulator fail. He consulted the all-important dive-planning tables. At a depth of 90ft - as deep as the bottom of the channel, according to the charts - he could spend a maximum of 21 minutes. Any deeper or any longer, and he would have to make stops on the ascent. Though Robert now dived less than he once did, he intimately knew the safety checks. He meticulously followed all of them except one: never dive alone . \"Okay, are you ready?\" Felix asked. Robert nodded. \"Okay, one, two, three, over you go.\" With a little nudge from Felix, Robert tumbled backward off the gunnel into the swells in a gentle splash. Five feet (1.2 atmospheres of pressure, or 17.6 psi): A swirl of bubbles swept across his mask, and warm, tropical water trickled into his ears and wetsuit. The vigorous rocking of the boat softened to the gentle up-and-down motion of the sea just beneath the swells, comforting and familiar, as if awakening some primordial memory of the womb. The harsh sound of wind and waves suddenly ceased, replaced by the underwater clicking and scraping of unseen fish along the reef. Robert righted himself from his tumble. He hovered for a few moments, belly down, to orient himself. In his left hand, he held a small instrument console. He took a compass bearing to the northwest, flipped his fins, and slanted down toward the bottom. Robert knew exactly the direction he wanted to go, thanks to the old woman and her granddaughter in Cadiz. From the bills of lading in the Seville archives, he knew what her ancestor's cargo had included: gold rods in various sizes and weights; an emerald-studded gold crucifix, gold rosaries and jewellery; plus hundreds of ingots of silver that had been laid like brick ballast in the bottom of the hull. \"The loss was a very difficult one for our business,\" the old woman had told him. \"But you can see\" - here, she gestured at the room, at herself - \"my family survived the loss.\" Robert leaned slightly forward in his chair toward her. He wanted to appear interested but not too eager. \"Did your ancestors know where the ship went down?\" he asked carefully. \"There are many letters describing the disaster,\" she replied. \"Descriptions of reefs near where the ship sunk.\" Robert leaned further forward in the Moorish chair. \"Do you know what happened to the letters?\" he asked. \"Do they still survive?\" \" Claro ,\" she said, with a click of her rosary beads. \"Where are they?\" \"I have them here,\" she said, picking up a small brass bell and shaking it, the tingling sound echoing out in the old house's marble atrium. \"They are under my bed. My granddaughter will show you.\" Robert then leaned forward in his chair so far that it swayed on the verge of collapse. As he descended, Robert paused every few feet to check his instruments and clear his ears. He did this by thrusting his jaw forward and by swallowing, opening the 1.5-inch long Eustachian tubes that served as air passages from his throat to the air-filled chamber of his middle ear. Middle-ear barotrauma is diving's most common medical problem, but even in its most serious form - a rupture of the eardrum - the damage usually heals in a week or two. Thirty-three feet (two atmospheres, or 29.4 psi): a few feet below him, Robert spotted Felix's anchor lying amid patches of coral and sand. A large grouper drifted off to his right. The pressure on his body had now doubled since leaving Felix's boat. A balloon full of air - 12 litres, for example - brought to this depth would have now been compressed to half its size, or six litres, according to Boyle's law of gases. Likewise, each breath of air Robert's regulator fed him from his tanks was twice as compressed as a breath of air at the surface, meaning, all things being equal, that his air supply would last only half as long at this depth. Leaving the anchor, Robert followed his compass bearing of 340 degrees northwest across the reef's shelf toward the deeper blue cut of the channel. The swimming was easy. After a few minutes, the coral suddenly plunged steeply downward in an underwater wall. Fifty-five feet (2.7 atmospheres, or 39.7 psi): he paused at the drop-off, just able to make out the bluish, sandy floor of the channel far below. Brightly coloured fish flitted past - spotted drums, damselfish, indigo hamlets. Robert ignored them; he was focused on a far bigger catch. He checked his pressure gauge: there were 2,750 pounds per square inch of air remaining in his tanks. He checked his watch: seven minutes had elapsed since he left the surface. He felt good. He felt a warm flush of excitement even under his wetsuit. As he angled down the reef's wall, his pulsing fins propelling him deeper, he was no longer a paunchy, lonely, middle-aged schoolteacher, but a sleek, black-clad undersea creature. He was a shark that used his intellect instead of his sense of smell and movement to locate his prey. Seventy-two feet (3.2 atmospheres, or 47 psi): Robert swam down past boulder coral, wire coral, black coral and yellow tube sponges reaching out like fingers to strain tiny creatures from the seawater. His body now was experiencing a pressure of nearly 50 pounds per square inch. He noticed subtle physiological changes: a pressing on his sinuses, and a slightly greater effort to breathe as the air he inhaled became more dense. Eighty feet (3.4 atmospheres, or 50 psi): Robert glanced again at his depth gauge, then down the reef wall to the bottom. He'd nearly reached the planned limit of his dive - 90ft - but the bottom, still lying well below him, was further than he'd thought. \"Plan your dive,\" was one of the diver's mantras, \"and dive your plan.\" He knew he should dive no deeper. But he was so close. He could feel the presence of the wrecked ship. He could sense the precious metals, the golden chains and sceptres. He couldn't bear the thought of leaving that collection, of wasting the dive, wasting the air in his tanks. Not when he was this close. No, this was his chance. He'd stick to his plan, but he'd modify it slightly: he'd descend to 90ft, maybe a bit further, and swim along at that depth and try to scan the bottom. Ninety-nine feet (4 atmospheres, or 59 psi): he could now see the bottom clearly, although he was still well above it. Flat and sandy, it was bathed in deep bluish hues and littered with broken pieces of coral. Hovering above it, he calculated his strategy: he'd remain at 99ft for only 15 minutes, instead of the 21 minutes that, according to the dive-planning tables, he was allowed at 90ft, and he'd make a brief \"safety stop\" on the way up. At this depth, his air supply would last only one-quarter the length of time.
