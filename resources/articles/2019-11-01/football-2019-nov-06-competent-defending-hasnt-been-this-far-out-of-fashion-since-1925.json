Eight goals were scored. Two were penalties. Another two were own goals. The penalties were expertly converted, while one of the own goals twanged off someone\u2019s big, startled, confused face in the grand music-hall manner. There was a double sending off for two separate incidents during the same passage of play, one of them a hilariously harsh handball decision. A three-goal comeback was completed in 11 minutes. A late winner got ruled out by VAR, while the side down to nine men were sending their full-backs upfield on the overlap during added time. Also, there was only one set of fans in attendance, so the whole thing was played out in a very surreal, lopsided atmosphere indeed. And they say the group stage is the boring bit. Thing is, they used to have a point. We\u2019re only just past the halfway mark in the groups, and already we can file Tuesday night\u2019s 4-4 alongside a 4-3, a 6-2 and that 2-7. Throw in a 6-0 and a 4-3 in Big Vase, plus last week\u2019s preposterous 5-5 draw in the Tin Pot at Anfield, and something very strange is happening in elite football right now. Competent defending hasn\u2019t been this far out of fashion since 1925, when the First Division was producing scorelines such as 11-2, 10-0, 1-7 (twice), 8-3 (twice), 7-3, 6-3 (five times) and 5-3 (four times). That particular carry-on was put down to confusion over the new offside law, although the contemporary half-time diet of cooking brandy, cheroots and industrial-strength speed must also have had some bearing, surely. But there are no such excuses today. We can\u2019t even blame this on VAR, even though we\u2019d like to. What\u2019s going on? Whatever it is, we\u2019re on board. And it would seem that Frank Lampard is as well, his post-match quotes suggesting he\u2019s buying into the reckless pleasures of freewheeling fun bigstyle. \u201cI had some mad nights over the years, but this is certainly right up there,\u201d he grinned, feeling all warm and fuzzy. \u201cWe need to tighten up for sure, but with that spirit we can go places.\u201d The suggestion implicit that the latter might be more important to him than the former. It\u2019s a brave philosophy which guarantees entertainment, though not necessarily trophies. But then again what\u2019s more important? We\u2019ll be talking about Tuesday evening for years to come, while all traces of Sarriball have already been erased from the memory banks.

FIVER LETTERS \u201cI\u2019m sure Mike Riley\u2019s meeting with Premier League managers re VAR will be productive with decisions made on how to move forward (Tuesday\u2019s Bits and Bobs). Chances are these decisions will then be reviewed and overturned a few minutes after everyone\u2019s left by someone at Stockley Park\u201d \u2013 Dave Hassall. \u201cJust to clarify it was the Old Bill who \u2018suggested\u2019 Orient move the game against Brighton U21s.
