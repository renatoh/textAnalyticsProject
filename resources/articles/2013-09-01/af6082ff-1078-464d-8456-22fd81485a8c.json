The city's mayor, Vincent Gray, confirmed the death toll at a press conference on Monday afternoon. Gray said there is \"no known motive at this stage\". He said officials \"do not have any reason at this stage to suspect terrorism\". \u2022 The gunman has been identified as Aaron Alexis, a 34-year-old military contractor. The FBI appealed for people to come forward with details on Alexis, who had recently been living in Fort Worth, Texas. \"No piece of information is too small. We are looking to learn everything we can about his movements and his associates,\" said assistant Valerie Parlave. \u2022 The FBI are still hunting a potential second suspect in the shooting, authorities said. Authorities said they were trying to locate a man seen at the navy yard this morning \"to determine what if any involvement he may have had\". The man is described as a black male wearing an olive military\u2013style uniform. He is between 40 and 50-years-old, approximately 5'10\" with grey sideburns, according to police. \u2022 Authorities are yet to identify any of those killed. A police officer was among those injured. He suffered injuries to \"bones and blood vessels in his legs\" and was in surgery on Monday afternoon, a spokeswoman from MedStar Washington Hospital Center said. The other two MedStar patients were female. One had been shot in her shoulder, the other in her head and hand. All were expected to survive. \u2022 Alexis was remembered as a \"sweet\" man by customers at a thai restaurant where he worked in Fort Worth. But police in Seattle and Texas said he had been arrested twice in recent years for gun violations. In Seattle in 2004 he shot out the tyres of a vehicle in an \"anger-fuelled blackout\" police said. He had also been arrested in Texas after shooting a gun through the ceiling of his apartment. \u2022 President Obama said the victims had faced \"unimaginable violence\" and offered his condolences to their families. \"We will honour their service to the nation we helped to make great,\" Obama said. \"Obviously we will investigate thoroughly what has happened, as we have so many of these shootings that has happened sadly.\" The president issued a proclamation which ordered for flags to be lowered to half-staff at all public buildings and military posts. Aaron Alexis was arrested in Seattle in 2004 for an \"anger-fuelled\" shooting, according to the Seattle police department. The Seattle police blog confirms that Alexis was arrested after shooting out the tyres of a man's vehicle. Following his arrest, Alexis told detectives he perceived he had been \u201cmocked\u201d by construction workers the morning of the incident and said they had \u201cdisrespected him.\u201d Alexis also claimed he had an anger-fueled \u201cblackout,\u201d and could not remember firing his gun at the victims\u2019 vehicle until an hour after the incident. Alexis also told police he was present during \u201cthe tragic events of September 11, 2001\u2033 and described \u201chow those events had disturbed him.\u201d Detectives later spoke with Alexis\u2019 father, who lived in New York at the time, who told police Alexis had anger management problems associated with PTSD, and that Alexis had been an active participant in rescue attempts on September 11th, 2001. Barack Obama has issued a presidential proclamation honourig the victims of the shooting at the Washington navy yard. The president has ordered for flags to be lowered to half-staff at all public buildings and military posts. Full text: As a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of violence perpetrated on September 16, 2013, at the Washington Navy Yard, by the authority vested in me as President of the United States by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby order that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff at the White House and upon all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions until sunset, September 20, 2013. I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same length of time at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations. Aaron Alexis, who the FBI have identified as the gunman in the navy yard shooting, was a \"sweet\" man who never \"talked about anything violent\", according to customers of the Happy Bowl thai restaurant where Alexis worked in Fort Worth, Texas. Sandy Guerra-Cline, who works as a copy editor at the Star-Telegram newspaper in Fort Worth, said she had been served by Alexis in his job waiting tables at the restaurant. \"[Alexis was] really a sweet and intelligent guy who told us that he had moved to Fort Worth with the military, kind of decided to stay on after working at Carswell,\" she said. \"He was an ex-airman. Still had that military bearing about him but very sweet, is not a guy that talked about guns or talked about anything violent. As a matter of fact my best memories of him were him sitting at one of the tables at Happy Bowl trying to teach himself Thai.\" The owner of the restaurant, Nutpisit Suthamtewakul, told the Star-Telegram that Alexis was his \"best friend\". \u201cHe lived with me three years,\u201d Suthamtewakul said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019d do this. He has a gun, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s that stupid. He didn\u2019t seem aggressive to me.\u201d The US Navy has confirmed that the deceased gunman responsible for Monday's shooting at the Washington navy yard is a former sailor, Spencer Ackerman reports: Aaron Alexis, 34, served in the US Navy from May 2007 to January 2011, according to Rear Admiral John Kirby, the Navy's chief of information. Alexis, whose home of record is listed as New York City, was a Navy aviation electrician's mate 3rd class. From February 1 2008 until his detachment from the Navy on January 31 2011, Alexis was assigned to Fleet Logistics Support Squadron (VR) 46, in Fort Worth, Texas. Numerous media reports cited a gun-related arrest for Alexis in Forth Worth in 2010. The FBI, which is now leading the investigation, is still determining how Alexis got onto the Washington navy yard installation. According to a Navy document, Alexis is not listed as having served overseas, but is listed as receiving the National Defense Service Medal and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. DC police had identified two other \"potential suspects\" early on Monday, but have since ruled out one of them. They continue to search for a second man who could be connected to the shooting. \"We can confirm that the deceased shooter from this morning has been identified as 34-year-old Aaron Alexis,\" said Valerie Parlave, assistant director in charge of the FBI Washington DC field office. The FBI has posted pictures of Alexis on the \"seeking information\" section of its website. Parlave appealed for information from people who recognise Alexis. \"No piece of information is too small. We are looking to learn everything we can about his movements and his associates,\" she said. An FBI team is now moving in at the navy yard \"to process the scene\", Parlave said. \"Again, we ask the public to look at the photos of the deceased shooter and to contact the FBI with any information.\" DC mayor Vincent Gray says 13 people are now confirmed dead following the shooting, including the gunman. The total had been 12 but a victim died at hospital, Gray said. The mayor confirms that one of the potential suspects has been ruled out: \"There is no reason to continue\" to think that one of the suspects has been involved, Gray says. Police are continuing to look for the second man \"to determine what if any involvement he may have had\". Gray says the second potential suspect was \"seen in a video\". \"We don't have any reason at this stage to suspect terrorism,\" Gray says but they will work to rule it out. The three injured victims being treated at MedStar Washington Hospital Center are all expected to make good recoveries, according to the hospital's chief medical officer Janis Orlowski. Orlowski said the male victim \u2013 who she earlier identified as a police officer \u2013 has \"been in surgery for several hours and we expect that surgery to continue\". \"He is expected to make a good recovery,\" she said. Orlowski said a second victim who has a shoulder wound is also in surgery. She will remain in surgery for a couple of hours. The third victim, a woman who was shot in the head and in the hand \"will not have surgery\" Orlowski said. \"She is a very, very, lucky young lady,\" she said. The bullet \"did not penetrate the skull \u2013 that means it did not penetrate the bone,\" Orlowski said. The victim \"will recover without surgery\". Multiple news organisations including NBC, AP, CNN, the Washington Post and the New York Times have identified the dead gunman as Aaron Alexis, 34, a military contractor from Texas. Reports suggest Alexis was positively identified from a photo ID removed from his body. The next police update is due shortly. A number of streets are still closed in DC. The district department of transport has issued this map showing some of the main closures. Naval Sea Systems Command employees remain on lockdown: The Senate is to be shut down while uncertainty continues over the navy yard shooting, according to Senate officials. A number of DC reporters say the lockdown will last for the next two hours. DC police have eliminated one \"potential suspect\" from their enquiries, but have yet to locate a second man who they said could be involved. The US navy has issued an \"order to account\" for all navy uniformed personnel following the shootings this morning. The order applies to \"both active duty and selected reserve, assigned to commands in the DC metro area. The order also applies to family members, navy civilian employees, as well as, NAF and NEX personnel.\" One of the two men DC police had identified as potential suspects is no longer a person of interest. Just 30 minutes ago DC police chief Cathy Lanier said police were hunting two men in connection with the shooting. \"We have reason to believe these people are involved and we need to talk to them,\" she told reporters. It now appears that police have been able to rule one of the men out of their enquiries: Secretary of defense Chuck Hagel has issued a statement in response to the shootings. I have been receiving regular updates on the shooting at the Washington Navy Yard, and continue to monitor the situation closely. This is a tragic day for the Department of Defense, the national capital area, and the nation. My thoughts and prayers are with the victims of this outrageous act of violence, their families, and all those affected by today's events. I am grateful for the swift response of federal and local law enforcement, and for the professionalism of DoD personnel at the Navy Yard complex. The Department of Defense will continue to offer its full assistance in the investigation of this terrible and senseless violence. Twitter user @Gerritt is among those who are on lockdown in the US navy yard. Earlier he tweeted a picture as employees evacuated, now he posts this from the navy yard food court where staff are waiting for the yard to be secured. DC police chief Cathy Lanier said earlier that it could be two hours before the site is secured. DC police chief Cathy Lanier confirmed that there are \"at least 12 fatalities\". Lanier reiterated that police are looking for two more potential suspects. \"Right now we have multiple pieces of information that would suggest we have at least two other individuals that were seen with firearms,\" she said. \"These are people that we really believe are involved in some way.\" Asked why police believe there are two additional gunmen, Lanier repeated: \"We have reason to believe these people are involved and we need to talk to them.\" Lanier said there were \"a few additional folks who were injured\" besides the 12 dead. \"They were not fatally injured,\" she said of the other victims. More than one police officer has been injured, Lanier said, but \"only one was injured by gunfire\". She did not specify the nature of the other injuries to police. Lanier repeated that police are looking for information on two men. One is a white male \"between 40 and 50\" wearing a tan military-style uniform consistent with navy uniform\", she said. \"We also have a lookout\" for a black male in an olive military\u2013style uniform, Lanier said. That man is approximately 5'10\" with grey sideburns, she said. DC Mayor Vincent Gray says there are \"at least 12 fatalities\". There is \"no known motive at this stage\", he says. \"We also don't know if there were other\" gunmen, he said. The \"shelter-in-place\" at the Washington Navy Yard \u2013 the order for employees to stay where they are \u2013 is still in effect four hours after today's mass shooting began, my colleague Spencer Ackerman reports: A navy official confirmed that sailors and civilians assigned to the Washington navy yard, as well as all personnel assigned to the nearby Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling, are advised to stay put while authorities continue to investigate the scene. Police are still searching Building 197 at the navy yard, the site of today's violence, which has left several people dead and others injured. \u2022 One gunman is dead after a number of people were shot at the US navy yard on Monday morning, police said. DC police chief Cathy Lanier said a suspect was deceased, but details remain unclear. Lanier told reports that police \"potentially have two other shooters that we have not located at this point\". \u2022 The two other potential suspects are both male and were wearing military-style clothing, Lanier said. One of the men was white and was last seen at \"around 8.35am this morning with a handgun,\" she said. The second man was black, around 50-years-old, and was carrying a rifle. Police are appealing for information on the men. \u2022 \"Multiple victims\" were killed in the shooting, Lanier said. She did not give exact numbers of the dead. Three victims were taken to MedStar Washington Hospital Center, were all three were in a critical condition, the hospital's chief medical officer Janis Orlowski said. The three were expected to survive. \u2022 A police officer is among those injured, with multiple gunshot wounds to his legs, Orlowski said. She said the man had injuries to \"bones and blood vessels in his legs\". The other two MedStar patients were female. One had been shot in her shoulder, the other in her head and hand. \u2022 Eye-witnesses recalled how a gunman had fired at them in the Naval Sea Systems Command Headquarters building. One man, who was not named, told CNN that as he and his colleagues left the building \"we noticed him down the hall\". The witness added: \"As he came round the corner he aimed his gun at us and he fired at least two or three shots.\" \u2022 President Obama said the victims had faced \"unimaginable violence\" and offered his condolences to their families. \"We will honour their service to the nation we helped to make great,\" Obama said. \"Obviously we will investigate thoroughly what has happened, as we have so many of these shootings that has happened sadly.\" \u2022 Security has been increased at the Pentagon as a \"proactive, precautionary measure\". Department of defense spokesman George Little described the shooting as \"a fluid situation\". He said navy officials are working with law enforcement and the FBI \"to secure the scene and begin the investigation\". DC police have issued more detail on the men they are seeking in connection with the shooting. Anyone with information is urged to call police at the numbers below. In this agency video Patricia Ward, a logistics management specialist, describes the moment shots were fired at the Washington Navy Yard. Paul Lewis quoted Ward in this post earlier today. More from George Little: Department of defense press secretary George Little has issued this statement: Everyone here at the Department of Defense is saddened by the incident at the Washington Navy Yard this morning. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims. Secretary Hagel is closely following the situation and has assured the Navy we will provide any resource or capability needed to get the Washington Navy Yard community through this event. The commander of the Military District of Washington is determining the operational and security status of military installations in the National Capital Region. Individual installation commanders have the authority to change their operating status at their discretion. While the Pentagon remains open, the Pentagon Force Protection Agency increased its security posture, not out of a specific threat, but as a proactive, precautionary measure. This is a fluid situation. Navy officials are working closely with law enforcement and emergency management representatives from the FBI and the District of Columbia to secure the scene and begin the investigation. More information will be released from the appropriate agency as it becomes available. President Obama has offered his condolences to the families of the shooting victims. I've been briefed by my team on the situation. We still don't know all the facts, but we do know that several people have been shot and some people have been killed. \"It's a shooting that targeted our military and civilian personnel. These are men and women [...] doing their job and going to work. They're patriots.\" He added: \"Today they faced unimaginable violence that they wouldn't have expected here at home.\" \"I've made it clear to my team that I want the investigation to be seamless,\" the president said, with federal and local teams working together. \"We thank them for their service. We stand by the families of those who have been harmed,\" Obama said. \"We will honour their service to the nation we helped to make great. Obviously we will investigate thoroughly what has happened, as we have so many of these shootings that has happened sadly.\" \"This investigation is still very active,\" Washington DC police chief Cathy Lanier said in a press conference. \"We potentially have two other shooters that we have not located at this point.\" Lanier confirmed that one shooter was deceased. She added that \"multiple victims\" had been killed \u2013 but would not give a number of the deceased. In a signal of the chaotic scene, Lanier said it was \"not confirmed\" that there were two other shooters. She said one of the men police were looking for was a \"white male in military fatigues\". \"He was last seen around 8.35am this morning with a handgun,\" she said. \"We also have a lookout for potentially another shooter who was involved,\" Lanier said. She described the second man as black and wearing a military-style fatigues. \"We do have information that those individuals are wearing military-style uniforms,\" she said. Lanier urged anyone with information on the two men to call the police. She said police received the first call with information on the shooting shortly after 8.15am. A police team was deployed \"within 7 minutes of the first call coming in,\" Lanier said. The Washington DC police chief, Cathy Lanier, says the incident may have involved up to three gunmen. She confirms that one is dead, and police are searching for two others. \"We potentially have two shooters out there,\" she said. \"We have one shooter that we believe is involved in this who is deceased,\" she said. \"We have multiple victims inside who are deceased,\" Lanier added. She would not give numbers of the dead. Washington DC's mayor, Vincent Gray, says \"we're still trying to confirm the number of fatalities\". An update from Paul Lewis, on the scene in DC: Gwen Crump, a spokesman for Washington DC Metropolitan Police Department, says the police chief Cathy L Lanier giving a press conference around 12.05pm, outside the Navy Yard. She will be joined by the Mayor and Deputy Mayor. She dismissed rumours of a second shooting at Bolling Air Force Base. The US Navy has an updated statement on the shooting with information for those whose family may have been involved in the incident. Washington D.C. Metro Police Deptartment advises family members of Washington Navy Yard employees may meet their loved ones at Nationals Stadium. [Specifically] Lot B, South Capitol &amp; N St SE Family members looking for information about their loved ones can contact the Warfighter and Family Support Center at 202-433-6151 or 202-433-9713. Several people were injured and there are reports of fatalities in a shooting at the Washington Navy Yard September 16. Three people are in a critical condition at MedStar Washington Hospital Center, according to the hospital's chief medical officer Janis Orlowski. In a press conference just now Orlowski confirmed there were fatalities at the scene but did not say how many people had been killed. She said the three victims at MedStar are \"alert and responsive\". \"They are able to talk to us. They do have severe injuries but we have been able to speak with all of them,\" she said. \"Obviously they are in pain and in distress because of what they suffered this morning,\" Orlowski added. \"One metropolitan police officer is here, the other two are civilians,\" she said. \"We understand there is potentially another metropolitan police officer at the scene, but we have no confirmation of that.\" Orlowski said all three were in a critical condition. The police officer, a male, has \"multiple gunshot wounds to his legs\", she said, with injuries to \"bones and blood vessels in his legs\". The other two injured people are both women, Orlowski said. One has a wound to the shoulder, the other has injuries to her hand and head. \"Their chances for survival are very good,\" Orlowski said. She said she did not know yet if any more injured people would be coming to the MedStar hospital but confirmed people had been killed at the navy yard. \"We understand there are individuals at the scene who will not be transported [to the hospital] because they are deceased.\" Orlowski said medical staff believe the three patients were shot with a semi-automatic rifle. Ray Mabus, the US secretary of the navy, has issued his first comments on the shooting. Mabus tweeted just now saying he was \"shocked and saddened\" by the situation. Here's a gallery of images from the US navy yard. The picture below shows a number of navy yard employees congregating beneath ground. My colleague Paul Lewis has spoken to an eyewitness at the navy yard in DC: Patricia Ward, 53, a logistics specialist at the Navy, said she was in the canteen when the shooting took place on the fourth floor. \"I heard the first three shots: 'Pow pow pow'. A few seconds later: 'Pop pop pop' \u2013 four more shots. And then everyone in the cafeteria just started running. We panicked as we didn't know which door to use. One lady said stay in the cafeteria but I just said no. We didn't scream, we were just in shocking, running, running.\" Ward ran out of the building an right blocks down M Street. \"People were just flying out of the office. There was probably twenty or thirty people just running.\" \u2022 Several people have been killed in a shooting at the US navy yard in Washington DC on Monday morning, police and defense officials said. \u2022 \"We believe there has been loss of life and several injuries,\" Pentagon press secretary George Little told reporters. Ed Buclatin, director of public affairs at the Navy Installations Command in DC said that four people have been killed and eight injured. \u2022 Witnesses told CNN a gunman opened fire on them in the Naval Sea Systems Command Headquarters building within the US navy yard. \"As he came round the corner he aimed his gun at us and he fired at least two or three shots,\" one man said. \u2022 President Obama and defense secretary Chuck Hagel have been briefed on the situation. \"The President directed his team to stay in touch with our federal partners, including the Navy and FBI, as well as the local officials,\" the White House said in a statement. \u2022 Schools have been closed in the immediate area. Flights at Reagan National Airport were temporarily suspended following the shooting but have since resumed service. Spencer Ackerman, Guardian US national security editor, sends this update from the Pentagon: \"We believe there has been loss of life and several injuries,\" said Pentagon press secretary George Little to reporters. Little had no information about any arrests made at the Washington Navy Yard. Little said Secretary Chuck Hagel was receiving \"regular updates\" about the \"ongoing\" shooter situation at Building 197 in the Washington Navy Yard in southeast Washington. One was ongoing at 10.30am. Little did not identify any of the casualties or specify of they are sailor or civilian. Nor did he say he knew if one or multiple shooters took part in the deadly situation. It is also unknown as yet what weapons the shooter or shooters used. Little would not speculate on any motive for the assault, citing the fluid situation. Army Col Steve Warren, another Pentagon spokesman, said he expected \"all regional military facilities\" to take \"prudent steps\" to secure their installations, but there are no reports as yet of an attack elsewhere. Nor have regional bases been put on lockdown. Security at the Pentagon this morning did not appear different from any other day. The Guardian's DC correspondent Paul Lewis is on the scene at the US navy yard: CNN has just interviewed two eye witnesses who said a gunman fired towards them this morning in the US navy yard. One of the witnesses, who CNN did not name, said a man had fired at a group of people. \"The fire alarm went off first... I was on the phone and someone came over and said hey this is not a fire alarm, someone has been shot in the building,\" the man said. As we were exiting the backdoor we noticed him down the hall. He stepped around the corner and we heard shots. As he came round the corner he aimed his gun at us and he fired at least two or three shots. \"There was a group of us. He aimed the gun and fired our way,\" the man said. Four people have been killed and eight injured, according to the director of public affairs at the Navy Installations Command in DC. Ed Buclatin reported that one gunman is down. He said his information was coming from a navy watch team. An image from the scene. Fox 5 is the Fox News affiliate in DC. The Guardian's Washington correspondent Paul Lewis has more information on the site of the shooting: The Navy Yard is a secure military facility and it would be unusual for a non-staff member without credentials to be permitted onto the site. Clearance and security ID are typically required to access the base. Many of the streets surrounding the Yard, which is the south-west of the city, beside the Anacostia River, is in lockdown. Helicopters were hovering above the scene and there was a huge police presence near the Yard, a complex of several buildings near the Nationals baseball stadium, around a mile from Capitol Hill. Flights from Reagan Airport, located across the river, have been temporarily suspended. The Associated Press, citing a defense official, reports that \"several\" people have been killed in the shooting. The US Navy tweeted a few minutes ago that there were \"reports of fatalities\". The White House has issued a statement on the shooting. It says President Obama has been briefed on the situation. Full text: The President has been briefed several times about the unfolding situation at the Washington Navy Yard by Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Lisa Monaco and Deputy Chief of Staff Alyssa Mastromanaco. The President directed his team to stay in touch with our federal partners, including the Navy and FBI, as well as the local officials. We urge citizens to listen to the authorities and follow directions from the first responders on site. Police say 10 people have been shot, according to the Washington Post. The newspaper says eight civilians and two police officers have been wounded. A DC police officer was shot two times in the leg; a base officer was also shot. Police say the shooter is pinned down between the third and fourth floors of a building on the base. The US Navy says there are \"reports of fatalities\" following the shooting at the navy yard in Washington DC. It is not immediately clear what the navy means by \"reports\". The US Navy has confirmed that \"several people\" have been injured in a shooting at the US navy yard in DC. \"An active shooter was reported inside the Naval Sea Systems Command Headquarters building (Bldg. 197) on the Washington Navy Yard at 8.20am (Eastern Time),\" the navy said in a release on its website. The navy said that employees at the scene had been ordered to \"shelter in place\". The statement on its website was last updated at 9.42am.
