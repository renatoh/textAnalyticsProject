That result was from a wastewater test, not a test of an individual, and was likely linked to a known cluster from that area. In Queensland, Australia, the state has reported one new case of Covid-19 of a man who was in day 10 of being in hotel quarantine. The state\u2019s chief health officer, Jeanette Young, says that testing of sewage near Townsville has returned a positive result, and is now warning anyone there to watch symptoms closely and get tested. \u201cWe know we haven\u2019t had cases in Townsville for quite some time ... months,\u201d she said. The next presidential debate between President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden planned for 15 October now won\u2019t go ahead, according to the Commission on Presidential Debates in a statement to Reuters. The CPD said both campaigns had announced \u201calternate plans for that date\u201d. \u201cIt is now apparent there will be no debate on October 15, and the CPD will turn its attention to preparations for the final presidential debate scheduled for October 22,\u201d the commission said in an emailed statement. Saturday\u2019s Guardian front page in the UK. A federal judge has refused to block New York\u2019s plan to temporarily limit the size of religious gatherings in Covid-19 hot spots. US district judge Judge Kiyo Matsumoto issued the ruling on Friday after an emergency hearing in a lawsuit brought by rabbis and synagogues that argued the restrictions were unconstitutional. They had sought to have enforcement delayed until at least after Jewish holy days this weekend. The rules limit indoor prayer services to 10 people in areas where the virus is spreading fastest. In other areas with slower spread, indoor religious services are capped at 25 people. The restrictions apply in six designated virus hot spots statewide, in parts of New York City, Rockland and Orange counties, and part of Binghamton. Nonessential businesses and schools have also been shut down in some of those areas. Ruling from the bench, the judge said the state had an interest in protecting public safety. Rabbis, leaders of synagogues and the national Orthodox Jewish group Agudath Israel sued, arguing that governor Andrew Cuomo was \u201csingling out\u201d Jews amid the ongoing Sukkot festival and this weekend\u2019s Simchat Torah, which marks the annual cycle of reading the Torah. \u201cThat targeting of a religious minority on the eve of its holidays is reason enough to reject all of defendant\u2019s arguments and allow plaintiffs to celebrate their holidays this weekend as they have for over 2,000 years,\u201d the groups argued in a Friday court filing. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn also sued in a challenge to the restrictions. Victoria has reported 14 new coronavirus cases and no deaths in the past 24 hours. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, is expected to give a further update this morning in what will be his 100th consecutive day of fronting up to the media. Melbourne has been in a hard lockdown since early July as the state experienced a second wave of the coronavirus. While restrictions have eased in regional areas of the state, in the city a five-kilometre movement restriction for only essential travel and gathering bans remain. That lockdown will stay unless the city\u2019s rolling 14-day average drops to five cases or less, with only five cases of community transmission over that same time. The average right now is 9.4. On Friday the state recorded 11 cases and no deaths. In NSW, that state recorded five new local cases on Friday but these were all linked to a known cluster. A health alert was issued late Friday when a nurse at St Vincent\u2019s Hospital in Sydney tested posted. The nurse \u201chad limited contact with a very small number of colleagues\u201d, health authorities said. The opening of state borders continues to create political tension in Australia. Queensland, which has only four people currently with the virus, is relatively open, and has its border closed to most of New South Wales and all of Victoria. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, and the Australian prime minister, Scott Morriso,n have both been trying to pressure Queensland to open up. Queensland is in election mode, with polls closing on 31 October. Saturday\u2019s FT. A selection of some of the UK front pages on Saturday now, starting with The Times. Unsung heroes of the Covid-19 pandemic make up almost a third of the Queen\u2019s birthday honours list in the UK. US Department of Health and Human Services has signed an agreement with AstraZeneca Plc for development and supply of the company\u2019s Covid-19 antibody treatment, a cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies, a similar class of drugs that was administered to President Donald Trump. The agency will provide nearly $486 million to AstraZeneca for two Phase 3 clinical trials as well as a large-scale manufacturing demonstration project and supply of AZD7442 doses in the US. The death toll in Brazil from coronavirus has reached a total of 149,639 compared to 148,957 yesterday, the country\u2019s health ministry said. Brazil has also registered 5,055,888 cases, up from 5,028,444 yesterday. In Australia, a Sydney nurse at St Vincent\u2019s hospital has tested positive for coronavirus. It is believed the nurse provided specialised care to a single patient and had limited contact with a small number of colleagues. NSW Health says people who attended Westfield Parramatta at times on 6 and 7 October are considered casual contacts of the nurse and should monitor for symptoms. An open letter in the UK that made headlines calling for a herd immunity approach to Covid-19 lists a number of apparently fake names among its expert signatories, including \u201cDr Johnny Bananas\u201d and \u201cProfessor Cominic Dummings\u201d. The Great Barrington declaration, which was said to have been signed by more than 15,000 scientists and medical practitioners around the world, was found to contain numerous false names, as well as those of several homeopaths. US President Donald Trump said he could have become very ill and might not have recovered from Covid-19 without experimental drugs, a far worse outlook than what his doctors were telling the American people. \u201cI was asking the doctors today ... and I said, How bad was I?\u2019 They said: You could have been very bad. You were going into a very bad phase,\u2019\u201d Trump told Rush Limbaugh during his radio show. \u201cIt looked like it was going to be a big deal and you know what that means, right? That means bad because I\u2019ve lost five people,\u201d he added, referring to acquaintances who have died. Trump said that after contracting the virus, he was \u201cnot in the greatest of shape.\u201d He added that \u201cI might not have recovered at all\u201d without treatment with experimental drugs. His comments on the seriousness of his coronavirus contrast with generally upbeat public statements about his condition that his doctors released after his diagnosis and while he was hospitalised. The White House said Trump\u2019s being admitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center last week was precautionary and his symptoms were mild. Trump is expected to hold first rally since his diagnosis on Monday in Florida. Two migrants died after entering Panama through the border with Colombia, one from coronavirus, Panamanian authorities said. The National Immigration Service said both migrants, one from Mauritania and the other from Haiti, entered Panama in early October and both died on Thursday. The Mauritanian Sall Abdulaye Mamdou, 28, was taken to a government outpost in the Darien region without vital signs. A test for Covid-19 came back positive. The cause of death was not provided for Bana Saint Halaine of Haiti, 50, who entered Panama with a group of fellow Haitians. Panama had previously reported the deaths of two other migrants during the pandemic. There are some 2,000 migrants in government camps in Darien and another 500 in a camp near the Costa Rica border. The majority are Haitians halted in their journey to the United States by the pandemic. Pfizer Inc and Germany\u2019s BioNTech SE said they have started a rolling submission to Health Canada for their experimental Covid-19 vaccine. The companies said under the rolling submission they would submit safety and efficacy data from trial of their Covid-19 vaccine to Canada\u2019s health ministry when it becomes available. The World Health Organization has reported a new daily high in Covid-19 cases. The global tally reached more than 350,000 cases on Friday, surpassing a record set earlier this week by nearly 12,000 infections. The number of coronavirus infections in France jumped over 20,000 in one day for the first time since the start of the pandemic, health ministry data showed. The ministry reported 20,330 new infections, taking the total to 691,977 since the start of the year. In the past two days the ministry had reported more than 18,000 daily new confirmed Covid-19 cases. UK prime minister Boris Johnson will make a statement on Monday setting out new coronavirus outbreak restrictions, the PA news agency understands. Johnson will use the occasion to outline a new \u201ctiered\u201d approach to how local Covid situations will be treated. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, warned the country had reached a \u201ctipping point\u201d as it battles a second wave of the coronavirus. In revised modelling, the federal anticipates cumulative deaths could reach between 9,690 and 9,800 by 17 October, with 188,150 to 197,830 infections. Daily infections in Italy have topped 5,000 for the first time since March. On Friday, the country recorded 5,372 new Covid-19 cases, the first time more than 5,000 infections have been recorded in a single day by the country since 29 March. Spain has declared a state of emergency to keep Madrid in partial lockdown measures. Health minister Salvador Illa said the restrictions would remain in place in the capital for a fortnight after 63 people died from Covid-19 in the region in the last week. Poland has reported a record daily rise in infections for the fourth day in a row. The country recorded 4,739 new cases on Friday, ahead of masks becoming mandatory in all public places from Saturday. Europe has recorded 100,000 daily coronavirus cases for the first time. Infections in the continent passed 100,000 on Thursday after a steady rise over the past week. The UK, Russia, Spain and France have reported over 10,000 cases each in the last three days. UK prime minister Boris Johnson will make a statement on Monday setting out new coronavirus outbreak restrictions, the PA news agency understands. Johnson will use the occasion to outline a new \u201ctiered\u201d approach to how local Covid situations will be treated. US President Donald Trump is feeling great and eager to get back out on the road once he is cleared by doctors treating him for Covid-19, White House spokeswoman Alyssa Farah insisted. \u201cThe president is doing great ... He\u2019s feeling great. He\u2019s eager to get back out on the road safely once he\u2019s been cleared by his doctors,\u201d Farah said of Trump, who tested positive for coronavirus last week. Cape Verde is set to reopen its borders on Monday, the government said, after the coronavirus pandemic forced the archipelago state to close to visitors for months. Visitors to the West African country will have to provide proof of a negative coronavirus result from a high-precision molecular test, known as a PCR test. \u201cThe government has decided that the time has come to restore full air links with the outside world,\u201d Transport Minister Carlos Santos said during a press conference. Cruise ships and commercial vessels will also be able to dock in Cape Verde from Monday, he added. Sunseekers have traditionally flocked to the 10-island archipelago, where tourism represents about a quarter of its GDP. The former Portuguese colony\u2019s high season falls over the winter months. The government banned commercial flights after the outbreak of the pandemic, but initial plans to lift the restrictions in July were delayed. Health officials in Cape Verde have since recorded some 6,700 coronavirus cases to date, including 71 fatalities. Transport Minister Santos said the country had strengthened its testing capabilities ahead of its reopening, including establishing testing centres on the islands of Sal and Boa Vista. Mosques reopened in and around the Libyan capital, Tripoli, almost seven months after they were ordered to close as part of strict curbs to rein in the Covid-19 pandemic. Libya has seen a surge in contaminations since its first coronavirus case in March. According to the latest official figures, there have been more than 41,000 confirmed cases of the virus and 621 deaths in Libya, a country of less than seven million people. The UN-recognised Government of National Accord based in Tripoli authorised the reopening of mosques, but with conditions. Mosques in Tripoli and nearby towns reopened for prayers, with the faithful wearing face masks and observing social distancing. They also brought their own rugs. The imam of Jaafar bin Abi Talib mosque in the western suburb of Janzour told AFP an awareness campaign was launched before the reopening. \u201cWe distributed leaflets explaining the conditions under which prayers can resume in the mosques in line with the government\u2019s guidelines,\u201d Abdel Monem al-Rayani said. The guidelines restrict numbers in mosques for prayers to half pre-coronavirus levels, he said. Mosques which fail to comply with government restrictions would be shut. Morocco\u2019s King Mohammed VI called for a \u201cgeneral mobilisation\u201d to confront the coronavirus crisis and its dire economic impact on the country in a video message broadcast in parliament. \u201cTo confront this unprecedented crisis, to stand up to the challenges arising from it, requires a national general mobilisation,\u201d he said. The 57-year-old monarch said his traditional speech for the opening of parliament was being made remotely because of the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d in the north African country. Morocco on Friday declared a daily record of 3,445 new cases of Covid-19, raising the total number of confirmed contaminations to 146,398, including 2,530 deaths. At the end of last month, the central bank forecast 6.3% recession in 2020 due to a \u201cslower than anticipated\u201d economic upturn and the closure of Morocco\u2019s borders that has denied the country vital tourism revenues. A medical state of emergency in force in Morocco since mid-March has been extended until November 10. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, warned the country had reached a \u201ctipping point\u201d as it battles a second wave of the coronavirus. \u201cI know this is discouraging ... the increase in new cases is putting an enormous pressure on hospitals and health care workers, who are more and more swamped,\u201d Trudeau said Friday, pleading with residents to download the country\u2019s Covid-19 alert app, which notifies users of possible exposures to the virus. With the country\u2019s Thanksgiving long weekend approaching, health officials have asked residents to refrain from gathering with friends and family to prevent new transmission. In revised modelling, the federal anticipates cumulative deaths could reach between 9,690 and 9,800 by October 17, with 188,150 to 197,830 infections. Almost 80% of the cases have been recorded in Ontario and Quebec, the two most populous provinces. On Friday, Quebec logged 1,102 new cases. Its two largest cities, Montreal and Quebec City, have been designated \u201cred zones\u201d by health officials and have restrictions on businesses, including bars and restaurants. Ontario reported 939 new Covid-19 cases on Friday, its highest number ever during the pandemic. The province is expected to shut down indoor dining, gyms and casinos. Schools and preschools will remain open. Earlier in the week, Premier Doug Ford said he wouldn\u2019t close thousands of businesses in the province\u2014many of whom are facing dire financial prospects\u2014 because of a few \u201cbad apples\u201d. The new restrictions will take effect at midnight and apply to Toronto, Ottawa and Peel region, and apply to nearly seven million people. Health officials warned on Friday that Ontario\u2019s updated modelling shows that without drastic action the province could experience \u201cworst-case scenarios\u201d similar to northern Italy and New York City, where hospitals were overwhelmed and logged high death tolls. The World Health Organization has reported a new daily high in Covid-19 cases. The global tally reached more than 350,000 cases on Friday, surpassing a record set earlier this week by nearly 12,000 infections. The WHO\u2019s emergencies chief, Dr Michael Ryan, acknowledged even as Covid-19 continues to surge across the world, \u201cthere are no new answers\u201d. He said that although the agency wants countries to avoid the punishing lockdowns that have devastated economies, governments must ensure the most vulnerable people are protected and that numerous measures must be taken. The number of coronavirus infections in France jumped over 20,000 in one day for the first time since the start of the epidemic, health ministry data showed. The ministry reported 20,330 new infections, taking the total to 691,977 since the start of the year. In the past two days the ministry had reported more than 18,000 daily new confirmed Covid-19 cases. The number of deaths from the virus increased by 109 to 32,630, the highest in a week but below highs of around 150 seen earlier this month. However, the death toll figures can be skewed as the ministry often reports several days of senior citizen residence data in one batch Here\u2019s a summary of the key global coronavirus developments over the last few hours: Daily infections in Italy have topped 5,000 for the first time since March. On Friday, the country recorded 5,372 new Covid-19 cases, the first time more than 5,000 infections have been recorded in a single day by the country since 29 March. Spain has declared a state of emergency to keep Madrid in partial lockdown measures. Health minister Salvador Illa said the restrictions would remain in place in the capital for a fortnight after 63 people died from Covid-19 in the region in the last week. Poland has reported a record daily rise in infections for the fourth day in a row. The country recorded 4,739 new cases on Friday, ahead of masks becoming mandatory in all public places from Saturday. Europe has recorded 100,000 daily coronavirus cases for the first time. Infections in the continent passed 100,000 on Thursday after a steady rise over the past week. The UK, Russia, Spain and France have reported over 10,000 cases each in the last three days. Poland has reported a record daily rise in coronavirus infections for the fourth consecutive day, with 4,739 new cases, ahead of some restrictions being renewed in the country from Saturday. Wearing masks outside will be compulsory across Poland, while a tightening of measures in schools is also expected to be announced. On Thursday, prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki did not rule out introducing a state of emergency if the number of cases continues to grow. In total, the country of 38 million has reported 116,338 Covid-19 infections and 2,919 deaths. The World Health Organisation\u2019s top emergencies expert has said authorities should try to avoid \u201cpunishing\u201d lockdowns, as many countries see a sharp rise in Covid-19 infections. Mike Ryan was speaking at a briefing in Geneva on Friday, the day after the WHO reported a record one-day increase in global coronavirus cases, with the total rising by 338,779 in 24 hours led by a surge of infections in Europe. \u201cWhat we want to try to avoid - and sometimes it\u2019s unavoidable and we accept that - but what we want to try and avoid is these massive lockdowns that are so punishing to communities, to society and to everything else,\u201d he said. US President Donald Trump has approved a revised Covid-19 relief stimulus, White House Economic Advisor Larry Kudlow has said. Stocks immediately rallied on the news, Bloomberg News tweets, while the president himself (or one of his staff) has has also been on Twitter in the last few minutes Follow our US blog here for more details of those developments and coverage of the reaction to the announcement by House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi of a Commission on Presidential Capacity that would exist to evaluate the health of the president in a time of crisis and assess whether a transition of power to the vice president would be suitable. Most people in the UK who have Covid-19 or are a contact of somebody who has tested positive fail to fully self-isolate, despite its necessity in preventing a resurgence of the pandemic, according to government advisors. Newly released papers reveal that behavioural science experts privately warned last month that only 18-25% of people who needed to were self-isolating. Others were still going out to work or to shop, even though they risked infecting others, according to the details of the briefing for ministers by the UK government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) . In a paper dated 16 September, they called for financial support primarily for low earners, but also in middle-income groups. Food and help with obtaining medical and other supplies would also be essential, they said. Specific details are expected to be made available next week in relation to the volumes of vaccines available under the WHO-led Covax distribution scheme, today\u2019s WHO briefing has been told. Italy\u2019s coronavirus infections eclipsed 5,000 on Friday, and there there were 28 new fatalities. Daily cases have galloped in recent days, jumping by over 900 to 5,372 in the last 24 hours. Lombardy registered the highest number of infections - 983 - taking over from Campania in the south, where 769 cases were registered in a day. Concerns are a mounting over the ability of hospitals in the south, which managed to avoid a drastic first phase of the pandemic, to cope. A doctor\u2019s association warned on Friday that if cases continue to increase at the same pace as in recent days then intensive care units, especially in Campania and Lazio, the region surrounding the Italian capital, would be struggling within the next month-and-a- half unless further containment measures are introduced. Supplies of vaccines will be limited at first but states that are part of the WHO-led Covax distrubution scheme can distribute vaccines simultaneously to priority populations, including health workers, the director generatl of the World Health Organisation, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. He\u2019s hosting a WHO media briefing at the moment, which you can follow live here. A move by China to join the World Health Organisation\u2019s vaccine distribution scheme is being viewed by many as another exampke of Beijing taking a more assertive leadership role as the US relinquishes its role, according to the South China Morning Post. It quotes commentators including Mely Caballero-Anthony, head of the Centre for Non-Traditional Security Studies at Singapore\u2019s Nanyang Technological University, who said the decision to take a multilateral path and join the WHO-led Covax scheme to share a vaccine fairly added \u201cmore credibility\u201d to China\u2019s promise for the vaccine to be a global public good. She added: [It\u2019s also] significant as it not only increases the number of countries helping this facility to provide for equitable access and distribution of vaccines, but strengthens the ability to help countries, particularly developing ones. In the US, the Republican Party\u2019s leader in the senate has said that the White House and Congress were unlikely to reach a deal on a Covid-19 economic stimulus ahead of the US presidential election on November 3. \u201cWe do need another rescue package. But the proximity to the election and the differences of opinion what is needed at this particular juncture are pretty vast,\u201d Mitch McConnell told a news conference in his home state of Kentucky. The leading Republican in Congress, McConnell said he hoped lawmakers could rise above partisan jockeying to agree on \u201chopefully one last rescue package,\u201d but added: \u201cI think that\u2019s unlikely in the next three weeks.\u201d President Donald Trump had showed renewed interest in forging a deal after withdrawing his administration earlier this week from talks with House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the leading Democrat in Congress. This is Ben Quinn picking up the blog for a while now as Amy Walker takes a break. Italy has recorded 5,372 new Covid-19 cases, the first time more than 5,000 infections have been recorded in a single day by the country since 29 March. Europe surpassed 100,000 daily reported Covid-19 cases for the first time on Thursday. Cases throughout the continent have been steadily rising over the past week even as new infections in worst-affected countries such as India and Brazil have shown signs of slowing down. The focus of the outbreak in the European region has moved to the UK, Russia, Spain and France, which have reported at least over 10,000 cases each in the last three days. Russia reported its highest daily coronavirus cases ever since the last record in May on Friday, prompting Moscow authorities to mull closing bars and nightclubs. The UK recorded more than 17,000 cases on Thursday, with the health minister, Matt Hancock, warning that the country was at a \u201cperilous moment\u201d. Many parts of northern England, Wales and Scotland have introduced tougher restrictions on social interaction to try to curb the growing spread of the disease. Here\u2019s some more detail on the Spanish government\u2019s declaration of a state of emergency to keep Madrid in partial lockdown. Salvador Illa, the national health minister, said the measures would remain in place for a fortnight, and also pointed out that other European cities had taken similar, or more drastic, action, despite having far low infection rates. \u201cThe president of Madrid has decided to do nothing,\u201d said Illa. \u201cOver the past week, 63 people have died from Covid-19 in the Madrid region. Right now, there are 3,361 people in hospital in the Madrid region. There are 498 people fighting for their lives in the region\u2019s intensive care units. We can sit on our hands or we can stop down the virus. Politics is about serving people and stopping the virus.\u201d The limited lockdown ordered by the government a week ago bans all non-essential movement in and out of the confined areas, but allows people to travel to work or to seek medical treatment. Bars and restaurants \u2013 whose capacity has been limited to 50% \u2013 must close by 11pm. Over the past two weeks, Madrid has registered 563.8 new cases per 100,000 people, compared with a national average of 256.8. Ayuso\u2019s government had reluctantly obeyed the order, but launched a successful legal challenge, arguing that its own actions were bringing the situation under control and that the central government had no right to step in. Ayuso is urging people in Madrid to stay in the city over the bank holiday weekend, but her administration has refused to heed the government\u2019s calls for tougher action, instead proposing a last-minute plan to confine 51 areas where there have been more than 750 new cases per 100,000 people. The regional health minister of Madrid, Enrique Ruiz Escudero, described the state of emergency as \u201can unjustified attack on the people of Madrid\u201d. By Thursday, Spain had logged a total 848,324 Covid cases \u2013 a rise of 12,243 on the previous day. The Madrid region accounts for a third of all Spain\u2019s cases and a similar proportion of the country\u2019s 32,688 deaths. Coronavirus border closures and restrictions have stranded nearly 3 million migrants around the world who want to return home but cannot, the UN migration agency has said, adding some had been \u201cwarehoused\u201d in unhygienic settings. The International Organisation for Migration report includes only migrants who want to return but are unable to do so because of Covid-19 restrictions \u2013 such as seafarers stuck on decommissioned ships, miners or construction workers. \u201cIt should be clear that migrants can be returned home in a safe and dignified manner despite the constraints imposed by Covid-19,\u201d said Director General, Ant\u00f3nio Vitorino in a statement, urging dialogue between countries. Some stranded migrants have been confined in unclean quarters and where social distancing was impossible, placing them at risk of disease. Others face abuse, exploitation and neglect, the report said. The worst region by far is the Middle East and North Africa, which accounts for 1.275 million of the total of 2.75 million in the IOM tally. Second was Asia with nearly a million. IOM spokesman Paul Dillon said 648,000 stranded migrants were in the United Arab Emirates and were often construction labourers from East Africa and Asia, while 280,000 were stuck in Saudi Arabia. Others are stuck onboard idle cruise ships, often not even granted the opportunity to go above deck. Chancellor Angela Merkel and mayors from Germany\u2019s 11 largest cities have agreed to adopt stricter anti-coronavirus measures if infections exceed a threshold of 50 cases per 100,000 a week. Measures could include tighter rules on mask-wearing, as well as restrictions on private gatherings and buying alcohol, Merkel said on Friday, adding that her top priority was to avoid shutting down society and the economy as in the spring lockdown. Merkel said she would meet with mayors again in two weeks to review whether the measures had been effective, adding: \u201cWe have proven that we can stand together against the virus and we should do that again.\u201d Non-emergency patients will not be admitted to hospitals in Iran due to large numbers of coronavirus patients. It is unclear if the directive, announced by deputy health minister Iraj Harirchi on Friday, applies to the whole country or just the capital, Tehran. The daily Covid-19 death toll reached a record of 239 this week in what the ministry says is a third wave of infections. \u201cDue to the large number of coronavirus outpatients and patients, hospitalization of non-emergency patients is not allowed until further notice,\u201d Harirchi was quoted as saying by Iranian media. Schools, mosques, shops, restaurants and other public institutions in Tehran closed for a week on 3 October and the governor extended the closure on Friday for another week. Masks, which had been compulsory in shops, must be worn anywhere in public from Saturday. Iran has recorded the most infections in the Middle East. More hospitals will be opened in Ukraine to treat coronavirus patients amid a recent spike in new cases, the government said on Friday. Ukraine registered a record 5,804 Covid-19 cases in the past 24 hours, the national security council said on Friday, up from a previous record of 5,397 new cases reported on Thursday. The government said in a statement that prime minister Denys Smygal had ordered health minister Maksym Stepanov to start preparation for expanding the number of hospitals for coronavirus cases because more than 20,000 out of 31,927 beds had been occupied already in the country. The minister said at least 900 patients with confirmed coronavirus infections were admitted to hospitals daily, and in some regions medical capacity was full completely. The daily tally in Ukraine climbed to a record level for the third day in a row, bringing the total number of cases of coronavirus infection to 250,538 with 4,779 deaths, including 89 in the past 24 hours. A total number of patients who have recovered since the start of the pandemic stood at 110,650. The government is also mulling ways to toughen lockdown measures, which have been gradually eased since June to help the economy that plunged 11.4% in the second quarter. Bereaved relatives of Italy\u2019s coronavirus victims are preparing to submit a further 150 legal complaints to prosecutors investigating alleged errors by authorities at the beginning of the pandemic. Action by Noi Denunceremo (We Will Report), a relatives\u2019 committee established in April, has been gathering pace in recent months, with a report alleging Italy\u2019s severely outdated pandemic plan may have contributed to thousands of deaths also being submitted to prosecutors in Bergamo. Italian authorities allegedly failed to update the country\u2019s pandemic plan in 2017, when the World Health Organization (WHO) and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) established new guidelines. The group has branded recent praise of Italy\u2019s subsequent handling of the pandemic as \u201cfake news\u201d. \u201cAfter over 36,000 official deaths and thousands more at home or in care homes, who were not tested as the hospitals exploded, not only have we not seen any institutional representative step aside, but both the prime minister and president of the Lombardy region have started regional, national and international media campaigns which would enhance their deeds in recent months,\u201d said the committee\u2019s president, Luca Fusco. The new complaints will be filed to prosecutors on Thursday, bringing the total submitted so far to 300. Conte was questioned by prosecutors in June. He said during an interview with the Guardian and five other European newspapers on Tuesday: \u201cWe are living in a situation that was unthinkable for all of us. Some accuse me of having done too much, of being a liberticide, while others accuse me of having done too little. I\u2019m aware that before responding to public opinion or a judicial authority, I should respond to my conscience. And I say this humbly: I think I did everything possible to manage a really difficult situation.\u201d Italy is scrambling to contain a new rise in coronavirus infections, with daily cases hitting 4,458 on Thursday \u2013 the highest since mid-April. Spain\u2019s government invoked a state of emergency on Friday to impose a partial lockdown on Madrid, one of Europe\u2019s worst Covid-19 hotspots, after a court had struck down the measures. The move escalates a standoff between prime minister Pedro Sanchez\u2019s socialist government and the conservative Madrid regional chief, who believes the curbs are illegal, excessive and disastrous for the local economy. Following a health ministry order, Madrid authorities last week reluctantly barred all non-essential travel in and out of the city and other nearby towns. The region had 723 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people in the two weeks to 8 October, according to the World Health Organization, making it Europe\u2019s second densest cluster after Andorra. But instead of a blanket restriction, the Madrid region chief Isabel Diaz Ayuso wants tailored restrictions in different neighbourhoods according to local contagion levels. A Madrid court sided with her on Thursday, effectively suspending the restrictions and prompting the government\u2019s response with an emergency order. Oman will reintroduce a night-time ban on movement and enforce the overnight closure of shops and public places between 11 and 24 October, to help contain the spread of coronavirus. The restrictions will apply from 8pm to 5am. The Gulf state\u2019s beaches will also be closed until further notice, state media said, reporting a decision from the supreme council in charge of coronavirus policy. Daily new case numbers have been rising since the end of August, following a fall since July. Oman has recorded 104,129 cases of Covid-19 infection and 1,009 deaths so far. Oman, a country of 4.7 million people, lifted a night curfew in mid-August and resumed international flights on 1 October. It had previously also enforced a ban on movement between provinces. Authorities will also close down some enterprises which had previously re-opened and are not adhering to coronavirus prevention measures, the announcement said. Poland reported a record daily rise in coronavirus cases for the fourth consecutive day on Friday, with 4,739 reported new infections. From Saturday, wearing masks outside will be compulsory across the country, and a tightening of measures in schools is also expected to be announced. Switzerland has reported a record daily rise in coronavirus infections of 1,487. The country\u2019s health agency has reported a total of 60,368 confirmed cases, up from 58,881 on Thursday. The death toll rose by three to 1,794. Switzerland reported its first confirmed case of Covid-19 in late February. New daily infections previously peaked at 1,456 on 23 March but had dwindled to as few as three on 1 June. More than 36.5 million people have been reported to have been infected by Covid-19, and 1,060,997 have died, according to an updated Reuters tally. Infections have been reported in more than 210 countries and territories since the first cases were identified in China in December 2019. Germany has recorded more than 4,000 new infections for the second day in a row, with the country\u2019s disease control agency stating on Friday it has been notified of 4,516 confirmed cases in the last 24 hours. The latest daily coronavirus numbers are the highest recorded in Germany since 16 April, when testing capacity was considerably lower. The infection fatality rate in Germany for now remains relatively low, at 3% compared with 4.7% in June. Berlin has emerged as one of the hotspots of the pandemic\u2019s second wave, with the capital on Thursday crossing the crucial threshold of more than 50 cases per 100,000 people over the last seven days. \u201cThese developments cause me great concern\u201d, Berlin\u2019s mayor, Michael M\u00fcller, said on Thursday evening. Bars, restaurants and off-licences in the capital will from Saturday be forced to close between 11pm and 6am, and rules around public and private gatherings at nighttime will be further tightened. \u201cWe cannot rule out having to agree to take further steps\u201d, M\u00fcller said. \u201cWe want to do everything to avoid a lockdown like the one we\u2019ve already had.\u201d Russia is expected to register a second potential Covid-19 vaccine on 15 October, Reuters is reporting. The vaccine has been developed by the Vector Virology Institute and Biotechnology Center, a former Soviet bioweapons research laboratory. Russia\u2019s rapid vaccine-development campaign highlights president Vladimir Putin\u2019s goal to establish the country as a primary player in the global race to secure Covid-19 vaccines. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week that Russia\u2019s Ministry of Health had declined to say what the approval would be for. But, said the paper, the country\u2019s first vaccine, called Sputnik V, received conditional emergency approval in early August, after being tested on only 76 subjects, with the requirement that it would subsequently undergo large-scale trials.

Find out where the virus has spread, and where it has been most deadly. Coronavirus map of the UK Coronavirus map of the US Coronavirus cases in Australia Telstra denies Victoria police requested Graham Ashton\u2019s phone records for hotel quarantine inquiry. Phone records of former police chief considered crucial in investigation to determine who made the decision to use private security guards. Victoria police never formally requested Telstra provide ex-police chief Graham Ashton\u2019s phone records to help the hotel quarantine inquiry uncover who made the decision to use private security guards in the botched program, Guardian Australia can reveal. On Wednesday, a spokesperson for Victoria police told Guardian Australia that police \u201cdid contact Telstra and request incoming call data for the former chief commissioner\u2019s phone\u201d. Telstra on Friday, however, disputed the police\u2019s account and denied such requests were made. \u201cI can confirm that we did not receive any formal requests for information,\u201d a Telstra spokesperson told Guardian Australia. A Victoria police spokeswoman said police had \u201ccooperated fully and transparently with the inquiry\u201d. \u201cAs it remains underway it would not be appropriate for us to comment further at this time.\u201d Authorities in Moscow were considering closing bars and nightclubs to halt a second coronavirus wave as the number of new daily cases surged on Friday to the highest it has been since the pandemic began. Russia reported 12,126 new infections, Reuters has said, pushing the overall total to 1,272,238. The previous record daily rise was 11,656 cases on May 11, when strict lockdown measures were in force across most of the vast country. Russian authorities have recommended people stay at home this weekend, but currently have no lockdown in place and the Kremlin has said there are no plans to impose one for now. The Moscow Mayor\u2019s office was looking into closing bars, nightclubs and karaoke bars, but keeping restaurants in the capital open, the RBC media outlet reported on Friday, citing a a source at the mayor\u2019s office. \u201cWe have to at least somehow reduce the number of people in the city, otherwise we may arrive at the same strict restrictions as we had in the spring,\u201d RBC quoted the source as saying. Authorities in Moscow, the epicentre of Russia\u2019s coronavirus outbreak in the spring, has also recommended people over the age of 65 isolate and has told businesses that at least a third of their staff must work remotely. Officials said on Friday that 201 people had died of COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, in the last 24 hours, pushing the official death toll to 22,257. Philippines confirms 2,996 new coronavirus cases, 83 more deaths The Philippines\u2019 health ministry on Friday reported 2,996 new coronavirus infections and 83 deaths, Reuters is reporting. In a bulletin, the ministry said total confirmed cases in the Philippines have increased to 334,770, the highest toll in Southeast Asia, and fatalities to 6,152. How does Trump\u2019s Covid care compare with the average 74-year-old\u2019s? The president\u2019s experience with coronavirus has been very different from the ordinary American senior, but Trump has ignored the disparities. From getting a helicopter ride to a military hospital with a specialised suite to receiving experimental drugs made available to fewer than 10 people, Donald Trump\u2019s experience with Covid-19 has been very different from that of your average 74-year-old American with a serious illness. The president ignored these disparities after returning to the hospital on Monday night and in a video from the White House Trump said of Covid-19: \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of it.\u201d Here\u2019s a look at how different the experience of catching Covid-19 is for the most powerful 74-year-old in the US compared with most of his fellow citizens. NSW and Sydney Covid trend map: where coronavirus cases are rising or falling Guardian Australia analysis and map shows how the pattern of Covid-19 has changed by region and throughout Sydney. Live data updates will track the numbers throughout New South Wales NSW Covid-19 hotspots list Full Australian stats interactive; Vic cases trend map Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s coronavirus email Spanish prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez is holding an emergency cabinet meeting this morning to consider declaring a state of emergency for Madrid and its surrounding region, to impose stronger anti-virus restrictions on the reluctant regional governors. AP are reporting that the meeting comes a day after a Madrid court struck down a national government order that imposed a partial lockdown in the Spanish capital and its suburbs. The ruling sided with regional officials who had appealed the application of stricter measures against one of Europe\u2019s most worrying virus clusters. The judges said that travel restrictions in and out of the cities might be necessary to fight the spread of the coronavirus, but that under the current legal framework they were violating residents\u2019 \u201cfundamental rights\u201d. A state of emergency gives the national government extraordinary powers in time of crises to temporarily limit the constitutional rights of citizens. In this case, it would limit their freedom of movement by restarting perimeter controls on Madrid and some nearby towns also suffering from high contagion rates. A much stricter nationwide state of emergency that began with home confinements was applied by the government from March until June to successfully rein in Spain\u2019s first wave of the virus that causes Covid-19. Since it ended, the regions have regained control of health policy and their responses to controlling outbreaks has varied. Some have applied perimeter lockdowns around areas or towns with viral clusters. The Madrid region has a 14-day infection rate of 591 coronavirus cases per 100,000 residents, more than twice Spain\u2019s national average of 257 and five times the European average rate of 113 for the week ending 27 September.

Two doctors involved in the trial of the drug told Reuters that more patients are asking to participate in the drug\u2019s trials, though medical experts have pointed out the drug, REGN-COV2, is still too early in its trial period to confirm that it can help treat Covid-19. On Wednesday, hours after Trump praised the drug as the \u201ccure\u201d for the virus, Regeneron announced it submitted an application to the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) for an emergency use authorization of the drug, which is a cocktail mix of two antibodies meant to aid the immune system in fighting the virus. The winner of this year\u2019s Nobel peace prize will be announced on Friday at 11am (0900 GMT) in Oslo, with no shortage of causes or candidates on this year\u2019s list. While the Norwegian Nobel committee maintains absolute secrecy about whom it favours for arguably the world\u2019s most prestigious prize, that has never stopped speculation ahead of the announcement. Guesses \u2013 and bets \u2013 this year have focused on the Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, the Russian dissident Alexei Navalny, recovering from a nerve agent attack he blames on Russian president Vladimir Putin, and the World Health Organization for its role in addressing the coronavirus pandemic. Coronavirus cases in Bulgaria have hit new daily high record, Reuters is reporting. The country has reported 516 new coronavirus cases of coronavirus \u2013 the third day in a row it has beaten its own record since the start of the pandemic in March, official data showed. The Balkan country has 23,279 Covid-19 cases, including 880 deaths. A total of 1,063 people are hospitalised and 56 are in intensive care, data from the coronavirus information platform showed. Despite the surge in infections in past days, the health minister said the country was still doing relatively well compared with other European Union countries hit by a second Covid-19 wave and ruled out imposing new restrictions for now. As we reported earlier: Reuters is confirming that China has joined a global vaccine initiative for distributing 2bn doses of Covid-19 vaccines around the world by the end of next year. The Covax vaccine facility supports equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines to rich and poor countries alike. The Gavi vaccine alliance has confirmed that China has become the 170th country to join, becoming the largest economy to join the group. \u201cThis is fantastic news, which gives even more momentum to our efforts to ensure global, equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines,\u201d said Seth Berkley, the chief executive of Gavi. The move means China \u201cwill be procuring vaccines through the facility for a proportion of their own population, just as with other countries that have joined\u201d, a spokesman said. Earlier, China\u2019s foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said: \u201cThis is an important step China has taken to uphold the concept of a shared community of health for all and to honour its commitment to turn #Covid19 vaccines into a global public good.\u201d Victoria and Melbourne Covid trend map: where coronavirus cases are rising or falling Guardian Australia analysis and map shows how the pattern of Covid-19 has changed by region and throughout Melbourne.

Friday briefing: England should pull circuit breaker \u2013 experts Scientists advising the government have warned that further Covid restrictions do not go far enough and \u201cfringe\u201d anti-lockdown epidemiologists are gaining too much attention. The shutdown of pubs and restaurants in the north and Midlands expected next week is unlikely to bring cases down sufficiently, members of the Sage committee have told the Guardian, and the \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d imposed in Scotland from today should have been enacted in England two or three weeks ago. The Guardian understands most of northern England \u2013 from Barrow in Cumbria to Merseyside, Greater Manchester, much of Lancashire and Yorkshire and most of the north-east, as well as Nottinghamshire in the Midlands \u2013 will be put under a new three-tier alert system. It will be announced on Monday to come into force on Wednesday, a government source has said: Keir Starmer has called for an end to the government\u2019s \u201cserial incompetence\u201d throughout the pandemic as concerns grow over the possibility of further restrictions being introduced, PA Media reports. The Labour opposition leader, writing in the Telegraph, decried the leaking of plans for tougher measures and said it had led to confusion about Downing Street\u2019s approach. He suggested a number of ways the government could \u201cget a grip of this situation urgently before it spirals out of control\u201d. Local leaders had to be consulted more closely over restrictions, he said, to arrest frustration amid a sense that No 10 was talking down to parts of the country: Donald Trump, who is still recovering from Covid-19, suggested he might organise a rally in Florida on Saturday, while continuing to ignore questions on whether he has yet tested negative for the disease. On Thursday night, Trump said: \u201cI think I\u2019m going to try doing a rally on Saturday night if we can, if we have enough time to put it together. \u201cBut we want to do a rally in Florida, probably in Florida on Saturday night, might come back and do one in Pennsylvania, on the following night.\u201d The United States passed 7.6m cases. The US will likely have more than 8m cases by Thursday next week, when Biden hosts a Town Hall in place of the virtual debate Trump refused to agree to. The US case total accounts for just over a fifth of the global case total. The US death toll, at more than 212,000, accounts for over one in five deaths worldwide, too. House speaker Nancy Pelosi, announced on Thursday that Democrats in the US Congress would meet to discuss the 25th amendment to the constitution, which contains a clause that allows a president to be removed from office against his will because of physical or mental incapacity. Trump\u2019s physician, Dr Sean Conley, said he anticipated Trump would be able to return to public engagements on Saturday, after initially suggesting that the president might not be able to return to public life until Monday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that Covid-19 patients can be around others 10 days after their symptoms first appear, provided they have not had a fever in the preceding 24 hours. It emerged that White House chief of staff Mark Meadows held a 70-person indoor wedding for his daughter in Atlanta in May in defiance of state and municipal guidelines, the New York Times reported. Wisconsin opened a field hospital amid a surge in cases that has overwhelmed the state\u2019s health care system. Governor Tony Evers said in a statement, \u201cWe\u2019re in a crisis right now and need to immediately change our behaviour to save lives.\u201d In non-US news: China has officially joined a global vaccine initiative for distributing 2bn doses of Covid-19 vaccines around the world by the end of next year, according to the ministry of foreign affairs. Foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Friday that Beijing had joined the initiative known as Covax, making China the largest economy to join to coalition aimed at countering so-called \u201cvaccine nationalism\u201d. Cuba to open for tourism starting next week. Prime Minister Manuel Marrero said late on Thursday that most of the Caribbean island nation would open to international tourism starting next week as it moved towards a \u201cnew normality\u201d after containing its coronavirus outbreak. India nears 7m cases. India\u2019s total coronavirus cases rose by 70,496 in the last 24 hours to 6.91 million on Friday morning, data from the health ministry showed. Deaths from Covid-19 infections rose by 964 to 106,490, the ministry said. India\u2019s death toll from the novel coronavirus rose past 100,000 on Saturday, only the third country in the world to reach that bleak milestone, after the United States and Brazil, and its epidemic shows no sign of abating. Australia reported its second straight day without any Covid-19 deaths on Friday, the longest stretch without any fatalities from the virus in three months. Australian states and territories reported 16 cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, down from 28 on Thursday, and no deaths for two days, the first time Australia has gone 48 hours without a Covid-19 death since July 11. The results cement optimism that Australia has contained a second wave of Covid-19 infections. Romania suspends flights to and from high-risk countries to stem a sharp rise in new coronavirus infections. Travellers from 49 high-risk countries will need to self-isolate for 10-14 days upon arrival, except those travelling for less than three days, who must have a negative coronavirus test. On Thursday, the government suspended flights from the countries on the list, except European Union states, the UK, the UAE and Qatar. Madrid must impose travel restrictions or face state of emergency, Spanish government says. Madrid must enforce travel restrictions ordered by the health ministry to limit coronavirus outbreaks or the national government will impose a state of emergency that would force it to comply, the Spanish government said late on Thursday. Paris hospitals move into emergency mode amid rise in Covid-19 patients. Hospitals in the Paris region have moved into emergency mode, cancelling staff holidays and postponing non-essential operations, as coronavirus patients made up close to half of all patients in intensive care units (ICUs). China has officially joined a global vaccine initiative for distributing 2bn doses of Covid-19 vaccines around the world by the end of next year, according to the ministry of foreign affairs. Foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Friday that Beijing had joined the initiative known as Covax, making China the largest economy to join to coalition aimed at countering so-called \u201cvaccine nationalism\u201d. \u201cThis is an important step China has taken to uphold the concept of a shared community of health for all and to honour its commitment to turn #Covid19 vaccines into a global public good,\u201d Hua wrote on Twitter. Beijing had initially missed the deadline for joining the Covax initiative co-led by the World Health Organization (WHO), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovations. The goal of the alliance of 156 countries is to provide Covid-19 vaccines to a targeted 3% of each participating country\u2019s most at-risk population by sharing the costs of research and distribution among both developed and developing countries: A second CDC epidemiologist has joined the White House\u2019s contact tracting team, the Washington Post reports: A week after a cluster of coronavirus cases emerged following a White House event, the Trump administration is now working on a limited basis with the federal government\u2019s elite cadre of disease detectives to control further spread. Two epidemiologists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are assisting the White House in tracking down people who may have been exposed to the coronavirus, CDC spokesman Jason McDonald said Thursday. One epidemiologist has been detailed to the White House since March and the second arrived recently. CBS reporter Sara Cook says that the White House claims, however, that enlisting the help of a second epidemiologist has \u201cnothing to do\u201d with what has happened in the last two weeks: If you need a laugh at the end of an extremely depressing week: Podcast: Will Trump\u2019s handling of Covid-19 be his undoing? Politics Weekly Extra After a week in which so much happened in the US, Jonathan Freedland talks to the Guardian US columnist Moira Donegan about why the pandemic might be the one issue Trump can\u2019t talk his way out of, and to Lauren Gambino about what swing states tell us about modern US politics: Here is our full story on Trump saying he hopes to hold a rally on Saturday: Donald Trump, who is still recovering from Covid-19, has suggested he might organize a rally in Florida on Saturday, while continuing to ignore questions on whether he has yet tested negative for the disease. On Thursday night, Trump said: \u201cI think I\u2019m going to try doing a rally on Saturday night if we can, if we have enough time to put it together. \u201cBut we want to do a rally in Florida, probably in Florida on Saturday night, might come back and do one in Pennsylvania, on the following night.\u201d At least one Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, has been linked by a local health official to a spike in coronavirus cases. Most supporters at recent Trump events have eschewed masks and social distancing measures to slow the spread of disease. Asked by Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity on Thursday night whether he had yet to test negative for coronavirus \u2013 or whether he had been tested at all since his positive test last week \u2013 the president did not directly respond, instead touting the experimental drugs he had been treated with. He said he would be likely be tested on Friday. Australia reported its second straight day without any Covid-19 deaths on Friday, the longest stretch without any fatalities from the virus in three months. Australian states and territories reported 16 cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, down from 28 on Thursday, and no deaths for two days, the first time Australia has gone 48 hours without a Covid-19 death since July 11. The results cement optimism that Australia has contained a second wave of Covid-19 infections. The country\u2019s second most populous state Victoria, the epicentre of Australia\u2019s Covid-19 outbreak, said they now have less than 200 active infections. \u201cThese are the results that come from a really determined effort to defeat this second wave,\u201d Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews told reporters in Melbourne. Australia has reported more than 27,000 coronavirus infections and about 900 deaths - far fewer than many other developed countries. India\u2019s total coronavirus cases rose by 70,496 in the last 24 hours to 6.91 million on Friday morning, data from the health ministry showed. Deaths from Covid-19 infections rose by 964 to 106,490, the ministry said. India\u2019s death toll from the novel coronavirus rose past 100,000 on Saturday, only the third country in the world to reach that bleak milestone, after the United States and Brazil, and its epidemic shows no sign of abating. Here is Kamala Harris\u2019 uncle on his niece\u2019s debate performance: US Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s debate with Democrat Kamala Harris attracted 57.9 million TV viewers, Reuters reports, the second-highest audience ever for a matchup between vice presidential candidates, according to Nielsen data released on Thursday. The viewership figure for the Wednesday evening faceoff in Salt Lake City included people watching across 18 networks. The tally came in 56% higher than four years ago, when 37 million people tuned in to see Pence debate Democrat Tim Kaine. During the policy-heavy 90-minute event, Pence and Harris clashed over the Trump administration\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Vice presidential debates typically draw smaller audiences than presidential clashes. President Donald Trump\u2019s Sept. 29 debate with Democratic challenger Joe Biden pulled in 73 million viewers, making it the second-biggest event on U.S. television this year, after the Super Bowl. The TV viewing record for a vice presidential debate was set in 2008, when Biden debated Republican Sarah Palin. That telecast drew 69.9 million viewers. For the Pence-Harris matchup, Fox News Channel led all networks, with 11.9 million viewers. The Nielsen numbers included people watching at home and at such venues as bars and restaurants. It also included some digital viewership through televisions connected to the internet. The figures do not capture the full extent of online viewing, which has grown in popularity as traditional TV audiences decline, however. The debate was streamed live on Twitter, YouTube, network websites and other digital platforms. In Cuba meanwhile: Prime Minister Manuel Marrero said late on Thursday that most of the Caribbean island nation would open to international tourism starting next week as it moved towards a \u201cnew normality\u201d after containing its coronavirus outbreak. From Reuters: The country, which closed its borders six months ago in a bid to contain the spread of the virus, has been gradually opening up to tourism ahead of the November-March high season, first in the northern keys and then its Varadero beach resort. Thirteen of Cuba\u2019s sixteen provinces will now be open to tourism, Marrero told a roundtable discussion broadcast to the nation, albeit not yet the capital, Havana which only just appears to have curbed a second wave of infections with strict measures, including a curfew. International tourism is one of Cuba\u2019s top hard currency earners, so its suspension this year has dealt a blow to the cash-strapped economy, even as the United States has continued to harden its decades-old trade embargo. \u201cWe will open the possibility of international flights for all the provinces that are in this third phase,\u201d Marrero said, noting that all arrivals would be tested. Cuba\u2019s universal, community-based healthcare system has contained its outbreak and reduced mortality by hospitalising all confirmed cases, tracing and isolating their contacts and applying a raft of therapeutic treatments. Cuba has reported just 11 deaths from Covid-19 per million inhabitants, compared with 203 for the Dominican Republic and 647 for the United States, statistics from Johns Hopkins University show. On the debate, from the Washington Post: Trump\u2019s advisers have told him how valuable the debates are, citing viewership that far exceeds his typical rallies. Some aides have struggled to get Trump to understand that a debate, which is likely to draw more than 60 million viewers, is far more impactful than a rally that airs exclusively to a Fox News audience of less than 4 million, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly. The United States has passed another pandemic milestone, with more than 7.6m cases now registered on the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The US will likely have more than 8m cases by Thursday next week, when Biden hosts a Town Hall in place of the virtual debate Trump refused to agree to. The US case total accounts for just over a fifth of the global case total. The US death toll, at more than 212,000, accounts for over one in five deaths worldwide, too. White House chief of staff Mark Meadows held a 70-person indoor wedding for his daughter in Atlanta in May in defiance of state and municipal guidelines, the New York Times reported earlier today. The wedding, the Times reports: Took place early in the coronavirus pandemic, as Americans were canceling or postponing their own weddings and other long-planned gatherings to comply with public health restrictions aimed at slowing the spread of the virus. Photographs from the May 31 event, posted online, show no masks or distancing among the crowd of several dozen tuxedo-clad attendees. The squeeze on Britain\u2019s beleaguered retail sector from tighter coronavirus restrictions reducing numbers of shoppers on the high street clung on into September, data showed Friday, AFP reports. Latest figures from industry body the British Retail Consortium and analytics company ShopperTrack showed that UK retail footfall was down by 30.1% in September compared with a year earlier. The data did show a slight month-on-month improvement in September from August - although local lockdown restrictions weighed on sentiment. Britain began emerging in June from a nationwide lockdown that lasted almost three months. The lockdown sparked a surge in online shopping as people shunned high streets and switched to computer screens and smartphones. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey meanwhile warned Thursday that recession-mired Britain faced the prospect of an \u201cuneven\u201d recovery, as the government battles a second wave of rising infections with tighter restrictions and localised lockdowns. \u201cWhen you look at areas of activity in the economy that require more close social interaction, it\u2019s no surprise that they have been the weakest to recover,\u201d he said at an online conference. Mexico\u2019s health ministry on Thursday reported 5,300 new confirmed cases of coronavirus infection and 370 additional fatalities, bringing the total in the country to 804,488 infections and 83,096 deaths. The government has said the real number of infected people is likely significantly higher than the confirmed cases. The US state of Wisconsin has opened a field hospital to meet an alarming rising demand for care as coronavirus cases surge and overwhelm hospitals, CNN reports. Governor Tony Evers said in a news conference earlier, \u201cWe obviously hoped this day wouldn\u2019t come, but unfortunately, Wisconsin is in a much different and more dire place today, and our health care systems are being overwhelmed.\u201d Evers said in a statement that the state \u201cis in crisis right now\u201d: From CNN: Only two US states report a decline of new cases and nationwide hospitalizations are increasing. The field hospital is a stark illustration of the extensive outbreak across Wisconsin, which has pushed hospitals to the brink, led to renewed limits on public gatherings, infected US Sen. Ron Johnson and forced the NFL\u2019s Green Bay Packers to put an \u201cindefinite hold\u201d on having fans at historic Lambeau Field this season. To combat the outbreak, Gov. Evers issued an emergency order limiting public gatherings to no more than 25% of a room or building\u2019s capacity. The state had previously allowed bars and restaurants to operate at 50% capacity. \u201cWe\u2019re in a crisis right now and need to immediately change our behaviour to save lives,\u201d Evers said in a statement. \u201cWe are continuing to experience a surge in cases and many of our hospitals are overwhelmed, and I believe limiting indoor public gatherings will help slow the spread of this virus.\u201dThe order, which went into effect Thursday morning, applies to any gatherings at locations open to the public, including stores, restaurants and other businesses with public entry, according to the release. Trump has told Hannity that \u201cthe vaccines are going to be coming really soon.\u201d He again repeats that the experimental treatment he received is a \u201ccure\u201d. There is no known cure for coronavirus. Trump claims that \u201cwe\u2019re going to get it to everybody free of charge. It\u2019s going to hospitals it\u2019s starting very soon. The military is going to be delivering it.\u201d A reminder that several high-level military officers are currently quarantining and at least two have tested positive for coronavirus. And that Trump does not have the power to make the treatment free without new legislation. And that he has ties to Leonard Schleifer, the CEO of Regeneron, which produces the experimental treatment Trump credits with \u201ccuring\u201d him. Trump\u2019s relationship Schleifer, whom he reportedly calls \u201cLenny\u201d, adds to growing questions over the president\u2019s almost exclusive access to experimental treatments unavailable to most other Americans, even as he has continued to downplay the threat of coronavirus based on his own experience. More from AP: The chair of the Commission on Presidential Debates says it is not reconsidering shifting the second debate from virtual back to in-person, despite a request from President Donald Trump\u2019s team. Frank Fahrenkopf told The Associated Press late Thursday that the nonpartisan group\u2019s decision was not going to be reversed. That means the second debate is probably not going to happen at all. The commission decided to make the Oct. 15 debate virtual after Trump tested positive for the coronavirus. Fahrenkopf says that the group wanted to \u201cprotect the health and safety of all involved\u201d and that the decision was guided by the advice of the Cleveland Clinic, its heath partner for the 2020 debates. Trump\u2019s doctor, Navy Cmdr. Sean Conley, said in a letter Thursday evening that Trump would be cleared to resume public activities Saturday, 10 days after his diagnosis. Earlier Thursday, Trump balked at the virtual event and said he wouldn\u2019t participate. Biden\u2019s campaign then said Biden would participate in a town hall hosted by ABC News on 15 October instead. The chair of the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates has told The Associated Press that the final debate, scheduled for 22 October, is still slated to go on with both candidates present as planned. But next Thursday\u2019s debate seemed to be gone, after the Trump team objected to the commission\u2019s format change. Trump had to stop speaking for a moment because he was hoarse: Trump has so far repeatedly avoided the question of whether he had been tested since he tested positive. Hannity: Have you been tested recently? Trump: Yeah I just saw the doctors today they think I\u2019m in great shape Hannity: Did you test negative? Trump: And I\u2019ll tell you I took this Regeneron and it\u2019s phenomenal. Here is the audio of Trump on Hannity. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to try doing a rally on Saturday night, if we have enough time to put it together,\u201d he says. Asked whether he\u2019s had a test since testing positive last week, Trump said, \u201cWell what we\u2019re doing is probably the test will be tomorrow. The actual test, because there\u2019s no reason to test all the time.\u201d So, if Trump is telling the truth (and this is a big if) it sounds like nobody is able to confirm whether Trump has tested negative for coronavirus because he has not been tested \u2013 rather than that he has tested positive, which would be bizarre. Trump has told Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity that he wants to hold a rally on Florida or Pennsylvania on Saturday and has \u201cconceded\u201d, CNN reports, that he has not been tested again for coronavirus. Democrats in the US Congress have announced a plan to create a commission to review whether Donald Trump is capable of carrying out his presidential duties or should face removal from office. The office of the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, announced a Friday press conference about the bill after she expressed concern that Trump, who is under treatment for coronavirus at the White House, is suffering a \u201cdisassociation from reality\u201d. The president has unleashed a barrage of erratic and self-contradictory tweets and declarations in recent days that have left staff scrambling and raised concerns over his stability. Pelosi, who is negotiating a Covid-19 economic stimulus plan, responded at her weekly press conference: \u201cThe plan isn\u2019t for the president to say that he\u2019s a perfect physical specimen. Specimen, maybe I can agree with that ... And young, he said he was young.\u201d Trump \u201cis, shall we say, in an altered state right now\u201d and \u201cthe disassociation from reality would be funny if it weren\u2019t so deadly,\u201d the 80-year-old speaker added while wearing a mask. Trump reacted angrily to Pelosi\u2019s manoeuvre, tweeting: \u201cCrazy Nancy is the one who should be under observation. They don\u2019t call her Crazy for nothing!\u201d Trump is \u201cimploring\u201d aides to allow him to resume campaign rallies, the New York Times reports. Watching the news coverage and angry at the state of the race, Mr. Trump has been imploring aides to let him resume campaign rallies as soon as this weekend, which now could be possible. He showed up again in the Oval Office on Thursday despite efforts to get him to remain in the residence until he was more fully recovered. ... Campaign officials point to the calendar and note that the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape with its sexually offensive banter that was seen as the end of his 2016 candidacy emerged on Oct. 7 that year, roughly the same point in the campaign as now. But something else happened that day that helped distract attention from the tape: the leak of emails stolen by Russia from Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman. US Senate Candidate for South Caroline, Democrat Jaime Harrison, has threatened to pull out of tomorrow\u2019s South Carolina senate debate if Lindsey Graham doesn\u2019t take another Coronavirus test. Graham has responded by saying that that Harrison is \u201cdemanding special treatment\u201d. Graham refuses to take the test, which FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Nate Silver argues could be due to \u201cpretty strong incentives for Republican senators not to get tested right now.\u201d The US is on the brink of 7.6m cases, with 7,599,566 currently confirmed on the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The number of Americans who have died in the pandemic so far is 212,651. But the president of that country said earlier on the Fox Business channel, \u201cWhat happens is, you get better. That\u2019s what happens: you get better.\u201d ABC reports: The NYPD is experiencing an increase in the number of officers calling out sick this month. New York City Police Commissioner Dermot Shea asked officers to wear face coverings and take other precautions in a videotaped message to the department that followed an unusually large number of sickouts in the last week. Thirty-six NYPD members called out sick with suspected coronavirus in the first six days of October, Shea said in a video sent to officers Wednesday. By comparison, about 42 uniformed and civilian members called out sick monthly in July, August and September. Trump will be calling into Sean Hannity\u2019s radio show in a few minutes\u2019 time. I\u2019ll bring you any coronavirus-related news from that. Questions, feedback, news? Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. US President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign manager Bill Stepien has just announced (and the president has retweeted this) that Trump will be holding a campaign rally on Thursday instead of debating Joe Biden, after Trump refused to agree to hold a virtual debate. The statement says that by the time of the debate (Thursday next week), \u201c Trump will have posted multiple negative tests\u201d which appears to be the closest statement yet to saying that Trump has not yet tested negative for coronavirus since testing positive: \u201cWe\u2019ll pass on this sad excuse to bail out Joe Biden and do a rally instead,\u201d writes Bill Stepien. Stepien also has coronavirus. The statement does not explicitly say that the rally will be in person, but it doesn\u2019t indicate that it won\u2019t be in person, either. The note about negative tests would seem to suggest that an in-person rally is being planned. In the statement Stepien refers to the Presidential Debate Commission as \u201cswamp creatures\u201d: One of the drugs taken by Donald Trump that he has touted as a potential \u201ccure\u201d for coronavirus was developed using human cells originally obtained from an elective abortion, a practice repeatedly denounced by the president and many of his supporters. The drug is a monoclonal antibody cocktail developed by Regeneron. The president received an 8-gram infusion under a \u201ccompassionate use\u201d exemption when he was hospitalized over the weekend after testing positive for Covid-19. There is no cure for Covid-19, and the drug is not approved. The stem cells used to develop the drug are known as HEK-293T cells, a line of cells used in laboratories. The cells were originally derived from an embryonic kidney after an elective abortion performed in the Netherlands in the 1970s: Hi, Helen Sullivan here. I\u2019ll be bringing you the latest in Trump/White House coronavirus news as well as global updates for the next few hours. Say Hi on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Meanwhile the US has reported more than 55,000 cases, according to the Covid Tracking Project, and 975 deaths. Johns Hopkins has not yet confirmed the cases for 8 October. The US reported more than 50,000 cases on 7 October, according to the Johns Hopkins tracker. Here is the Trump campaign statement, which says that given Dr Conley\u2019s medical clearance, there is \u201cno medical reason\u201d why the debate should not take place in-person on Thursday. A reminder that Conley has not indicated that Trump has tested negative for coronavirus, which is one medical reason he should not be out in public. CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins reports that the Trump campaign has for a third time today called for an in-person debate with Joe Biden. On Thursday morning, the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) said that the next presidential debate, due on 15 October, would be a virtual affair, with the candidates appearing remotely. Biden agreed to the new rules, but Trump did not. It was then announced that Biden would hold a Town Hall that night instead. Here is the Biden campaign statement from earlier: White House Physician Dr Sean Conley has released a statement saying that Trump has completed his treatment for coronavirus \u201cI fully anticipate the president\u2019s return to public engagements on Saturday,\u201d Conley wrote. Conley, who has not taken questions from journalists in three days about the US president\u2019s health, did not indicate whether Trump had tested negative for coronavirus or when the president\u2019s last negative test was since testing positive. This means the president is still likely to be positive \u2013 and therefore infectious. Donald Trump is expected to call into Sean Hannity\u2019s show on Fox Newson Thursday night, and guest host the Rush Limbaugh Show \u2013 a three-hour radio program, on Friday. Donald Trump added more turbulence on Thursday to the US presidential race by refusing to participate in the next presidential debate with Joe Biden after it was changed to a virtual event to guard against the spread of Covid-19, prompting both campaigns to propose postponing it a week. On Thursday morning, the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) said that the next presidential debate, due on 15 October, would be a virtual affair, with the candidates appearing remotely. \u201cIn order to protect the health and safety of all, the second presidential debate will take the form of a town meeting, in which the candidates would participate from separate remote locations,\u201d it said. But Trump, who was hospitalized for three days after disclosing last Friday that he had tested positive for the coronavirus, blasted the format change announced by the nonpartisan commission in charge of the debates and expressed concern that his microphone could be cut off at the event: CNN has fact checked Trumps\u2019 interview on the Fox Business channel on Thursday evening, in which they say he made at least 14 false claims. Among them was this one: Trump said of his coronavirus infection: \u2018You catch this thing. A lot of people caught it.\u2019 He added a bit later, \u2018What happens is, you get better. That\u2019s what happens: you get better.\u2019 More than 212,000 Americans did not get better: they died. Many are suffering long-term effects or permanent damage from the virus. If their results are confirmed, this person would be the fourth journalist to have tested positive for Covid-19 after being exposed to an outbreak at the White House. \u201cIn the immediate days ahead, we continue to insist that journalists who are not in the pool and do not have an enclosed workspace refrain from entering the indoor press areas of the White House,\u201d the White House correspondents association said. \u201cWe would also strongly encourage all journalists to continue avoiding working from the White House grounds entirely if possible.\u201d Yesterday, BuzzFeed News pulled a political correspondent White House press pool due to coronavirus risks. On that update from Dr Conley: Meanwhile Donald Trump Jr is holding a packed rally \u2013 and not wearing a mask, despite his exposure to people who have recently tested positive for the virus: White House physician Sean Conley says that US President Donald Trump \u201chas responded extremely well to treatment\u201d and that he will \u201creturn to public engagements\u201d on Saturday. Conley did not say whether Trump has tested negative. \u201cSaturday will be day 10 since Thursday\u2019s diagnosis...I fully anticipate the president\u2019s safe return to public engagements at that time.\u201d In an extraordinary step, the Washington, DC, Department of Health has released an open letter appealing to all White House staff and anyone who attended a September 26 event in the Rose Garden and inside the building to mark the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to the supreme court to seek medical advice and take a Covid-19 test. The letter indicates a lack of confidence in the White House medical team\u2019s own contact tracing efforts regarding an ongoing virus outbreak that has infected Donald Trump, multiple senior staff members and two US senators, among others, The Associated Press writes. Co-signed by nine other local health departments from neighboring jurisdictions in Maryland and Virginia, the letter flatly states a belief that contact tracing on the outbreak has been insufficient. It says the public appeal is based on, \u201cour preliminary understanding that there has been limited contact tracing performed to date, there may be other staff and residents at risk for exposure to Covid positive individuals.\u201d It asks all White House employees, anyone who attended the Sept. 26 event and anyone who may have been in contact with those people to \u201ccontact your local health department for further guidance/questions regarding your potential need to quarantine.\u201d The letter represents a rising level of concern and a clear shift in strategy by Mayor Muriel Bowser\u2019s government, which had previously remained publicly hands-off and said it trusted the White House\u2019s robust medical operation to handle its own contact tracing and follow-up. Hello and welcome to today\u2019s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic.

Romania suspends flights to and from high-risk countries to stem a sharp rise in new coronavirus infections. Travellers from 49 high-risk countries will need to self-isolate for 10-14 days upon arrival, except those travelling for less than three days, who must have a negative coronavirus test. On Thursday, the government suspended flights from the countries on the list, except European Union states, the UK, the UAE and Qatar. Madrid must impose travel restrictions or face state of emergency, Spanish government says. Madrid must enforce travel restrictions ordered by the health ministry to limit coronavirus outbreaks or the national government will impose a state of emergency that would force it to comply, the Spanish government said late on Thursday. Paris hospitals move into emergency mode amid rise in Covid-19 patients. Hospitals in the Paris region have moved into emergency mode, cancelling staff holidays and postponing non-essential operations, as coronavirus patients made up close to half of all patients in intensive care units (ICUs). Trump says he will not take part in virtual presidential debate. Donald Trump has refused to participate in next week\u2019s debate with Joe Biden after it was announced the event would be held virtually due to the president\u2019s coronavirus diagnosis. Medical journal condemns Trump\u2019s handling of pandemic.
