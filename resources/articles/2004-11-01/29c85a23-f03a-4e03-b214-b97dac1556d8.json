He was being lowered to a peregrine falcon's nest on a ledge below so he could mark the eggs with indelible ink to foil robbers. And his subsequent first ascent of that climb - which today, 55 years on, still stands as the best route on the crag - had as many thrills. His companions in their nailed boots could make no impression on scaling the initial wall. Harry had plimsolls. He was thrust into the lead and as his friends watched his rope like proverbial hawks, he reached a ledge from where he could bring them up on the rope - and so on via further stances to the top. Recently I revisited the crag and met two climbers who said they had just top-roped an \"extreme\" on a short adjacent buttress, lowering a rope from the top and taking it in turns to safeguard each other up. Climbers are rare on Lakeland rock these grey autumn days; climbing walls and sun-soaked Spanish limestone are typical lures. They must have noticed a look on my face at the mention of top-roping, because one then said that climbing walls were their usual habitat: \"We feel safe, and can enjoy the 'move'. Why risk death leading up a damp crag?\" When I suggested they lower their sights and do Sadgill Wall, they pointed out that it was only a severe tick in the guidebook and that, \"We'll leave that until we're older.\" Off they ran down the scree, glowing from the exercise. But with the exhilaration Harry and successive leaders who have sharp-ended this route felt afterwards? I doubt it. I hope they don't leave it too late."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
