Roberts found himself unemployed when Wimbledon refused to renew his contract at the end of last season and was consigned to training on his own. A week with Brighton was his first hope before Mark McGhee offered him the chance at his spiritual home in Bermondsey. It was a far cry from the days when Roberts, a Millwall youth product, commanded multi-million-pound fees on a tour of south London that took in Crystal Palace and then the Dons. \"I wasn't even allowed to train with anyone until Martin Hinshelwood asked me to go down for a week,\" said Roberts. \"There was never any mention of a contract but then Millwall called.\" Roberts, an uncompromising midfielder not afraid to get stuck in - as his confrontation with Paul Kitson showed early in the second half - has been one of the higher-profile victims of football's financial mess. The game may well be full of surprises, but it would be hard to imagine Roberts not remaining at Millwall this season. \"I started here and it's good to be back,\" Roberts added. \"I think there's an offer there and I want to stay.\" Millwall finally broke down Brighton's stubborn resistance when Darren Ward scored the first goal late in the second half from a Christophe Kinet corner. The Brighton defender Robbie Pethick was then sent off for elbowing Kinet off the ball and will be fined by the club for his actions. It was Brighton's fifth successive defeat, and they have scored only two goals in the process. Hinshelwood has got the team playing fine football but failure to manage a single effort on target highlights the team's shortcomings after two successive promotions. \"We haven't been outplayed by anyone but it takes time to get used to this level,\" said the Brighton captain Danny Cullip. \"Things will be different when we get players back.\" Man of the match: Steve Claridge (Millwall)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
