The body responsible for deciding what medication should be available on the NHS said abatacept, manufactured by Bristol-Myers Squibb under the brand name Orencia, was not cost-effective. The chief executive of the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society, Ailsa Bosworth, said that about 12,000 people with an aggressive form of the disease who did not respond to other treatments would be \"condemned to a life of pain and disability, which could be equally expensive to the NHS\". \"Denying patients the option of abatacept leaves some of them with the unacceptable choices of being put back on to treatments they have already failed on, palliative care, or taking large doses of steroids which have extremely unacceptable side-effects,\" she said. Bristol-Myers Squibb, submitted evidence showing that about 3,585 patients in the UK would be eligible for treatment with the drug. Nice said its independent advisory committee had taken into account views from patients and other groups. \"Having examined cost-effectiveness analyses on abatacept ... the committee concluded that abatacept could not be considered a cost-effective use of NHS resources,\" it said. The draft Nice guidance is now open to consultation, with final guidance expected at the end of the year. Richard Marsh, director of external affairs at Bristol-Myers Squibb, said Nice had accepted the clinical benefits of the drug."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
