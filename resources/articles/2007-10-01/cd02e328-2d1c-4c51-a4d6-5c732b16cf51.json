The Greensands consortium of infrastructure investors and pension funds is paying \u00a31.3bn for the seventh largest water and sewage company in England and Wales, as well as taking on \u00a32.8bn of debt. The consortium is made up of a fund advised by JP Morgan Asset Management, which will hold a 32% stake, Australia's Challenger Infrastructure fund, with 27%, and the merchant bank UBS, with 18%. The balance will be held by a series of Australian pension funds, Hermes, which is owned by the BT pension scheme, and infrastructure investor Paceweald. Paceweald is linked to Vincent Tchenguiz's Consensus Business Group, which in turn has an 18.5% stake in Challenger. Southern Water provides water to 2.3 million people and waste water services to 4.3 million customers across Kent, Sussex, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. Greensands is understood to have faced competition for the purchase from a group led by Goldman Sachs. The acquisition is the latest in a series of deals on UK infrastructure, including the \u00a38bn acquisition of Thames Water by the Australian bank Macquarie, the takeover of Scottish Power by Spain's Iberdrola, the acquisition of BAA, the owner of Heathrow, by the Spanish group Ferrovial, and the purchase of AWG, the owner of Anglian Water. RBS bought a controlling stake in Southern Water in 2003 but put the business up for sale this year. The UK bank, which is leading the consortium buying the Dutch bank ABN Amro, said recently that it was also considering its options in relation to its Angel Trains leasing business. Yesterday Phil Peters, a director of Challenger, said the consortium was delighted to have acquired the company, which he described as the UK water utility \"with the highest growth profile in the sector\". \"We have a high regard for [Southern Water's] management team and the significant operational improvements they have delivered over the past two years and we look forward to supporting them on the successful delivery on the \u00a31.6bn investment programme for the current regulatory period.\" UK infrastructure assets have become popular with pension funds because of their relatively low risks and strong, stable cash flows, advantages which have been highlighted by the recent global credit crunch. The crisis in world credit markets has cast a shadow over the financing of a number of big deals. However, Challenger's chief executive, Steve Bickerton, said yesterday that the consortium had not run into any problems from the crisis, which was sparked by worries over sub-prime mortgages in the US. \"At the quality end of the market there is still a huge amount of appetite,\" he said. Greensands made it clear it regards the purchase of Southern Water as a long-term move. \"The financial, strategic and customer service objectives of the investors will be achieved through a long-term investment horizon, with no specific investment exit contemplated,\" it said in a statement. \"Southern Water will remain an independent operating entity, while benefiting from the broad experience of Greensands.\" Mr Bickerton said yesterday that the consortium expected significant efficiency gains at Southern Water and refused to rule out job cuts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
