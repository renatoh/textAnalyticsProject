In an interview with Forbes magazine, Donald Trump\u2019s middle son at first said the family honored \u201ckind of a steadfast pact we made\u201d not to mix business interests with public ones. \u201cThere is kind of a clear separation of church and state that we maintain, and I am deadly serious about that exercise,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not talk about the government with him, and he does not talk about the business with us.\u201d But he went on to say that he would keep the president abreast of \u201cthe bottom line, profitability reports and stuff like that, but you know, that\u2019s about it\u201d. He said those reports would be \u201cprobably quarterly\u201d. \u201cMy father and I are very close,\u201d he added. \u201cI talk to him a lot. We\u2019re pretty inseparable.\u201d Since their father handed day-to-day management of the Trump Organization to his adult sons, Eric and Donald Jr, the family has insisted they do not discuss the business with president. Ethics attorneys of both parties and the nonpartisan Office of Government Ethics have called the arrangement a failure to prevent potential conflicts of interest \u2013 for instance, Trump hotels selling rooms to foreign diplomats. Eric Trump\u2019s statement alarmed ethics experts, including Lisa Gilbert, a director at the not-for-profit watchdog Public Citizen. \u201cIt confirms our worst assumptions about the lack of separation between his business and current office,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to reconcile quarterly updates from your son.\u201d Gilbert said there were signs that the Trump family was already profiting from the presidency, including increased business at his golf clubs. His south Florida club, Mar-a-Lago, doubled its entrance fee to $200,000 in January, and in February the first lady, Melania Trump, filed court documents arguing that the White House was an opportunity to develop \u201cmultimillion-dollar business relationships\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not a single thing,\u201d Gilbert said. \u201cTheir businesses are doing better because there is more cachet around them.\u201d The watchdog released a report this week analyzing the first two months of the Trump presidency. It concluded that Trump had broken several promises to \u201cisolate\u201d himself from the business, that his White House was \u201cclouded by corruption and conflicts\u201d, and that he had surrounded himself \u201cwith the same major donors and Wall Street executives he claimed he would fight if elected\u201d. A Washington DC wine bar sued Trump and his new hotel this month, alleging that his ownership provides an illegal competitive advantage. The president still holds direct ties to his businesses, DC liquor board documents show, as the sole beneficiary of a revocable trust. The White House and Department of Homeland Security have declined to answer questions about whether taxpayer dollars have profited the Trump family, for instance through Secret Service rental payments to Trump properties. \u201cEric Trump and his father the president are doing what we thought they would do all along,\u201d said Richard Painter, who served as chief ethics attorney for George W Bush. \u201cThis of course makes no difference for conflict of interest purposes because it is his ownership of the businesses that creates conflicts of interest, regardless of who manages them.\u201d Painter added that Trump\u2019s remarks show that \u201cthe businesses is an important concern for the president\u201d. Gilbert compared the arrangement to other possible conflicts in the White House. Trump has appointed his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as a senior adviser, despite anti-nepotism laws, and the president\u2019s daughter, Ivanka, has acquired a security clearance and an office in the White House, although she has no official role. In November, Trump denied that he had sought security clearances for his children. \u201cWe don\u2019t really have a mechanism to enforce the ethics rules,\u201d Gilbert said. \u201cIt\u2019s left us without a lot of ground to stand on.\u201d Like the president, Kushner and his wife have said they will separate themselves from their family businesses, but have only done so partially, if at all. Kushner retains parts of his billionaire family\u2019s real estate empire, White House documents show, and Ivanka Trump has so far failed to resign, as promised, from the family business, according to documents acquired by ProPublica. Possible conflicts have already arisen for both of the president\u2019s family confidantes: Kushner\u2019s family is negotiating a $400m deal with a Chinese firm connected to Beijing\u2019s leadership, and one of Ivanka Trump\u2019s brands was promoted, in violation of ethics rules, on national television by another of the president\u2019s advisers. In Dallas this month, Donald Jr told Republican fundraisers that he had \u201cbasically zero contact\u201d with his father. His brother, similarly, told Forbes that he tries to \u201cminimize fluff calls that you might otherwise have because I understand that time is a resource\u201d. But he also echoed an earlier boast about the family brand being \u201cthe hottest it has ever been\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re doing great in all of our assets,\u201d he said, before arguing that being the family in the White House also entailed \u201cgreat sacrifices\u201d for the business, especially \u201cwhen you limit an international business to only domestic properties, when you put hundreds of millions of dollars of cash into a campaign, when you run with very, very tight and strict rules and the things that we do every single day in terms of compliance. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he concluded. \u201cYou could look at it either way.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
