It sounds absurd. Premier League football may think itself immune to the pressures of the economy, but with Uefa president Michel Platini, among others, talking about the need to draw in the purse strings, it is a good time to start waking up to reality. In the past TV revenues have filled a super-duper pot of money at Premier League rights auctions, but in the current financial climate how secure are the TV companies themselves? Advertising revenue is down and the average householder is beginning to feel the pinch, so how long before subscriptions go down and TV companies stumble? Over lunch with the England lads last week, we debated the new proposals. Huge investment sums aside, some of us felt the most disturbing aspect was encouraging 11-year-old kids to leave home to chase a dream. The whole idea has more in common with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory than a sensible career plan - hoping for a golden ticket to a football megastar future. When I was 11 I never thought about a career in football, I just loved playing. Is it morally right to be pushing football careers to 11-year-olds? I still wince every time a parent comes up to me and says their kid, aged seven, is enrolled in an academy. That's just plain wrong. Football shouldn't be about kids becoming superstars, it should just be about having fun. There's something weirdly X Factor about it all, hundreds of hopefuls dreaming of making it through to the final. Who knows, with TV revenue helping to fund the academies, how long before they want a piece of the action and the public start voting kids off the show? Despite my reservations, I do think there is scope for the Premier League to consider regionalised academies - but only if the pupils there were independent of any one club. It is too much pressure for a young footballer to have a club shelling out \u00a325,000 a year for their education, and it just perpetuates the cycle of agents grabbing at them and individual clubs enjoying a monopoly of the best players. Instead, why not adopt a US-style draft system whereby on graduation, aged 16, each youngster is put up for selection to Premier League teams. If the investment by the Premier League clubs is focused on developing academies to produce world-class footballers rather than helping already dominant clubs to extend their control over the best young players, then every club will have a more even chance of success. That's the beauty of the NFL draft system, it allows a more competitive and less predictable outcome each season. As a result the league reinvents itself every few years and there isn't a single side dominating the league over the course of a decade, like we so often see in top-flight football here. The plans would be more friendly to the Football League, too, who could recruit any players not selected by Premier League clubs - after five years of elite training these youngsters would be the best leftovers in football, without any investment from the lower league. The whole system would need a strong ethical backbone. An emphasis on education - not just the national curriculum, but a football education including basic refereeing and sports-science qualifications that would give youngsters the foundation of a career in football even if they did not make it as superstar players. Pupils should include a quantity of girls and disabled footballers - why should elite facilities and coaching only be made available to able-bodied young men? The message that football is for everyone should be encouraged at every level. The system would relieve the FA of the financial burden of developing young talent; instead they could step away from the academy side of things and concentrate on supporting grassroots football and raising the profile of the game. In a climate of money-grabbing and 'me, me, me' attitudes, this structure would adopt a more holistic approach. There would be tangible benefits to a wider community than just the Premier League elite, and yet the incentives for investment by the clubs are clear: they would be able to choose from a crop of talented, matured youngsters, rather than having to take the gamble of trying to select the next top goalkeeper when the kid is aged 11. It is time for a change in attitude from football's top tier and this could be the start of it. Nuts over trophy A very big thank you to the Football Supporters' Federation for presenting me with a special award on the pitch last Sunday (below) for my Observer columns. One of the FSF ladies kindly said the gang at their headquarters read every word. Well I have their magazine sent to me and always read their articles, which help give me a fans' perspective on things. The trophy will go in my kitchen with the rest of the silverware, including last season's proud addition - the Nuts worst hairdo of the year award, for my Clark Kent impression.
