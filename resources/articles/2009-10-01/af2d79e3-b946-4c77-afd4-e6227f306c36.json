In The Spirit Of Diaghilev showcases four new works, each inspired by some aspect of the impresario's collaborative and innovative spirit. Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui and Javier De Frutos work with music used or commissioned by Diaghilev, Cherkaoui creating a new version of L'Apr\u00e8s Midi d'un Faune, with additional music by Nitin Sawhney and costumes by Hussein Chalayan, and De Frutos using Ravel's score La Valse to channel the flamboyant creativity of Jean Cocteau, one of the liveliest artists in Diaghilev's inner circle. Also in the programme is Wayne McGregor's Dyad 1909, working with artists and film-makers Jane and Louise Wilson, and Russell Maliphant's take on the drawings and paintings of the doomed genius Vaslav Nijinsky. Sadler's Wells, EC1, Tue to 17 Oct"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
