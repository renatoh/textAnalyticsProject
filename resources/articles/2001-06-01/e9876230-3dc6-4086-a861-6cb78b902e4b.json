We even know such extremely odd things as that the voluntary sector is the highest-reporting sector for three aspects of workplace stress - general stress, sexual harassment, and bullying. A lot has been said about industry's responsibility to recognise stressed staff, which might explain why a heavyweight conference, Taking the Stress out of Work, begins on July 4, the fourth national Stress Awareness Day takes place on November 7, and why the Mental Health Foundation says of its report Burnt Out or Burning Bright? that it was pleasantly surprised to find big business willing to talk about the subject. But the answer may not lie in raising \"corporate awareness\". The responsibility may lie with someone much closer to the situation. You. International stress guru Paul Wilson, from Sydney, was a burned-out manager at 32. But instead of investigating his stress, he did the exact opposite - he studied peace, and wrote The Little Book of Calm, Calm at Work and Calm for Life. He also created The Calm Centre, a workshop of expert international thought on the subject. The big question, he says, is not about convincing employers. \"All senior corporate managers accept that stress is a factor of the modern workplace - I've never met one who thought otherwise. But few can see that a relaxed employee is the most effective worker - because most managers think that being 'relaxed' at work is an indication of not working! \"It is naive to try and change the way corporations think - but we can change the way employees think. If we can convince staff that it is they who have to change, not just the employer, we will be able to remove most stress from the workplace.\" There is widespread support for the idea that it is the workers themselves can remove their own stress. Joanna Guttman, who wrote The Stress Workbook, observes that workloads are a major problem for the PA - the \"can you just do this?\" syndrome. She says that PAs are worried about saying \"no\". \"In recent work with them, an interesting point has come out - their main difficulties in saying 'no' are that they'll be seen as unhelpful or incompetent, that they think no one else can help, and even that it is 'their place to say yes'! \"Secretaries can avoid a lot of stress by getting their brains around their five options in this situation. First, they can say 'yes' and do it, which is happy for everyone. Second, they can say 'yes, if... ', which opens up negotiation about how something can be done, is successful more frequently than you'd expect. \"The third option is to say 'yes' and not do it, but this is clearly dodgy, and the fourth option, to say 'no' but do it anyway, is disastrous for your self-esteem. But the fifth option is to say 'no' and it will cause fewer problems, particularly if you say it pleasantly. However, you must say the word 'no' - anything else is taken as 'possibly', which becomes 'probably', which is then assumed to be 'yes'!\" Does this play a big part in PA stress? \"Bucketloads of it, mainly due to admin cutbacks and the 'bottom of the pile' syndrome - most stress is felt by those with little control over change, and secretaries certainly come into this bracket. And to judge by all their questions about how I made the break from secretary to trainer, lots of them want to jump ship over it!\" Probably the widest variety of stress-reduction help in one place is at stressbusting.co.uk, a website which is imaginative enough to offer both the conventional techniques and the bizarre - typically, the \"torrid sexual fantasy\" method. This idea, from the American therapist Craig Mardus, may have more to recommend it than at first appears. Stressed people assume they must achieve relaxation, and use drugs to do so, he says, arguing that it is better to turn the energy of stress into positive excitement. \"If you are worrying about a job interview, the worry is about going into the future and looking for trouble, though it probably won't even happen. That's a fantasy - so replace the fantasy with a better one. \"It's a tool that you can use to realise that you have a choice, and to put yourself back into control by replacing the worrying thought with an exciting thought, so as to make the switch from bad adrenaline to good adrenaline - and the perfect example of good adrenaline is sex.\" Disappointingly, the idea does not feature on the agenda for the forthcoming conference. \u0095 Stress Awareness Day: International Stress Management Association, Mental Health Foundation, Calm Centre, Stressbusting, The Stress Workbook, Sheldon Press, \u00a36.99"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
