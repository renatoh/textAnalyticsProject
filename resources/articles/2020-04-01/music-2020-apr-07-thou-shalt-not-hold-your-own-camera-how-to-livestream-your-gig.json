Instead, resembling a housebreaking busker, he awkwardly fluffed his way through Coldplay snippets at his home studio piano, making a pig\u2019s ear of Viva La Vida and stopping Bowie\u2019s Life on Mars? just as it got going. When 300,000 people are watching, attack your songs like the online stadium residency it is. Don\u2019t: Use Facebook By contrast, the following day Frank Turner bellowed out a full set of brilliant, barnstorming folk-punk from under his stairs, so bristling with arena power that, in a room of just four, one of the audience managed to break his promotional Iron Maiden zombie hand. You feel for the neighbours because only the \u201cmeet the cat\u201d segment didn\u2019t threaten to burst 12,000 AirBuds. The police weren\u2019t called, but Facebook eventually shut the stream down for \u201cviolating community standards\u201d. Wassamadder algorithm? Can\u2019t handle the rock? Do: Put on a show On Instagram, Christine and the Queens emoted her way around her studio to Mountains (we met), filmed from a squeaky bike and putting the \u201cart\u201d into \u201ckeeping two metres apart\u201d. Lizzo livestreamed 30 minutes of flute mantra over steaming crystals to help calm the world\u2019s chakras. And, like a Doncaster Joker guest-hosting The Tonight Show, Yungblud created his own talkshow complete with theme tune, live emo anthems, drinking games and a cookery segment making Hot Cheetos Pancakes With Sanitiser Drizzle. There\u2019s a wide-open shed of possibilities out there \u2013 grab it with both hands. Don\u2019t: Hold your own camera When Bono knocked out a half-baked tribute to frontline doctors from the corner of \u201cDublin\u201d most resembling the Bahamas, it came in such extreme close-up it was like watching U2 from a seat in his beard. At least fashion your heaps of emergency gold reserves into a makeshift tripod. Do: Have an enthusiastic spouse On one hand, Keith Urban self-isolated in a guitar warehouse as his wife Nicole Kidman danced around to his \u201ckaraoke\u201d canyon rock, the very picture of co-isolated bliss. On the other, when John Legend took up Chris Martin\u2019s #TogetherAtHome baton, everything was going great until his unimpressed wife \u2013 model Chrissy Teigen \u2013 walked in wearing a bath towel, sat on the keyboard saying \u201cyou wanna hear The Butt Song?\u201d, slow-clapped his most romantic tunes and started a row about having a third child. If they own an Iron Maiden zombie hand, it\u2019s not lasting a week. Don\u2019t: Let quality control slip Let\u2019s just say, if you\u2019ve kicked John Lennon\u2019s Imagine to a brutal, painful death by getting your friends to record individual lines from it in more keys than actually exist, best keep it for the WhatsApp group-chat. Do: Think big Willie Nelson seriously upped the game with \u2019Til Further Notice, which transformed his annual backyard festival Luck Reunion into a bedroom-based bonanza, featuring the likes of Jewel, Nathaniel Rateliff, Lucinda Williams and himself broadcasting from various outhouses and chicken shacks across the US. It was dubbed the Lockdown Woodstock (Woodlock?), and peaked with Paul Simon and Woody Harrelson covering the Everly Brothers. Elsewhere, Courtney Barnett, Waxahatchee and Sheryl Crow arranged a livestreamed festival within days \u2013 who says there can\u2019t be a bedroom Glastonbury? Don\u2019t: Give up now We\u2019re in this for the long haul, so one wonky cover of (Something Inside) So Strong won\u2019t earn you our eternal emojis. We need a commitment to regular sonic sustenance. Take Jack White\u2019s Third Man Records, which is hosting daily livestream showcases for the foreseeable future, or even the Vienna State Opera, which is giving us the chance to don evening dress (well, trousers) and enjoy archive operas that, production-wise, show up The Yungblud Show. I\u2019ve also been hooked on Ben Gibbard from Death Cab for Cutie\u2019s nightly home studio sets, his gorgeous indie paeans untainted by the sexbots invading the group chat. I think I\u2019ve found my online safe room."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
