For seven years he toiled in a poor, remote village in China\u2019s Shaanxi province, unblocking sewage pipes, carrying heavy loads across the hills and sleeping in a flea-infested cave dwelling. He was lonely, bored, hungry, exhausted and anxious about his future. The experience shaped him for life, but not as one might expect. Xi Zhongxun, the Chinese president\u2019s father, was a Communist party veteran celebrated in later life as one of the \u201cimmortals\u201d. But when Mao unleashed the Cultural Revolution in 1966, he was brutally persecuted. Xi Jinping\u2019s elder half-sister died in the turmoil and the teenage Xi, along with 17 million peers, was sent to labour in the countryside. Those years have become Xi\u2019s creation myth. It is a potent political narrative. Despite his distinguished family heritage, Xi understands what life is like for those at the bottom of society, in a way that few politicians in the west or even his recent predecessors could. He has suffered, and he has risen above it. \u201cWhen I arrived ... I was anxious and confused ... When I left, at 22, my life goals were firm and I was filled with confidence,\u201d he has written. His experience helps to account for his genuine popularity, as well as his discipline and drive. Yet a man whose family was so deeply scarred by the excesses of Maoism is dismantling the changes designed to safeguard his party and country against further such disasters. After the Cultural Revolution, Mao\u2019s successors resolved that never again should one person hold such power. Deng Xiaoping, and other survivors such as Xi\u2019s father, sought to institutionalise politics. Their ideas were not codified, but they were crucial in limiting the power of the leader by setting a term limit and ensuring authority was exercised collectively. Xi has ripped up this unwritten rulebook. He is in charge, full stop. This week he became the only living leader since Mao to have his ideology enshrined in the party constitution under his name. His ideas are recorded as \u201cXi Jinping Thought\u201d, on a par with Mao Zedong Thought, rather than Deng\u2019s slightly less elevated \u201cTheory\u201d. As one analyst joked recently, the five most important people in China are \u201cXi, Xi, Xi, Xi and Xi\u201d. It looks increasingly likely that the norm of the leader stepping down after two five-year terms is on the way out. Many believe Xi plans to remain in power after 2022, whether by formally retaining the party leadership or by exercising his authority behind the scenes. Comparisons to Mao are overblown, though there are some parallels in Xi\u2019s approach: his demands for ideological purity, his call for China to play a leading role on the world stage and, above all, his personal appeal to the masses. Unlike Mao, he seeks the tacit support of the people, rather than their active intervention. Xi has none of Mao\u2019s love of disruption, only his insistence on dominance. He believes wielding his authority and that of the party more strictly can solve the multiplying problems that previous administrations failed to get to grips with, from rampant corruption to environmental damage. In Xi\u2019s vision, greater control will end stagnation and abuse \u2013 the alternative is stasis or, worse, an end to party rule. The leaders before Xi drew a simple lesson from the Cultural Revolution and from preceding disasters like the Great Leap Forward: strongmen breed instability and must be prevented at all costs. Xi appears to have reached a radically different conclusion: at least in this \u201cnew era\u201d, stabilising China requires the concentration of power. It just needs to be concentrated in the right, incorruptible hands \u2013 his."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
