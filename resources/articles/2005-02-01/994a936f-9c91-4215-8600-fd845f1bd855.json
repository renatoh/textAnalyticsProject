The Sweden international full-back had complained to the KNVB after a third of the fee Spurs paid Heerenveen ended up in the hands of agents. Edman lodged his complaint after missing out on his entitlement to a 20% cut of the fee stated in his contract. Heerenveen claimed he had agreed to waive this share during 11th-hour talks with them ahead of the transfer, however the court yesterday found partially in favour of the player. \"Edman has been awarded \u20ac180,000 from the profit Heerenveen made on the transfer,\" said Heerenveen's chairman Riemer van der Velde in a statement. \"Besides that Heerenveen has to pay a part of Edman's costs. \"Edman asked for \u20ac307,905.80 plus costs, [claiming] to be entitled to part of the transfer fee while Heerenveen said that Edman and his agent made a deal that led to Edman waiving his right. \"The [KNVB] has investigated the case and came to the conclusion that Edman, on the grounds of the talks [with Heerenveen and his agent], could not claim the amount in full but was entitled to a portion of it. There is no right to appeal.\" Graeme Souness conceded yesterday that Newcastle United may have to enter the Intertoto Cup next season to give the club European football. \"Every possibility will be considered,\" Souness said when asked about the Intertoto. \"I don't think we can rule out anything. It is very important for a club like this to be involved in Europe, for all the reasons you could possibly talk about. I think we would have to look at everything.\" It is a sign of the discordant times at St James' Park that the Intertoto Cup is even being discussed. But Wednesday's 1-1 draw at Manchester City left Newcastle 12th, 17 points behind Everton and 10 adrift of fifth-placed Liverpool."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
