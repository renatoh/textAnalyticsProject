Almost 15 years to the day, Arsenal\u2019s quest for that elusive striker took them to the door of Leicester\u2019s Jamie Vardy. But while Jeffers \u2013 then a 20-year-old from Liverpool who had scored 18 goals in 37 Premier League starts for boyhood club Everton \u2013 ended up moving to the capital, Leicester\u2019s top scorer decided to stay put despite Arsenal\u2019s \u00a320m bid triggering the 29-year-old\u2019s release clause. \u201cI was in contact [with Vardy]. He wanted to stay here, it\u2019s fantastic,\u201d Claudio Ranieri said on Thursday, before being asked if his decision showed that the dynamics have shifted in the Premier League. \u201cNo,\u201d came the response. \u201cIt depends on the character of players, of the family. Jamie wanted to stay here. He wanted to say thank you to everybody \u2013 the chairman, the fans, his team-mates. To say: \u2018We want to build again, I don\u2019t want to go.\u2019 He knows it will be hard but it\u2019s good. He\u2019s a fighter.\u201d Quite how Vardy\u2019s choice was received by Wenger remains a mystery, although the Arsenal manager hinted this week there would be a story to tell in his next book as his side prepare to meet Leicester on Saturday afternoon. Jeffers spent three years in north London, scoring just eight goals before being loaned back to Everton. He was eventually bought by Charlton for \u00a32.6m \u2013 a move which began a nomadic journey down the leagues, taking in Blackburn, Sheffield Wednesday, Motherwell and a two-month spell at Accrington in 2013. Now 35, Jeffers was last seen working on a voluntary basis for Everton\u2019s youth academy having failed to earn a move to Brunei DPMM in Singapore\u2019s top flight. Vardy appears unlikely to suffer the same fate following his meteoric rise from non-league to the England team. But after taking more than three weeks agonising over his future while at the European Championship before deciding to sign a new contract worth \u00a3100,000 a week, news of his rejection must have stuck in Wenger\u2019s craw. While Sylvain Wiltord ably filled the gap for a while in the Invincibles season, the Frenchman\u2019s hopes of transforming Theo Walcott into an ace goal poacher to rival Arsenal\u2019s former record scorer Ian Wright have failed to materialise. Despite his clear desire to add another striker to support the erratic Olivier Giroud, Wenger has not followed up his attempt to sign Vardy with any concrete bids for other reported targets, including Lyon\u2019s Alexandre Lacazette, and resorted to fielding Alexis S\u00e1nchez up front for last Sunday\u2019s 4-3 defeat to Liverpool. \u201cI think it is worth trying as he has the quality to go behind,\u201d he said of the Chile forward. \u201cHonestly, he did not have the most convincing game. I think as well he is one of them who is not completely ready physically.\u201cOn the flanks he uses a lot of energy by chasing back and I would like to use his energy sometimes a bit more efficiently by going behind the defenders as he is a good finisher. He has played centre forward at Barcelona, you know. \u201cIt is an important season for Theo, because last year he had a difficult period,\u201d added Wenger. \u201cHe can play as a striker and his numbers are excellent when he plays up front. We have Giroud, S\u00e1nchez, Walcott, [Chuba Akpom] and [Yaya] Sanogo who is still here but is injured at the moment \u2013 the players we buy have to be better. \u201cI believe a club like ours is focused on giving chances to the players we develop. We have a few strikers who have a chance, if we find the right players we buy. But if you ask people \u2018give me names\u2019, you see it is not that easy \u2013 look at a club like Real Madrid, who have they bought? Up front, it is very difficult.\u201d Given the long-term injuries to Gabriel Paulista and Per Mertesacker, however, Wenger has other priorities right now. Laurent Koscielny may be risked for the trip to face last season\u2019s most prolific duo in Vardy and Riyad Mahrez \u2013 who committed his future to Leicester this week amid reported interest from Arsenal \u2013 after Liverpool ran riot against the new signing Rob Holding and his defensive partner Calum Chambers. A move for Valencia\u2019s Shkodran Mustafi has yet to materialise, while Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s outstanding Uruguayan Jos\u00e9 Gim\u00e9nez has also been linked with a \u00a340m move. Yet if Arsenal\u2019s start to the season was less than ideal, Leicester\u2019s attempt to defend the title they won so miraculously in May has yet to take off. Saturday\u2019s surprise defeat to promoted Hull was preceded by a run of three losses in glamorous pre-season games against Paris Saint-Germain, Barcelona and the Community Shield against Manchester United, meaning their last victory came against the National League North side Nuneaton Town on 23 July. With Mahrez\u2019s future now resolved, though, Ranieri is expecting the form which helped them finish 10 points clear of runners-up Arsenal to make a swift return. \u201cI hope everybody plays with an extra edge,\u201d he replied when asked if Vardy would have a point to prove . \u201cNo, no, no. We have only to prove to ourselves that we are stronger, that we want to win.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
