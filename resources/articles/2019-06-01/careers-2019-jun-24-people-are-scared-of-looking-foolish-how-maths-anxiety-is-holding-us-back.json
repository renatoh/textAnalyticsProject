What may not seem so obvious is that many other people have felt the same way and that maths anxiety is a real problem. So much so that the Maths Anxiety Trust has been set up to raise awareness of the issue. It points out the problem could be contributing to a quarter of 11-year-olds being below the standard expected of their age group and nearly a third of students failing to obtain a grade 4 (grade C in the old grading system) or higher in maths GCSE exams. The trust believes these statistics reveal what academics have known for many years. A poll for the trust, conducted last year by Ipsos Mori, found more than a third of 15- to 24- year-olds feel anxious when shown a maths problem. The same applies to one in five British adults. Despite this high prevalence, the same research showed that 80% of adults have never heard of the term maths anxiety. This comes as little surprise to Celia Hoyles, professor of mathematics education at University College London (UCL). She helps with the trust\u2019s work because she feels it is vital people recognise maths anxiety is real and needs to be addressed if more young people are to study for qualifications that lead to careers in Stem industries. \u201cWith maths, there\u2019s a right or a wrong answer and that\u2019s why people can feel so anxious \u2013 they\u2019re scared of looking foolish,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s why people end up thinking they\u2019re not good at maths, which means we get fewer people studying it after GCSE.\u201d One issue that needs to be tackled is how maths is taught. Hoyles says that experts need to think beyond algebra and equations and understand how they can help young people realise that maths can be used to solve problems and widen their career choices. \u201cWe need teachers to be great communicators as well as fantastic maths teachers,\u201d she says. \u201cThat can be tough because we\u2019ve always had a shortage of great maths teachers in the country, as there are so many other careers available to people who are qualified to teach maths. We need teachers to be empathetic and to see other points of view, to understand where pupils are finding aspects of the subject difficult so they can be encouraged to overcome those hurdles.\u201d This is a crucial point for Ros McLellan, lecturer in teacher education and development at the University of Cambridge. She was recently part of a research team from the university that worked with the Nuffield Foundation to better understand maths anxiety. The study included a quantitative overview of maths standards and anxiety, as well as qualitative work with individual primary and secondary school pupils who kept diaries of their experiences studying the subject. \u201cWe found that two in three of the pupils who were living with maths anxiety were actually doing well in the subject,\u201d McLellan says. \u201cThis makes it tricky because it can mean that parents and teachers aren\u2019t aware of a child\u2019s anxiety. However, it does mean that students are more likely to drop the subject and not take it up at A-level or beyond.\u201d The other major take-out for McLellan was more encouraging: maths anxiety can come and go. \u201cPeople can feel maths anxiety and then overcome it,\u201d she says. \u201cMcLellan\u2019s advice is to instil in children that if they don\u2019t understand a maths problem, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re bad at the subject. Teachers must also help pupils overcome difficulties and never allow them to feel like they are no good at the subject. It\u2019s that feeling of failure that can lead to maths anxiety and young people dropping the subject and, in so doing, limiting their future career prospects in the Stem industries. Experience: \u2018Maths creates so many opportunities\u2019 Schools are short of maths teachers. Georgie Hart, education director at Sparx, asks if education technology offers a solution Dr Georgie Hart was a reluctant mathematician \u2013 English was her favourite subject at school, but she took a maths degree because she was good at it. But not until maths research led her to work for the World Health Organization did she begin to truly enjoy herself. \u201cI was analysing which interventions against tuberculosis were most effective. That was the moment I fell in love with maths. I\u2019d discovered the little-known area of operational research \u2013 which is about using statistics and maths to make better decisions \u2013 with a massive emphasis on human interaction with technology. I saw how maths could solve real-world problems.\u201d After a PhD in operational research, she\u2019s been working with education experts and coders for the past eight years to perfect education technology, which helps secondary school children learn maths. She\u2019s spent enough time in classrooms to know the value of good teaching. \u201cYou\u2019ll never replace the richness of teachers interacting with pupils. But even the best teacher in the world can\u2019t know what every pupil gets stuck on at any moment.\u201d She\u2019s now education director at technology company Sparx, where specialists have spent eight years developing education technology, which tailors maths tasks to individuals\u2019 differing abilities \u2013 in line with a wider shift in education towards personalising lessons to stretch every pupil at whatever stage they are. \u201cWe knew technology could make a difference but we didn\u2019t know exactly how,\u201d says Hart. \u201cOver time, we\u2019ve been brave and thrown out what doesn\u2019t work, and have drawn on cognitive science and learning research, and have eventually built something that teachers love using.\u201d UK schools have been chronically short of highly qualified maths teachers, and disadvantaged pupils haven\u2019t performed as well as the national average \u2013 some 58% of students eligible for free school meals have failed to achieve maths GCSE grade A*-C (now 9-4). But technology in the classroom often gets teachers and parents hot under the collar, prompting dire predictions of \u201crobot teachers\u201d replacing real people \u2013 and many education technology products have been launched with great fanfare in the past few years only to fall by the wayside. Simply digitising how maths is taught with appealing graphics and games isn\u2019t enough, says Hart \u2013 learning technology needs to be designed with deep understanding of how pupils learn and a healthy reality check around how teachers want to use it. Beware of bandying terms such as artificial intelligence (AI), she says. \u201cAI can be a very disempowering term for teachers, it\u2019s not helpful. But the concept of adaptive teaching allows teachers to do more of the job they love.\u201d And data doesn\u2019t always give the full picture, she says. \u201cIf a pupil scores highly at, say, ratios, but still feels very unsure, a teacher needs to know that. Or if a child is overconfident on a subject, but scores badly, a teacher must address that too. You need human intervention; it can\u2019t just be a case of \u2018the computer says no\u2019. It has to be a blend of a human being and technology.\u201d Through thousands of individually made video tutorials, Sparx helps explain concepts and provides an hour of bespoke maths homework for each student every week. \u201cSo if a child is really strong, he or she can explore, while others can use the video to address gaps in their knowledge,\u201d says Hart. She\u2019d like to see more links between industry and schools to inspire pupils and bring the maths curriculum to life. As a young mathematician, careers advisers pushed her towards accountancy \u2013 but, on graduation, she happily discovered her options were far broader. \u201cMaths genuinely creates so many opportunities.\u201d And if teachers could communicate the relevance of trigonometry, algebra, and other mathematical concepts in everyday life, then pupils could be more inspired earlier on, she says. \u201cHow does an architect use maths, for instance? Having someone say why that fractions class could be useful in the future would be so worthwhile.\u201d Download our women in engineering supplement (pdf)"}, "isHosted": false}}}
