Her long dark hair flies around us, whipping our faces. We sing along, \"Goodbye, Papa, please pray for me.\" Harvested cornfields roll past. It is nearing sunset. The end of summer. Dad smokes his driving cigar and we all feel slightly sick, but say nothing. Up front beside him, Mum sits contented, keeping an eye on the swaying caravan in her wing mirror, cocooned by her children. We journey home. The separation of September is palpable. Alison Blofeld Snapshot The youngest protester It was 1962, we lived in north Wales and according to the caption in the local paper, Y Cymro, at three and a half years old I was the youngest on the march. I'm on my father's shoulders; my mother would have been at home with my two baby sisters. Both my parents were leftwingers: my mum, Isabel, a communist from Chiswick, London; my dad, Elwyn, a socialist from Merionethshire. I was brought up to believe that, while it may seem pointless to some, going on demonstrations was an important part of registering one's disapproval of government policies (as well as voting!). Ten years later, I was involved in the protests that led to the establishment of the National Union of School Students at Parrs Wood high in Manchester. Nowadays I rap with Welsh language electro-dub duo Llwybr Llaethog, and have released songs condemning Britain's involvement in the Middle East. I'm still protesting against bombs, wars and inequalities, and this photograph shows where I'm from, in that respect. Pity my mum wasn't in the photo too. John Griffiths We love to eat Squeaky cheese curry Ingredients 1 packet halloumi cheese 6 shallots (or two small onions) 8-12 small new potatoes 1 clove garlic 2 dessert spoons of Thai masaman curry paste 1 can coconut milk 1 handful blanched peeled peanuts sesame oil for cooking fresh coriander to garnish Boil the new potatoes until just cooked. Drain and leave to cool. Roast the peanuts, remove and set aside to cool. Heat a little sesame oil in a wok over a medium heat and then toss the cubed cheese in the wok until it starts to brown, sealing the sides. Crush the garlic and saute in a skillet or frying pan. Add the onions/shallots and saute them until they start to go translucent but before they brown. Add the curry paste to the mix. Add three quarters of the coconut milk and bring to simmering point. Once the milk starts to bubble, turn the heat to low and cook for 10 minutes. Add the potatoes to the mix. Pour in the rest of the coconut milk and bring back to simmering heat. Stir in the peanuts and allow them to simmer for 2-5 minutes. Garnish with fresh coriander and serve. Squeaky cheese - two words that are among the select few able to coax the teenage boy of our household, me, down from his room and to the dinner table without actually dragging him. The name of my dad's signature dish causes me to rush downstairs and volunteer to set the table, an almost supernatural occurrence in itself. The meal in question came about when a vegetarian friend of ours came to visit. My family has curry at least once a week and my dad wanted to make one for when she arrived. Inspired by the use of paneer cheese in Indian cooking he added a packet of halloumi cheese to our weekly shopping cart. Halloumi, when eaten raw or lightly cooked, has a very strange texture and when you bite into it squeaks. This has caused some of the fussier eaters we know to shun this strange stuff, but I can't get enough of it. Dad used masaman curry paste, shallots and roasted peanuts for the rest, and when the night came and we all sat down for dinner, I had seconds, thirds and would have had fourths if there had been any left. Later, Dad attempted to christen the new dish halloumi masaman, but by then \"squeaky cheese curry\" had stuck. Our friend has since changed her diet and now eats meat but still, when she, or any of our non-carnivorous pals come round, I insist on having squeaky cheese curry.
