It's a pocket-size device - well, at 152mm x 75mm x 15mm, a jacket pocket-size device - that allows you to surf the internet, contract-free, on the move. The internal gubbins uses GPRS to access the web and compress your chosen page to the relevant dimensions and, remarkably, manufacturer Datawind's promised seven-second download time is pretty much on the money, unless you happen to be in the blackest of mobile blackspots or opening something with lots of pictures. This makes it rather similar, of course, to a number of mobile phones and BlackBerry-like devices. However, if your experience of mobile surfing has resulted in a bill the size of Bolivia's GNP, the PocketSurfer2 has one distinct advantage: a simple counter that tells you how many of your 20 hours a month you've used so far. This monthly deal is included in the purchase price - about \u00a3170, but less if you shop around - for the first year of your subscription. If you need more, you can go unlimited for an extra \u00a35.99 a month, which is the same monthly cost as your second year of subscription. Accordingly, it's pretty economical. In terms of handling, the PocketSurfer2 is not fantastic, as the keyboard, while a full QWERTY one, is flat and unresponsive and the four-direction, button-operated mouse is frustrating. However, after a couple of days of use, I was seeing the hassles as foibles rather than major negatives because of the speed, size and slickness of the package as a whole. The screen is impressive (although you wouldn't want to stare at it for hours), initial connection takes less than 60 seconds, it's simple to use, battery life is decent - albeit around three hours of reasonable usage rather than the five Datawind claim - and it can also handle Google Docs. There's no sound or video, but rumour has it they're coming in version 3 or 4. If you're looking to reply in length to emails when on the move, need access to huge sites or are addicted to YouTube, your best bet is probably still the shoulder-straining laptop or a web tablet such as the Asus Eee PC and a map of Wi-Fi hotspots and/or a mobile dongle. If, however, you're looking to remain in occasional contact, send simple email replies, surf for basic information or need a spot of satnav from time to time, the PocketSurfer2's a very decent alternative. And considerably lighter. Pros: Simple to use; surprisingly fast; very portable; economical Cons: ZX81-esque keyboard; no sound or video datawind.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
