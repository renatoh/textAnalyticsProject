It proved a good decision. The 40-year-old, who had previously managed Livingston and Wycombe Wanderers, led Norwich to promotion as the League One champions by an emphatic nine points from Leeds United, with Grant Holt scoring 24 goals in 39 league games. Lambert is an experienced football man who played under Martin O'Neill at Celtic and won the Champions League with Borussia Dortmund in 1997. But as he prepared to welcome Watford to Carrow Road for tonight's opening game of the season the Scot said he could never have imagined how his career has been transformed during the past 12 months. \"Not in a million years. We [Colchester] were under no illusions how hard it was going to be [against Norwich]. When you see the fan base you think you're going to be in for a right tough afternoon. And what happened then happened.\" Had he envisioned a return to Carrow Road as manager only 10 days later? \"Not at all. Was it three or four games Bryan lasted? [It was actually just two] That's never enough time. I'd never criticise the guy for what he's done because he's a big star at this club, it's just people make decisions. You have to try and win as many games as possible and hopefully get a board that are patient.\" A glance at the club's website suggests that the chairman, Alan Bowkett, is already anxious for further success. Asked by a fan in an email exchange if a top-six finish this season is the ambition, Bowkett said: \"A short answer for this one \u2013 yes.\" Discussing the longer term, Bowkett, who hopes to raise Carrow Road's capacity from 26,034 to 35,000, added: \"Given the changes in the parachute payment regime from the Premier League, it becomes ever more vital that Norwich achieve Premier League status over the next five years. Just one promotion to the Premier League would guarantee incremental income of \u00a390m, and this should be judged against our total revenue last year of \u00a317m.\" Lambert expertly deflected his chairman's comments by saying: \"I don't think you can ever predict where somebody can go. There is nothing wrong with being ambitious but you've also got to have realism. There's different factors. Finance \u2013 look at the Premier League at moment \u2013 it does get spent, and you think, 'Where is it all going to end?' But I know what I think [we can achieve].\" His team will not lack support. City have sold 20,550 season tickets, a number many Premier League clubs would be proud of. Now Lambert's challenge is to manage expectations. \"It's true,\" he said. \"I'm just back from Germany doing my refresher course for my Pro License. Before Germany went to the World Cup everybody thought, 'Nah, they're not going to be a force to be reckoned with'. All of a sudden they kick in and go as far as they did. \"But they were just talking over there about it being a start \u2013 [they were determined] not to get carried away with what's going to happen in later years. But they've put themselves back in that frame. \"It's something similar to here. We've given ourselves a terrific time last year but it's a start, it takes a bit of time. But we'll enjoy it, and the only way we'll enjoy it is if we win games.\" Lambert's quest begins this evening, when he hopes to include Holt, whose participation is in the balance due to a scheduled court appearance in Shropshire to answer motoring charges incurred while at his previous club, Shrewsbury Town."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
