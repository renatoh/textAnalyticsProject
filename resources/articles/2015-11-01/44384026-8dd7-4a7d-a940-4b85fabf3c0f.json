Some wags dubbed the adventures of Katniss and co \u201cBattle Royale with cheese\u201d \u2013 a reference to Japanese director Kinji Fukasaku\u2019s conceptually similar 2001 cult classic about violent feuding teenagers, and the novel it was based on. But director and Ozploitation maverick Brian Trenchard-Smith cracked open the genre many moons before the dour-faced Hunger Games heroine fired her first arrow or Fukasaku armed a class of ninth graders. Chaotic tournament of death extravaganza Turkey Shoot (first released in 1982) is a world-gone-wrong story of \u201csocial deviants\u201d who fight to survive in a horrible game where they are hunted and killed for sport. The so-called deviants are the underclass in a woebegone world and, as in any dystopian future story worth a pinch of totalitarian salt, there are elites above them. As in The Hunger Games, they are a group of well-dressed, alcohol-imbibing sickos who get their kicks out of watching poor sods suffer. The President Snow-like head honcho is Thatcher (Michael Craig), ruler of Camp 47. This is supposedly a prison where inmates are re-educated before re-entering society. Really, it\u2019s a breeding ground for human prey for the title event, during which heavily armed hunters chalk up a scoreboard of human scalps. Unarmed prisoners are given a head start to run into the camp\u2019s surrounding jungle where, if they survive until sundown, they are set free. Turkey Shoot kicks off in spooky Orwellian mode. Thatcher repeats an oft-recited dictum (\u201cFreedom is obedience. Obedience is work. Work is life\u201d) and Trenchard-Smith establishes hard-knocks hero Paul Anders (Steve Railsback) as a Paul Newman, Cool Hand Luke-on-steroids type character who refuses to be broken. Orwellian context setting gives way to bat-shit-crazy bedlam when the games begin. A grittier tone would have pushed the film\u2019s social commentaries closer to the surface, but Trenchard-Smith (whose other classics include BMX Bandits and Dead End Drive-In) was never one to hold back on pyrotechnics or gnarly thrills. There are exploding arrows, a lesbian sadist, a Teen Wolf-like monster and one of the most bad-arse prison guards in cinema history. Chief guard Ritter is played by giant, hulking, moustache-clad, shiny-scalped screen legend Roger Ward, whose best-known Australian work includes supporting roles in Mad Max and Stone. It\u2019s an unforgettable performance perfectly tuned to the film\u2019s highly energetic spirit. Action scenes are directed with everything-and-the-kitchen-sink aplomb, a jolty synthesiser-heavy score accompanying cinematography by John McLean who, unafraid to hold the frame, maintains a real sense of human-oriented excitement. Turkey Shoot\u2019s combination of high and lowbrow impulses creates a strange heady mixture \u2013 a sort of schlocky intellectualism. Its dreadfully serious, thought-provoking setup is blasted to smithereens by video-game style carnage engineered by people clearly in part motivated by the desire to blow things up. These mixed messages might have been why critics refused to come to the party. Phillip Adams spoke out against the film, describing it as \u201cunrivalled sadism and brutality\u201d. David Stratton observed \u201ca catalogue of sickening horrors\u201d. Nevertheless, Turkey Shoot was a big hit at drive-ins and later on video in Australia. It made the rounds overseas, playing in cinemas in over 50 countries. It was re-titled Blood Camp Thatcher for its UK release and Escape 2000 for the US; in America alone it netted over US$1.5m (adjusted for inflation, that exceeds US$3.5m). After the turn of the century the film re-entered the zeitgeist, spurred on by a wave of DVD rereleases and the championing of Quentin Tarantino. During the Sydney premiere of Kill Bill in 2003, the director dedicated it to Trenchard-Smith\u2019s notorious classic. A disappointing remake, stripping the material of its colour and off-the-wall vitality, was released last year. Perhaps a remake (or \u201cre-invention\u201d, as director Jon Hewitt called it) was doomed from the start. Turkey Shoot is many things; imitable it is not."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
