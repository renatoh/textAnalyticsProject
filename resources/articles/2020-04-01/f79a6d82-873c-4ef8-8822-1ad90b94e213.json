By Saturday evening, Johns Hopkins University\u2019s tally of US Covid-19 fatalities was at 19,877. Italy followed with 19,468. The US was also the first country to report 2,000 deaths in a single day, with 2,108 people dying in the previous 24 hours. New York, the hardest-hit US state, saw 783 deaths on Friday, raising the total to 8,627, governor Andrew Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany, the state capital. \u201cThat is not an all-time high, and you can see that the numbers [are] somewhat stabilizing \u2013 but it is stabilizing at a horrific rate,\u201d Cuomo said. Also on Saturday, the New York Times published a devastating report chronicling Donald Trump\u2019s repeated failures over several months to take the coronavirus crisis seriously, and how the president\u2019s suspicion of the so-called Deep State \u201ccolored\u201d his response even as the death toll began to soar. Researchers at Johns Hopkins had tallied 514,292 confirmed US cases. Spain followed with 161,852 and Italy ranked third in confirmed cases, at 152,271. There have been 29,507 reported recoveries in the US, the researchers also said. Worldwide coronavirus deaths now total 108,167. Confirmed cases have reached 1,765,030. Recorded worldwide recoveries total 396,693. The US coronavirus crisis is widely recognized to have been exacerbated by slow federal responses and patchwork state-level approaches. \u201cThe shortcomings of Mr Trump\u2019s performance have played out with remarkable transparency as part of his daily effort to dominate television screens and the national conversation,\u201d the Times reported, referring to the president\u2019s rambling and falsehood-ridden press briefings from the White House, which even Republican allies believe are hurting his popularity. No briefing was scheduled for Saturday. The Times article added more recent detail to the Guardian\u2019s in-depth investigation of Trump\u2019s missing six weeks published two weeks ago. Guardian reporting found that a botched rollout of testing, the decision to disband the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s pandemic response team and Trump\u2019s reliance on his own hunches over professional medical advice contributed to confusion and lack of leadership at a critical moment. Specifically, the Times notes that Trump\u2019s belief in the existence of a \u201cDeep State\u201d of bureaucrats and intelligence officials dedicated to his downfall \u2013 a conspiracy theory dismissed by even his closest allies as \u201cfor nut cases\u201d \u2013 caused him to ignore warnings from government experts. \u201cHe could have seen what was coming,\u201d the Times headline said. In a statement, White House spokesman Judd Deere said: \u201cWhile the media and Democrats refused to seriously acknowledge this virus in January and February, President Trump took bold action to protect Americans.\u201d On Friday, White House task force public health expert Dr Deborah Birx said there were signs the outbreak was stabilising, but warned: \u201cWe have not reached the peak.\u201d Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US expert on infectious diseases, recently said the US outbreak would approach its end when new infections numbered almost zero, with the number of deaths close behind. \u201cI believe that in a few months, hopefully, that we\u2019ll get it under control enough that it won\u2019t be as frightening as it is now, but it will not be an absent threat,\u201d Fauci told the Times. On MSNBC on Friday, Fauci was asked if the presidential election in November might be affected. The doctor indicated that was not his area of expertise, replying: \u201cI would hope that by November we would have things under such control that we could have a real degree of normality. That\u2019s my interest and my job as a public health person.\u201d Questions about normalcy are especially fueled by the stalled US economy, as coronavirus-related business closures and slowdowns have caused 16 million people to lose their jobs. Trump has pushed for a reopening of the economy and reportedly hopes to do so by May. But the president has also qualified this hope somewhat, saying at Friday\u2019s briefing: \u201cI want to get it open as soon as possible \u2026 I would love to open it. I\u2019m not determined.\u201d Trump is expected to announce a council of medical and business leaders to assist him with the \u201cbiggest decision I\u2019ve ever had to make\u201d: when to reopen America for business amid a global pandemic. In New York on Saturday, Cuomo also addressed questions about reopening the economy in his briefing. \u201cThis is no time for politics,\u201d he said. \u201cYou start to hear this dialogue on reopening, and you start to hear people with political theories on whether we should open faster, whether we should reopen sooner,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cThat is corrosive and destructive \u2013 and if we don\u2019t stop it, it will feed on itself. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if there\u2019s going to be a second wave or not.\u201d Health experts have warned that prematurely lifting stay-at-home restrictions could prompt a \u201cdeadly resurgence\u201d of coronavirus."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
