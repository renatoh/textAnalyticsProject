The French raider Wheels On Fire may have a better chance but Iffraaz appeals most, showing precocious strength to beat a subsequent winner on heavy going at Carlisle three weeks ago. Temple Of Heaven showed toughness to win a rough race at Newbury and his sights at that time were said to be set a little higher than this. He represents a yard that went close in Tuesday\u2019s Coventry Stakes with another fancied juvenile. 1 Afaak (Jim Crowley) 20-1 2 Clon Coulis (J P Spencer) 16-1 3 Raising Sand (Nicola Currie) 8-1 4 Stylehunter (R Havlin) 22-1 28 ran Also: 11-2 Jt Fav Kynren, New Graduate Non Runners: 5,20,24 And they\u2019re off ...

Irish success in this big-field handicap was virtually unknown for a long time but two of the last three runnings have been won by raiders and perhaps that has alerted others to an opportunity. Joseph O\u2019Brien comes here with the very interesting King\u2019s Field, who made a lot of progress in the three months after his September debut. Ridden sympathetically on his reappearance, he was a promising third in that Listed contest and surely has more to offer. Settle For Bay, an impressive winner of this last year, is 6lb higher and doesn\u2019t get the fast ground that seems to suit him. At a much bigger price, a return to form for Zhui Feng, the 2017 winner, would not totally surprise. He had a wind operation and was belatedly gelded over the winter and there was some promise in his reappearance third, though his stable is faring poorly. New Graduate is short on experience and has been rocketed up the weights for winning at Ripon in April. 1 Move Swiftly (D Tudhope) 9-1 2 Rawdaa (L Dettori) 4-1 3 I Can Fly (R L Moore) 7-2 Fav 17 ran Also: 8-1 Veracious 4th And they\u2019re off ...

She was beaten just a neck by Roaring Lion in the QEII when she last raced here and may even have won that day, but for the 2lb overweight put up by her jockey. She has not run to that level since but she was a fair sixth in the Lockinge and was given a lot to do last time. This return to soft going may help. Pretty Baby is feared but could have done without such a testing surface for this first attempt at a mile. Rawdaa, like Crystal Ocean, is normally the mount of Ryan Moore but has been inherited by Frankie Dettori. She was a close second to Lah Ti Dar at York and a never-nearer third around Kempton\u2019s tight turns to Agrotera, both bits of strong form. Agrotera, a well-backed handicap winner here last year, would need everything to fall right if she\u2019s going to score at this level. 1 Crystal Ocean (L Dettori) 3-1 2 Magical (R L Moore) 13-8 Fav 3 Waldgeist (P C Boudot) 4-1 8 ran And they\u2019re off ... Hunting Horn leads early ... with Crystal Ocean close up and Zabeel Prince in third ... The leader quickens up the pace ... Sea Of Class is last ... Magical is in third ... Crystal Ocean and Hunting Horn with Magical ... A proper battle which Crystal Ocean (Frankie Dettori up) wins from Magical. Very bad weather at Ascot now and must be getting into the ground News of a big whip ban coming in Magical \u2013 7/4 Crystal Ocean \u2013 4/1 Waldgeist \u2013 9/2 Sea of Class \u2013 9/2 Zabeel Prince \u2013 12/1 Deirdre \u2013 66/1 Hunting Horn \u2013 66/1 Desert Encounter \u2013 125/1 Full Oddschecker betting here The bookies coined it in on the Queen\u2019s Hat Stakes after Her Majesty sneakily wore the same colour (blue) for two days running. \u201cWe have probably had our best day ever in over thirty years of betting on the colour of the Queen\u2019s hat,\u201d said Rupert Adams of William Hill. \u201cNot only is the first time Her Majesty has worn the same colour two days in a row, but it also marks the best result for bookies in this market in recent history. Very different to last year, when punters successfully predicted the colour of the Queen\u2019s hat all of the five days of Royal Ascot,\u201d said a spokesperson for bemybet.com. William Hill betting for tomorrow: 2/1 Pink, 4/1 Green, 4/1 Yellow, 7/1 Purple, 7/1 White/Cream, 8/1 Blue, 14/1 Orange, 25/1 Red, 33/1 Black, 33/1 Brown. There is nothing remotely flashy about Crystal Ocean, who wins by grinding or not at all, but he might be the right ally for a race like this. He is better known for his exploits over further but has plenty of form at this distance and the rain has come in time to help him. There is little between him and Magical but the Irish filly has had little to beat so far this year and looks like being a shade too short in the betting. Sea Of Class may eventually prove herself the best in this field but this is a first run back for a horse whose big day is in October and she may not quite be ready for the battle this could become. Waldgeist was a ready winner of the Ganay on his reappearance and has three Group One wins to his name, which, in fairness, is three more than Crystal Ocean. Soft ground would be a help. Zabeel Prince also won a French Group One when last seen but his form leaves him a bit to find with several of these. His September second to Mustashry does not read so well, now that that one has been well beaten in the Queen Anne. 1 Dashing Willoughby (Oisin Murphy) 6-1 2 Barbados (W M Lordan) 20-1 3 Nayef Road (Andrea Atzeni) 16-1 13 ran And they\u2019re off ...

He\u2019s won it three times in the past four years and has a fine chance of doing so again with Norway. A 10-furlong winner as a juvenile, he was beaten only by the freakish Sir Dragonet at Chester and can be forgiven for fading in the Derby after helping to force a strong pace; he finished two lengths behind yesterday\u2019s Group One winner Circus Maximus. The cheekpieces come off to help him settle. Most interesting among the opposition is Joseph O\u2019Brien\u2019s Eminent Authority, well bred but lightly raced, who has hinted that this distance may suit. Aidan also fields Western Australia, who has more to give at marathon distances but may not have achieved much in a Listed success over Pythion last time. Godolphin\u2019s Jalmoud is by a Derby winner and out of an Oaks winner, and unbeaten this year. He scored by only a head in France last time but finished strongly. Frankie Dettori having a winner has brightened up proceedings somewhat \u2013 what will the sport be without the irrepressible, mercurial Italian. The day has needed it given the awful weather again. 1 Raffle Prize (L Dettori) 18-1 2 Kimari (John Velazquez) 13-2 3 Final Song (C Soumillon) 6-1 Fav 25 ran Also: 16-1 Liberty Beach 4th Non Runners: 8,12,15 And they\u2019re off ...

Weather update: Bucketing it down at Ascot now. There\u2019s already early betting on tomorrows\u2019s Queen\u2019s Hat Stakes. Nicola McGeady of Ladbrokes said: \u201cNobody expected Her Majesty to wear another blue hat with all money going on pink. We don\u2019t expect another blue hat tomorrow, with punters going in again on pink.\u201d Pink 2/1 Yellow 3/1 Green 3/1 Purple 6/1 Red 8/1 Blue 16/1 Orange 10/1 Cream/White 10/1 Silver 12/1 Gold 14/1 Brown 20/1 Black 50/1 Union Jack 500/1 Final Song \u2013 11/2 Kimari \u2013 8/1 Ickworth \u2013 10/1 Tango \u2013 11/1 Theory of Time \u2013 12/1 Divine Spirit \u2013 17/2 Lambeth Walk \u2013 16/1 Anna\u2019s Fast \u2013 18/1 Al Raya \u2013 18/1 Flippa the Strippa \u2013 25/1 Mighty Spirit \u2013 33/1 Raffle Prize \u2013 20/1 Liberty Beach \u2013 28/1 Daughter in Law \u2013 33/1 Flaming Princess \u2013 40/1 Partridge \u2013 50/1 Love Bracelet \u2013 50/1 Brand New Day \u2013 66/1 Shadn \u2013 66/1 Isabeau \u2013 80/1 Multiply by Eight \u2013 66/1 American Lady \u2013 100/1 Applecross \u2013 150/1 Ventura Flame \u2013 200/1 Too Shy Shy \u2013 250/1 Full betting here on Oddschecker 1st Blue 10-1 It\u2019s easy to see why Final Song is near the top of the market, given that she was impressive over this course and distance last month, on ground roughly as soft as is likely today. But she\u2019s a short price in a big field and comes from the Saeed bin Suroor yard that has had just one juvenile winner at Royal Ascot in the past 20 years and doesn\u2019t really specialise in speedsters. At slightly bigger odds, Ickworth has achieved more in winning a Listed race in Ireland, travelling strongly throughout. Her trainer, Willie McCreery, does well with his five-furlong runners. Both are Godolphin runners and the blue team even has another fancied runner in Divine Spirit, who won in a good time at Windsor. Seeking to win this for the third time, Wesley Ward fields Kimari, an easy winner on dirt in April. If she also copes well with rain-softened turf, she is more versatile than most juveniles. Flippa The Strippa has her fans but comes from the Charlie Hills yard that may have gone off the boil, with two winners from 30 runners in the past fortnight and a couple of disappointments yesterday. Don\u2019t back these 2.30 pm 8 Emten 12 Good Vibes 15 Kemble 5pm 5 Crazy Horse 5.35pm 9 Ivatheengine 23 Lady Quickstep It\u2019s raining again. Matt Chapman is back on ITV Racing after losing his voice yesterday. He\u2019s sounding very hoarse (sorry). Oisin Mutphy has been speaking to Sky Sports Racing about his failing a breath test for alcohol before racing began at Salisbury on Sunday. Here are the runners and riders and Sir Mark Prescott has been given a cracking draw ... For those of you who take a niche interest in these things (and very important matters with regard to form study) ... More than 30 years after Gay Kelleway became the first female jockey to ride a Royal Ascot winner, we are still waiting for the second. Could it happen today? Six of today\u2019s runners are to be ridden by women, which would not be many in the context of a normal race-meeting but is quite a lot by the standards of Royal Ascot, where equality of opportunity does not reign. Nicola Currie will be aboard the second-favourite, Raising Sand, in the Royal Hunt Cup at 5pm, and she also has a couple of outsiders to ride, Emten in the first and Paper Star in the last. Hayley Turner will also be in the opening Queen Mary on the outsider Applecross, while Hollie Doyle has half a chance in the Queen\u2019s Vase on Nate The Great. Doyle will also be on Taxiwala at a big price in the Windsor Castle. Here\u2019s Kelleway reminiscing about the time she beat Piggott, Carson, Cauthen and Eddery aboard Sprowston Boy. Yesterday\u2019s gamble on blue paid off for those who wade in and pink is all the rage this time. All the betting is here via Oddschecker with pink at a short price. A Bookmakers.tv spokesperson said: \u201cPunters got it spot on yesterday as Her Majesty opted for a blue number. And despite talk of a plunge with certain firms in yellow, those who followed the form book and kept blue on side were rewarded. \u201cThe bookies are taking no similar changes today with pink \u2013 another stand out selection on all known form \u2013 opening up at evens. And as the Queen is known to wear pink on either the Wednesday or Thursday of the five-day meeting, it seems that punters believe today is the day. And with over 50% of bets going on pink, it would be no surprise to see it go odds on before betting is suspended. \u201cInterestingly in the hat stakes firms are suspending betting much sooner each day than they historically used to. Once upon a time the market was left up as late as possible to try and tempt a headline-grabbing market move, but it seems like in the modern era of bookmaking this novelty market is managed just as rigorously as the main markets, even if the average stake is \u00a38.\u201d Latest betting: Evens Pink, 3-1 Yellow, Green, 6-1 Purple, 8-1 Red, 10-1 Orange, Cream/White, Blue, 12-1 Silver, 14-1 Gold, 20-1 Brown, 50-1 Black, 500-1 Union Jack. bettingexpert have given us a form guide (below) for all the hat colours worn by the Queen since 2005. Pink and blue have made up 57% of her choices on the Tuesday in that time, while pink has also featured most on the Wednesday and Thursday of the five-day meeting. Green, which the Queen has worn 11 times since 2005, and white, also 11, are her next most-fancied hat colours and look likely to get a showing this week. Aidan O\u2019Brien 2 William Haggas 1 Charlie Appleby 1 David O\u2019Meara 1 Ian Williams 1 O\u2019Brien fired 11 arrows at yesterday\u2019s card and a couple of bullseyes is a fair return for the master of Ballydoyle. It\u2019s a better return, anyway, than he has managed for a couple of years on day one. Appleby has now had at least one winner at Royal Ascot for five consecutive years, which is not bad, considering he\u2019s only had a licence since July 2013. Remarkably, Haggas was having his first success here for seven years. Williams was breaking his duck at the Royal meeting, while O\u2019Meara has won here before but not in a Group One until Lord Glitters came along. Ryan Moore 2 wins Danny Tudhope 2 James Doyle 1 Richard Kingscote 1 In each of the last two years, Moore was winless on opening day and ended Ascot as top jockey, so what will he achieve this time after such an excellent start? Meanwhile, the under-appreciated Tudhope has doubled his career tally at Royal Ascot and got his first Group One here, in the Queen Anne on Lord Glitters. Any new fans will want to know that he has just a couple of rides today, Move Swiftly (4.20) and So Beloved (5.00).

The remainder of the week is due to be generally drier with the risk of occasional showers. Temperatures through the week are forecast to be between 19 and 22 degrees Celsius. Clerk of the Course Chris Stickels said at 8.00am today: \u201cWe are forecast possible further showers during the day but we were fortunate to miss most of the heavy showers overnight.\u201d GoingStick Readings at 8.30am today: Stand side: 8.2, Centre: 8.4, Far Side: 8.2.

Here are our tipster Chris Cook\u2019s selections for the second day. Stay here and we\u2019ll have an in-depth preview from Chris for every race as the afternoon goes on. 2.30 Queen Mary Stakes Ickworth 8-1 3.05 Queen\u2019s Vase Stakes Norway 3-1 3.40 Prince of Wales\u2019s Stakes Crystal Ocean 4-1 4.20 Duke Of Cambridge Stakes I Can Fly (nap) 9-2 5.00 Royal Hunt Cup (Handicap) King\u2019s Field (NB) 20-1 5.35 Windsor Castle Stakes Iffraaz 16-1 ... which would amount to four winners for Ireland, three of them for the O\u2019Brien clan, and that doesn\u2019t seem at all unlikely. It would also mean doubles for Frankie Dettori (Crystal Ocean, Iffraaz) and Ryan Moore (Norway, I Can Fly). Congratulations to fallguy99, who won Tuesday\u2019s competition on a final score of +13.88, thanks to Circus Maximus (10-1), Addeybb (5-1) and Arizona (15-8). That saved us having to give the prize to someone who\u2019s called themselves dirtynorthernbastard (+13.38), while Lindsey6677 (+13) was also close up. You could win a \u00a350 bet from Ladbrokes Coral by proving your tipping prowess on today\u2019s races. All you have to do is give us your selections for all of today\u2019s races at Ascot. As ever, our champion will be the tipster who returns the best profit to notional level stakes of \u00a31 at starting price. Non-runners count as losers. Please post all your tips in a single posting, using the comment facility below, before the first race at 2.30pm. There are six races at Ascot today and you must post a single selection for each race. Our usual terms and conditions, which you can read here will apply, except that this will be a strictly one-day thing. If we get a tie after all the races have been run, the winner will be the one who posted their tips earliest out of those with the highest score. If you don\u2019t win today, don\u2019t despair. We are running an identical competition on each day of the Royal meeting, up to Friday. Post your tips or racing-related comments below. The forecast for Ascot on Tuesday afternoon was possible thunderstorms \u2013 the sort of thing you can take shelter from and then carry on with enjoying the rest of the day. Instead, we got several hours of fairly light but very steady rain which turned the ground from good to good-to-soft and finally to soft, but the good news is that there has been no significant rain at the course since yesterday evening and the going has consequently improved to be good-to-soft on the straight course and soft, good-to-soft in places on the round. \u201cThe forecast is for possible further showers during the day,\u201d Chris Stickels, the clerk of the course, said this morning, \u201cbut we\u2019ve been fortunate and missed most of the heavy showers overnight.\u201d It had been three years since a race at Royal Ascot had been run on anything other than good-to-firm ground \u2013 last year\u2019s meeting was at the start of the heatwave \u2013 and it was just a little deflating to start the week with a reminder of how susceptible this showpiece event can be to the weather. But Ryan Moore and Danny Tudhope both rose to the occasion with doubles, and Moore\u2019s ride on Circus Maximus was a perfect example of an outstanding jockey turning every little edge to his advantage to win to beat the market leaders on a 10-1 chance. We await news this morning on whether Sea Of Class, one of the week\u2019s biggest stars, will be allowed to take her chance in the Prince Of Wales\u2019s Stakes. She has not seen a racecourse since her fast-finishing second behind Enable in last year\u2019s Arc after passing almost the entire field in the straight, and while it would be a blow to the meeting to lose her, a return to Paris in October is a number one priority. William Haggas will not want to risk leaving her season behind with a hard race on testing ground. As yet, there are just a handful of non-runners on the card, the most notable being Good Vibes, one of the best of the British-trained runners, in the opening Queen Mary Stakes. She was scratched yesterday afternoon due to a bad scope, which leaves Saeed bin Suroor\u2019s Final Song as the most opponent for Wesley Ward\u2019s Kimari as the American attempts to win this race for the third time in five seasons. Kimari\u2019s challenge is backed up by her stable companion Anna\u2019s Song, but soft ground is an unknown for both and one runner to catch the eye at a big price is Liberty Island, whose trainer, John Quinn, saddled the 25-1 winner Signora Cabello 12 months ago. The Royal Hunt Cup is the big betting race of the day and the course specialist Raising Sand could yet start favourite to provide his rider Nicola Currie with only the second victory for a female rider at the Royal meeting and the first for 32 years. Jamie Osborne\u2019s course specialist is at his very best with a little cut in the ground and is closing in on New Graduate at the head of the market at around 15-2 having been a 12-1 chance a couple of days ago. Chris Cook\u2019s tips for day two are here and all the news on market moves, non-runners and, from 2.30pm BST, the winners and losers will be here as the day unfolds."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
