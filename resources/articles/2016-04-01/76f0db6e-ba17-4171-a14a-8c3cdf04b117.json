'Occasionally', new labels to say", "bodyText": "The food giant that makes Mars bars is to introduce new labelling advising consumers that its Dolmio pasta meal kits and ready-made sauces \u2013 high in sugar, salt and fat \u2013 should be eaten only occasionally. As part of a five-year global health initiative being announced on Thursday, Mars Food is introducing new labels on its savoury pasta and rice products to help shoppers distinguish between \u201ceveryday\u201d foods and those which should only be eaten occasionally \u2013 ideally no more than once a week. The company is to revamp its UK product range and reformulate many of its best-known foods, including its Dolmio pasta sauces \u2013 which have come under fire from health campaigners \u2013 by reducing salt, added sugar and fat. In other major brands such as Uncle Ben\u2019s savoury rice products it will expand healthier, multi-grain options to include more whole grains and vegetables. Mars Food said the move is designed to help families by giving them easier-to-understand nutritional information as well as a wider range of healthy choices. George Osborne recently responded to the growing clamour by announcing plans for a tax on sugary soft drinks intended to make children healthier and cut the \u00a35bn a year cost of obesity to the NHS. But in the food sector the government relies on the industry to do more to make products healthier by reformulating them. In the first step of the five-year initative in the UK, all Dolmio lasagne meal kits, lasagne sauces, oven bake kits (macaroni and cheese, carbonara, creamy tomato) and Dolmio pesto will be labelled as \u201coccasional\u201d foods. The company has pledged to cut salt by an average of 20% by 2021 and reduce added sugar in some sauces and light meals by 2018. Mars Food is part of Mars Incorporated, whose chocolate business makes Mars bars, M&amp;Ms, Maltesers and Snickers, although the new initiative will only apply to Mars Food products \u2013 which also include Seeds of Change pasta sauces. The Mars move was described as \u201cunambitious\u201d by the campaign group Cash (Campaign for Action on Salt). Graham MacGregor, professor of cardiovascular medicine at Queen Mary University of London and chairman of Cash, said he welcomed it \u201calthough it is ... not going to solve the health problems in the UK. \u201cWhat is needed is what the British Retail Consortium has asked the government for \u2013 a mandatory system of regulated targets for the reduction of sugar, saturated fat and salt.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
