In a just world, the BBC would instead compress much of the rest of its output into The Inane Populist Drivel Hour, and free its schedules for more of the likes of tonight's profile of Alasdair Gray, Miranda Sawyer's interview with rapper Tinie Tempah, a rumination on the film The Kids Are Alright, a preview of Nina Raines' new play Tribes, and Damien Hirst's selection of favourite BBC archive footage, including moments with Bacon, Duchamp and Warhol. AM The Taking Of Prince Harry 9pm, Channel 4 This drama-documentary, which speculates on what sort of co-ordinated response would be triggered were Prince Harry to be kidnapped while on active duty in Afghanistan, has already been condemned as \"deeply distasteful\", enacting as it does scenes of His Highness being manhandled by swarthy locals and paraded in front of cameras. However, if anything, it's a little bit too worshipful, hypothetically depicting him as a warrior hero and pride of his people. DS Never Mind The Buzzcocks 10pm, BBC2 Continuing its post-Amstell coping strategy of a HIGNFY-style rotating host, Buzzcocks is back for a 24th series, showing more longevity than most of the popstars it has on it. The surprisingly affable Mark Ronson takes the chair and attempts to rein in returning team leaders Phill Jupitus and Noel Fielding, who get Alesha Dixon, Mollie King from the Saturdays, Tinie Tempah and Paul Foot as their guests. Future hosts look likely to include Josh Groban, Tim Westwood and Frankie Boyle. No Dappy from N-Dubz? RN Pretty Little Liars 8pm, Viva This new US teen series, about a clique of queen bees in high school, takes a pinch of several successful films and series and turns it into a show that's both rubbish and frustratingly watchable, a bit like Lindsay Lohan's career. There's a big dose of Desperate Housewives, in the shape of a missing friend and a mystery to be solved, as well as touches of Mean Girls and I Know What You Did Last Summer. Tonight, we meet the gang, experience several heavy-handed flashbacks, and get sucked in, despite knowing better. RN Edgar Allan Poe: Love, Death And Women 9pm, BBC4 Crime novelist Denise Mina presents a rumination on the life and work of Poe, with particular focus on the intense and \u2013 not infrequently\u2013 weird relationships the author and poet conducted with the women in his life. As Mina pursues her story between New York, Baltimore and various bits of Virginia, dramatised reconstructions illuminate the connection between Poe's enduringly potent fiction and his peculiar personal life \u2013 not the least of which was marrying his 13-year-old cousin when he was twice her age. AM Nikita 9pm, Living The toughest part of Nikita's quest to bring down the rogue black ops agency Division seems to be finding allies. The best she can get is a conspiracy theory blogger who has been fed info from a mysterious inside source. Division know there is a leak, but have they got the right suspect? All that is really required from a light, bright mainstream action show like this is beautiful women, explosions and guns. It delivers all that but they throw in plenty of nice twists and, unusually for this sort of thing, the plot actually gets to advance. Not bad.
