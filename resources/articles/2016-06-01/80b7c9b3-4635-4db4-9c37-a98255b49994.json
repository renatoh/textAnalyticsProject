The justice select committee called for some charges to be rescinded as it dismissed \u201csuperficial\u201d government excuses for failing to provide evidence to justify successive steep rises. The parliamentary group acknowledged that Ministry of Justice finances had not been ringfenced from austerity but warned that access to justice must be prevail over \u201ccost recovery\u201d. The scathing comments from the committee, chaired by the Conservative former barrister Bob Neill, reflect fears within the legal profession that access to justice is in danger of being restricted to the wealthy and that commercial litigants will be deterred from bringing cases to UK courts. In recent years the department has levied more \u201cenhanced\u201d fees \u2013 greater than the cost of the hearing involved \u2013 in order to cross-subsidise the legal system. The main rises have been: \u2022 Employment tribunal fees of up to \u00a31,200 introduced in 2013, which led to a 70% drop in the number of cases being brought. \u2022 Fees for financial claims for sums over \u00a3300,000 going up five-fold last year, from \u00a31,920 to \u00a310,000. A plan to double that level to \u00a320,000 has temporarily been shelved. \u2022 The price of a divorce going from \u00a3410 to \u00a3550 \u2013 although the average cost of uncontested proceedings is estimated to be only \u00a3270. The MoJ is also considering increases of 600% for asylum and immigration tribunal fees. Applications for decisions on papers will rise from for \u00a380 to \u00a3490 and for oral hearings from \u00a3140 to \u00a3800. The committee\u2019s report says: \u201cThe introduction of fees set at a level to recover or exceed the full cost of operation of the court requires particular care and strong justification. Where there is conflict between the objectives of achieving cost recovery and preserving access to justice, the latter objective must prevail.\u201d On divorce fees, the MPs state that the latest increase, \u201cwhich is approximately double the cost to the courts of providing the service, is unjustified\u201d. They add: \u201cIt cannot be right that a person bringing a divorce petition, in most cases a woman, is subject to what has been characterised in evidence to us as effectively a divorce tax. We recommend that the increase in the divorce petition fee to \u00a3550 be rescinded.\u201d On employment fees, the report describes the justice minister Shailesh Vara\u2019s \u201cheavy reliance on the figure of 83,000 cases dealt with at Acas early conciliation to support his contention that access to justice has not been adversely affected by employment tribunal fees [as], even on the most favourable construction, superficial.\u201d If the six-fold increase in asylum and immigrations fees goes ahead, the report says, \u201cthere is a danger that they will deny vulnerable people the means to challenge the lawfulness of decisions taken by the state about their \u2026 status.\u201d The select committee says there have been inconsistencies in the government\u2019s account of its review of the impact of employment tribunal fees. The report adds: \u201cIt is difficult to see how a minister can urge his officials to progress a review which they apparently submitted to him four months or more previously.\u201d The report has still not been published. The MPs add: \u201cThere is a troubling contrast between the speed with which the government has brought forward successive proposals for higher fees, and its tardiness in completing an assessment of the impact of the most controversial change it has made. \u201cWe find it unacceptable that the government has not reported the results of its review one year after it began and six months after the government said it would be completed.\u201d The select committee report does not object to the principle of charging fees to court users, since \u201csome degree of financial risk is an important discipline for those considering legal action.\u201d Neill said: \u201cWe understand the financial pressures on ministers in a department with unprotected spending. We also understand that the MoJ does not always have the luxury to be as rigorous and meticulous in preparing the ground for controversial policies as it might wish. But it is important that in such circumstances the ministry is frank about that fact and does not represent the quality of its evidence base to be higher than it is. \u201cThe MoJ has argued that changes to employment law and the improving economic situation, as well as the pre-existing downward trend in the number of employment tribunal cases being brought, may account for part of the reduction in the number of cases. These may indeed be facts but the timing and scale of the reduction following immediately from the introduction of fees can leave no doubt that the clear majority of the decline is attributable to fees.\u201d Gillian Guy, Chief Executive of Citizens Advice, said: \u201cPeople are being priced out of challenging employers that dismiss them unfairly, discriminate against them or withhold wages. \u201cFour in five people who we help with problems at work would be put off making a claim to an employment tribunal because of high fees. Many people would have to save for six months to afford fees of \u00a31,200, and for some people the fees are higher than the amount they are claiming. \u201cThe justice select committee is right to highlight that at their current level employment tribunal fees put access to justice at risk. The Government should use this opportunity to consider how they can make employment tribunals a more affordable option.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
