No, this is not some kind of joke, nor another excuse to stage a comeback for Norman Wisdom - a true-blue Tory who, as the bungling nemesis of capitalist running dog Mr Grimshaw, was a star in Stalinist Albania. But stranger things have happened. Not a lot of people know this, but for a good decade from the late 1960s, Albanian films were among the most watched in the world. The reason was simple. That nice Mr Mao deemed them the only foreign fare ideologically safe enough to be shown to hundreds of millions of Chinese in the wake of the Cultural Revolution. Which is why, from time to time, you will come across Chinese directors paying handsome tribute to some \"European classic\" no one outside Tirana has heard of. Are these films about to shake the world again, as a festival of Albanian film in Bristol this weekend claims? Well, not quite. For a start, making a film in Albania is a bit like climbing the Matterhorn in flip-flops with the aid of a toothpick. While the old dictator Enver Hoxha - who fancied himself as a bit of a matinee idol - held the country in his malign spell (1944-85), the state studios in the shadow of Mount Dajti above Tirana were a veritable mini-Cinecitta, churning out up to 17 films a year. Most were not half bad by the standards of the time, heavy with Italian and Russian influence, and girded by a stable of top-notch writers that included Petrit Roka, Nexhati Tafa and Ismail Kadare, a Hoxha favourite and the eminence grise of Albanian letters. Unfortunately, Albania has struggled to make as many films in all the years since. What wasn't pillaged from the studios in the two terrible bouts of collective madness in the wake of the fall of communism, and again seven years later when the country's first experiments in free-market capitalism collapsed, was otherwise purloined. Yet some pretty remarkable work has come out of the rubble to counterpoint the tsunami of foreign films that feature Albanians as either gormless victims or rapacious, amoral bandits. (Italian and Greek cinema are particularly obsessed with this idea, and even Casino Royale has a cartoon Albanian baddie.) The most feted films have been made by Gjergj Xhuvani, who popped up at Cannes six years ago with Slogans, a beautifully crafted morality tale of life under Hoxha that looked like a letter from some distant time and place. Despite being hailed as minor masterpiece and one of the discoveries of the festival, the film disappeared. A similar fate befell his recent follow-up set during the second world war, Dear Enemy, which won a Sundance script award. Both will be shown this weekend with Tirana Year Zero, Fatmir Koci's breathless attempt to try to come to terms with what happened to Albania in the first wildly unstable years after the collapse of communism, when history went into a kind of hyperdrive from which the country is only now, 16 years later, beginning to recover. To outsiders, it may look so arch as to be almost mad, but for anyone who was there it looks more like a documentary. Such is the parlous state of affairs in Albania that the film which broke the mould in the 1990s - Saimir Kambaro's Death of a Horse, written while Albania was still closed to the outside world - has had to be pulled from the festival at the last minute. There simply was not a print in good enough state to be seen. Another tragedy in a country where so much has been devalued or destroyed, and where artists now struggle with a new and nastier version of censorship: poverty, the most powerful gag of all. \u00b7 Albanian Film: A New Wave in Cinema runs at the Watershed, Bristol, until Sunday.
