The Brue is already below high-tide level when it reaches Godney Moor, and a long stretch of the Parrett falls at only one foot per mile. We encountered a very different terrain and a different kind of river when we took a detour through rural Shropshire close to Telford, named after the maker of canals, bridges and viaducts, one of the men who, in the 18th century, worked on the natural resources of this landscape of steep, wooded hills and made it the cradle of the industrial revolution. The Severn has already curled through Wales, passed Shrewsbury and become a substantial waterway by the time it reaches this stretch near Coalport. Coal had long been exported to Gloucester on barges that returned with cider and hay. The gorge where we walked has recovered much of its rustic quiet, but is close to where Abraham Darby, a Quaker manufacturer, first produced iron in a coke-fired furnace, and started a thriving industry. His grandson, Abraham Darby III, built the cast-iron bridge we stood and marvelled at, the first in the world, with a great semi-circular arch. It was opened in 1781. Below Gloucester, the Severn widens towards the Bristol Channel, and way downstream the Parrett crawls out through the slime of its own flat estuary to join it. The Gloucestershire Avon emerges from between the sheer, 240ft walls of the Clifton gorge, a setting dramatic enough to inspire Brunel to devise a suspension bridge whose daring and elegance still take the breath away. Back in Somerset we were in our familiar world of stone bridges and humbler crossings for man and beast over streams that drain the pasture."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
