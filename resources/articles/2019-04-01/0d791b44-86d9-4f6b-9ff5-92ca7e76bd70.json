According to the Wall Street Journal, the administration is preparing to announce the move as early as Monday. It would mark the first time the US has designated a branch of the armed forces of a foreign government as a terrorist group. The US state department declined to comment on the report on Friday evening. Experts said it was unclear how much concrete difference the terrorist designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) would make. It is already heavily sanctioned by the US as a terrorist supporter, and Iran is designated a state sponsor of terrorism. \u201cIt is hard to imagine a bigger sanctions stick than that,\u201d said Richard Nephew, a former principal deputy coordinator for sanctions policy at the state department, and the author of The Art of Sanctions. \u201cFrankly, I still don\u2019t believe that this is consistent with the intent of the underlying law, which was to target non-state actors.\u201d The move, if carried out, is likely to increase the trepidation on the part of foreign companies when it comes to trading with or investing in Iran. The IRGC controls a large slice of the Iranian economy (the Trump administration claims up to half), and the US treasury and state department have stressed that the onus is on foreign companies to find out if the partners they deal with in Iran are tied to sanctioned groups. \u201cThis is uncharted territory. We haven\u2019t done this before,\u201d said Ariane Tabatabai, an Iran expert at the Rand Corporation. \u201cIt is a sign the US is prepared to fully escalate \u2018maximum pressure\u2019 but what is lacking is a clear endgame. There is a confusion of means and ends. The administration sees the damage inflicted as success. But that\u2019s not how it works. \u201cThe IRGC has always thrived under pressure,\u201d Tabatabai, the coauthor of a book on Iranian foreign policy, Triple Axis: Iran\u2019s Relations with Russia and China, added. The Wall Street Journal report said that senior Pentagon officials were apprehensive about the move, fearing it could provoke a backlash against US troops in the region. Mohammad Ali Shabani, an Iran scholar at Soas University of London, said that if the designation is announced, the Iranian government is likely to respond in kind. \u201cFirst and foremost, the Iranian parliament may move to label the US military a terrorist organization,\u201d Shabani said, but he added he thought the Iranian military would avoid being drawn into a direct clash with US forces in the region. He argued that it marked an attempt by Iran hawks in the administration, like the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and the national security adviser, John Bolton, to box in future decision making on Iran. \u201cThe point of all of this is to constrain Trump\u2019s deal-making instinct as much as possible and make it as difficult as possible for the next US president to return to sanity on Iran.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
