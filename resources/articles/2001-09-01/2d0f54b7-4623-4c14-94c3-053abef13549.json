In London, the FTSE 100 index closed at its lowest level in four years, down 164 points - or 3.5% - at 4,556. After losing almost \u00a340bn of its value yesterday, the index of top British companies has fallen by nearly 10% since hijacked planes slammed into Manhattan's twin towers last Tuesday. In continental Europe, Germany's Dax index lost nearly 6% to close at 3,808 points and the CAC index in Paris was off 3% at 3,738 points. On Wall Street, traders likened the sell-off to the one which followed Japan's attack on Pearl Harbour in 1941. By lunchtime in New York, where shares were paralysed for four days following the attack, the Dow Jones was down 310 points at 8,448. Over four days, the index of America's top companies has lost almost 1,200 points, with volatility at its most extreme since Russia's economic crisis in 1998. With the deployment of 100 American warplanes in the Middle East already rattling nerves, dealers were further unsettled by remarks by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, that economic activity \"ground to a halt\" last week. Wall Street ignored his assurances that the long-term prospects were largely unaffected. \"Much economic activity ground to a halt last week,\" Mr Greenspan told the senate banking committee. \"But the foundations of our free society remain pronounced, from consumer and financial markets to the airline and auto industries.\" In the City, shares changed hands at the fastest pace yet since the terrorist attack. Shares in British Airways, which yesterday announced 5,200 new job losses, and major insurance companies such as Prudential, CGNU and Royal &amp; Sun Alliance, were among the hardest hit. The atmosphere was sombre as traders began to focus on the economic impact after being distracted by the shock of the human tragedy. \"For the first time in a long time we're in a bear market, and the world has changed so much since the last time,\" said one City source. \"More people own shares and have their own pensions.\" While stocks tumbled on fear of war, oil prices gave back some of their recent gains on expectations of reduced supply and bonds, a traditional safe haven, remained relatively steady. The Fed, which announced an emergency half-point cut in interest rates on Monday, is expected to embark on further cuts if confidence continues to evaporate from the markets. On Wall Street, more profit warnings from companies hit by the fallout from last week's terrorist attacks did little to soothe nerves. The newspaper group Tribune, which owns the Chicago Tribune, said its advertising revenue had collapsed. Publishing company Knight Ridder, software firm Sybase and battery firm Rayovac all issued warnings. Mary Farrell, an equity strategist at UBS PaineWebber, said: \"The talk of sending fleets and planes to the Middle East is not exactly confidence-inspiring - it adds to the feeling of unease.\" Figures showing a fall in US housebuilding starts in August added to the gloom. One in four shares in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index was at a 12-month low."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
