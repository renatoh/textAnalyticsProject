The call comes ahead of GCSE results on Thursday. Commenting on the results of a CBI survey which revealed the majority of employers were dissatisfied with school leavers' maths and English knowledge, Mr Lambert said: \"We have to sharpen the skills of more of our young people. \"The implications of not doing so are grave. We simply cannot match the labour costs of India, China and other emerging economies and only a higher-skilled workforce will keep the UK competitive.\" The 2007 CBI/Pertemps employment trends survey showed 52% of employers were dissatisfied with 16-year-olds' grasp of basic literacy, with a similar percentage (50%) unimpressed by their basic numeracy. Alarmingly, the survey also discovered that an increasing number of employers are having to top up their recruits' skills, with 15% offering maths training and 13% training staff in basic literacy. Last year, only 47% of school leavers achieved the grade C minimum in maths and English which is commonly demanded by employers, and 340,000 young people left school without them. Simple mental calculations, articulation, concise communication and interpreting written instructions are among the workplace skills these teenagers fail to demonstrate, according to employers. Martin Constantinides, director of ECM, a specialist recruitment firm which places numerate candidates in hi-tech companies, said it was becoming increasingly difficult to recruit people with good numeracy skills but \"it was ever thus\". The survey also highlighted a gap in careers advice. Mr Lambert said advisers were failing to relay to youngsters the \"exciting world that lies in science-related careers\". The school leavers are impressing recruiters with their IT skills, with 92% of employers saying they were pleased with their abilities in this area."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
