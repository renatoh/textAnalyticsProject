The national side have secured their place at the tournament in South Africa after winning their first eight qualifiers, but despite having played no part in any of those games \u2013 and having won just a single cap so far under Fabio Capello \u2013 Bent remains intent on capturing the England manager's attention. \"I can't do much more than I'm doing at the moment,\" said Bent, after scoring his sixth goal of the season during Sunderland's 5-2 home win over Wolverhampton Wanderers. \"Hopefully Capello is watching.\" Bent makes no secret of the fact he was crushed not to make the last World Cup and said we would be \"heartbroken\" to miss out this time around. His one opportunity under Capello to date came in last year's friendly win over Germany, when the striker was brought on as a half-time substitute but failed to make the desired impression. \"I went round the keeper and slipped over,\" said Bent. \"Things like that define your England career. If that goes in I could be in the next four or five squads - but it wasn't meant to be. \"You can't really be judged on 20 minutes here, 20 minutes there,\" Bent continued, and though he was speaking specifically about England, he might as well have been talking about his club situation. The striker has started every league game for Sunderland so far this season and only failed to score twice. That makes for a stark contrast with the end of last year, when his form dipped at Tottenham as he was increasingly restricted to coming off the bench. He was famously chastised during that period for missing a chance Harry Redknapp felt his \"missus\" could have put away against Portsmouth in January, and after joining Sunderland Bent admitted he had never felt supported by the Spurs manager. His new manager, Steve Bruce, can lose his temper, too, though, and was livid at the decision by Bent, having already scored one, to hand the ball to Kenwyne Jones when Sunderland won a second penalty against Wolves. \"No way,\" said Bent when asked if he would do the same thing again in a similar situation. \"I thought [Jones] had been playing really well without getting the goal he deserved. He said he fancied and I'd already had one so I said 'Have it'. But the gaffer had a go at me afterwards and when I was thinking about it, maybe I shouldn't have. If he hadn't scored I suppose the gaffer wouldn't have been happy.\" Jones was less apologetic, saying: \"I was confident I would score\", but both agreed the incident only proved how quickly they have developed an understanding up front. \"The fact Darren did give me the ball for the penalty shows that we are a very tight unit this season,\" said Jones. \"Whether we have won or lost, we have stuck together and we will need that if we want to take the club to the next level.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
