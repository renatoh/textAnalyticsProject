Social media use \u2013 including time on sites such as Reddit or Gawker Media that are built on blog platforms \u2013 accounted for nearly 17% of all time online, up from 12.2% a year ago, according to research commissioned by the Internet Advertising Bureau. Over the same period, the amount of time spent online on entertainment such as watching TV shows or YouTube videos and listening to music has almost halved from 22.1% to 12.4%. The shift appears to be in part driven by people spending more time on their mobiles, as on desktops entertainment accounts for 18% of time online compared to just 8% on smartphones and tablets such as the iPad. On mobile devices, social media accounts for more than 20% of time spent, compared to under 10% on desktop. Currently consumers spent 45% of their internet time on computers, 40% on mobiles and 15% tablets. Games are also more popular on mobile devices, with gaming on mobile devices accounting for 8.6% of time spent compared to 2.3% on desktop. Across all platforms, time spent on games rose from 3% to 6%. Though the amount of time spent consuming news on the web remains tiny \u2013 just two minutes and 15 seconds a day \u2013 the shift to mobile offers some encouragement for news organisations. News accounts for 4.4% of time spent on mobiles and tablets, compared to 2.2% of time on desktops. The research was conducted by UKOM and Comscore with a panel of 73,000 people with tracking software installed on their devices, as well as data from participating websites and services online. UKOM general manager Scott Fleming said: \u201cMobile internet time is more heavily skewed towards social networking and games, whilst desktop is more loaded towards email and entertainment such as film and multimedia. \u201cThe most effective digital ad strategies recognise and take into account how behaviour and mind-set differ dramatically by device.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
