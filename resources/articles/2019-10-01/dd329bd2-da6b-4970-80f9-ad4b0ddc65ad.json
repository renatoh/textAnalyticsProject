Hillary Clinton tweets parody of Trump Erdo\u011fan letter", "bodyText": "Donald Trump is known to many opponents as the troll in the Oval Office, but the woman he beat for the most powerful seat in the world seems to have learned something from his willingness to tweet provocative pictures and memes. On Sunday afternoon, Hillary Clinton tweeted a mocked-up letter from John F Kennedy to Nikita Khrushchev that was meant squarely to mock a real letter from Trump to Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan which was revealed to the public this week. \u201cFound in the archives,\u201d Clinton wrote, over an image of what purported to be a letter from the US president to the Soviet leader on 16 October 1962, during the Cuban missile crisis. \u201cDear Premier Khrushchev,\u201d the \u201cletter\u201d began. \u201cDon\u2019t be a dick, OK?\u201d Trump\u2019s letter to Erdogan, in which he urged the authoritarian Turkish president who has invaded northern Syria \u201cDon\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool!\u201d, met with widespread disbelief, not least for its strikingly unpresidential tone. \u201cTurkish presidential sources\u201d told the BBC Erdo\u011fan \u201creceived the letter, thoroughly rejected it and put it in the bin\u201d. A Russian government spokesman told reporters: \u201cYou don\u2019t often encounter such language in correspondence between heads of state.\u201d The letter was widely mocked and parodied \u2013 the image Clinton tweeted was included in a segment on Trump\u2019s letter by late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. But the Guardian\u2019s world affairs editor, Julian Borger, pointed out that like any presidential communication, Trump\u2019s letter to the Turkish president \u201cmay still end up at the National Archives alongside the writings of Washington, Lincoln and Roosevelt. The comparison will not be flattering.\u201d The spoof letter tweeted by Clinton continued: \u201cGet your missiles out of Cuba. Everybody will say, \u2018Yay, Khrushchev! You\u2019re the best!\u2019 But if you don\u2019t everybody will be like \u2018what an asshole\u2019 and call your garbage country \u2018The Soviet Bunion\u2019. \u201cYou\u2019re really busting my nuts here. Give you a jingle later. Hugs, John Fitzgerald Kennedy.\u201d For most of the weekend before Clinton\u2019s intervention, Trump was uncharacteristically restrained on Twitter. He remained at the White House rather than playing golf but his most impactful missives to his followers concerned his humiliating u-turn on hosting the next G7 summit at his own Florida golf club. Trump did not immediately respond to Clinton\u2019s tweet. Users did not have to look far, though, to see what might be on the way. In September 2017, Trump greeted the impending publication of Clinton\u2019s campaign memoir What Happened by tweeting a meme of the former first lady, senator and secretary of state being knocked over by a golf ball."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
