Tributes were paid to the prolific Jermain Defoe after he broke Stoke City\u2019s resistance with his equaliser in the fourth minute of stoppage time and Sam Allardyce could be seen delivering a theatrical performance for the fans who were making a racket in the away end, banging his chest with his fist as he marched towards the tunnel. Yet there was also a lingering sense of what might have been. While Sunderland had gripes about Marko Arnautovic\u2019s goal for Stoke, justifiably arguing it should have been disallowed for an apparent push by Peter Crouch on Youn\u00e8s Kaboul, and felt they should have had a penalty in the first half after a handball by Geoff Cameron, their complaints about the officials could not obscure the timidity that infected Allardyce\u2019s players for much of the match. The game was there to be won. Stoke had conceded 12 goals in their previous three matches and have not won since 19 March. Yet while Sunderland have a game in hand on Norwich City and Newcastle United, meaning they will stay up if they win their final three matches against Chelsea, Everton and Watford, they were weighed down by nerves against Stoke and slipped into the bottom three because of Crystal Palace\u2019s defeat at St James\u2019 Park. Having picked up eight points from their past four matches, momentum is swinging in Newcastle\u2019s direction. Sunderland host Chelsea on Saturday and Everton on 11 May, before finishing the season at Vicarage Road, and Allardyce was asked how he will ensure the pressure does not affect them again. \u201cWe talk about the last few games rather than this one,\u201d the manager said. \u201cGet back to that performance against Arsenal. Look at that performance, particularly in the second half, and try to emulate it on Saturday against Chelsea. We\u2019ll need to be at our very best against Chelsea to try to get the all-important win to take advantage of the game in hand we have over Newcastle. \u201cIn terms of the city, it\u2019s very close-knit and the fans are very close. They want to have contact with the players as much as they can. I don\u2019t see anything wrong with that. We\u2019re paid to take the pressure, so let\u2019s take it and play our best. Let\u2019s accept where we are and let the pressure bring the best out of us, so we can make everyone happy at the end of the season.\u201d Just as relevant as Sunderland\u2019s mentality were Allardyce\u2019s tactics. He has gradually made them harder to score against since replacing Dick Advocaat in October but they have drawn five of their past seven matches and failed to play with enough ambition or guile. They have been too reliant on Defoe, who needs more support. He won and scored the penalty that saved a point after he was fouled by Cameron. Allardyce was told that it was the 11th away game in which the striker has scored since joining in January 2015. \u201cIs it really?\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a great stat, ain\u2019t it, that? I wish we were playing away next week then! Maybe that\u2019s because he finds a little bit more space because the opposition have to attack you more, maybe that\u2019s the case. We counter-attack and he gets that bit more space and takes full advantage of it. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to thank him for the 14 goals because without them, I think we would already be relegated. We\u2019ve tightened up the defensive side of our game to give opportunities to the players who score.\u201d Yet Newcastle have also improved under Rafael Ben\u00edtez and they will expect to beat Aston Villa on Saturday. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised because they\u2019ve spent a huge amount of money and have got a lot of quality players \u2013 and they\u2019ve had a bit of fortune today, whereas we didn\u2019t have any good fortune today with the refereeing decisions,\u201d Allardyce said. \u201cThey had good fortune in that Crystal Palace missed a penalty. We could have been in a lot better position had Palace scored. We can\u2019t control that. What we can control is our own destiny, which has first got to be beat Chelsea, then take advantage of the extra game.\u201d Man of the match Jermain Defoe (Sunderland)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
