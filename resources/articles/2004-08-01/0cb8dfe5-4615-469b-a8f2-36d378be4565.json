Backed from 100-1 down to 8-1, Exponential was close up until quickening to lead over a furlong from home and he was then driven out by Allan to score by a length from Starduster. One on-course punter had \u00a350 on to win \u00a35,000. Leading High Street bookmakers Ladbrokes reported losing around \u00a3160,000 on the race. \"We laid four bets of \u00a3100 each-way at 100-1, but spare a thought for the punter who had \u00a3100 each-way at SP and as such has lost out on close to \u00a310,000,\" said Balthazar Fabricius, of Ladbrokes. \"The early birds who took the price certainly got the worm. This is the biggest winning market mover on a single day's trade we can remember,\" he added. Exponential had finished last of 13 on his debut at Beverley but Williams said: \"He had been working well before that run, but he is a bit tricky and it was all too much for him.\" Apprentice Andrew Mullen celebrated the news that he is to join Kevin Ryan when teaming up with the Malton trainer to win the nursery on Coleorton Dancer. Mullen brought his mount, the 5-4 favourite, with a strong late burst to lead inside the final furlong and burst clear to beat On The Waterline by 3 lengths."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
