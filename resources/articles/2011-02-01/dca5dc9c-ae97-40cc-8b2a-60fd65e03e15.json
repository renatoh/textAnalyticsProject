The communities secretary's staff were forced to correct a press release containing the errant figure \u2013 more than double the real increase in council chief executive pay of 34% \u2013 which he also cited on Radio 4's Today programme. He made the mistake while announcing plans for councillors to vet all salaries over \u00a3100,000 and to block those that seem excessive. Pickles said he wanted to \"democracy-proof\" local authority pay. The localism bill going through parliament instructs councils to hold a full meeting to scrutinise their executives' pay deals. Pickles said he would recommend that all pay above \u00a3100,000 is given such treatment. Research this week revealed that 220 council employees earn more than the prime minister's basic salary of \u00a3142,500. Pickles claimed that chief executive pay had risen by 78% between 2002 and 2007, misquoting a report by the local government watchdog, the Audit Commission. The report in fact said that chief executive pay in the private sector FTSE 250 had risen by 78% \u2013 more than double the 34% increase in councils between 2002 and 2008. The communities secretary has been a persistent and vocal critic of what he sees as excessive pay at the top of councils. The commission's report found that the median salary of executives in the biggest councils was \u00a3150,000 in 2007-08, less than university vice-chancellors, and trailing behind chief executives in the private sector, where basic salaries were around \u00a3400,000, topped up with bonuses of a further \u00a3586,000. A spokesperson for Pickles said the error did not detract from thrust of his argument. There was, he said, a \"long history of issues\" with chief executive pay. He added: \"A couple of words got cut out. There was a mistake and we have now corrected it.\" All senior salaries are published, usually approved in council committees and by the full council when the annual budget is passed. Under the changes, appointments paying more than \u00a3100,000 a year will require a public vote by councillors. The Local Government Association called the decision \"unnecessary and top-down\" and called for the same mechanism to apply to Whitehall civil servants, with a vote in parliament \u2013 something Pickles did not rule out. He told the Today programme: \"This is just part of the checks and balances so that it allows every councillor to consciously make a decision with regard to senior pay. It just seems to me to be a reasonable thing to do.\" Asked about the LGA's call for senior civil servants' salaries to be debated by MPs, Pickles said: \"I don't see any reason why we shouldn't have this kind of debate in the House of Commons.\" However, he ruled out applying the new rules to headteachers, saying their salaries were for schools to decide. Along with basic salaries, councillors will have to approve bonuses, pension payments and other perks. Sir Steve Bullock, who chairs the LGA's local government group workforce board, said: \"It is right that pay for senior staff in the public sector is subject to scrutiny, but this kind of top-down interference is simply unnecessary. \"Councils are leading the way in being transparent about all their spending, and many authorities already have remuneration committees with independent members from outside the authority that examine senior salaries. \"We look forward to hearing from ministers whether other parts of the public sector are going to be as transparent as local government, and if MPs will be asked to approve the salaries of civil servants earning more than \u00a3100,000.\" Caroline Flint, the shadow communities secretary, said that councils should publish low pay as well as high pay to expose exploitation. A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said low pay was being addressed in a separate review."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
