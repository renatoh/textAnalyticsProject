In Denmark yesterday most thoughts were already on Germany. This evening's friendly in Copenhagen feels like the start of the preparations for the World Cup finals, if it is not hubristic to count on England's qualification. Sven-Goran Eriksson will find himself giving team talks to the nation as well as to his footballers. Like all his predecessors since Sir Alf Ramsey, he has to persuade the public that a history of under-achievement can be brought to a close. The failures can be made to look better if you only view them from a sufficiently oblique angle. Defeats under Eriksson in the quarter-finals of both the 2002 World Cup and Euro 2004 can be treated as an invaluable grounding. \"This team is the best we have had since I came 4\u00bd years ago,\" he said, \"and in that period we have played two tournaments.\" Eriksson was busy declaring his pervasive contentment yesterday, speaking of his happy working relationship with the FA chief executive Brian Barwick. Indeed, the Swede very nearly pledged to see out a contract that runs till 2008. He is a manager who has grown slick in marshalling his arguments, claiming a four-week gap to rest and prepare for the 2006 World Cup will make all the difference to the players. For generations fans have heard England managers promise their era will be different, but it is the duty of anyone in Eriksson's post to foster faith. \"The squad is more experienced and it is the right age,\" he said irrefutably. Eriksson is no orator, however, and the Swede knows that his minimalist persona can cause frustration. Robbie Fowler, last capped in 2002, has accused the manager of a dullness that deflates and dooms the national team. David Beckham had to mount one of those defences of Eriksson that seem to be demanded periodically. \"We believe we've got the right man for the job,\" the England captain said. \"The fans and everyone in the country have to have faith in him.\" Eriksson himself never pretends to be a firebrand and reflected that the last occasion he shouted was \"maybe at home\". He ought to be able to fall back on his solid record in the current qualification group, particularly since Morten Olsen's Denmark are at far greater risk of missing out on the World Cup finals. For Eriksson, an appearance in Germany is taken for granted and a nation wants to be persuaded that England will excel there. Beckham is already convinced . \"Sir Alex Ferguson,\" he recalled, \"used to say that if you look around the dressing room and see players you trust then you're on a winner. I believe we've got that now.\" Refraining from any pledge of glory, he still talks of a \"special\" World Cup for England and contends that other nations share his appraisal. \"The young talent we have is exceptional. Even players in Brazil and France are commenting on some of the players that we have in our team.\" Cynics might argue that this amounts to no more than another allusion to Wayne Rooney. Even so, Beckham is on solid ground in noting that Stamford Bridge and Anfield can now provide England with men associated with success to put beside the old guard from Old Trafford and Highbury. \"It is always important for team spirit to have players who have won European Cups and the Premiership,\" said Beckham. \"You can see the excitement when you come into the squad. The calibre of managers in the Premiership - with Jose Mourinho, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, Sir Alex Ferguson and others - is bringing young players on.\" With so many team-mates in possession of shiny new medals, he might not wish to dwell on his own pair of trophy-less years at Real Madrid. \"In two seasons I've had four managers,\" Beckham said. \"It's never happened in my career before.\" The incumbent Vanderlei Luxemburgo may have staying power but, alarmingly for England, he offers only occasional employment to Michael Owen. \"Even last season when he didn't play so many games he still looked the sharpest I've seen in a long time,\" Beckham argued. \"It's his decision, but I hope he stays at Real Madrid.\" Although Eriksson was just as happy with the striker's form last season, he felt compelled to remark, \"I don't think he is happy.\" Owen's situation can be disregarded this evening. Since he is suspended from next month's qualifier with Wales, Jermain Defoe will start. Eriksson will otherwise field his strongest line-up, who have not appeared together since the defeat of Azerbaijan five months ago. He will, however, make half a dozen substitutions, with Paul Robinson, just recovered from a knee problem, to be replaced at the interval. Another knee injury saw Shaun Wright-Phillips leave yesterday and fly home for treatment at Stamford Bridge. A large and accomplished group is developing at Chelsea, moving the England manager to reassure Joe Cole that his prominent role will not be under threat even if he is sometimes sidelined by Mourinho. Eriksson believes that such victims of squad rotation will be nicely rested next summer. For the England manager, this is the year of thinking positively."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
