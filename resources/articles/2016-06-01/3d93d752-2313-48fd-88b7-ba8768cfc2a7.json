They reveal a near-constant stream of despair, privation and self-harm. On some days, there are six \u201ccode blues\u201d (medical emergencies) for suicide attempts. Some asylum seekers attempted suicide day after day after day. They are placed on high watch for a time but then try to kill themselves almost immediately after their watch is ended. The reports also reveal that it is sometimes months \u2013 after people have been moved to Australia for a medical emergency \u2013 before they feel safe enough to reveal the sexual or physical abuse of their children. These incident reports published below represent a tiny proportion of those that occurred on Nauru and Manus during Stevenson\u2019s time on the islands. The names of staff have been redacted and asylum seekers and refugees have been given single-letter pseudonyms, where necessary, to protect their identities. Some detailed locations have also been redacted. They are otherwise unamended. Warning: some of the material published below may be upsetting for some readers. 1. \u2018The cuts ranged from superficial to deep\u2019 26/09/2014 7:50:00 AM Ref: 1084910 Incident type: Self harm Incident category: Critical Reported by: [REDACTED] Agency/provider: Transfield Security Location: [REDACTED] Description: On this day I was posted as W3.1 with CSO [REDACTED]. I responded to a code blue call in [REDACTED], arriving at this location at approximately 0749hrs. On arrival I found four male asylum seekers with a range of cuts to their inner forearms. The cuts ranged from superficial to deep. I identified all four asylum seekers to be unaccompanied minors (UAMs). First aid was offered to all four UAMs involved by CSOs [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] and this was declined. My attention was then drawn to a disturbance in [REDACTED]. Upon entering this tent, I witnessed approximately two UAMs attempting to destroy property and tents. At approximately 0750hrs, I called an emergency code black (officer needing assistance) via my radio. ERT members and more CSOs arrived to contain the situation. It was at this time I observed a further two UAMs with superficial cuts to their forearms. IHMS arrived onsite at 0752hrs. CSO [REDACTED] approached me and gave me a single blade with what appeared to be blood on it, isolated in a plastic bag. I held onto this blade. The situation in area 10 was deemed to be under control and at approximately 0827hrs IHMS were given access to the UAM area to treat the six UAMs with cuts. The six UAMs remained onside in the IHMS tent after treatment from IHMS. They have accepted an offer to be moved to [REDACTED] to see mental health. I then moved to [REDACTED] with the isolated blade and completed this incident report. I had no further involvement. 2. \u2018I will walk into the ocean with my daughter\u2019 20/01/2015 2:10:00 PM Ref: 1321634 Incident type: Self harm threat Incident category: Minor Reported by: [REDACTED] Agency/provider: Transfield Services Location: [REDACTED] Description: At approximately 1410hrs, CSPW [REDACTED] met with A to discuss tent moves.

A then tried to swallow two screws approximately 1.5 inches long. CSO [REDACTED] managed to remove the screws from A\u2019s hands. A\u2019s daughter B advised CSO [REDACTED] that A had already swallowed two of the same screws. CSO [REDACTED] then asked A if she had swallowed them and A said \u201cyes she has\u201d. A also stated words to the effect of \u201cit\u2019s too late it\u2019s over\u201d.

CW [REDACTED] was also present. C then disclosed that E did something \u2018stupid\u2019. E then disclosed the following: Approximately four days ago (Monday 22/03/2015) she stated that she was \u201cfeeling upset and worried as she missed her husband who lived in the community in Australia\u201d. She stated that she \u201cwanted a tattoo of his name but can\u2019t get that here so I cut his name on my chest. In a discussion about what she was feeling when she did this, E stated that when she feels worried or sad she cuts herself, then has a shower and the pain she experiences when the cut gets wet \u201creleases the feelings in my heart and I feel better\u201d. E then pulled down her t-shirt and her husband\u2019s name was observed cut into her skin on the top of her left breast. It appears to be approximately 8cm to 10cm in length and 2cm high with six letters. (CW was unable to recall the exact name). E advised that she did not wish to tell CW what she cut herself with as they would take it away or place her on watch. E then showed the CW\u2019s her left inner forearm where there were approximately five-six scars approximately 2cm to 4cm in length horizontally across her arm. E was crying during this conversation however she advised that she just became upset when she spoke about her husband.

If he didn\u2019t receive news about this soon he would jump. At approximately 1815hrs G approached [REDACTED] and demanded to get through to speak to his cousin. As he was emotional and proved to be detrimental to the situation he was denied access to Bravo camp. At approximately 1825hrs G presented to [REDACTED] with lacerations to his stomach.

K informed [REDACTED] that her husband J had reported approximately 4 months ago to her that he had been in a car with their three year old son, L, and two Nauruan Wilson\u2019s Security Officers. Their son L had said to K that one Nauruan Officer had put his hand up L\u2019s shorts and was \u201cplaying with his bottom\u201d. K removed L from the middle of the car and placed K on his lap but did not say anything as he feared the two Nauruan Officers in the car. J informed CSPW [REDACTED] that she had reported this to Immigration Officers in Brisbane when she was recently medivacked (within the past two weeks). During the same conversation, J informed CSPW [REDACTED] that approximately 5 months ago a Nauruan Officer had run his hand down the back of J\u2019s head and head scarf and said to her \u201cif there is anything you want on the outside let me know, I can get you anything\u201d.

A search of RPC3 was conducted to ensure that she was not already on site. At approximately 1840hrs CSO 1 [REDACTED] notified the NPF and advised them that M had not returned from open centre. CSO 1 [REDACTED] gave the Nauru police force the personal details of M including a description of what she was wearing which was provided to CSO 1 [REDACTED] from her brother N. Shortly after this N was accompanied by his mother O at [REDACTED] and both became very upset and distraught. N and O were moved into the gate house so their actions would not impede on IHMS. At approximately 2107hrs the security control room notified CSO 1 [REDACTED] that [REDACTED] from Connect had advised them that she witnessed the Nauruan police force (NPF) pick up the asylum seeker. The location of this was not given. CSO 1 [REDACTED] called the NPF to confirm this and was told that police had picked up a naked female refugee and were bringing her back to the police station. The NPF also stated that they could not determine at this stage if it was M or not, due to her not having any clothes on. At approximately 2120hrs CSO 1 [REDACTED] received a phone call from [REDACTED] advising him that she was at the police station with M and was requesting an interpreter to assist the police interview. CSO 2 [REDACTED] and CSO 3 [REDACTED] departed RPC3 to the police station via RPC1 to pick up the Farsi interpreter.

CSO 1 [REDACTED] was informed by the security control room that O had permission to be with her daughter. CSO 1 [REDACTED] relayed this message to both N and O. N became very upset and appeared very stressed that he could not go with his mother and asked permission to go. CSO 1 [REDACTED] then notified [REDACTED] from the Department of Immigration and Border Protection (DIBP) duty phone and asked permission for N to attend and then told him that he and his mother can remain together in the gate house until approval has been given. At approximately 2310hrs M arrived at the RON hospital under NPF escort for a medical examination. It was at this time CSO 1 [REDACTED] was getting information from the security control room stating that she was refusing medical treatment and did not want to see her mother or brother. At approximately 0050hrs, 17 May 2015, permission was sought and approved from DIBP to house N and O in the managed accommodation area away from RPC3 while the incident was still in progress. M was released from the RON hospital at approximately 0150hrs and arrived at RPC1 IHMS for follow up medical at around 0210hrs and was placed on a high watch. 8. \u2018I no have friends, I won\u2019t be needing a room, a bed any food or water.
