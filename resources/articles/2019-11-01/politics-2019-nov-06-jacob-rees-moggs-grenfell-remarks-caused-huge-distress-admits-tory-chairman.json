Rees-Mogg sparked widespread uproar after claiming the Grenfell Tower fire victims did not use \u201ccommon sense\u201d when they followed fire service advice to stay put in the burning building. The leader of the House of Commons issued a \u201cprofound apology\u201d after he told a radio interviewer: \u201cI think if either of us were in a fire, whatever the fire brigade said, we would leave the burning building. It just seems the common-sense thing to do.\u201d Cleverly was asked on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cIsn\u2019t the reality that [Rees-Mogg] has no idea how these people live? He has no idea how people who didn\u2019t go to Eton, didn\u2019t go to Oxford, didn\u2019t inherit large sums of money really live their lives?\u201d Cleverly said Rees-Mogg\u2019s comments were hurtful and it was right for him to have apologised. \u201cJacob recognises that what he said was wrong and caused a huge amount of hurt and distress,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has apologised unreservedly and I do think that is the right thing for him to do.\u201d He told Today that no one could \u201ccredibly\u201d know what decisions those trapped in the tower faced that evening. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone could think through the circumstances or the decisions we would make,\u201d he added. The Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen has also apologised after initially defending Rees-Mogg, suggesting the Commons leader was cleverer than those who died in the fire. Asked whether the cabinet minister meant to say he would have left the flats against official advice, Bridgen said: \u201cYes, that\u2019s what he meant to say.\u201d The BBC\u2019s Evan Davis responded: \u201cBut in a way that is exactly what people object to, because he is in effect saying \u2018I wouldn\u2019t have died because I would have been cleverer than the people who took the fire brigade\u2019s advice.\u2019\u201d Rees-Mogg\u2019s remarks came on a difficult day for the Conservatives on the eve of their election campaign launch. Earlier it was revealed that one Tory candidate, Francesca O\u2019Brien, had written on Facebook that people on the reality TV show Benefits Street needed \u201cputting down\u201d. When asked about O\u2019Brien\u2019s comments, Cleverly said they were \u201cunacceptable\u201d but suggested she would not be sacked as a Tory candidate. \u201cThis is a comment which the candidate themselves recognises was unacceptable. It\u2019s the nature often on social media that people say things without really thinking through their position,\u201d he said. Boris Johnson formally launched his election campaign with a blistering attack on Jeremy Corbyn, likening the Labour leader to Stalin. The prime minister told the Daily Telegraph that Corbyn would raise taxes so significantly that Labour would end up destroying the basis of the country\u2019s prosperity. The Labour party under Corbyn \u201cpoint their fingers at individuals with a relish and a vindictiveness not seen since Stalin persecuted the kulaks\u201d, Johnson added. Corbyn quickly rubbished the claims on Twitter. In his interview on Radio 4, Cleverly said no deal remained the \u201cdefault setting\u201d in forthcoming trade talks with the EU, as far as the government was concerned. \u201cUltimately, the default setting has always been no deal. That is not what we want,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cThe prime minister has demonstrated, as have the EU, that, when you are focused and both trying to get a good outcome, it can be done.\u201d He also defended a Tory campaign video that critics said had been \u201cdoctored\u201d. The film depicts the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, struggling to answer a question on TV about his party\u2019s position on leaving the EU. Cleverly told the BBC that Tory social media feeds had posted the interview in full and then followed it up with a \u201clighthearted satirical\u201d video on Labour\u2019s Brexit position. \u201cWhat we also did, and this is not unique to us, is we did a lighthearted satirical video, obviously so with a comedy soundtrack, highlighting the Labour party\u2019s chaotic position on Brexit,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
