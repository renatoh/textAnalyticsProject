Any time I\u2019m on home soil, I can\u2019t lose.\u201d Joshua also revealed that a health issue that required an operation left him \u201ctired\u201d and \u201cdrained\u201d in the buildup to his shock defeat against Ruiz in June \u2013 and that it was so troublesome he had to put a bucket of ice on his head before his ring walk at Madison Square Garden. \u201cI had some issue with my health which I was going through for a long time,\u201d Joshua admitted. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what was wrong with me. I felt so tired and drained and thought it must be down to training. In the changing room before the fight I got a bucket of ice and was putting my head in it thinking: \u2018Why do I feel so tired?\u2019\u201d The 30-year-old did not reveal what the problem was but said it was diagnosed after a checkup following the Ruiz fight and quickly dealt with. \u201cEven in this camp I had an operation done but as I\u2019d started training in June I had no issues. The responsibilities of being world champion are difficult. All that stuff, feeling so tired, dealing with obligations. Now I have energy, I haven\u2019t missed a session.\u201d The Briton intends to start light training for his second reign as heavyweight champion before Christmas, after pledging to keep learning \u201cthe sweet science\u201d \u2013 while his promoter, Eddie Hearn, plans to nail down an opponent and venue quickly for what will be Joshua\u2019s first contest in the UK since defeating the Russian Alexander Povetkin in September 2018. \u201cWembley doesn\u2019t look great, date-wise,\u201d said Hearn. \u201cTottenham Hotspur is a nice new stadium for a UK fight. We\u2019ve got to look at it. I think the phone has gone crazy and it\u2019s like, \u2018Bring him here, bring him here.\u2019 They\u2019ve seen what we\u2019ve done here and there\u2019s a lot of options internationally but he does want to box back in the UK. \u201cWe spoke to Spurs about hosting this fight, which they were keen to do, but unfortunately the dates didn\u2019t work out. They would be keen to do it and it would be a nice stadium to do it in London.\u201d Joshua, meanwhile, insists a homecoming fight would be \u201cmega\u201d and he is unconcerned whom he meets next. \u201cThere\u2019s still a big interest in the heavyweight division, especially now we are taking the belts back,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes it would be better against a Brit but, if not, I follow the mandatories and defend them that way.\u201d The 38-year-old Pulev has won 28 of his 29 fights \u2013 with his one defeat coming against Wladimir Klitschko in 2014 \u2013 but his ponderous violence would appear to be a ready\u2011made opponent for Joshua. Joshua insists, though, that he will take no one for granted. \u201cI\u2019m always going to have to prove myself, aren\u2019t I? That\u2019s the name of the game. Over the next three to six months I\u2019m going to have to do it again. It\u2019s no good winning this time and losing next time, saying: \u2018Look, I won six months ago, let\u2019s look at that.\u2019 Even though I\u2019ve proved it to myself, I\u2019m going to have to prove it to you guys once again. I can\u2019t get too comfortable. \u201cI felt like we upped our game preparing for Ruiz this time. We were doing longer rounds, we brought in a lot more sparring partners, I kept my mind thinking, challenging myself.Even in the fight on Saturday there were challenges, even if not physically. Mentally staying switched on was really challenging. And it worked really well.\u201d Joshua had talked about going back to school after his seventh-round defeat at Madison Square Garden against Ruiz and he proved as good as his word, repeatedly jabbing and moving to win a wide points victory over the Mexican-American. Afterwards, when asked if he had ever felt better in a ring, he replied: \u201cNo, I felt good. I\u2019m getting more and more experienced, understanding myself, and that\u2019s a good thing. Even though I took my loss, I didn\u2019t lose heart. I\u2019m back again, I\u2019m learning. And we\u2019re going to get back into the gym. I\u2019m going to go to Sheffield early and just keep practising my skills.\u201d Joshua also expressed his sympathy for Ruiz, who confessed afterwards that he had spent three months partying, eating and not training after becoming world champion. When asked if he could empathise, Joshua said: \u201cYeah, I did it. Everyone does it. The belts can be your best friend or your best enemy. It just depends on you as a person. It\u2019s hard to say no. Even though I gave Andy the belts at the weigh-in, it\u2019s hard being champion. Trust me. It\u2019s not all fun. I remember when Tyson said: \u2018You couldn\u2019t walk in my shoes.\u2019 It\u2019s not what it seems like, this life of dedication. It\u2019s a fucking headache.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
