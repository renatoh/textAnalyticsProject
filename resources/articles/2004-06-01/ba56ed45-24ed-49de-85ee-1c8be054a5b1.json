Now comes the serious business: \"the emotion, the tension, the fight,\" as Iv\u00e1n Helguera puts it. The real work starts here, at the \"Casa de Espa\u00f1a\" in the green rolling hills not far from Oporto. Helguera is looking forward to it, yet he could not say the same on Sunday morning. From a six-day concentraci\u00f3n in Madrid, to Getafe, to Santiago de Compostela, to Portugal in a day, the selecci\u00f3n took a circuitous route to get to their Euro 2004 base camp, taking two flights instead of one. It was not the most appealing of journeys for a notoriously poor flier. \"It is getting better bit by bit and I tend to sit in the cockpit when I can, which helps a little,\" Helguera admits, \"but I don't like flying. \"And I think I probably get more tired than my team-mates on trips by plane because I'm so tense when I travel. But, although I don't enjoy flying at all, I've never gone so far as Dennis Bergkamp and refused to travel - even though Portugal is well within driving distance. \"We're really looking forward to Saturday night now and I think our preparation has been good. Although we've started the serious work in Portugal, the time in Madrid was every bit as important for us; it brought us together, helped us get to know each other better in a relaxed atmosphere. The aim in Madrid was mainly just to return to feeling 100% after a really tough season, and to do that together, to relax as a team.\" The experience was not so positive for everyone, however. Helguera's Real Madrid team-mate M\u00edchel Salgado suffered a thigh injury in training that forced him to pull out of the squad. \"I took the news really, really badly,\" Helguera admits. \"M\u00edchel is a great friend of mine, the person I get on with best in the national team and it was really sad to see him leave. Especially as I knew how much he was looking forward to the European Championship. M\u00edchel had such a tremendous, burning desire to play in Portugal, and now look. It really isn't fair. I felt terrible for him. \"We'll miss him. He gives you real confidence, because you know he'll do anything to win. It's best not to dwell on that too much now, though. I just hope M\u00edchel gets fit as soon as possible and keeps his spirit up. \"M\u00edchel apart, things have gone well, though. We beat Andorra 4-0 in Getafe in our last friendly before the tournament. Not that the result was really important. Those kinds of games really act mainly as an opportunity for the coach to try things out - to see which partnerships he can go for at centre-back, in the middle of midfield and up front. I\u00f1aki S\u00e1ez likes to look at players in twos - that's why he changed almost the whole team at half-time. \"For us, though, friendlies at that stage are extended training sessions more than anything else, the chance to get ourselves that little bit sharper. \"There was a sense in the press that the players who started the match, myself included, are going to be the starting XI, but as a player you should never, ever think of yourself as a guaranteed starter. \"It's far better to fight for that place every day. You have to feel like you have earned it and, if you're fighting for it, that makes you better prepared mentally and physically. It's important to know that the manager always calls on you but, when it comes to life-or-death games, that simply doesn't apply - if there's someone better than you, he'll play. And rightly so.\" An industrial satellite town just south of Madrid, with a stadium that barely holds 15,000, appeared an odd location for Spain's final friendly. Helguera emerged from the showers into the madness of Getafe's crammed little mixed zone, with screaming fans clambering over walls and hanging off ledges above, but he insists that it was a good choice. \"The selecci\u00f3n needs to reach everyone, everywhere - from the greatest stadiums to the most modest ones. It wouldn't be fair for only the biggest grounds, where the big clubs play, to have the chance to host a team that is supposed to be everyone's team. We're Spain and those fans who have very few opportunities to be near us have to be given a chance, too. Besides, I enjoyed it. \"The following morning we had a day in Santiago de Compostela - the shrine of St James, the final destination of the famous pilgrimage. It was hectic and, yes, it meant an extra flight, but it was lovely. All those kinds of off-field commitments, like meeting the pop group Caf\u00e9 Quijano a few days before, take some of the pressure off and, if they help to attract the fans, encouraging them to get right behind us from the start, then perfect. \"But Santiago was more than that, really, genuinely special. I had never had the chance to go there before because whenever I'd had holidays I tried to wind down, but I know lots of people who had been and they all spoke wonders. They were right. What little time we had there was marvellous. \"As I kissed Santiago I couldn't help letting slip a few wishes that were flying round in my head. And, yes, of course that included asking him to make Spain European champions.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
