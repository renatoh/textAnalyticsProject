To be chart eligible, you can't give away free gifts with a CD single, for example. And options for B-sides and remixes are limited: basic neutering measures obstructing anything approaching \"value for money\" for the consumer are partly responsible for killing off the CD single as a viable format. In 2009, there is still a distant hope that it might somehow one day \"all be about the music\" again, a hope so desperate that it makes major labels' attempts to embrace Spotify (only a decade after Napster) look forward-thinking. Applying some sense of equality to the pop charts is all very noble (and, like all noble things, quite boring) but the problem at the heart of it all is this: you cannot create a level playing field when one song has a marketing budget that's five times that of another. This comes to mind in light of one campaign from the last 18 months, aimed at launching a UK artist whose debut single \u2013 video costs excluded \u2013 was propelled into the top three by a marketing budget so unusually grotesque that it is not fit to reproduce in a family newspaper. Much was spent on buying up regional radio ad slots, then \u2013 when regional radio mysteriously started playing the song in question \u2013 taking news of this airplay to a previously reluctant Radio 1, saying, \"How do you like them onions?\" (Or similar). If you look at the subsequent chart position, it was all a roaring success, but it's one of those hits that doesn't really feel like a hit at all. Actual hit records take on a life of their own; they're not hooked up to a life support machine with occasional shocks to keep the heart pumping. La Roux's In For The Kill, on the other hand, is an actual hit record; its success, and the public's positive reaction to its success, and therefore its continued success, was all genuine. For a single with such strong 80s stylings it was perhaps fitting that its slow, steady ascent to the top three felt like something from 25 years ago. Anyway, here's our proposal. The Official Charts Company needs a system of weighting the charts so that hit singles \u2013 proper hit singles \u2013 are properly listed. If two songs each sell 1,000 downloads (or are streamed 1,000 times), the song whose video costs \u00a35,000 should chart higher than the song whose video cost \u00a340,000. It'll be a complicated algorithm but they'll get there eventually. But it'll be strict. Oh, by God, it'll be strict. Songwriting talent? If it's genetic it's not really your own: INSTANT CHART DEMOTION. Nor will it any longer be helpful to be good looking, to be well dressed, or to give interesting interviews. It'll shake things up, but it'll make things marginally easier for (Big finish confiscated as evidence by The Obvious And Laboriously Signposted Peter Andre Joke Police pending further investigation)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
