Around the same time as those events in America, 34 people were killed in flash floods in Brazil, and 300 in a shop fire in Peru - for most types of natural or man-made incidents like this, our emergency procedures stand good. But the dimension of international terrorism did set off a lot of specific reviews in the UK about how to deal with large-scale destruction and fatalities, and many other areas. With something very big in London, our response and resources would be put to the test. There is a mobilisation plan for officers in London to support each other, and there's also a national aid protocol. But what if it's a multi-seated incident? That gets you into the question of resilience - having the numbers of police and fire officers and resources not only to tackle the event but to sustain a recovery process week after week. There have been teams reviewing that for us and many other agencies around the country. It's no secret that the government's given a lot of funding for the fire service to expand its mass decontamination role, or that we're looking at mass evacuation of people from parts of London if needs be. It's not really new, when you think of it. My grandmother moved from the east end of London to Windsor almost overnight during the war after a government letter came through the door saying, pack up. She was there for a year. Nowadays, if anyone asks, could we manage the consequences of a 9/11 attack, the emergency services are fairly confident they could. In the UK, we define a major incident as any emergency that requires one or all of the main emergency services to implement special measures. When one of those services declares that an occurrence is a major incident, it gets everyone thinking along the same lines. Each service knows what its role is - emergency services, the British Transport Police, the military, local authorities, the health authorities, Port of London Authority, Marine Coastguard. All this is set out in protocols published as a major-incident manual by the London Emergency Services Liaison Panel (LESLP). Our police unit is responsible for coordinating this working group. An updated manual is about to be published. We adopt the \"all hazards\" approach: rather than having a contingency blueprint for each incident, the protocols can be laid on any incident in London. These instructions are frequently reviewed, in light of what we learn from major incidents. They were originally issued a decade ago (1993) through collaboration between the British Transport Police, City of London Police, the fire and ambulance services, and the local authorities, all coming together under the banner of the liaison panel. The panel meets every three months to discuss policy, debrief incidents, carry out exercises and generally make sure our approach is cohesive. If an incident occurs we come together as often as twice a day to represent our respective agencies. The group can also draw on the expertise of other agencies in a major incident scenario. Every incident is different but several features are similar: destruction, damage, public impact, injury, disruption, death. You can generally break down a typical incident into four stages. There's the initial response, which some people call the \"chaos stage\", when the emergency services have been alerted and are on their way to the scene. In the consolidation phase, we actually find out what we're dealing with. Police officers are using an established system to assess the scene by quickly finding out the most important information - like the exact location, numbers of casualties and what injuries they have. They feed this information back to their control rooms. Then they find out what emergency services are required, what hazards are at the scene, and the best way for the services to get there. The recovery period, when we gain control of the situation, usually signals the end of potential danger. All casualties are being treated or removed hospital and we're now dealing, or preparing to deal, with recovery and identification of the dead. Fourth comes the return to normality. This can actually be one of the most difficult stages and can take varying lengths of time, depending on what service you represent. Police officers may have to secure an area for days, weeks or months; investigations can continue for a long time. For the victims and their families, their lives may never be the same. One of our jobs in a major incident is to establish safe zones around the incident, to secure the scene and preserve it for investigation. We call these the inner and outer cordons. The police control who enters and who leaves the scene. At the same time, they're preventing crime, and introducing measures to return things to normality. Inside the inner cordon, the fire service is responsible for safety. Gold, silver, bronze But probably the most important police role in a major incident is coordination between all the emergency services. The supervising officer has to manage the situation during the very early stages, and may have to make difficult decisions. In a major incident what you need is for all the representatives of the emergency services to meet early, to discuss the way forward. Managing the scene also means setting up rendezvous points as early as possible for briefings between emergency services, as well as cordoned secure areas, and marshalling areas for emergency equipment. Just putting up a cordon around the scene is more complicated than it sounds. If it's in a residential area, what happens to the local people? If they need to be evacuated, that can be difficult if they're elderly or disabled or children, or diverse communities. There's also traffic flow to consider, and the setting up of an outer cordon to protect the inner cordon. Local authorities have a big role to play in assisting evacuation and providing shelter and accommodation for displaced residents. The next priority is to set up a joint emergency services control centre, to coordinate all communications. Later on, we may need to take non-emergency services personnel into the affected scene, such as structural surveyors and electricity, water or gas experts. This access also has to be controlled. Finally, there is the identification of the deceased. This is partly done through a system known as the casualty bureau where we collate information from concerned relatives or friends about people who might be missing, to compare with lists at hospitals and survivor reception centres and, later, to the deceased that are recovered. Decisions on identification will be agreed by an identification commission chaired by HM Coroner consisting of the pathologist, ante and postmortem staff, and the senior identification manager - a senior police officer with overall responsibility for casualty bureau, recovery of deceased,family liaison and all issues relating to identification This is the group that decides the criteria and methods of identification, and it's the only group with authority to relay the identities of deceased to next of kin. Such a mammoth management task needs a watertight system of control. The one Britain has arrived at breaks the management team within each emergency service into three roles: gold, silver, bronze. Gold is the senior officer representing each emergency service, who lays down the strategy for managing the incident. Silver are the people responsible for implementing this strategy and developing tactics through the efforts of a third group, the bronze level personnel. Bronze are the operational officers from each service responsible for actually deploying resources on the ground. The benefit of this structure is that it allows the emergency services to follow a system of command and control with established roles and responsibilities. To help with strategy and tactics in an incident, the Gold and Silver groups can also draw in senior people from outside the emergency services for their specific expertise, such as rail or airline officials. During a major incident each of these groups could be meeting as often as hourly. The Gold coordination group will normally meet at a venue away from the scene. These meetings are chaired by the police, and all decisions have to be justified and recorded, to help with any later inquiries into the incident, as well as debriefs and reviews. The Silver coordination group, also chaired by the police, meets at the scene as early as possible, to discuss how to tackle the incident. It remains stationed at or near the scene. It's very important at this level to have people who are really empowered by their organisations to make decisions; there's no time to go away to ask somebody else for a piece of information. That said, at the early stages of an incident, the Silvers may be very junior officers, if they are the first on the scene. Later, more senior officers relieve them. The Bronzes, meanwhile, are at the scene throughout, carrying out instructions. For the police service, an investigation also begins from the outset. If we're attending a train crash we need to consider all the possible causes, ranging from accident to terrorism. Investigations are carried out by the police in conjunction with other bodies, including the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, the Health and Safety Executive, and HM Coroner, whom the police ultimately work to in relation to identification issues. Preventing an incident is obviously better than having to cope with the effects. We've been mounting high visibility patrols and implementing other key security measures to protect the people of London. We've also been encouraging businesses and other organisations to look at their security and formulate their own plan for dealing with a serious incident, whether it's an act of terrorism, or a fire or flood. We need to be prepared. - Gary Locker joined the Metropolitan Police in 1979. Following several postings in London, he took up his current role in 1997.
