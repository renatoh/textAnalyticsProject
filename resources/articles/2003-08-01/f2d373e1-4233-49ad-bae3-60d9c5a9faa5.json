He was charged with violent conduct for alleged retaliation in the Community Shield match only hours after the England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson revealed that the defender had declared his grievances to the Swede and Football Association officials. He misses tonight's friendly against Croatia with a shoulder injury, but there is a fear of a lasting estrangement. The irate Arsenal centre-half arranged the meeting to state his distress over the disciplinary treatment he has received to the FA chief executive Mark Palios, the director of football David Davies and Eriksson on Monday. That exchange had no effect on the independent operation of the video advisory panel, as the FA demonstrated that it would not bow to the wishes of a powerful club. Although the match referee Steve Bennett missed the Community Shield incident, the panel has made its own assessment. If found guilty, the centre-back will receive a three-match ban that would further handicap an Arsenal side with a vulnerable defence. It will take some time to exhaust the appeal process, but Campbell's equanimity has evaporated. A player usually regarded as sportsmanlike may find that he has, in effect, suffered a third red card since April. He was dismissed for a professional foul in the game with Everton on Saturday. Although he was on the field for a mere 25 minutes of that match, Eriksson stated that Campbell's shoulder injury is genuine. All the same, the FA was sufficiently worried by his possible alienation to agree to Monday's meeting \"It is important if a player is unhappy with the disciplinary process when he is reporting to an England squad, which is part of the FA, that senior FA officials take time, with the England coach, to ensure that the relationship is what it should be,\" an FA spokesman said. \"It was a constructive conversation which needed to be had.\" Eriksson had anticipated trouble. \"I talked to him on the phone before I picked the squad and [on Monday] I had a long chat with him, together with FA people,\" the coach said. \"I tried to explain the views from the FA's [position]. It's very complicated. \"I think he's been extremely unlucky at the end of last season and the start of this one. He wanted to have a hearing last season and he didn't get it and it's understandable that he's very disappointed. But, apart from the shoulder, he is OK. We had a good talk. Sol is not a dirty player. He is a very tough player and I think it hurts to run into him.\" While yesterday's charge proved that he has been dealt with impartially, it is a concern that a prized player should believe he is being victimised by the FA. Campbell's feelings have been raw since the red card against Manchester United in April that led to him missing the run-in. Any hope that he might soon be placated vanished in the aftermath of the Community Shield. Following a dangerously high challenge by Eric Djemba-Djemba, Campbell appeared to flick a boot at the seat of the midfielder's pants. Despite the defender's outrage over that episode, Campbell has no complaint over the ordering-off against Everton and will serve a one-game ban when Arsenal meet Manchester City on August 31, shortly before England meet Macedonia. If there is a fracture in the relationship it is one that the FA will find difficult to heal. It can do little more than adopt sympathetic expressions. Palios, with his background in the game, is no martinet. \"An ex-player will always understand the problem a footballer might have,\" Eriksson said. The FA, though, does not regret the red card shown after Campbell threw an arm out at Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in April. \"Sol feels that he was punished when he didn't deserve to be and that nobody listened to him,\" the Arsenal manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger complained. While it is true that Campbell was not allowed to make a personal appearance before a disciplinary commission, the video advisory panel did review and uphold its original decision. It is unfortunate that Djemba-Djemba's recklessness in the more recent game with United will go unpunished. That episode is closed because Bennett dealt with it at the time by awarding a foul. With the Arsenal defender and Jonathan Woodgate both injured, John Terry will face Croatia tonight. It is almost exactly a year since he was cleared on all charges relating to a violent night club incident and the Chelsea centre-half, who no longer drinks alcohol, has gone on to make great progress in his career. While mastering the Liverpool forwards on Sunday it seemed, too, that he has an even more powerful physique. \"He's improved very much,\" said Eriksson. \"He's quicker and he's playing more regularly for his club.\" With the players fresh, the crowd will be spared a procession of substitutions this evening, although it is certain that David James will appear only for the first half. In one area, Eriksson lacks scope for variation. England risk being a team of slender means in attack. The coach has only Michael Owen, Emile Heskey and James Beattie to breach the visitors' defence tonight. On a more grave occasion that would be a cause of disquiet. Sol's indiscretions April 16 Sent off in 2-2 draw with Manchester United and is ruled out of the last three league games of the season and the FA Cup final. August 10 Clashes with the new United signing Eric Djemba-Djemba in the Community Shield, but scapes caution from the referee Steve Bennett. August 16 Receives red card after fouling the Everton midfielder Thomas Gravesen during the first half of the opening game of the Premiership season at Highbury. August 19 After being ruled out of England's game against Croatia with a shoulder problem, he is charged by the FA with violent conduct over his clash with Djemba-Djemba."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
