Much of Corinne Bailey Rae's forthcoming second album, The Sea, written since her husband's death by accidental overdose last year, has a hymnal quality that was heightened by the Tabernacle's tranquil atmosphere. Rae has been out of action for most of the past 18 months, and looked nervous at this full-length return to live performance. Physically small \u2013 just a cloud of ringlets could be seen from the back of the room \u2013 and emotionally delicate, she inspired fierce protectiveness in the audience, who greeted old songs and new with loud approval. She thanked us more than once for \"being so supportive\". It's trite to suggest that Rae has become a more soulful vocalist since her loss, but there's a depth of feeling that didn't exist on her 3m-selling debut. The breeziness of that album was occasionally present here in a life-goes-on way, lighting up new tunes such as Paris Nights and New York Mornings, but it was her otherwise sombre, pained delivery that made this show moving. Her band made much use of small, distinctive sounds including sleigh bells and a metronome tick, accentuating the yearning lyrics of I'd Do It All Again and Love's On Its Way. While singing The Sea's title track, she seemed dreamy and tender \u2013 and miles from west London. The No 2 hit from 2005, Put Your Records On, ended the show sunnily, with even the band applauding as she left the stage, but the spell of the aching new songs lingered."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
