Two months since England\u2019s Euro 2020 qualifier in Montenegro was tarnished by monkey chants from some of the home crowd, Southgate and his coaching staff, together with senior figures at the Football Association, have been deliberating about what action the players should take if the same happens again. The manager has spoken to Danny Rose, Raheem Sterling and Callum Hudson-Odoi, as well as a number of others, and not one backed the idea of leaving the pitch. Instead, the players have been encouraged to lodge a complaint to the referee, or ask the coaching staff to do so on their behalf, as soon as they hear anything, rather than wait until after the match. Southgate is aware not everyone will agree with that stance but has decided he has to go with the wishes of his players and place trust in the authorities who, he acknowledges, have often left the impression they are not taking the issue seriously enough. \u201cIn Montenegro we picked it [the abuse] up only in the last five minutes, so there\u2019s a difference between that and if things happen earlier in a game,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve discussed ways we can make the players more comfortable, or that we can manage, if they hear things earlier. How would we report those more easily? We\u2019ve encouraged them to speak up when it happens. \u201cThey are clear they don\u2019t want the story at the end to be about them as individuals. They want football to be the story. But they have had an opportunity to speak [publicly] and have an impact that way. In terms of walking off the pitch, that isn\u2019t something they are all on board with. In fact, none of the current team has expressed that as a preference. The bit that isn\u2019t clear to me if we did that \u2013 apart from the question of whether we would be penalised \u2013 is what would happen then? It would be a statement, but what would that lead to?\u201d He added: \u201cThere are lots of statements that have been made and haven\u2019t led to change and reform. For me, the broader discussion around racism \u2013 education \u2013 is key. A lot of our players and former players have spoken brilliantly about that in recent months.\u201d Nevertheless, Southgate is aware that many people feel his players have an obligation to refuse to play if there is racist abuse. There has already been a 24-hour boycott of social media, organised by the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association, but many anti-racism campaigners believe the time has come for England to be more proactive. Southgate thinks differently and, speaking at a press conference to announce his squad for the Nations League, it was put to him that England might be missing the opportunity to send a powerful message to the rest of the sporting world. \u201cIt is hypothetical at the moment because we are not in that situation but I am back to [my previous answer],\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need any more symbolic statements that this is unacceptable. It is totally unacceptable, but I am still not clear [what it would achieve]. What change will that enforce? \u201cSomehow we have to enforce that change and education on society, and I think we must strive to do that. I know there is a wide variation of opinions from people who think this is the right thing and people who are less sure. My players\u2019 feeling is the most important thing for me.\u201d Southgate added: \u201cI\u2019ve spent a fair bit of time speaking with Raheem, Danny, Callum. We went through a long process with all of our staff and will pick it up with the players again. I hope \u2013 and I feel from what they have told me \u2013 they feel well supported. In terms of the care, they know where we stand and that we\u2019re there for them.\u201d Uefa fined Montenegro\u2019s football federation \u00a317,250 and ordered it to play the next home game in an empty stadium. \u201cThere\u2019s a one-match ban, which is significant for any country, but there will always be a view that it should be harsher,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to disagree on the one hand, but it\u2019s also hard to pitch those sanctions at the right level for one country that might have less revenue than bigger countries. \u201cMy priority is: do my players feel supported from within their dressing room by their own federation? I believe that to be the case. Can we then affect things on a broader scale? I think we\u2019ve tried to do that with the players and the staff [speaking out]. The chairman [Greg Clarke] put that at the top of his agenda with a speech to Uefa. We\u2019re trying to make changes in the right areas and we have to follow the right procedures.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
