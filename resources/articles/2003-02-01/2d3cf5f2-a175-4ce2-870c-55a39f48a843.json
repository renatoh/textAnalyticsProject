Samways, one of England's few successful footballing exports, appeared to have turned his back on Colin Lee's side earlier today. It was reported that the 34-year-old had signed a contract until the end of the season with his club in Spain, Las Palmas. But the former Everton and Spurs midfielder has now signed for the Saddlers until the end of the season. Lee told the club's official website, www.saddlers.co.uk: \"I have not seen Vinny in action for a while, but I have received glowing reports from our contacts in Spain and have also spoken at length about him with Roberto Martinez and Gerry Armstrong. \"He is a player that I worked with briefly during my time at Wolves. He has a great left foot and likes to get stuck into the action and make things happen. He is also very adept in set-piece situations, an area in which we need to see an improvement. \"On top of all that, he knows what the game is all about in this country and has the experience and know-how to help drive us forward. \"The deal has taken a little longer than we expected to conclude but I am delighted to finally have Vinny on board and hope that he will help bring about an improvement in our fortunes over the remaining 15 games of the season.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
