Playing the sort of fluid, attacking football that was absent throughout their Concacaf qualifying campaign, Mexico ran riot at the Azteca Stadium. Paul Aguilar, Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez, Oribe Peralta (2) and Rafa M\u00e1rquez gave Mexico a five-goal lead. Chris James scored a late consolation for New Zealand to create a tiny sliver of hope for the second leg in Wellington next week. But the All Whites \u2013 who instead played this playoff in all black \u2013 were outclassed and have left themselves a mountain to climb in the second leg. New Zealand's cause will not be helped by a number of yellow cards which will leave key players suspended for the second leg. New head coach Miguel Herrera \u2013 the fourth in five games for El Tri \u2013 rang the changes, dropping all overseas-based players and organizing his squad around Mexico's dominant domestic side, Club Am\u00e9rica. Mexico scored only seven goals in 10 games in the final stage of Concacaf qualification, but broke through under new coach Herrera, who dispensed with the services of players such as Manchester United's Chicharito Hern\u00e1ndez. Aguilar put Mexico ahead with an opportunistic strike among a confused defence in the 32nd minute. Jimenez made it 2-0 before the break. Peralta added another moments into the second half as a thrusting move split the defence wide open for a simple poke home. Peralta added another before veteran Marquez scored in the 84th minute. James scored New Zealand's consolation a minute later. Among the dejected Kiwis, goalkeeper Glen Moss must surely be the most disappointed: the scoreline failing to reflect his performance and a string of fine saves. Mexico, who required a late USA winner against Panama to even reach the playoff, face New Zealand in the second leg next Wednesday.
