The father, named locally as Julian Mynott, 42, and his son, Freddie, were pronounced dead at the scene, close to the family home in Barford, near Warwick. Their small motorised boat is thought to have capsized when it went over a three-metre high weir as the four were coming back to the shore from a trip. Witnesses said the river was higher than normal at the time, and there was a strong current. Freddie was pulled from the water at about 8.30pm on Saturday and Mynott, an antiques dealer, was found shortly after 10pm. A local resident and a police officer managed to rescue the two surviving children, a girl and a boy, according to the West Midlands Ambulance Service. The girl suffered a cardiac arrest and was later transferred to Birmingham children's hospital where she was said to be seriously ill but stable while the boy was described as conscious but poorly. Neighbours and friends spoke warmly of Mynott, and his wife Emma, 41, who was not on board the boat, and said they were thinking of them and their two other children, Florence and Archie. Polly Bonner-Evans, who lives close to the family, said: \"They were just really lovely people. The family were so kind, so nice, pleasant.\" The family only moved into their home in Barford in February after carrying out restoration work. Charles Barlow, who lives in Barford, said the community was shocked and saddened by what had happened. \"As kids we used to canoe up and down the river with scouts, so if ever the river was the way it is now we wouldn't go anywhere near the weir,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
