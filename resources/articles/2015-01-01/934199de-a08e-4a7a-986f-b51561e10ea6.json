Or transferring the same now triple Helpmann award-winning production to the Playhouse at the Sydney Opera House before a national tour? Some companies might like Sweet Charity\u2019s problems, of course, but all eyes were on Luckiest Productions to see if they could successfully scale up 2014\u2019s biggest word-of-mouth hit from Hayes. And they did, they have \u2013 without losing any of its small-time charm. It helps that the aforementioned award-winners are still on board: best director Dean Bryant, best choreographer Andrew Hallsworth and, of course, best actress in a musical, Verity Hunt-Ballard, previously known for playing Mary Poppins. No \u201cpractically perfect in every way\u201d here though. Hunt-Ballard resumes her role as Charity Hope Valentine, a nightclub hostess at the Fandango Ballroom (about as salubrious a spot as that name suggests), with Martin Crewes playing all three of her beaux: no good lover Charlie, international movie star Vittorio and odd-ball neurotic Oscar. Sweet Charity is one of those musicals you might not think you know \u2013 until the songs kick in and you realise half of them are classics. And here, Hallsworth\u2019s choreography and Andrew Worboys\u2019s musical arrangements stay true to composer Cy Coleman and the great Bob Fosse, while (if it\u2019s not sacrilege to say) freshening things up a bit. Bryant\u2019s production could only have been made in 2014, at a moment when the feminist debate is once again embracing the full contradictions of being a woman. The \u201cdancers\u201d at the Fandango are a fearsome bunch, running their own lives but trapped by them too. Their slack jaws and dead eyes during the show\u2019s biggest number, Big Spender, foreshadow the later heartbreak of There\u2019s Gotta Be Something Better Than This, and Baby, Dream Your Dream (showcasing the excellent Debora Krizak and Kate Cole). But there are joyfully uplifting if demented moments, too, not least the second half opener, The Rhythm of Life and the Mexican-tinged I\u2019m A Brass Band, showing off Tim Chappell\u2019s costumes to great effect. Then there\u2019s Charity, the girl with the biggest dream of all: love. Hunt-Ballard could make you fall for anyone, my companion commented. A true comedienne, she has the slapstick skills, the expressive face and, yes, \u201cthe purity\u201d to bring her character\u2019s charm to life \u2013 and make her rotten luck all the more poignant. Bryant is wise to let the fringe origins of this production shine through on the bigger stage \u2013 it\u2019s spontaneous, skilfully unpolished and just a little down at heel, like its heroine. Let\u2019s hope for the sake of Australian theatre it isn\u2019t the last Hayes show to make the mainhouse switch. Like sweet Charity, we all deserve a break. Sweet Charity is at Sydney Opera House, until 8 February; Canberra Theatre Centre, 11-12 February; Arts Centre Melbourne, 25 February - 1 March; Illawarra Arts Centre, Wolloongong, 11-15 March."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
