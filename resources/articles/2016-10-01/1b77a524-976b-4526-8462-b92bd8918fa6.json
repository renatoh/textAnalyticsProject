Rudd tweeted his congratulations to Guterres, saying his election was \u201ca tribute to him and Portugal\u201d and that he would have \u201ca great responsibility now for a troubled world\u201d. The former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark also congratulated her \u201clongtime colleague\u201d Guterres, whose seven years as prime minister and subsequent 10 years as UN high commissioner for refugees overlapped with her nine years in office and seven years as administrator of the UN development program. Unlike Rudd, Clark was a confirmed candidate in the race. Guterres\u2019s appointment will be confirmed in a formal vote on Thursday, after emerging as a \u201cclear favourite\u201d of all 15 ambassadors during the security council\u2019s sixth straw poll on Wednesday, in a rapid conclusion to what was expected to be a drawn-out selection process. As late as Tuesday there was speculation Rudd could still slip into the top job via nomination by another country or by the security council itself, despite never being a confirmed candidate. The impending vote sparked renewed interest in his 10-point plan to reform the UN, outlined in an opinion piece in the Guardian in August. In July Malcolm Turnbull said he refused to nominate his former opponent for the top job because it was his \u201cconsidered judgment\u201d the two-time Labor PM was not suited to the role. Clark, in contrast, received the nomination of the NZ government, and had the popular support of twice as many Australians as Rudd."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
