Depp appeared on US talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live! where the host labelled Australia a \u201cdumb country\u201d when interviewing Depp about the apology video after Heard was charged with illegally bringing their dogs, Pistol and Boo, into the country. \u201cHe [Joyce] looks somehow inbred with a tomato. It\u2019s not a criticism, I\u2019m just saying, I was a little worried \u2026 he might explode,\u201d Depp said. At a press conference on Wednesday morning Joyce responded to the actor\u2019s insults with humour. \u201cI think I\u2019m turning into Johnny Depp\u2019s Hannibal Lecter, aren\u2019t I?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m inside his head, I\u2019m pulling little strings and pulling little levers. Long after I\u2019ve forgotten about Mr Depp, he\u2019s remembering me.\u201d The agriculture minister also thanked Depp for the free publicity on Australia\u2019s biosecurity laws. Depp suggested the video was not sincere after Kimmel said it was the greatest apology he had ever seen. \u201cThere are things you have to prepare a long time for to be able to tap into the emotion,\u201d he said. \u201cI played that anti-government Australia, when someone threatens to euthanise your dogs ... tiny teacup things, [that are] clearly dangerous in Australia because of so many poisonous creatures in Australia you could die at any minute, so the dogs were obviously a problem.\u201d Depp said \u201can absolute genius\u201d had written the apology and it was directed by an iPhone but there may have been more than one take because \u201csometimes you have to giggle a little\u201d. When asked if he watched the video before releasing it, Depp responded: \u201cNo, because I didn\u2019t want to kill myself.\u201d \u201cI think the choice they made to utilise the taxpayers\u2019 dollars to globally chase down teacup yorkies and give them 50 hours to live, I realised the badness of my ways, I was kind of repenting.\u201d The charges were dropped against Heard after the pair released the video which Magistrate Bernadette Callaghan said at the time was \u201cof far more benefit to this country\u201d as a warning to would-be illegal importers than any conviction recorded against Heard. The agriculture minister made global headlines when he said the dogs had to \u201cbugger off\u201d to California or face being euthanised within 50 hours after it was discovered they had not been declared when they entered Australia. Depp has already mocked the apology since the charges were dropped. ABC reported on Wednesday that Joyce was asked if there was a vegetable he would prefer to be compared to. \u201cSomething sleek and sensitive, just like me,\u201d he responded."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
