On a night of mannered, slightly bruised reunions at Selhurst Park it seemed fitting that a meeting of Alan Pardew\u2019s Crystal Palace and John Carver and Alan Pardew\u2019s Newcastle United should end up a 1-1 draw, played out in an atmosphere that simmered but never came close to the more profound hostility of Pardew\u2019s time in charge at Newcastle, or indeed the slightly theatrical build-up. Before kick off as the pitch teemed with its usual pre-match cast \u2013 cheerleaders, mascots, eagle \u2013 it was almost tempting to imagine Palace\u2019s manager emerging finally from the players\u2019 tunnel on a chariot, or a carnival float or a chrome-plated Segway. In the event he appeared on foot to chants of \u201cSuper Alan Pardew\u201d from the home fans, while on the far side Newcastle\u2019s supporters, so often enraged by Pardew\u2019s presence when he was one of their own, offered something close to a mass yawn of indifference. Perhaps they were just busy reading the manager\u2019s programme notes, which had already brought the first virtuoso performance of the night as Pardew thanked pretty much everyone short of Sting, Gazza and Jimmy Nail and managed both to praise and passive-aggressively chastise Newcastle\u2019s fans for their behaviour during his \u201cfabulous time\u201d in the North-east. \u201cI can assure each and every one of them ... that I bear no grudge,\u201d Pardew concluded, which no doubt came as huge comfort to the three thousand or so gathered here. \u201cAlan Pardew is full of shit,\u201d the away fans began to sing with 25 minutes gone, only to be drowned out by a more favourable review from the home sections. And if at times it all felt a little forced, a little tokenistic, then Pardew\u2019s departure from Newcastle was always a surprisingly smooth and amicable process, jarringly so given the intensity of his time at St James\u2019 Park. Here there was the extra cushioning effect of the enduring friendship between the two managers, evident again in the winks and hugs before kick off. Earlier this week Carver had described this as an occasion of fierce fraternal intimacy, a micro-struggle between two men entirely familiar with one another\u2019s ways. What minute, devastating adjustments would he have in store here? Pretty much the same old same old as it turned out, as Newcastle\u2019s starting eleven contained just one outfield player, Massadio Ha\u00efdara, absent from Pardew\u2019s last game in charge. Perhaps this explained the bizarrely sluggish tempo of the opening 44 minutes. Never mind the background intrigue, here was a first half with an almost total absence of ragged edges, a case of Pardew squared, total Alan-ification, as two teams schooled by the same manager played the same way: physical strength in the middle, pace on the flanks, crosses from wide. It was from here that the opening goal came as Daryl Janmaat, signed under Pardew, crossed for Papiss Ciss\u00e9, a Pardew-era totem, to escape Damien Delaney, Pardew\u2019s current captain, and head home. \u201cPardew, what\u2019s the score?\u201d the away fans chanted happily, while Carver allowed himself a broad crinkly smile. Midway through the second half, as Frazier Campbell slid in Palace\u2019s equaliser Pardew\u2019s celebrations were no more over the top than usual, the customary mix of leaps, hugs and bellows given extra feeling by his own decision to bring on the provider Yannick Bolasie,. And in the end a draw seemed the most fitting result. A point (\u201cGold dust,\u201d was Pardew\u2019s verdict) made this a decent night for Palace. On Newcastle\u2019s side it was simply another moment of quiet consolidation for a club that will remain content to drift, profitably, in the Premier League doldrums. Whatever the theatre of personalities here, as ever the real winner with Newcastle is always Mike Ashley. It has been clear for some time that what matters to Newcastle\u2019s owner \u2013 Pardew, Carver, Parver, Cardew \u2013 is not so much doing well in the Premier League as simply existing there, retaining a seat at the greatest bean-feast in club football history. From a certain angle the appointment of his current coach almost looks like moment of Pygmalion-style satire: bring me a man in a tracksuit, he\u2019ll be manager enough for me. Newcastle will drift on safely from here. The rest is really just noise."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
