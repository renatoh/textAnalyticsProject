Bowe, a Wall Street financier turned chief executive of Intermarket, told the News of the World he is leading a \u00a3100m bid for the troubled club. Bowe has been with Intermarket for only a month, but what a splash he has been determined to make in such a short time. Intermediaries for other bidders for West Ham have never heard of him or of Intermarket, a Canary Wharf-based financial analysis company, and were surprised that he should blow his cover within 48 hours of making first contact with the club's owners. Indeed, Bowe's claims were so strong as to require some further information: who are his investors; where do they come from; how much money will be available? But strangely, no one at Intermarket would answer any questions about the supposed deal yesterday. There was time only to hear a \"no comment\" response before Intermarket hung up. Without engaging in detail, a spokesman for West Ham's owner, Straumur, hinted that there was nothing in Bowe's claims. But it certainly suits Intermarket's two director-shareholders, David Byrne and Iain Mortley, to be talked about as \u00a3100m bidders for a Premier League club. Their businesses were set up less than 18 months ago each with \u00a31,000 in share capital, but now Bowe has ensured their name has been promoted globally. Sadly for West Ham, Jim Bowe has only given them a look at what they could have won. Super, lovely, smashing, great! Counting on Sven Events move fast in seven days in Sven's world. Last Wednesday Sven-Goran Eriksson is asked if he can confirm whether he will remain with Notts County, where he is director of football. \"Of course I can, absolutely,\" he asserts. Less than a week later Sweden's football federation president, Lars-Ake Lagrell, confirms talks will take place over Eriksson becoming manager of Sweden, a nation that has not even qualified for the World Cup. That's commitment. No approach has been made to County, who would suffer in more than football terms if he leaves. They like Eriksson to accompany the chairman, Peter Trembling, at business meetings, where insiders say his presence has been requested and he helps \"max out\" deals. Still, even if Eriksson goes from being \"focused\" on the search for a replacement for the sacked County manager Ian McParland to a team that has no competitive fixtures for about a year, County win a million. There is a seven-figure compensation clause in his contract. Mosley mystery So febrile has this week's FIA presidential election become that even the identity of the FIA official sent to the Paris high court today is occupying minds. The FIA must answer a subpoena regarding the ballot process, but the FIA has been so dismissive of Ari Vatanen's demand for the courts to enforce transparency in the vote that it is thought the out-going president, Max Mosley, will send a more junior official. Vatanen supporters are hoping that if Mosley declines to attend in person it might not dispose the judge to favour his organisation's case, scoring another phoney-war victory for the Finn. Inflation hits football In this era of flogging old tat on the internet, it was never going to take long for a certain beach ball to appear on eBay. So it came to pass yesterday, when the inflatable that diverted Darren Bent's shot in Sunderland's win over Liverpool went up for auction. \"I got this ball as I work at the Stadium of Light and a steward gave it to me at full-time,\" wrote Simon_SAFC08. \"I have arranged with the club to get it signed by Darren Bent!\" Last night its value had soared in the bidding to \u00a362. But there are signs it might deflate. \"I've had an email from someone called Simon_SAFC wanting a signature on a ball,\" said a Sunderland spokesman. \"But it's not something the club would do. It's not a charity request.\" matt.scott@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
