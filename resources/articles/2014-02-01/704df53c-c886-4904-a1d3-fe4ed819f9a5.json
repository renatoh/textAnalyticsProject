That was undoubtedly true at the time, but as the months go by, and Ed Miliband draws a sharper line under New Labour, the significance of the upstart younger sibling's victory has slowly emerged. In 2011, there was the early move against the Murdoch empire over phone hacking, a few months before a conference speech that denounced the \"predatory\" nature of much British business. The right of the party was left scratching, as well as shaking, its head, but now that populist policies on fuel bills and the banks have been produced, he can no longer be accused of saying nothing. You might not like the Miliband message, and its electoral appeal remains entirely untested, but whether the question is media magnates, big corporations or \u2013 most recently \u2013 Washington, with its presumption that Britain would join the military action in Syria that Mr Miliband helped stop, he has, in his quiet way, challenged rather than sought approval from power. In his Hugo Young lecture, at the Guardian's building, on Monday night he seeks to extend this narrative to concentrations of power within public services, a form of power whose abuse old Labour was too slow to acknowledge. Exactly as with the first airing of the \"predators versus producers\" distinction in industry, there is the germ of an interesting discourse here, but an extraordinary amount of missing detail. A plan, still under development, to create a new \"middle tier\" between Whitehall and individual schools is a signal of intent to add local accountability back in to a post-Govian educational ecology, in which academies are nearly ubiquitous. But the distinction between Conservative \"free schools\" and Labour \"parent-led academies\" will baffle all but experts; and it is far from clear what practical difference is made by transferring to patients and parents \"ownership\" of personal data which they can already demand to see. No matter, the speech's significance lies less in its specific proposals than in the change of tone it represents. In place of the \"market-based individualism\" of the later Blair years, which imagined changing schools was as easy as swapping supermarkets, Mr Miliband emphasises collective co-production between professionals, local councils and then \u2013 interestingly \u2013 also communities of service users with particular problems, currently stuck in the same boat. These are modest as well as sketchy thoughts, but \u2013 wearied by cuts, which will not soon stop, and by permanent revolution \u2013 the public services might fare better with such incremental advances than yet another grand plan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
