They have certainly enhanced their chances with this victory and if they can beat Olympiakos in Athens in their final group match then Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s record of having qualified for the knockout stages in 15 successive seasons may yet be extended. Even then, there are conditions attached given that, in its simplest terms, it effectively takes on the form of a second-leg tie to find out who finishes as runners-up in Group F to Bayern Munich. Olympiakos came away with a 3-2 win from their visit to London in September and that means Arsenal must overturn that result when they play at the Georgios Karaiskakis Stadium. It leaves them with a credible chance and one imagines they would have gladly been in this position after the ordeal of losing their first two group games. They should also be relatively optimistic about completing the recovery if they can replicate this kind of fluent, attacking display, with Mesut \u00d6zil and Alexis S\u00e1nchez at the heart of it. Both scored in the four-minute spell of the first half when Arsenal turned their supremacy into the hard currency of goals. S\u00e1nchez then turned in another midway through the second half and by the end of a slick, stress-free evening there was at least a new sense of hope among the stands. The unusually large expanses of empty seats \u2013 Arsenal\u2019s official attendance of 58,978 was deceptive, calculating the number of tickets sold rather than an accurate crowd figure \u2013 indicated that many supporters had started to lose hope about this campaign. Yet the score updates from Munich, where it quickly became apparent it was beyond Olympiakos to produce a result that would have put them through, gave Arsenal\u2019s crowd encouragement and the team certainly played as though they considered themselves alive. At the very least, Arsenal have assured themselves of a place in the Europa League. Dinamo were moderate opponents and their conservatism, operating deep inside their own half, initially managed to subdue Arsenal. The pressure, however, was concerted and Wenger\u2019s men passed the ball with the speed and accuracy that would have troubled much more refined opposition. H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn was often operating as an auxiliary winger, doubling up with Joel Campbell on the right, while Nacho Monreal was almost as advanced on the other side. Santi Cazorla was full of clever little touches and once Arsenal had scored twice in quick succession it was a position of strength they never seemed likely to relinquish. The first goal originated in their own half, with Cazorla prominently involved in a blur of quick, crisp passing that eliminated four Dinamo players on one of their rare attacking forays. Arsenal were suddenly counter-attacking at speed and the ball was with S\u00e1nchez on the left. \u00d6zil showed great determination to get into the six-yard area, sprinting forwards and turning in the cross with a stooping header. Arsenal were so dominant it must pain Wenger that the 2-1 defeat in Zagreb in September has left them so vulnerable. Leonardo Sigali\u2019s mistake for the second goal was the hard evidence of how they had flustered the Croatian champions. Another wave of attacking had just broken down when the ball arrived at the centre-back\u2019s feet and it was a dismal attempt on his part to find one of his team-mates. Sigali\u2019s pass went straight to Monreal, who showed great anticipation, driving into the penalty area, resisting the chance to shoot himself and turning the ball inside for S\u00e1nchez to score from a more inviting angle. Wenger was entitled to think his side were so in control, with \u00d6zil and Cazorla creating so many problems, that they should have added further goals before half-time but after the break the tempo did falter for a while. For Arsenal, there was no longer any requirement to press forward with so much urgency. All the same, the speed and intelligence of their attacking play led to plenty of other openings and a splendid third goal, created by Campbell with a darting run and beautifully weighted pass. Campbell can still be raw sometimes but he has good acceleration and his first thought is always to head goalwards. He had cut in from the right, with the ball on his left boot, and his angled pass sliced open the Dinamo defence. S\u00e1nchez darted in to take the ball around the goalkeeper Eduardo and scooped his shot high into the exposed goal. By that stage, Wenger had brought on Aaron Ramsey in place of Olivier Giroud for his first action since damaging his hamstring a month ago. Petr Cech\u2019s brilliant reflex save spared Mathieu Flamini an own goal but it was a rare moment of alarm and when Arsenal can play with this exuberance it just makes it perplexing the trip to Greece cannot be a more straightforward occasion."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
