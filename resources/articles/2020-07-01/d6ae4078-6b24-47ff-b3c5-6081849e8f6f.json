In a special appearance on the ABC\u2019s Q&amp;A on Monday, Gillard, Australia\u2019s first and only female prime minister, said she \u201cshould have\u201d confronted sexist coverage of her in the mainstream media in the early days of her leadership saying it was \u201ca conversation we needed to have\u201d. \u201cI do muse to myself that, you know, the second day I was prime minister, the news media was entirely about the jacket I wore,\u201d she said. \u201cEntirely. Like, no one reported anything I said the second day I was prime minister. It was all about what I was wearing. And I wonder now if, you know, on the third day I was prime minister, if I\u2019d gone out to the Canberra press pack and said, \u2018Is anybody feeling a little bit silly about this? If I\u2019d been a bloke wearing a suit, would you have put that on the news yesterday? Oh, my God, he\u2019s got a charcoal suit on! Would anybody cover that? Are we going to keep doing this for as long as I\u2019m prime minister?\u2019 \u201cI\u2019m not sure what the reaction in the pack would have been \u2013 bemusement by some, defensive by others, but maybe it\u2019s a conversation we needed to have.\u201d Gillard was subject to a number of notable examples of sexism while serving as Australia\u2019s prime minister from 2010-13. In recent years she has become well known internationally for her \u201cmisogyny speech\u201d to parliament. On Monday she appeared in a special episode of Q&amp;A ahead of the release of her book about women in leadership. Talking about sexist coverage during her leadership, she said that in hindsight she wished she used the political capital of her early leadership to address the issue, as well as asking other high-profile Australians to speak out against sexism, but said she \u201cdidn\u2019t realise it was going to get as mad as it did around gender\u201d. \u201cI think if the CEOs of Australia\u2019s top 10 leading companies \u2013 the day after the rally with the \u2018bitch witch\u2019 signs \u2013 if they\u2019d done a letter to the newspaper which said, \u2018look, people can have a variety of views about putting a price on carbon, they\u2019re all legitimate views, we should be having a debate, but we don\u2019t have a debate calling the prime minister of the country with sexist terms,\u2019 I think that would have been really noted,\u201d she said. \u201cBut things like that didn\u2019t happen. And I\u2019m not putting blame on anyone \u2013 I didn\u2019t do it, so I\u2019m not saying \u2018I now blame those people for not doing it\u2019. I think we all underestimated how it was going to cycle up, and so none of us came in early enough.\u201d During the program, Gillard was asked for advice about women in leadership, but also faced questions about her opposition to same-sex marriage during her leadership, and other decisions including a funding cut to welfare payments for single parents. On same-sex marriage, Gillard said she had voted \u2018yes\u2019 in Australia\u2019s plebiscite on the issue but that did not believe she could have passed legislation while prime minister. \u201cI know that there are some people who think, well, if I\u2019d brought same-sex marriage legislation into the parliament, maybe we would have had same-sex marriage earlier,\u201d she said. \u201cMy political judgment is that wouldn\u2019t have happened, because \u2013 as you would recall, we were a minority government. At that stage, I think the Liberal party would have bloc-voted against same-sex marriage \u2013 they wouldn\u2019t have had a conscience vote or a free vote. \u201cIt would have become a partisan issue in the real hurly-burly of politics. And you remember how hard the hurly-burly was then \u2013 whatever one can say about Tony Abbott, he\u2019s a formidable campaigner, and I think this would have been an issue that he brought his formidable campaigning skills to. And that would not have been in anybody\u2019s interests to have that highly partisan debate. \u201cI actually don\u2019t think we would have got it through the parliament at that point.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
