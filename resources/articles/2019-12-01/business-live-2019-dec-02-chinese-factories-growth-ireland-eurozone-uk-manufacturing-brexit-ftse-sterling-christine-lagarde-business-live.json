Today\u2019s drama could be a good buying opportunity for those not invested in Brazil (but will only make a bad situation worse in Argentina). So argues Kim Catechis, the Head of Investment Strategy at asset manager Martin Currie. Here\u2019s the theory: Brazil is in a good place right now, with the economy coming out of the deepest recession in history and interest rates and inflation at their lowest levels. Brazil exported around $2bn of steel to the U.S. in the first 10 months of 2019, equivalent to around 9% of total exports to the U.S. For Brazil, exports to the USA are 12.47% of total exports (source: WITS (WTO)) and far behind China\u2019s 22% of exports. Meanwhile, Brazil imports around $25bn of goods from the U.S., which could potentially become subject to retaliatory tariffs, around half of these imports are of refined oil products. The next biggest category of imports is integrated circuits, which come from the U.S. chip manufacturers. In 2018, there were $6bn of aircraft exports. The Brazilian-made Embraer regional jet is widely used in U.S. airlines \u2013 part of the reason that Boeing has signed a strategic partnership with Embraer. For investors in Brazil, this is a sideshow unless the tariffs spread to other categories besides aluminium and steel. For many Brazilians, this smells like revenge for their country\u2019s soybean farmers bonanza \u2013 they have benefitted enormously from the U.S.-China trade war by replacing U.S. soybeans sales into China.\u201d Some context. Despite today\u2019s falls, the UK\u2019s blue-chip FTSE 100 index is still up over 8% this year. And here\u2019s the damage across Europe today. Not a crash, of course, but certainly a poor day. Wall Street is also firmly in the red. The Dow Jones industrial average is currently down by 235 points or 0.8%, as the clocks strike noon in New York. Newsflash: European stock markets have posted their biggest fall in two months, after Donald Trump hit Brazil and Argentina with new tariffs. Fears that relations with Beijing could deteriorate also hurt stocks, after Wilbur Ross threatened China with new levies if a deal isn\u2019t reached. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has closed 60 points lower at 7283, down 0.8%, a one-week low. With heavy losses in Germany and France (both down 1.9%), the EU-wide Stoxx 600 index hit a two-week low - in its worst one-day fall since early October. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets says Trump\u2019s \u2018economic illiteracy\u2019 is behind the move. European stocks have rolled over into the red, after President Trump decided, as a post-Thanksgiving gift to re-impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from Brazil and Argentina. He also reiterated previous criticisms of the US Federal Reserve that they should continue cutting rates in order to counter the sharp falls being seen in both the Brazilian and Argentinian currencies, as he accused both countries of devaluing their currencies. He seems to have missed the point that the reason the currencies of both Brazil and Argentina are weak is not down to any deliberate or cunning plan on the part of either government, but merely because both their respective economies are in big trouble due to bad governance. Unfortunately, little details like that, don\u2019t appear to register with this particular President, which as an exercise in economic illiteracy, is hard to beat. Here\u2019s my colleague Dominic Rushe on Trump\u2019s threats: The weak manufacturing data from the US (see here) and UK (see here) also worried investors, taking the shine off the rise in Chinese factory growth. Hugh Gimber, Global Market Strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, says the slump in US factory growth was a particular blow: \u201cInvestors had been growing increasingly confident over the past few weeks that the worst of the manufacturing slowdown could be behind us, which has helped to drive equity markets to new highs. Yet today\u2019s decline in the US ISM manufacturing print is materially below expectations and stands at odds with the recent improvement in the US PMI data. A weak employment component is of particular concern given the importance of the US labour market to the health of the overall US economy. \u201cLooking ahead to next year, we expect global growth to remain constrained by lingering geopolitical uncertainty, although central bank policy will likely still be working to limit the downside for risk assets.\u201d Donald Trump has spooked the markets once again with his latest flurry of tariffs, says Connor Campbell of SpreadEx. Oh Donald, Donald, Donald. With the markets having done their best to maintain a positive outlook on the US-China situation, despite Hong Kong becoming a political pawn between the two sides, Trump went and added another couple of enemies to his trade war portfolio. Delivering the news via, where else, Twitter, the President said that \u2018effective immediately\u2019 he would be restoring tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports from Brazil and Argentina. This as Trump claimed those countries had been \u2018presiding over a massive devaluation of their currencies\u2019 that was \u2018not good\u2019 for American farmers. Never missing a chance to attack Jerome Powell at the Federal Reserve, he ended the announcement by haranguing the central bank about lowering rates and loosening monetary policy to weaken the dollar. European markets are also sliding in late trading, as trade jitters hit stocks. The FTSE 100 is down 68 points, or nearly 1%, with heavier losses in other markets.... Uh-oh... Donald Trump\u2019s secretary of commerce, Wilbur Ross, has warned that America would impose fresh tariffs on China if a trade deal isn\u2019t agree. He was speaking on Fox News a little while ago. This is a change of tone from the White House -- recently, officials have been talking up the prospects of a Phase One trade deal soon. This has knocked Wall Street, where the S&amp;P 500 is down 0.8% so far today. Q: You say will make climate change one of the priorities of the ECB... do you have full support of that plan? How will you persuade counterparts at other central banks who think fighting the climate crisis is a fiscal issue? And what specific measures will you propose? Christine Lagarde says there are several ways of \u201cgreening\u201d the ECB\u2019s work - including adding a climate crisis focus to its analytical work, the risk assessment it carries out, and its own pension fund management. We are active in various forums, she continues. And the new strategic review will consider the ECB\u2019s activity in those forums, such as the G20. Another MEP tackles Christine Lagarde on the ECB\u2019s commitment to the climate crisis. He points out that the ECB\u2019s stimulus scheme has bought more bonds from the automotive industry, and from energy companies, than the market average, while neglecting the renewables industry. Q: will you put pressure on rating agencies, and your own risk measures, to take climate change into account within refinancing operations? Lagarde replies that it is \u201cvery important that all rating agencies take climate change into account\u201d when assessing credit-worthiness. I would hope that the three big, well known rating agencies move in that direction. If they ask me my views, I will tell them. [That\u2019s Moody\u2019s, Fitch and S&amp;P]. Lagarde repeats that \u201cwe need to have a debate\u201d about the ECB\u2019s market neutrality principle, which prevents it from overtly assisting green policies. We need to review the instruments and the tools, to ask ourselves about their appropriateness and the role that climate change should play in our decisions, she adds. All these issues will be considered through a new strategic review which Lagarde is launching. She\u2019s keen not to pre-empt (or be seen to pre-empt) its conclusions. When it comes to strategic review, it needs to be debated by all members of the governing council....I\u2019m not running a single-woman shop. Lagarde then denies that the ECB is making the climate crisis worse via its bond-buying stimulus programme. She argues that by improving financial conditions in the eurozone, the ECB is helping companies to fund new, greener projects. Back in Brussels, Christine Lagarde is being challenged about her commitment to the climate emergency. \u201cClear, precise and rapid actions\u201d are needed, one MEP points out, so what action will the ECB actually take? And isn\u2019t the ECB actually fuelling the climate crisis, by buying the debt of energy firms such as Shell and Total through its bond-buying stimulus scheme? Q: How can we finance investments to get rid of dirty, brown investments on the other side, and get the ECB out of carbon assets? In response, Lagarde agrees that the ECB\u2019s bond portfolio contains \u201cmultiple shades from green to brown\u201d. That\u2019s due to the policy of \u2018market neutrality\u2019, which means the Bank cannot use its stimulus programme to support green policies. Should this policy be revised? How? That will be part of the review that we need to conduct, Lagarde says. Some critics have argued that this market neutrality policy is hampering the fight against the climate crisis, as it means the ECB must buy bonds issued by heavy polluters as part of its QE programme. Lagarde also reiterates that the ECB needs to \u201cembed climate change imperatives\u201d in its work, including its economic forecasting. Newsflash: America\u2019s factory output contracted last month, according to the closely-watched ISM survey. The ISM\u2019s US manufacturing PMI fell to 48.1 from 48.3, showing a sharper fall in output, back towards the 10-year low seen in September. Fighting the climate crisis has to be a central part of the European Central Bank\u2019s policy-making, Christine Lagarde says. The Bank\u2019s new president tells the EU Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that all individuals must do everything they can to tackle climate issues. The primary mandate of the European Central Bank is not about climate change, but price stability, Lagarde points out. But the ECB does have other, secondary, objectives - and this is where it can make a difference. Climate change must be is a key element on how, when, and why the ECB takes certain decisions, she declares, citing two examples. 1) The ECB\u2019s macro-economic modelling which generates its economic forecasts. \u201cThese models need to incorporate the risk of climate change,\u201d says Lagarde. \u201cThat\u2019s the very least, I think, we should expect.\u201d 2) The ECB\u2019s supervisory role within the eurozone financial system. The Bank should also look into whether financial institutions are taking climate change into account when making their decisions, she adds. This would be a change in policy. Lagarde\u2019s predecessor, Mario Draghi, did not prioritise climate issues -- focusing instead on fighting the eurozone debt crisis and trying to stimulate its economy. Christine Lagarde is urged the European Parliament to help tackle the gender imbalance on the ECB\u2019s governing council, during her testimony in Brussels. Currently, Lagarde is the only woman on the 25-strong governing council, as its chair. She points out that 19 of those members are male - the 19 central bank governors for each eurozone country. You could push the authorities to start appointing female central bankers -- I\u2019ve got some names if it would help -- Lagarde tells the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. She adds that she would not like to be alone as the only woman on the Council for too long. Newsflash: Christine Lagarde, the eurozone\u2019s new top central banker, has warned that Europe\u2019s economy remains weak due to \u2018global factors\u2019. She doesn\u2019t spell it out, but one obvious global factor is the trade conflicts triggered by the US in recent years, both with China and Europe, and now Brazil and Argentina too. In testimony to the European Parliament, the ECB\u2019s president says: Euro area growth remains weak, with gross domestic product growing by only 0.2%, quarter on quarter, in the third quarter of 2019. This weakness has been mainly due to global factors. The world economy outlook remains sluggish and uncertain. This lowers demand for euro area goods and services and also affects business sentiment and investment. As the sector most directly exposed to these global developments, the manufacturing industry has been suffering the most. We are also seeing signs of spillovers to other parts of the economy, with recent survey data pointing to some moderation in the services sector. Lagarde adds that the ECB will do what it can to protect the eurozone economy and help it grow, citing the new stimulus measures launched this summer. Lagarde\u2019s session hasn\u2019t started yet, but will be streamed live, here. Shares in US steel makers are up in pre-market trading, as they should benefit from tariffs on foreign rivals. However, rising prices are going to hurt US companies who actually buy steel and aluminium. European stock markets have dropped into the red since Trump\u2019s tweets hit the wires, erasing their earlier gains. The German DAX is leading the selloff, down 0.7%, while the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 has lost 0.3% or 24 points. Earlier optimism, following better-than-expected Chinese factory data, has been replaced with trade war anxiety. Shares in Brazilian steel-makers are falling as trading gets underway in S\u00e3o Paulo. S\u00e3o Paulo-based Gerdau are the biggest faller, down 1.5%, followed by Usiminas, which dropped over 1%. Both companies run major steel mills in Brazil, and could suffer once new tariffs are imposed at the US border. Argentina\u2019s government is also planning to negotiate with the US government, a spokesperson says. Brazil\u2019s President Jair Bolsonaro has responded. Bolsonaro says he could speak directly with President Donald Trump about the decision to restore tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from Brazil and Argentina, Reuters reports. Bolsonaro added that he will discuss Trump\u2019s declaration with Economy Minister Paulo Guedes (whose comments about Brazil\u2019s currency being free to float may have contributed to Trump\u2019s decision....). This decision is also a blow to Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil\u2019s right-wing president. He won power last year with a campaign based on popularism, conservative policies and divisive attacks on minority groups, pushed heavily through social media. Trump and Bolsonaro had appeared to be close allies, but this hasn\u2019t provided protection from today\u2019s tariffs. Donald Trump has clearly been riled by the slump in the Brazilian real and the Argentinian peso. The real hit a record low last week, at more than 4.25 to the dollar. Interest rate cuts, and weak economic data, had pulled the real down in recent months. But its latest tumble came after Economy Minister Paulo Guedes said he wasn\u2019t concerned about the exchange rate. Guedes told reporters: \u201cWe have a floating currency, so it floats.\u201d . Or sinks, perhaps.... The Argentinian peso hit its own record lows earlier this year, slumping 30% after the left-wing opposition surprisingly won a presidential primary, ahead of their return to power five weeks ago. It would be a mistake, though, to assume either country is jubilant about a weak currency. Both Argentina and Brazil\u2019s central banks have intervened in the markets, selling US dollars to prop up their ailing currencies. Donald Trump has also defended his trade war in a further tweet, which calls for a double fact-check! 1) Stocks are indeed higher, but that\u2019s not due to the trade war. The S&amp;P 500 index has gained 18% since March 2018, with the Dow up 14% and the Nasdaq gaining 21%. But America\u2019s various ongoing trade disputes have, if anything, dampened investor optimism. Instead, US interest rate cuts, Trump\u2019s tax reforms, and share buybacks have all played a more important role. 2) Tariffs are paid by US companies when they import goods. They either pass them onto consumers (higher prices), absorb the cost (lower profits), or try to make their supplier pick up the tab (by insisting on paying less). In practice, all three things happen - but only the last one helps the US economy. Brazil is the third-largest exporter of steel to America, points out Bloomberg\u2019s Michael McDonough, so these tariffs could have an impact. President Trump\u2019s decision is a blow to both Argentina and Brazil, who had previously persuaded the White House not to impose metal tariffs. Back in May 2018, both countries secured \u201cpermanent exemptions\u201d from the levies, which are 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium. Those tariffs were meant to protect American steel and aluminium factories from overseas competition, especially from countries which Trump accused of weakening their currencies to get an unfair advantage. Newsflash: President Donald Trump has just announced new tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from Brazil and Argentina. Trump is unhappy that Brazil and Argentina\u2019s currencies have depreciated, making their exports to the US more competitive - so he\u2019s hitting back. He is also urging America\u2019s central bank, the Federal Reserve, to cut interest rates to weaken the dollar. The Fed has already cut interest rates three times this year, to 1.5%-1.75%, but Trump wants to see them much lower. Back in the markets, the pound is dipping today as general election jitters set in. Sterling has lost a third of a cent to $1.2895, after several opinion polls showed the Conservative Party\u2019s lead over Labour has narrowed. As usual, each polling company has a different picture, but the broad trend is clear. The Daily Mirror has the details: Opinium said the gap had narrowed from 19 points to 15, with the Tories on 46% while Labour racked up 31%. YouGov said its gap was down from 11 to 9 points, with the Tories receiving 43% of the vote compared to 34% for Labour. And the Tory lead more than halved according to BMG, which claimed a 13-point gap had been cut to just six points in a week. Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics says destocking following the latest Brexit extension is hurting factories: The weakness in Britain\u2019s factories in November suggests that growth may be modest in the current quarter, having barely grown in the last six months. The CBI, which represents UK businesses, has warned that any recovery must be based on continuing to trade as freely as possible with Europe. My colleague Phillip Imman explains: Britain\u2019s stuttering economy is likely to pick up momentum over the next two years, but only if the government maintains tariff-free trade with the EU, the CBI said in its outlook for 2020. According to the business lobby group\u2019s latest economic forecast, GDP growth for over the next two years is set to remain at 1.2% in 2020 before picking up to 1.8% in 2021. The modest rebound depends on the next government negotiating an \u201cambitious trade deal\u201d with the EU that preserves much of the current arrangements and eliminates Brexit uncertainty, it said. Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI\u2019s chief economist, said the forecast was based on the UK quitting the EU in two months on 31 January. The CBI\u2019s outlook also assumed the government would provide \u201ca clear line of sight to an ambitious trade deal,\u201d by next summer. The UK PMI report also shows that factories making expensive, heavy-duty goods suffered particularly badly in November. Consumer goods makers did better, though -- perhaps benefitting from Christmas demand? Markit says: Investment goods producers remained severe, with production, new orders, new export business and employment all contracting at steeper rates than the other sub-industries. Output, new business and staffing levels at intermediate goods producers also fell. There were brighter signs from the consumer goods sector, which saw growth of both output and new orders. A triple-whammy of problems have hurt Britain\u2019s factory sector, says Andrew Symms, partner at legal firm DWF: \u201cThe UK manufacturing PMI figures illustrate the impact of global trade tensions, Brexit uncertainty and an impending General Election that has resulted in the PMI to 48.9 in November from 49.6.\u201d \u201cThe underlying data does not paint a rosy picture. Manufacturing production fell and new order inflows deteriorated from both domestic and overseas sources. Employment also fell for the eighth straight month in November. A lack of transparency caused by Brexit ambiguity is holding back investment. Manufacturers need to take positive steps to understand their supply chains, mitigate risks and ensure, to the best of their ability, that financing is available in case conditions deteriorate further.\u201d Britain\u2019s factories are also suffering from some Brexit-unwinding, as companies run down stocks built up ahead of the October 31 deadline. Duncan Brock, Group Director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, says this caused a drop in orders, leading to job losses last month: \u201cA heavy sense of inevitability hung around the sector in November as it continued to suffer the effects of a lethal cocktail of Brexit uncertainty, slowing global growth and an impending General Election. These combined to stifle any chance of manufacturing crawling out of the contraction zone, where the sector was stuck for a seventh month in a row. \u201cSupply chain managers cited weakened domestic demand and one of the biggest falls in export orders for seven years as companies unravelled their pre-Brexit stocks and resulting in one of steepest reductions in purchasing since 2013. Inevitably, where new orders fall, jobs are sure to follow and manufacturing employment fell at its fastest pace since September 2012. Firms tried to balance their books by reducing overheads and improving efficiencies quickly, and staff numbers were the casualties. \u201cWith this backdrop of pressures, the sector\u2019s performance is unlikely to change any time soon, which means a bleak beginning for the industry in 2020.\u201d Rob Dobson, Director at IHS Markit, says next week\u2019s general election is hurting Britain\u2019s factories. With orders dropping, and exports down too, firms are being forced to cut jobs to protect their finances, he warns. Here\u2019s his take on today\u2019s survey of UK purchasing managers: \u201cNovember saw UK manufacturers squeezed between a rock and hard place, as the uncertainty created by a further delay to Brexit was accompanied by growing paralysis ahead of the forthcoming general election. Downturns in output and new orders continued amid a renewed contraction in exports. The pace of job losses also hit a seven-year high as firms sought to reduce overheads in the face of falling sales. Destocking at manufacturers and their clients following the latest Brexit delay was a major contributor to the weakness experienced by the sector. Inflationary pressures meanwhile showed signs of moderating further, with input costs falling slightly for the first time since March 2016. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s factories are slashing jobs at the fastest rate in over seven years, as the sector continues to shrink. That\u2019s according to the UK manufacturing report for November, just released, which shows that political and economic uncertainty are hurting the economy. It found that manufacturing employment in the UK shrank for the eighth straight month, with the pace of job losses the steepest since September 2012. Data firm Markit reports that: The UK manufacturing downturn continued in November, as businesses responded to the delay to Brexit and a fresh injection of uncertainty from the forthcoming general election. Output, new orders and employment all fell, while destocking activity resumed as firms depleted buffers built-up in advance of the postponed exit date. Companies linked further job cuts to cost reduction efforts, efficiencies, Brexit uncertainty, redundancies, natural wastage and staff restructuring. This has dragged the UK manufacturing PMI down to 48.9 in November, down from 49.6 in October. That shows a sharper contraction. Reaction to follow! Kit Juckes of Societe Generale reports that investors are cheered by today\u2019s Chinese factory upturn, although other PMI data has been less upbeat. The first Monday of the month sees a feast of manufacturing PMI data around the world and this morning the overall impression, with some exceptions, is slightly upbeat. An Japan\u2019s came in at 48.9, up from 48.4, India\u2019s at 5.1 vs 50.6, and China\u2019s Caixin PMI came in at 51.8 vs 51.7. Russia was the most striking disappointment at 45.6 vs 47./2, but we saw a soft number for Sweden at 45.4 vs 46 last, too. Markets haven\u2019t looked beyond the Chinese data too much... Some reaction to the eurozone PMIs, from trading platform BP Prime: Just in: Eurozone factories shrank again in November, for the 10th month in a row. The IHS Markit Eurozone Manufacturing PMI has risen to 46.9 in November, a little better than expected, from October\u2019s 45.9. That\u2019s below the 50-point mark showing stagnation, continuing a contraction that began back in February. Factory bosses reported that output, and new orders, both continued to fall last month -- although at a slower rate than in October. Only Greece and France posted a rise in manufacturing activity, Markit says: Germany remained bottom of the table, despite recording its best PMI reading in five months. Austria and Spain were the next worst performing, but similarly recorded weaker rates of contraction, whilst Italy registered its lowest PMI print for eight months. This means Europe\u2019s manufacturing sector remains in recession, says Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit: \u201cA further steep drop in manufacturing output in November means the goods-producing sector is likely to have acted as a major drag on the eurozone economy again in the closing quarter of 2019. The survey data for the fourth quarter so far are indicating a quarterly rate of contraction in excess of 1% for manufacturing. But... the rise in the PMI is still a positive sign, Williamson adds. \u201cAlthough still signalling a steep rate of decline, the manufacturing PMI nonetheless brings some encouraging signals which will fuel speculation that the worst is over for euro area producers, barring any new set-backs (notably in relation to Brexit and trade wars). In particular, November saw the rate of loss of export sales easing further from July\u2019s recent record, helping pull other indicators such as output, employment, order books and purchasing off their recent lows. Back to the PMIs. Earlier, Markit reported that Australia\u2019s factories suffered a sharp tumble in new orders last month: Manufacturers in Thailand and Indonesia also found November tough: But South Korea, whose tech sector is particularly exposed to the US-China trade war, picked up last month - with its PMI rising to a seven-month high. Also in the City, shares in fashion chain Ted Baker have slumped to a 10-year low after it warned it has overstated the value of its inventory on its balance sheet. In a statement to shareholders, it says: Based on preliminary analysis, the Board estimates an impact on value of \u00a320m to \u00a325m. The Board believes that any adjustment to inventory value will have no cash impact and will relate to prior years. An independent review is underway. This has knocked 10% off its share price, to 357p, the lowest since 2009. It\u2019s the latest in a series of blows to the company, whose founder Ray Kelvin resigned earlier this year after allegations of improper conduct. Shares in mining companies are rallying, on hopes that Chinese factories will be buying more iron ore, copper and coal. Rio Tinto (+2.5%), Glencore and BHP Billiton (both 1.8%) have jumped to the top of the FTSE 100 leaderboard in London. That\u2019s lifted the Footsie by 44 points, or 0.6%, in early trading. China\u2019s improved PMI surveys have \u201cgiven the world a boost\u201d, says Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank. Ireland\u2019s manufacturers are suffering from Brexit uncertainty, says Oliver Mangan, AIB Chief Economist. He says: \u201cThe primary source of the slowdown in manufacturing is weakening foreign demand. While total orders again rose marginally in November, new export orders fell for a fifth consecutive month and at a solid pace. Firms report that Brexit related weakness in the UK as well as softer US demand are weighing on export orders. \u201cThe Irish November PMI reading of 49.7 remains well above the average for the Eurozone, which is put at 46.6, and the level of 48.3 in the UK as the stronger domestic economy helps support activity here. A further positive note is that confidence among Irish manufacturers regarding future output rose to a five-month high in November. Nonetheless, Brexit uncertainty continues to weigh on confidence levels, which remain low on a historical basis.\u201d It\u2019s easy to blame Brexit, of course. But repeated delays to the exit date, and uncertainty over border arrangements and the future UK-EU trading relationship must be making it hard for firms to plan ahead. Plus, a hard border between the Republic and the UK, wherever it is sited, would seriously impact firms who export through Britain\u2019s road network to the rest of Europe. We\u2019ll get a lot of PMI data today, but Ireland\u2019s stands out as particularly worrying. Irish manufacturing activity shrank last month, for the fifth time in six months, according to the latest healthcheck from AlB and Markit. The survey found that output fell again, forcing bosses to cut workforce numbers for the first time since September 2016. Although total new business increased for the second month running, export sales shrank at a faster pace - due to weaker demand from US and UK customers. The survey says: Export sales decreased further during November, with the rate of contraction accelerating from October. Panellists stated that they had observed an overall weakening of foreign demand conditions, singling out weaker US and UK markets. Business confidence improved to a five-month high, but remained historically weak as Brexit uncertainty weighed on sentiment. This all dragged Ireland\u2019s factory PMI down to 49.7 in November from 50.7 in October - showing a small contraction. Asia-Pacific stock markets have been lifted by the rise in Chinese factory growth. The main indices are mainly higher today, with Shanghai\u2019s CSI 300 up 0.2%. Dr. Zhengsheng Zhong, Director of Macroeconomic Analysis at CEBM Group, says China\u2019s factory slump may have bottomed out. But while today\u2019s PMI report shows some recovery, the trade war between Washington and Beijing is still hurting. \u201cChina\u2019s manufacturing sector continued to recover in November, with both domestic and overseas demand rising and the employment subindex returning to expansionary territory for the second time this year. \u201cHowever, business confidence remained subdued, as concerns about policies and market conditions persisted, and their willingness to replenish stocks remained limited. This is a major constraint on economic recovery, which requires continuous policy support. Currently, manufacturing investment may be lingering near a recent bottom. A low inventory level has lasted for a long time. If trade negotiations between China and the U.S. can progress in the next phase and business confidence can be repaired effectively, manufacturing production and investment is likely to see a solid improvement.\u201d But...Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics is cautious, telling clients: \u201cThe improvement last month was driven by different factors across the two manufacturing indices, making it hard to pinpoint the reason for the apparent uptick industrial activity,\u201d \u201cWe doubt this marks the start of a decisive rebound in activity. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A new month means a new healthcheck on the world\u2019s manufacturing sector.... and welcome signs of improvement from China. But Europe, and the UK, may continue to struggle. Growth at Chinese factories has hit a three-year high in November, according to the latest healthcheck from Caixin/Markit. Companies reported a \u201csolid increase\u201d in both output and new business last month, including a pick-up in orders from overseas. This suggests that the shock of the US-China trade war may be fading. The survey says: New business rose strongly, which underpinned a further solid increase in production. Notably, new export orders saw the first back-to-back monthly rise for over a year-and-a-half. Bosses also reported that they have stopped slashing staffing levels: Staffing levels were broadly stable following a seven-month sequence of decline, but capacity pressures persisted, with backlogs of work expanding again. This pushed the Caixin China manufacturing PMI up to 51.8, up from 51.7, which is its highest level in three years. Any reading over 50 shows growth. Here are the key points: Solid increases in output and new business Employment broadly stable Inflationary pressures remain weak Confusingly, there\u2019s also a separate official Chinese factory PMI, released last weekend. It also showed a rise in output (up to 50.2, from 49.3), bolstering hopes that manufacturers are resisting trade tensions. Reaction to follow.... Also coming up today New PMI data from the eurozone, and the UK, will show whether their factories are still struggling. Last month\u2019s \u2018flash\u2019 PMI readings showed that Britain\u2019s manufacturing was contracting in November, so today\u2019s data could be a disappointment. The European Central Bank\u2019s new president, Christine Lagarde, is testifying to the European Parliament. Expect questions about Europe\u2019s weak growth, the ECB\u2019s stimulus programme, and its plans to fight the climate emergency. The agenda 9am GMT: Eurozone manufacturing PMI for November.
