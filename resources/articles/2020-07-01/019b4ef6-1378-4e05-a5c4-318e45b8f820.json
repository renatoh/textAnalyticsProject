Millard Scott, 62, fell down some stairs and lost consciousness after being shot with a Taser during a raid by five officers on his home in Tottenham, north London. Police were looking for someone else connected to the address and part of the incident was captured on a short video that was put out by Scott\u2019s son, the artist Wretch 32. The dramatic video of the incident in June was released in the wake of Black Lives Matter protests and was referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct. On Wednesday the Met\u2019s deputy commissioner, Sir Stephen House, said the IOPC had effectively exonerated the officers involved. However, the police watchdog said it had in fact decided not to investigate after Scott\u2019s family refused to cooperate with the IOPC. Stafford Scott, brother of Millard, said: \u201cMy family will never go to the IOPC because we don\u2019t believe they are independent or competent or able to hold the police to account. We will take it to the courts because ironically they are more independent than the IOPC.\u201d Scott said his brother was still suffering: \u201cHe\u2019s still limping afterwards and in pain.\u201d Appearing before the London assembly\u2019s police and crime committee, House said: \u201cI guarantee you, that judgment from the IOPC will not get the same level of publicity as the calling in did. \u201cWhich means that the officers, who the IOPC basically are saying didn\u2019t do anything wrong, have been castigated in social media, and indeed the mainstream media, and will now get no apologies from anyone, for simply doing their job for using force in a proportionate manner. That\u2019s what I object to. And that also is very difficult for the officers to take.\u201d The IOPC on Thursday told the Guardian that the absence of a complaint from Millard Scott and him not providing evidence of serious injury, meant they had no role. Thus, the IOPC said, they had not investigated nor exonerated the officers. \u201cIn the absence of evidence of serious injury, we did not investigate this matter so did not determine whether or not the officers involved had a case to answer for breaching professional standards,\u201d they said. The IOPC added that they would reconsider if evidence of serious injury or a complaint was received. The Met said its own assessment showed no wrongdoing by the officers. It said: \u201cA 22-year-old man inside the address was arrested and later charged with encouraging another to commit an offence under the Serious Crime Act 2007. \u201cA 52-year-old woman was also arrested at the scene on suspicion of obstructing/resisting a police constable in the execution of duties but was de-arrested at the scene. She was subsequently charged with the offence after being interviewed by police under caution at a later date. \u201cAs officers entered the premises, a man came downstairs and started moving towards an officer suddenly. He was ordered to remain where he was but continued towards officers who, after several warnings, deployed a Taser. \u201cThe man was not arrested, but was assessed by the London ambulance service at the scene. He did not require further medical treatment.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
