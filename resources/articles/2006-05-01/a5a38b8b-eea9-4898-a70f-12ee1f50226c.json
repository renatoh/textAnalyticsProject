It is only a few months since Canongate published Margaret Atwood's The Penelopiad, a brilliantly funny and sardonic version of the Odysseus stories seen from Penelope's angle, and told through the incorporeal mouth of her shade in Hades with the benefit of 3,000 years of hindsight. And last year unveiled Cold Calls, the latest slim volume of Christopher Logue's \"account\" of the Iliad, his constantly astonishing splatter-poem, which has been agglomerating for nearly 50 years now. Faber has dubbed his latest volume Logue's Homer, which is a nice conceit, since it simultaneously pays homage to the way that Logue has fashioned his own Homer and puts it on a pedestal alongside Chapman's and Pope's. Faber has, in fact, something of a corner in renovated Homers. It also published (in 1993) Derek Walcott's virtuosic and marvellously theatrical play The Odyssey - a title which might seem rather hubristic if the emphasis were on the \"The\", without the small-letters gloss \"A Stage Version\". One can see that \"Armitage's Odyssey\" would not have the same punch as \"Logue's Homer\", but to entitle this mini-version as Homer's Odyssey, no more no less, takes dubious advantage of Homer's incapacity to be \"identified as the author of this work in accordance with\" etc. For this is not a translation of Homer in any sense, nor, except through its title, does it pretend to be. It is true that, unlike the Walcott and Atwood, which are elaborate recastings in another form, Armitage closely follows the story sequence as set out in The (Homer's) Odyssey; but it is radically reduced and simplified into short and swiftly intercutting scenes, to produce a kind of dramatised pr\u00e9cis of selected scenes of the Homeric epic. There is no narrator and hardly any sustained speeches, so a lot of rapid dialogue has to be devised. The result is proportionately much bigger \"parts\" for Odysseus' crewmen and for Penelope's suitors, along with multiplied \"interludes\" from Zeus and Athena on Olympus, and Alcinous and Nausicaa on Phaeacia. In Homer, the climactic day on which Odysseus finally faces and defeats the suitors lasts for four whole books (out of 24): in Armitage it is all over in 15 small pages, with six of them spent on stringing the bow (or \"lacing\" it, as this version has it). It seems in a hurry to get it all safely over. Armitage belongs to the rattling good yarn school of Homeric retellings. There is little here to complicate or slow down or distract or question. Take the scene in which Odysseus and his young son Telemachus kill the disloyal, promiscuous maidservants, hanging them from a kind of washing line in the palace-yard - \"for a while their feet flailed, but not for long ...\". This episode has fascinated and repelled both Walcott and Atwood (and also Michael Longley in a powerful poem called \"The Butchers\"). In Atwood the Maids, who form a kind of Greek chorus, were secretly loyal to Penelope, but falsely condemned by the old busy-body nurse Eurykleia. In Walcott, Penelope, echoing WB Yeats, forbids Odysseus \"to make this a second Troy\", adding \"When will men learn?\". In Armitage the whole incident is simply suppressed, censored. This is an Odyssey without discomfort. Armitage is a poet, and his version is in verse, or at least mostly. It is not any particular metric or musicality that marks it as \"not-prose\", but diction. While Homer, rich in similes, is sparse with what we call metaphors, Armitage slips them in whenever one happens to cross his mind: \"Months at sea had turned their fingers to rope / and their thoughts to salt\", \"Every nerve in my body vibrates in orgasm\", that sort of thing. Like the narrative itself, the language dashes along, intent on getting through the story without overtaxing anyone's attention span. This is not epic, nor (unlike Walcott) is it epic theatre: it is more like an adaptation for a teenage drama workshop - and as such it is pretty good. This is not a surge-and-thunder Odyssey, crashing its breakers on a rugged Aegean coast, it is more like a big swimming-pool complex with a wave-machine. And you can have a lot of fun with a wave-machine. So what, finally, might Homer's shade down in Atwood's far from elysian fields of asphodel think of Simon Armitage? He would surely be happy to have his poem of the man of many twists and turns told in yet another form. The lost royalties mean nothing to him; and he can rest assured about which Homer's Odyssey will last for longer. \u00b7 Oliver Taplin is a fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, and author of Homeric Soundings: The Shaping of the Iliad (Clarendon Press).
