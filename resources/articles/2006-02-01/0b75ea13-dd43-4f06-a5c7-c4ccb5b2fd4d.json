Not the most comforting words to hear from a car-hire rep but, as Dan and I left Havana, we thought it'd be fine. It was our first holiday as a couple and we wanted an adventure. It was lunchtime and our drive to the town of Vinales looked an easy jaunt. According to the map, we just took one of the main roads out of Havana and we'd be there, right? Wrong. Cuban roads feature painted billboard messages of comradeship, but no road signs. By the time I knew we were lost, we were so lost I had no idea where we were. Eventually a policeman directed us. 'The map was wrong,' I growled. 'You couldn't be wrong, could you?' sighed Dan. 'Maybe this whole trip is wrong,' I retorted. We drove in silence as the sun dipped below the hills. The potholed road swarmed with locals trying to hitchhike home. Fine - but did they have to stand in the fast lane? Donkeys and bicycles mingled with the cars. It was good to see this before the sun set: there were no lights on the road, so once night fell we could only see to the end of our headlights. We made it to our hotel in time for dinner, and made up in time for dessert. \u00b7 Do you have a memorable journey?
