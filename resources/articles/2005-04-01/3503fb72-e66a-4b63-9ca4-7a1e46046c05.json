She is going yellower by the day, but hanging on grimly. Another friend definitely has cancer and another friend, only my age, has suspected cancer. Cancer everywhere. \"Three out of four get it,\" says a nurse breezily. What a fright. Who will be next? Where is it secretly brewing? We are not mentioning the C-word to my mother. Why bother? She is scared to death of it. Her mother died of it, her brother died of it and her sister died of it, horribly. Why give her a dreadful fright, when we don't officially know? She is too old and weedy to be sent to a hospital for tests, so we all hang about, waiting and wondering. Meanwhile, the dog has an odd lump on its chest, its friend has a big lump on its gum, Sylvia has an odd stomach ache, I have a strange cough and several hundred moles, some of which sometimes feel peculiar, and then, chilling news, Daughter also spots a tiny lump on her gum. Every pain or blemish now gives me a fright. I dare not check, because it is usually late at night when I think about checking mole changes or lumps, then what if I find one? I'll have to sweat all night by myself thinking of death and not be able to alert the doctor till morning. But in the morning one doesn't think of these things. Other things are happening. For a start, my bedroom wall is being painted yellow. It had some blotches and needed redoing. It already was yellow, now it's yellower. But suddenly the yellow doesn't look lovely and sunny anymore. It is a nasty message from a fading liver. Why did I not change it when I had the chance? Then suddenly my mother perks up again. \"What's the matter with me?\" she asks. \"Your liver isn't working properly.\" And she is also 99, but I shan't remind her. She requests some ice-cream and ginger sauce. She eats it. She drinks an entire cup of tea. Nothing hurts. She looks better than yesterday, God knows how. Then some marvellous news. Daughter's lump has gone. It was a false alarm, and Olivia reminds me that several more friends have all had cancer, recovered and are still here. But at 99 the outlook is probably not so rosy. More yellow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
