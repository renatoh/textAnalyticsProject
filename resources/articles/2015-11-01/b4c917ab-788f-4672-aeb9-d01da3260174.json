Not that there appears any immediate rush: the adulation bestowed upon Michael O\u2019Neill and his history-makers shows no sign of abating. Given what had come immediately before, this was a positively low-key success to round off 2015. But success it was, in the latest positive occasion between a management team, group of players and fanbase who are revelling in the here and now. In seven months\u2019 time, that terrific brand of logic which manifests itself in football will have Northern Ireland believing they can conquer the best in this continent. Who can reasonably deny them that? \u201cIt has been a great year, we have had a great campaign and it is important to recognise the achievements of this team,\u201d said O\u2019Neill. \u201cThat\u2019s eight games unbeaten, we had another clean sheet; it is all positive. \u201c It is important that the players realised what got them to this position: belief, work-rate, confidence. They tuned into that and understood that. They didn\u2019t go flat.\u201d There was never any doubt that Latvia would be swatted aside at Windsor Park, with only the slim margin of victory of possible annoyance to O\u2019Neill. \u201cIt could have been more,\u201d said the manager with more than a hint of understatement. Far, far tougher tests lie in wait \u2013 Latvia offered absolutely nothing of attacking consequence \u2013 but Northern Ireland are still entitled to revel in a gloriously positive football tale. A glance at the teams from which O\u2019Neill compiles squads offers a glowing reflection of his work. The first glimpse of planning for next summer in France came by way of O\u2019Neill\u2019s team set-up. He broke with recent history by deploying a back three; an experiment that made perfect sense given Craig Cathcart, Gareth McAuley and Jonny Evans all hold down regular places in England\u2019s top flight. Given qualifying success, O\u2019Neill could readily have dodged this international window. Perhaps he believed his players worthy of further plaudits from supporters who have seen constant disappointment replaced by giddy excitement. Home friendly matches, after all, haven\u2019t been a fixture of O\u2019Neill\u2019s tenure at all. Latvia always looked favourable opponents. They finished bottom of Group A with five points \u2013 and not a single win \u2013 from 10 games. Marian Pahars, renowned for occasional magic when a player at Southampton, will require an identical touch if afforded further time to turn around his national team\u2019s fortunes. The hosts\u2019 start was unsurprisingly bright. Steven Davis, typically, was the fulcrum for everything positive about Northern Ireland\u2019s play. A sublime pass to Kyle Lafferty should have ensured an opening goal on the half-hour mark but the striker never appeared confident when clean through and duly pulled his attempt wide. Evans missed an equally fine opportunity in the seconds before the interval, the West Brom central defender\u2019s header bouncing past the left-hand post of Andris Vanins. Such wastefulness, needless to say, has not been a feature of Northern Ireland when it counts. Lafferty, who has emerged as a talisman for his country despite a chequered time at club level, forced Vanins into a smart save within five minutes of the restart as O\u2019Neill\u2019s team pressed further for the goal their dominance deserved. Lafferty, who has little to prove on the international scene at least, lasted only another nine minutes before the rejuvenated Kilmarnock striker Josh Magennis took his place. Lafferty was en route to the shower when Davis broke the deadlock in what was a fitting reward for the midfielder\u2019s performance. Cathcart was the unlikely architect, with a swinging cross which his captain met at the back post. Davis needed two attempts but still managed to beat Vanins to trigger merely the latest round of Windsor Park celebrations. The raft of substitutions which so undermine these matches was to follow. The loudest appreciation arrived for Davis as the mercurial Paddy McCourt appeared in his place. For all these alterations punctured the game, the incessant flow of traffic towards the Latvia goal was never stemmed. But there was to be no second goal. The closest to it arriving was via Vitalijs Maksimenko, who shanked a clearance perilously close to his own net. The extent to which O\u2019Neill opts to test his squad in terms of friendly opposition before Euro 2016 will prove a matter of intrigue. As qualifying group winners, Northern Ireland have earned the right to be picky. They are also riding the crest of a confidence wave; Latvia were never likely to do any harm to that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
