The two broadcasters, who will share live coverage of the tournament under their deal with the European Broadcasting Union, have split up the group stages and will show 24 games from June 12-23. ITV's plum tie is on June 13 and it will be hoping the audience comes close to those of recent years. The 2002 World Cup defeat against Brazil, broadcast simultaneously by BBC and ITV, was watched by 16m despite kicking off in the morning, and England's first match that summer, against Sweden and on ITV only, was watched by 12.6m. The commercial network will also show England's second game in Euro 2004, against Switzerland on June 17, leaving the BBC with only one group game - against Croatia on June 21 - although the payback would come in the quarter- final, where England are likely to face Portugal or Spain. Both channels will show the semi-finals and final simultaneously. \u0095 Sven-Goran Eriksson and the FA's executive director David Davies meet Premier League chairmen today to present their case for a winter break in English football."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
