Workers\u2019 rights have failed to keep pace with the dismantling of the nine-to-five working week as Britain\u2019s gig economy has more than doubled in size over three years to account for 4.7 million workers, the TUC has warned, in a study conducted with the University of Hertfordshire. \u201cHuge numbers are being forced to take on casual and insecure platform work \u2013 often on top of other jobs,\u201d said Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress. \u201cBut as we\u2019ve seen with Uber too often these workers are denied their rights and are treated like disposable labour.\u201d Overall employment in the UK has reached a record 32.75 million following a boom in job creation since the 2008 financial crisis. But economists believe employment is also increasingly precarious, putting pressure on living standards. Poverty while in work has increased, alongside the use of food banks, and average wages after inflation remain below the level recorded before the 2008 crash. The government promised to boost workers\u2019 rights after a landmark review of the gig economy but Brexit has left that process stalled, and unions and Labour say the measures do not go far enough. * * * Democratic debate vol. 2 \u2013 An exchange on race rattled frontrunner Joe Biden as 10 more Democratic presidential candidates clashed in Miami on Thursday night. Biden squared up against the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders but they were overshadowed by strong performances from other candidates. California senator Kamala Harris raised questions over Biden\u2019s approach to racial issues after he made a remark recently on the campaign trail speaking fondly of his relationship with segregationist senators. \u201cThat is a mischaracterisation of my position across the board. I did not praise racists,\u201d Biden responded. Sanders called Donald Trump a \u201cpathological liar\u201d who conned American workers and said the best way to beat Trump was to \u201cexpose him for the fraud that he is\u201d. It was also a big night for Pete Buttigieg, who has soared from near-anonymity to the top of the Democratic field but has faced sharp criticism for his handling as mayor of South Bend, Indiana, of a fatal shooting of a black man by a white police officer. * * * G20 under way \u2013 Theresa May is expected to press Vladimir Putin over the novichok attack in Salisbury, and the Russian agents suspected of carrying it out, when she meets with him today. Vladimir Putin has said in an FT interview that western liberalism is \u201cobsolete \u2026 It has come into conflict with the interests of the overwhelming majority of the population\u201d. The European council president Donald Tusk hit back sharply this morning: \u201cWhoever claims that liberal democracy is obsolete, also claims that freedoms are obsolete, that the rule of law is obsolete and that human rights are obsolete. What I find really obsolete are: authoritarianism, personality cults, the rule of oligarchs. Even if sometimes they may seem effective.\u201d Donald Trump and Xi Jinping have been urged to reach a trade deal for the sake of the global economy as world leaders gather in Japan. * * * Windrush warnings were ignored \u2013 The Home Office failed in its legal duty to counter racial discrimination when it implemented its anti-immigration hostile environment programme, a draft investigation into the causes of the Windrush scandal has reportedly found. \u201cThis appears particularly reckless considering the significant warnings that the department was given about their potential consequences,\u201d says the draft report, seen by Channel 4 News. As a result of Theresa May\u2019s hostile environment policy, thousands of people who had lived legally in the UK for decades found themselves wrongly classified as illegal immigrants. * * * Shock over Alabama case \u2013 A woman who was shot in the stomach while pregnant, killing the foetus, has been charged with its manslaughter. Police in Alabama say the charge is justified because Marshae Jones, 27, started the fight with the shooter, who remains free. Alabama is one of 38 states with foetal homicide laws that recognise a foetus as a potential victim. It is also a \u201cstand-your-ground\u201d state where people can use physical force to defend themselves if their reason is \u201cjustifiable\u201d. The Alabama governor, Kay Ivey, signed a bill in May banning abortion in almost every circumstance \u2013 including rape and incest. Jones\u2019s case has raised alarm among pro-choice groups, who say it is shocking evidence of how the abortion laws are being used against pregnant women. * * * \u2018Dutch auction of chaos\u2019 \u2013 The announcement of the new Tory leader is still three weeks away. Just leaving that there \u2026 in Brexit developments Boris Johnson has refused to categorically rule out suspending parliament in order to let Britain crash out of the EU without a deal. On the hustings in Bournemouth, Johnson\u2019s rival, Jeremy Hunt, pledged to resign as prime minister if he did not manage to \u201cdeliver Brexit and deliver it very quickly\u201d. Simon Jenkins writes this morning that Johnson\u2019s hard Brexit is \u201cbased on a legal fantasy, that under World Trade Organisation rules you can have an agreement without a deal. Hunt, meanwhile, feels obliged to repeat May\u2019s \u2018no deal is better than a bad deal\u2019 mantra. This Dutch auction of chaos is cheered on by Tory party members \u2026 Every indication now is that May\u2019s withdrawal deal is the only conceivable way of achieving a 31 October Brexit.\u201d * * * \u2018Gambling with lives\u2019 \u2013 The parents of Jack Ritchie, a gambling addict who killed himself aged 24, have launched a legal bid to hold the government liable. Charles and Liz Ritchie want the inquest into his death to take into account article 2 of the European convention on human rights \u2013 the right to life. It would consider whether the government failed to protect Jack from risk. \u201cOver many years they failed to regulate gambling, educate the public about the health risks or make adequate treatment resources available to people who suffer harm,\u201d said Charles and Liz Ritchie, who founded the charity Gambling With Lives after Jack\u2019s death. The Sheffield coroner, Christopher Dorries, is due to hear arguments from the Ritchies\u2019 lawyers today. The Gambling Commission and the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, which oversees gambling policy, are opposing the move. * * * I\u2019ve a new idea, Tim \u2013 Jony Ive, the British designer of the iMac, iPod, iPhone and Apple Watch, is to leave Apple after 30 years to set up his own creative company. \u201cThis just seems like a natural and gentle time to make this change,\u201d he said. Ive worked on the original Apple PowerBook 140, released in 1991, while still employed at UK design firm Tangerine. His first true hit with Apple was the 1998 iMac with its translucent \u201cBondi blue\u201d casing. Starting in 2012, he took over design of Apple\u2019s software, which resulted in a total overhaul of the iPhone\u2019s operating system, iOS. He was also involved in designing Apple\u2019s new headquarters, Apple Park, the $5bn futuristic \u201cspaceship\u201d that opened in 2017. Today in Focus podcast: Did the Saudis get away with Khashoggi? A UN report on the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi has said there is credible evidence linking the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, to the crime. Nick Hopkins and Stephanie Kirchgaessner discuss the killing and the fallout in Saudi Arabia and among its allies.

Business Concerns about the outlook for the global economy have dominated the opening stages of the G20 summit in Osaka, with world leaders lining up to call on the US and China to reach an agreement on their festering trade dispute. Russian president Vladimir Putin and Indian PM Narendra Modi issued veiled warnings against \u201csome countries\u201d trying to upset the balance of world trade. The fighting talk gave investors in Asia the jitters, led by stocks in Shanghai which were down nearly 1%. The FTSE100 looks like following it down\u2013 but only by a fraction. The pound will buy you $1.267 and \u20ac1.115. The papers The FT quotes its exclusive interview with Vladimir Putin on its front: \u201cThe liberal idea has become obsolete\u201d.
