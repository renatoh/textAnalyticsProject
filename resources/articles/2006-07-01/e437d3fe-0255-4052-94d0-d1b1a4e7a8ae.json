I need to transfer some database files created in Novell's PerfectWorks 2.1, an ancient program that has always catered for my database needs. It doesn't work properly under XP. Nick Steinitz Jack Schofield replies: You have violated Schofield's First Law, which says you should never put data into a program unless you can see how to get it out. PCs and programs are cheap and transitory but data is expensive to create and, potentially, lasts forever. You say you've tried XP's compatibility mode, so your best bet is to somehow load the data into PerfectWorks then save it in a recognised format, such as xbase (dBase) or, if all else fails, CSV (comma separated variables) that a more modern program will read. If you can no longer load Perfect Works, your last chance is to try Dataviz's Conversions Plus (http://tinyurl.com/6iik), which includes a database translator for PerfectWorks 2.1. This must be considered a fortunate result. Novell sold PerfectWorks (formerly from WordPerfect) to Arkose Software in 1999, which sold version 3 as ArkoseWorks before going out of business. The fact that an old program caters perfectly adequately to your needs is no excuse for using it. You need to make sure your data is in an open standard file format, for preference, or at least a de facto (widely supported) standard format. Here endeth the sermon! CD player Can you recommend a free, simple, downloadable CD player for Windows? Stanley Russell JS: Stick an audio CD into a PC and Windows will play it, which is as simple as it gets. However, CDmax is a simple CD player that downloads artist/title/track information from the Freedb CD database and saves it on your hard drive. It used to be freeware, but now it's shareware (http://tinyurl.com/nroeh). Suspicious cookie I am suspicious about a cookie from reporting.tvlicensing.co.uk. Is my TV card squealing on me? Paul Stamp JS: No. TV Licensing says it uses cookies \"to gauge use of our website and measure response to our publicity and site usage\". You'll get its persistent cookie (needed to fill in forms, etc) by going to the site, and probably a tracking cookie from any web page that displays one of its banner advertisements. Monitor problem My Windows 98 is running satisfactorily except that the screen has shrunk slightly, with the two vertical sides slightly concave towards the centre. I restored to before the fault appeared but it made no difference. Bryden Keenan JS: Check the controls on the monitor: there should be a button or wheel setting for pincushion or \"trapezoid correction\". That should correct the problem. However, the monitor may be aging. According to Samuel M Goldwasser's invaluable monitor repair FAQ (http:// tinyurl.com/ae63z), reduced width could be caused by a failing capacitor. Latest XP I plan to re-build my PC and re-install XP Home with SP2, but only have an XP CD and a separate SP2 disc. I'd like to get an install CD with SP2 included. Kevin Mansell JS: Sorry, it seems Microsoft doesn't offer that, unless you buy a new copy of Windows. It is still happy to supply SP2 on disc for \u00a36, but you already have one. People who don't can order one from http://tinyurl.com/6tmxj or by calling 0870 60 10 100. Backchat \u00b7 Ann Perrott's iPod broke after four months. Steven Robinson says his first 40GB Click Wheel iPod lasted 11 months but its replacement stopped working after eight. Tim Davies says: \"I have had four iPods. They kept breaking and PC World kept on replacing them. Eventually I got the money back and bought a PlayStation Portable.\" Kathy Fowler's iPod stopped holding a charge after 10 months but \"these things happen, and Apple's service was second to none\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
