One week after that record 43-5 humiliation in Sydney, Australia chipped away at their trans-Tasman rivals in Brisbane, leading, then conceding, and eventually outlasting a team that had seven days ago consigned them to a harrowing place indeed. The 24-22 result was as close numerically as it was in balance of play, and full-time beckoned for the Australians long before they heard the sweet sound of the final whistle. The boot of Reece Hodge had squeezed Dave Rennie\u2019s side into a 17-15 lead with 10 minutes remaining at Suncorp Stadium, before Taniela Tupou ran over in the 75th minute and Hodge added the extras for a nine-point buffer. Had they had a say, the Wallabies would have stopped the count there. But the All Blacks are known for gaining key territory in tight contests, and made no exception here when Tupou Vaa\u2019i scored his first Test try with a minute on the clock. Jordie Barrett\u2019s conversion closed the deficit to two points, and there the scoreboard stood as a standpost of Rennie\u2019s first win since succeeding Michael Cheika as coach. Saturday night\u2019s fourth Test was a textbook contradiction of a dead rubber, a chaotic thriller that finished with 14 men apiece after referee Nic Berry showed two red cards in line with rugby\u2019s high-tackle rules designed to minimise head injuries. Both hosts and visitors were depleted before half-time, as promising Wallabies debutant Lachie Swinton followed All Blacks forward Ofa Tu\u2019ungafasi to the sheds for near-identical high tackles. Replays showed Tu\u2019ungafasi had hit Tom Wright \u2013 who scored the opening try with his first touch of a Test football \u2013 on the chin. With no mitigating factors, Berry gave the marching orders. It should have provided a pivotal advantage, but the Wallabies\u2019 failure to sufficiently capitalise allowed New Zealand to match Hodge\u2019s early penalty \u2013 Noah Lolesio\u2019s replacement at five-eighth kicked four penalties for a total five from seven. They took that 8-8 scoreline into half-time with 13 players on the field. The first to go was Swinton, who replicated Tu\u2019ungafasi\u2019s hit with a challenge on Sam Whitelock to earn a red card of his own. Both Rennie and Wallabies captain Michael Hooper accepted Swinton\u2019s dismissal. \u201cWe don\u2019t train to tackle around the head and we have to talk about player safety ... we want players playing as long as we possibly can in this game,\u201d Hooper said. \u201cIf that\u2019s the interpretation from up top, we\u2019ve got to be better and tackle lower.\u201d Then, winger Marika Koroibete was yellow-carded for a line-ball penalty deemed the final straw following repeated infringements. Nonetheless, they defied their short-term shortage after the break, and Hodge\u2019s penalty converted early pressure into an 11-8 lead. It was all too fleeting. All Blacks hooker Codie Taylor scored off the back of the scrum from the restart and an immediate reply went begging when Nic White fumbled Wright\u2019s inside pass. Hodge then missed a penalty from 50m but the Wallabies continued to press, and New Zealand\u2019s Scott Barrett was sin-binned for a professional foul. He did not miss another from in front, though, slotting a curtain-raiser for Tupou\u2019s next act. Vaa\u2019i had been foraging for late sustenance, and his try fashioned a sliver of hope for Ian Foster\u2019s outfit. Koroibete put that idea to bed via a flying hit on Damian McKenzie, to restore some pride after a 2-1 series loss featuring one win, one draw and two defeats. \u201cWe said we wanted a response after last weekend and we got it,\u201d Rennie said post-match. \u201cHodgey kicked pretty well and we got our noses in front. We\u2019ve got a long way to go \u2013 we\u2019re going to get much better \u2013 But it\u2019s good to get a result like this. It helps to get a bit of belief.\u201d James Slipper left his 100th Test early with an arm injury."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
