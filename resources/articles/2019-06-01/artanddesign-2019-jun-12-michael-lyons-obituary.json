Living first in Pocklington, north Yorkshire, and later at Cawood, near Selby, he was one of the group of artists who developed successful careers from a non-metropolitan base. Such strength of mind was the driving force that Michael and others, principally Peter Murray, engaged to create the Yorkshire Sculpture Park in 1977. During meetings with Michael in my role as a gallery curator, I remember his characteristic pose, hand to chin, looking, listening, not saying much, but perhaps also quite reasonably wondering why it was that so many young artists rushed off to London, and lost immediate connection with land and sky. It is this vision that Michael instinctively wound into his sculpture, while Yorkshire also gave him \u201cthe freedom to cut metal and smoke cigars\u201d. Michael was born in Bilston, West Midlands. His father, George, a bicycle shop owner, died shortly before his birth; his mother, Ethel, later took a job as assistant to a dispensing chemist. After youthful training for the Roman Catholic priesthood, Michael studied at Wolverhampton College of Art, then Newcastle University, and later taught sculpture at art colleges. In 1974 he joined the staff of Manchester Polytechnic (now Manchester Metropolitan University), where he was head of sculpture (1989-93). In the 1980s and 90s he travelled to Alberta and China to study and to teach. He was sensitive to the grandeur of the Canadian landscape and its antiquity, and, as Judith LeGrove expresses it in her book The Sculpture of Michael Lyons (2013), he \u201cretained the imprint of an acute sense of place: immense skies with eagles, croaking frogs in wetlands, the prairie wind lifting soil\u201d. The visit to China led Michael to conclude that many Chinese students were attuned to abstract sculpture because \u201cearly education in calligraphy was not far removed from the manipulation of form in space, where negative is as important as positive\u201d. Michael created a life\u2019s work, in public and private collections including those of the Arts Council, the Hepworth Wakefield, the Jerwood Foundation and the Yale Centre for British Art, that brought to sculpture a poetry and an acknowledgment of the powers both of nature and of ritual. He was an artist who discovered and expressed, again in LeGrove\u2019s words, \u201cthe quiver of life within\u201d. An exhibition of his work at York Art Gallery is due to run until May next year. Michael is survived by his wife, Stephanie (nee Kay), whom he married in 1970, and their children, David and Anna."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
