However, Alexander is far from losing her passion \u2013 in fact, she is looking beyond the world of netball. \u201cThere are also opportunities in other sports and particularly for me, AFL,\u201d she tells Guardian Australia. \u201cPeople ask me about AFLW. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m suited for that kind of coaching, because it\u2019s much more at a development level. I don\u2019t say that with any sort of malice\u2026for the longevity of the competition it needs development coaches who can lift the skill levels\u2026It\u2019s happening quickly but that\u2019s not my skill set.\u201d Alexander has her sights firmly set on the men\u2019s competition, where she believes she could add value to a number of teams, particularly the bottom six from this year. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought I could add to the defensive knowledge because while they have embraced the cluster, I think a lot of the one-on-one contests and the coaching of that fine art of the defence in those contests, I think I can add a lot to,\u201d she says. \u201cAlso in the midfield the way the stoppages work, the different setups in our play are similar. In the attacking structure I\u2019m seeing teams like Richmond now starting to look at that creation of space first and then driving to the attacking space.\u201d Alexander has been around football her whole life, attending St Kilda matches with her mother from the age of four and achieving a level three coaching qualification in the sport while at university. Growing up she did not understand why she wasn\u2019t allowed to play football or cricket, two sports she loved to play in the backyard and around her neighbourhood. At that time, girls simply did not play those sports and Alexander is pleased that has changed for today\u2019s young people. While there is a significant barrier to break through to become the first female head coach of a men\u2019s AFL team, Alexander takes aim at critics who suggest she should set her sights lower. \u201cPeople always say to me, \u2018Oh, you should start at the bottom and work your way up\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cWell, would you say that to the CEO of BHP? If they went across to Macquarie Bank, would they have to go to the bottom of the pile there? I mean, it\u2019s absurd. But that\u2019s the sort of argument I have to put together for people who don\u2019t understand.\u201d While male coaches in women\u2019s sport are common \u2013 there have even been two male head coaches in the Super Netball \u2013 if Alexander was to achieve her dream, she would become the first female head coach of a professional men\u2019s team in any of the football codes in Australia. While she does not find that idea daunting, she recognises that there are dangers that come with being the first. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be somebody that takes the leap of faith to say, we\u2019re going to have a go at this. And we\u2019re going to back it and we\u2019re going to put in a team,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat happened to Rhyce Shaw this year [who took a team into a hub as a first year coach without a full support system around him], if that happens to the first female AFL head coach then of course they\u2019ll fail. Because they are on a hiding to nothing.\u201d Alexander has taken on a part-time role as high performance coaching and leadership expert with Leading Teams, but as well as considering a role in AFL, she has been keeping a keen eye on the opportunities that have cropped up in the Super Netball \u2013 the Queensland Firebirds and Collingwood Magpies are both yet to name new coaches for the 2021 season, while West Coast Fever head coach Stacey Marinkovich will move into a full-time position with the Diamonds in 2022. \u201cI haven\u2019t quite got the coaching bug out of me yet,\u201d she says. \u201cWatching the grand finals [in Super Netball, AFL and NRL] makes me think about that urgency and the thrill of coaching in a high-performance environment and how addictive it is. And working with young people\u2026it\u2019s a great love.\u201d Alexander acknowledges the tough journey ahead if she does set off down the path of AFL coaching, but she feels that it is important to take a chance on a big dream and set an example for younger women who want to pursue an elite coaching career. \u201cThe only thing I see is the fact that we\u2019re excluded, and it doesn\u2019t make sense to me, because you\u2019re excluding 50% of your talent pool of coaching,\u201d she says. \u201cWhy would you do it? So it\u2019s about modelling and people like me having to show the way. It may not happen for me. But even if I just paved the way for it to happen, I\u2019ll be feeling very, very pleased about that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
