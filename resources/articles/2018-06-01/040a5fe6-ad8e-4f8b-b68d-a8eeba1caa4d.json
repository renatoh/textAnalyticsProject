Staring at \u2013 practically hypnotised by \u2013 the float, a little orange stick in the water, willing it to twitch. And then, when it does, that magical moment, not quite believing it. Did it really happen, or did I imagine it? It twitches again, bobs down and goes under. You pick up the rod and strike. Yes! Resistance, a connection via a thin nylon thread to a fish. We\u2019re in. It is a childhood memory: I don\u2019t do fishing much these days, but I know that if I went again, it would come rushing back, that heart-quickening thrill, interspersed by long periods of very little. \u201cThere were so many things, Paul, that we loved and we don\u2019t bother doing any more,\u201d says Bob Mortimer to his friend Paul Whitehouse. \u201cDrugs,\u201d says Paul, quick as a flash. \u201cDrugs, for example,\u201d agrees Bob. Also other things, including fishing. They\u2019re on the edge of a pond in Norfolk; Paul has brought his old pal Bob here in search of an elusive member of the carp family called a tench. Both have recently had heart ops: Paul had stents fitted, Bob a triple bypass (\u201cA more senior operation,\u201d he boasts). Later he shows Paul his scar, a dotted line up his front like a zipper. Bob Mortimer, human beanbag. No drugs these days, then, apart from ones that make hearts go slower and blood run thinner, perhaps. And no biscuits. \u201cThe problem is when you\u2019ve got heart disease, as you have, and I have, you can\u2019t just reach endlessly for biscuits, can you, for comfort?\u201d says Paul. \u201cBig gap in your life, when they take cheese from you, biscuits from you,\u201d Bob replies. \u201cWhat do you reach out to? A nut?\u201d \u201cTherapist.\u201d \u201cA magazine.\u201d No tench today, either. And that\u2019s probably no bad thing, their tickers might not stand up to the excitement of a bobbing float. And it allows them to reflect on mortality, to be funny and to be together. What historical figure would Bob\u2019s ideal fishing companion be, Paul wonders. \u201cI don\u2019t know much about history,\u201d says Bob. \u201cWhat about trigonometry?\u201d says Paul, again quick as a flash. Bob doesn\u2019t know much about trigonometry either. No, Paul meant the song, Bob knows he did \u2026 I think Bob Mortimer\u2019s ideal fishing companion is Paul Whitehouse. And neither is history just yet. They spend a night in a yurt. In \u2013 although not entirely convinced by \u2013 a yurt. Two yurts, in fact; there comes a time in life when you no longer have to share a yurt \u2026 Hang on, they\u2019re not even that old: 59 (Bob) and 60 (Paul). The following day, they go and stand by another Norfolk pond, to reflect on their own mortalities and to continue their quest for tench \u2026 The float twitches, bobs, goes under. Paul grabs the rod (he\u2019s more about the fishing; I think Bob\u2019s really just here because Paul is). Fish on! It\u2019s not a tench, though: they\u2019ve caught a bream. \u201cThey\u2019re not exactly a fighter, the bream,\u201d says Paul. You can say that again; this miserable specimen just rolls over on to its side on the surface of the water and gives up while Paul reels it towards Bob, who\u2019s waiting for it with his net. Neither of these boys did that, rolled over and gave up; they\u2019re fighting on, without biscuits. Bob actually catches a couple for himself \u2013 again, not tench, though. One is a roach, a pretty little thing (with the emphasis on little); the other a rudd, also a tiddler. But at least it\u2019s got some life in it and jumps back in on its own accord. Of course, it\u2019s not really about the fish or the fishing. It\u2019s about two funny people together somewhere you don\u2019t normally see them. It is about friendship \u2013 male friendship \u2013 and getting older and reminiscing; joking about mortality and life. Not unlike The Trip, then, with Mortimer and Whitehouse in the Coogan and Brydon roles and trying to catch fish instead of eating them in restaurants. There are even impressions: Bob, who\u2019s wearing a jacket a bit like Travis Bickle\u2019s, does his De Niro. It\u2019s fine until he starts talking and then it gets less like De Niro. Stick to silent De Niro, Bob (although, actually, a bad impression is funnier than a good one). It doesn\u2019t have the same \u201chow-much-of-this-is-real\u201d element as The Trip; this is reality rather than hyper-reality. It\u2019s more ambling and shambling. It doesn\u2019t have the tension or the feeling that you are going deep into dark places in the protagonists\u2019 souls \u2026 OK, so it\u2019s not as good as The Trip. But then not much is. This is still lovely: warm and funny and human and healthy. And, in the end, there\u2019s even a tench."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
