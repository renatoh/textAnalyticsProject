The first minister said May\u2019s stance was \u201ccompletely outrageous and unacceptable\u201d, hours after the prime minister had insisted that \u201cnow is not the time\u201d for the referendum that the SNP had hoped to stage between autumn 2019 and spring 2019. Sturgeon said on Thursday: \u201cIt\u2019s an argument for independence, really, in a nutshell, that Westminster thinks it has got the right to block the democratically elected mandate of the Scottish government and the majority in the Scottish parliament. History may look back on today and see it as the day the fate of the union was sealed.\u201d She insisted she would press on with plans for a vote at the Scottish parliament next week seeking its approval to request the legal power from Westminster to stage the referendum on Holyrood\u2019s terms \u2013 a vote she is expected to narrowly win with Scottish Green party support. But May said earlier that the Tories would not allow any discussion of the referendum until the UK\u2019s Brexit deal had been signed and Scottish voters had time to weigh it up, implying any referendum may not happen until 2021 at the earliest. \u201cTo look at the issue at this time would be unfair, because people wouldn\u2019t have the necessary information to make such a crucial decision,\u201d May added. The Tory gamble is driven by a series of opinion polls showing that a large majority of Scottish voters do not want a referendum before Brexit, even though support for independence has jumped from about 45% to nearly 50% after May spelt out her plans in January for a hard Brexit. May\u2019s blunt intervention is likely to goad SNP activists into an even more energetic independence campaign this summer as they seek to build support for a referendum, starting at the SNP\u2019s spring conference this weekend. Sturgeon predicted that May\u2019s position would soon prove to be politically unsustainable. \u201cThis is not the Iron Lady \u2013 this is someone whose government is in chaos, chopping and changing all of the time,\u201d she told BBC Reporting Scotland. UK government sources indicated on Wednesday that May would not formally respond to Sturgeon\u2019s timetable before the first minister had officially requested legal authority for a referendum, under section 30 of the Scotland Act 1998, after next week\u2019s Holyrood vote on the proposal. But that changed unexpectedly on Thursday. Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, and David Mundell, the UK government\u2019s Scottish secretary, were forced to deny that May had been persuaded to make her statement on the eve of the SNP conference to provoke its activists into taking a far more partisan stance. Mundell argued it would be discourteous to Holyrood if the UK government failed to make clear before next week\u2019s vote in the Scottish parliament that it had already decided to reject outright Sturgeon\u2019s timetable. Davidson and Mundell said that lack of appetite for an early referendum and the fact that Holyrood\u2019s five parties were split on the issue undermined Sturgeon\u2019s claim of a mandate. The SNP is currently in a minority government at Holyrood but had a substantial majority in 2012, when all five parties agreed that staging the first referendum in 2014 was justified. That was \u201ca fundamental reason why now is not the right time to take Scotland back to the precipice\u201d, Davidson said. \u201cAnd that is because there is no clear political or public consent for this to take place. The country \u2013 and our parliament \u2013 is divided not over just the question of independence, but over whether we should even hold a referendum or not.\u201d Davidson\u2019s spokesman confirmed the Tories could reverse their position if there was a substantial and sustained surge in support for independence and in demands for a referendum in the next two years. There were signs too of further movement on timing from Sturgeon\u2019s government. Pressed after May\u2019s statement about the first minister\u2019s hint earlier this week she could agree to the referendum shortly after Brexit, her spokesman said Sturgeon believed she had the right to stage it until the next Scottish elections in May 2021. He insisted Sturgeon would continue to fight for the vote to be held by spring 2019, but added that her mandate for a referendum, on the grounds that Scotland was being taken out of the EU against its will, lasted until those elections. \u201cThe first minister has made clear her preferred timescale and that is the timescale we\u2019re working to,\u201d he said. But asked if that meant a referendum could be held by 2021, he said yes, adding: \u201cThe mandate is clear \u2013 the mandate is for the parliamentary term.\u201d May\u2019s decision to resist agreeing a referendum until well after Brexit in 2019 implies it could not be held until 2021 at the earliest. It would take up to a year for both governments and both parliaments to agree and authorise a legally constituted referendum. The Electoral Commission would need up to six months to decide on a question, with another six months needed for the campaign. The prime minister is to reinforce her claims that the UK will prosper after Brexit on Friday in a speech to the Conservative Spring forum in Cardiff, emphasising her attachment to \u201cour precious, precious union\u201d as she launches what she calls her \u201cPlan for Britain\u201d. May will describe the relationship between Scotland and the rest of the UK as \u201cmore than just a constitutional artefact\u201d by arguing \u201cit is a union between all of our citizens, whoever we are and wherever we\u2019re from\u201d. As she prepares to invoke article 50, the formal process for leaving the EU, by the end of the month, May will insist it is essential the UK strikes the right deal. \u201cWe have pulled together as one and succeeded together. We are four nations, but at heart we are one people.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
