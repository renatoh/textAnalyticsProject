Jeremy Corbyn pressed on his 'wildest' moment", "bodyText": "It was the Labour leader\u2019s Theresa May moment \u2013 and it was about as risqu\u00e9 as his former rival\u2019s memory of running through a field of wheat. Two years after May was asked by ITV\u2019s Julie Etchingham to share the naughtiest thing she had ever done, the broadcaster urged Jeremy Corbyn to reveal \u201cthe most romantic \u2026 wild and reckless\u201d moment of his life \u2013 and eventually drew the answer that he had enjoyed some \u201cwonderful holidays\u201d with his wife, Laura \u00c1lvarez. Corbyn\u2019s reluctant reply came in previews of an interview with ITV\u2019s Tonight show to be broadcast on Thursday evening, which drew a shocked response from some social media users after Corbyn gave a hazy answer to the question of whether he, like 90% of the population, chooses not to watch the Queen\u2019s speech on Christmas Day. Etchingham\u2019s question on his romantic traits also drew an awkward response. \u201cWow. That\u2019s a hard one. Nobody ever thinks of me as romantic,\u201d he said when the question was first put to him. The presenter asked again: \u201cWhat is the most romantic sort of wild and reckless thing you\u2019ve ever done?\u201d to which Corbyn said: \u201cYou can\u2019t ask that question on television!\u201d Etchingham pressed Corbyn, reminding him of the infamous occasion on which she asked Theresa May the naughtiest thing she ever did during the 2017 election, prompting the Labour leader to finally say: \u201cWhen you\u2019re with somebody, you have a great time together, and we\u2019ve had some wonderful holidays together, and we enjoy that.\u201d May\u2019s response to Etchingham\u2019s question about her naughtiest moment drew widespread derision and imitation in memes. \u201cI have to confess, when me and my friend, sort of, used to run through the fields of wheat \u2013 the farmers weren\u2019t too pleased about that,\u201d the former prime minister admitted. In ITV\u2019s The Leader Interviews: Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 Tonight, which airs at 7.30pm on Thursday, the Labour leader also spoke about his role as his household\u2019s \u201chead of composting\u201d. While Corbyn admitted he wasn\u2019t very good at housework, he said: \u201cI am good at putting the garbage out, I am good at putting the recycling out \u2026 I\u2019m also the head manager of the whole composting arrangements.\u201d Corbyn said he would give up Chequers if he was elected as prime minister. In September, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said he would let a homeless family move into No 11 Downing Street. Corbyn was also asked if he would apologise to those who had suffered as a result of his party\u2019s delays in dealing with allegations of antisemitism. \u201cAntisemitism is a vile evil in our society. I am not a racist, in any form. I\u2019ve spent my life opposing racism. And I think the treatment of Jewish people that suffer from antisemitism is appalling. And where there\u2019s been delays, by my party, in instituting a process, of course I apologise to those that suffered as a result of it,\u201d he said. His apology echoed a similar response in an interview on This Morning on Tuesday. The Labour leader was also asked whether he watched the Queen\u2019s speech on Christmas Day. When Etchingham asked if he sat down with his family to watch the speech, Corbyn said: \u201cIt\u2019s on in the morning, usually we have it on \u2026 some of the time.\u201d After Etchingham pointed out that it was actually broadcast in the afternoon and accused the Labour leader of not watching it, he said: \u201cThere is lots \u2026 Lots to do \u2026 I enjoy the presence of my family and friends around Christmas. Obviously, like everybody else does. And I also visit the homeless shelter, either on Christmas Day or the day before, to talk to, and listen to people\u2019s lives, about how they could be made better with a government that cared for them.\u201d If Corbyn does, in fact, skip the Queen\u2019s speech, he would be in line with about 90% of the public who choose not to tune in. Last year, the Queen\u2019s speech attracted an audience of 6.3 million people."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
