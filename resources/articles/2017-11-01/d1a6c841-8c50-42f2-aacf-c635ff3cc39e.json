It\u2019s the day before the opening of her new exhibition, The Highway is a Disco, at NGV Australia. There is still clanking, thumping and hammering going on inside the multi-roomed space that will house more than 150 of the two-time Archibald prize-winner\u2019s works for the summer. This will be the biggest exhibition of Barton\u2019s work to date, from the paintings that made her famous, to sketches, sculpture and film. The artist herself, however, seems calm. She is seated to one side of a 10m-long, five-panel series of paintings, each containing an image of a dragon and a girl entwined together, swirling patterns of dots and waves engulfing them. This is sing blood-wings sing, a new work that will make its public debut at the Melbourne gallery this week. Like many of Barton\u2019s paintings, its human and animal figures are almost inextricable. A whole spectrum of colour bursts from the frame, but the pinks, blues and purples are what the mind remembers. The art of Del Kathryn Barton is a door to a jungly, fertile universe. Her paintings contain the shapes and textures of the natural world \u2013 beehives, water, spiderwebs, smooth-skinned trees, bubbles, worms, the night sky \u2013 and yet they are otherworldly. This otherworld is populated by unsmiling, anatomically bizarre characters: one has four breasts; another has sixteen eyes; another has no body at all. With their pointed noses and chins, elongated necks and limbs, these characters all have an elfin quality \u2013 even when they are direct representations of living people, such as the portrait of herself and her two children that won the Archibald in 2008, or the portrait of actor Hugo Weaving that won in 2013. Sing blood-wings sing is Barton\u2019s take on the story of Puff the Magic Dragon, from 1963 the folk song by Peter, Paul and Mary. (\u201cThis might be a bit sacrilegious actually,\u201d she says, before admitting she actually prefers Will Oldham\u2019s cover.) She\u2019s given Puff her own characteristic spin though, replacing the male protagonists with female protagonists, and altering the \u201cbeats\u201d \u2013 a term she uses often to talk about key thematic or narrative elements in her work \u2013 to have distinctly female elements. \u201cIt is a coming of age work, and living with my daughter who\u2019s 12 now, and at that very tender, fierce, vulnerable, complex age, with her changing consciousness around her body and the way that she exists in the world, I feel like there\u2019s a lot of her in this work,\u201d she tells Guardian Australia. \u201cWhen we think of dragons in a classical fairy story context, we think of them as slaying \u2013 forces of murder and destruction. I\u2019ve tried to collapse that, so the blood beat speaks to menstruation as a kind of vital, proud, strong experience for a young woman.\u201d Barton is open and expressive with a warm and generous laugh, yet it has been a hard year: her mother\u2019s recent death from cancer was preceded by a long period of palliative care, and Barton\u2019s desire to be as present as possible for that meant a huge disruption to her usual creative routines, on top of the already challenging role of being a working mother. One of the artistic consequences of that period of upheaval is the second new work on display in this exhibition: an enormous sculptural piece, at the foot of your love, which dominates an entire room. The work is comprised of a giant conch shell carved from Huon pine, which sits before a silk sail printed with a patchwork of images: flowers, breasts, sky. Ropes that transform into arms and hands stretch before the conch as if in yearning. Here, like in many of Barton\u2019s paintings and drawings, representations of the human body are entwined with objects and natural elements in ways that are both beautiful and jarring. Not all artists would be confident to break away from their core medium \u2013 for Barton, painting and drawing \u2013 so dramatically, but Barton says has a tendency to become bored and restless in her practice. Her exploration of alternative forms such as sculpture and film feels like \u201ca different way of telling similar stories\u201d, and she enjoys the challenge of bringing \u201csome very realised aesthetic sensibilities and skill to mediums that I know nothing about.\u201d The work that closes off the exhibition is Red, a 15-minute filmic exploration of the \u201cgloriously fucked up and poetic\u201d sexual proclivities of the Australian redback spider. \u201cI was thinking about the elemental, archetypal mother, who\u2019s not just a mother, she\u2019s seductress; she\u2019s murderess, she\u2019s epic mother,\u201d Barton explains. The film contains real spiders and human characters; to Barton, it\u2019s not simply a story about sexual cannibalism, but also a story about willingly sacrificing oneself for one\u2019s children. She had originally envisaged Red to be a short, indie project: \u201cSomething that felt a little bit more like making a drawing.\u201d Then Cate Blanchett agreed to be attached to the work, taking it to whole new level. The highly accomplished 44-year-old artist that Barton is today seems, on one level, a far cry from the girl who grew up in the Australian countryside with little access or exposure to fine art, and who suffered from terrifying and disorienting \u201cbody-boundary confusions and sensory disorders\u201d. Yet that girl is immediately visible in the work itself. \u201cI\u2019ve always had a very big energy in me that I have found hard to manage in some ways,\u201d Barton says. \u201cI ground myself through obsessive mark-making. It\u2019s a state of very precarious balance ... it\u2019s about how to hold a bigness in a harmonious place.\u201d The result is hectic and hyperactive imagery, full of rich detail and complex patterning, that is simultaneously incredibly controlled and extremely labour-intensive for the artist. \u201cIt pulls you in and pushes you back at the same time, I think,\u201d she says of her aesthetic. \u201cIt seduces you but it slaps you round.\u201d Seduction here is chiefly a metaphor: Barton is surprised and frustrated to find her work, with its prolific use of the naked female form, so often framed as explicit or hyper-sexual. \u201cI personally am not into the pornographic body,\u201d she says. \u201cThe naked body is so many more things than that. It\u2019s the private body, it\u2019s the relaxed body in the bath, it\u2019s the breastfeeding body ... the birthing body, the pregnant body \u2013 they\u2019re states of being and states of body-being. And some of the most heightened pleasure zones that I personally have experienced as a woman.\u201d Barton\u2019s work makes more sense when seen as a fusion of dreamscapes and deep emotional narratives \u2013 and she does often draw on her own dreams in her art. But to interpret the childlike interrogation, imagination and wonder with which those narratives are presented as naive or simplistic \u2013 or, conversely, to see them through a primarily voyeuristic lens \u2013 is to miss the point. \u201cI just want, ideally, people to bring much more open, porous kind of engagements to the work,\u201d Barton says. She refers to the \u201cwild element of self and collective unconscious\u201d, and it seems more than anything that her work is an exercise in turning the self \u2013 the body, the experience of physical existence \u2013 inside out: exposing that parallel life, the imaginative, emotional life that we so often repress or ignore, with all its contradictions and glories and ecstasies and fears. In that way, her characters are not so otherworldly after all, but simply representations of a forgotten way of being ourselves. \u2022 Del Kathryn Barton: The Highway is a Disco is showing at NGV Australia, Melbourne, until 12 March 2018 \u2022 Guardian Australia was a guest of the National Gallery of Victoria"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
