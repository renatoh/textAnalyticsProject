But it's actually part of Britain and can be reached in a 20-minute helicopter ride from Penzance. Tresco, the most exotic of the Isles of Scilly - the clear blue skies are available mostly in summer - is high on the list of winter walks for Bill Oddie, birdwatcher, naturalist and self-styled \"old hippie\". Peak time for birdwatching is October, when people come in search of the 408 species found in the Scillies. It's one of the best birding areas in Europe, and when a rare blue rock thrush was spotted recently, 700 enthusiasts were on their way within an hour. You can get round the island in half a day, and it contains a more astonishing variety of scenery than anywhere else he can think of. \"There is such a stark contrast,\" he says. \"At the lower end of the island, you've got the Great Pool, the sand dunes, the woods and farms, and then, as you work north, you go into something completely different, including granite cliffs that get higher and higher. They remind me of Shetland or the Cornish headlands, and there can be a howling gale there even when there's no breeze back at the Pool. There's also Castle Down, an area of heath and gorse, where you feel you've moved to a different island. At the right time of year, it's purple with heather, and in winter it's bleak and bracing. \"The special thing about going off-season is you more or less have the place to yourself. The winter light is soft and different, and the biggest surprise is how mild it is - there are beautiful calm sunny days when you can't believe you're in Britain in winter. And the sea is so blue and clear as it whacks against the cliffs - it's wonderfully spectacular.\" Oddie's favourite lunch spot is the smaller lake, Abbey Pool, where he likes to sit on the soft turf watching the feathered traffic. But - in the parlance of one fellow ornithologist - he's more of a \"legger\" than an \"arser\", and he likes to wander around and check out the latest chiffchaff or North American duck. Walks are his preferred alternative to yoga or sweaty sessions in the gym, and his route on Tresco would take him from the two lakes into the Abbey Gardens, with its famous collection of exotic plants from warmer countries like South Africa. Then he'd head for the dunes and beaches of the east coast, with their views across the blue-green shallows to the island of St Martins. \"In the Scillies, you can always see other islands,\" he says, \"and there are hundreds of little rocks, which is where all the shipwrecks are. You always feel sort of cosy because you're surrounded by an archipelago. I don't think there are any other islands in the world that look so beautiful on a fine day, and on a rough day there's a superb grandeur to them.\" From the dunes, he'd reach Old Grimsby, with its quayside and small cluster of buildings. It's 10 minutes from there to the hamlet of New Grimsby, with its shop, art gallery and pub - the New Inn. From either place, it's then half-an-hour to the rocky north coast where you can search for Piper's Hole, a dangerous drop through the rocks to a sea-level cave. \"I like going right to the edge of the cliff,\" says Oddie. \"All you can see from there is the sea, and the next stop is Ireland or North America. \"And you can watch the weather coming in from the west - on a grey day you can see the front, with a band of blue beyond it, or the other way round, with the grey edge of the rain coming towards you.\" The end of a hard day's arsing and legging will probably see him in the New Inn with its music and pool table before the final walk home: \"It's beautiful walking at night in Tresco, 10 or 15 minutes back to the place I'm staying, in complete darkness and with no noise . \"I've never known anyone go the Scillies and be disappointed. I've said to lots of people that they should go, and I see them later and they all say how amazing it is. It's no surprise that they've been called the fortunate islands: you've never seen anything quite like it.\" The Practicals The nearest rail station is Penzance (national rail enquiries 0345 484950). From there, take the 20-minute shuttle service from the heliport to either Tresco or the main island of St Mary's: fares from \u00a362 for a low-season day return to \u00a398 return from April 1 with British International Helicopters (01736 363871) . There are regular launches between the five inhabited islands. Skybus (0845 7105555) operates light aircraft services from Land's End, Newquay, Plymouth, Bristol and Exeter to St Mary's with fares from \u00a350 low season day return from Land's End, to \u00a3220 return from Bristol. Alternatively, go to St Mary's by sea from Penzance on The Scillonian (0845 7105555) most days but not Sundays, April to October, limited late season sailings, 2 1/2 -hour crossing, fares from \u00a332 low-season day return to \u00a374 return. For cottage rental or timeshare on Tresco, phone the estate office on 01720 422849 or visit www.tresco.co.uk. For other accommodation, contact the Isles of Scilly Tourist Information Office on: 01720 422536 or visit www.isles-of-scilly.co.uk Maps: OS Explorer (2 1/2 ins to 1 mile), no 101 (Isles of Scilly), \u00a35.50 or Landranger (1 1/4 ins to 1 mile) no 203 (Land's End and Isles of Scilly, St Ives and Lizard Point), \u00a35.25. The best time for birdwatching is October, but it gets crowded.
