While the manager pinpointed the defeat at Istanbul Basaksehir as also being pivotal, amateurish defending was to blame for all three Leipzig goals and United now drop into the Europa League last 32. \u201cWe didn\u2019t perform as a team well enough,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cThat is the manager\u2019s responsibility. We never got going \u2013 we didn\u2019t turn up until they got the second goal. You can\u2019t say we were good enough. We were in a difficult group and the big turning point was the loss away in Istanbul. That\u2019s where we lost points we should have got. Today we had to defend crosses into the box and we just didn\u2019t deal with them.\u201d After two minutes Aaron Wan-Bissaka allowed an unmarked Angeli\u00f1o to score from a long diagonal, then the right-back again lost the on-loan Manchester City player as he created Amadou Haidara\u2019s second on 13 minutes. On 69 minutes Justin Kluivert made it 3-0, Harry Maguire this time failing to clear. While Bruno Fernandes and Paul Pogba scored late on it was not enough. The errors followed a similarly poor defensive display at Basaksehir in the 2-1 defeat in November, with Demba Ba\u2019s opener deriving from United leaving the forward unmarked near halfway from their own corner. Solskj\u00e6r urged his players to pick themselves up for Saturday\u2019s visit of City for the derby. \u201cAs a footballer you have to feel sorry for a few minutes and then focus on Saturday, that is a massive game and it is something we have to look forward to,\u201d he said. Pogba made an impact as a second\u2011half replacement. His agent, Mino Raiola, stated on the eve of the match that the midfielder is unhappy at United and it would be best for all if he left in January. Solskj\u00e6r said: \u201cYou have to ask Paul if he is happy or not. Paul is focused on doing his best for the team\u201d He denied Raiola\u2019s comments had disrupted preparations for the match. \u201cThe squad is fine \u2013 they are a team and they stick together. As soon as Paul\u2019s agent realises it is a team sport the better.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
