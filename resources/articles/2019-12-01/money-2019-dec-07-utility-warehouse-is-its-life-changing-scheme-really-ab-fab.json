Yet Guardian Money found that the average amount being earned is less than \u00a312 a week \u2013 and that\u2019s before costs are taken into account. This \u201copportunity of a lifetime\u201d is offered by energy and communications company Utility Warehouse, which says it has enabled many people \u201cto be their own boss, give up their job and even retire early with complete financial security\u201d. A template letter that the firm\u2019s representatives can print off and send to would-be recruits asks: \u201cWant to take control of your life?\u201d and then says tantalisingly: \u201cI\u2019ll show you how to make a lot of money.\u201d But do the claims stack up? So-called \u201cmulti-level marketing\u201d (MLM) schemes such as this are controversial, particularly in the US. One critic of this type of scheme told Guardian Money that, in his opinion, they are \u201ceconomic cults\u201d. But Utility Warehouse says it is very different to some other network marketing businesses that rely on their distributors to buy stock from them, in that its \u201cpartners\u201d (the name for its representatives/agents) incur very little cost aside from their time and a small joining fee. It adds: \u201cThe important thing to understand is that we are presenting illustrations of what is achievable by potential new partners, as opposed to any form of guaranteed income.\u201d Utility Warehouse is the trading name of FTSE 250 firm Telecom Plus, and provides a range of services \u2013 gas, electricity, home phone, broadband and so on \u2013 to more than 600,000 UK homes and businesses. Joanna Lumley promotes the brand and has fronted a series of short films, including one where she talks about how people can earn money. It is pretty much exclusively promoted by its army of self-employed partners, who earn commission by encouraging friends, family and others to sign up to its products. In simple terms, you earn money from the customers you sign up, plus you can recruit other partners. And when they sign people up, you earn a small share of the money they spend, too. Flick through the latest edition of Utility Warehouse\u2019s \u201cThe Opportunity\u201d booklet, which explains how people get paid, and you will see tables and diagrams that highlight the money that can be made. For example, there is one showing an individual at the top of a structure, then below him or her are the people he or she recruited, and then below them are the people they recruited. There is a complex system of payments and bonuses, including \u201cpersonal residual income\u201d (ongoing commission from the people you sign up) and \u201cgroup residual income\u201d (ongoing commission from customers that those in your \u201cteam\u201d sign up). This residual income is payable on all your group customers \u201cdown to infinity\u201d. One document on the company\u2019s website states that you could earn \u00a32,340 a month in group residual income \u2013 or just over \u00a328,000 a year \u2013 which it says is \u201cmore than the average salary in the UK\u201d. This assumes you receive 30p per person per month commission from 7,800 customers signed up by your team. Then there\u2019s the Stairway to Success, which has eight steps. \u201cThe higher up you climb, the greater your monthly and annual earnings could be \u2013 up to a maximum of \u00a31m a year as a five-star NNL national network leader,\u201d says the booklet. On reading that, some will say: \u201cWhere do I sign?\u201d But do many really earn such large amounts? It turns out you need to amass a small country\u2019s worth of people \u2013 500,000 group customers \u2013 to become a five-star NNL. Utility Warehouse has about 645,000 customers. There isn\u2019t much information in its latest results \u2013 covering the six months to 30 September \u2013 about payments to partners. However, they do disclose that there were 43,111 partners. Meanwhile, \u201cdistribution expenses\u201d, which includes the share of the revenue paid as commission to partners, totalled \u00a313.2m for the six months. Dividing that pot between the 43,111 partners gives an average of \u00a3306 per person for the period \u2013 which is \u00a351 a month, or \u00a311.80 a week. And that\u2019s before their own costs, the joining fee and tax. The joining fee has been halved to \u00a3100 for non-customers and \u00a350 for customers. Meanwhile, partners are responsible for paying their own tax. Utility Warehouse is quick to sing the praises of its partners, and the competitive advantage they give the firm, but their \u00a313.2m represents only 3.7% of the company\u2019s total revenue for the half year, which was \u00a3353m. The trade body for this sector, the Direct Selling Association, says that while multi-level marketing structures \u201cmay seem similar to pyramid schemes,\u201d which are illegal in the UK, \u201cin reality they are substantially different and are more similar to a conventional corporate business model\u201d. David Brear, who describes himself as an author who has studied cults, says of MLM schemes: \u201cThey are economic cults.\u201d He says one of the key issues is the \u201cchurn rate\u201d \u2013 how many partners leave the business each year, often because they can\u2019t make money from it? This rate appears to be quite high at Utility Warehouse: in the company\u2019s 2013 accounts, the numbers of partners joining was running at 900 to 1,300 a month, and six years later, in 2019, it was around 1,000 joining each month \u2013 yet the total number of partners has not gone up much: it was almost 39,000 in 2013 and is now 43,111. On the issue of commission, Utility Warehouse told us that its partners\u2019 earning potential \u201cis based on the time and effort they put into the business. The result is that those who consistently gather the most customers/build their teams, eg, by working on this business full time, earn more commission than those who are less focused on Utility Warehouse and do less ... There tend to be fewer really active partners than inactive ones \u2013 which is a source of real frustration.\u201d It adds that dividing \u00a313.2m by 43,111 is \u201cinevitably misleading: there are many partners who, for whatever reason, earn considerably less than \u00a3500 a year, and there are those who work at their business extremely hard and earn considerably more than this\u201d. The company says of the document that mentions \u00a32,340 a month: \u201cDoes this imply all partners will achieve this level of income? Categorically not. It is based on assumptions and uses averages.\u201dAsked about the partners\u2019 share of the revenue, the company says that while around 3% \u201cmay sound low,\u201d it operates in low-margin industries, especially energy. And on the churn rate, Utility Warehouse says: \u201cIf we sign up, say, 1,000 partners in a month, then typically half of them will never really get out of the blocks, and they receive an automatic refund... There is always a level of churn of \u2018no longer active\u2019 partners from the business.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
