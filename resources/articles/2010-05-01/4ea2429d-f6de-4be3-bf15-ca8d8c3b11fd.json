George Monbiot asserts that industrial civilisation, while ravaging the biosphere, will continue for at least a century or two, and criticises the Dark Mountain project group for stating that collapse is upon us (I share their despair, but I'm not quite ready to climb the Dark Mountain, 11 May; Response, 13 May). As a scientist analysing the available data, coupled as it must be with some critical assumptions about future human behaviour, I believe both analyses are incorrect. The core problem is that the current modus operandi of global society is the production of goods and services sold for profit, with these profits subsequently reinvested in further production. Such limitless expansion, on a planet of finite material that can be transformed into usable resources, alongside limits to the processing of waste materials, is clearly impossible in the long term. Monbiot quotes the Dark Mountain group: \"The civilisation we are part of is hitting the buffers at full speed, and it is too late to stop it.\" However, there is relatively little scientific evidence that biophysical environmental limits have already been breached to an extent that societal collapse is inevitable. Recently scientists proposed a \"safe operating space for humanity\", analysing nine possible limits, three of which have perhaps been breached (climate change, biodiversity loss, interference with the nitrogen cycle). However, none were in the \"too late\" category. The Dark Mountain group are wrong. In 2010, humanity is still largely in control of its destiny. But Monbiot's belief that collapse will be a 22nd-century concern is complacent. Certainly, capitalism is both resilient and dynamic. Dogmatic opposition to political intervention in the economy did, for example, rapidly transform into multibillion-pound bank bailouts. However, globally interconnected economic crises, pervasive poverty, increasingly cheap long-distance transport and instantaneous global communications, coupled with rapid environmental changes and geopolitical tensions over access to resources, is a recipe for mass migration, civil unrest and armed conflict. It is not far-fetched to envisage chronic simultaneous crises, with deteriorating environmental conditions at the core, overwhelming political systems in multiple countries this century. We have now left the benign epoch of the Holocene, which saw humans spread across the world and flourish over thousands of years, and entered the Anthropocene \u2013 when, collectively, our numbers and technological capacity mean we are an active force of nature, with the power to inadvertently bring about the collapse of industrial society. No \"creating new myths which put humanity in its proper place\", as the Dark Mountain group suggest, will alter that. Hard science and the even harder political choices (including critical global equity questions, as Monbiot rightly identifies) will be at the core of managing the Anthropocene Earth to allow large numbers of people to thrive. However, contrary to Monbiot's belief, the available evidence suggests there is only a modest window of opportunity left before humanity's destiny is largely hostage to events it cannot control."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
