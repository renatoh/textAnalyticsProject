But look how it has grown. Now business is sensible and mature, concerned about diversity, sustainability and reputation. It helps old ladies across the road. \"Corporate social responsibility\" is a phrase like \"diversity\" and \"work/life balance\". Any mention of it in business and heads around the table nod sagely. It makes you long for a movement of corporate social irresponsibility, just to make life more interesting. Last week, the heir to the throne invited the editor of the Financial Times, Richard Lambert, to become an \"ambassador\" for social responsibility at a gala awards dinner organised by Business in the Community. Things don't get much more mainstream than that. But it is dangerous when a concept becomes such a warm cliche. It reduces the possibility of an honest conversation. There are business people who think that corporate social responsibility is one of the following: how tax-averse governments get out of social provision; how the CEO salves his conscience; how the firm gets good press; or a result of successful bullying by effective campaign groups. But they would never dare to say so. They just nod along with the rest, and then try to restrain effort and expenditure on social responsibility initiatives behind the scenes. And so companies end up doing the bare minimum. They don't believe, so their commitment is limited. One of the many problems with the debate - exemplified by the Guardian/Observer conference last week - is the external focus. The business case made is that consumers are becoming more discerning, and so firms need to be on their mettle. People won't buy from bad companies, so be good. But evidence of the discriminating consumer is actually pretty thin. True, seven out of 10 consumers say they are prepared to pay a little more for products and services from a company if they know it does \"a lot for the wider community\", according to a Future Foundation report. But that kind of survey question is what researchers call a \"yea-saying\" one: hard to say no to. The miracle is that three out of 10 were honest enough to tell a market researcher that they were not prepared to pay a little more for an ethical product. You may remember that the same problem occurred with opinion polls in the run-up to the 1992 general election: people said they were going to vote Labour because they wanted to seem nice and caring, then put their crosses next to the party promising lower taxes. The real case for corporate social responsibility is internal: it is about involving and motivating your employees. Too many companies are engaged in worthy causes outside their walls while treating their staff with contempt. They are like a man who volunteers at the local hospital, then goes home and abuses his wife and children. People want to work for firms that have positive values: look how hard tobacco companies find it to hire decent staff. If companies put some flesh on the dry bones of their \"values statements\" and engage staff in community activities, they can reap rewards in terms of loyalty. The way to get happy customers is to get happy staff. Customers won't be treated like kings by staff who feel like peons. Which means allowing staff to use company time to engage in community activities; it means getting internal policies right before investing outside; it means developing a coherent strategy linked to the needs of the business and the job security of the staff; it means involving employees in the selection of activities, rather than dictating the latest worthy cause. In short, before companies rush to prove their credentials with high-profile charitable events they should pay some attention to their internal culture and policies first. Corporate social responsibility begins at home. At least the corporate social responsibility awards dinners did provide one good joke - from Julia Cleverdon, head of Business in the Community, who reminded attendees that the difference between networking and not working is just one syllable. \u0095 Richard Reeves (rreeves@indsoc.co.uk) is the author of Happy Mondays - putting the pleasure back into work.
