The worst part of the battle was just before we landed. The first wave only got within 300 or 400 feet of the beach. Some men just plain drowned because they had got dropped into the sea. I was in the fifth wave and we were trying to find a place to hit Omaha beach. We had to wait for an hour before the tide came in enough. Our job was to get the soldiers on to the beach and then go back. But when we hit the beach our vehicle got stranded in the water. Fortunately the larger vehicles were directing fire away from our 36ft-boat. We had to run in water up to about our knees and hope and pray we didn't step on a mine. I was worn out because I'd been in the water already trying to get help and I was waterlogged. We had impregnated uniforms, ammunition belts and rifles weighing us down. We ran for a foxhole dug out of the sand, which was big enough for five. Halfway there I had to rest. I remember lying down right beside a soldier. He looked like he'd come in with the tide, drowned. I was 21 but he was even younger. He looked 17. I remember putting my hand on his face. He was ice cold. If there had been any life in him I'd have tried to save him. I got to the foxhole and the coxswain said: 'We're all going to get killed!' Another man said: 'Don't worry, we'll get out of here.' I prayed to myself hard. I said, if I ever get out of this alive I'll go home and have a family and take them to church every Sunday. It's a promise I have been able to keep. We were on the beach for at least an hour. There were big guns pointed to our left and right. I could see a helmet moving as a German ran back and forth in his trench. I picked up my rifle, took my best shot and didn't see the helmet after that. It was a little further than I was used to on the rifle range back home, but it must have scared him. At last we ran down the beach, keeping our heads down, and reached another landing craft. It had been hit and there was water pouring in so I crammed two lifejackets into the gap but it was still taking in water. We got filled up to the gunwales. When everything was at the worst a miracle happened. There was another barge, and they pulled us up and took us back to the mother ship. I lay on the top deck and water ran out of me like a sponge. They put us in a hospital ward with the wounded even though we hadn't been hurt and shouldn't have been there. They took off all our clothes, and I remember I had a little Bible in my pocket. Because we were in the ward, the navy sent a telegraph to our parents and wives saying: 'Missing in action, extent of wound unavailable.' You can imagine how awful that was for them. Later we got recommended for the Purple Heart. I've since wondered whether it was because we were on that list. I'll be spending the 60th anniversary at home because my wife and I have health problems. I have never been back to Normandy. What makes me feel the worst is the thought of those who didn't make it. Two years ago I lost a leg after complications from a heart attack. I could have lost one when I was 21, so I'm pretty lucky.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
