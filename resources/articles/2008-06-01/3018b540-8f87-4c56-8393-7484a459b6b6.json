British reed players Chris Biscoe and Tony Kofi aren't attempting to kidnap his elusive spirit either, but to show what an inspiration he remains, in a set of classics Dolphy wrote or was associated with. Biscoe's ability to bridge sound-worlds as different as Evan Parker's and Charlie Parker's makes him one of the most formidable European saxophonists ever to remain resolutely in the shadows. Tony Kofi is more conventionally soulful and bluesy, and not quite so rhythmically tight, but his vocalised wail is a good foil for Biscoe's more Dolphy-like astringency. Bassist Larry Bartley and straight-ahead but effective drummer Stu Butterfield (whose deep, bell-like cymbal beat gives the groove a very distinctive sonority) unfussily drive a contemporary quartet devotedly rooted in advanced bebop, but so clamorously enjoying it that the music sounds remarkably new. Dolphy classics from the Outward Bound and Out to Lunch albums are here, but also sizzling versions of covers he liked playing, including Oliver Nelson's Stolen Moments and Fats Waller's Jitterbug Waltz."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
