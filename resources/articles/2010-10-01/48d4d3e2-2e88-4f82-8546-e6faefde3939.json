I was incredibly fortunate to escape from the Taj Mahal hotel after being in its lobby when one of the gunmen opened fire. Kasab deserves to spend the rest of his life behind bars. However, I hope that the Indian state would show the compassion that this man and his nine cohorts failed to show others. His death would only create a 10th \"martyr\" of the attack and act as a recruiting advert for radicals in the region. Sajjad Karim MEP Conservative, North West England \u2022\u2008Beno\u00eet Mandelbrot (Obituary, 18 October) also criticised the misuse of maths in economics. He warned of \"fat-tailed\" distributions, which broadly means that unlikely events are much less unlikely than if the normal distribution applied \u2013 and oddities in markets are much more likely than most analysts thought. He said this years before the \"impossible\" combinations happened in the crisis of 2008. Gwydion Williams Peterborough \u2022\u2008\"I feel stupid talking to my baby,\" say parents and carers (In praise of\u2026 talk to your baby, 19 October). Why do they not feel stupid chattering into a mobile phone, as a majority do, while pushing a buggy? Perhaps a mention of this common practice by TTYB would help! Christine Ross Riding Mill, Northumberland \u2022\u2008I once preached for a school whose vicar was Fr Garlick, head Mr Chicken, and chair of governors Mr Cook (Letters, 19 October). Sadly, they belonged to the Guild of Leathersellers, their nominative congruence utterly wasted. Rev Canon Wealands Bell Lichfield \u2022\u2008So we are going to have an aircraft carrier without any planes (Report, 19 October). Very good. Didn't they do that one for Yes Minister? Scott Newton Cardiff \u2022\u2008If I want a vasectomy (\u00a3200 vasectomy fee to addict 'immoral', 19 October), do I have to start a drug habit to get the \u00a3200?
