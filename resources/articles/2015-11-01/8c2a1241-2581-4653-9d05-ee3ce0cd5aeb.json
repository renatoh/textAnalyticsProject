The 21-year-old started 12 of United\u2019s opening 13 games but has not been in the XI for a Premier League match since the 3-0 defeat at Arsenal on 4 October. Depay may be recalled to lead the line for Saturday\u2019s trip to Watford because Van Gaal is facing a selection crisis. His options in attack are limited due to Wayne Rooney\u2019s illness and injuries to Anthony Martial and Marouane Fellaini. Van Gaal, asked if he had hoped for more from Depay, said: \u201cOf course, because otherwise he was still in the team. Otherwise I don\u2019t look for another solution and I look for another solution in my team and I have kept Jesse Lingard and Andreas Pereira for example for that option and now he has to fight back and he does it, so I am satisfied.\u201d Van Gaal said Depay was \u201calways looking good in training\u201d and that inconsistency was to be expected from players of that age. \u201cSometimes they are out of the selection because their competitor is in that moment in a better shape but that doesn\u2019t mean that I have a quarrel with the player,\u201d the manager said. David Beckham, one of Depay\u2019s famous predecessors in the No7 shirt, stated recently the number should not be a burden. Van Gaal does not believe it is to the forward. \u201cI don\u2019t think. I do think the media is making that of it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I am not superstitious and he is certainly not superstitious.\u201d Van Gaal admitted he had a \u201cbig problem\u201d for the Watford game. Michael Carrick, Antonio Valencia and Luke Shaw are also unavailable because of illness and injury, and Bastian Schweinsteiger and Morgan Schneiderlin are doubts after their involvement in the France versus Germany game that was the subject of terrorist attacks in Paris. The manager said: \u201cRooney came back ill after the break. I have only seen him once, the day after the internationals, and then he was at home. I don\u2019t think he can play.\u201d Van Gaal suggested Martial may be fit for Wednesday\u2019s Champions League game with PSV Eindhoven. \u201cIt\u2019s not so long [for him]. It\u2019s a matter of time. Maybe he could have played tomorrow. \u201c[James] Wilson can play but he cannot play a whole match because he doesn\u2019t have the rhythm of the game. Everybody knows Michael Carrick and Anthony Martial are injured, but also injured is Fellaini. That\u2019s a surprise because I thought he was recovered after the international break, but still he is injured. And that\u2019s a big blow because Rooney is ill, so we have a big problem, I think.\u201d Of Schweinsteiger and Schneiderlin Van Gaal said: \u201cIt is also a question if the players wants to play or not to play but I cannot say anything about that. That\u2019s my total human being principle that I always look in the eyes and I communicate with players. \u201c[James] Wilson can play but he cannot play a whole match because he doesn\u2019t have the rhythm of the game. Everybody knows Michael Carrick and Anthony Martial are injured, but also injured is Fellaini. That\u2019s a surprise because I thought he was recovered after the international break, but still he is injured. And that\u2019s a big blow because Rooney is ill, so we have a big problem, I think.\u201d Van Gaal suggested Adnan Januzaj\u2019s season\u2019s loan to Borussia Dortmund may not have been the best choice from the Belgian because he is not getting regular starts. \u201cAll the players there are also of a certain level and I said in advance that\u2019s a big risk for you because you have to compete with other players of a higher level and that is not so easy, it\u2019s the same thing as in Manchester United,\u201d said the Dutchman. \u201cHe has to compete with higher level players and I want him to play all the matches and that is why I want to play him also in the Premier League but he chose for Borussia Dortmund. \u201cWe have to wait and see [if the right move] because now he doesn\u2019t play but he has the talent to play. I am certain he has the talent to play but he has to learn a lot of things. \u201cTalent is important but so is the character to develop your talent. And he can learn that.\u201d Van Gaal said he did not believe United had the option to recall Januzaj early."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
