The School Travel Forum, set up by the leading school tour operators two years ago to improve safety standards, hopes its code of practice will also raise standards among operators. The most important part of the new code is the requirement for operators to submit to an annual external inspection, including spot checks of all key components of the arrangements they offer to schools. Should they fail to meet the required standards, their membership of the School Travel Forum would be terminated. From next month, members of the forum will display an 'STF Approved' logo. Chris Lowe, chairman of the educational visits advisory council and former president of the secondary heads association, said: 'As a head teacher, this is just what I would have wanted.' He said it should give parents the confidence to allow their children to go on school trips. 'Parents want their children to do these things and most realise that children are safer on school trips than anywhere else but, because of the way accidents on such trips have been reported in the media, there might be the need for this sort of reassurance.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
