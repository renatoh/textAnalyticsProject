During a speech at the G20 summit in Brisbane last November, US premier Barack Obama paid tribute to this \u201cstunning\u201d city, dusting off the state of Queensland\u2019s old tourism slogan: \u201cBeautiful one day, perfect the next.\u201d Obama even adopted some local lingo, referring to Australia\u2019s third-largest city as \u201cBrisvegas\u201d \u2013 a nickname that emerged in the mid-1990s as a tongue-in-cheek association with America\u2019s glitzy gambling city, and which was used by out-of-towners to mock Brisbane\u2019s (then) lack of sophisticated nightlife and cultural scene. For all the praise world leaders heaped on Brisbane during the G20 summit, Obama\u2019s utterance of \u201cBrisvegas\u201d opened up some old wounds, apparently. According to Brisbane\u2019s Courier Mail, the Queensland tourism chief Daniel Gschwind took offence to the term, telling the daily newspaper: \u201cI wish people would stop saying that. It is derogatory and negative.\u201d Many blasted him for overreacting. As a proud Brisbanite who has spent the past 11 years abroad, I smiled upon hearing that Obama had used the sobriquet. Growing up in Brisbane in the late 1980s and \u201990s, some of my earliest memories of the city were formed when World Expo 88 rolled into town \u2013 bringing with it more than 15 million visitors over a six-month period. Over time, though, I became aware of Brisbane\u2019s more common reputation: sunny and laid-back, but a dull backwater \u2013 nothing more than a big country-town that was forever playing catchup with Sydney and Melbourne. Bereft of iconic landmarks, memorable museums or a thriving foodie scene, Brisbane lagged sorely behind: a characterless business centre with little to offer. Visitors never lingered, hurrying through it en route to the Gold Coast or Fraser Island and the Great Barrier Reef to the far north. According to Gschwind, however, that is far from the case today. In his admittedly partial eyes, Brisbane has developed dramatically over the years: \u201cWhen I first arrived in the early \u201980s, I was expecting a sub-tropical coastal city. But there was no coast. No access to the river. Absolutely no activity on the weekend. It was a sleepy outpost.\u201d The turning point, he said, was that Expo 88. \u201cIt gave the locals a taste of what the city could be like. The world came to Brisbane ... There was entertainment every night, people out-and-about in the streets. After that, they didn\u2019t want to go backwards.\u201d Fast-forwarding to the world summit of 2014, Gschwind insists he was misquoted about the president\u2019s use of \u201cBrisvegas\u201d. \u201cObama using the old \u2018beautiful one day, perfect the next\u2019 slogan was fantastic - how much better does it get? Yet there was all this Twitter backlash after the newspaper article came out. I thought it was bloody outrageous!\u201d Certainly, with each trip home, I struggle to recognise the city I left more than a decade ago \u2013 and the Brisbane residents I spoke to in the wake of Obama\u2019s speech seemed to agree. Imogen McCann, from Fortitude Valley, returned to the Queensland capital seven years ago following a stint in Saudi Arabia: \u201cI came back and suddenly it was full of boutique restaurants, craft breweries, art galleries and more independent businesses.\u201d \u201cFor me, the city\u2019s coming of age was in 1994, when the then-mayor Jim Soorley allowed caf\u00e9s to put tables and chairs on the footpaths,\u201d said Adrian Humphrey from Cooparoo. \u201cUp until then it was illegal ... He allowed the outdoor dining culture to develop, and it did \u2013 it boomed. This was key, it really contributed to the maturity of the city.\u201d Now feted for its lively alfresco dining, Brisbane is touted as the second fastest-growing metropolis in the western world, its resident population having risen by more than a quarter between 2000 and 2010. Urban renewal schemes \u2013 from the ambitious, multibillion-dollar Queens Wharf casino and tourism precinct to Brisbane Skytower, a 274-metre skyscraper set to be the city\u2019s tallest building upon completion \u2013 plus the ongoing delivery of new road, rail and tunnel links are helping the city cultivate an image as a major player in the Asia-Pacific region for business, international conventions and tourism. Furthermore, Brisbane was a new entrant on Monocle\u2019s global \u2018quality of life\u2019 survey in 2014, and was also recently crowned \u201cAustralia\u2019s hippest city\u201d both by men\u2019s style magazine GQ and the travel bible Lonely Planet. The latter dubbed it an energetic and underrated city \u201con the way up\u201d. From bland and tacky to capital of cool, \u201cBrisvegas\u201d has come a long way \u2013 and it\u2019s still evolving, according to Gschwind. \u201cIt was a blank page, or at least a page with a lot of blank spaces. It means the city can continue to change \u2013 there\u2019s still room to grow into what it wants to be.\u201d As for the Obama controversy: \u201cMonikers change as the city changes, and when it comes to \u2018Brisvegas\u2019, there are people on both sides of the fence.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
