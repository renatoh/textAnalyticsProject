You correctly identify this politically contrived language as inaccurate and misleading. We know it\u2019s also very dangerous. Abortion bans, waiting periods, informed consent requirements, bans on public funding, insurance prohibitions and unnecessary clinic regulations are not designed to protect women. They are crafted by anti-abortion extremists to deter women from accessing abortion and make it more difficult and burdensome to obtain. Meanwhile, the US still has the highest maternal death rates among developed countries, and they continue to rise. This is a direct result of the religious right\u2019s success in restricting access to healthcare, which includes the takeover of hospitals and other healthcare facilities by the Catholic church nationwide. If a woman doesn\u2019t have access to a complete range of affordable health services, the maternal death rate goes up and the infant death rate also rises. Phrases like \u201cheartbeat bill\u201d and \u201cborn-alive legislation\u201d are being used by anti-abortion extremists to pressure lawmakers to pass extreme restrictions designed to attract a supreme court challenge to abortion rights and a reversal of Roe v Wade. Georgia\u2019s version even included a provision that would allow parents to claim an embryo as a dependant on their taxes, and another that included the unborn in the national census. The National Organization for Women is a leader in the national movement to demand that lawmakers correct their actions against reproductive freedom and enshrine women\u2019s rights to bodily autonomy, healthcare and happiness. Thank you for helping us correct their language.
