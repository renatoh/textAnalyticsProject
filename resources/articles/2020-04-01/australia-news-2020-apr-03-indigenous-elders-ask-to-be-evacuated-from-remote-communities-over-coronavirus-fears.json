Medical and cultural groups say governments must act before it\u2019s too late, while doctors warn it\u2019s a \u201cvery difficult decision\u201d and the window in which to make it is closing fast. But the South Australian government has said it will not move people \u201cat this time\u201d. The Anangu-Pitjantjatjara-Yankunytjatjara art centres (APYACC) have been lobbying for three weeks to have the SA government support a plan to transport a group of senior people from their remote communities into isolation at the Wiltja Anangu school in Adelaide. APYACC says border closures aren\u2019t working, with people still crossing in and out on remote roads, and elderly people are living in overcrowded housing alongside several generations of family. \u201cSocial distancing is a luxury we do not have,\u201d elders at one of the APYACC art centres wrote to the SA government this week. \u201cDuring the past week, our communities have seen an influx of estranged family members sent back from the cities as part of the government\u2019s strategy of returning Aboriginal people to their communities,\u201d the elders at Mimili art centre wrote. \u201cAlready crowded houses are now beyond capacity as we try to accommodate the newcomers, many of whom have a recent history of substance abuse and associated challenges. \u201cSelf-isolation and best practice hygiene are not an option in this environment. \u201cIt feels like our people have been herded up and locked down in communities where facilities, housing and medical support are severely lacking.\u201d Prof Paul Torzillo is a leading respiratory and intensive care physician at Sydney\u2019s RPA hospital, and medical director of Nganampa Health Council (NHC), which operates seven clinics in the APY region. Torzillo says moving elders into Adelaide is a \u201cdifficult problem\u201d but Nganampa would support it, if a number of \u201cabsolute preconditions\u201d were met. \u201cThey would be moving from what is currently a very low prevalence location, to a location where there is already community transmission,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, you have to balance against that the fact that once there is community transmission these people will be very susceptible, and it will be incredibly difficult to offer them medical care because of all the logistical constraints on the [APY] lands. In a city they would at least have some chance of getting hospital care. \u201cWe would support this, provided they are safely transported, they have guaranteed accommodation for the rest of the year and the building is secured, and they\u2019re under a public health act that would prevent them either leaving or having visitors. \u201cThere is a very narrow window through which this can be done. \u201cOnce we\u2019ve got community transmission in the lands, these people are at significant risk. So if this were going to to happen, it needs to happen quickly. But it can only happen if all those preconditions are met and the people themselves understand they won\u2019t have any visitors and they won\u2019t be able to leave once they get there,\u201d he said. But the SA government has rejected the plan so far. \u201cCurrent public health advice relating to Covid-19 is that it is safer for Aboriginal people to remain in their communities. Therefore the South Australian government does not support the movement of Anangu off the APY lands at this time,\u201d a SA government spokesperson said. \u201cThe spread of Covid-19 and the government\u2019s response to it is being constantly reassessed, with additional measures being put in place as needed based on public health advice. \u201cActive planning is taking place to protect particularly vulnerable members of remote Aboriginal communities.\u201d Naccho, the peak body representing Aboriginal community controlled health organisations in Australia, fully supports the plan. \u201cThe SA government must listen and act on the advice of the organisers of the evacuation and stop dismissing them,\u201d Naccho CEO Pat Turner said. \u201cShared and equal decision making is essential to resolve this impasse. SA Health has been too slow to activate this matter. I as CEO fully support the wishes of the elders themselves and fully respect their right to decide.\u201d Turner also renewed calls for the army to help combat the virus in Aboriginal communities. \u201cEveryone in leadership roles on the APY lands have strongly advocated for many weeks and would welcome the presence of the Australian army and that should be negotiated in terms of actual resource requirements and roll out immediately,\u201d Turner said. \u201cGovernments must resource the provision of a professional health workforce to be present on the lands, full supplies of all PPE, isolation facilities, rapid testing and results regime, and treatment facilities for handling COVID. \u201cThis is needed in all our communities,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
