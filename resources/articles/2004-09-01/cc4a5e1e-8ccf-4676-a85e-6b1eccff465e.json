The revolt on the higher education bill all but overturned the government's majority in the Commons. Its consequences for part-time, mainly adult learners are still being worked through, though there is widespread anxiety that fees may triple when the new regime is introduced, without access to the same scale of loans available to full-timers. The Higher Education Funding Council for England promises a review this year, which must surely come up with a fairer policy that offers greater equity to people who need to combine study with work or family responsibilities. In further and adult education, on the other hand, comment to date has been limited mainly to the sector. There are significant changes afoot here, too, though. Until now colleges have received 75% of the full costs of running courses from the LSC, with the balance made up by student fees, except where learners qualify for exemption. However, unlike most adult education providers, a number of colleges have sought to extend their reach by waiving fees - settling for a lower rate per student in order to reach more people. Students up to 19 can study full-time without paying fees, and fees are waived for adults following courses in literacy, language and numeracy and adults on income-based benefits. Following the Skills Strategy, the group entitled to free tuition will be extended to include learners of all ages studying for their first, full, level 2 course - equivalent to five GCSEs at grade A* to C. Since there is little new money in the pot this year, that entitlement will be covered, in part anyway, by increased fees. The LSC circular proposes, broadly, that institutions will need to raise fees for \"other provision\", ie courses that fall outside the government's priority areas and outside the National Qualifications Framework - meaning that learners who can afford to will have to pay 35% of the costs. Traditionally, adult education for personal development has involved slightly higher fees for learners, who pay 40% of the costs on average. Since those institutions that have waived fees can now be expected to achieve income targets, fees would rise markedly in some places if the proposals are carried through unchanged. The case for change has been made consistently over 15 years by governments of different persuasions. If we are to become a learning society, the argument goes, every one needs to invest more - the government, individuals and employers. Certainly, after a slow start the government has invested increased sums in lifelong learning. Now, steadily, it is increasing the contribution of those people who can afford to pay, whilst offering more support to learners with low levels of formal skills. At the same time, the guarantee that funding will be ringfenced for learning for personal and community development should offer reassurance to pensioners and others that their provision will not disappear. What is missing is a parallel measure to make sure that employers of all sorts do invest in the learning needed to keep Britain prosperous and its workers up to date. There is impressive evidence from the Employment Training Pilots that employers can be persuaded to join in, and increase demand for training. But the bulk of the cost of the pilots is borne by the state. The timidity of British industry in investing in skills contrasts sharply with other countries, and leaves Britain languishing in the league tables of total investment in education and training. When public and private spending are added together, as a proportion of GDP we are near the bottom of the G8 countries and well below average in Europe. It would be good to think that everyone at work had the minimum right to five days a year to learn, which David Miliband proposed when he was at the Institute of Public Policy Research a decade ago. I have always been in favour of higher fees and a high volume of provision for adults who can pay, backed by generous discounts for the hard-up. The alternative is a narrower curriculum - with little space for clowning skills, or the day mariner's course, or Serbo-Croat. Where money is tight and public, the language of priorities is too often in tension with measures to stimulate new interests and satisfy curiosities. We need a system that can support free provision for those who benefited least from school, and those without money, and modestly subsidised encouragement to learn about all life's possibilities. The trick is to get the balance right, and on the whole I think the LSC has more or less got it right this time. \u00b7 Alan Tuckett is director of the National Institute of Adult Continuing Education (Niace)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
