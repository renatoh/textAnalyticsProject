Read the latest blog summary here. Guardian Washington bureau chief sends this from an Occupy protest in the capital: Michael Grimm, the Staten Island congressman charged with 20 federal criminal offences, won reelection last night by 13 points. His supporters can\u2019t get enough, the Guardian\u2019s Kayla Epstein (@kaylaepstein) reports: And at no point was the applause for Grimm louder than when he was asked if he had the proper temperament to serve in Congress. He he did not dodge. He did not stumble or miss a beat. \u201cWhat I said to the New York 1 reporter was inappropriate,\u201d he acknowledged. But then Grimm, a former FBI agent, planted his feet, faced the audience and declared: \u201cI\u2019m a United States marine and I\u2019m tenacious!\u201d The crowd ate it up. Read the full piece here. Jeb Lund has our ear with his Comment Is Free piece \u201cWelcome to the Great Liberal Hangover of 2014. Will anything make it go away?\u201d: Of course, whether the Democratic Party stands for anything is a perfectly valid question at this point. On a macro level, a party that is already thoroughly militarized and corporatized \u2013 and largely indifferent to Main Street whenever it poses a conflict with Wall Street \u2013 offers little alternative to the other party that already celebrates that. But on a specific level, things look just as bad. Read the full piece here. No Bingo, it looks like. Here\u2019s a summary of what the president said: On the question of whether the Democratic losses yesterday were a rejection of him or his policies, Obama said he wasn\u2019t going to read tea leaves. \u201cObviously the Republicans had a good night, and they deserve credit for running good campaigns,\u201d he said. Obama said he was willing to drink bourbon with McConnell or let Boehner beat him at golf if it helped. \u201cI\u2019m certainly going to be spending a lot more time with them now,\u201d Obama said. Obama said he plans to take executive action on immigration reform this year. That was an hour after McConnell said doing so would \u201cpoison the well\u201d. Obama agreed with Republicans that free trade, a deal on corporate taxes that would in part fund infrastructure spending, and early childhood education were areas both sides might agree on. The president said he would veto any bill that repealed Obamacare or abolished the individual mandate. Obama said he would look for a new authorization for the use of military force to fight Isis militants in Iraq and Syria. Is the US policy against Isis militants working? \u201cI think it\u2019s too early to say,\u201d Obama said. Also this year the president said he would seek new funding to fight Ebola and a spending bill or budget. Obama said he is confident that if a nuclear deal with Iran is reached, Congress can be made to see that it\u2019s a good one. \u201cI am really optimistic about America,\u201d Obama concluded. \u201cI know that runs counter to the current mood.\u201d That\u2019s a wrap for the president. \u201cI am really optimistic about America,\u201d Obama says. \u201cI know that runs counter to the current mood.\u201d But when you look ati it, he says, the economy is strong, energy production is strong, the deficit is lower, more people have heatlh insurance, businesses are thriving, education is expanding, more women are getting degrees and entering the workforce. \u201cOne thing I love about campaigning, you travel around the country and folks are just good. ... they\u2019re really practical, good, generous people.\u201d \u201cWe have all the best cards relative to every other country on Earth.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m gonna try different things,\u201d Obama says. \u201cWhether it\u2019s having a drink with Mitch McConnell. Or letting John Beohner beat me again at golf.\u201d He even mentions weekly news conferences, but we won\u2019t hold our breath. Last question, Obama announces. He\u2019s asked about the relative strength of the Democratic agenda versus how they campaigned. He ends up talking about voter turnout. He says Democrats have good ideas. He says \u201cwe\u2019ve got to look at the 2/3rds of people who were eligible to vote and just didn\u2019t vote.\u201d He says he was proud of getting people to vote when he ran for office. \u201cSustaining that, especially in midterm elections, has proven difficult.\u201d Obama is asked why he was not invited to appear with Democratic candidates on the campaign trail. \u201cI love campaigning,\u201d Obama says. \u201cI love talking to ordinary people... I love shaking hands. Giving hugs. ... but I\u2019m also a practical guy. And ultimately every candidate out there had to make their own decisions.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve had the limelight. There have been times where the requests for my appearance were endless. There have been times where politically we were down.\u201d \u201cThe one thing I\u2019m pretty confident about is I\u2019m going to be busy over the next two years,\u201d Obama says. He says he\u2019ll play hard \u201cthrough the fourth quarter\u201d. In government, unlike basketball, Obama says, \u201cThe only score that matters is how did somebody else do, not how you do. And that\u2019s the score I\u2019m keeping.\u201d Obama is asked about being a lame duck. \u201cHere\u2019s what I tell my team,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have this incredible privilege of being in charge of the most important organization on Earth... and there\u2019s a lot of work to be done. ... \u201cI\u2019m gonna squeeze every last little bit of opportunity to help make this world a better place over these last two years.\u201d On potentially repealing the medical device tax, Obama says, \u201cI think I\u2019d rather hear from Mitch McConnell and John Boehner what ideas they\u2019d like to pursue\u201d before answering. On repatriation \u2013 meaning closing tax loopholes to pay for infrastructure projects \u2013 \u201cthere is an opportunity for us to pursue a process that\u2019s good for business, that\u2019s good for jobs,\u201d Obama says. Obama dismisses the notion that the election was a rejection of his immigration reform plan. He said he won\u2019t read the tea leaves of an election. He turns to energy issues: \u201cOn Keystone, there\u2019s an independent process, it\u2019s moving forward.\u201d Obama will watch it play out. He says climate change concerns are part of the formula. While this debate about Canadian oil has been raging, Obama says, we\u2019ve seen some of the biggest increases in American energy production in our history. He means fracking. \u201cKeystone I just consider as one small aspect of a broader trend.\u201d Obama is asked about the McConnell \u201cpoison the well\u201d phrase and \u201cwaving the red flag in front of a bull\u201d, meant to describe what Obama\u2019s unilaterally acting on immigration would mean. Question for the president: Don\u2019t you believe they mean it? Obama says he answered the question on immigration. \u201cI have no doubt that there will be some Republicans who are angered or frustrated by any executive action I might take,\u201d he says. He says those people oppose any kind of immigration reform. Obama says he thinks Boehner wants immigration reform. He said he held off for a year and tried to give Boehner room to \u201cget something done.\u201d The president notes there\u2019s another Obamacare open enrollment period next month. \u201cWe\u2019re really making sure the web site works super well before the next open enrollment period, Obama says. The press laughs a bit. On health care. There are certainly some lines I\u2019m gonna draw. Repeal of the law I won\u2019t sign. Efforts that would take away health care from the 10m people who now have it and the millions more who are eligible to get it, we\u2019re not going to support. In some cases... changes that would undermine the structure of the law, I\u2019ll be honest with them and say the law doesn\u2019t work if you pull out that piece. That said, Obama says, the law is not perfect and he\u2019s open to changes, \u201cif in fact one of the items on McConnell-Boehner agenda is to make responsible changes to [Obamacare], I\u2019m going to be very open and receptive to those ideas...\u201d \u201cWe now know that the law works,\u201d Obama says. He says millions more are insured, expanded Medicaid his helping people and \u201ceven as we\u2019ve enrolled more people in the ACA... health care inflation has gone down every single year since the law passed.\u201d Obama says the individual mandate is off the table. He learned it from Mitt Romney, he says. On to a replacement for AG Eric Holder. We have a number of qualified candidates, Obama says. \u201cI\u2019m not running again,\u201d Obama says. \u201cI\u2019m not on the ballot. I don\u2019t have any further political aspirations. My number one goal is to deliver all I can for the American people in these last two years.\u201d \u201cOur first focus Ed here, is to drive Isil out of Iraq\u201d Obama says. He says the point of the Syria effort is to break up the Isis resupply chain. \u201cThere are aspects of what\u2019s going on in Syria that we\u2019ve gotta deal with.. for example our support of Kurds in Kobani... that\u2019s not just because we\u2019re trying to solve a Syria problem.\u201d \u201cIn terms of things to do differently... if you\u2019re asking about personnel, or about positions on issues, then it\u2019s probably premature... what I\u2019d like to do is to hear from Republicans to find out what it is that they would like to see happen. I\u2019m open to working with them on the issues where they think there is going to be cooperation.\u201d Obama is asked whether the US is winning against Isis militants. \u201cI think it\u2019s too early to say,\u201d he says. He says a long-term solution is most important. But the US is not looking for a comprehensive solution to what\u2019s wrong in Syria. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is to find a core group that we have confidence in, that we\u2019ve vetted\u201d who can beat Isil then serve as an actor in some kind of transition. Many tricky steps there. \u201cPart of the challenge is, it\u2019s a messy situation,\u201d Obama says. On Iran, because of the sanctions, Obama says, they\u2019ve come to the table and they\u2019ve negotiated seriously. We have been able to freeze their programs, he says. He says Russia is cooperating. He depicts the process as constructive. He says the P5+1 can verify that the cuts to the program are real. Whether we can actually get a deal done, we\u2019re going to have to find out... We have presented to them a framework that would allow them to meet their peaceful energy needs. ... But would Congress have to approve any deal? Obama does not say. The reporter asks a follow-up. \u201cThere are a series of different sanctions,\u201d Obama says. Unilateral sanctions, UN sanctions. In each case it\u2019s different, he says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to put the cart before the horse.\u201d \u201cIf we do have a deal... then it will be time to engage with Congress, and I think we\u2019ll be able to make a strong argument to congress that this will be the best way for us to prevent a nuclear Iran.\u201d QUestions about nuclear negotiations with Iran and a possible new force authorization to fight Isis in Iraq and Syria. Obama says he\u2019s meeting with Pentagon and Congressional leaders to meet Friday about the \u201cfight against Isil\u201d. On the authorization to use force, \u201cwe\u2019ve already had conversations,\u201d Obama says. He says the government needs to \u201cright-size and update\u201d the authorization. \u201cWe now have a very different type of enemy,\u201d he says. \u201cIt makes sense for us to make sure that the authorization from Congress reflects ... our strategy going forward.\u201d Question: why have you only met with Mitch McConnell once or twice in six years? Why haven\u2019t you done more to meet Republicans? \u201cI\u2019m certainly going to be spending a lot more time with them now,\u201d Obama says. HE says \u201cmost of my interactions with members of Congress have been cordial and constructive. Oftentimes though we haven\u2019t been able to get what\u2019s discussed in leadership meetings through caucuses to deliver a bill.\u201d He says he thinks BOehner and McConnell can work well together. \u201cI\u2019m certainly going to be spending a lot more time with them now. I take them at their word, that they want to produce.\u201d Obama turns to bourbon: I would enjoy having some Kentucky bourbon with Mitch McConnell. I don\u2019t know what his preferred drink is. He has always been straightforward with me. He\u2019s never made a legislative promise that he couldn\u2019t deliver. And so I think we can have a productive relationship\u201d On immigration, I know there are concerns, the president says, that using executive authority would disrupt or derail work to legislate on the issue. I\u2019ve heard that argument now for a couple of years. .. We didn\u2019t see legislative action. ... We got really good work done by a bipartisan group of senators... The best way if folks are serious about getting immigration reform done is go ahead and pass a bill... then the executive actions go away. Obama is asked whether by acting unilaterally on immigration he risks scratching other potential areas of cooperation with the Republicans. McConnell, after all, did just use the phrase \u201cred flag\u201d. Obama says that\u2019s not his concern. \u201cThat is your job. But what\u2019s also true is I am president of the United States...\u201d He says people will ask for greater accountability for him, and that\u2019s fine. He says he will do absolute best to deliver for people. In terms of immigration, I have consistently said that it is my profound preference... to see Congress act on a comprehensive immigration reform bill... The Senate, on a bipartisan basis, passed a good bill... Speaker Boehner I think was sincere about wanting to pass it.. What I indicated to him was that I feel obliged to do everything I can lawfully with executive authority to make sure we don\u2019t keep making the situation worse... You send me a bill that I sign, and those executive actions go away. Before the end of the year, we\u2019re gonna take whatever lawful actions that I can take that I would believe would improve the functioning of our immigration system. But, what I\u2019m not going to do is just wait. Q: If 2010 was a shellacking, as you called it, what\u2019s this? A: There\u2019s no doubt that Republicans had a good night. And what we\u2019re going to make sure what we do is to reach out... and find out what their agenda is. What\u2019s most important to the American people right now... is, get stuff done. \u201cEvery single day I\u2019m looking for, how can we do what we need to do better.... That\u2019s not gonna stop. Every election is a moment for reflection. Everybody in this White House is going to look and say all right, what do we need to do differently? I maybe have a naive confidence that if we continue to focus on the American people, and not on our own ambitions and image or various concerns like that, that at the end of the day, when I look back, that I\u2019m going to be able to say that the American people are better off than before I was president.\u201d Obama says if Republicans have good ideas he\u2019ll take them. \u201cI want to just see what works.\u201d He mentions again infrastructure spending and early childhood education. Obama returns to \u201cAreas where we do agree\u201d: On infrastructure. On making sure we\u2019re boosting American exports. Obama says he wants a very specific agenda from Republicans and \u201clet\u2019s compare notes. Let\u2019s get started\u2019. Obama takes a question about the vote being a rejection of him personally: As president they rightly hold me accountable to do more to make it work properly. I\u2019m the guy who\u2019s elected by everybody. ... They want me to push hard.. to get stuff done. In terms of agenda items, though.. a minimum wage increase, for example. Where voters had a chance... they voted for it. .. The key is to find areas where the agenda that I put forward ... overlap ssomewhere with some of the ideas that Republicans have. There\u2019s not going to be perfect overlap.\u201d \u201cWe are more than just red and blue states, Obama says. \u201cWe are the United States.\u201d Old turn of phrase, feeling older now, but insistent on his part. Obama calls for three steps to be taken by the current Congress, before the end of the year: 1. Funding to fight Ebola in Afirca 2. A new bipartisan authorization to use military force against Isis 3. A new spending bill. The September continuing spending resolution gives Congress five more weeks to pass a new budget. Obama says ideas will be judged on their merits not on their partisan origin. Congress will pass some bills that I cannot sign. I\u2019m pretty sure I will take some actions that Congress will not like. That\u2019s natural. That\u2019s how governing works. Obama then talks about tax reform and free trade, two areas McConnell also mentioned. Obama calls for tax reform that closes loopholes to pay for infrastructure spending. \u201cAnd to grow exports in new markets.\u201d We all share the same aspirations for our young people, including early childhood education and college debt relief. So those are some areas where I think we have opportunities to cooperate. Here\u2019s Obama. He says he looks forward to advancing America\u2019s business. He says he appreciated McConnell\u2019s words about the prospect of working together. Obviously the Republicans had a good night, and they deserve credit for running good campaigns... What stands out to me though, was that the American people sent a message... they expect the people they elect to work as hard as they do... they want us to get the job done... To everyone who voted, I want you to know that I hear you. To the two-thirds of voters who chose not to participate in the process yesterday, I hear you too.\u201d From the comments: Not a lot of faith that the leadership the Republicans are replacing really had the interests of the little guy at heart. What do you think? Will Republican leadership of the Senate be better or worse for the country? Or just more of the same? Obama is to begin speaking shortly about his party\u2019s stunning losses of last night, which are very hard not to trace back to voter disapproval of his performance. What do you say after your favored candidate for Maryland governor lost by double digits, your friend was ejected from the governor\u2019s mansion in Illinois and every close Senate race plus North Carolina plus almost Virginia slipped out of the Democratic grasp? Here\u2019s that Bingo card again for you: Here\u2019s a summary of the policy areas McConnell touched on as he prepares to take leadership of the Senate: McConnell said the Republican Senate and the White House could find common ground on free trade and on tax reform. McConnell warned the president against taking unilateral action on immigration reform, which McConnell said would be tantamount to \u201cwaving a red flag in front of a bull\u201d McConnell also mentioned many Republican projects that he said the president might not like, including: Energy issues including but not limited to the Keystone pipeline. Obamacare cuts including the tax on medical devices and the individual mandate Using the power of the purse to clear away new regulations specifically pertaining to the War on Coal ie carbon emissions ie EPA funding. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be shutting down the government,\u201d McConnell said repeatedly. \u201cThe Senate in the last few years basically doesn\u2019t do anything. We don\u2019t even vote,\u201d McConnell began his address by saying. Last question for McConnell: he\u2019s asked about potential mutiny to his leadership bid by Ted Cruz or other restive senators. \u201cLet me just make a prediction for you: a week for tomorrow I\u2019ll be elected majority leader of the Senate,\u201d McConnell said. McConnell said he took a call from Reid and they had an amicable chat. Reid complimented him on his campaign, he said. On to foreign policy: \u201cThe immmediate concern is obviously the Ebola crisis... with regard to the authorization to help the Syrian rebels, as you know we insisted on that terminating at the end of this year so we could have a new discussion with the administration...\u201d They\u2019re going to discuss it over lunch on Friday. More on why McConnell doesn\u2019t think the GOP will need to shut down the government: We have the opportunity now to pass the budget. So I think we have other mechanisms that were unavailable to us with the previous configuration of the government, and I think that\u2019s a pretty important tool. McConnell talks about the Democrats\u2019 move to change Senate rules to allow some presidential nominees to go through on a simple majority of votes. It was a huge, huge mistake in my view. It is hard to unring a bell. They\u2019ve now established a precedent. It\u2019s a big issue. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be shutting down the government, \u201c McConnell says, again. He says he\u2019s going to the White House for lunch on Friday. He\u2019s asked about all the senators in his caucus who could be disruptive because they\u2019re focused on presidential runs. What I tell em all is, the best day you have will be the day before you announce. ... I have no problems with people\u2019s ambitions. .. they\u2019re all ambitious or they wouldn\u2019t be where they are. Therer\u2019re a lot of folks with sharp elbows and big egos. I\u2019m not troubled by amibtition, and I think we can accommodate that and still make progress for the country\u201d \u201cChoosing to do things unilaterally on immigration would be a deep mistake... it\u2019s like waving a red flag in front of a bull,\u201d McConnell says. He says Obama did so with Obamacare and with earlier executive orders on immigration reform. \u201cI hope he won\u2019t do that, because I think it poisons the well ...\u201d \u201cThere are some things we can do with 51 votes. The budget. I think it\u2019s in our ability... to pass more appropriations bills that fund the government.\u201d He mentions ending the \u201cbureaucratic strangulation of the economy\u201d and using the power of the purse to push back. He singles out cap and trade and the War on Coal, as he calls it, meaning taxes attached to carbon emissions under Obama regulations. There will be no government shutdowns, and no default on the national debt. On to Obamacare. It\u2019s no secret REpublicans think it was a huge mistake, McConnell says. But \u2018he\u2019s still there\u2019. I will say this for sure. There are pieces of it that are deeply unpopular. The medical device tax. The loss of the 40-hour work-week. The individual mandate. People hate it. \u201cWe\u2019re going to function. We are. We\u2019re going to pass legislation. Some of it he may not like. But we\u2019re gonna function. This gridlock can be ended.\u201d But... \u201cThe veto pen is a very big thing... that\u2019s the way our system works.\u201d There\u2019s only one Democrat that counts: the president, McConnell says. McConnell said a $5m per person estate tax exemption indexed to inflation was a key part of the fiscal cliff deal he had negotiated with Biden. But the leader of the Democrats in the House said they wouldn\u2019t vote in favor of any deal that contained the deal. Then they did. \u201cThe Democrat who counts is the president of the United States,\u201d McConnell says. McConnell says he and Obama were just talking about trade agreements. Repulibcans \u201cthink international trade is good for America,\u201d he says. \u201cThe president indicated he\u2019s interested in doing tax reform,\u201d McConnell says. \u201cHe\u2019s interested in that issue, and we are too.\u201d McConnell blames paralysis in the 113th Congress on the Senate. He says the House has passed bipartisan legislation but the Senate won\u2019t act. Such as on immigration No, McConnell does not list examples. We will vote on things the administration isn\u2019t fond of, McConnell says. He specifies \u201cthe energy front\u201d. He says that means more than just the Keystone pipeline. But \u201cthe employment figures connected with Keystone are stunning,\u201d he allows. From an institutional point of view, the Senate needs to be fixed.... The Senate in the last few years basically doesn\u2019t do anything. We don\u2019t even vote. He says the Senate needs to work more, with votes on Friday, and ocasionally \u201cburning the midnight oil\u201d. McConnell begins speaking. He starts with remarks about the University of Louisville. Then he\u2019s on to dysfunction in Washington. He says he spoke with President Obama today. \u201cWe agreed that we ought to see what areas of agreement there are.\u201d We\u2019re about to hear from the next Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, who\u2019s to speak at the Chao Auditorium of the McConnell Center at the University of Louisville. Watch it live on C-SPAN here. President Obama is scheduled to speak at the White House at 2.50pm ET, after his party was defeated in the battle to control the next US Senate and on pretty much every other front. Obama has hinted that he hopes to pursue some bipartisan legislation and to use his second term to make a mark on the wider world. Republicans took firm control of the US Senate, with projections showing the GOP likely to have an eight-seat majority. They also look likely to win 247 seats in the House of Representatives, cementing their hold there. Louisiana will go to a runoff election, but the Republican candidate looks poised to beat the incumbent Democrat. Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell will give a speech at 1.30pm ET, the day after he easily won re-election in Kentucky and saw his path cleared to become the majority leader. McConnell fended off both a Tea Party challenger and well-funded Democrat during a campaign that mirrored the successful tactics of his party to marginalize extreme voices in the party and tie Democrats to an unpopular president. A few races are still undecided, including a Senate race in Alaska in which the Democratic candidate has not yet conceded, and a close congressional race in Arizona. Democratic governor John Hickenlooper confirmed a close victory in Colorado Wednesday morning, but the GOP claimed victory in a number of other gubernatorial races around the country. Winning Republicans candidates made a number of firsts, including the youngest woman elected to Congress, the first black female Republican elected to Congress and the first female combat veteran elected to the Senate. In the wake of defeat, elected leaders do little so quickly as blame each other for those defeats, but the Democrats make take longer than usual to sort out their differences, the Guardian\u2019s Dan Roberts (@robertsdan) reports from DC: Among those on the left of the party, the answer is all of the above. \u201cIt\u2019s shocking, but only in magnitude,\u201d said one senior union official on Wednesday. \u201cWhen the economy is bad and one party says the economy is bad (though offers no ideas) while the other party\u2019s leader says the economy is good, it\u2019s kinda clear who will win.\u201d Yet the official Democratic narrative is more likely to be written by members of Hillary Clinton\u2019s camp, who privately agree with many Republicans that Obama\u2019s competency in office is at the core of the problem. But Republicans also simply orchestrated more disciplined, effective, campaigns than Democrats did this time around. Criticism is already growing, for example, of a Kentucky candidate\u2019s decision to run from Obama so hard that she wouldn\u2019t even say whether she had voted for him, and of Senator Mark Udall\u2019s relentless attacks on Republicans in Colorado for being anti-women even as his opponent. For its part, the White House began carefully shifting the blame as polling showed defeat becoming likely, insisting that campaign decisions such as keeping the president away from battleground states were driven by local candidates rather than Obama himself. Dan chalks up the Republican victory in large part to the way it defeated an unruly Tea Party wing and to how it pushed down the president\u2019s approval ratings and then used that disapproval to hammer Democratic candidates.

The Guardian\u2019s Rory Carroll (@rorycarroll72) talked with the GOP strategist who made it possible. Todd Harris, a veteran Republican strategist from California, said \u201cIt got people to take notice of her,\u201d as he clutched a Bud Light and Republicans whooped and celebrated around him in Des Moines. \u201cIt was by no means unanimous that we should run this ad but Joni believed in it.\u201d \u201cThe campaign didn\u2019t have a lot of money so we knew we had to take some risks. We wanted to test the line so she used it as a one-liner in a debate. It worked. It really killed. So we knew it was funny.\u201d Harris doubted she would repeat the swine line in future races. \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about hog castration, less is probably more. I don\u2019t expect to see it on TV again.\u201d Ernst won easily by more than seven points. In case you\u2019ve missed the ad, in which Ernst cheerfully recalls how the hogs squealed as she castrate them, you can watch it here, and you can read more from Rory\u2019s piece here. Not sure how to keep the party going now that election night has rounded the corner into day-after-election-day-afternoon? Have you considered Obama bingo? Play along by placing tokens on appropriate squares whenever the president\u2019s remarks coincide with your one on portion of the board. Print your copy before the president\u2019s scheduled remarks at 3pm ET today, and enjoy the singular experience of shouting \u201cbingo!\u201d at the television or computer screen in the middle of the afternoon. We\u2019ll also be watching Mitch McConnell\u2019s speech, scheduled for 2pm, to hear what the GOP\u2019s big winner has to say. Feel free to make Republican speech bingo boards at home. Other people feeling good about today include senators John McCain and Paul Ryan, who\u2019re both waiting in the wings to swoop down on important committee chairs. McCain looks poised to become chairman of the armed services committee, and the hawkish Arizona senator has pushed for more defense spending and intervention abroad, particularly Syria. He has not shied from criticising the Obama administration\u2019s foreign policy, and has a long and complicated relationship with the many powers of the Pentagon, including defense secretary Chuck Hagel. Ryan wants to chair the ways and means committee, a position which has been described by a congressman as being \u201clike having a wife and a mistress. You can\u2019t satisfy either one of them. So he\u2019s going to have an impossible situation for himself.\u201d The committee handles a lot of cash and policy, and although powerful will be a test for Ryan\u2019s ascetic ideas about government. It\u2019s unclear how either man would approach his new job \u2013 both swing between poles of uncompromising politics and willingness to compromise, and, just for drama, both know what it\u2019s like to lose to an Obama ticket. A key Latino congressman has delivered a stern warning to President Obama, telling him that \u201ctime\u2019s up\u201d for the president to act unilaterally on immigration reform. The Guardian\u2019s Tom McCarthy (@teemcsee) reports: Representative Luis Gutierrez, a 20-year veteran of Congress from Chicago, spoke Wednesday morning to fellow advocates at the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights offices. Gutierrez urged Obama to circumvent Congress to end the threat of deportation for many of the country\u2019s estimated 10 million undocumented immigrants. \u201cThe politics are over,\u201d Gutierrez said, addressing Obama. \u201cThe Senate has been lost. But you are still president of the United States of America, we elected you to a four-year term, it is time for you to act.\u201d Gutierrez said Latino voters had faithfully supported Democrats but that the arrangement might not last if the bloc did not see results. He warned the president not to try to cut a deal with Republicans. \u201cWe went through an election cycle in which immigrants were used and vilified by the Republican party, and now we\u2019re supposed to wait for them to be kind and generous to us?\u201d Gutierrez said. \u201cNo. You had two years. We passed the Senate bill \u2026 and you refused to act.\u201d \u201cTime\u2019s up. It\u2019s time for the president of the United States to act and to defend our community. And to be brave, and to be courageous. And to keep his commitment and his word to our community.\u201d Gutierrez had previously warned that inaction could lead to \u201ccivil war\u201d among Democrats, and today he has written a piece today for the Guardian\u2019s opinion desk, \u201cElection day is over. It\u2019s time for real US immigration reform. Your move, Obama.\u201d Colorado\u2019s newly re-elected governor, John Hickenlooper, is already trying to bridge the gap. The Democrat says about ousted senator and party ally, Mark Udall: \u201cI thought his concession speech was one of most beautiful I ever heard \u2026 he has given so much to the state.\u201d Then he says he got a call this morning from the man who beat Udall, Republican Cory Gardner, who told him: \u201cWe\u2019re going to be able to work together very well.\u201d Both parties seem to believe that a lot of phone calls will ease make the two years ahead. An Arizona congressional battle is \u201con a knife\u2019s edge\u201d, my colleague Paul Lewis (@paullewis) reports on the second district there: So far, officials have counted three-quarters of the ballots (157,534 votes). Remarkably, there are just 36 votes separating Republican Martha McSally from the incumbent Democrat, Ron Barber. McSally, marginally ahead, says in a mass email: \u201cRight now, there are still many ballots to be counted and the race is too close to be called.\u201d This is the seat Democrat Gabrielle Giffords held before she was seriously injured in the 2011 mass shooting in Tucson and, as I wrote about last month, the former congresswoman\u2019s political action committee controversially attempted to use gun reform to swing the election in favour of Barber, her former aide, who was also injured in the shooting. But Mexico is the main reason this race has come down to the wire. The district runs along the southern US border with Mexico and, as cattle ranchers told me when I visited the district, there has been a backlash against Democrats over lax border security. As the final figures trickle in, so the winners and losers give their respective speeches. A Texas town voted yesterday to ban fracking in its city limits, my colleague Suzanne Goldenberg writes, reporting on a midterm vote that rebuked a few very wealthy interests. \u201cIt should send a signal to industry that if the people in Texas \u2013 where fracking was invented \u2013 can\u2019t live with it, nobody can,\u201d said Sharon Wilson, the Texas organiser for EarthWorks, who lives in Denton. Denton remains a solidly Republican town, and oil companies reportedly spent $700,000 to defeat the ban, according to the Denton Record-Chronicle. \u201cIt was more like David and Godzilla then David and Goliath,\u201d Wilson said. But she said residents were fed up with the noise and disruption of fracking, and the constant traffic and fumes from wells and trucks operating in residential neighbourhoods. Similar measures both succeeded and failed in Ohio and California yesterday, depending on the county, but Suzanne reports that Denton\u2019s vote was particularly symbolic, as it\u2019s \u201cprobably the most heavily fracked town in the country\u201d. You can read the full piece here. The Democrats hold onto one more governor\u2019s mansion in a close race. OSCE observers found the role of money \u201cproblematic\u201d in the US midterms, although the good people who monitor elections around the world liked America\u2019s \u201ccommitment to democracy\u201d. Isabel Santos, leader of the OSCE PA observers, said: \u201cthe amount of money involved in campaigns has become truly staggering. With certain individuals and groups now spending millions on elections \u2013 amounts wildly beyond the capacity of average citizens \u2013 there is increasing inequality in the process.\u201d \u201cThe campaign was active and competitive, but often with negative advertising and mutual accusations lowering the quality of debate and turning voters off. Discussion of the real policy challenges facing the country suffered as a result.\u201d They were also none too pleased about new voter-ID laws. \u201cGovernments have a responsibility to facilitate voting for their population \u2026 the requirement in some states that voters must first acquire photo identification can potentially inhibit voting by some, particularly those at lower socio-economic levels,\u201d said Santos. Finally, observers dryly noted that despite \u201cextensive media coverage \u2026 actual interest of the public appeared limited\u201d. New Jersey\u2019s Republican governor, Chris Christie, is out and about on major morning shows, saying the results are \u201cabsolutely fabulous\u201d and taking a victory lap on behalf of his party. He insists it\u2019s not about him. To NBC: \u201cIf a blue-state governor like me is chairman of the [Republican Governors Association], I work to make the decisions to spend money in states like that and we get victories, that\u2019s a great day \u2026 People want to get things done.\u201d To ABC: \u201cThe president took a beating last night, and the fact is, you\u2019ve got to sit down then with the folks on the other side and say to them, \u2018OK, let\u2019s see what we can agree on together.\u2019 And I think the president needs to lead. I\u2019ve been urging him to do that for years. He needs to lead and work with these folks now.\u201d About the 2016 presidential race: \u201cI haven\u2019t had time to think about [2016]. I\u2019m on two hours sleep, so fair to say what I\u2019m looking for is a nap.\u201d To Fox News: \u201cI love that map this morning. It looks absolutely fabulous I\u2019ve gotta tell you, I think the president has less to do with what we did last night. I think what governors did last night was to show on their own individual records that they can do a great job and people returned them to office.\u201d \u201c[It\u2019s] about our candidates. It\u2019s not about me. I was happy to help. I\u2019m glad to have their confidence. But that\u2019s all it is.\u201d Barack Obama\u2019s bad day just got marginally worse: Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin has been declared Forbes\u2019 most powerful person of 2014, beating the US president to the top spot. China\u2019s Xi Jinping ranked third. Putin, who did not have to sway a single North Carolina voter to do it, is surely framing the article for his office wall now. Who needs elections when there are financial magazines to anoint you? An ironic point made by adapting a famous image? Keep innovating, Time. Perhaps more substantially, McConnell did actually tell Time a few semi-interesting things, like how he\u2019s planning to bring up votes on \u201capproving the Keystone XL pipeline, repealing the medical device tax, trying to restore the 40-hour work week, trying to get rid of the individual mandate.\u201d \u201cAfter all, [Obama\u2019s] going to be there for two more years. Maybe there are things that we can agree on. I\u2019ll give you a couple of examples where there may be areas of agreement: comprehensive tax reform and trade agreements. Most of my members think that America\u2019s a winner in international trade. The president hasn\u2019t sent us a single trade bill in six years. I hope he\u2019ll do that.\u201d McConnell also said he wouldn\u2019t pursue a repeal of Obamacare or a government shutdown: \u201cRemember me? I\u2019m the guy that gets us out of government shutdowns.\u201d It\u2019s time for a \u201cbattle for soul of the GOP\u201d, Politico reports, so breathless with excitement it didn\u2019t even have time for the definite article. The DC magazine sees the Ted Cruz-ade (has that not caught on yet?) for rightwing policies pitted against Republican moderates, with Mitch McConnell as the wily man in the middle. \u201cNow is the time for tax reform. Now is the time for regulatory reform. Now is the time to go after and do everything humanly possible to repeal Obamacare. Now is the time to stand up to the president and say, \u2018No more amnesty,\u2019\u201d Cruz said. And Texas Governor Rick Perry, another likely 2016 contender, declared it was \u201ctime to lead and craft common-sense policies that make America energy independent, bring sanity to our Tax Code, and secure our border once and for all.\u201d McConnell sounded a practical note on Tuesday as he stressed the need to work with Obama when possible. \u201cI don\u2019t expect the president to wake up tomorrow and view the world any differently than he did when he woke up this morning. He knows I won\u2019t either. But I do think we have an obligation to work together on issues where we can agree,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cJust because we have a two-party system doesn\u2019t mean we have to be in perpetual conflict.\u201d Prognostication about the next two years has begun in earnest, with many seeing two scenarios head, \u201cone dark, one rosy\u201d as the New Yorker\u2019s Evan Osnos puts it: The rosy scenario begins with the true, if glib-sounding, observation that the Senate is already in a state of gridlock. Perhaps now, with Republicans no longer only an opposition party, both sides will see an incentive to deal. McConnell, the theory goes, will understand that he has as little as two years to make his mark as leader, opposite a president in the same predicament. Make no mistake: this is not likely to produce major legislation from the Democrats\u2019 agenda \u2013 a higher minimum wage, equal pay for women, affordable college tuition \u2013 but it could raise the faint spectre of compromise over lower-hanging goals such as a tax overhaul, trade promotion, or investment in roads and bridges. My money is on the darker scenario, which holds that we are entering a period of paralysis that will be the functional equivalent of turning down the radiators and draining the pipes in the Capitol until the 2016 election. McConnell has told big donors that he will \u201cwork at every turn to thwart the Obama agenda, and use appropriations and the budget process to force the president to roll back key elements of Obamacare, to water down Dodd-Frank, to tilt toward coal \u2026 to move forward on the Keystone XL pipeline, and to stop Environmental Protection Agency action on climate change,\u201d according to the National Journal. Public service announcement: there are just 438 days until the Iowa caucuses. And finally: In Massachusetts, Democratic candidate Martha Coakley is bowing to the inevitable in the governor\u2019s race there. Call it the Curse of Obama, via USA Today: Many Democratic candidates didn\u2019t want to campaign with President Obama this election season, and the results show why. Most of the candidates Obama did appear with lost. Of the eight candidates who held rallies featuring the president, five went down to defeat on Tuesday. All five were gubernatorial candidates: Incumbent Pat Quinn in Illinois, Anthony Brown in Maryland, Mary Burke in Wisconsin, Mike Michaud in Maine, and Mark Schauer in Michigan. The New York Times in full dead-pan mode, reporting on Joni Ernst\u2019s win in Iowa: Ms Ernst gained national prominence for commercials in which she brandished a gun and talked about castrating pigs. That would be this ad. From the Republican camp, the Washington Examiner\u2019s Byron York lists five Democratic party myths that he says were exploded by the midterm election result. Number one: \u201cThe election wouldn\u2019t be a referendum on President Obama\u201d: Every day on the stump, Republican candidates pressed the point that their Democratic opponents voted for the Obama agenda nearly all the time. \u201cKay Hagan has voted for President Obama\u2019s failed partisan agenda 95% of the time,\u201d said Thom Tillis, who defeated the incumbent Democrat in North Carolina. Mark Pryor \u201cvotes with Barack Obama 93% of the time,\u201d said Tom Cotton, who defeated the incumbent Democrat in Arkansas. \u201cMark Udall has voted with [Obama] 99% of the time,\u201d said Cory Gardner, who defeated the incumbent Democrat in Colorado. The US political Twitterati are very excited by this Washington Post behind the scenes piece, which has more inside baseball than, well, a game of baseball. But it does have some nuggets: Minutes after landing at Reagan National Airport one day early this year, many GOP Senate hopefuls found themselves besieged at baggage claim by people with cameras yelling questions at them about abortion and rape. This was no impromptu news conference but rather Republican staffers in disguise, trying to shock the candidates into realizing the intensity of what lay before them. From the airport, the startled candidates were whisked off to NRSC headquarters for a series of meetings. There were policy briefings led by Lanhee Chen, Mitt Romney\u2019s former policy director, as well as communications boot camps and media training from Roger Ailes associate Jon Kraushar, who has mentored Fox News personalities. Here\u2019s how things stand at 8am ET or 1pm GMT, as the smoke clears after the Republican triumph in the 2014 midterm elections: President Obama is to appear before the media at the White House this afternoon to discuss the midterm election result. Now facing opposition majorities in both branches of Congress, the challenge for Obama will be to refocus his presidency and political effort against almost certain Republican intransigence. Republicans took firm control of the US Senate, with projections showing the GOP likely to have an eight-seat majority. Currently the GOP has won or is likely to hold 53 Senate seats, leaving the Democratic party with 46. The remaining undecided Senate seat will be decided by a run-off election in Louisiana next month \u2013 although the Republicans are also favoured to win that. In the House of Representatives the Republicans made further gains of at least nine seats, on top of those they made in 2010 and 2012, giving them their biggest majority in the chamber since the 1950s. With five House races still too close to call, the Republicans are likely to win 247 seats, while the Democrats have 183. Many pre-election opinion polls drastically underplayed the extent of the Republican victory, with what were expected to be close races turning out to be easy victories. In North Carolina, polls that showed Democratic Senator Kay Hagan holding her seat were well off the mark, while expectations that Republican Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell faced a tough re-election battle turned out to be inaccurate. The Republicans also toppled Democratic contenders in a number of hard-fought governorship races, even in Democratic bastions in New England and the east coast, with Republicans holding Maine and capturing the Massachusetts state house. Democratic activists and campaigners began to dissect the scale of the loss, with exit polls showing that the Republican tactic of tying the party to President Obama was very successful: nearly 60% of voters said they were dissatisfied or angry with the Obama administration. Winning Republicans candidates included the youngest woman elected to Congress, the first black female Republican elected to Congress, the first African American elected to the US Senate from a southern state, and the first female combat veteran elected to the Senate. The White House announces that Barack Obama will face the cameras later this afternoon, presumably to publicly address the midterm election result. Or maybe just chat about the weather, who knows. A sliver of good news for Democrats: in Connecticut, their candidate running for re-election, Dannel Malloy, is claiming victory in a close race: As of 5.30am, the race for governor in Connecticut still has not been called. Malloy was at 51% while Foley held 48%. Results from Hartford and New Haven have not yet been added to the mix. That didn\u2019t stop Malloy from declaring victory overnight, despite numbers showing a neck and neck race. It\u2019s because Hartford and New Haven are typically Democratic strongholds. But really, if a Democrat winning Connecticut is the night\u2019s good news, then the rest of the night has been a disaster. Top marks go to Rand Paul, the GOP senator from Kentucky, for his shameless attempt to pivot as quickly as possible to 2016. He told AP: Tonight was really a referendum not only on the president\u2019s policies, but really a referendum on Hillary Clinton. Nice try Rand, even if that sounds like nonsense. He\u2019s been on the case via Twitter as well. That Alaska Senate result can\u2019t be far away. The Associated Press has a longer look at the exit poll results to divine why the Republicans did so well last night: Republicans took control of Congress with a big push from voters who feel they\u2019ve been left behind in the nation\u2019s gradual economic recovery, exit polls show. Although they turned against President Barack Obama and Democrats, gloomy voters also expressed scant confidence in Republican leaders. Almost half say their own family\u2019s financial situation hasn\u2019t improved much over the past two years, and a fourth say it\u2019s gotten worse. Those who said their finances were worse supported Republican congressional candidates by more than a 2-1 margin. Who voted and how: Democrats lost some of the female support that helped re-elect Obama and Senate Democrats in 2012. Still, more women supported Democrats than in 2010. Men leaned Republican. White voters favored Republicans by a 22-point margin. Two-thirds of Hispanics voted Democratic in House races, and black voters were overwhelmingly for the Democrats. Republicans did better among married people, whether male or female, and rural residents. Single women and city dwellers were especially Democratic. Regular churchgoers favored Republicans, while those who never attend religious services overwhelmingly voted for Democrats. Voters with incomes under $50,000 generally favored Democrats, while those who earn more tended to support Republicans. It is sounding like it\u2019s all over in Alaska \u2013 another Senate seat turnover for the GOP: Republican US Senate candidate Dan Sullivan appeared to grab an insurmountable lead over incumbent Democratic Senator Mark Begich early Wednesday, with 97% of Alaska\u2019s precincts reporting. With 427 of 441 precincts counted, Sullivan led 49% to 45%. The margin remained essentially the same from the first returns early in the evening. Meanwhile, the Alaska governor\u2019s race is dragging on, where the Republicans are being edged out by an independent with Democratic support: Republican Governor Sean Parnell\u2019s reelection bid was faltering Tuesday night as independent Bill Walker held a slim but steady lead with nearly three-fourths of Alaska\u2019s precincts counted. Unofficial returns had Walker up by just over 1,500 votes with some 74% of the state\u2019s far flung precincts reporting. In percentage terms, Walker\u2019s lead was narrow: 47.7% to Parnell\u2019s 46.8%. The contest was turning into an Alaska nail biter. Speaking of dead candidates: Massachusetts Democrat Martha Coakley should win some sort of special award for her reverse Midas touch, since everything she touches turns to poo. In 2010 Coakley\u2019s stone-cold campaign lost Ted Kennedy\u2019s Senate seat to Scott Brown and the Republicans. And now Coakley is losing to the Republicans again, as she is trailing in the gubernatorial elections there. It\u2019s still tight, with Republican candidate Charlie Baker leading Coakley by 48.4% to 46.7%, so Coakley isn\u2019t conceding yet. But Baker has declared victory, and is backed by AP and all the news networks. Election night turned into a wake for the Democratic party. But despite the tidal wave of Republican results, there are still parts of the US that will elect Democrats even if they are dead, such as Washington state: There\u2019s an unusual twist in the race for state house in the 30th district of Federal Way. The Democratic incumbent died from cancer last week, but Rep Roger Freeman\u2019s name is still on the ballot \u2013 and he\u2019s still getting votes. There\u2019s a quote from the dead candidate\u2019s campaign, saying it\u2019s what he would have wanted. Erick Erickson, the reddest of Red State Republicans, has plenty to say about the Republican triumph and liberal media bias, as you might expect. I\u2019ll spare you the part about \u201cAbortion Barbie\u201d but he makes this point: In Florida, Rick Scott beat Charlie Crist. Were you to believe the media for the past three months, there was no way Scott could get re-elected. Likewise, the media spent months salivating over Democrats Allison Grimes, Wendy Davis, and Michelle Nunn. All three women lost. Meanwhile, the GOP is sending the first black female Republican to Congress with Mia Love. They\u2019re sending conservative legend Barbara Comstock who won in Northern Virginia. And they\u2019re sending veteran Joni Ernst from Iowa. Ernst, by the way, ran one of the best campaigns in America. But the media ignored the Republican women, focusing instead on the fashion choices of losing Democrats who stroked their world view. By the way, not only did Wendy Davis lose the gubernatorial election in Texas, but her State Senate seat flipped to the GOP\u2019s tea party candidate, Konni Burton. Mia Love becomes the first black Republican congresswoman in American history, after she won a seat in Utah at the second attempt. Everything you wanted to know about Love via Buzzfeed. Maybe this isn\u2019t the best time for this otherwise sweet video to be surfacing, but here\u2019s Barack Obama dancing. I suspect there won\u2019t be much dancing in the next few days. Or months. An update on results that are still to be counted: Virginia senate seat Connecticut governor Colorado governor Alaska governor and senate seat The Guardian\u2019s Paul Lewis has just filed his final take of the night stateside, surveying the smoking ruins of the 2014 Democratic party campaign: President Barack Obama\u2019s party awoke on Wednesday to the political equivalent of a pounding hangover; a wave of defeats more numerous and deeper than many Democrats had feared. Republicans gained at least seven Senate seats from Democrats, cementing the GOP power base on Capitol Hill and boosting the party\u2019s standing ahead of the 2016 presidential elections. On a night of few positives for Democrats, Republicans also outperformed Democrats in most of the 36 governors races, clinching stunning victories in Democratic strongholds such as Massachusetts, Maryland and Illinois. \u201cThis is ugly,\u201d one top Democrat involved in the party\u2019s election strategy told the Guardian in the early hours of Wednesday morning. \u201cIt is so much worse than we expected.\u201d The defeat is a major blow to the president, whose low approval ratings contributed heavily to his party\u2019s electoral drubbing. Obama, an already isolated and unpopular president, must now see out his remaining two years in the White House with his Republican opponents controlling both branches of Congress. The nature of the rout will be cause for concern for Hillary Clinton, the heir-apparent for the Democratic presidential nomination who, along with her husband, former president Bill Clinton, stumped for several of the party\u2019s Senate candidates who lost badly. The Washington Post is also talking up Scott Walker\u2019s chances as a Republican presidential nominee in 2016: Walker\u2019s success provides a compelling rationale for an expected 2016 White House bid: that he won two elections and fended off a 2012 recall effort in a state that twice voted for Obama. \u201cHe can say to Republican activists around the country, \u2018I won three close races in a swing state,\u2019 \u201d said Mike Wagner, an assistant professor of journalism who studies political communication and elections at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. Tim Phillips, president of the conservative advocacy group Americans for Prosperity, said Walker now has a national profile with major donors and party activists, making him a \u201cformidable\u201d presidential contender. \u201cMany donors already know him and respect what he\u2019s done, so he will be able to instantly get in the door,\u201d Phillips said. Why did the Democrats do so badly? The Washington Post\u2019s Dan Balz compares 2014 and the last midterm elections in 2010, and puts the 2014 result down to the iron laws of electoral demography: Fundamentals favored the Republicans, from the traditional midterm advantage for the party that does not hold the White House to the low regard in which voters held the president. Added to that was a Senate map that was heavily tilted in favor of the GOP, so much so that it was always possible for Republicans to capture control simply by winning states carried by GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney in 2012. Though winning in some of those red states would require defeating Democratic incumbents, both parties also were aware that in a polarized nation, states increasingly vote the same way in Senate elections as they do in presidential elections. The Associated Press lists the five ways US politics will play out after the 2014 midterms, including this: Obama put off a number of high-profile decisions until after the election. But time is up. And those decisions only become more politically fraught with Republicans in full control of Congress. Republicans are likely to insist that Obama hold off on nominating a new attorney general until after the Senate is seated. That would subject Obama\u2019s nominee to a GOP-controlled confirmation fight. Obama has also pledged to act unilaterally by year\u2019s end on immigration, but an end-run around Congress becomes harder to defend now that voters have ousted so many Democrats. Obama must also decide how to handle a flurry of bills that Republicans may pass to try to force Obama\u2019s hand on issues like the Keystone XL pipeline and health care. Until now, Obama has only used his veto pen twice. Perhaps the upset of the night was Republican Larry Hogan winning the election to be Maryland\u2019s next governor \u2013 given that Maryland is a solid east coast blue state. Hogan had no money and little help from national Republicans. But he did campaign very effectively \u2013 and his team made this masterclass in how to do TV advertising. Looking ahead to the 2016 presidential election \u2013 campaigning for which begins today, in one for or another \u2013 get used to hearing the name of Wisconsin governor Scott Walker as the potential Republican nominee. Here\u2019s the New York Times: Just after Mr Walker won the recall election, Republicans began mentioning him among a list of possible candidates for president in 2016. Mr Walker\u2019s success at pushing through a conservative agenda, then surviving a recall challenge in a state that twice favored President Obama gave him a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 Republicans saw as appealing for a White House run. Yet Mr Walker needed to win a second term as governor on Tuesday to remain viable in that regard, and some political analysts said a decisive margin of victory was needed to bolster the case for a future presidential run. They are still counting votes in Wisconsin but Walker is coasting to victory by around five percentage points. That\u2019s a decisive margin all right. And so it begins: Some key points to note: Hillary Clinton will be running against an actual person; 2014 midterm voters are not a representative sample of the 2016 voting population; the 2016 presidential election is two years away. Two things to look forward to: long, hand-wringing pieces about where the Democratic party went wrong, and equally long, over-enthusiastic features about the Republican party machine behind the scenes. The Washington Post is first out of the block with one of both types: Eleven hundred miles away in Richmond, Virginia, Chris LaCivita, a hard-charging Republican fixer, was on his back deck picking apart steamed crabs and drinking beer with friends when he got the order to fly to Kansas. The Republican rescue was underway. Then there are some quotes from Harry Reid\u2019s chief of staff, blaming the White House: At a March 4 Oval Office meeting, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev) and other Senate leaders pleaded with Obama to transfer millions in party funds and to also help raise money for an outside group. \u201cWe were never going to get on the same page,\u201d said David Krone, Reid\u2019s chief of staff. \u201cWe were beating our heads against the wall.\u201d There will be plenty more like this in the coming days. Meanwhile, in the very swingy swing state of Nevada, the scale of the local Republican triumph has surprised even Jon Ralston, the \u00e9minence grise of Nevada state politics: What does this all mean for the 2016 presidential elections, you ask? Not as much as you might think, according to this analysis in the Los Angeles Times: Even before the votes were counted, some of the GOP\u2019s leading strategists had begun to warn that those victories could blind Republicans to hard problems that the 2014 campaign had done almost nothing to solve. The barriers to a Republican victory in a presidential election remain formidable, they said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be gloating over the fact of winning red states,\u201d said Republican pollster Neil Newhouse, noting that this year\u2019s Senate battles mostly took place in reliably conservative states in the South and interior West. \u201cThat\u2019s not a very high bar.\u201d One-third of the Senate comes up for reelection every two years, and by luck of the draw, the states in this year\u2019s batch are disproportionately conservative. Indeed, of the three classes of Senate seats, this year\u2019s group has been the least representative of the country over the last few election cycles, according to an analysis of election data by Patrick J Egan, a political scientist at New York University. Yes this result is a wipeout or a rout or whatever you would like to call it \u2013 but it was fighting on Republican turf, largely, thanks to a set of circumstances that saw Democratic senators elected at the high-tide of Obamarama in 2008 defending their seats once the tide had gone out. In other news: Jerry Brown was easily re-elected as governor of California, as Democrats won other state-wide races. California has 55 electoral college votes. Iowa has six, to put things into perspective. Headlines one only sees in US elections: Measure to restrict bear-hunting practices fails in Maine That would be the Maine Bear Hunting Ban Initiative, outlawing the use of pizza as bear-bait. This tells you a lot about Maine. There is at least one gubernatorial race outstanding where the Democrats might pull off a victory, and one that looked pretty unlikely given the scale of the wipeout elsewhere. It\u2019s in Colorado, where incumbent governor John Hickenlooper is just a hair behind his Republican challenger Bob Beauprez (who would make an excellent presidential candidate with a name like that). Since the Democratic parts of Colorado are the slowest at counting their votes, it looks like Hickenlooper is going to be safe. And if you are looking for silver linings it\u2019s this: Colorado is a very swingy swing state so its good for the Democratic party\u2019s 2016 presidential hopes. The US Republican party has outperformed even its wildest expectations in the 2014 midterm elections, holding or capturing a swathe of seats across the US that will enable it to comfortably take control of both houses of Congress. Meanwhile, the Democratic party remains bewildered by the scale of the loss, as thoughts turn to the 2016 presidential elections Here\u2019s a summary of what happened last night and this morning: Republicans were expected to pick up around 7-9 seats in the Senate and up to 15 in the House of Representatives, although the final tally is unclear, with results still outstanding in the Virginia and Alaska Senate races. Mitch McConnell will be the new Republican majority leader in the Senate after his win in Georgia. Republican Senate candidates won in North Carolina, Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas and Iowa, while Louisiana will be decided in a runoff election. The Republicans also outperformed in the governor\u2019s races, taking Maryland in an upset result, holding Maine and winning in Florida, Michigan and Wisconsin. Only in Colorado are the Democrats likely to win a contested race. There was little good news for Democrats. Senator Jeanne Shaheen held on in New Hampshire, while progressive minimum wage laws passed in Arkansas, Illinois and South Dakota. Oregon and Washington DC saw marijuana legalisation approved by voters, while Florida voted against decriminalising medical marijuana."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
