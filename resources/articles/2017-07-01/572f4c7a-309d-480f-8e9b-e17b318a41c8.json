Norway lost against the hosts, Holland, in their opening game and Belgium yesterday celebrated their first win in the tournament\u2019s history after second-half goals from Elke van Gorp, who made the most of a goalkeeping error on the hour, and Janice Cayman, who was left unmarked in the area to head home a long throw in the 67th minute. \u201cThe players had to win \u2013 it was part of the learning process playing in such a tournament,\u201d said the Belgium coach, Ives Serneels. More than 6,000 Belgium fans travelled for the match in Breda. Holland beat Denmark 1-0 after withstanding a fierce comeback by the Danes in the second period, but their six points do not yet guarantee qualification. \u201cIt\u2019s a strange, mixed feeling,\u201d said the Dutch coach, Sarina Wiegman, after the victory in Rotterdam. Holland play Belgium in their final group game needing a point to qualify. Holland dominated the first half and deservedly took the lead through Sherida Spitse, who struck from the penalty spot after Danielle van de Donk was fouled. But they had their goalkeeper, Arsenal\u2019s Sari van Veenendaal, to thank for preserving their lead as she denied the Danish attack repeatedly after the break. \u201cWe created some chances to score, but the Dutch goalkeeper had a great night and made some great saves,\u201d said the Denmark coach, Nils Nielsen. \u201cThe way the Dutch played is part of their football culture. They play the same football as the men\u2019s team and I like to watch that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
