What better place to assess such a demand than in the new Mus\u00e9e International de la R\u00e9forme in Geneva? Here familiar portraits of Luther and Calvin magically appear in a mirror to lip-synch the glories of the 16th-century Reformation - a revolution against a corrupt Catholic church that ripped off the gullible by selling passports to heaven. By translating the Bible into the vernacular (one of the earliest and most influential English Bibles was produced in Geneva in 1560), the reformers bypassed the power of the Catholic clergy to interpret the word of God to ordinary believers. The parallels with a religion that refuses to accept the authenticity of translations of the Qur'an are superficially powerful. Even so, Islam already resembles a reformed religion a great deal more than Rushdie acknowledges. Reformation pamphleteers railed against the papacy as the whore of Babylon, yet there is no equivalent centralised authority in Islam. Nor is there a hierarchical clerical establishment. The sober dress of Muslim leaders and the absence of fancy vestments to mark them out as special are clearly reminiscent of post-Reformation austerity. So too is the thoroughgoing commitment to iconoclasm. On August 6 the Independent's front page lamented what it called \"The destruction of Mecca\". \"Historic Mecca, the cradle of Islam, is being buried in an unprecedented onslaught by religious zealots,\" it explained. The newspaper cast Muslim iconoclasts as philistines mindlessly destroying their own culture. In fact there is nothing \"unprecedented\" about religious iconoclasm, nor is it always an act of unthinking fundamentalism. Iconoclasm is at the heart of the Abrahamic faiths and is as old as the Ten Commandments. Long before Marxists such as Georg Lukacs started warning about reification - turning something living into a thing or commodity - the Abrahamic faiths knew that God necessarily remains beyond the reach of human formulation and therefore sharp and circumscribed descriptions are bound to mislead. Making God into some sort of thing, giving God a definite shape and category, is to supplant the essentially mysterious with a dangerous human fabrication, a golden calf. The moral of iconoclasm is that we must distrust our images, even our treasured mental images, of the divine, which is why iconoclasm can never be simply the preserve of the religious zealot destroying graven images. The reformers didn't smash stained-glass windows as an act of cultural vandalism: they wanted to warn against falling in love with our images of God - infused as they are with our own political and social agendas - rather than with the utterly mysterious God who can never be captured in paint or statue or concrete. Applying this same logic to religious texts is the beginning of a much-needed modesty within religious conviction. No true iconoclast could ever believe he knew God's mind sufficiently to plant a bomb on a tube. But the problem with the reformers is that they never came to appreciate that texts require iconoclastic deconstruction. Like most reformed churches, the cathedral in Geneva places the Bible at the dramatic centre of the building. What the reformed traditions often don't get is that they have given up worshipping images only to worship a book. At this point Salman Rushdie's call for a reformed Islam dangerously reinforces the tendency for religions such as Christianity and Islam to make a fetish of the written word - presumably hardly Rushdie's intention at all. For there can be few more chilling examples of theocratic fascism than Calvin's Geneva. In toppling the authority of the clergy, he made it the responsibility of the civil magistrates to enforce the word of God. Spon, in his History of Geneva, writes: \"In the year 1560, a citizen [of Geneva], having been condemned to the lash by the small council, for the crime of adultery, appealed from its sentence to the Two Hundred. His case was reconsidered, and the council, knowing that he had before committed the offence, and been against caught therein, condemned him to death, to the great astonishment of the criminal.\" Elsewhere, Picot observes, \"There were children publicly scourged, and hung, for having called their mother she-devil and thief. When the child had not attained the age of reason, they hung him by the armpits, to manifest that he deserved death.\" Quite clearly, the fear that western liberals have of sharia law can hardly be appeased with reference to a reformed polity. Rushdie's suggestion that a reformed Islam might find a way beyond the besetting sins of anti-semitism, sexism and homophobia is also, alas, unlikely. Luther himself was famously and virulently anti-semitic. The Reformation did little for women, and the place to find the most neanderthal religious homophobia in Britain today is in an organisation called Reform. Until the Reformation finishes its work and trains its powerful commitment to iconoclasm on the sources of its own prejudice it will hardly be a model to hold up for other religious traditions to follow. \u00b7 Giles Fraser is vicar of Putney and a lecturer in philosophy at Wadham College, Oxford giles.fraser@btinternet.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
