The prospect of boosting the Burmese junta's international respectability by giving it the helm is an embarrassing one for members of the 10-state trade and security bloc pledged to non-interference in each other's internal affairs. The regime's human rights abuses and its persecution of the Nobel peace prizewinner, Aung San Suu Kyi have made it a pariah in the west. The US, which classes Burma as an \"outpost of tyranny\", and the EU have warned of curtailed cooperation should Burma get Asean's nod. But the dispute, though spectacular, has threatened to hide another contentious Mactan agenda item of potentially far greater long-term significance for Asia. It is a proposal that Asean's members - Brunei, Burma, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam - join the economic giants China, Japan and South Korea, and possibly other countries, in a new and much more powerful regional organisation. Regional analysts say this December's ground-breaking East Asia Summit in Kuala Lumpur could pave the way for the eventual creation of a permanent East Asian Community, the equivalent of the European Union or, in its initial stages at least, of the former European Economic Community. Like the EEC of old, trade is giving impetus to enlargement. Bilateral and multilateral free trade agreements and joint business ventures are proliferating the region at breathtaking speed. Enhanced cooperation on terrorism and security is another motivation. But unlike the EU, shared adherence to democratic values and human rights is not a wholly agreed objective, as China's prospective membership and the rift over Burma show. There are deep differences too on how a future East Asian community would be defined geographically. Pro-western countries such as Singapore and Japan say Australia and New Zealand should be included. Others want India to join the party. Australia and New Zealand were told yesterday they could attend the summit if they first signed Asean's non-aggression treaty. During a post-tsunami thank-you visit to Canberra last week, the Indonesian president, Suslio Bambang Yudhoyono, backed Australian membership. The prime minister, John Howard, said Australia \"would be very happy to participate, but we are not knocking on doors begging\". All the same Mr Howard, who has previously emphasised ties with the US and antagonised his Asian neighbours with talk of pre-emptive anti-terrorist strikes, is increasingly interested in enhanced access to booming regional markets. Australia's trade with China has trebled in the past decade, and Mr Howard will visit Beijing this month in pursuit of a bilateral free trade agreement. Old fears and present-day tensions further bedevil ambitions for an East Asia community on the European model, said Francis Kan of Chengchi University in Taipei. \"We can look at the methods and aims of the EU's evolution,\" he said. \"We can see how the French and Germans aimed to avoid a new war and minimise their differences. \"But in Europe you don't have a country like China. What do we do about standards of democracy and human rights? In Europe the cold war ended 15 years ago. Many small cold wars still linger in this part of the world - the nuclear stand-off in South Asia, North Korea, Taiwan and China, island disputes, and terrorism in south-east Asia.\" For its part China, backed by Malaysia among others, opposes Australian and Indian membership. This has increased worries in Tokyo and smaller countries such as Vietnam that Beijing would dominate any new organisation and use it to promote its long-term aim of reducing US influence in Asia. Washington is said to hope the whole idea of an East Asia community that excludes the US will be confounded by its own contradictions. But European countries such as France would be likely to welcome a new regional bloc as a way of boosting their vision of a multipolar world. Speaking in Tokyo last month, Condoleezza Rice, the US secretary of state, predicted that freer trade would in any case inevitably bring necessary political reform in its wake. \"Economic and political openness cannot long be separated,\" she said. \"Even China must eventually embrace some form of open, genuinely representative government if it is to reap the benefits and meet the challenges of a globalising world.\" But that change could be some time in coming. Given the violent upsurge in nationalist tension between Japan and China, any forum that binds those old enemies more closely in the short term may be thought worth pursuing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
