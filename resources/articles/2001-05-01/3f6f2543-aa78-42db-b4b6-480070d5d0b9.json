They talk of the contribution made by immigrants and yet in power gave us the British Nationality Act and the most racist of 20th-century governments. Under a Hague administration, asylum seekers are to be imprisoned without trial in a grotesque parody of the regimes they fled from in the first place. Tony Blair told us at last year's Labour party conference that if we want racism, \"vote for the other guy - I can't do it\". Meanwhile, his home secretary demonises refugees, denies them human rights and stands condemned by the United Nations. Jack Straw's message is indisputable: we do not want you, get off our land. The world has changed, even if our politicians refuse to accept it. European Union citizens have free access to live and work in Britain without impediment. Why, in a country with skills and labour shortages, can we not stretch the net wider? Why do we play the racists' game and discriminate between \"legitimate\" and \"bogus\" asylum seekers? Why not remove the distinction and welcome immigrants as human beings who can contribute to our country? Ian McKay London \u0095 In support of putting asylum seekers into purpose-built detention centres, Ann Widdecombe implies that local opposition is an obstacle to be overcome: \"There is always some degree of local resistance. But life is a series of obstacles you have to get over.\" As a legal representative for asylum seekers, I always ensure that I advise my successful clients (those who have been granted refugee status) that one of their new rights in this country is the right to vote. Let's hope they use it. Lisa Hassan Scott Dinas Powys, South Glamorgan \u0095 You print a picture of a 1997 National Front march in Dover, where William Hague unveiled his asylum policy, illustrating how the asylum issue allows mainstream politicians to occupy ground that had previously been occupied by neo-fascists. However, it is not just the Tories who have travelled this path. Last year Jack Straw was at Dover for the cameras, dressed up like an immigration official and boasting of (among other measures) new electronic sniffing devices that could detect human smells. Within weeks, 58 Chinese were found dead within a hermetically sealed container. Both main parties are recklessly creating an anti-immigration culture of which the National Front would be proud. When you point the finger, you should point it both ways. Mike Diboll London M@diboll.org.uk \u0095 William Hague's \"safe countries\" policy looks forward to the time when we have regional government and certain regions will be deemed incapable of \"generating refugees\". Therefore someone from the north-east, south Wales or some other suitably depressed area will not be able to \"migrate\" to wealthier areas,thereby maintaining house prices and a suitably high level of employment and earnings. Nick Stringer Swansea nickmads@cwcom.net \u0095 It has been suggested that the UK is targeted by illegal immigrants because, unlike other EU states, we do not require our citizens to carry ID cards. These apparently make countries less attractive to the organised gangs who deal in smuggling people. If ID cards would help in solving the problem, then why haven't any of the parties suggested it during the campaign?
