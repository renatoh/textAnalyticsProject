The 'Biometric 48 Page Passport' is identical to the standard one except in size, and is 'biometric' because, like all new UK passports, it incorporates measurement data from the holder's facial photo. It costs \u00a377, compared with \u00a366 for the standard size, and is available from tomorrow from www.passport.gov.uk."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
