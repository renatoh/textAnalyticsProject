Teaforthree may die on Saturday, at Aintree. He has about a 5% \u2013 one-in-20 \u2013 chance of dying, based on the fatality statistics from the past two years. They get better if you go back further, admittedly, becoming more like one in 40. But I don't think I would have an operation with that level of risk, let alone do something that's supposed to be fun, such as sport. Teaforthree doesn't have the choice, though, being a horse. How to Win the Grand National (Channel 4) doesn't dwell on that too much, or whether the race should or shouldn't happen. This is, after all, the beginning of Channel 4's coverage, after more than 50 years of being shown by the BBC. It needs to be stirring and upbeat. And it is. Rugged TV vet Mark Evans visits stables and yards; he examines the training, the jumping, takeoff and landing, stamina and genetics. He talks to jockeys, to AP McCoy and Bob Champion, who beat cancer and then the field on Aldaniti. Richard Pitman is especially good. He was miles clear on Crisp, the favourite in 1973, with not very far to go. Then he heard drrrrrm drrrrrm, the hooves of the horse behind, and prrrrrr prrrrr as it exhaled through its nostrils. The two sounds were horrible, says Pitman, because they were getting louder. The horse behind was Red Rum, of course, who would win not just that race but two more Grand Nationals, as well coming second twice. It's exciting just hearing him describe it. It all is \u2013 the magnificent horses, the montages and slow motion shots, the spectacle. I've always enjoyed the Grand National. It's the only horse race that's even remotely on my radar; I've even been a couple of times. But in the past two years, I've begun to feel uneasy about it. And I think that reflects a small but perceptible shift in public feeling: people are beginning to ask themselves if, in the 21st century, this event is acceptable. How to Win the Grand National? Well, if you're the horse, the first thing you really need is not to die."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
