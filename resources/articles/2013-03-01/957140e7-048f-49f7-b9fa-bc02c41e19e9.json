Since announcing Ferdinand's inclusion in his squad on Thursday, Roy Hodgson had been engaged in a frantic effort to ensure Ferdinand would report for duty, assuring Ferguson and Manchester United's medical staff that the 34-year-old's fitness regime would not be disrupted by the World Cup double header with San Marino and Montenegro. While it is understood that, when he woke on Saturday, Ferdinand was leaning towards rejecting Hodgson's offer of an international comeback, the England manager's persuasive interventions appear to have proved decisive. After United's win, Ferguson was asked if Ferdinand would meet up with the squad. \"He will be joining up,\" he replied. Although Ferdinand has always stated he was keen to represent England again, he was also aware of his club duties and has a keen sense of loyalty to Ferguson. He felt less strongly towards Hodgson, especially given how the England manager discarded him ahead of Euro 2012 and chose John Terry instead."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
