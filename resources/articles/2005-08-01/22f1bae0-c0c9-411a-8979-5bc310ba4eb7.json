Rushen &amp; Diamonds found the gap of two divisions impossible to bridge with the visitors booking their passage into the second round of the Carling Cup with a 3-0 victory down the M1 in Northamptonshire. Andrew Morrell completed the scoring to give City their second three-goal win in four days, following a similar scoreline against Queens Park Rangers last weekend. Derby County, however, stumbled to a club two divisions below them when Grimsby Town won with an early Gary Jones goal at Pride Park. Jones volleyed home after 11 minutes to condemn Derby to their first defeat of the season. Jones found himself in space just inside the Rams' area and let fly with a well-struck right-footed drive which flew past Lee Grant in the home goal. Derby had a host of senior players in the starting line-up with their manager Phil Brown bringing on Grzegorz Rasiak at the interval but even the Poland striker could not conjure up an equaliser. Gary Taylor-Fletcher completed a second-half hat-trick in the last minute as Huddersfield Town won 4-2 at Chesterfield. Pawel Abbott had given Chesterfield the lead, but Derek Niven headed in an equaliser after Wayne Allison had flicked on a cross. Kevan Hurst then nudged the hosts ahead on the hour mark before Taylor-Fletcher's three- goal salvo. Cardiff City, 2-0 victors at Colchester United, have had an improved offer for the 22-year-old Hibernian striker Derek Riordan accepted by the Scottish Premier League club. Hibernian manager Tony Mowbray said: \"We all recognise that Derek is a talented player and we have made extensive efforts over a long period of time to agree a contract extension. Unfortunately Derek has made it clear that he sees his future elsewhere.\" Cardiff wraped up their victory in the first half with goals from Cameron Jerome and Darren Purse with a penalty. Purse opened the scoring in the 31st minute after Kemal Izzet fouled Jeff Whitley. The striker Jerome sealed the win three minutes later after rounding Dean Gerken and finding an empty net."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
