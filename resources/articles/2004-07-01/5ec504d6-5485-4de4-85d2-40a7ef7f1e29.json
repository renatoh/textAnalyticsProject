Pursuing her eight major championship, and second for this season, Sorenstam had a share of the lead with Scotland's Catriona Matthew. The Swede had an early start and took advantage of the warm, windless sunny conditions at Sunningdale. She birdied the second and third holes and, despite bogeys at the fourth and sixth, picked up more strokes around the turn. \"I'm very happy with my 68,\" Sorenstam said. \"It's one of the better starts in the championship for me. \"I wanted to take advantage of my (early) tee time. The conditions were great - not a breath of air. The greens were pure and they were really good scoring conditions.\" Playing partner Meg Mallon, who edged Sorenstam into second place for the last LPGA major, the U.S. Open on July 4, also began well with three birdies in the first six holes. But a bogey five followed by a double bogey six at the 10th and 11th ruined her card. She covered the back nine in 39 and wound up with a three-over 75. Juli Inkster, also playing with Sorenstam and Mallon, birdied four of the first six holes and was five-under after 10. But she also went bogey, double bogey at 12-13, and finished with two bogey fives for a one-under 71. Out on the course, Natalie Gulbis, who is chasing her first victory in two and a half years on the LPGA Tour, was five-under after 16 holes. The Californian birdied the first three holes and added two more at the 10th and 11th. Matthew, who tied for third and aced the 15th when the championship was last at Sunningdale three years ago, captured five birdies to take the clubhouse lead. Sorenstam won the Women's British Open last year at Royal Lytham and St. Annes to complete a career Grand Slam. She successfully defended her LPGA Championship title in June for her seventh major victory and has four LPGA Tour victories this year to push her career total to 52. The world No.1 has a chance this week to win all four major championships twice in a row, a feat accomplished only by Mickey Wright (1958-59 U.S. Open, '60-61 LPGA Championship, '61-62 Titleholders and '62-63 Western Open). Sorenstam also won the U.S. Open in 1995-96 and the Nabisco Championship in 2001-02."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
