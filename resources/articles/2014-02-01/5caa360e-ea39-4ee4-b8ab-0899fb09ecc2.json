In this exceptionally brutal assault, which was captured on video, the attackers beat three Ahmadiyah men to death and seriously injured five others. Gruesome footage of the violence circulated widely on the internet, shocking Indonesians and the world. Police ultimately used the video evidence to identify several perpetrators, 12 of whom were convicted but given lenient sentences from three to six months\u2019 imprisonment. Neighbouring governments like Australia have good reason for concern about the Indonesian government\u2019s apparently inability or unwillingness to protect the Ahmadiyah, a Muslim sect, and other religious minorities from bigoted thugs who act with apparent impunity. Two weeks ago, a survivor of that horrific attack, Acmad Masihuddin, accompanied me to visit several Ahmadiyah communities in the hills outside Jakarta. Masihuddin told me how that fateful day he tried to run away. Members of the mob caught him and dragged him back, stripping him to his underwear, and beat him with a hoe and machete, until a police officer pronounced him dead and put him in the back of a police van \u2013 saving his life. Masihuddin, whose injuries required two years of treatment, still suffers from headaches and lost partial sight in one of his eyes. Now he works for one of Indonesia\u2019s leading human rights groups, Kontras, to support victims of religious violence. Masihuddin told me, \u201cI am working for Kontras, because I want to stop this from happening again.\u201d Three years after what should have been Indonesia\u2019s wake up call to address religious violence, the Ahmadiyah and the country\u2019s other religious minorities are under threat. Across Indonesia, there are multiplying incidents of harassment, threats and violence against religious minorities including several Christian groups, Shia and the Ahmadiyah. These groups have become targets of Islamist militant groups who label most non-Muslims as \u201cinfidels,\u201d and Muslims who do not adhere to Sunni orthodoxy as \u201cblasphemers.\u201d Even Indonesia\u2019s atheists live in fear of such groups. Islamist militants have increasingly and often violently attacked Ahmadiyah since 2005 when Indonesia\u2019s Ulama council, the MUI (Majelis Ulama Indonesia), declared a fatwa, or religious edict, ruling that the Ahmadiyah community deviated from Qur'anic teachings. In 2008, the government passed a nationwide anti-Ahmadiyah decree than bans the Ahmadiyah from proselytising their faith. The government justified this decree on the basis of reducing violence and promoting religious harmony. Instead, the number of attacks has steadily risen and more than 30 towns, regencies and provinces across Indonesia have followed suit, with some outright banning the Ahmadiyah as West Java province has. I met with representatives of five Ahmadiyah communities in Sukadana, West Java, who described almost daily intimidation, harassment and discrimination, resulting in the closure of three Ahmadiyah mosques by local officials. Ulamas have preached sermons of hate and intolerance over loudspeakers and in some cases, started campaigns to avoid Ahmadiyah-owned businesses. \u201cI get jittery every time I hear the ulamas speaking over the loudspeaker,\u201d an Ahmadiyah woman told me. Some Ahmadiyah have found it difficult to find jobs. Several men described bureaucratic hurdles when dealing with local officials or requesting new identification documents or building permits. Some Ahmadiyah teachers have been pressured to convert to Sunni Islam or transferred to remote schools when they resisted. Ahmadiyah children have also been bullied by classmates and teachers have pressured them to denounce their \u201cheretical\u201d religious views. Even hospitals are unwilling to accept Ahmadiyah blood, with one woman telling me, \u201cWe try to donate blood and we are refused, they say we don\u2019t want Ahmadiyah blood. Only if it\u2019s an emergency, then they come here and ask us.\u201d This sweeping ostracization of the Ahmadiyah is more insidious than the brutal violence of the Cikeusik attack, and just as dangerous. Islamists have been emboldened by the success in repressing the Ahmadiyah and are also turning their attention to other minority groups, like the Shia, Bahai and Christians. A 2006 decree that requires religious groups to get permission from a significant number of community members before building a house of worship has been used to shut down not only around 30 Ahmadiyah mosques, but more than 500 Christian churches and several Buddhist temples as well. Why should Australians care? A neighbouring country that fails to act decisively in the face of religious violence and facilitates intolerance of other faiths in violation of Indonesia\u2019s own Constitution risks destabilising the region. While Indonesia has done reasonably well in curbing terrorism, its enabling attitude towards intolerant Islamists may create threats which might spill over Indonesia\u2019s borders. Australia does not want to see Indonesia follow the path of Pakistan, where a failure of accountability for violence against religious minorities has led to steady increases in violence against Ahmadiyah, Shia, and Christians.\" To curb this trend of intolerance, the Indonesian government needs to act decisively. It can start by revoking discriminatory decrees as well as thoroughly investigating and punishing acts of religious violence. So far, president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has claimed he has \u201cno tolerance\u201d for religious violence , yet has he repeatedly failed to back up that promise with action. Australia and other key governments have leverage and should keep the pressure on Yudhoyono to address religious violence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
