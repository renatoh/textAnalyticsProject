However, last week's Ivor Novello Awards for songwriting portrayed the business in a more positive light by bringing the efforts of music publishers to the fore. The Ivors also add a rare sprinkle of stardust to what is generally held to be the unglamorous side of the industry, with KT Tunstall and Damon Albarn among the artists turning up in person to accept their gongs. More importantly, publishing music has been a more dependable business than recording it in recent times. Record sales Record companies acquire the rights to artists' recordings and sell them as singles or in albums, whereas music publishers buy the rights to the compositions themselves and earn money every time a song is bought in a shop, played at a gig or broadcast on radio. The former have watched their bottom lines take a pounding as record sales slipped from the year 2000 onwards, but music publishers have enjoyed steady cash flows as demand for music from advertisers, film-makers and even retailers has sheltered them from the ravages of digital piracy. According to Roger Faxon, the co-chief executive of EMI Music Publishing, the world's largest such company, publishers have benefited from a surge in demand for music over the past five years, despite the travails of record companies. EMI said last week that music publishing profits rose 6% to \u00a3105m, accounting for more than 40% of total group profits - on only 20% of the revenues. \"Everything else has expanded, from the use of music on TV, to adverts and radio broadcasters,\" says Faxon. \"Five years ago you could walk into a store and not hear music. Today there are few retail establishments that don't have music. So when something like that happens, we participate in it. There is an underlying cultural reason why publishing has been able to withstand the pressure of what is happening to the record industry.\" Faxon believes mobile devices will be the next big growth area for publishers. The industry gets its money from three sources: mechanical revenues, which come from record sales; performance sales, triggered when a song is played at a gig or broadcast on radio and TV; and synchronised turnover, which is derived from a tune's use on adverts, film soundtracks and mobile ring tones. Crazy Frog gives music-by-mobile a bad name, but polyphonic ring tones, download-friendly phones and TV-compatible handsets offer earning opportunities for publishers, says Faxon, who adds that all three revenue sources will be involved. \"I believe that mobile uses of music will be the most dynamic part of our business and that will take all three parts. Each of the rights is implicated,\" he says. However, the arrival of legitimate download services and the increasing sophistication of mobile phones have had painful implications for music publishers. Inevitably, it has brought former bedfellows into bitter disputes with each other. The biggest fissure in British music publishing has opened up between the record labels and the organisations that collect royalties on behalf of publishers and songwriters. The collecting societies, who have joined together to form the Music Alliance (MA), are demanding an increase in royalties from digital downloads. Record labels, represented by the British Phonographic Industry, have been accused of trying to halve digital royalties from 5p per download to 2.5p. Sat in between the warring camps is EMI Music Publishing, which awaits the outcome of a tribunal hearing on the issue in the autumn. Faxon toes a diplomatic line when discussing the dispute. Although his business represents songwriters and composers, it is also the sister company of EMI Music, the world's third largest record group. Reconciling a mandate that protects the interests of songwriters, who want a better deal on digital sales, with the concerns of a record group that needs to maximise download revenue to offset dwindling CD sales, is a tricky task. \"Our business is based on championing the rights of songwriters but that does not mean that the highest rates and most restrictive regimes are the right things for songwriters,\" he says. In other words, an increased digital royalty rate for songwriters could shunt up prices as all parts of the value chain - from the record labels to the download services - increase prices to cover their profit margins. \"If every piece of the [music] offering is asking for too much money then the price will have to go up and potentially the number of sales will go down. And that's not in anybody's interests.\" Adam Singer, chief executive of the MA, has toned down his fighting talk and speaks of the need for \"harmony\" and \"balance\". Few expect the dispute to go all the way to a tribunal, but there will be more birthing pains and the European Commission, ever eager to hunt down monopolies in its midst, is examining the way collecting societies operate. The industry is also heading for more structural change this year. The world's third largest music publisher, Bertelsmann's BMG Music Publishing, was put up for sale last week, with Universal Music Group and private equity firms expected to express strong interest in making bids. Buyout specialists will be attracted to the cash flows and their interest might be piqued by the widely held opinion in the investment community that music businesses can be run better, with room to make the likes of BMG and EMI Music Publishing even more profitable. Safer haven Patrick Yau, analyst at Bridgewell Securities, says music publishing can be seen as a safer haven for investors seeking exposure to the record industry, particularly if operational improvements are made. The key to success in music publishing, as in recorded music, is the A&amp;R executives who track down, sign up and nurture talent, he adds. \"In order to maintain its longevity as a banker the A&amp;R activity is key. As long as you are on top of predicting trends in music and finding artists, it's a good business to be in. The margins are high, around 25% compared with between 5% and 10% in recorded music, and the cash flows are strong.\" Faxon takes full control of EMI Music Publishing next year, when the legendary Martin Bandier steps down as co-chief executive. While he sings the praises of his colleague, Faxon says there will be changes - \"we look at what we do and we know we can do it better\" - as music publishers chase ever more outlets. \"We are placing songs in adverts, creating promotions around them online, putting them on radio stations, exposing them to video games. A wide variety of opportunities are out there.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
