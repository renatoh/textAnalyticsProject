The decision by the Conservative group on Lincolnshire county council ignored an appeal by the opposition Labour leader earlier this week for the ruling party to relinquish control until the local May elections and form a rainbow coalition. But today's special meeting of the council voted along party lines and Conservative councillor Barry Singleton was elected as its new leader. He then appointed a nine-strong cabinet made up entirely of Conservative members. The election comes a week after the resignation of the Conservative former council leader Ian Croft and his entire cabinet after a damning report by the Audit Commission. The report ruled that the council's leadership was weak and \"in denial\" about the impact of recent events on it's image. The council, said the report, had failed to behave \"in the way required in a modern local authority\". The Audit Commission recommended that an improvement board, made up of government, council and its own representatives, should be set up to make necessary improvements. After the vote today the council announced that the veteran former chief executive of Gateshead council Les Elton had been appointed by the office of the deputy prime minister to chair the improvement board."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
