Traditionally this was the time of year when British television itself took a break and left those of us stuck at home with a schedule of leftovers and repeats. Multichannel television changed all that and the competition for viewers is now hot all year round. That means broadcasters are spending more than ever to hold audience share in the summer months. Look at the big hitters in the schedules; Big Brother and Wife Swap on Channel 4, Restoration and the first-run drama The Long Firm on BBC2 and three first-run 9 o'clock dramas apiece on BBC1 and ITV. So who is winning? Channel 4 has the most striking year-on-year improvement and BBC1 has recovered from a poor first half of the year. Waking the Dead is dominating Sundays and Mondays and Casualty, for the first time running right through the summer, maintains the corporation's Saturday lead. It's ITV which is having to work hardest to catch up; it's had a tough time since Euro 2004. Did I say three first-run dramas on ITV? As of last Wednesday that's down to two after naval drama Making Waves was axed after three episodes. We've been here before - there was a major mid-run cull of ITV series last autumn when gangster drama Family and medical soap Sweet Medicine were both dramatically dropped or rescheduled. Axing a drama in mid-run in the summer indicates just how competitive life has got in British broadcasting. A look at the viewing figures would seem to suggest that something needed to be done. Its first episode attracted a respectable but not spectacular audience of 5.5 million viewers. The following week that had dropped to 4.1 million and by the third week it was down to 3.7 million, capturing only an 18% share of viewing (13% in the commercially vital London market). By contrast, last Wednesday's unbilled substitute programme It Shouldn't Happen on a TV Soap pulled the slot back above five million. So what went wrong? Was it the slot, the time of year or the programme itself? It would be hard to blame the slot. Wednesday at 9pm on ITV has a strong lead in from The Bill and is BBC1's weakest performing night - all those headlines proclaiming BBC1's lowest audience ever were all for Wednesday night shows. Summer is a tough time for our two mass-market channels to launch new series simply because there are about 20% fewer people watching TV, and both of ITV's other new dramas, Rose and Maloney and Island at War, have performed below expectations. That might explain the rather modest performance of episode one, but it doesn't hold water when you consider the drop in the audience of almost a third by episode three. So maybe Making Waves simply wasn't good enough? The story of its long gestation before coming to the screen perhaps gives some clues to its final fate. It was commissioned towards the end of my watch at ITV in 2002 and it had an impeccable pedigree. Ted Childs, who produced some of ITV's biggest and most enduring hits such as Peak Practice and Inspector Morse, was the man behind it. In Making Waves he was looking to do with the Navy what he'd done in the previous decade with the Army in Soldier, Soldier - a massive hit for ITV. It should have been an easy commissioning decision but in fact when it was first pitched to us some years earlier both Nick Elliott - ITV drama controller - and I had our doubts. The show had an old-fashioned feel to it that was out of sync with the new generation of ITV drama such as At Home with the Braithwaites and Bad Girls. So we passed. Ted and Carlton were persistent and kept developing the project and we at the Network kept prevaricating, not totally convinced ourselves that this kind of piece didn't still have a place in the ITV schedule. But we stuck to our guns. Finally our resolve was tested to destruction when BBC1 expressed interest and we had to face up to the possibility of a Soldier, Soldier-scale hit playing against us. We went for it. Did we make the wrong decision? Obviously. But I suspect the real truth is that in the five or so years that it took to come to the screen, Making Waves' time had simply come and gone. The cost in wasted effort, talent and money is heavy when major dramas like this go down, but it's a price ITV believes it has no choice but to pay."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
