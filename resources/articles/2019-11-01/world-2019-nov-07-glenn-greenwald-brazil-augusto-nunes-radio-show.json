Greenwald and Augusto Nunes are prominent figures on opposite ends of the political spectrum, but Thursday\u2019s physical violence \u2013 which was being livestreamed \u2013 left Brazilians stunned. Greenwald has become a central figure in Brazilian politics after publishing a string of articles challenging the legitimacy of the country\u2019s largest-ever corruption investigation. His reporting \u2013 based on a trove of leaked mobile phone messages \u2013 has been particularly damaging for the government of Jair Bolsonaro, making Greenwald a hate figure for those on Brazil\u2019s far right, who have accused him of illegal hacking. The altercation came when the two men appeared on a program for the Jovem Pan radio station on Thursday. Nunes, a well-known columnist for Veja magazine, had previously suggested that a family judge should look into taking away Greenwald\u2019s adopted children. Referring to Nunes\u2019s comments, Greenwald said: \u201cWhat he did was the ugliest, dirtiest thing I have seen in my career as a journalist.\u201d Nunes responded that he was merely asking who took care of Greenwald\u2019s children while his husband \u2013 the congressman David Miranda \u2013 was in the capital and the journalist was \u201cspending all his time dealing with stolen material\u201d. Greenwald accused Nunes of being a coward, prompting Nunes to take a swing at Greenwald. The two started lashing out at each other before they were pulled apart by station staff. In Brazil\u2019s current hyper-partisan atmosphere, reaction was divided predictably along political lines. Ciro Gomes, a leftwing politician who ran for president in 2018, called Nunes \u201cvermin\u201d and a \u201clowlife\u201d. Nunes was \u201cdestroying values, committing slander, aggression, throwing insults and defending the worst values of the corrupt right wing\u201d, he said in a video posted to social media. Two of Bolsonaro\u2019s son\u2019s expressed support for Nunes. Eduardo Bolsonaro, a congressman, tweeted that Nunes had acted \u201cin legitimate defense of his honor\u201d. \u201cNo one is required to be violated constantly with distortions of their words, be insulted to their face and accept it. Augusto Nunes didn\u2019t have another option. He reacted the way any normal person with blood in their veins would have done,\u201d Bolsonaro tweeted. Greenwald later posted a video to social media saying that Nunes\u2019s attack was homophobic and dangerous. \u201cMillions of Brazilians, and people all over the world \u2026 also have children and both parents work because of financial necessity or because they want to, but \u2026 he only says this about us,\u201d he said. \u201cThis use of physical force and violence in the political debate is very serious. Now we are seeing \u2026 that Bolsonaro\u2019s movement \u2026 is applauding, supporting his use of physical violence in the political debate.\u201d Greenwald won a Pulitzer prize for leading the Guardian\u2019s reporting on National Security Agency (NSA) spying revealed by Edward Snowden before co-founding the Intercept website in 2014."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
