Painfully chronicling the lives of three brothers over the course of a year or so as they amass scars they will carry into adulthood, this film is filled with golden sunsets that give scenes the fairytale quality of childhood memories. It is a thing of beauty: too beautiful perhaps, running a real danger of prettifying poverty. The setting is the mostly white world of upstate New York, all rusted trailers and junked cars on front lawns. The film\u2019s narrator is sensitive, observant 10-year-old Jonah (first time actor Evan Rosado is astoundingly good). He\u2019s the youngest of a trio of semi-feral brothers, who sleep like a little wolf pack in one bed, arms slung over each other. The camera hurtles to keep pace as they sniff out mischief. The boys are well loved but not loved well by parents who had kids too young. The family are blow-ins, originally from Brooklyn: dad Paps (Ra\u00fal Castillo) is Puerto Rican. Every once in a while he\u2019ll boil over, beating Ma (Sheila Vand) and taking off. Adapting Justin Torres\u2019s acclaimed novel, Zagar pulls us into a child\u2019s view of life. One day, Paps gives Jonah a hard-knocks swimming lesson, taking him out to the middle of the river and letting go. Jonah sinks helplessly into the black water. Zagar then cuts to the family\u2019s silent miserable drive home, skipping the rescue \u2013 editing this defining moment of boyhood in the way it might be encoded in Jonah\u2019s memory. It\u2019s a vivid eloquent scene, and there are others. But a few, like the boys, hungry, ransacking the kitchen with glee, felt unreal, not quite honest, too lovely to look at.
