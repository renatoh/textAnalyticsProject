The five Bulgarian nurses and one Palestinian doctor were released last month and have maintained that their confessions were extracted through torture. \"Yes, they were tortured by electricity and they were threatened that their family members would be targeted. But a lot of what the Palestinian doctor has claimed are merely lies,\" Seif al-Islam Gadafy was quoted as saying in the interview, which was first broadcast on Wednesday. Libyan authorities refused to comment yesterday. Ashraf al-Hazouz, an Egyptian-born Palestinian, told Dutch television last month that Libyan authorities had drugged him, attached live electrodes to his feet and genitals and set dogs on him. He also said that they tied his arms and legs to a bar and spun him repeatedly, like a chicken on a rotisserie. Dr Hazouz and the nurses were accused in 1999 of deliberately infecting more than 400 Libyan children with HIV. Fifty of them have since died. The medical workers were sentenced to death based on their confessions, but were released into Bulgarian custody last month after the sentences were commuted to life imprisonment. They were immediately granted a presidential pardon in Bulgaria and freed, an act which infuriated the Libyan authorities. Dr Hazouz and two of the nurses said they were ready to testify in a Bulgarian investigation about their torture allegations."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
