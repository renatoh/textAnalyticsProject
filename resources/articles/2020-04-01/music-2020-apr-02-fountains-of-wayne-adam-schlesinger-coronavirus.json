There were people from alternative rock: Ted Leo, Dashboard Confessional. There were people from Hollywood and theatre: Tom Hanks, Fran Drescher. There were TV personalities (Kathy Griffin) and politicians (New Jersey\u2019s governor, Phil Murphy) and novelists (Stephen King). There was the superstar producer who summed it all up: \u201cAdam Schlesinger took pop music writing to its classiest and most untouchable place,\u201d said Jack Antonoff. \u201cAn honour to live at the same time he made his work.\u201d So many people, from so many different strands, because Schlesinger wasn\u2019t one thing; he was a musical omnivore. He was the Grammy-winning rock musician with Fountains of Wayne; he was the pop sophisticate of Ivy; he was the songwriter providing faux hits for movies about musicians (That Thing You Do!, for which he was nominated for an Oscar, Hugh Grant\u2019s 80s pop hit in Music and Lyrics); he was the writer who soundtracked a musical TV series (Crazy Ex-Girlfriend) and who wrote for Sesame Street. He even managed to pick up an Emmy for a song written for a different awards show \u2013 his musical pastiche It\u2019s Not Just for Gays Anymore, for the 2011 Tony Awards \u2013 and then do it again with another song for the same ceremony the following year. There was seemingly no style he could not master. He was, genuinely, one of the pop geniuses of the past quarter-century. Schlesinger\u2019s work was borne of a deep love of and respect for songcraft. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s just more satisfying when you follow the rules rather than just make a bunch of sounds,\u201d he told me in 2011. \u201cThe magic of just making noise in the studio goes away after a while. That\u2019s not to say I don\u2019t sometimes respond to music just for the sound of it. But writing something within those old song formats is just harder to do than making a bunch of noise.\u201d I fell in love to the sound of Fountains of Wayne. I got married in March 1997 and we honeymooned in the south. I picked up a cassette of the band\u2019s debut album on the first day, and we hammered it as we drove around the Carolinas and Georgia. These were songs perfectly tailored for driving around America, flush with love: choruses so big they seemed to turn a hard-top into a convertible; lyrics so wry each line held a new treasure. They became \u201cour band\u201d \u2013 we went to see Fountains of Wayne at festivals, in clubs, in theatres. We insisted to our friends that they needed to hear this band. When they finally had an actual hit, with Stacy\u2019s Mom in 2003, I was thrilled other people were paying attention. I loved Fountains of Wayne so much that when they disappointed me I took it personally: the gigs where Schlesinger and Chris Collingwood seemed slightly underwhelmed, like superstar football players forced to turn out in a midweek cup tie against a lower-division team. But the records never let me down. There were obvious antecedents for Fountains of Wayne \u2013 the chunky powerpop of Cheap Trick, the sharp observations of Squeeze \u2013 but, as time went on, the group\u2019s distinctive voice became more and more pronounced. The \u201chits\u201d, such as there were, tended to be the uptempo tracks with the slightly snarky lyrics, but, as I got older I came to love more the gentler, more heartfelt songs. I don\u2019t know who wrote what, because Collingwood sang everything and all the songs were credited to both, but I\u2019m not sure it really matters. Fountains of Wayne songs were Fountains of Wayne songs, and the voice I heard in the sad, empathetic numbers I came to love \u2013 Sick Day, Fire Island, Hey Julie, Hackensack, The Man in the Santa Suit \u2013 was clear and distinct. So I don\u2019t know if it was Collingwood or Schlesinger who wrote my favourite Fountains of Wayne song, the one I put on when news came through that he was seriously ill with coronavirus. It\u2019s a song about failed love whose chorus translates to these days, wholly accidentally: \u201cMaybe one day soon it will all come out / How you dream about each other sometimes / With the memory of how you once gave up / But you made it through the troubled times.\u201d I hope you make it through the troubled times. And I mourn Adam Schlesinger."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
