Here\u2019s a look at the days major news items: Trump refuses to commit to accepting election result as Biden enjoys poll lead. In an extraordinary interview with Fox News Sunday recorded at the White House on Friday, Trump said \u201cI\u2019m not losing, because those are fake polls\u201d and refused to say if he would accept the result if Biden won in November. Trump bids to stop billions in track-and-trace funds as virus cases spike. The president is seeking to block billions of dollars in funding for coronavirus testing and contact tracing efforts even as cases rise across the US, where around 70,000 people are testing positive each day. Portland protesters\u2019 outrage grows over federal officers\u2019 \u2018blatant abuse\u2019. Trump tweets \u2018we are trying to help Portland, not hurt it\u2019 but the presence of militarized federal agents has prompted shock and anger in the Oregon city. Honor John Lewis by passing voting rights bill, leading Democrat urges. House majority whip James Clyburn called on Sunday for both voting rights legislation and an infamous bridge in Alabama to be named after the late civil rights hero. Roger Stone uses racial slur on black radio host\u2019s show. The political operative whose 40-month prison sentence was commuted by Donald Trump, his longtime friend, used a racial slur on air while verbally sparring with a black Los Angeles-based radio host. Trump equates support for Confederate flag with Black Lives Matter. The president has equated the Black Lives Matter movement with displays of the Confederate flag, saying: \u201cI\u2019m not offended either by Black Lives Matter, that\u2019s freedom of speech. You know the whole thing with cancel culture \u2013 we can\u2019t cancel our whole history. We can\u2019t forget that the north and the south fought.\u201d Republican senators post pictures of Elijah Cummings in John Lewis tribute. Social media accounts for two Republican senators, Marco Rubio of Florida and Dan Sullivan of Alaska, mistakenly posted photos of the late congressman Elijah Cummings alongside comments meant to honor John Lewis. If you missed Donald Trump\u2019s combative interview with Fox News\u2019s Chris Wallace, my colleague Amanda Holpuch has you covered. The US president\u2019s first Sunday show appearance in more than a year was peppered with a series of extraordinary moments, including a claim not to care what the military has to say about renaming its bases and an argument about whether identifying an elephant was strong evidence of mental stability. \u201cNearly four years into his wild and unlikely presidency,\u201d Holpuch writes, \u201cDonald Trump managed to shock the world again.\u201d Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti conceded Sunday that his city relaxed Covid-19 restrictions too quickly and warned that the city was \u201con the brink\u201d of new shutdown orders following a week that saw Los Angeles county record both its highest number of daily new cases and new hospitalizations since the pandemic began. Speaking on CNN\u2019s State of the Union, Garcetti criticized the \u201clack of national leadership\u201d in engendering an atmosphere conducive to backsliding. \u201cI think a lot of things went wrong,\u201d Garcetti said. \u201cBut, here, where we have had fewer deaths than many of the big cities, and our rate of increase hasn\u2019t accelerated as much as others \u2013 we\u2019re kind of in the middle of the pack \u2013 we have seen no national leadership. We have had to stand up testing centers on our own. We have had to do so much that is outside of our lane because of the lack of national leadership. \u201cBut, also, I think that there are people who are just exhausted. They were sold a bill of goods. They said this was under control. They said this would be over soon. And I think, when leaders say that, people react and they do the wrong things. They stop distancing themselves. They stop washing their hands. They stop wearing masks.\u201d Garcetti did not dispute the main thrust of a Los Angeles Times editorial published on Wednesday that stated the state\u2019s rapid reopening \u201cwasn\u2019t a good idea, especially because it suggested to a public desperate for release that the coronavirus was in retreat\u201d. \u201cI do agree that those things happened too quickly,\u201d Garcetti said. \u201cBut ... It\u2019s not just what\u2019s open and closed. It\u2019s also about what we do individually. It\u2019s about the people who are getting together outside of their households with people they might know. It might be their extended family. It might be friends. They might think, because they got a test two weeks ago, that it\u2019s OK. But it\u2019s not. This virus preys on our division. It preys when we get exhausted. It preys on us in those moments when we don\u2019t have a unified national front or we as individuals think, \u2018Oh, this ain\u2019t going to be a big deal.\u2019 We have to be as vigilant right now as we were the first day, bring 100% of our strength, the way we did the first or second month. I kind of feel like people are 20% or 30% of their strength these days. \u201cBut we are seeing some hopeful signs. And then you have to be patient. You have to be patient when you close things down again, as we have done, wait two or three weeks to see the effect. And you have to be patient when you reopen things, and don\u2019t have this domino effect of, hey, last week, it was the restaurants. Next week, it can be the bars. Week after that, everything\u2019s open. That is a failed way to go forward. Listen to the science. Track the data, and be smart.\u201d Louisiana officials said on Sunday they have temporarily suspended an emergency rent assistance program to help those hurt economically by the coronavirus pandemic because they were deluged with applicants. The Louisiana Housing Corporation (LHC) said more than 40,000 renters have expressed interest in the Louisiana Emergency Rental Assistance Program in the less than four days since the program was launched during a press conference on Thursday, with both the LaRentHelp.com website and 2-1-1 phone line getting overwhelmed. \u201cThe response to our state\u2019s emergency rental assistance program proves how significant the economic burden of Covid-19 is for our citizens,\u201d Louisiana\u2019s Democratic governor, John Bel Edwards, said on Sunday. \u201cThis program was designed to help mitigate and off-set evictions and homelessness, and while we have allocated an additional $17 million for a total of $24 million in federal assistance, we know that much more is needed to address this serious crisis for the hard-working men and women who continue to keep our state going during this crisis.\u201d The LHC, which had estimated it had enough money to assist roughly 10,000 at-risk tenants, said it will try to find more funds to help applicants in addition to the $24m in federal money originally allotted. Housing advocates had previously warned more relief would be needed with the $600-per-week federal unemployment payments due to expire at the end of the month. \u201cWe know there are many individuals and families whose lives have been upended by this pandemic and that there is a great sense of urgency for housing assistance,\u201d LHC executive director E Keith Cunningham Jr said. \u201cAs the state\u2019s housing agency, we are committed to doing everything we can to meet the needs of renters and landlords and are hopeful that additional federal dollars will become available as soon as possible.\u201d A number of NFL players took to social media on Sunday to publicly express their concerns and anger over the lack of agreed-upon coronavirus safety protocols with teams preparing to open training camps this week. America\u2019s most popular sports league has moved full speed ahead with plans to start the season on schedule in early September, All 32 teams having conducted their offseason programs remotely under the assumption that training camps will be held in person starting no later than 28 July. But some of the league\u2019s biggest stars expressed alarm on Sunday that too many outstanding issues remain before players can report in good conscience. \u201cWe need Football! We need sports! We need hope!\u201d New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees wrote on Twitter. \u201cThe NFL\u2019s unwillingness to follow the recommendations of their own medical experts will prevent that. If the NFL doesn\u2019t do their part to keep players healthy there is no football in 2020. It\u2019s that simple. Get it done @NFL.\u201d Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson said he is concerned because his wife, Ciara, is pregnant. He wrote: \u201cMy wife is pregnant. @NFL Training camp is about to start.. And there\u2019s still No Clear Plan on Player Health &amp; Family Safety. ???? We want to play football but we also want to protect our loved ones. #WeWantToPlay.\u201d The Houston Texans\u2019 JJ Watt, a three-time NFL defensive player of the year, highlighted a list of issues that need to be resolved before camps open on Tuesday, including information about how often players will be tested and what will happen if someone does test positive for the coronavirus. Watt noted that an opt-out clause \u201cfor those at higher risk or those with family members at higher risk\u201d had still not been agreed upon. The NFL is America\u2019s richest sports league with an estimated $15bn in revenue last year, but Dr Anthony Fauci, the US\u2019s top infectious disease expert, has described the sport as a \u201cperfect setup\u201d for spreading Covid-19 due to the full-contact nature of the sport on every play. It came as little surprise when Donald Trump lost New York state by 22 points in the 2016 presidential election, a landslide powered by Hillary Clinton\u2019s overwhelming 60.9% margin of victory in the massively populated five boroughs of New York City. And while polling shows the US president trailing Joe Biden by an even wider margin ahead of November\u2019s election, Trump\u2019s supporters in his home state made themselves heard on Sunday by taking to the water for the TrumpStock boat parade, which started with a flotilla near the Statue of Liberty before heading up the Hudson River toward the George Washington Bridge. Footage posted to social media showed vessels and jetskis carrying Trump 2020 flags as they cruised up the Hudson from New York Harbor amid clear skies and 93F temperatures. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has issued a statement in response to Donald Trump\u2019s pre-recorded interview with Fox News\u2019s Chris Wallace that aired on Sunday morning, describing the US president\u2019s coronavirus response as \u201cactively undercutting our ability to save lives and stop Covid-19\u201d: Yet again this morning, President Trump attacked the CDC and the public health experts who should be guiding our response to Covid-19, saying that they \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d what they\u2019re talking about. The past six months have proven again and again that it\u2019s Donald Trump who doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about when it comes to Covid-19. He said the virus would disappear. He said anyone who wants a test could get a test. He said the virus was under control. When it comes to the coronavirus, you can\u2019t believe a word he says. It\u2019s astonishing that even after 140,000 Americans have died in the worst Covid-19 outbreak in the developed world, President Trump continues his offensive against the CDC and scientists like Dr Fauci, instead of heeding their clear advice about the steps we must take to stop this virus \u2013 from ramping up testing to getting protective equipment to the heroes on the front lines. But what\u2019s truly disturbing is that President Trump isn\u2019t just attacking our leading health experts \u2013 he\u2019s waving the white flag and actively undercutting our ability to save lives and stop Covid-19 by shamefully trying to block critical additional new funding for the CDC, as well as for testing and tracing. Think about that again: In the middle of a pandemic that continues to worsen on his watch, President Trump is trying to keep money away from the public health measures that we know will keep us and our families safe. He even went on to attack the value of testing again in the same interview, perpetuating a terrible months-long streak. Mr President, your ignorance isn\u2019t a virtue or a sign of your strength \u2013 it\u2019s undercutting our response to this unprecedented crisis at every turn and it\u2019s costing Americans their jobs and their lives. It\u2019s long past due for President Trump to listen to somebody other than himself in how to fight this virus, because after six straight months of deadly mismanagement it is spiraling even more out of control. He can start immediately by adopting the proposals I have laid out for months now that experts tell us will help us stop this virus, save lives, and safely re-open our economy. Donald Trump is back at the White House after this morning\u2019s visit to Trump National Golf Club across the Potomac, his ninth trip to his Loudoun county property in 29 days. A White House pool report describes what\u2019s become a regular scene outside the club during the president\u2019s twice-weekly visits over the past month. Outside the club entrance, about 15 or so protesters displayed mostly handmade anti-Trump signs like \u201cThe World Despises You,\u201d \u201cHave a Nice Convention,\u201d \u201cTrump the Body Snatcher. What Country Is This?\u201d \u201cNo Trump. No KKK. No Racist Fascist USA,\u201d \u201cTrump Is The Virus,\u201d \u201cTrump Is Corrupt,\u201d \u201cGrifter and Failure,\u201d and one that said \u201cPIG\u201d with the \u201cI\u201d in the shape of a female stick figure. About five or so POTUS supporters waved pro-Trump flags (versions of \u201cTrump 2020: Keep America Great\u201d), planted a \u201cTrump-Pence\u201d sign in the grass or held up a handwritten \u201cJobs Not Mobs\u201d sign. A Jeep flying a blue \u201cTrump: Make America Great Again\u201d flag and a US flag drove back and forth repeatedly with patriotic songs playing on the radio. Other drivers honked as they passed by, although it was not always clear which camp they were cheering on. Trump fired off a couple of tweets on his ride back to the White House, taking a shot at \u201cRadical Left Democrats\u201d as the motorcade neared the Beltway and popping off at Obama and Biden once again on the final approach to the executive mansion, according to the pool report. Georgia Democrats will gather on Monday to decide a replacement for John Lewis, the great civil rights leader who died on Friday aged 80, after serving more than 30 years in Congress. Lewis\u2019s Atlanta-area seat will remain empty until Governor Brian Kemp schedules a special election but the Democratic party of Georgia is accepting applications for the nomination online until 6.30pm on Sunday. A special seven-member committee \u2013 including Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, 2018 gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams and 2014 gubernatorial nominee Jason Carter \u2013 will then choose between three and five candidates. The state party\u2019s executive committee will then choose a nominee and submit the name to the Georgia secretary of state by 4pm on Monday. In November, the nominee will face Republican Angela Stanton-King. Stanton-King is a reality TV personality who was pardoned earlier this year by Donald Trump for her role in a stolen car ring, for which she served six months of home confinement in 2007. Lewis won more than 84% of the vote when he last faced a Republican, in 2016. Bottoms, the Atlanta mayor and like Abrams a possible vice-presidential pick for Joe Biden, paid tribute to Lewis on Sunday. On CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, she said: \u201cYou know, growing up in Atlanta, we have the great privilege of having these giants walk amongst us. So for me personally, John Lewis was more than this historical figure. He\u2019s a person you see in the grocery store, that you see a church, that you see out and about around town. \u201cAnd his legacy really speaks to so much about where we are with this movement and this moment in America. What he instilled in all of us was just courage and to do the right thing and treat people in a way that would then in turn have dignity and respect upon all of us. And so I am so grateful for his leadership and legacy. \u201cI don\u2019t think it happenstance that his last public appearance was on the Black Lives Matter Plaza [near the White House in Washington]. Because I think in his own way, he was leaving with us this reminder that the fight continues.\u201d To adapt the words of the great Bruce Robinson, writer of Withnail and I, Donald Trump has finished thwacking his orb about and is prepared to step back into society. Or if not quite that, this huge thatched head of state with his earlobes and golf ball is back at the White House from his course in Virginia and has been tweeting again. Here\u2019s the pool report, from Peter Baker of the New York Times: The motorcade arrived back at the White House at 1.16pm. The ride was uneventful. POTUS lobbed a Twitter shot at \u2018Radical Left Democrats\u2019 just as the Beast neared the Beltway and another at Obama and Biden as the vehicles approached the White House. Your pool briefly spotted POTUS in a white shirt and red baseball cap heading back into the building. The tweet aimed at Obama and Biden was Obamagate-themed, which is what it is, but the one about \u201cradical left Democrats\u201d was again aimed towards Portland, where federal agents acting alongside city police continue to confront and sometimes detain protesters against police brutality and structural racism. Here\u2019s what Portland mayor Ted Wheeler had to say to CNN\u2019s State of the Union this morning: The president has a complete misunderstanding of cause and effect. We have dozens, if not hundreds of federal troops descending upon our city. And \u2026 they are sharply escalating the situation. Their presence is actually leading to more violence and more vandalism. It\u2019s not helping the situation at all. They\u2019re not wanted here. We haven\u2019t asked them here. In fact, we want them to leave. The tactics that the Trump administration are using on the streets of Portland are abhorrent. People are \u2026 being denied probable cause and they\u2019re denied due process. They don\u2019t even know who\u2019s pulling them into the vans. The people aren\u2019t identifying themselves. And, as far as I can see, this is completely unconstitutional.\u201d Here\u2019s Hallie Golden\u2019s report, which includes interviews with three protesters who have been subject to the attentions of such federal officers, or seen them in action: A sliver of good news from Vermont. The state has now gone 30 days without reporting a Covid-19 death, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. A total of 56 people have died from the virus in the rural, northeastern state but none since 19 June. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer has told CNN that cutting funding for the Centers for Disease Control during the pandemic would be extremely foolish. \u201cThe administration is talking about \u2013 Republican McConnell is talking about cutting it \u2013 that would be cutting your nose to spite your face. We need the CDC to help us fight Covid,\u201d he said. \u201cTo not have the facts, to not have the science makes no sense at all.\u201d Schumer added that the Democrats would fight to keep funding for the CDC. \u201cWe are going to do everything we can to make sure that the CDC is fully funded in the stimulus package,\u201d he said. Schumer also said it was important to keep data about the pandemic public. \u201cFor the president, the administration to want to sweep the facts under the rug so they can hide them, it\u2019s not gonna work,\u201d he said. \u201cWhenever the President has tried to avoid the problem, like this will go away, this wont affect many people, it\u2019s gotten worse.\u201d Some have sought to downplay the alarming rise in Covid-19 cases across the US by saying that it is mostly younger, healthier people who are contracting the virus. Apart from the fact that young people can spread the virus to more vulnerable populations, there are also plenty of examples of healthy people suffering devastating effect from Covid-19. And they don\u2019t get much healthier than professional athletes. Atlanta Braves first baseman Freddie Freeman, one of the best players in baseball, said he prayed for his life after contracting the virus. \u201cI said a little prayer that night,\u201d Freeman said, describing how his temperature rose to 104.5F (40.2C) at one point. \u201cI\u2019ve never been that hot before. My body was really, really hot. ... I said \u2018Please don\u2019t take me\u2019 because I wasn\u2019t ready.\u201d The 30-year-old Freeman has since recovered but says he does not know if he will be ready for the start of the MLB season, which is due to get underway on Thursday. Colorado\u2019s Democratic governor, Jared Polis, has called national testing for Covid-19 \u201ca disgrace\u201d during an appearance on NBC\u2019s Meet The Press. \u201cSo, the national testing scene is a complete disgrace,\u201d said Polis. \u201cSo, every test we send out to private lab partners nationally, Quest, Labcorp, seven days, eight days, nine days maybe six days if we\u2019re lucky. Almost useless from an epidemiological or even diagnostic perspective. Fortunately, our state lab has done yeoman\u2019s work. We\u2019re running three shifts a day there, 24 hours a day. \u201cSo while some are still sent out of state, and unfortunately that takes a long time and we can\u2019t count on it and our country needs to get testing right, we\u2019re trying to build that capacity in Colorado to process tests at that one to two-day turnaround, and we already are able to do two or three-thousand a day that way, and even more along with our private lab partners in-state like UC Health.\u201d The Florida Department of Health reported 12,478 new cases of Covid-19 on Sunday, a rise from the 10,328 cases reported on Saturday. In addition, 87 new deaths were reported, down from the 90 on Saturday. A total of 4,982 people have died from the virus in Florida since the start of the pandemic. In an appearance on ABC\u2019s This Week on Sunday, congresswoman Donna Shalala, who represents Florida\u2019s 27th congressional district, attacked the state and federal response to the pandemic. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have community spread, which means the virus is out of control. The lack of leadership in the White House and in our governor\u2019s office, they simply have not hit this with a hammer, which is what we needed to do, and starve the virus. They opened too soon. And they misunderstand what you need to do \u2013 or they understand it and they\u2019re not willing to do it. \u201cNext week, the Kaiser Family Foundation will report for the hotspot states that it\u2019s seniors again, in nursing homes, and young people now. In my district, it\u2019s low-income minorities, Hispanics and African Americans, who were forced to go back to work for economic reasons and because their employers demanded they go back to work. And they live in multigenerational situations, in small quarters, and the disease simply spread in those areas.\u201d There has been some confusion as to whether Kanye West\u2019s run for the presidency is serious. Earlier this week, he qualified to appear on the presidential ballot in Oklahoma while on Friday he asked his followers to plead with supporters to get him on the ballot in South Carolina, where he missed the deadline for registration. However, earlier in the week West\u2019s adviser said he \u201cis out\u201d of the running. On Sunday, a tweet appeared to show West still thinks the dream is alive. He posted a drawing of the White House with the caption \u201cTHE WEST WING\u201d. While many view West\u2019s run as a stunt, others worry he could take votes off the presumptive Democratic candidate Joe Biden in crucial battleground states if he does run. Ohio\u2019s Republican governor, Mike DeWine, has appeared on NBC\u2019s Meet The Press and said he is concerned about the direction Covid-19 is taking in his state. \u201cWe are at the point where we could become Florida, you know. Where you look at our numbers today versus where Florida was a month ago, we have very similar numbers. So we\u2019re very, very concerned,\u201d said DeWine. DeWine then avoids a question about whether he has confidence in Donald Trump\u2019s leadership during the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cI think people look frankly to the governors. Historically, we\u2019ve looked to governors to deal with, you know, crises, whether it\u2019s tornado damage, whether it\u2019s a flood, a pandemic,\u201d says DeWine. \u201cWe look to governors. And so, you know, what this administration has been able to provide us and that Congress has provided us, and we thank both of them, is the money.\u201d DeWine is asked again if he has confidence in the president\u2019s leadership, and he again largely avoids the question, instead mostly praising Mike Pence rather than Trump. \u201cI have confidence in this administration,\u201d says DeWine. \u201cWe\u2019re on a phone call every week, every governor, Democrats and Republicans, sometimes twice a week, with the vice president. The vice president has been doing an absolutely phenomenal job in leading that and, of course, the president has delegated that to the vice president.\u201d The New York Times reports that Roger Stone, the longtime friend and former campaign adviser for Donald Trump, has used a racial slur during an interview with a broadcaster who is black. The president commuted Stone\u2019s prison sentence earlier this month and Stone appeared on Morris W O\u2019Kelly\u2019s radio show to discuss the issue on Saturday. O\u2019Kelly referenced Stone\u2019s relationship with the president when he asked: \u201cThere are thousands of people treated unfairly daily, how your number just happened to come up in the lottery, I am guessing it was more than just luck, Roger, right?\u201d It then sounded like Stone, who was being interviewed over the phone, spoke to someone nearby stating: \u201carguing with this Negro\u201d. When challenged about his use of the word, Stone remained silent before denying he had used it. \u201cIt\u2019s the diet version of the N-word, but as an African-American man, it\u2019s something I deal with pretty frequently,\u201d O\u2019Kelly told the Times. \u201cIf there\u2019s a takeaway from the conversation, it is that Roger Stone gave an unvarnished look into what is in the heart of many Americans today.\u201d The number of patients in hospital in New York with Covid-19 is at its lowest since 18 March. There were 722 hospitalizations due to Covid reported on Sunday, down from 743 on Saturday. Thirteen deaths from the virus in New York were reported on Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to progress forward through the Covid-19 pandemic in the face of a continued explosion of cases throughout the United States, and that\u2019s reflected in today\u2019s hospitalizations \u2013 the lowest number since March 18 \u2013 and rate of positive cases,\u201d New York governor Andrew Cuomo said in a statement. Karen Bass, chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, is on ABC\u2019s This Week to talk about civil rights leader and congressman John Lewis, who died on Friday. \u201cWhat we have to do is live up to his legacy,\u201d says Bass. \u201cWe need to continue that fight for social justice. And again, the first thing we need to do is to pass the Voting Rights Act and get it signed, because we\u2019re very concerned about the election coming up and voter suppression, and the fact that people are going to have to vote in dangerous conditions. They need to be able to vote from home. \u201cAnd I know that if he was still with us, he would be leading that fight.\u201d Dr Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, has appeared on NBC\u2019s Meet The Press. He is asked whether he has been told to fire or demote Anthony Fauci by anyone in the White House. \u201cNobody has asked me to do that and I find that concept unimaginable,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I am amused that everybody\u2019s calling me Dr Fauci boss because his real boss is his wife, Christine Grady. She might have something to say about that.\u201d Collins also expresses confusion at the fact that mask wearing has turned into a political question. \u201cWell, it is bizarre that we have turned the mask wearing into something political,\u201d he says. \u201cImagine you were an alien coming to the planet Earth, and looking around, looking at the scientific data or going from various place to place and looking to see who\u2019s wearing masks. \u201cYou would be totally astounded, puzzled, amazed, you\u2019d wonder, \u2018What is going on here? How could it be that something as basic as a public health action, that we have very strong evidence can help, seems to attach to people\u2019s political party?\u2019\u201d The interview ends with Trump being asked how he will remember his years in the White House. He strikes a familiar, self-pitying tone. \u201cI think I was very unfairly treated,\u201d he says. \u201cFrom before I even won I was investigation by a bunch of thieves, crooks. It was an illegal investigation.\u201d Trump says he will win the election in November against an opponent who is \u201cmentally shot\u201d. Trump then continues his tactics of depicting Biden as a tool of the \u201cradical left\u201d. \u201cHe will destroy this country, but it won\u2019t be him, it will be the radical left \u2013 the same ideology that took over Venezuela\u2026 they now have no water or medicine ... the same will happen here.\u201d Disturbingly, he then refuses to say he will accept the result of the election. \u201cCan you give a direct answer you will accept the election?\u201d asks Wallace. \u201cI have to see ... I have to see. No, I\u2019m not going to just say yes,\u201d says the president. Trump says he is \u201cnot a big fan\u201d of Fox, and says the channel has changed since the death of its former CEO Roger Ailes. Attention turns to the recent book by the president\u2019s niece, Mary, that depicts Trump and his wider family as dysfunctional. \u201cShe was not exactly a family favorite,\u201d he says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a lot of respect or like for her. I would\u2019ve never said that except she writes a book that\u2019s so stupid and so vicious and it\u2019s a lie.\u201d He says he objected to criticism of his parents. \u201cIt hurts me more by attacking my father and not being kind to my mother,\u201d says Trump. You can read our review of Mary Trump\u2019s book here: Trump claims Democrats want to keep the economy closed down before the election so that it will reflect badly on him. Trump is asked why he replaced his campaign manager, Brad Parscale, if he is winning the election campaign. \u201cHe\u2019s a great digital guy, we all like him a lot, but I have somebody that was involved. You know they were all on the 2016 campaign,\u201d he says. Attention turns to November\u2019s election. Trump is shown a poll that shows people trust Joe Biden more to handle coronavirus, race relations, and the economy, and that Biden leads by eight points overall. He says such polls are \u201cfake\u201d. Trump\u2019s tactics this fall are likely to attempt to depict Biden as a radical socialist. But in Sunday\u2019s interview he appears to go after Biden\u2019s mental faculties. \u201cBiden can\u2019t put two sentences together. They wheel him out. He goes up \u2013 he repeats \u2013 they ask him questions,\u201d he says. \u201cHe reads a teleprompter and then he goes back into his basement.\u201d Trump is then asked if he thinks Biden is senile. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say that. I\u2019d say he\u2019s not competent to be president,\u201d he says. He is also asked about a poll that says people think Biden is more mentally sound than Trump. \u201cLet him take the same test that I took.\u201d I\u2019ll guarantee you that Joe Biden could not answer those questions.\u201d Trump is asked about renaming military bases that are named after Confederate figures. \u201cGo to the community, say how do you like the idea of renaming Fort Bragg, and then what are we going to name it? We going to name it after the Reverend Al Sharpton?\u201d he says. Trump is asked if the Confederate flag is racist. \u201cWhen people proudly have their Confederate flags, they\u2019re not talking about racism. They love their flag, it represents the south,\u201d says Trump. He then equates Black Lives Matters flags with Confederate flags, a staggering and offensive claim given that the latter represents a system that thrived on slavery. Next up is crime in America. Trump has long depicted himself as a law and order president, even if that doesn\u2019t always extend to clamping down on his friends\u2019 activities. He is asked about rising crime in US cities in recent weeks. \u201cI explain it very simply by saying they\u2019re Democrat-run cities. They\u2019re liberally run. They\u2019re stupidly run.\u201d He then makes a false claim about Biden, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s really because they want to defund the police, and Biden wants to defund the police.\u201d \u201cNo, sir, he does not,\u201d Wallace says. In fact, Biden has repeatedly said he does not support calls to defund the police and has instead called for policing reform. Trump says he would consider not signing another economic stimulus package if there is no payroll tax cut. Trump says he wants states to reopen schools where possible. \u201cThere is going to be a funding problem because we aren\u2019t going to fund them if they don\u2019t open their schools.\u201d Trump is asked about enforcing a nationwide mandate for masks to be worn in public. \u201cNo, I want people to have a certain freedom,\u201d says Trump. He later says he believes masks can help stop the spread of Covid-19 though. Trump is asked about his top infectious diseases expert, Dr Anthony Fauci. Reports indicate the White House is looking to discredit Fauci. Trump denies he has fallen out with Fauci, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. \u201cI spoke to him yesterday at length, I have a very good relationship with Dr. Fauci\u201d he says. He also says Fauci, who has emerged as a frank public voice on the pandemic, is \u201ca little bit of an alarmist\u201d Trump adds that he believes Covid-19 will \u201ceventually disappear\u201d. Trump says the surge in Covid-19 cases is down to an increase in testing. Wallace points out that testing is up but that does not account for the overall increase in positive tests, as well as the increase in positivity. Trump then reverts to blaming China, an old tactic. He says rates are lower in Europe because testing is not as widespread there. Trump is now on Fox News being interviewed by Chris Wallace. First up is the coronavirus. Trump is asked about the surge in cases of coronavirus. Trump says the US has one of the lowest mortality rates in the world, which is untrue. He is then shown a chart that shows the US has the seventh worst rate in the world. Fox News\u2019 interview with Donald Trump will broadcast in the next 10 minutes. The interview, with Chris Wallace, was conducted on Friday and by all accounts was a little spicy. The Guardian spoke to Wallace earlier this year about his views on Trump and his relationship with a broadcaster that some believe shapes his policy: Portland, Oregon remains the site of anti-racism and anti-police brutality protests and confrontations with police and federal officers sent to the north-western city by the Trump administration. Hallie Golden has been speaking to some of the protesters: Lindsey Smith, 26, a preschool teacher who has been attending protests regularly, said she started noticing federal officers firing tear gas into the crowd and detaining and arresting people at the beginning of July. On three recent occasions, she said, she witnessed people bang on the boarded-up doors of the federal courthouse in downtown Portland. Officers opened a door, grabbed the person and pulled them into the building, before slamming it shut again. But she said it was important not to let such officers\u2019 actions overshadow the fact that the Portland Police Bureau (PPB) has been \u201cextremely violent\u201d to local protesters for much longer. \u201cThis has been going on for months with PPB enacting the same kind of violence that we\u2019re seeing from the feds now,\u201d she said. Hallie\u2019s full report will be live soon. In the meantime, Donald Trump has tweeted on the matter, claiming: \u201cWe are trying to help Portland, not hurt it. Their leadership has, for months, lost control of the anarchists and agitators. They are missing in action. We must protect Federal property, AND OUR PEOPLE. These were not merely protesters, these are the real deal!\u201d Here\u2019s Trevor Timm\u2019s powerful take on what is going on: Remarkable as it may seem, the Texas Republican party has been fighting to be allowed to stage its convention with large, in-person indoor events, even as coronavirus cases surge in the state and Houston, the intended venue, emerges as a hotspot, hospitals creaking under the strain. On Saturday, a federal appeals court overruled a judge\u2019s Friday decision allowing the in-person convention to go ahead in the fourth-largest US city. Judge Lynn Hughes, of the southern district of Texas, had ruled that the city of Houston violated the GOP\u2019s constitutional rights by canceling the event. Mayor Sylvester Turner, a Democrat, appealed that ruling. The ruling against Judge Hughes came as Texas reported more than 10,000 new cases of Covid-19 for a fifth consecutive day and more than 100 deaths for a fourth day in a row. The total number of Texans hospitalised rose to 10,658. The seven-day average for positive tests was just over 16%. James Dickey, chairman of the Texas Republican party, has said the party will try a virtual gathering. On Saturday, it took Donald Trump 14 hours to tweet a tribute to John Lewis, the Democratic congressman and civil rights leader who died aged 80 on Friday night. When the presidential tweet did come \u2013 after the president had played golf \u2013 it was short and to the point. \u201cSaddened to hear the news of civil rights hero John Lewis passing,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cMelania and I send our prayers to he and his family.\u201d Today, meanwhile, flags at the White House which were ordered lowered to half-staff in Lewis\u2019s memories have reportedly been raised to their full height again. But at least Trump hasn\u2019t sent out a tweet or posted to Facebook pictures of Lewis which are in fact pictures of somebody else. It\u2019s a trap into which two Republican senators fell, as the Associated Press reports: Social media accounts for two Republican senators, Marco Rubio of Florida and Dan Sullivan of Alaska, mistakenly posted photos of the late congressman Elijah Cummings alongside comments meant to honor John Lewis. The posts were quickly revised with photos of Lewis, the civil rights leader and lawmaker who died on Friday at the age of 80. Rubio acknowledged the error and displayed a video of himself with Lewis. \u201cEarlier today I tweeted an incorrect photo,\u201d he wrote. \u201cJohn Lewis was a genuine American hero. I was honored to appear together in Miami three years ago at an event captured in video below. May God grant him eternal rest.\u201d Sullivan\u2019s Facebook tribute to Lewis featured a photo of Sullivan and Cummings, a congressman from Maryland who died last year, at the opening of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. The revised tribute omitted reference to the museum, and the photo was replaced with a picture of Lewis alone. The changes were made without comment. In response to an email, Sullivan spokesman Mike Anderson wrote: \u201cSenator Sullivan\u2019s staff made a mistake trying to honor an American legend.\u201d Lewis represented an Atlanta district from 1987 until his death. Cummings, a fellow civil rights activist who won 12 terms in Congress representing a district in Maryland, died last October, aged 68. For what it\u2019s worth, Trump seems to be heading out to play golf. Pool reporter Peter Baker, of the New York Times, says reporters were \u201cloaded into the motorcade for an excursion to an undisclosed location but your guess is probably right. For what it\u2019s worth, the temperature in Sterling, Virginia, is set to climb to a muggy 98F today.\u201d He adds: \u201cThe motorcade is rolling as of 8.12am. A man in a golf shirt, shorts and cap was escorted into the motorcade moments before departure, presumably a guest. Will endeavor to identify him.\u201d Presumably that\u2019s an extra guest to Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina senator and former presidential candidate who famously called Trump a \u201cnutjob\u201d, \u201ca loser\u201d and a \u201crace-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot\u201d who would \u201cdestroy\u201d the Republican party, but has since become Trump\u2019s golfing partner and close ally on Capitol Hill. CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins reports that it \u201clooks like Graham is headed to the golf course with President Trump for the second day in a row. They were just spotted \u2026 leaving the White House together.\u201d Of course that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean Graham had a sleepover with his best friend, getting to stay up and watch The Baby-Sitters Club on Netflix and have cookies and milk and then sit talking till, like, forever \u2013 sorry, tired dad of three young girls writing here \u2013 but you have to agree it\u2019s an image. \u2026and welcome to another day of coverage of politics in the US, which means coverage of the presidential campaign, the coronavirus pandemic, tributes to the late John Lewis and more. Fox News Sunday will this morning broadcast an interview with Donald Trump, his first with a Sunday show in more than a year, which sees the president questioned by Chris Wallace, one of the more incisive interviewers in American television. A clip released on Friday showed Wallace putting Trump right on his claim Joe Biden wants to defund the police \u2013 which Biden doesn\u2019t \u2013 and Trump not liking it. The interview was recorded on Friday, however. Wallace said he did ask the president about the pandemic and efforts to tackle it. But they were speaking a day before the Washington Post and then the New York Times reported that as Congress and the Trump White House negotiate the next stimulus and relief package for an economy and a nation hammered by Covid-19, the White House is seeking to block funding for testing and tracing efforts, and other key areas of the pandemic response. As itemised by the Times, Senate Republicans \u2013 many from states experiencing frightening surges in cases and hospitalisations \u2013 have proposed: $25bn to states for conducting testing and contact tracing About $10bn for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) About $15bn for the National Institutes of Health $5.5bn to the state department and $20bn to the Pentagon \u201cto help counter the virus outbreak and potentially distribute a vaccine at home and abroad\u201d. But in talks over the weekend, administration officials instead pushed to zero out the funding for testing and for the nation\u2019s top health agencies, and to cut the Pentagon funding to $5bn. The suggestions infuriated several Republicans on Capitol Hill, who saw them as tone deaf. According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, the US has now seen more than 3.7 million cases of Covid-19 and more than 140,000 people have died, with around 70,000 new cases being confirmed every day. But Trump, remember, thinks the US should do fewer tests, because that means it will discover fewer cases. We\u2019ll be looking for reaction throughout the morning, as well as other news lines. In the meantime, here\u2019s essential reading from Tom McCarthy, our national affairs correspondent, on what the experts say is coming down the tracks in the fall:"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
