His shimmering cylinder of 5,600 hanging silicon rods is set to fill Camden's Roundhouse like a disco shower-curtain, creating a space for live performances as well as a walkthrough film screen for the work of major artists including Matt Collishaw, Christian Marclay, David Shrigley and Hussein Chalayan. Music comes courtesy of the likes of the London Contemporary Orchestra performing Vaughan Williams's Fantasia and Berlin-based electronic label Inversions. Silent classic The Cabinet Of Dr Caligari is also screening, while Jonathan Safran Foer, author of Everything Is Illuminated, will deliver a 'rude oracle'. Roundhouse, NW1, Tue to 29 Aug SS Mystics Or Rationalists, Edinburgh The title is lifted from Sol LeWitt: \"Conceptual artists are mystics rather than rationalists. They leap to conclusions that logic cannot reach.\" At a time when the term conceptual art is bandied about in reference to such transparently non-conceptualists as Tracey Emin, this show by nine contemporary artists reminds us of a creative genre that puts as much emphasis on often highly obscure ideas as on the apparent resolution of the finished image. But this exhibition gives a new slant to the term by including such ponderous art as the psychic questionings of Susan Hiller and Cornelia Parker's The Collected Death Of Images, a semi-reflective sheet of silver grey next-to-nothingness. Ingleby Gallery, to 29 Oct Robert Clark Rick Davies, Cardiff It's hard to believe that what Rick Davies shows us isn't the result of some fantastical cutting and pasting. In his Gursky-like panoramic photos of Wales' changing landscape, hi-tech plants stretch seemingly as far as the eye can see like a city of the future, though rows of cars parked up next to ploughed fields show this is present-day. The spires of ancient rural churches are echoed by factory edifices, while train tracks, metal pipes and monster mining operations seem to overshadow the mountains in the distance. Tellingly, though, both industry and countryside seem equally lonely and abandoned. Ffoto Gallery at The Dairy, Thu to 27 Aug SS Jean Genet, Nottingham A show dedicated to the memory of one of the most daring, provocative, wonderfully contrary and enduringly influential writers of the 20th century: the French rebel playwright and composer of autobiographical fictions Jean Genet. Staged in two \"Acts\", the exhibition focuses on distinctive stages of the Genet charisma: the early Genet \u2013 ex-con, army deserter and existentialist subversive \u2013 and the late, politicised, Genet who campaigned for the Black Panthers and the Palestinian fedayeen. Act One is a curated installation by artist Marc Camille Chaimowicz featuring a super-intense portrait by his friend Alberto Giacometti, a stunning complex of appropriately quivering painterly gestures. Act Two features, among other things, Mona Hatoum's sculptural set of ceramic grenades. Nottingham Contemporary, to 2 Oct RC We Colonised The Moon, London We Colonised The Moon are Sue Corke and Hagen Betzwieser, an artist duo whose work is sure to appeal to anyone with a passion for home science kits, or who marvels at space travel while feeling the rub of their own helpless existence. Past activities have included a scratch and sniff card with the scent of the moon (like gunpowder, according to astronaut Charlie Duke), as well as an absurdist circular solar-powered solarium. Their latest, 101 Harmless Scientific Experiments To Try At Home, is a six-week art laboratory with workshops and family days, with activities including auditions for astronauts, building time machines, and working out how to go anti-gravity. Acme Project Space, E2, Thu to 25 Sep SS Apichatpong Weerasethakul, Dublin The films of Apichatpong Weerasethakul are less movie stories than a series of evocative fragments. With an overall theme of nocturnal reverie, one often gets the impression of drifting in and out of sleep. Weerasethakul deliberately adopts supposedly bad technique \u2013 not unusual among video artists \u2013 but what is rare among practitioners of such a relatively young medium is his highly sophisticated and apparently fully assured compositional command. These are experimental works made by an artist sensitive and experienced enough to predict the wonderful surprise of the outcome. Irish Museum Of Modern Art, to 31 Oct RC James Capper, Oxford After three years of artists' projects in Oxford's Rosehill estate, Modern Art Oxford's parting kiss to the area comes with a sharp set of teeth \u2013 steel \"ripper teeth\", to be exact. Inspired by construction machinery and the earth-moving inventions of Robert Gilmour LeTournea, James Capper has designed his own metal jaws, which he'll be using to scour the ground with the aid of an excavator vehicle. Capper's teeth bite into pertinent issues like urban regeneration and what this might mean for locals, while an exhibition of drawings and blueprints illuminate his thinking back at the gallery's project space. Modern Art Oxford, to 22 Sep SS Memory Of A Hope, Liverpool An exhibition of over 100 paintings, photographs, sculptures, audio works and films on a theme of half-doomed optimism curated by sculptor Matthew Holding. He contributes A Reproduction Of One Of The Twelve Decorative Columns Located Within The Casino Of The Oceanic Hotel Designed by Walter May, 1956 (2011), a typical piece of meticulously constructed sculptural memorial to an implausibly idealistic architectural future. This is work playing knowingly on art's innate artifice and on each individual artist's wilfully composed self-creative conceits. Fittingly, Rita Sobrol Campos's photographic record of an old-time Olivetti typewriter text work, The Last Myth In The History Of Mankind, makes cryptic use of the writings of the early-20th century Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa, perhaps the most self-questioning multiple-personality, spirited melancholic and forward-looking nostalgic in the entire history of world literature.
