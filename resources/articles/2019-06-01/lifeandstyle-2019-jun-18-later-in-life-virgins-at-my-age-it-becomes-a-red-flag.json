He\u2019s empathetic and a good listener, he says \u2013 \u201cso a lot of people tell me about their personal shit\u201d, including the people he works with at his retail management job in the south-eastern US. But when they complain to him about their sex lives, or he sees happy couples hand-in-hand in the shop, \u201cI think: \u2018That\u2019s not something that\u2019s going to happen for me.\u2019\u201d At 31, Richard is a virgin. If it seems as though taboos about sex have lifted in these ostensibly open-minded times, there is one that holds steady: the stigma over never having had sex. While it has become widely unacceptable to criticise someone for having too many partners, being a virgin \u201cstill seems to be something that can be only mocked or shamed or suspect\u201d, says Richard. It may be that later-in-life virginity is dismissed as a problem with an easy fix. Cath Mercer, a principal investigator on the Natsal survey of sexual attitudes and lifestyles in Britain, says the vast majority (95%) of the general population report have made their \u201csexual debut\u201d \u2013 as she rather grandly puts it \u2013 by age 25. And the most recent data available, from 2010-12, suggests that just 2.2% of British men and 1.1% of women were virgins at the age of 30. Yet there are many reasons that a thirty or fortysomething might never have had sex, says Libby, a 37-year-old Canadian. \u201cIt could be tied to mental health issues, ranging from low self-esteem and social anxiety to serious depression. It could be due to a childhood of abuse, or physical health issues like cerebral palsy, or a religious upbringing, or even lack of comprehensive sex education.\u201d Libby connects her virginity to her personality traits (\u201ccynical, private, loud, opinionated and chubby \u2013 though my friends would say I\u2019m being too hard on myself\u201d) and her 10-year struggle with depression and anxiety. \u201cWhen I was sick, I could barely get out of bed, let alone put myself out there to potential partners.\u201d When she was well, she found that medication \u2013 for her mental health, and oral contraceptives to mitigate her very painful periods \u2013 wiped out her libido. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t have the drive, sex isn\u2019t something you pursue,\u201d says Libby. \u201cI don\u2019t blame drugs entirely \u2013 as I said, I never put much effort into dating and sex \u2013 but I do think they play a large part in my story.\u201d Richard also identifies poor mental health as a factor in his virginity. He is now on antidepressants and \u2013 following substance abuse in his 20s \u2013 sober. He guesses that his religious upbringing \u2013 where sex was not discussed beyond \u201cDon\u2019t do it\u201d \u2013 was also influential. But, maybe counterintuitively, he says the reason he has not had sex is that, to him, it\u2019s not just about sex. \u201cIf that was all I wanted to accomplish, I would\u2019ve just gone out and got it over with a long time ago.\u201d He has had \u201ca handful\u201d of chances to lose his virginity, but drunken opportunities at parties when he was younger \u201cjust didn\u2019t feel right\u201d, and his subsequent sobriety put an end to those. Dating apps are no solution \u2013 for him or many others. As Libby puts it: \u201cIf someone is still a virgin after 30, they likely have some issues tied to it, none of which will be solved with a swipe to the right and a random hookup.\u201d Although Richard describes himself as introverted and afraid of intimacy and rejection, he says the reason he struggles to approach strangers cold is \u201cnot because I\u2019m desperate \u2013 it\u2019s because I\u2019m not that desperate\u201d. He is articulate, even wryly humorous, about his virginity, even as he says it causes him day-to-day unhappiness. \u201cIt\u2019s like trying to date with an STD that\u2019s not contagious and easily curable, but still puts people off.\u201d Although he desires a relationship more than sex, he says that at a certain point his status can become self-perpetuating. \u201cAt my age, it becomes a red flag for people. I don\u2019t really have interpersonal romantic experience, not even just on a physical level, but on an emotional level, too.\u201d He rejects the stereotype that lack of sexual experience extends to life experience (in the style of Steve Carrell\u2019s naive 40-Year-Old Virgin). \u201cI\u2019ve been through a lot, even for a regular person.\u201d Nor is he a \u201cmopey neckbeard or, even worse, incel\u201d \u2013 the group of overwhelmingly misogynistic men who blame women for their poor sex lives. A few years ago, Richard went to see a sex therapist, but never returned. \u201cHe asked me \u2013 and this will always stick in my head \u2013 \u2018Why don\u2019t you just pay someone if you want to have sex?\u2019 \u201cI said: \u2018Well, I want someone to want me, I want to want them, I want us to want to do this.\u2019 He got really indignant. \u2018It\u2019s just sex \u2013 you need to get over yourself.\u2019\u201d The thing is, says Richard, \u201cyou don\u2019t know who\u2019s going to judge you for it or who won\u2019t. There\u2019s no way to tell.\u201d The therapist spent the rest of the hour practising a mindfulness technique, says Richard. \u201c\u2018Like, \u2018Tell me what you think of yourself with regards to relationships \u2013 what would you be without this thought?\u2019 I thought: \u2018I wouldn\u2019t be in your office right now, paying you $200.\u2019\u201d Three years ago Richard was pursued by a woman who retreated after learning, via a game of 20 questions over text, that he was a virgin. \u201cWhen I kind of pried, she said that she thought that she would \u2018ruin\u2019 me.\u201d That response is not uncommon, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re dictating your sexuality for you, in a way \u2013 what you are and aren\u2019t ready for, what you can handle emotionally, just based on that one titbit about you.\u201d Julia, from Los Angeles, also comes up against preconceptions. At 31 going on 32, she is an evangelical Christian and still a virgin, as is her boyfriend. People in secular circles are surprised to learn they have never had sex \u2013 \u201cMy boyfriend\u2019s business partner wondered if he\u2019s secretly gay since we\u2019re not doing it\u201d \u2013 but then so are some Christians. These days, she says, most young evangelicals have premarital sex (or rush into marriage). \u201cI was actually surprised that my boyfriend is a virgin \u2013 that\u2019s how common it is.\u201d It is not easy staying chaste, Julia says \u2013 \u201cwe have to be proactively careful about that\u201d, particularly when they are travelling together \u2013 but their church community keeps them accountable. \u201cAnd I have a very full and rich life as a virgin.\u201d That said, she and her boyfriend are seriously discussing marriage; she\u2019s already warned him that they are going to \u201chave sex every day, seven days a week\u201d (although the novelty may wear off, she concedes). \u201cI\u2019m excited to have sex with my future husband. What we lack in experience, we\u2019ll learn together.\u201d But, Julia agrees, as a virgin by choice she is an anomaly. For others the hurdles can seem insurmountable. Jim, a 35-year-old from East Sussex, has never been kissed. He had few friends in secondary school, where his confidence was shot by bullying, and his social circle has dwindled since then. Like Richard, he is sober, thereby missing out on pubs and clubs \u2013 \u201cthe main route for kids in the 90s to have gotten together with someone\u201d. He works in IT, a male-dominated industry, and although he has some hobbies (archery, rock-climbing) he feels women there aren\u2019t open to being approached, if he even knew how. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to seem unwelcome or forceful.\u201d Holding him back, he says, are absence of opportunity, his looks (he describes himself as in shape but balding, and \u201cjust not nice-looking\u201d), his shyness and his lack of self-confidence \u2013 which worsens with each passing year. He has never told anyone that he is a virgin. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that has come up. If it did, I would probably lie and say that I had sex when I was 16 or 18 but that I haven\u2019t had it in ages. It\u2019s never having been in a relationship that bothers me more.\u201d For that reason, he says, he decided against going to a sex worker when he considered it a few years ago. \u201cI got to thinking that if I paid for it, that would probably make me feel even more worthless.\u201d Sex, as he sees it, is a destination, but he is more interested in the journey. \u201cIt\u2019s the getting a girlfriend, a partner \u2013 going to places with someone, who you can talk about your day with, and they\u2019ll be listening. \u2018Virgin\u2019 is the easiest tag to apply, but there\u2019s more to it than that. It\u2019s an experience that\u2019s been missing from me, and from other people.\u201d It bothers him more some days than it does others, he says \u2013 but the number of times he has avoided a town centre because of not wanting to see couples is \u201cworryingly high\u201d. Richard says something similar. \u201cWhen I meet someone or see someone I find attractive, instead of feeling a little spark, there\u2019s just a feeling in the pit in my stomach that says: \u2018Nothing\u2019s ever going to happen.\u2019\u201d Libby, however, is feeling good about the future. Over the past few years her health has improved, allowing her to invest in her work, home, family and friendships. At New Year\u2019s, she realised that her only regret about the years she had spent unwell was her lack of dating and sexual experience. She changed medication \u201cand it seems to be the right cocktail. I\u2019m feeling better than I have in a long time and, as an unexpected bonus, my libido woke up.\u201d She has since signed up for two online dating sites and had more good experiences than bad. Until very recently, only her two closest friends knew she was a virgin. \u201cNow that I\u2019m dating, I find myself telling potential interests fairly early on,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a great way to weed out undesirable guys.\u201d She hopes her future partners will be patient, open to teaching, and willing to go at her pace. \u201cI know it won\u2019t be perfect or like a romance novel or a porn video, but it will be my first time, on my terms. And a weight will be lifted off my shoulders.\u201d All names have been changed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
