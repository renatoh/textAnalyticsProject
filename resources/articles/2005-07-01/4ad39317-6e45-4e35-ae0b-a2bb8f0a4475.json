The FA's move to a zero tolerance policy on abuse will dominate the agenda at the annual referees' conference where Keith Hackett, the manager of England's referees, will tell Premier League and Football League officials that any player who abuses an official by word or gesture is to be sent off from the start of the new season. The crackdown, instigated by FA chief executive Brian Barwick, is a response to damaging global images that have tarnished the Premiership's reputation and led youngsters into believing it is acceptable to abuse referees. Soho Square insiders admit the behaviour of Wayne Rooney has been the catalyst for action. The Manchester United and England teenager escaped without being booked by Graham Poll when he subjected the top referee to a four-letter tirade at Highbury last season. The former Everton striker will not figure in a \"respect the referee\" poster campaign being launched by the FA. Greater Manchester Police yesterday issued an ultimatum to Wigan and warned the club that they will not be able to police next season's Premiership matches if an outstanding bill is not paid by August 1. Wigan's chairman Dave Whelan feels that the bill was far too high and has so far refused to pay. Middlesbrough have rejected a bid from Tottenham for England midfielder Stewart Downing and warned them not to bother making another one. The club confirmed this afternoon they had received and turned down an offer, believed to be in the region of \u00a36million, for the 20-year-old winger and reiterated their intention to hold on to him. \"We have had an approach from Tottenham regarding Stewart Downing,\" said chief executive Keith Lamb."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
