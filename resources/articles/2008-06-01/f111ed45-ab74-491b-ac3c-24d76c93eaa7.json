Clayton has a coolly delicate touch and gleaming sound (he has been recorded so well that it sounds as if strings are being hit right inside your head), and drummer Montez Coleman and bassist Danton Boller mesh as if they were one mind with four limbs. That's the only problem: it sounds as if a mistake might be a sacking offence, and since the idiom is so familiar, the atmosphere of infallibility gives it the unjazzy character of an act rather than a music-making adventure. There's a classic Herbie Hancock feel to Starmaker; Hargrove's deep and plummy sound finds one of its subtlest outlets on his ballad Joy Is Sorrow Unmasked; the backbeat-driven, keyboard-clanging Mr Clean is an irresistible groover - with the leader igniting a flamethrowing high-pitched trumpet break off it. Anyone who has heard this irrepressible band live will find its flat-out entertainment value well reflected here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
