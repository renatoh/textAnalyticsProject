Feel free to laugh. As everybody now knows, by the end of the transfer window the phrase \"makes Darren Bent look a bargain\" was outdoing \"the game's gone mad\" and \"do me a favour, love\" for topical hilarity. January was certainly eventful, even exciting for fans of the Sky Sports viewathon willing to put up with hours of ennui just for a glimpse of the Spurs manager through a car window or confirmation on the ticker that Andy Carroll was on the move. If this is going to be the pattern for the future it is an unedifying way for football to go about its business. Last season \u00a330m worth of deals were done in January by Premier League clubs, amid a general consensus that value was not to be had in the winter window and long-term planning was better served by obtaining players in summer. Even allowing for the fact that this year's headline figure of \u00a3225m included money being spent twice \u2013 Liverpoool's net spend was \u00a32m, for instance \u2013 the sudden leap suggests a panic factor, an increased desperation. It turns out four clubs were responsible for 80% of the buying, and sure enough Aston Villa were as desperate to avoid relegation as Chelsea were to stay in the Champions League, while Liverpool had to be seen to back a new manager and put a brave face on the loss of Fernando Torres. Manchester City are far from desperate in any normal sense \u2013 they are far from normality in most senses \u2013 yet they have been buying big at almost every opportunity and it could be argued they have more reasons than most to feel a top-four finish is essential this season. So what, you may say. Inequality in English football is nothing new, the Champions League has seen to that. There will always be big teams doing their best to stay at the top while, towards the bottom, clubs such as Everton and Wolves soldier on with their original pack rations. It may even be the case that the 2010 was the anomalous window: \u00a3225m does not represent that great an increase on \u00a3170m in 2009 or \u00a3175m the year before, so perhaps there is nothing to worry about. Football is largely spending its own money. Only the cut taken by agents goes out of the game, and that is more than offset by the vast amounts flowing into football from private wealth beyond these shores. Similarly, while it could be argued that too high a proportion of fees went straight out of the country to European clubs and foreign representatives, one only has to consider the \u00a380m Manchester United received for Cristiano Ronaldo to see the business logic. Regrettable as it may be that only around \u00a312m of last month's splurge went directly to clubs in the lower English leagues, the possibility exists that the players there simply aren't good enough. Not good enough to be sold on for two or three times the buying price, at any rate. One indication that this has not been business as usual, however, was the number of players obliged to submit transfer requests so that the selling club could take the money and still present themselves to fans as powerless to prevent a departure. The paying supporters, as usual, are the ones being short-changed. Sunderland fans bought season tickets in the reasonable expectation of seeing Bent for the whole season, Liverpool followers suspected Torres might not stick around for much longer but could hardly have predicted he would shaft the club to an extent mitigated only by the size of the fee. At least Liverpool swiftly replaced Torres; Newcastle fans were not so lucky. There seems little point in Geordies continuing to mythologise home-grown No9s if they are going to be shipped out so unceremoniously once a price trigger is reached. While the extreme lateness of some of the trading may have made for a slightly more interesting Monday night than usual, that is a high price to pay if the season suddenly flatlines, as Newcastle's is in danger of doing now Shola Ameobi is injured. The winter window was originally envisaged as an opportunity for readjustment, a safety valve for clubs who may have made mistakes in summer or been hit by injuries. At the same time, it acted as an outlet for the less wealthy to relieve cashflow problems with a timely sale. The trouble now is that very little of this is happening. Big clubs use the window to make strategically timed raids that are hard to counter. Favourite players disappear halfway through the season, too often leaving the impression that they have merely been treading water while waiting for the January lifeboat. Carroll does not appear to have been guilty of any such thing, yet that did not stop his employers shamefully accusing him of disloyalty even as they scooped in the cash. Far from making life easier, January is turning football sleazier. If contracts are worth so little, it would be better to have them run summer to summer without interruption. That way a degree of long-term planning would be forced on clubs and spectators would know what they were signing up for. A small adjustment period would still be desirable for unforeseen emergencies, but Europe's leading leagues could be restricted from buying from each other mid\u2011season, or from within. Top clubs being forced to scour lower leagues for January reinforcements would be beneficial all-round, with less of the same money changing hands and fewer deals being set up by the same super-agents. Such a sticking plaster solution may be all that is required, not the annual crisis presently built into the game's constitution. Sky would struggle to make their winter totaliser overheat, but there's always summer. They can still talk to Harry Redknapp through the car window."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
