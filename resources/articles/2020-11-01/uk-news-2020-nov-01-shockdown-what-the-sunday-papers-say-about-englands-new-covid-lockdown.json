The Observer describes the move as \u201can extraordinary U-turn\u201d that comes amid accusations that government indecision \u201cwill cost lives and livelihoods across the country\u201d. Under the new measures, non-essential shops and venues, as well as pubs and restaurants, will be closed, the Observer reports. Schools, colleges and universities will remain open. The public will be told only to leave home for specific reasons, such as work if they cannot work from home, to shop for food and essentials, exercise, medical appointments or caring for the vulnerable. The original furlough scheme under which the state paid 80% of workers\u2019 wages will be extended for the duration of the new lockdown. It is \u201canother major reversal\u201d, the Observer says, and has angered regional leaders who have spent weeks pleading for extra support. The Sunday Mirror also reports warnings that delays imposing a lockdown in England will cost both lives and jobs. The headline: \u201cSHOCKDOWN\u201d. \u201cFears of \u2018medical disaster\u2019 forced the PM into new lockdown\u201d, says the Sunday Times. The announcement came as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the UK hit a grim milestone, the paper reports. More than a million people have been diagnosed with Covid-19 since March. \u201cLockdown sparks Tory civil war\u201d, says the front page of the Mail on Sunday. Cabinet ministers and Tory MPs believe the new restrictions will further devastate the economy and are furious that they learned of the new measures through newspaper reports. The Sunday Telegraph\u2019s headline is \u201cFour-week lockdown \u2018to save NHS\u2019 as millions face return to furlough\u201d. The paper also carries reports of anger among Tory MPs. It features a comment piece from former conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, who describes the lockdown announcement as a \u201cbody blow to the British people\u201d and accuses the prime minister of \u201cgiving in to the advice of his scientific advisers\u201d. The paper cites a warning from Johnson that the health service may not be able to cope unless the virus is halted. The Independent asks: \u201cWhat has taken Boris Johnson so long?\u201d It points out that, more than one month ago, Sage recommended a circuit-breaker to slow the spread of the virus. The Sunday Express has \u201cLockdown 2 to avoid disaster\u201d, and reports the PM\u2019s \u201cplea to save the NHS and Christmas\u201d. It says the sudden change of heart was needed to save the health service being overwhelmed. The Scottish Mail on Sunday\u2019s splash is \u201cShut down the border\u201d, reporting Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s move to close the border, with the warning that no one should travel from Scotland to other parts of the UK."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
