It had not been fun and easy for Blank up to that point. Every time she moved from one city apartment to another, she would \u201ctry to integrate plants into my home,\u201d she says, but, \u201cI would just kill every single one of them.\u201d She noticed friends facing similar struggles: they neither knew of convenient places to buy plants nor, crucially, how to look after them. Monsteras slowly dwindled; peace lilies faded to stem; fronds slumped to an unhappy limp\u2026 You couldn\u2019t call it a bloodbath, really, but there was slaughter. \u201cPlants are assuredly good!\u201d Blank says. But where to buy them in the city and how to become a dutiful plant parent? \u201cI asked: \u2018Why isn\u2019t there a consumer brand that can elevate this to commodity status?\u2019\u201d She became frustrated at first, then excited, the way entrepreneurs do, I suppose, when landing on a new growth opportunity. She would sell plants online! Bird\u2019s nest ferns. Cheese plants. Moss balls\u2026 then offer consumers helpful information about how to not kill them. Blank\u2019s Kickstarter campaign raised $12,632, hardly big money, but enough as a seedling. She was banking on houseplants becoming rising stars of commerce \u2013 snake plants as retail phenoms. The market was ripe, she thought, or at least ripening, because she had noticed houseplants appearing more frequently online. And she was right. In the years since the Sill launched, business has grown month by month, in tandem with the increased standing of the houseplant as an arbiter of millennial taste. The American gardening industry alone is now worth $48bn, according to the National Gardening Association. That is big business and it is getting bigger. Younger fingers in particular are becoming greener. Last year Blank sold more than 100,000 plants, more than 270 a day, predominantly to millennials, pulling in around $5m in revenue, she says \u2013 profits succulent enough to keep investors chirpy. To meet consumer demand, the brand recently opened three bricks-and-mortar stores, two in New York and one in Los Angeles. It is no great leap to assume that the yucca you just \u201cliked\u201d on Instagram, positioned carefully in the corner of a Brooklyn loft, or a Manhattan brownstone, or even some condo in Middle America \u2013 the Sill does not discriminate by postal code \u2013 comes from Blank\u2019s stock. Plants were not one of Blank\u2019s childhood passions. Before launching the Sill, she worked in marketing, and she thinks like a retail strategist: how can we best reach consumers and ensure they\u2019re happy? How can we convince our customer base of the must-have status of the kentia palm? The same can be said of Freddie Blackett, also a former marketeer, also once not so green-fingered. In 2015 Blackett launched Patch, an online platform that sells houseplants to homes in London. By his own admission, he had few horticultural credentials before setting Patch up, but he too sensed an opportunity: how the millennial interest in technology, wellness, the climate and interior design might converge to transform the houseplant into a valuable commodity. Last year, Blackett sold 120,000 plants, more than 320 a day, and created a video series that helps customers care for their recent purchases. In my experience, the videos have gone viral in a kind of traditional sense. They pop up in my Instagram feed like troublesome weeds. In the millennial mode, the Patch website is easy to use but idiosyncratic enough to be inviting and the brand\u2019s packaging is elegant and simple. The same is true of the Sill. Sometimes the delivery is as much a draw as the product itself. In an unboxing video posted online, one YouTuber described a package as \u201ckinda big\u201d but \u201creally cool\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re in a new era of e-commerce,\u201d the YouTuber says, with excitement, \u201cwhere everyone is questioning what can and can\u2019t we ship through the mail. The Sill is proving that you can ship a beautiful houseplant to you safe and sound!\u201d A message on the delivery reads: \u201cPlants Make People Happy.\u201d Both the Sill and Patch focus a large part of their marketing on a curious fiction: that plants are somehow active care-givers, able to alleviate all sorts of modern ills: anxiety, loneliness, indoor air pollution, the problem of great social-media content. An article posted on the Sill\u2019s website titled, \u201cWhy You Need Plants in Your Life\u201d includes a list of benefits that the brand says are backed by scientific studies. In an age of mental fatigue, houseplants \u201cboost mood, productivity, concentration and creativity\u201d. In an era of climate disaster, they \u201cclean indoor air by absorbing toxins\u201d. As work continues to define us, they \u201creduce stress\u201d, and can prevent \u201csore throats and colds\u201d. Plants \u201care therapeutic,\u201d one line reads, \u201cand cheaper than a therapist\u201d. This language is savvy enough to acknowledge the fact that millennials, craving comfort, have been widely reported to be relying on houseplants to fill a vacuum. We are struggling to connect with each other. We are struggling to connect with our planet, which is not-so-gradually falling to pieces. We are invited to think: might a houseplant help? Blackett, in a clever early move, decided to baptise Patch products with human names \u2013 Chaz, the Swiss cheese plant (from \u00a314); Fidel, the fiddle-leaf fig (from \u00a312) \u2013 so as to rely less on Latin terms, which he worried might become a stumbling block for consumers, but also, you\u2019d have thought, to suggest a more personal connection between houseplant and owner. Somehow, not long ago, the phrase \u201cplant parenthood\u201d, often prefixed with a hashtag, entered the lexicon as a legitimate term. It is no longer unusual to nourish and attend to a parlour palm as if it were offspring. \u201cMy fussy calatheas are starting to get brown tips because they lack humidity,\u201d one Twitter user wrote recently. \u201cI mean, seriously girls? It\u2019s been hella humid!\u201d Can a houseplant fill so big a void? The answer, really, is hardly. A peace lily will never replace a partner, nor a child, nor even a pet (though sometimes you wonder). As far as I\u2019m aware, no proud plant parent has launched an Instagram account dedicated to his cute monstera, in the way pet lovers frequently do for their animal dependents. And it\u2019s doubtful whether a houseplant can affect the air to the degree necessary to create human benefit, though the marketeers will try to sell you on it. Both Patch and the Sill include links to lists of \u201cair-purifying plants\u201d \u2013 \u201cGrow your own fresh air\u201d \u2013 though neither seems to agree on which plants are most purifying. \u201cIn theory, the claims are true,\u201d Curtis Gubb, a PhD student in environmental health at the University of Birmingham, who is investigating how effective housplants are at removing harmful indoor pollutants, told me. Plants have been found to remove all kinds of pollutants, he said, \u201cbut just because a plant removes something doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s affecting the room. You\u2019d need 100 plants in a small room,\u201d to have a significant effect. He added that, really, houseplants are \u201cvery unlikely to clean the air.\u201d The science, he says, is well behind the claims. Most of us can agree that plants are good, fundamental to our existence somehow, though often the benefits are subjective. In a recently published essay, the late neurologist Oliver Sacks praised the \u201chealing power of gardens\u201d. \u201cAs a physician, I take my patients to gardens whenever possible,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn 40 years of medical practice, I have found only two types of non-pharmaceutical \u2018therapy\u2019 to be vitally important for patients with chronic neurological diseases: music and gardens.\u201d A line on the Sill reads: \u201cEven brief exposure to nature has been shown to make us more altruistic and co-operative,\u201d and later, presumably to hammer home the point: \u201cIt\u2019s true when we say plants make people happy.\u201d A few months ago, I ordered a peace lily from Patch. It arrived wrapped in plastic and planted in a distressed ceramic pot I\u2019d bought as an add-on. I placed it immediately in my bathroom, because I\u2019d read somewhere, rightly or wrongly, that it would thrive in all that after-shower humidity. When a couple of weeks later I went on holiday with my family, strict care instructions were given to my neighbour. To my surprise, the plant was the first thing I checked when we arrived home. Was it still alive? Had it missed me? Yes, it was thriving \u2013 my neighbour had done an excellent job of not killing it. And, no, of course it hadn\u2019t missed me. I am not too proud to admit I felt a little disgruntled. I might need the plant, I thought, but the plant does not need me."}, "isHosted": false}}}
