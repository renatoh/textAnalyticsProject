Adil El Tayar, 63, died on Wednesday at West Middlesex university hospital in London, his family said. The doctor, who had worked around the world, spent his final days volunteering on the frontlines against the outbreak in an A&amp;E department in the Midlands. \u201cHe wanted to be deployed where he would be most useful in the crisis,\u201d his cousin, British-Sudanese journalist Zeinab Badawi, said in a moving tribute on BBC Radio 4. \u201cIt had taken just 12 days for Adil to go from a seemingly fit and capable doctor working in a busy hospital to lying in a hospital morgue.\u201d Tayar started self-isolating at home after developing symptoms about two weeks ago, but was taken to hospital and placed on a ventilator after his condition worsened. Four days later medics told his family that his lungs had \u201ccome under attack\u201d from the virus and he could no longer breathe unaided. \u201cUntil I had learned of Adil\u2019s death I had been fairly phlegmatic about the pandemic,\u201d Badawi said. \u201cBut there is nothing like a death in the family to bring home the realities of what we are facing.\u201d Badawi learned of her cousin\u2019s death on Thursday, three minutes before she joined millions across the UK in applauding NHS workers. She said: \u201cClapping along with my neighbours engendered in me a feeling of unity that we are all in this together and that we sink or swim together. \u201cPerhaps this transformation will be permanent. I hope it will be.\u201d Former colleague Abbas Ghaznafar, a renal transplant surgeon at St George\u2019s University in Tooting, described Tayar as a \u201cnoble human being\u201d who was a \u201chard-working, dedicated surgeon\u201d. Dr Hisam El Khidir, another of the surgeon\u2019s cousins, told the BBC that he suspected Tayar had caught the virus while working on frontlines. The British ambassador to Sudan Irfan Siddiq tweeted: \u201cSaddened to hear of Sudanese doctor Adel Altayar\u2019s death in the UK from Covid-19. \u201cHealth workers around the world have shown extraordinary courage. We cannot thank them enough. In this fight we must listen to their advice.\u201d Tayar leaves behind a wife and four children, two of whom also work as doctors in the NHS. El Khidir told the BBC: \u201cAdil was someone who was central to our family, who was well respected by so many people. \u201cSince his death on Wednesday, I have had hundreds of text messages from his colleagues and friends. He will be sorely missed.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
