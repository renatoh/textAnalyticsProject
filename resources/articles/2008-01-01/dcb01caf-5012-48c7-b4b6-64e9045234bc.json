Coming from Norway but dreaming of the Beach Boys' west coast and shoegazing's perkier peaks, the band's debut album is the aural equivalent of young love's first heady rush - a parade of rolling drums, shimmery organs and shiny guitars that awakens the senses as much as an hour in a tub of minty bubble bath. But as with all of music's jauntier moments, prolonged exposure to pure, clear harmonies, rich major chords and incessant mentions of love, dreams and discos gets you craving a few dirtier corners very quickly. Still, in bite-sized bursts, this is aural sugar that fizzes deliciously."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
