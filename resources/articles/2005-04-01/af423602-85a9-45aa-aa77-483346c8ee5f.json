Indeed, Internazionale have only lost two matches in all competitions this season, against ... you've guessed it - their neighbours Milan; who play Ned Flanders to their Homer Simpson. Tonight's nominal home-side make four changes from the side that lost 2-0 in the first leg, with their talismanic striker Adriano being the most noteworthy. He comes in despite being not fully recovered from a bout of knee-knack and will play up front with Kily Gonzalez. Julio Cruz and Obafemi Martins make way. Elsewhere in the Inter line-up, Marco Materazzi and Andy van der Meyde both start, instead of Sinisa Mihajlovic and Dejan Stankovich, who are suspended ... or injured ... or dropped ... or otherwise indisposed. AC Milan make just the one change tonight from the team that won last week - Massimo Ambrosini comes in for Genero Gattuso. The teams Inter Milan: 1-Francesco Toldo; 4-Javier Zanetti (c), 2-Ivan Cordoba, 23-Marco Materazzi, 16-Giuseppe Favalli; 7-Andy van der Meyde, 6-Cristiano Zanetti, 14-Juan Sebastian Veron, 19-Esteban Cambiasso, 18-Kily Gonzalez; 10-Adriano Subs: Carini, Mihajlovic, Ze Maria, Karagounis, Cruz, Martins, Vieri. AC Milan: 1-Dida; 2-Cafu, 31-Jaap Stam, 13-Alessandro Nesta, 3-Paolo Maldini (c); 23-Massimo Ambrosini, 21-Andrea Pirlo, 22-Kaka, 20-Clarence Seedorf; 7-Andriy Shevchenko, 11-Hernan Crespo Subs:Abbiati, Kaladze, Pancaro, Rui Costa, Serginho, Brocchi, Tomasson. Referee: Markus Merk (Germany) For a recap on what happened in the first leg click here. To read the minute-by-minute report from the first leg, click this bit like your life depends on it. Prediction corner \"Come on Barry, no sitting on the fence: what's your prediction?\" inquires Jack Lee. Well Jack, against my better judgement I've stuck \u00a335 on there being more than two goals in this match tonight (to win \u00a350) and I couldn't care less who scores them as long as they go in. I'll go for Inter 1 - 3 AC Milan, which means it'll probably be a nil-niller. 1 min: After the fancy music and the handshakes, the teams stand around waiting for kick-off. Inter wear hoops of varying degrees of blue on them, with black/navy shorts and socks. AC Milan wear their usual black and red stripes, with white shorts and white socks. Inter kick-off, needing a minimum of two goals. 2 mins: Inter win a free-kick about 40 yards out on the right flank. Juan Sebastian Veron's delivery to the near post isn't great, but Ivan Cordoba still manages to get a thigh on it. Wide. 3 mins: Marco Materazzi goes down in a heap off the ball, holding his head. A replay shows that Andriy Shevchenko butted him in the face, but neither the referee nor the linesman saw it. The Ukraine striker gets away with it - he should have been sent off. If he gets a retrospective three-match ban from Uefa, he could miss two semi-finals and a final. He might only get two matches though, because it was only Marco Materazzi. 4 mins: Kily Gonzalez gets booked for Massimo Ambrosini, who gets booked a minute later for exacting swift retribution. Free-kick for Inter wide on the left. Again, Juan Sebastien Veron's delivery is poor and Clarence Seedorf heads clear. 8 mins: For AC Milan, Kaka shoots low and hard from outside the box after the referee had played the advantage following a foul on Pirlo. The Brazilian's daisy-cutter takes a defection and goes wide. 9 mins: Adriano drifts out to the left flank, picks up the ball, drops his shoulder and goes on a surging run past two defenders and into the Milan penalty area. A stop is put to his gallop when he runs into traffic. Milan counter and Ivan Cordoba gets booked for hacking down Kaka, who was going on a blistering run through the centre. Free-kick for Milan, just outside the D of the Inter box. Andrea Pirlo sends it low, hard, right and about three feet wide. 13 mins: Alessandro Nesta concedes a free-kick after upending Adriano wide on the left. Juan Sebastien Veron stings the palms of Milan goalkeeper Dida with a thunderous free-kick. Great effort! Corner for Inter, which Alessandro Nesta heads clear. 15 mins: \"What's your prediction for the last English team in the competition, then?\" asks Duncan McVerry. \"As we know those ring-kissers are on their way out tonight, it must be Liverpool.\" I'll be honest with you on two counts Duncan. (1) I couldn't care less if either or both of them go out. (2) I'm just glad those Chelsea boys kiss their own rings when they score. It'd make for very unpleasant viewing if they started kissing each other's, especially before the watershed. 19 mins: Like a lot of encounters involving Italian sides, this match is breath-takingly skillful, technically excellent and very absorbing ... without actually being any good. 21 mins: Zanetti nudges Andriy Shevchenko just inside the Inter half, and the Ukrainian striker goes down as if he's just been picked off by a sniper high in the stands. He is so lucky not to have been sent off for a magnificent Milan-kiss straight into the bridge of Marco Materazzi's nose in the opening minutes. 24 mins: This from Chris in Philadelphia: \"Since this game is bound to be as boring as watching paint dry, here are some questions to keep you entertained: How does the Guardian assign commentators? Will you get the Liverpool game tomorrow? I think you secretly enjoy watching Liverpool.\" To answer your first question ... it was a very complicated three-step process, Chris. (1) Rob Smyth asked me which match I wanted to do. (2) I said Inter v AC Milan. (3) That's it. To answer your second question - yes. Now here's a question for you - what in the name of all that's good and holy makes you think anyone would be entertained by questions that dull? 29 mins: Inter 0 - 1 Milan (Agg: 0 - 3) Just the four needed by Inter now, against a team who've only conceded three in the competition to date, I believe. Andriy Shevchenko scores an absolute scorcher. Standing on the left flank, he was passed the ball before he cut a couple of steps inside to the corner of the box and sent a left-footed howitzer across the face of goal and into the top left-hand corner past the helpless Francesco Toldo. 33 mins: While I was slowing chiselling out all that guff, Kily Gonzalez and Adriano both went close, sending efforts narrowly wide of the foot of Milan's left upright. Adriano actually had a decent penalty-shout turned down, as Cafu was trying to mount him when his effort bounced wide. 36 mins: Wide on the left, Shevchenko is picked out by Hernan Crespo. He gallops 10 yards forward and crosses from the touchline to Cafu at the far post, who gets shoved in the back just as he heads the ball. He scuffs his header wide before appealing for a penalty. He doesn't get one - what goes around comes around. 38 mins: \"Rather than any three-match ban, Shevchenko should get a medal for giving that sly, fouling, cheating Everton reject a taste of his own medicine,\" writes Ben Fitzpatrick. An Everton reject indeed. From Goodison Park to representing Internazionale in a Champions League quarter-final - how the mighty have fallen! Having said all that, Shevchenko's not a dirty player and never has been, so I'm sure Materazzi did deserve that loaf in the face. 42 mins: Alessandro Nesta and Adriano both get treatment after a collision, which sees the Brazilian - albeit accidentally - stamp on the Italian's bollocks. As if that wasn't painful enough, Nesta gets a yellow card to add insult to injury. He'll miss the semi-final first leg if Milan go through. 45 mins: \"Wouldn't it be funny if Inter score three now and go out on away goals when both legs were at 'home'?\" suggests Duncan McVerry, whose idea of what constitutes good comedy is almost as scary as Chris in Philadelphia's idea of good entertainment. Half-time Half-time chat \"Was Shevchenko's headbutt \u00e0 la Julian Dicks or \u00e0 la Jonathan Greening?\" asks Ryan in Detroit. It was very much from the Julian Dicks/Yosser Hughes school, Ryan - the kind of headbutt other headbutts doff their hats to and call The Guvnor. Jonathan Greening's effort wasn't worthy of the descritpion \"headbutt\". All he did was vigorously massage another player's forehead with his own. Where was the sudden forward motion? \"Just cos Marco Materazzi moved from a pikey northern outfit to the mighty Internazionale doesnt make him any good,\" writes Ben Fitzpatrick. \"Just look at Paul Ince.\" \"Are you just really bitter that your ancestors didn't come across the Atlantic in the 19th century like most of Ireland, or do you thank your blessings every morning that you're in London?\" writes Bobby Otter in Chicago, who for no apparent reason seems to have decided that I'm really bitter. Nothing could be further from the truth - I'm a sparkling ray of sunshine. \"The words 'sudden', 'forward' and 'motion' in a sentence involving Jonathan Greening? Wonders will never cease,\" badoom-tishes Ryan O'Hare. 45 mins: Inter need four goals in 45 minutes, so they've withdrawn Kily Gonzalez and Cristiano Zanetti, and sent on a notoriously racist Serbian centre-half and an Argentine striker. Sinisa Mihajlovic and Pedro Cruz, for it is they, take up their positions and the second half gets underway. 49 mins: Inter's gamble on starting Adriano appears to have backfired. He's hobbling around looking worse than useless and eventually gets helped off the field, to be replaced by Obafemi Martins. 51 mins: Within seconds of being introduced, Martins almost scores. Cruz puts him through one-on-one against Dida in the Milan goal with a deft flick, but from a narrow angle, the striker shoots the ball against the goalkeeper and on to the post. Should have done better. 53 mins: Free kick for Inter about 40 yards out, slightly to the left of goal. Up steps Sinisa Mihajlovic, who whips the dead-ball around the ball and wide of the right upright. 55 mins: \"Is betting on a fixture that you are commentating on a conflict of interest?\" inquires Mat Whittington in Washington. \"You being a purveyor of 'news', who's to say you won't add in a last minute 'equalizer' in the hopes that someone at Ladbrokes may be following along and you'll be up 15 quid.\" I can see where you're coming from, Mat, but it would never work for a number of reasons. 1. I need two more goals, not one. 2. There's \u00a350 profit at stake, not \u00a315. 3. I wouldn't put a bet on with Ladbrokes if they were the last gambling outlet on earth. 58 mins: For Milan, Kaka pelts down the left wing. With Hernan Crespo unmarked and screaming for the ball at the far post, the Brazilian sends a feeble attempt at a cross straight into Francesco Toldo's arms. 61 mins: A corner for Inter, who haven't given up yet. Nothing comes of it and Milan clear. Inter win the ball back, Favalli gets in behind the defence and sends a cross looping across to the far post where ... there's nobody waiting. 65 mins: Not a great deal going on at the San Siro. A lot of midfield faffery, but no real goalscoring chances. Both defences are looking fairly impregnable. 67 mins: \"For years I have searched for the reason people called Hughes are nicknamed 'Yosser',\" writes Mike in Vancouver. \"I went to school with one and have met them all over the place, but no one can say why they're nicknamed that - any enlightenment?\" I think it's because years ago there was a very bleak drama called Boys From The Blackstuff on British television, set during the miners' strike. One of the main characters was a mentallist named Yosser Hughes, whose particular field of expertise was headbutting people who ticked him off. The actor who played him went on to star in Lord Of The Rings, although I can't remember his name. 71 mins: Inter have what looks like a perfectly good goal disallowed, when Dida flaps at an inswinger and Cambiasso heads into the net. The referee disallows it for an infringement by Cruz on Dida. There was no infringement. That's three times now the referee has riffed all over Inter's pain. His performance has been shocking tonight. 73 mins: The fans behind Dida's goal are pelting the AC Milan goalkeeper with flares and bottles of water. As he clears away some of the debris, one flare hits him on the shoulder and he gets taken away for treatment. He's okay, but he could have got a very nasty burn if he'd been facing the other way. His penalty area is now totally obscured by smoke, the match has stopped and the players from both teams are standing around waiting to see what's going to happen next. Five minutes later:The match hasn't restarted yet. Dida is getting treatment and has an ice-pack on his shoulder and lit flares and water bottles are still raining down on the Inter penalty area. With Javier Zanetti, Juan Sebastien Veron and a couple of firemen attempting to clear up the litter in the box, the question everybody's asking is: If this match is abandoned will I get a refund on my stupid bet? Here's hoping. Another five minutes later: The stand behind the AC Milan goal is almost empty now, but the few spectators that remain are still hurling down flares, smoke-bombs and bottles at the referee and their own players. Both teams and the officials finally escape down the tunnel, which is in one corner under the stand where all the trouble is. More pointless filler: As the good and the great on ITV2 pontificate at great length about what a terrible disgrace Internazionale's fans are, Tim Bower writes: \"Yosser Hughes was played by Bernard Hill,\" he says. \"His catchphrase was 'gizza job ... I can do that'.\" Still no action: But potentially good news for me. \"If the match is abandoned, Uefa will award Milan a 3-0 victory which means you win the bet with three goals being 'scored',\" writes Guy Harvey. Possibly, Guy, but the word in the ITV2 studio is that the ref has every intention of bringing the players back out to restart the match. \"Bernard Hill played both Yosser and Theoden,\" writes Grace Pickering informatively, as ITV2 go for an ad-break, while John Hird writes in to show me up for the know-nothing cad I am: \"Boys From The Black Stuff was set in Liverpool in 1980 before the Miners' Strike\". Play resumes: The match restarts with 72mins on the clock, but 30 seconds later the referee calls the players off the field once more when the flares and plastic bottles come raining down from behind Dida's goal again. While the Milan players applaud their own fans as they troupe off the pitch, ITV2 commentators Peter Drury and Jim Beglin are on the verge of exploding with pompous, sanctimonious wailing and righteous indignation at the outrage that is unfolding before them: \"But what about the children?\" Where's Bono when you need him? Anyway, it's only several thousand plastic bottles and a big cloud of smoke - hardly an unprecedented event at a Milan derby. Far be it from me to condone this kind of guff, but Inter's fans do have every right to be upset, as their side has been robbed by referee Markus Merk tonight. He failed to send off Andriy Shevchenko for a blatant headbutt before the Ukrainian scored, he denied Inter a penalty and then disallowed a perfectly legitimate goal by Esteban Cambiasso. Is it any wonder they've got the hump? So, with 18 minutes left to go, the match has been abandoned with AC Milan leading 1-0 on the night and 3-0 on aggregate. They'll certainly go through to the semi-finals, while we'll all await Inter's punishment from Uefa with interet. Anyway, that's it from me tonight - thanks for your time and your emails."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
