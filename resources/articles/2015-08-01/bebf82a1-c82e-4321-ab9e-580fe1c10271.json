The stakes for Alan Pardew and his team have raised a notch, however, and many more performances in the vein of this disciplined win will perpetuate the theory that they are capable of doing better than bloodying the occasional nose. \u201cWe\u2019re south London, we know where we are,\u201d said Pardew, whose team were pushed back during a frenetic first quarter-hour but, by the 49th minute, merited the two-goal lead that would eventually prove decisive. \u201cThe fans know where we are. They are enjoying the ride and let them enjoy it. I\u2019m not going to throw water over their fire of enthusiasm.\u201d Norwich had a creditable go at doing that themselves and should have taken the lead when Lewis Grabban hit a post in front of an open goal from Steven Whittaker\u2019s cross. The error proved costly as Wilfried Zaha, who had swapped to his preferred left flank after an anonymous opening spell that led Pardew to admit he had miscalculated his starting lineup, adjusted well to volley in Jason Puncheon\u2019s cross. Damien Delaney appeared unchallenged to sweep in Palace\u2019s second after what was in equal measure a well-worked corner routine and a lesson in defensive negligence. Palace seemed comfortable but Nathan Redmond\u2019s 25-yard daisy cutter past Alex McCarthy, whose footwork seemed inadequate, restored Norwich\u2019s belief and they thought they had equalised when Cameron Jerome\u2019s 75th-minute overhead kick was deemed illegal by the referee. The reasoning was that Jerome\u2019s high boot had impeded Joel Ward\u2019s attempt to head clear; the home team bristled long after the close but Delaney, in close attendance, felt the decision was just reward for Palace\u2019s committed approach. \u201cJoel did brilliantly,\u201d Delaney said. \u201cHe gave the referee a decision to make. A lot of defenders wouldn\u2019t have stuck their head in the way Wardy did but he asked the question of the referee. If Wardy shies away from that there\u2019s no decision, it\u2019s a guaranteed goal, but that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been about in the last two or three years, putting bodies on the line and digging in when the going gets tough.\u201d There was more finesse about Palace\u2019s third goal, scored neatly by Yohan Cabaye after what had been a conservative debut, and the Norwich manager, Alex Neil, was left to reflect. \u201cWith the smaller teams like us and Bournemouth, if you\u2019ve just come up and lost, then [people will say]: \u2018They don\u2019t know what it takes. They lack this, they lack that.\u2019 But it\u2019s going to be decided over the course of time. \u201cI was pleased with how the boys acquitted themselves but the crucial part is to turn that dominance into goals. If it\u2019s 2-2, then we\u2019re the team that\u2019s going forward. But with the fine margin of the disallowed goal and them scoring as we\u2019re pushing to get ourselves back into the game, all of a sudden it\u2019s 3-1 and we\u2019re outclassed. That\u2019s how people will see it.\u201d That is true of much football analysis; it is fair to state that Neil\u2019s team played with a resilience and, at their best, a tempo that suggest they will be nobody\u2019s fools between now and May. Grabban\u2019s miss, however, and the way in which the centre-back S\u00e9bastien Bassong was exposed for pace by Puncheon before Zaha\u2019s goal spoke of deficiencies at both ends that will need addressing quickly. \u201cI\u2019d like to hope we\u2019d try to get someone in before Saturday [when Norwich play Sunderland] but I couldn\u2019t say for definite,\u201d said Neil. Palace\u2019s sharpness in those areas was that of a team further along the evolutionary scale and Pardew could appraise that their sturdiness had provided the platform for his attackers to make a difference. \u201cIt\u2019s about having players who can create a moment,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when not playing well we can get a moment that lifts us and gets us a goal. The resilience of the team is really strong. It was a tough game and we came through it. I can\u2019t tell you how important this result is to us.\u201d Man of the match Jason Puncheon (Crystal Palace)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
