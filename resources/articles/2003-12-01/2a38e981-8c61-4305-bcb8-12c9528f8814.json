That's the verdict of the consultation into the replacement of the GNVQ. The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority published the findings of its consultation today and announced that the qualification would be withdrawn by 2007. The General National Vocational Qualification (GNVQ), was introduced in 1992. In June last year, over 66,000 candidates took the intermediate level and 14,500 took the foundation level. But in 2000 the government announced that the qualification would be abolished and replaced with a new qualification after a period of consultation. The first phase of that consultation into what went wrong with the GNVQ and what it should be replaced with was published today. In a damning assessment of the qualification the consultation, report says: \"The pass rate for many GNVQ titles is a cause for concern. There has been little systematic research on this aspect of the qualification. \"However it is possible to conclude from the data that the qualification is not meeting the needs of a number of young people. It is equally possible that some young people are being inappropriately placed on programmes.\" At the intermediate level, art and design has the highest pass rate at 79.9%, while just 60% of engineers passed. While some employers liked the qualification, the consultation revealed that many didn't know anything about it. Findings also showed a mismatch between what is taught on the course and what employers want people to know. In a statement to colleges the QCA said today: \"GNVQ will be withdrawn in three stages from 2005-07, starting with titles with extremely low numbers of candidate entries ... Awarding bodies will share provision in the lead up to the full withdrawal of the qualification. \"This means that centres may need to transfer GNVQ entries to a different awarding body during the withdrawal period. However, the awarding bodies are working together with the regulatory authorities and the Joint Council for General Qualifications to make this transition process as smooth as possible.\" Progression, teaching and learning, and the approach to assessment were identified as the key elements needed in a replacement. The QCA revealed that the qualifications would be largely replaced in the first instance with new level one Btec diplomas. The government is currently developing vocational GCSEs which would be most widely used; and they are likely to include the former Ofsted chief Mike Tomlinson's report on the his review of 14 to19-year-old testing, which is expected in January. However, Judith Norrington the director of curriculum and quality at the Association of Colleges asked for a caution in the withdrawal of any qualification: \"We've been vocal in arguing for the continuation of the GNVQ for as long as there isn't a better alternative. \"The GNVQ has a foundation, an intermediate and an advanced level, it gives a ladder to climb for students who are not ready to go straight to GCSE. A vocational GCSE would still essentially be a GCSE, and it still wouldn't meet their needs. \"We would not defend GNVQs if and when there aren't better options available,\" Ms Norrington, adding that she hoped colleges would be given enough time to understand the changes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
