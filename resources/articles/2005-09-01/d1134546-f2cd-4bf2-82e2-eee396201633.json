It said that fewer non-essential knee and hip operations in Mississippi and Louisiana would affect profits as a disproportionate amount of sales were there. Other reasons for the S&amp;N warning were the launch of rival products in its core replacement hips and knees business, and a weaker dollar. The company, which sold its traditional bandage business and now concentrates on hi-tech medical devices, sells about half of its goods in the US."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
