Those who have been arrested will go through the proper process. And we expect the truth to be determined through that process and those responsible to be held accountable,\u201d Morrison said. On Saturday the foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, said she had conveyed to the Saudi ambassador to Australia earlier in the week the government\u2019s \u201cserious concern\u201d for Khashoggi\u2019s welfare and also directed the Australian ambassador in Riyadh to raise the matter with the Saudi government. \u201cWe strongly urge the Saudi authorities to conduct a thorough investigation and to cooperate fully with their Turkish counterparts in ascertaining the full circumstances of Mr Khashoggi\u2019s death,\u201d she said. \u201cWe call on Saudi Arabia to hold all those responsible to account for this egregious act against one of its citizens.\u201d The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, said that \u201cgiven the uncertainty around this disturbing event, and the results of investigations into it still pending\u201d, he did not believe Australia\u2019s attendance was \u201cappropriate at this time\u201d. The Future Investment Summit (FII) is in crisis after key sponsors pulled out, and finance ministers from France and the Netherlands announced they would not attend. On Thursday, the US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, followed suit. Last year, Australia sent the then trade minister, Steven Ciobo, and a sponsored delegation of Australian companies. That contingent had already been downgraded before Saturday \u2013 only the Australian ambassador to Saudi Arabia and the general manager of AusTrade for the Middle East were scheduled to attend. A trio of crossbench senators \u2013 Rex Patrick from Centre Alliance, Peter Whish-Wilson from the Greens, and the Australian Conservatives\u2019 Cory Bernardi \u2013 pushed for a complete boycott of the event earlier this week. Their motion failed to gain traction on Tuesday. \u201cIt is appropriate that as a country we send a strong signal of our concern over Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance, and our expectation that the government of Saudi Arabia provides a forthright and accurate account of what has occurred\u201d Shorten said in a statement on Saturday. Saudi Arabian officials released a statement on Saturday saying that Khashoggi died after a fight broke out in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
