Then he said it again. Absolutely no one agreed with him. About an hour and an epoch earlier, the networks and news channels had seemed as interested in their own redemption story as they were in the election itself. They hoped for a do-over of 2016, where every glib presumption would be replaced with a cautionary note, and a radical plan to wait, no matter how long it took, to see what would actually happen. That was temporarily good for democracy, but possibly difficult for television executives, whose solemn duty was to make their product as opaque as reality. \u201cThere is no telling when we are going to have a winner,\u201d said Martha MacCallum, introducing Fox\u2019s coverage with something other than a bang. \u201cIt could be hours, it could be days, it could possibly take even weeks.\u201d On MSNBC, Brian Williams told viewers: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a night of a lot of math.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a thrilling observation, but it was at least unlikely to be clipped up and played on Twitter\u2019s infinite loop in the days ahead. Of course, there was still the odd hostage to fortune. \u201cBiden is doing much better with white voters, and I think that\u2019s going to be a theme throughout this night,\u201d said David Axelrod, the former Obama adviser, and you wondered if that would ultimately seem too obvious to remember or too idiotic to forget. In those moments, as the words left their mouths, the pundit class seemed like tightrope walkers: foolhardy or brave, one foot in front of another, the weight of history on their backs. Then the numbers came in, and the math went out of the window \u2013 or maybe just got more complicated. NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd, swooshing around his own magic map, remarked: \u201cAll that tells me is, it\u2019s going to take forever to call Florida.\u201d Twenty minutes later, he said that the state \u201clooked like an uphill climb for Joe Biden\u201d. Half an hour after that, it was firmly in the Trump column. CNN\u2019s entire broadcast, meanwhile, had become brutally compelling, appearing to jettison its ensemble of sedate anchors in favour of King\u2019s one-man dramatic monologue on the Florida county of Miami-Dade. But, other than King\u2019s unusual sense of what constitutes a good time, it wasn\u2019t clear why it was still treating Florida like a toss-up. On the BBC, Andrew Neil and Katty Kay were formidable and austere, with Neil signing off from his perch at the corporation in a mood of magnificent irritation with America for not having made its mind up yet. The static cameras and distinct shortage of pounding theme music set them apart from their excitable US counterparts, which were increasingly difficult to distinguish from each other. CBS had a \u201cwhat happens if\u201d map; MSNBC had a \u201cwhat if\u201d map. Every studio adhered to an aesthetic of fluorescent Tetris. Countdown clocks and \u201ckey race alerts\u201d with no outcome attached dragged viewers remorselessly from hour to hour. The phrase \u201cblue wall\u201d became ubiquitous, again. At some point , John King\u2019s touchscreen stopped working. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to come back to me,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, the New York Times\u2019 notorious election needles had swung firmly in Trump\u2019s favour, and the prospect of days more trauma to come. Then one of them swung back again, and Fox News called Arizona for Biden ahead of anybody else. Karl Rove, who when Fox put Ohio in Obama\u2019s column in 2012 had vocally disagreed on air with the station\u2019s decision desk, vocally disagreed on air with the station\u2019s decision desk. The only person who seemed certain of anything was the president himself. Trump tweeted that the Democrats \u201care trying to STEAL the election\u201d and claimed that \u201cVotes cannot be cast after the Poles are closed!\u201d CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper said that \u201cthe fact that the president misspelled \u2018polls\u2019 is just \u2018chef\u2019s kiss\u2019\u201d, which drew the kind of social media enthusiasm on the left that you might a few hours earlier have imagined would be reserved for a victory in Texas. Instead, the naive prospect of euphoria had been replaced with the desperate urge to stave off despair. In another time, those who found themselves unable to switch off might at least have hoped to absorb their anxiety with a few fellow travellers, and a drinking game or two. This year, the stakes are too vast, the lockdowns too dislocating. Instead, they sat in their bubbles, waiting \u2013 and waiting \u2013 for the future to burst through. Fun? Trump called it fraud. \u201cWe gotta dip in here because there have been several statements that are just frankly not true,\u201d said the NBC anchor Savannah Guthrie, to her and the network\u2019s eternal credit, even as rivals let him lie without interruption. On the BBC, a few hours earlier, the political scientist Larry Sabato had made a more plausible assessment. \u201cWe are very, very split,\u201d he said. \u201cThis night has just begun.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
