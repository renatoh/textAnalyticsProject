That was the warning from Donald Tusk, president of the European council, in the wake of the deal struck in the early hours of Friday: the most difficult challenges in negotiating Brexit lie ahead. He\u2019s right. Theresa May did indeed manage to snatch what at many points last week looked an unlikely result, reaching an agreement that allows both sides to declare \u201csufficient progress\u201d made on Britain\u2019s Brexit bill, EU citizens\u2019 rights and the Irish border in order to move on to the next stage of talks. The arduous twists and turns it has taken to get here make it tempting to look at the outcome through rose-tinted spectacles. But while Friday\u2019s agreement perhaps makes a soft Brexit a bit more likely, any celebration would be premature. There is some cause for tentative optimism. The agreement sets out that in the broader context of a deal, if a hard border in Ireland cannot be avoided through other means, there is a safety backstop: \u201cfull alignment\u201d with the rules of the customs union and single market. This would be likely to mean the UK remaining part of the customs union and the single market in effect, if not in name. In signing up to this, May has implicitly abandoned her ludicrous mantra that no deal is better than a bad deal. The most positive reading is that if worse came to worst, the UK will exit on terms we already know are amenable to the EU. But any optimism must be tempered with reality. It has taken nine months of tortuous negotiations to get to an agreement that essentially moves us no further on the key question: what will Britain\u2019s long-term relationship with the EU look like? The Irish border issue cannot be resolved without knowing the answer and so the agreement continues to fudge this issue in a way that allows May to keep her cabinet united. In the last two days, it has become clear that \u201cfull alignment\u201d means different things to different ministers and effective membership of the customs union and single market would be unacceptable to some. The agreement\u2019s terms also make abundantly clear where the power lies. Boris Johnson can issue all the bombastic edicts he likes but as the smaller economic entity, the UK is very much the junior negotiating partner. The fact is that on issues spanning the divorce bill to the role of the European court of justice, it is the UK that has moved further than the EU. This reinforces what Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s lead negotiator, has long made crystal clear. The EU is not going to let Britain have free access to choice slices of the single market while not signing up to the EU\u2019s four fundamental freedoms, including free movement of people. The UK will face a clear trade-off between sovereignty and economic access. We can become a rule-taker, like Norway, to maintain full and free access to the single market. Or we can pay the economic price for full control over our own borders: a limited, Canada-style free trade agreement that would be very unlikely to cover services. There is logic to the belief that the text of the agreement represents a fork in the road, an active choice to head down the path that leads to a Norway-style deal. But it would be naive to think it is a piece of paper that will determine our final destination. Yes, the prime minister is painfully slowly, increment by increment, edging towards something approaching reason. But there are no signs she is taking her cabinet with her. It is utterly split on the end state and we know now it hasn\u2019t even yet discussed it. The ambiguity May is using to hold her party together cannot go on for ever. Where we end up will be less a product of Friday\u2019s agreement and more of both our domestic politics and of dynamics on the continent. At some point, ministers will have to stop pretending that Britain can have it all. When it does, this will unfold into a huge fight between supporters of a hard or soft Brexit. The arithmetic is on the side of a soft Brexit. Not only is there a cross-party parliamentary majority in favour; polling suggests that there is real potential to mobilise public support around such an outcome. One YouGov poll over the summer found that a majority of the public, and half of those who voted Leave, would be happy accepting freedom of movement in exchange for economic access to the single market, so long as welfare benefits are limited for new migrants. But arithmetic by itself isn\u2019t enough. Building a political and popular coalition around a soft Brexit requires leadership. That is something that is sorely lacking. May, so weakened after June\u2019s general election, is too reliant on the support of fervent Brexit supporters in her cabinet. Labour\u2019s official position is that all options should be on the table, but that is a far cry from making a proactive case to its voters that if Britain has to leave, continuing membership of the single market and customs union is the best option. This leaves a dangerous vacuum. Failing to level with the public about the difficult trade-offs in store creates the fertile territory for a populist attack on any future deal, for not providing what was promised. It risks a popular backlash that the hard Brexit ideologues will ruthlessly exploit. And in a political culture that has become so degraded that senior cabinet ministers think nothing of misleading the public and parliament on everything from extra funding for the NHS to whether the government has bothered to forecast the economic impact of leaving the customs union, they will play dirty. Those who, like this newspaper, strongly supported Britain remaining in the European Union may balk at the prospect of channelling huge political capital and energy into winning the fight for what is ultimately very much a second-best option for Britain. It is nothing short of galling that to do so will distract attention from numerous domestic issues that require urgent political focus, such as social care, housing and regional inequalities, and that will get worse the longer they remain unaddressed. But it must be won: the costs of losing are immense. We desperately need what failed to materialise during the referendum campaign: a cross-party coalition of reason that provides the political leadership that is so sorely needed to unite the public around a soft Brexit. That battle was consequently lost, but now there is a second chance to fight for something second best. It must not be wasted."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
