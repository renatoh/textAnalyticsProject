The president faced widespread backlash for reviving his criticism of McCain, who died of brain cancer last year. While Trump shared a notoriously contentious relationship with McCain, Republicans balked at Trump\u2019s willingness to engage in posthumous attacks on the decorated war veteran. Some audience members in Ohio were members of the military. \u201cI gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted, which as president I had to approve,\u201d Trump said of McCain while touring a tank manufacturing plant in Lima, Ohio. \u201cI don\u2019t care about this. I didn\u2019t get a thank you, that\u2019s OK.\u201d Trump returned to broadsides against McCain seven months after his death, amid reports in conservative media outlets that McCain was allegedly responsible for leaking the infamous Russia dossier, compiled by the British ex-spy Christopher Steele. The dossier detailed Trump\u2019s ties to Moscow. In a tweet on Sunday, Trump criticised McCain for his role in the Russia investigation and voiced frustration with his deciding vote against the repeal of Obamacare in 2017. Trump also raised McCain\u2019s healthcare vote during a joint appearance at the White House with the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, telling reporters he was \u201cvery unhappy that [McCain] didn\u2019t repeal and replace Obamacare, as you know\u201d. \u201cThey got to a vote, and he said thumbs down,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think that\u2019s disgraceful.\u201d McCain\u2019s daughter, Meghan McCain, hit back on Wednesday on ABC\u2019s daytime talkshow The View, where she serves as a co-host. \u201cIf I had told my dad: \u2018Seven months after you\u2019re dead you\u2019re going to be dominating the news and all over Twitter,\u2019 he would think it\u2019s hilarious that our president was so jealous of him that he was dominating the news cycle in death as well,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a new bizarre low. I will say attacking someone who isn\u2019t here is a bizarre low,\u201d she added. Trump\u2019s comments also drew backlash from Republicans in Congress, who defended McCain as a \u201chero\u201d after initially remaining silent. \u201cI just want to lay it on the line, that the country deserves better, the McCain family deserves better. I don\u2019t care if he\u2019s president of United States, owns all the real estate in New York, or is building the greatest immigration system in the world,\u201d Senator Johnny Isakson, from Georgia, said in an interview. \u201cNothing is more important than the integrity of the country and those who fought and risked their lives for all of us.\u201d Isakson called the comments \u201cdeplorable\u201d. Senator Martha McSally, the Republican appointed to fill McCain\u2019s seat following his death, tweeted: \u201cJohn McCain is an American hero and I am thankful for his life of service and legacy to our country and Arizona. \u201cEveryone should give him and his family the respect, admiration, and peace they deserve,\u201d she added. Senator Lindsey Graham, one of McCain\u2019s closest friends who has also emerged as a vocal ally of Trump\u2019s, said his comments \u201churt him more than they hurt the legacy of Senator McCain\u201d. \u201cI can\u2019t understand why the President would, once again, disparage a man as exemplary as my friend John McCain: heroic, courageous, patriotic, honorable, self-effacing, self-sacrificing, empathetic, and driven by duty to family, country, and God,\u201d the Utah senator Mitt Romney wrote on Twitter. Trump first feuded with McCain during the 2016 campaign, after he mocked the senator for being held as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. McCain, who faced re-election in the Senate the same year, declined to endorse Trump even after he became the Republican presidential nominee. McCain continued to speak out against Trump until his death, delivering a speech in which he decried \u201chalf-baked, spurious nationalism\u201d in a thinly veiled reference to the president. Trump was not invited to McCain\u2019s funeral last year, which featured speeches by former presidents, including George W Bush and Barack Obama. Trump was not mentioned by name, but a stark contrast was drawn to his brand of politics. McCain\u2019s wife, Cindy McCain, later explained the family\u2019s decision to not invite Trump as a means of ensuring the ceremony would be conducted \u201cwith dignity\u201d. \u201cEven though it was a very public funeral, we are still a family,\u201d McCain said in an interview with the BBC. \u201cIt was important to me that we kept it respectful and calm and not politicize it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
