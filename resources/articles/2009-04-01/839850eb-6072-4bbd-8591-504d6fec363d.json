Venetia Williams has a marker where Aintree is concerned, too, and it dates back to a time when McCoy was still a schoolboy. Williams has saddled 13 runners in the National in her 14-year career as a trainer, though the 10th place recorded by Mon Mome 12 months ago is still the best she has to show for it. But it was in 1988 that Williams, then an amateur jockey, endured her most painful National experience. She lined up on Marcolo, a 200-1 chance, and the memory of what happened next remains so sharp that it might have been last week. \"I remember everything about the race,\" Williams says. \"I remember the start and jumping the first five fences, and then thinking 'we're a little bit wrong at this one' when we got to the next, and rather wishing that it wasn't Becher's. \"That was in the days before Becher's was levelled off, but to be honest we'd have fallen there even if it was the way it is now. That was the year that Rhyme 'N' Reason won, and he virtually went at Becher's the first time. The next day, the Racing Post had a sequence of pictures on the front page showing him basically doing the splits, and in the background, about half a length behind, you can see my dramatic exit.\" Williams had laid careful plans for her first and, as it transpired, only ride in the famous race. \"I remember being quite determined to make sure that I slipped my reins,\" she says, \"because if you don't and they peck, then you'll get pulled over their head. \"But I thought if I did that, I was bound to drop my stick in the process, so I attached it firmly to my middle finger with some elastic. It was very presumptuous of me to even think that I might actually have to use it, but you have to go into a race like that in a positive frame of mind. \"I was knocked out in the fall, but when they loaded me onto the stretcher and into the ambulance, the stick was still firmly attached.\" This is where things get a bit hazy for Williams and she remembers little about the ambulance ride to the local hospital, a trip that has been made by so many jockeys before and since. Having been stood down for a mandatory 10 days, though, she was soon back in the saddle. \"My first ride back after that was when I broke my neck [in a hurdle race at Worcester]. It was the one they call the 'hangman's bone', but it didn't move at all and I was very, very lucky.\" This year, Williams' attempt to balance out her luck at Aintree depends on Mon Mome and Stan, whose connections turned down an invitation to the Nakayama Grand Jump, the world's richest race over obstacles, so that he could take his chance this weekend. Both horses would have an each-way chance at their peak, but have shown little hint of their best form recently. \"Of course I'd love to win it, but you can't have it as too much of an ambition, otherwise you'll spend your whole life being disappointed,\" she says. \"To be honest, General Wolfe and Celtic Abbey would be the only runners I've had with a chance and, unless the ground is extreme, these days you usually find the classy horses filling most of the places. \"Mon Mome hasn't really run to form since he won at Cheltenham in the autumn. He made a bad mistake at the second when he was favourite for the Welsh National and things haven't really gone right for him since. \"I'd been trying to get a horse accepted for the Grand Jump ever since we came third with The Outback Way the first time we went, but by the time our nomination was accepted, we'd come more and more around to thinking about running him [Stan] on Saturday. \"They should both manage on the ground and the fact that I've got two to line up at the start is exciting enough, so anything is possible.\" Success for either runner would allow Williams to put a happy memento on the living-room wall alongside the record of her first Aintree experience. \"I've just got a little picture of it somewhere,\" she says, \"me in the process of crashing. Well, not actually crashing, in mid-flight really. But it's very obvious that I've got a one-way ticket.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
