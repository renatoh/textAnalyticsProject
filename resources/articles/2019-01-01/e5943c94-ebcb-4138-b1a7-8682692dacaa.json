The warnings came from Brendan Schwab of the World Players Association and the former Australia captain Craig Foster after news that Bahrain has formally submitted an extradition request for Al-Araibi\u2019s return. Schwab and Foster were in Zurich on Monday to urge Fifa to do more to save Al-Araibi, who fled Bahrain after being beaten by police and was given refugee status by Australia, over fears he will be tortured or even killed if he is sent back. \u201cThe situation is very urgent because, even if Bahrain does not succeed in extraditing Hakeem, the consequences for him of spending months or even years in the prison while his case drags will be destroying for him,\u201d Schwab told the Guardian. \u201cWe are clearly facing a human rights emergency which needs to be elevated to the highest levels in Bahrain and Thailand. We need to see progress \u2013 and fast \u2013 for Hakeem\u2019s sake.\u201d Foster, meanwhile, said he wanted the case \u201cresolved before Friday\u201d after meeting the Fifa secretary general, Fatma Samoura. Al-Araibi and his supporters believe the fact he was a critic of Sheikh Salman Bin Ibrahim al-Khalifa, a member of Bahrain\u2019s ruling family when he contested the Fifa presidential election in 2015, has led Sheikh Salman to seek revenge. In 2016 Al-Araibi was given a 10-year prison sentence in absentia after being convicted of vandalising a police station, even though he was playing in a televised match at the time the crime took place. \u201cAfter meeting Fifa we believe it understands the gravity of the case,\u201d Schwab said. \u201cThe urgent challenge now for football is to come up with a way to solve it.\u201d On Monday Bahrain\u2019s interior minister defended his government\u2019s pursuit of al-Araibi, claiming concerns he will face torture and unjust imprisonment if he is returned are \u201cfalse reports\u201d. The minister, General Shaikh Rashid bin Abdullah Al Khalifa, said the rule of law prevailed in Bahrain, pointing to al-Araibi\u2019s release on bail from the initial charges \u2013 which allowed him to flee and claim refuge in Australia. \u201cThe external interference in the internal affairs of Bahrain is unacceptable,\u201d he said. \u201cThose raising unfounded doubts about the integrity and independence of the Kingdom\u2019s judicial system are not only interfering, but also attempting to influence the course of justice.\u201d He said there was a need to \u201crespect the legal proceedings and not to ignore the facts by spreading false reports and biased and non-objective information\u201d. The Bahraini government\u2019s communications office did not answer specific questions about its attempts to have al-Araibi returned, including how it obtained an Interpol red notice in contravention of Interpol policies designed to protect refugees. Previous statements from the Bahraini government defending its justice system have been labeled \u201cabsurd\u201d by human rights groups, noting multiple investigations and reports on the torture and mistreatment of prisoners and targeting of opposition figures. Yahya Alhadid, president of Gulf Institute for Democracy and Human Rights, pointed to the recent death sentences delivered by the Bahraini court against political detainees and life sentences against opposition leaders. \u201cThis is a serious indicator of what is waiting for Hakeem if extradited back to Bahrain,\u201d he said. \u201cThe judge, Mohammad Bin Ali al-Khalifa, who sentenced al-Araibi had upheld the court of cassation\u2019s sentence against the prominent human rights defender, Nabeel Rajab, a few days ago, over a tweet posted on his personal Twitter account.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
