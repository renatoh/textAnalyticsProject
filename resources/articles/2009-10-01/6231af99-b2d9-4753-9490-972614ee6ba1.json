The other is a more driven individual who has described his role as \"the wise man\" overseeing his son's progress, but who retains a hands-on role as his mentor. But John Button and Anthony Hamilton, the only two fathers who are such fixtures in the paddock that they rarely miss a race, have one unique thing in common \u2013 both have raised sons who are now British world champions. Behind each Formula One driver is often the story of a gilded upbringing, but rarely in any sport has the relationship between father and son played such a crucial role in building success. Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button say they owe their world titles to the support of their fathers and nothing illustrates this better than the sacrifices that were made for each to progress. While Anthony Hamilton had to hold down three jobs to fund the running costs and entry fees for the next race on some remote kart track in a remote corner of Britain during his son's nascent karting career, John Button is known to have had to borrow petrol money just so he and Jenson could make it home from the track. The tight bonds, strengthened in adversity, were forged early. Film of a 10-year-old Lewis Hamilton shows Anthony preparing his son's kart while keeping an eye on his offspring for the tell-tale signs of frustration and the onset of despair if the racing has not gone well. A background in competition as runner-up in the 1976 British rallycross championship, plus wheeling and dealing in the sport, prepared John Button for the harsh rough and tumble of weekly competition. Neither father would spare their boy's blushes if a metaphorical kick up the backside was necessary to reinforce the realities of a deeply competitive sport in which only the best 20 drivers in the world would eventually reach the top and both have continued the battle against the odds since reaching the pinnacle. Earlier this year, Button revealed the extent to which the barren years that followed his unusually early graduation to the grid had taken their toll on his father. \"He lives on his own in Monaco, and he'd arrive home and get very depressed. Every second of the day it would be running through his mind, whereas I could switch off and I had other things to do.\" Following Hamilton's dramatic world championship-winning drive in S\u00e3o Paolo last year, his father ruminated on the backlash that had seen everything from his son's personality to his driving skills called into question and tried to turn it to their advantage. \"Everything negative thrown at us is just huge positive energy. The more you give us the more it fuels us, and it's brilliant. You can't run and hide.\" Their different backgrounds would help determine their roles as the big time beckoned. Button Sr is happy to merge quietly into the background whereas Anthony Hamilton becomes involved in as many aspects of his son's career as McLaren will allow. While Button plays no part in Jenson's media activities, Hamilton is hovering and monitoring his son's interviews. Both, however, are on standby to offer moral support when needed. Jenson Button refers to his father as \"the Old Boy\". It is a term of endearment rather than derision; a sign of the affection that has developed during the 20 years since John Button bought his son his first kart for Christmas and then guided him through the ranks of junior motorsport until he became, at 20, the youngest Briton to be offered a Formula One drive. \"When I told him, 'Dad, I'm going to be a Formula One driver', he burst into tears. He's done that a few times over the years,\" Button has said. \"He loves watching his little boy do well.\" Hamilton made his debut with McLaren in 2007 and went straight to the top. Button arrived with Williams seven years before and made less of an impact. In each case, the father was on hand to handle the huge responsibility that came with leading the championship or the anxiety and heartache that accompanied perceived failure. Until this season John Button has suffered more pain than pleasure on his son's behalf. \"The worst time was at the beginning of 2007,\" he recalled earlier this year. \"Jenson had been driving the new Honda for the first time. A driver knows instinctively within a few laps whether a car is going to be good or not. Jenson came on the phone and I could tell straight away by the tone of his voice it was not good news. 'Dad,' he said, 'we're in the shit. The car's no good.' My heart went out to him. What could I say? What could I do? Here he was, about to start a new season when he was ready to win races. But he knew he faced a season of going nowhere. It was awful.\" John Button, as usual, attended every race and provided what support he could as Jenson, in private, discussed a career that appeared to be slipping into the ranks of talented nearly-men. But, if the call at the beginning of 2007 filled John Button with despair, his son's appraisal of the 2009 Brawn had the opposite effect. The Brawn-Mercedes was late in appearing but, within one lap at Barcelona, Button knew his prospects had been turned around. He pulled into the pits, said nothing, climbed from the car and went to the Brawn motorhome, where he advised a friend to put a bet on him winning the world championship. It is not known if John Button placed a wager on his boy. But he is not a gambling man and does not need a winning bet to reaffirm Sunday's return on an investment he made without a second thought 20 years ago."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
