The Scot, who has lately been elbowed out of the world championship, is the fastest of Nissan's four Dakar Rally drivers but is also by far the least experienced in such conditions and the potential for disaster after the race starts with today's prologue in Clermont-Ferrand is practically limitless. He did not have a drink on Hogmanay, the eve of the rally, but the next three weeks may come to resemble a prolonged hangover. The Dakar visits seven countries and covers 6,936 miles, the equivalent of a world cham- pionship season in 17 days with only one rest day. It is the longest and arguably the most dangerous rally the 35-year-old McRae has ever attempted. He has neither contested a cross-country event nor competed in anything resembling his 3.5-litre Nissan pick-up - a lorry of a thing compared to the saloon cars he usually drives - nor has he previously raced with his new Swedish co-driver Tina Thorner. He is entering a world where cornering speeds are of no great importance, where he will sometimes have to stop in the middle of a special stage to adjust tyre pressures to avoid getting stuck and where some of the holes are deep enough to swallow a truck nose down. He will also need to watch for bumps on straights that could send him cartwheeling out of control at 120mph. Sometimes two stages hundreds of miles long are paired together without meeting the service crew and he will be required to make any repairs himself. McRae is resourceful but risks finding that stamina is no substitute for experience. He thinks it will resemble Kenya's Safari Rally - at least in places - but admits that he does not know quite what to expect. \"The difficult thing is the first few days are more like a rally would be, from what I'm told and the descriptions I've seen and the reports I've read,\" he said. \"It's more of a defined type of road, so the pace on that is going to be different to the pace elsewhere on the dunes. The pace is going to vary a lot. That's something I don't really have any idea of until I get there and do it for myself. I'll just have to drive at a pace I think's reasonable and have a look at the times everybody else is doing and then judge it from that.\" His pre-event testing has been limited and carried out almost entirely in a markedly different 2002 vehicle. McRae reasons that the rally is long enough to let him play himself in and believes that the latest Nissan will give the opposition a run for its money. In this respect, as in a number of others, the old hands hint that he is deluding himself. Ari Vatanen, the 1981 world rally champion and lead Nissan driver, makes it plain that reliability alone will not give them any chance of matching the all-conquering Mitsubishis. It is not unknown for a Dakar novice to win: rallying's first four-times world champion Juha Kankkunen did so in 1988, but chiefly because Vatanen's Peugeot was stolen during the rally. Without saying that McRae is heading for a fall, Vatanen hints that the Scot must rein in his exuberant driving style. \"The first year nobody expects too much, so in fact he can end up very well, because I'm sure he won't attack and then just by going gently that's what will bring a good result this year. He'll be at the end of his nerves at times but he won't be bored,\" he predicted. Andrew Cowan offered a much more colourful warning. The winner of the first two London-to-Sydney rallies, he is Britain's most successful Dakar driver, having finished second in 1985. \"It would be very wrong to compare it to a Safari Rally. The dunes are an experience: you've got to be there and try it to learn. It looks simple on film but my God it isn't. He will get stuck; it's how he gets out of it. The greatest chance is your experience from doing the event and Colin's got none of that.\" McRae intends to assume that things will inevitably go wrong and to keep an open mind. However, having spent only one night of his life in a tent, he tends to cut short bloodcurdling Dakar tales highlighting the importance of sleeping under an aircraft to avoid being run over. Yet his sense of trepidation has not blunted the excitement. \"I'm really looking forward to it,\" he promised. \"It'll be a new experience. It's like all these things, once you've done the deal you just can't wait to get started and see how it all works out. \"They reckon the Dakar goes through phases. It's a difficult one, then it seems to tail off because everybody complains a bit and then it builds up to another difficult one again until everyone complains. Everybody reckons this is going to be a difficult one this year, so, good time to start, isn't it?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
