Rio Ferdinand described the performance as lethargic and added that Alexis S\u00e1nchez looked a shadow of his former self while Paul Scholes called for the Chilean to be dropped. Clutching desperately at the thinnest of straws, Mourinho suggested United had no time for self-recrimination because they had an FA Cup quarter-final tie against Brighton coming up at the weekend. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make a drama out of this defeat. It\u2019s not the end of the world. It\u2019s football and we have another match on Saturday,\u201d the United manager said. \u201cI know this has happened at Manchester United before because I have sat in this chair as manager of Porto and of Real Madrid. I don\u2019t think it is something new for this club.\u201d Unsurprisingly Mourinho did not share the critics\u2019 view that United had been poor. \u201cWe did our best, we tried, we lost, that\u2019s football,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the performance was bad, the way we started was really positive. We were in control for the first 10 or 15 minutes, then after that Sevilla started to hide the ball. They have good players, they can do that. They played well in the first half without creating many dangerous situations. We had chances to score in the second half but didn\u2019t take them. After that it was clear that the first goal was going to change the shape of the game and they were the ones who scored it.\u201d Mourinho said three weeks ago that until a team reached the quarter-finals they could not be regarded as genuine Champions League contenders, so by his own admission United have failed after spending so much money on players like Romelu Lukaku and Paul Pogba, the latter of whom did not even start this game and was unimpressive when he came on. Was that acceptable for a club of United\u2019s stature? \u201cYes,\u201d came the terse reply. Was he happy that United managed only four shots on target over the two legs. \u201cThat\u2019s just a statistic.\u201d What needs to change to bring the team up to the desired Champions League level? \u201cEverything.\u201d Would that cost even more money? \u201cEveryone else spends money too. We are not the only team that invests money in players.\u201d Mourinho refused to answer a question from a Spanish journalist about whether going out of the Carabao Cup, Champions League and being so far behind in the league amounted to failure, on the grounds that he doubted it would interest a Spanish readership. It was never going to be difficult for Vincenzo Montella to appear a ray of sunshine by comparison and Sevilla\u2019s Italian coach managed it easily. \u201cI am very happy and I have a dressing room full of happy players,\u201d Montella said. \u201cIt is amazing to come to a stadium like this and make it to the last eight of the Champions League. We put in a very effective performance and deserved the victory. \u201cBen Yedder took his chances fantastically well but the whole team did well to control possession and restrict an attacking side like Manchester United to very few opportunities.\u201d Invited to join in the chorus of criticism of United\u2019s performance Montella came up with a classy response. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was about them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were just very good.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
