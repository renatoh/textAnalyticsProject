By casting their net over two years' worth of publications, a move that has previously stretched the memory of many a reader, the committee has allowed two Booker prize winners to compete against one another. Margaret Atwood and Peter Carey, both in clear and obvious need of the money, will attempt to see off the likes of Carlos Fuentes and Michel Houellebecq. Current odds have Peggy at 3/1 and Pete at 6/4; the judges break silence on May 13. \u00b7 Following last week's reports of David Vise, the Washington Post journalist who ordered many thousands of copies of his own book from Barnesandnoble.com and stands accused of trying to manoeuvre his way up the bestseller charts, the Loafer is delighted to see his publisher doing what publishers do best - coming up with a great euphemism. According to Morgan Entrekin at Grove Atlantic, Vise always has been \"a dynamic promoter\". Unfortunately, this time he got \"a little overenthusiastic\". To the tune, apparently, of 18,000-odd copies. What might out-and-out hyperbole entail? \u00b7 An Amazon.co.uk bursary was last week awarded to Danny King, for his novel The Bank Robber Diaries. But did the judges really consider the effect their choices would have on the moral fibre of the nation? King's publisher, Serpent's Tail, tells us that the author recently read from his work at Borders in Oxford Street, and included an episode in which a hold-up was conducted by bandits disguised in Muslim dress. Fast-forward to the Sun (headline: You berk-as!), which recounted just such an ambush but a few short weeks later, noting that a posh Sloane Street jewellers was thus relieved of \u00a3200,000 of its stock. Criminal mastermind King must settle for a mere \u00a33,500, but can comfort himself with Amazon judge David Baddiel's statement that he is \"one of the few writers to make me laugh out loud\". Baddiel, meanwhile, who is slowly colonising literature as he once did football, is hotly tipped to be one of this year's Booker judges - so King is obviously doing something right."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
