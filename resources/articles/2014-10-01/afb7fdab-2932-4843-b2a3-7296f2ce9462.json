Here\u2019s a summary of where things stand: The West African countries hit hardest by Ebola warned of \u201ca tragedy unforeseen in modern times\u201d and asked for more help from countries in a position to lend it. Here\u2019s a roundup of which countries have pledged what aid. In the hardest-hit countries \u2013 Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea \u2013 the mark of Ebola was felt in every corner of daily life, on society, families, the economy and more. This blog includes many first-person testimonials from people whose lives have been touched by Ebola. These include: a medic in Liberia; aid workers in Sierra Leone; a vaccine test subject in the UK; a teen orphaned by Ebola; three Ebola survivors; a Canadian Ebola medic; and a documentary maker in Sierra Leone. The World Health Organization said 3,865 had died and over 7,000 had been infected. The UN has called it \u201clikely the greatest peacetime challenge that the United Nations and its agencies have ever faced.\u201d Video: Ebola: how can we stop it spreading? How you can help Read the previous blog summary. The Unicef Twitter account is publishing a series of infographics about Ebola. \u201cEbola is not a death sentence\u201d: Ebola is at top left in this gif comparing the rapidity of transmission and mortality rates of eight diseases (click on the tweet to activate): Hazel Chandler is a documentary maker who first went to Sierra Leone in 2004. She runs a charity in Freetown, and has just returned from the epicentre of the outbreak in Kenema. See her earlier dispatches for this blog here and here and here. The two-month quarantine has had a dramatic effect on the economy, which was largely based on small businesses. Most people live hand-to-mouth, earning just enough money each day to feed their families and pay the rent. Shopkeepers buy in from Bo or Freetown, where prices are cheaper. Taxi drivers make their living doing the Bo to Kenema run. \u201cThe vehicles are going nowhere,\u201d says Amara, a driver: They are just parked. We are just hanging around idle. All the families are suffering. Things are very difficult for me and my colleagues. There is no food in the house. Nothing.\u201d A shopkeeper named Sal said,\u201cFor now the business is really bad with us\u201d: Normally when people are traveling they come in to buy but since this sickness is around no-one can travel. Everything is difficult. I don\u2019t understand what is going on because we don\u2019t have help from anywhere.\u201d Widows who sold goods at the market, making just enough to put food on the table, have lost their own incomes in addition to their husband\u2019s. Martha, a widow, said, \u201cI have no money and no-one to pay the rent. The business came to an end and I have four children to feed.\u201d US Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said on Thursday that he would like to expand screenings for the Ebola virus to airports outside the United States, Reuters reports: \u201cMy goal is that we create internationally as many different checkpoints as possible for travelers to go through the system,\u201d said Johnson, speaking at Washington think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies. The Department announced on Wednesday that it would begin screening travelers arriving in five U.S. airports from three West African countries with high rates of Ebola. Johnson said most travelers entering the United States from the affected countries connect through other airports, often those in Europe.

See her earlier dispatches for this blog here and here. To people who are dealing with the trauma of loss \u2013 loss of children, loss of husband and bread winner, loss of parents \u2013 the trials of quarantine become less significant. Death of a family member brings with it, not only grief, but fear and rejection and, in the early days, the destruction of your property. Now they use disinfectant but until recently mattresses, clothing and personal mementos were all burnt. Here is testimonial from a widow named Martha: My husband was working in the Ebola hospital. When he died they took all our things and burnt them. There is nothing inside the house. I sat at home for 21 days and when quarantine ended my sister came with shoes and clothes for me.\u201d These are people who had very little to begin with and now have no incomes to replace what is lost. Martha continued, People shout at me and say my husband left me with Ebola. I wanted to take a picture of him for my children in the future but they would not allow me. So I went home and cried.\u201d The number of children orphaned by Ebola is unknown. The NGO Street Child says that, in Kenema, the figure is at least 100. These children face very uncertain futures. Some have family in other cities who cannot help them because they simply cannot get through the road blocks. The numbers of children on the streets will swell if no-one comes to their aid. A Red Cross nurse in far north Queensland, Australia, who was undergoing tests in an isolation unit to see if she is suffering from Ebola, has been cleared, Queensland Health has reported. A Guardian report from earlier today has details of her case: The nurse, named in the media as Sue-Ellen Kovack, 57, returned to Australia on Tuesday after a month working in Sierra Leone, one of the countries hardest hit by the epidemic which has so far claimed almost 3,900 lives across five west African countries. She was under observation in Cairns hospital, Queensland\u2019s chief health officer, Jeanette Young, confirmed. She had been kept in home isolation and was admitted to hospital with a low-grade fever on Thursday. Read more here. Ebola aid: Who\u2019s pledged what? The Texas Department of State Health Services announced Thursday a deputy sheriff in the Dallas suburb of Frisco who had entered the apartment where Ebola victim Thomas Eric Duncan had stayed has tested negative for Ebola. It had been feared that the deputy, identified as Michael West Monnig, had contracted Ebola after he exhibited flu-like symptoms. The health services completed testing of a specimen submitted today by Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, it said: The result is negative for Ebola. Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, which is treating the deputy, said his health is improving. \u201cMr Monnig\u2019s condition is good with no fever, no vomiting, no diarrhea reported. His current condition is NOT consistent with an early stage ebola diagnosis,\u201d the hospital said in a statement. Foreign Office officials are investigating reports that a British national has died in Macedonia of suspected Ebola, Saska Cvetkovska (@saskac) reports for the Guardian from Skopje. If confirmed it would be the first death of a UK national from Ebola (British nurse Will Pooley was cured of the virus last month): The Macedonian government last night said it was investigating the death of a British national on its territory after an undiagnosed illness but stressed that the cause of death had not been confirmed. \u201cIt is a British citizen who has died. The health ministry is trying to find out what he died from and it needs some time to find out the reason,\u201d a foreign ministry spokesman said. \u201cWe are following the protocols of what to do in such cases set out by the World Health Organisation.\u201d The director of the commission for infectious disease at the ministry of health, Jovanka Kostovska, said the man, a 56-year-old, had traveled from London to Macedonia on 2 October with a colleague for business. He had been staying at a hotel in the centre of Skopje when he was taken ill with severe stomach ache and increased temperature. The man remained in his hotel room for three days, before an ambulance was called yesterday afternoon around 3pm local time. He was taken to hospital where he died around 90 minutes later. At this stage ebola is only suspected, and further tests are to be carried out by a laboratory in Germany to find out if it is ebola or not. Results are expected within 48 hours. The Guardian\u2019s Lauren Gambino (@LGamGam) has spoken with Wendy Arellano, one of about 200 maintenance staff at La Guardia airport who have staged a walkout to protest what they say are unsafe working conditions that do not protect against potential Ebola contraction. Wendy guides the water and lavatory trucks and on occasion she has to clean bathrooms in plane cabins, she told Lauren: \u201cWhen I do bathroom, I come in contact with tampons which I have to grab with my hand with a glove that is so cheap that it breaks easily. I come in contact with feces, a lot of feces and vomit. And we have to clean those bathrooms spotless because they audit those planes. They expect us, that if a little bit of feces stays on the toilet, that we remove it with our hands because [if not] they will say that bathroom is dirty. And I refuse to do it because I think it\u2019s disgusting and I don\u2019t have the appropriate attire, and because I don\u2019t know what that person has. We come in contact with a lot of stuff that is dangerous for our health and obviously they don\u2019t give us the appropriate tools to work with. God forbid we get a disease like Ebola, Hepatitis, even AIDS, for $9 an hour it\u2019s not worth it. They\u2019re not going to take care of us. They\u2019re not going to take care of my kids if something happens to me. Air Serv, an employer of the people striking today, released the following statement in response to the walkout: Air Serv trains its cabin cleaners in its long-standing safety procedures and cleaning protocols including for blood borne pathogens. These protocols include, but are not limited to, providing cleaners with protective equipment. We continually review our policies and procedures for updates and enhancements, and communicate updates to employees, as necessary \u2013 for example, including an update on protocols for Ebola just last week. As to the union\u2019s organizing campaign, we have no comment. When you got sick what were the most important things that helped you get through it? The encouragement I had was knowing the Lord was going to free me, because they told me that Ebola was something that had no cure. So when I got it I was very down. For me to walk, it was hard when I got that. So, I tried by all means. I drank my oral rehydration salts and the nurses helped me when I was weak. They gave me my medicine. Where I was, so many people died in my presence. In the morning, I would get on my knees and crawl. I was very sick when I got to the International Medical Corps centre. And the day that I left from there was a joyful day. So, I\u2019m very happy. What more do you think could be done to help people survive Ebola by organisations on the ground? Bring personal protective equipment (PPE), because PPE is something that can only be used one time. And nurses go in there three times a day, and the patients are becoming more. So the thing I\u2019m telling them to help us with is PPE, so that people will be able to go and take care of the patients. Without the PPE, you can\u2019t go in there. Even if the patient is dying, you can\u2019t go in there, because you have to protect yourself. So I\u2019m asking them to please come in with more help like these International Medical Corps people have, more PPE and equipment--medicines, gloves, IV drips to help the other people there. As a survivor you probably won\u2019t get sick again, how does this change how you feel about being around the virus? I feel alright. Even if I enter a place with people with Ebola, I know I cannot get Ebola. So I\u2019m free now. I\u2019m happy I will not get it. And if I enter in there, I will be happy talking with them, counselling them, telling them what to do to be safe like me. Will you return to nursing those with the disease? Yes, if I\u2019m strong enough to walk, I will return to nursing, because I\u2019m an Ebola-free patient now. I can never get Ebola in my life again. Having seen other Ebola victims first hand and after suffering the disease yourself, what is the reality of suffering Ebola, and what sort of thoughts went through your mind when you were diagnosed and ill? When I was at Phebe Hospital, there were five nurses that left to Monrovia for treatment. It was a day of so much crying. But none of them came back to Phebe. So when I got Ebola, when I suspected that I had Ebola, for all I knew, I was not going to come back. That was the only thing I could think. My friends, never came back. They tried by all means, but not one of them came back. Now, about eight of them have died. I survived. I was afraid. I was walking up and down, and I would sit in here, because I didn\u2019t want anyone to come around me. So I stayed in the back of the house. In the night I would leave the room and come out here and lie on the ground, so nobody would come close. I told them, I am getting the virus they are all talking about. So I was very afraid. I told them the next place they would take me, I would not come back. I told them, take care of each other, because I\u2019m not going to come back, because Ebola kills and there is no medicine for it. Only the International Medical Corps centre was able to save me. Have you returned to your regular state of health or are you still suffering from any lingering symptoms? And have any of your symptoms caused permanent physical damage? I still have pains in my joints. But when I try by all means, I can move around. The symptoms I had when I had Ebola, I don\u2019t have those symptoms anymore. They have all gone away. I can eat. I\u2019m improving. Sometimes in the morning, I take the broom and I start sweeping. They try to take the broom from me, but I say no, it\u2019s small exercise. I also try to make the fire, and they try to tell me no, but I say I want to try to do things as I did before. I\u2019m relearning how to do them. Assuming you have been observing media coverage of the Ebola outbreak, is there some bit of information that has so far not been communicated, or perhaps not communicated prominently enough, that you think the public should be aware of? Stigma. The people who used to pass by here, now they pass on the road. The journalists need to tell people not to stigmatize us. They stigmatize the children, they tell them, don\u2019t go in that yard or you\u2019ll get Ebola. When you pass, pass with speed, run! Run and pass them before Ebola gets you. So that\u2019s what I want to tell them. Keep on telling people, Ebola is a real sickness. It\u2019s no joke. People are still here denying it. Read an interview with Ebola survivor Will Pooley, and an interview with Ebola survivor Harrison Sakilla Kim Willsher (@kimwillsher1) in Paris reports for the Guardian that an alert was lifted around a social services building in the Paris suburb of Cergy-Pontoise after two hours on Thursday evening after the French authorities said fears of Ebola amounted to a false alarm. French authorities sealed off a building near Paris on concerns about Ebola on Thursday after four people inside fell ill with headaches and fever, Reuters reported: \u201cThe suspicion (of Ebola) is lifted,\u201d said the official in the town of Cergy Pontoise, northwest of Paris. Police and interior ministry sources had said earlier the social services building was sealed off with 60 people inside after the four people, who arrived in France from Guinea in early October, fell ill. France has not reported any cases of the Ebola virus. An earlier report said four children in the building who had recently come to France from Guinea showed symptoms of the virus. Here\u2019s a significant asterisk to the earlier report that a House committee had agreed to release an additional $700m to fight Ebola. For that money to be released the proposal must pass the Senate as well, and an aide to Sen. James Inhofe, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services panel, said Inhofe has not signed off on the money, the AP reports: It takes the OK of the top Republican and Democrat on the House and Senate Armed Services and Appropriations panels to \u201creprogram\u201d Pentagon funds. The Democrats have already agreed to the proposal. As our live blog coverage continues, here\u2019s a summary of where things stand: A Macedonian health ministry official said a hotel in Skopje had been quarantined with people inside after a British man died there after exhibiting Ebola symptoms. UPDATE: test results are expected within 48 hours. A community centre in a Paris suburb was quarantined after four children recently arrived from Guinea were said to exhibit Ebola symptoms. UPDATE: The quarantine has been lifted and officials say this was a false alarm. Six people were under quarantine in Madrid, Spain, where the condition of a nurse diagnosed with Ebola was said to be deteriorating. Leaders of West African nations hit hardest by the outbreak made an urgent appeal for additional aid to an emergency meeting in Washington of officials from the UN, IMF and World Bank. The World Health Organization said 3,865 people were reported to have died in West Africa by the end of 5 October \u2013 but the true total was likely much higher. \u201cCases are growing exponentially,\u201d UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon said. Infection rates appeared to be surging in some areas while declining in others. \u201cWe need a 20-fold surge in our response,\u201d Ban said. A smallish group of US lawmakers asked President Obama to institute a travel ban from West Africa countries in the hot zone. This blog includes many first-person testimonials from people whose lives have been touched by Ebola. These include: a medic in Liberia; aid workers in Sierra Leone; a vaccine test subject in the UK; a teen orphaned by Ebola; three Ebola survivors; a Canadian Ebola medic; and a documentary maker in Sierra Leone. Video: Ebola: how can we stop it spreading? How to help Macedonian authorities said they had sealed off a hotel where a Briton suspected of dying of Ebola had stayed, keeping another Briton and hotel staff inside. Reuters reports: A Health Ministry official said the man had arrived in the capital, Skopje, from Britain on Oct. 2 and had been rushed to hospital at 3 p.m. (1300 GMT) on Thursday, where he died several hours later. Dr. Jovanka Kostovska of the ministry\u2019s commission for infectious diseases said the man had been suffering from fever, vomiting and internal bleeding, and that his condition deteriorated rapidly. \u201cThese are all symptoms of Ebola, which raises suspicions with this patient,\u201d Kostovska told a news conference, adding that samples had been sent to Germany for tests to confirm the cause of death. More than two dozen lawmakers want the US government to ban travelers from the West African countries hit hardest by the Ebola virus until the outbreak is under control, Reuters reports: Twenty-three Republican and three Democratic members of the U.S. House of Representatives signed a letter released on Thursday to President Barack Obama asking the State Department to impose a travel ban and restrict visas issued to citizens of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. In the letter, dated Oct. 8, they also asked U.S. health and border control officials to consider quarantine for anyone who arrives from the affected nations after being exposed to Ebola until 21 days have passed, the period in which they would show signs of the illness. The lawmakers said Obama should not wait for the World Health Organization to dictate how U.S. authorities should proceed. \u201cThe WHO is an organization of unelected bureaucrats and political appointees of foreign countries. It has no duty to protect the lives and well-being of Americans, as you do,\u201d the letter said. Read the full report here. Separately, Republicans in the US House of Representatives on Thursday agreed to release $700 million more to fight Ebola from the Defense Department\u2019s request to shift $1 billion in war funds, bringing the total so far to $750 million, Reuters reports: The additional funds were released following briefings from Pentagon officials this week after a handful of lawmakers had limited the funding shift to just $50 million until they received more information about plans to deploy up to 4,000 U.S. troops to West Africa to fight the disease \u201cThis week, the committee received briefings in which the DoD estimates, based upon prior humanitarian relief efforts they will require $750 million for the first six months of the mission,\u201d said House Armed Services Committee Chairman Howard \u201cBuck\u201d McKeon said in a statement. A social services centre in the Paris suburb of Cergy Pontoise was sealed off on Thursday night after four children reported to have to have recently come to France from Guinea, one of the countries affected by Ebola, showed symptoms of the virus, Kim Willsher (@kimwillsher1) reports from Paris: The building, used to house foreign children who are in difficulty or have no family to care for them, was sealed off as a precautionary measure while tests were carried out, the local prefect Jean-Luc Nevache told AFP. Officials said between 50 and 100 people, several of whom recently returned to Guinea, were being confined in the building, which had been quarantined while the emergency services examined the children. A crisis centre has been set up. The Dallas hospital treating a sheriff\u2019s deputy who went into the apartment where an Ebola victim was living says the deputy is showing no signs that he\u2019s also infected, the Associated Press reports: Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas said in a statement Thursday that Michael Monnig remains in good condition one day after he was taken by ambulance to the hospital. The hospital says Monnig does not have a fever, vomiting or diarrhea. Results of further testing are expected later Thursday. Monnig was one of the deputies who went inside the Dallas apartment where Thomas Eric Duncan was staying. Monnig did not have contact with Duncan, but did see some of Duncan\u2019s family members now in isolation. Duncan died Wednesday. Officials say none of Duncan\u2019s relatives have shown any signs that they are infected. Reuters has more on the reported death of a Briton in Macedonia. The report, which refers to a second Briton said to have fallen ill with symptoms consistent with Ebola, quotes \u201ca senior Macedonian government official who spoke on condition of anonymity\u201d: He said the two had been staying at a hotel in the capital Skopje and that hotel staff and the ambulance crew that took them in for treatment had been put into isolation. Want to help? Here are some ways. The death toll from the Ebola epidemic continues to rise \u2013 more than 3,800 cases have been confirmed, the vast majority in west Africa \u2013 and on Wednesday the US and UK made another \u201curgent plea\u201d for all nations to boost their efforts to combat the virus. So what is currently being done \u2013 and what can you do to help? How to volunteer \u2022 In the UK, more than 500 NHS workers have signed up to volunteer at a hospital in Sierra Leone. NHS staff wishing to be considered for the UK response to Ebola in west Africa can register their interest. \u2022 M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res is recruiting field staff from both medical and non-medical backgrounds. \u2022 USAid is inviting qualified medical professionals to volunteer. \u2022 The International Medical Corps is recruiting qualified healthcare practitioners, water, sanitation and environmental experts, psychosocial staff and logistics, human resources and finance professionals to work in Ebola treatment units in Sierra Leone and Liberia For additional ways to help, including many suggestions for HOW TO DONATE and how to stay informed, click here. Readers in Ebola outbreak zones have been sharing images, video and text with us via the GuardianWitness tool (view submissions or contribute yourself here). Here are two submissions from Sierra Leone: (thanks @carmenfishwick) Video: Ebola: how can we stop it spreading? Two vaccines are being trialed at the moment. One drug takes several months to produce, and so will not be widely available any time soon. But there are many everyday practical measure that are important to containing the outbreak. Watch for more: For some diaspora west Africans, there is the twin distress of being thousands of miles away from relatives and communities who have succumbed to Ebola, as well as facing stigma in their adopted homeland, reports Guardian West Africa correspondent Monica Mark (@nickswicks): Some say they have been told not to come into work on the back of a wave of negative publicity surrounding the death of Thomas Duncan, the Liberian who was diagnosed with Ebola in America. Duncan died Wednesday. Guinean-American Fatima Diallo, a 28-year-old living in New York, said she now fears going to the hospital if she falls sick. \u201cThey may treat me the same way [as a Guinean returnee] and it is really traumatising,\u201d she said. Mohammed Jabadeh, 27, a New York City tour bus employee from Liberia, lost 14 members of his family. His brother was the latest to become infected. \u201cIt\u2019s actually heartbreaking to me because that\u2019s one of my brothers I love very much,\u201d Jabadeh told Nigeria\u2019s Nation newspaper. He said that he has been sending more money home to encourage his family to stay indoors. \u201cYou have to work extra hard in America and send them enough money so that they can have enough foodstuff.\u201d Apprehension is growing as the death toll rises, Monica writes: \u201cNowadays, I\u2019m afraid to answer the phone, because I think they\u2019re going to tell me about another casualty -- someone has died,\u201d Macdaniel Powell, a Liberian-born resident in Minnesota, recently told Five Eyewitness News. Minnesota has one of the largest west African communities in the US, and some have banded together to raise awareness of the disease and fight back against ignorance. Since August, the Minnesota African Task Force has been recruiting health workers to volunteer in Liberia while distributing educational flyers. And a fundraising football match and prayer vigil recently held in Bronx was well attended by many from across the diaspora. \u201cI know it\u2019s in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone but at this point it doesn\u2019t matter because it is West Africa,\u201d said Usman Gaye, 34, from Gambia. A British national suspected of contracting the Ebola virus has died in Macedonia, a senior Macedonian government official said on Thursday, Reuters reports: A second Briton had shown symptoms of the virus, the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Video: Ebola: a frontline doctor\u2019s viewpoint From the perspective of the UK and other European states, Black said that the public should not be panicking and should be wary of paranoia: There has been a lot of media attention on how we defence ourselves and paranoia around the coming plague and that\u2019s simply not the situation. When you talk about numbers of people who have been affected in the west it\u2019s very small and it\u2019s very unlikely that there is going to be any sort of widespread disease here. However, I do think that there has been a lot of sensationalist material put out there and maybe the time is coming that the government tries to start putting forward a constructive public health message that prepares the population with the correct information because knowledge is power essentially and if you have the right knowledge then you can feel secure in yourself.\u201d Video: UK factory\u2019s orders for Ebola protection suits double in a day Video: The Ebola gravediggers of Sierra Leone Here is an update to accounts by aid workers in Sierra Leone of their work today (see earlier post). From Freetown, Kelfa Kargbo, director of Street Child - a British charity that turned its 650-strong community workforce in Sierra Leone and Liberia to the Ebola effort two months ago - says \u201cthe problem is far from solved\u201d: This morning one member of Street Child staff passed a corpse in the centre of Freetown on his drive to work; the family had been calling the Ebola response team for days, but nobody had come. My morning meeting with Street Child senior management was extremely optimistic; our collective feeling is that our Ebola teaching training strategy will bring positive results. One of my Street Child staff members, Moses Kargbo, expressed his feelings of shock after his recent visit to Street Child-supported, quarantined families in Makeni. While collecting information for Street Child to disseminate to the media, Moses witnessed many untreated sick and countless families without food or humanitarian aid. Street Child initiatives, such as teacher training and providing humanitarian aid, are a major step in the fight against Ebola, but the problem is far from solved. From Kenema, George Quaker, deputy head of operations for Street Child, says \u201cthe orphan numbers are shocking\u201d: I am just leaving the ministry of social welfare, gender and children\u2019s affairs after a fruitful meeting. I received all the data Street Child needs on the number of orphaned children and post-quarantined families. The orphan numbers are shocking; in Kenema district alone 400 orphans have been identified. As part of Street Child\u2019s campaign to support 1,000 Ebola orphans, it is our hope that we can provide immediate support for the majority of these orphans in the form of food, clothing and, where needed, medical support. Street Child will then undergo a reunification process to provide these orphans with the care of a relative or foster carer. In Kenema, everybody is greatly challenged, which makes the work of Street Child all the more important; we have identified 116 post-quarantined households who need support. This afternoon I will visit these families and assess how many children they have, and how best Street Child can support the primary breadwinner. Our aim is that these children are cared for and can return to school when schools are re-opened. From Makeni, John Momodu Kargbo, head of operations for the rural Bombali district, passes on an account of a runaway grandmother and child: As Street Child staff conducted their morning visits to quarantined homes in Makeni we were told of an old grandmother who had run away with a baby believed to be suffering from Ebola; she had refused to take the child for treatment. This was two weeks ago and they are currently feared dead. In this remote cluster of seven houses, known as Masuba, losses have been great, tens of people have died and more are feared infected. Street Child is also stepping up our engagement with Street Children living permanently on the streets. Training for Street Child staff has given us a better platform to educate street children about Ebola prevention. Read what the aid workers told us earlier on Thursday here (via @lisaocarroll). Liberia, where the healthcare system is still reeling from a devastating 1989-2003 civil war, is facing recession and may need more aid from the International Monetary Fund given the budgetary toll the virus has taken, its finance minister said Thursday. Reuters reports: \u201cOur economy was projected to grow by 5.9 percent. That growth has been revised down to 1 percent,\u201d Finance Minister Amara Konneh told Reuters late on Wednesday. \u201cTechnically, the economy is in recession.\u201d Konneh said the nation\u2019s service sector had taken the biggest blow with activity \u201cdeclining significantly by some 10 percent.\u201d He said the agricultural sector had shrunk by 12 percent, and cited mining and manufacturing as other areas under heavy pressure. Read the full piece here. Two U.S. military flights were due to arrive in Liberia on Thursday, Army Capt. R. Carter Langston told The Associated Press in an email: \u201cTwo different flights of MV-22 Osprey and KC-130 aircraft, along with U.S. Marines, will arrive to support the whole-of-government effort to contain Ebola,\u201d Carter said, noting they would land at Roberts Airfield outside Monrovia. The announcement came as Sierra Leone President Koroma called the outbreak \u201ca tragedy unforeseen in modern times\u201d: \u201cOur people are dying,\u201d Sierra Leone President Ernest Bai Koroma said by videoconference at a World Bank meeting in Washington on the Ebola response. He called the epidemic \u201ca tragedy unforeseen in modern times,\u201d saying the world is not responding fast enough as children are orphaned and doctors and nurses continue to die. A Uganda-born doctor, John Taban Dada, died early Thursday of Ebola at a treatment center on the outskirts of Monrovia, Liberia\u2019s capital. Liberian Health Minister Tolbert Nyenswah said the gynecologist and surgeon will be immediately buried Thursday in accordance with policy requiring quick interment of victims. Dada\u2019s death brings to four the number of doctors who have died in Liberia since the outbreak, the AP said. Over ninety health workers, including nurses and physician assistants, have also died.

In Sierra Leone, many people still go to traditional healers they trust and who are part of their community, even when there are conventional medical facilities, writes health editor Sarah Boseley. These people are held in respect. Even people who live within reach of a medical clinic - and many do not - will often go to the healer as well. Research Richard Mallett and colleagues from the Overseas Development Institute studied healthcare provision in Sierra Leone a few months ago, which led to a report and photo essay. Their work underlines how important it is for those trying to contain the Ebola epidemic in west Africa to engage with communities and traditional leaders. The briefing paper says there is: A high level of respect accorded to elders and traditional knowledge in Sierra Leone. Because traditional healers are venerated in society, even individuals who do not actually believe in their treatments take them seriously. This is particularly the case where the traditional healer is a religious leader, as their treatments are bound up with social norms about good behaviour The healers are in a position to be able to educate and influence their communities - which means that though their medicines will not help, they can be part of the solution. About 200 airplane cabin cleaners at La Guardia airport in Queens walked off the job Wednesday night, protesting that they were not provided with adequate protection to handle the blood, feces, hypodermic needles and other biohazards they encounter in their jobs. The New York Daily News reports: \u201cI have to deal with vomit, feces and a lot of chemicals, without proper equipment,\u201d cleaner Johanna Cruz, 33 and from Queens, told the Daily News. \u201cThey give us gloves, but they might as well be made of paper because they rip so easily.\u201d Read the full piece here. The World Health Organization adjusted its number on Thursday for the total death toll in the West African Ebola outbreak, revising down its previous total by 14 after an adding error, Reuters reports: The WHO said 3,865 people had died by the end of Oct 5, not 3,879 as it said on Wednesday. The figures represent the total of Ebola deaths notified by the countries hit by the virus, but the WHO says the figures are under-reported and the true totals are much higher. Music is an essential part of life in Liberia, Unicef\u2019s Ruskhan Ratnam writes to us. You have people of all ages singing and dancing in small street side shops every evening, and a radio playing in almost every community in Liberia. So the Ministry of Health and Unicef used songs as a way of getting the message out about Ebola. You can listen to one of the songs aimed at educating the Liberian public, by \u2018Crusaders for Peace\u2019, below. \u201cEbola is real / Let us protect ourselves and our families Ebola can kill / It has no cure, but it can be prevented\u201d Public hospitals in New York City are so concerned about Ebola, they\u2019ve secretly been sending actors with mock symptoms into emergency rooms to test how well the triage staffs identify and isolate possible cases, the Associated Press reports: A small Ohio hospital has hung up signs imploring patients to let nurses know immediately if they have traveled recently to west Africa. And across the US, one of the nation\u2019s largest ambulance companies has put together step-by-step instructions for wrapping the interior of a rig with plastic sheeting. There hasn\u2019t been a single confirmed case of an Ebola infection happening on US soil; the case confirmed in Dallas involves a man who, like several health care workers treated in the US, contracted the virus in Liberia. But health care providers are worried enough to take a wide variety of precautions. It isn\u2019t yet clear whether these preparations are overkill, or not nearly enough. Read the full report here. The UK defence secretary, Michael Fallon, said there are no plans to introduce Ebola screening at UK airports at this stage - following WHO advice that screening procedures are more effective in the country of the outbreak. For more from Fallon see earlier. Nationwide Senate elections in Liberia scheduled for next week are to be suspended due to the impossibility of ensuring voters\u2019 health, AFP reports. Almost three million voters had been due to go to polling stations on Tuesday but organisers said there was no way a \u201cmass movement, deployment and gathering of people\u201d could go ahead without endangering lives. President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf was exercising powers under a state of emergency announced in August \u201cto suspend... any and all rights ordinarily exercised, enjoyed and guaranteed to citizens,\u201d the foreign office said in a statement issued late Wednesday, quoting a presidential proclamation. Among the logistical difficulties the Ebola outbreak presented was that the Liberian election commission would have been unable to fly in the required ballot materials. The necessary training and deployment of 25 000 staff countrywide would also not have been able to proceed safely. AFP said that the election commission was still hopeful of setting a new election date by the end of the year. Nigeria - Africa\u2019s most populous country - has emerged relatively unscathed from its brush with Ebola when an infected Liberian civil servant arrived in Lagos: it recorded seven fatalities and has reported no new cases since 31 August. But its success came at a high price to health workers who fought to contain the disease without isolation wards or immediate government help. Of the seven dead, four were medics. West Africa correspondent Monica Mark reports on the heroism of doctors including Sheikh Umar Khan in Sierra Leone and Ameyo Adadevoh, who treated Patrick Sawyer, Nigeria\u2019s patient zero, in a small Lagos hospital. Adadevoh set up aggressive barrier nursing, organised the disinfection of the hospital, and downloaded and distributed Ebola factsheets. For six days, the clinic\u2019s staff effectively ran an Ebola isolation unit with no government help. When Liberian presidential officials called to insist Sawyer be released to attend a conference \u2013 he was a high-ranking civil servant \u2013 the hospital refused to let him go. And when an isolation ward was finally set up, Adadevoh visited even as other doctors refused to volunteer to staff it. Read her full report on the impact of Ebola on West African health systems and health workers here. As survivors you probably won\u2019t get sick again, how does this change how you feel about being around the virus? I have yet to re-encounter the virus. Will let you know when I do! When you got sick what helped you get through it? World class care, a wonderful family and Zmapp! Having seen other Ebola victims firsthand and after suffering the disease yourself, what is the reality? For me it was all about the fear of the symptoms. I was afraid of the vomiting, bleeding and mental disturbance. I was lucky that I didn\u2019t develop any of these. Have you returned to your regular state of health? I really felt fully recovered to 100 percent health before I was discharged or about 10 days after my diagnosis. I know of other survivors that suffer fatigue and weakness long after clearing the virus. Patients that get very sick before recovering may suffer longer term internal organ damage. Again I was fortunate enough to escape all this. What\u2019s the period of time is between someone beginning to recover, and being declared non-contagious? When someone recovers and symptoms (diarrhea, vomiting, bleeding etc) disappear people can be considered broadly non-contagious. At this point they will no longer be heavily shedding virus into the environment. Patients are officially declared virus free and can then be considered non-contagious when bodily fluids are tested and are negative. Semen is an exception and may be infectious long after all else is negative. Times scales vary for all of this from a few days from beginning to recover until virus negative (except semen) and a few weeks. Considering the presumable immunity of survivors, do you think it would be feasible to adopt a policy of recruiting and training volunteer survivors to carry out high-risk work on the ground as the epidemic grows? I think training up immune survivors could be really helpful. The care required by an ebola patient in a resource-poor setting is generally very basic. Helping to keep them clean, assisting them with food and fluid and keeping them in the right place. Medication and IV fluids obviously need to be left to trained professionals but most care can be performed by minimally trained workers, providing they are kind and compassionate. However, it appears that many healthcare workers are being infected in the community as sick neighbours go to see the nurse, say, that lives next door. I encountered this scenario many times in Sierra Leone. So healthcare workers will continue to get infected whether they get onto the ward or not. What more do you think could be done to help people survive Ebola by MSF and the the other organisations on the ground? I think considerable improvements in care could be made by those acting on the ground currently. Aside from the obvious need for more beds, I would emphasise the need to give each Ebola patient the best chance possible. This means treating patients very proactively with IV fluids and appropriate medicines. Currently many think that the best we can do is isolate patients. I believe firmly in treating patients. More people survive if they receive more aggressive supportive therapy. Leave further questions for Pooley or Ebola survivors Harrison Sakilla or Comfort Kollie in the comments. Airline bosses believe there is no significant change needed to protect passengers, and say wider travel has not been affected, reports Guardian transport correspondent Gwyn Topham Willie Walsh, the chief executive of IAG, which controls British Airways, spoke at length to the Guardian and others about Ebola last Friday. British Airways stopped flights to Liberia and Sierra Leone in August, but Walsh said: \u201cThe reason we stopped was that the demand was affected by the outbreak so it was very much a commercial decision first and foremost. \u201cAll of the medical advice we received was that there was no risk to us. We were criticised by some government and health agencies for stopping flying because they felt it was an unnecessary decision.\u201d Walsh said: \u201cWe take advice from the experts and we take measures to ensure our customers are aware of where there might be a risk. It\u2019s clearly a tragedy for the countries involved ... but the experience that we\u2019ve had flying into the region is that the risk is very low. This is a disease that only gets transmitted by direct contact with bodily fluids or secretions. Airlines have become sensitive to any suggestion that they are helping spread the disease, and Walsh said of Thomas Duncan, the Ebola patient who has since died in Dallas: \u201cHe hasn\u2019t spread it to another continent. He [had] it. He said the airline would continue to evalutate whether additional measures need to be taken. Despite the confidence of airline bosses, airline and travel stocks have fallen in recent days as investors feared a perceived Ebola risk would deter the public from travelling abroad. Walsh said there had been no impact on wider demand for flying away from directly affected areas. Walsh insisted there was \u201cabsolutely no impact on bookings other than on services to cities directly involved. We haven\u2019t seen any changes to booking patterns and Europe has been aware of this for several months.\u201d Hazel Chandler is a documentary maker returned from the epicentre of the outbreak in Kenema The Aruna Street community in Kenema was placed under a 21 day quarantine after five of its members died. So many got sick that at the end of the 21 days a further 21 days was imposed. In all, 35 died. According to one survivor, Aminata: When it rains it becomes flooded. So when people became sick they were vomiting in the water and urinating in the water. We are all using the same bathroom so we all got sick. Thank God I survived. But my husband and two children died. Those quarantined complained of being hungry. One who lived through it said military police never came with promised supplies and only when challenged would deliver Bulgur wheat and beans. But, Fatu said, \u201cBulgur does not suit our stomachs because if you eat it it gives you a runny stomach and you need the toilet and if you go to the toilet a lot they will come and take you and say you have Ebola.\u201d What is the reality of suffering Ebola, and what sort of thoughts went through your mind when you were diagnosed and ill? If you have Ebola you only feel sad and bad. It\u2019s a disease that when you are infected with the virus, even your family cannot come close to you. Even the nurses can only be close to you if they have all the material to protect themselves when they touch you or feed you. You have weakness in the body. You are not even able to move and you have diarrhoea. As for me I never had vomiting, but I had a really strong headache and joint pains. I felt very, very weak. The major thing is the worry. Before people said Ebola has no treatment, so you have to worry. Most get worried, because of the way the disease is explained. Ebola has no treatment, so you think, \u201cHow will I live?\u201d After I started being treated for the symptoms, I started to recover and to feel better, but plenty around me were dying. When I saw the people dying I felt scared. But I was given courage by the nurses that said even though some are dying, you can recover. As survivors you probably won\u2019t get sick again, how does this change how you feel about being around the virus? Well, to the understanding that when you are cured from Ebola you will not easily get the disease again, I say, it depends if you are taking precautions, because the major thing is precaution. Then you can keep by the side of somebody who is contaminated with the virus. Even though some people say you are safe if you have recovered, but you don\u2019t play with this disease. You have to keep up the precautions. The reason is \u2013 even if you cannot get it, but you touch the person who has the virus, you might simply pass it to somebody else who then may not survive from Ebola. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s best not to play with the virus. When you got sick what were the most important things that helped you get through it? You have to call for the ambulance, call the health worker. Then the second thing, they take you to the Ebola management centre. Then they will start to treat you. They take your blood, to test your blood. If you are positive they will help treat the symptoms you are showing. Then they feed you, give you food, give you clean clothes, plates, a spoon and cups to drink, as well as a bucket, water and soap for taking a bath. The nurses can give you courage and medication for the symptoms. There is no medication for the virus, but by reducing the symptoms that you are showing, it can help. What more do you think could be done to help people survive Ebola by MSF and the the other organisations on the ground? To my understanding, the best thing is to carry awareness to the community and the people in the area about Ebola. Also to tell them the facts about the disease as it is rare and people they don\u2019t know. As mentioned before, we should take people like me who are survivors to be part of the awareness, to tell the people the truth. As MSF is doing so much of this already, others should also help and MSF should continue. Considering the presumable immunity of survivors, do you think it would be feasible to adopt a policy of recruiting and training volunteer survivors to carry out high-risk work on the ground as the epidemic grows? There is a lot we still don\u2019t know about this disease. But as there is at least a theoretical and potential risk to survivors working in high-risk areas they will need to follow exactly the same procedures as anyone else. It is too early in the epidemic to say that those who have survived will never be at risk of reinfection. It is better to be cautious and to take full protective measures. Survivors can carry awareness messages for Ebola. Survivors understand the disease. They know the symptoms, they have suffered so much while they are recovering \u2013 it\u2019s hard to cope with the bleeding and diarrhoea. It\u2019s a hard task for you. Also, they will be able to tell people facts about the sickness. They know all about it including what Ebola does to you. For this reason it\u2019s very good if survivors can work in health promotion. Leave further questions for Sakilla or Ebola survivors Will Pooley or Comfort Kollie in the comments. The condition of the Spanish nurse infected with Ebola has worsened, reports Ashifa Kassam in Madrid. Her brother Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Romero told reporters at the Carlos III hospital that her health had deteriorated and she was now intubated. In a television interview with La Sexta he added she was having lung problems. The nurse gave several phone interviews to Spanish media outlets on Wednesday, sounding exhausted as she gave answers that ranged from monosyllabic to a 12-minute conversation. Spanish health authorities on Thursday said that another person had been admitted to the Carlos III hospital. Seven people are now in quarantine and some 80 or so under observation in Spain, including health workers that treated Romero Ramos and two employees at a hair salon where the nurse went for an appointment last week. At the ongoing World Bank meeting in Washington today, where global leaders are discussing the impact of Ebola, the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said that the epidemic has echoes of another. Larry Elliott quotes CDC head Tom Frieden telling the meeting: I have been in public health service for 30 years and the only thing I have seen like this is Aids. We will have to work hard to stop it being the next Aids. We check each other out for breaches in our personal protective equipment and go one after the other into the high-risk zone. We pass by the patients. There isn\u2019t much for them to do so they just sit in plastic chairs staring out. I always stop and say hello to them. Sometimes, before I go in, I will tell them from the outside that I am coming in. I figure that way, they will know who is talking to them from behind the mask. I can\u2019t imagine what it must be like for them, to be brought here and corralled into fenced areas surrounded by alien-like people walking around. I try to be funny so I do the moonwalk in my suit. Big mistake. The staff see me from the outside and many now call me \u201cJackson\u201d. It is my cross to bear. It was a pretty uneventful entry today. Not like recently when I was working in the shower and felt a tug on my leg. When I looked down there was a patient lying naked on the floor next to me. His eyes had the \u201cEbola look\u201d. It is a look they get when they are certain to die from the disease. I turned the shower on to cool him, but he didn\u2019t really react. I then called to Tina, our team lead who was doing the entry with me (we are that short of people that the manager of our centre had to come in with me) and we carried the patient to his bed. He died four days later. War game-style simulations to test Britain\u2019s ability to cope with an outbreak of Ebola will be staged this weekend in hospitals in the north and south of England, report the Guardian\u2019s Robert Booth and Matthew Weaver. Officials at the Department of Health are today drawing up details of at least two simulations which will involve people posing as victims of the deadly virus to assess the real-time response of hospitals, the ambulance service and local authorities. The exercise will take place on either Saturday or Sunday and details of which hospitals will be chosen to handle the mock cases are being kept confidential to minimise disruption to the exercise, an official said. Hazel Chandler is a documentary maker who first went to Sierra Leone in 2004. She runs a charity in Freetown, and has just returned from the epicentre of the outbreak, in Kenema. The road from Freetown to Kenema is peppered with road blocks manned by armed soldiers and police. Where once they were looking for weapons and diamonds, now they stop vehicles, check passes and request you get out, wash your hands and have your temperature taken. Kenema is in the east of Sierra Leone and is one of the largest cities. It was put under quarantine on the 7 August 2014, which means that for two months the roads have been blocked. Without a pass, you cannot get in or out. It is estimated that more than 200 people have died there but the real figure is probably much higher. The district medical officer (DMO), Dr Mohamed Vandi, says that the infection rate has reduced as a result of the quarantine and that people in Kenema are better informed about Ebola than elsewhere in the country. This may or may not be true but the impact of the quarantine is, as yet, unmeasurable. Food shortages, failing businesses, rising prices, social isolation and surviving family members cut off from each other are just some of the problems. There are quarantines within the quarantine. Families or communities of people who have died of Ebola are isolated for 21 days. They can walk in the compound just outside their houses but otherwise cannot leave to work, buy food or medicines or visit family members. There are no people in protective clothing wandering around or white tents, just a soldier with a gun and a variable number of police with only a stick to keep infected people away. Those quarantined sit silently and wait for an unknown outcome. Radio is playing an important role in the fight against Ebola. In Sierra Leone, thousands of people send text messages to DJ Amara Bangura with questions about the virus. Bangura, who is from Makeni, one of the areas most affected by the outbreak, puts the best questions to health experts and government officials on his show Kick Ebola Nar Salone (Kick Ebola out of Sierra Leone), which is broadcast on 35 stations across the country, three times a week. Bangura flew to the UK last week from Freetown. He spoke to Mark Anderson, from our global development desk, about daily life in Sierra Leone at the moment. If you go to Freetown or Sierra Leone generally, there is one slogan that everyone knows: no touching. Everybody says that: no touching, avoid body contact. People talk about hand washing a lot. Sometimes I touch something, I\u2019ll go back and wash my hands. Also, if you\u2019re using public transport, as soon as you get off you wash your hands. The number of passengers in each bus has been seriously reduced. People used to get crammed in the back of a bus, but now it\u2019s just two. This is to avoid body contact. You go to offices, you meet a bucket full of water and soap. In most public areas there are lots of buckets full of water and soap. It\u2019s the practice now. Jim Kim, the World Bank president is hosting a conference on Ebola in Washington and takes up the theme of his Guardian interview, reports Larry Elliott. \u201cWe are still way way behind the curve and we have to scale up the global response, there is a critical need for more trained health workers,\u201d he said. Christine Lagarde, managing director of the IMF, said the fund was dropping its normal opposition to countries borrowing more. In the case of the three west African countries \u201cit is good to increase the deficit. We don\u2019t say that very often,\u201d she said. The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-Moon, said: \u201cWest Africans are scared. The best antidote to fear is an effective and speedy response.\u201d He continued: \u201cCases are growing exponentially. We need a 20-fold surge in our response.\u201d Alpha Cond\u00e9, the president of Guinea, said his country lacked the technical capacity and the financial resources to fight Ebola. Cond\u00e9 said the response needs to have four components: immediate intervention, the strengthening of health and education systems, massive budgetary support and a better explanation of what Ebola is so that investors return. \u201cThis is an international threat and it deserves an international response. All of the west African region is threatened,\u201d he said.

You can also post questions on Twitter using the hashtag #guardianeboladay. Harrison Sakilla became infected when the disease reached his village, Wodu, in the north of the Liberia. The primary school teacher was admitted to the Ebola management centre in Foya where he became its first survivor. After losing seven members of his family to the virus he decided to stay and help others, and now works as a guard at the centre for MSF. Will Pooley became the first known Briton to contract the virus after working in Sierra Leone. He was flown home where he made a full recovery. Pooley has said he is happy to be alive but desperate to keep on helping the Ebola effort. Comfort Kollie works at Phebe hospital in Bong county. Six other nurses contracted the virus in recent months, and Comfort believes it was transmitted to her while she was sitting on the bus with an infectious co-worker. Admitted to the International Medical Corps\u2019 centre in Lofa in mid-September with Ebola, she was cured of the disease and discharged last week. Douda Fullah\u2019s life and family have been torn apart by Ebola. On 24 July he lost his father. Within two weeks, his stepmother and his two-year-old brother died. She was six months pregnant and miscarried in hospital. Douda, 17, then lost his sister and grandmother. He too was admitted to hospital, but survived. Orphaned, he is now left to care for himself and 12 year old brother and 15 year old sister. \u201cI have lost five members of my family. I have no one to take care of me ... I\u2019m begging. Come to our aid. We are suffering. There is no hope for us.\u201d This film is supplied by Street Child was shot with Douda\u2019s permission An unidentified UN medic has become the latest healthcare worker to be sent to Europe for treatment after contracting the Ebola virus. Reuters reports: A medical official with the U.N. Mission in Liberia who tested positive for Ebola arrived in the German city of Leipzig on Thursday to be treated at a local clinic with specialist facilities, authorities said. The unidentified medic infected in Liberia is the second member of the U.N. mission, known as UNMIL, to contract the virus. The first died on Sept. 25. He is the third Ebola patient to arrive in Germany for treatment. \u201cThe man will be treated on an isolation ward... with strict security measures,\u201d said Dr Iris Minde, head of Leipzig\u2019s St Georg clinic in a statement. \u201cThere is no danger of infection for other patients, relatives, visitors or the public.\u201d In Australia, meanwhile, a 57-year old nurse in Cairns, north Queensland, is being tested for Ebola after returning on Tuesday from a month spent treating patients in Sierra Leone for the Red Cross. Bridie Jabour writes that the nurse has been identified as Sue-Ellen Kovack: She was under observation in Cairns hospital, Queensland\u2019s chief health officer, Jeanette Young, confirmed. She had been kept in home isolation and was admitted to hospital with a low-grade fever on Thursday. Young emphasised there was zero risk to the Cairns community of infection as the nurse had followed protocols when returning to Australia. \u201cShe has not been out in the community in Cairns. She has been at home, isolated in her own home, testing herself,\u201d she said. The head of the Australian Red Cross international program, Peter Walton, said the nurse remained upbeat despite her situation. \u201cShe\u2019s doing well, but obviously she just has to play a bit of a waiting game at the moment,\u201d he said. Walton said it was vital Red Cross aid workers were available to help combat the Ebola crisis, but everything possible was done to reduce the risk to them. In the past 21 days, Sierra Leone has reported 924 confirmed cases, or 40% of the total number of deaths in the country since the outbreak began. That\u2019s also the biggest increase out of all three west African countries, reports West Africa correspondent Monica Mark. The new cases have come through a surge in infections in the western area, including the capital Freetown, which previously reported only sporadic cases. The country\u2019s top officials are currently holding a closed door meeting in Freetown to discuss. \u201cWe can\u2019t explain exactly why the numbers have gone up in the western area, but we\u2019re going to discuss how to tackle it,\u201d said Brima Kargbo, the chief medical officer. At the moment Sierra Leone has 304 beds, which is well short of the 1,100-odd beds the WHO estimates it needs. Two burial teams in the western area have also gone on strike over delayed payment. One worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: \u201cWe\u2019re risking our lives and we\u2019re not being paid for it. And since we started this work, people have been talking a lot \u2013 we\u2019re not welcome in our community anymore.\u201d One bright spot: there\u2019s been a dramatic decrease in the eastern region bordering Guinea and Liberia, where the transmissions started and were initially highest. Health campaigns have been concentrated in this area for months now, and some districts are now going days without reporting any new cases. Nick Owen, one of a number of volunteers taking part in a six-month trial in the UK of an Ebola vaccine, has been speaking to the Guardian\u2019s Ben Quinn. The vaccine he has been given is called ChAd3, which uses a single benign Ebola virus protein (one seventh of the whole virus) to generate an immune response. It\u2019s carried into the body by a vector, in this case a chimpanzee adenovirus \u2013 or, a common cold. He was deliberately given a virus as it gets inside cells and produces a particular type of immunity. A chimp virus is being used as people are often immune to human common colds, meaning the vaccine wouldn\u2019t have a chance to begin to work. Essentially, it\u2019s a process of tricking the immune system into thinking it has an infection. He said: \u201cThe day after I had the vaccine I felt a bit fluey and had a sore arm but by the evening I was absolutely fine. I think it\u2019s a really small price to pay for what we can potentially get out of this vaccine if it\u2019s going to prevent outbreaks of the magnitude we have seen so far this year.\u201d Owen, who works for MSF but has been taking part in the trials as a volunteer (the charity has no connection with the trials) has also written a blog about his experience. Friends and family have said I must be mad to want to take part, but I struggle to see the issue. As I write, 10 of my MSF colleagues have died treating this virus, along with hundreds of other healthcare workers in West Africa. To me, having a sore arm and potentially feeling a bit fluey is a very small sacrifice to make if it means lives will be saved in the future, and that my colleagues can work without putting themselves at even greater risk. Elvis Ogweno is a Kenyan nurse and ambulance coordinator, working at the International Medical Corps facility in Bong County Liberia. Today is a typical day. 5.30am Elvis wakes up each morning at 5.30am. As a Christian, he always prays for protection. \u201cI ask God to give me wisdom in making decisions.\u201d In the context of Ebola, one decision could make the difference between life and death for the patient and for the health care worker, he explains. \u201cI pray for the patients we carry, and my colleagues, who are doing great work. I pray for the country in general.\u201d After his morning shower, Elvis dresses, gathers his laptop and first aid kit, and heads on over to the Ebola treatment unit to meet with the team. 7.30am \u2013 9.30am As soon as he arrives at the International Medical Corps Ebola treatment unit, Elvis meets with the night shift. He learns that one patient died late last night. The 28-year-old woman will be buried alongside her sister who died a few days earlier. Elvis meets with his ambulance team, which includes four other nurses and six sprayers, and informs them that they will be making a two-hour trek to Kakata in Margibi County. That sounds like a long journey, but they are actually relieved, because their last few pickups have been in Mawah, which is twice as far away. After briefing Elvis conducts a vehicle check. The tank is full and spare tires are in the bed of the truck. They\u2019re ready to go. 12.16pm The two International Medical Corps ambulances, Rescue 1 and Rescue 2 arrive at the village in Kakata. Elvis rides in Rescue 1 with the nurses, where he used the journey time to review protocol and mentally prepare himself. \u201cI always try to ask myself, \u2018What is happening with the family? What is going through their minds?\u2019 It helps me to understand their distress.\u201d Donning a mask, gown and gloves with a pen and paper in hand, Elvis dismounts from the ambulance and walks up to the family. \u201cHello, my name is Elvis. I\u2019m from the Ebola Treatment Unit. We\u2019re here to help.\u201d As he is talking with the family, the sprayers lay out the tarp and begin preparing the personal protective equipment that will keep his team safe. Three members of the family are showing symptoms of Ebola virus, with fever, diarrhoea, and vomiting. Five members of this family have died in recent weeks, of suspected Ebola. There are another nine people living in the same home, including several children. Elvis is eager to get his three newest patients out of the house and back to the Ebola treatment unit where they can receive treatment. Tom Dart reports from Dallas in the hours after Thomas Eric Duncan died and his family, now living in quarantine, were left to mourn in isolation. It had been planned as a vigil but the service quickly turned into a memorial once the news broke that Ebola had killed Eric Duncan, the first victim of the virus in the US. Before his condition worsened and he died in a Dallas hospital at 7.51am local time on Wednesday, eight days after his diagnosis was confirmed, Duncan\u2019s last words were spoken to a nurse from the bed in his isolation room: a request to see Karsiah, the son he last saw sixteen years ago, when the boy was three. That final hope went unfulfilled. A student in San Angelo, 250 miles away, Karsiah was staying in Dallas and preparing to head to Texas Health Presbyterian hospital on Wednesday in the hope of seeing Duncan at about 9am when his mother called him to tell him his father was dead. The sense of disconnection and distance even from relatives in the same city was replicated at Wilshere Baptist Church on Wednesday evening at a service that was mainly for Duncan\u2019s close friends and family but necessarily took place without them. A toddler, a fruit bat, and a village in southern Guinea. That\u2019s how the current Ebola outbreak found its origins, writes Clar Ni Chonghaile: In December last year, near the village of Meliandou in southern Guinea, two-year-old Emile was bitten by one of the fruit bats that fly through west Africa\u2019s skies, often gathering at dusk to roost in trees. The village is reported as lying within a forested area close to three countries\u2019 borders: Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The ease with which these borders can be crossed, due partly to years of conflict, has seen this region become the Ebola outbreak\u2019s \u201chot zone\u201d. From Meliandou, WHO researchers believe the virus was able to swiftly travel to neighbouring towns, to Guinea\u2019s capital Conakry, and across the border to Sierra Leone. So began a chain of viral devastation, whose links represent individual lives cut short and ineluctable steps on Ebola\u2019s path through west Africa. We\u2019re getting a number of questions coming through about Ebola itself, and the ways people can contract the virus. Lauren Gambino has answered 10 commonly-asked questions on Ebola in this explainer. They include: Can you get Ebola from sneezing? It is possible to spread through coughing or sneezing, but health officials say it\u2019s unlikely. Saliva or mucus from an infected person would have to get into a healthy person\u2019s eyes, nose, mouth or open wound for the disease to spread. Can it spread through mosquitoes? There is no evidence to support this. Humans, bats, monkeys and apes have the ability to spread the Ebola virus, but evidence so far indicates that mosquitoes and other insects can\u2019t transmit it. Is it airborne? Not currently. If you have a question that hasn\u2019t been answered, let us know in the comments below. Njala Giema is a village in eastern Sierra Leone, set deep in the forest off the highway from Kenema to Kailahun. The hamlet had a population of about 200 people; at least 61 have died since Ebola struck in May. Locals say the disease was brought by relatives of a nurse infected in the nearest town, Daru. The village has been in lockdown as Sierra Leone quarantined a million people in an attempt to slow Ebola\u2019s spread. Full set of pictures from Ashley Hamer here In the UK, the government has today urged calm and indicated that it has no immediate plans to introduce screening for Ebola at UK border points. There\u2019s no need for hysteria or panic of that kind,\u201d Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, said in a round of broadcast interviews. \u201cEvery GP surgery, every hospital in the country knows how to handle this, how to check for symptoms. I think we need to be calm and measured about this and just make sure that if symptoms are identified that people get to be checked as quickly as possible. While the chairman of the home affairs committee, Keith Vaz, has called for testing measures to be put into place for people entering Britain, Mark Tran and Rowena Mason report that Fallon rejects these calls on the grounds that such screening should be carried out at their point of departure instead: The World Health Organisation advises that screening is best done when you leave a country, when you leave Sierra Leone or leave Liberia or Guinea, rather than the country you come into,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are no direct flights at the moment from Sierra Leone to Britain so it\u2019s not possible to be 100% sure of everybody who\u2019s coming here. Britain will send 750 military personnel to West Africa in a bid to help halt the outbreak, it was reported on Wednesday. Ashifa Kassam reports from Madrid, where six people are now in quarantine after a nurse became the first person in the current outbreak to be infected outside Africa. Six people are in quarantine in Madrid\u2019s Carlos III Hospital and another 84 are being monitored for any signs of Ebola, health authorities said on Thursday. Those in isolation include Teresa Romero Ramos, the Spanish nurse who on Monday became the first known person to contract Ebola outside of west Africa. Her husband, who has not shown any symptoms, also remains in isolation as a precautionary measure. Two doctors were admitted to the hospital - a specialised hub for attending to potential Ebola patients in Madrid - on Wednesday evening. Both had treated the Spanish nurse when she arrived at the hospital in Alcorc\u00f3n on Monday with a fever and fatigue. In a letter to his superiors published by several media outlets, one of the doctors detailed the 16 hours he spent on Monday treating the nurse. For much of that time, Juan Manuel Parra Ram\u00edrez and the nurses treating Romero Ramos wore just an impermeable gown, double gloves, a hat and a mask to protect themselves. As the nurse\u2019s state worsened, the health workers changed into a more protective suit. The patient presented diarrhoea, vomiting and coughing, said Parra Ram\u00edrez, complaining that his protective equipment was ill-fitting. \u201cThe sleeves were too short,\u201d he wrote. Despite being on the frontlines of treating the nurse, he wasn\u2019t updated when her test results proved positive, he said. \u201cI learned of the results from journalists rather than the relevant authority.\u201d On Wednesday, a nurse, who was part of the same team as Romero Ramos and treated the two Ebola patients repatriated to Spain, also was admitted to the Carlos III Hospital. She was placed in quarantine as three others were released from the hospital. Two of the nurses from the same team as Romero Ramos and an engineer, who had travelled from Nigeria to Spain, all tested negative for Ebola. Kelfa Kargbo of Street Child - a British charity that turned its 650-strong community workforce in Sierra Leone and Liberia to the Ebola effort two months ago - tells us that his biggest frustration in the fight against Ebola in Sierra Leone is the lack of \u201curgency\u201d shown by \u201cmiddle men\u201d deployed by the government. \u201cMy biggest feeling about this fight against Ebola is frustration. Education of the population has created awareness, but people are still not following the guidelines. There are a lot of mountains to climb and maybe it is poverty and circumstances which causes people to disobey the rules. \u201cMy biggest frustration however, is that certain individuals within government institutions are not contributing to the fight against Ebola. The government is freeing up money and provisions but the middle men are not responding with urgency; they are dragging their feet.\u201d Here, in four diaries he and three of his staff, tell us what they are doing today. Justin Sesay, Port Loko. Deputy regional manager rural projects: As I speak to you now I am very much scared for the district; the government institutions are no longer active here and there is a very real fear of famine. In one village, in the Masimra chiefdom, the whole population has practically been wiped out by the virus. This has greatly affected the community\u2019s ability to generate food; those who have so far survived ran into the bush because their colleagues were dying so rapidly. They have been unable to complete the harvest. Even last week, as I spoke to the section Chief, there was a corpse lying nearby, waiting for a burial team to come. I fear for this district, it is an agricultural district, if the people are unable to have their rice, their ground nut and their crops, there will hunger, extreme hunger. This morning I am busy planning an Ebola training workshop for our teachers which will take place on Friday. It will be crucial in our fight against Ebola; the teachers will play a vital part in educating the community, as they are highly respected. John Momodu Kargbo, Makeni. Head of operations Bombali district There is a family in an area of Makeni called New London, which has lost 21 members. The surviving elderly grandmother has been left to look after her grandchildren, 8 and 6, with just an older boy, himself an Ebola survivor, to help. This family has little support and they\u2019re struggling to survive; the older boy is currently unable to continue working as a motorcycle taxi driver. Their situation is far from unique. This morning I am visiting quarantined homes along with ministry officials to collect information about orphan numbers. Secondly, I am meeting with the district Health and Medical Association to discuss and organise a programme to train Street Child teachers in Ebola prevention. Our plan is to use these teachers to broadcast critical information about the spread and containment of Ebola to rural villages George Quaker, Kenema. Deputy head of operations for Street Child Kenema is in the quarantine zone. One child who we visited last week, Bettie Kargbo, aged 15, has lost her mother and is left to support her two younger siblings aged five and three. Her step-father is away with the military, peace keeping in Somalia. They are in desperate need of support and we, along with the World Food Programme are providing supplies while Bettie and her siblings are in quarantine. Normal people are finding it difficult to get basic food supplies such as bread; it is nearly impossible for orphans. What is good is that Bettie is increasingly receiving support from her neighbours; before, people were scared of helping families who had been in quarantine, but increased awareness and education has really helped to reduce the stigma. I start my work this morning by attending a meeting at the Sierra Leone ministry for social welfare, gender and children\u2019s affairs to discuss data on orphans. We will then revisit communities to confirm the figures. Kelfa Kargbo, Freetown. Director of Street Child of Sierra Leone Today I will be finalising a plan with another NGO, African Medical Mission, who we have contracted to train twenty teachers for us in Lungi just outside Freetown. This training will involve educating the teachers about the causes of Ebola and how the virus can be spread; each teacher will be assigned their own village, it is their responsibility to fully educate everybody in their village about Ebola. With 20 teachers we can reach 20 villages. We realise that people are not fully abreast of the Ebola issue and they have continued engaging in ritual practices, particularly during funerals, which carry a high risk of contamination. Our teachers are respected members of the community who we hope can spread the right messages about Ebola. Lauren Gambino and Tom Dart report from the US that a second man has been admitted to hospital in Dallas after exhibiting symptoms resembling Ebola, following the death of Thomas Eric Duncan on Wednesday: Frisco fire chief Mark Piland said the man had visited the apartment where Duncan stayed after he arrived in the US last week and interacted with some of the people who live there, all of whom are under quarantine and not exhibiting symptoms. He was transported by ambulance to the hospital after going to an urgent care facility with \u201csome\u201d Ebola-like symptoms, which can also be symptoms of other illnesses. The ambulance crew who helped the sheriff into the vehicle wore protective suits and carried out decontamination procedures. The risk of Ebola in this case is thought to be low because the man in question, a law enforcement official, reportedly never came into direct contact with Duncan \u2013 only visiting the apartment where Duncan was staying. Right now, there are more questions than answers about this case,\u201d the hospital said in a statement. The Ebola test takes about 48 hours to return results. Peter Piot, who was part of the research team which discovered the Ebola virus in 1976, warned this morning that further cases of Ebola in Europe are \u201cunavoidable\u201d. He told BBC Breakfast: We will see other cases in Europe, this is unavoidable. People travel, people come back, people get infected in west Africa - volunteers. So we need to be prepared for more cases like this. Piot said, however, that he did not consider the UK to be at high risk. I\u2019m not concerned about an outbreak in western Europe, in the UK, like we are seeing in west Africa. The highest risk is for the staff - nurses, doctors and so on, lab workers in the hospitals where someone would be admitted with Ebola infection. Other developments: \u2022The president of the World Bank, Jim Kim, said the global response to Ebola has \u201cfailed miserably\u201d. He called for a $20bn international fund to react swiftly to health emergencies. \u2022 The first person diagnosed with the disease outside Africa has died in a Texas hospital. Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, had arrived in the US from Liberia before he began to show symptoms. Throughout today, this live blog will bring together reporting and analysis from Guardian correspondents covering the Ebola crisis. Monica Mark and Ashifa Kassam report from West Africa and Madrid, where the first person in the current outbreak to have caught the virus outside of west Africa, nurse Teresa Romero Ramos, is in quarantine. From London, health editor Sarah Boseley will answer questions on the spread of and response to the disease, alongside reports from Lisa O\u2019Carroll, Ben Quinn and Carmen Fishwick. Dan Roberts reports from the US, where Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in that country, died yesterday. Rebecca Davis and Simon Jeffery will be steering the live blog; please do leave comments and questions below the line. You can read tweets from any of our team by clicking on their names. For tweets from volunteers, organisations and journalists covering the crisis worldwide, you could also follow Guardian Africa\u2019s Twitter list here. The death toll from current outbreak of Ebola has now passed 3,800, with over 7000 infected. The UN has called it \u201clikely the greatest peacetime challenge that the United Nations and its agencies have ever faced\u201d. Since the first cases were reported in Guinea at the end of last year, it has ravaged healthcare systems and communities in West Africa and the first cases been diagnosed in Europe and North America. We\u2019ll be spending the day reporting on the crisis, drawing together text, video and pictures to tell the story of Ebola and its effects wherever it has hit. We\u2019ll be inviting you to join us in discussion and participate in a live Q&amp;A with three Ebola survivors and post any questions you have on the disease in the comments, which we will attempt to answer. Over the course of the day we will also be tracking health workers in the affected countries and meeting a Sierra Leone radio presenter trying to fulfil the information needs of his listeners. Later we\u2019ll report live from Washington, where the presidents of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone are to meet the UN secretary general and the heads of the World Bank and IMF. The World Bank president, Jim Kim, on Wednesday told the Guardian the international community had \u201cfailed miserably\u201d in its response to the disease."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
