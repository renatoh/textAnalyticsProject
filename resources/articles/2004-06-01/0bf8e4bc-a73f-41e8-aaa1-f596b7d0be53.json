There was no hiding place for the players after this ignominious chapter in Widnes' 109-year history and Kelly turned the blow torch on them. \"I'm not sure we shouldn't be calling in the police, because this was almost fraud,\" he said. \"Some of my players are picking up good money under false pretences. I was ashamed of the way we performed. I felt sorry for the fans who made the journey.\" Simon Finnigan's 69th minute try for Widnes at least deprived Hull of a second clean sheet in three matches. Hull were anxious to make the right response after their home defeat by Leeds the previous weekend, but they could not have expected to meet such limp opposition. The Widnes defence, especially in the second half, was virtually non-existent, but that did not detract from some richly entertaining attacking play by Hull, notably the 10 passes which ended with Chris Chester scoring their second try after 22 minutes. The scrum-half Richard Horne showed the pace and glorious footwork that marks him out as one of Super League's most exciting talents. But the intelligent kicking game of his half-back partner Paul Cooke, who created two tries and landed 11 goals, made him a close contender to Horne as man of the match along with the prop Paul King. Until the 22nd minute there was no sign of the mayhem to come. Hull led with the first of two tries for Richie Barnett Jr after good work by King and Chester. But after Chester went over, the Widnes collapse began in earnest. Tries from Jason Smith, Shayne McMenemy and Barnett Jr saw Hull move out to 30-0 at half-time. After the break, Horne twisted out of three tackles to give Briscoe his first try before Peter Lupton, Briscoe, Chester and Horne turned the screw, with Colin Best and Kirk Yeaman completing the rout.
