So imagine the pleasure they\u2019re going to get from galloping round the play park on their very own dinosaur or little pony \u2013 a pink unicorn is also available. Beneath the furry exterior of these cuddly creatures you\u2019ll find a lightweight balance bike with a saddle, handlebars and rubbery wheels. The balance bikes help toddlers learn the fundamental skills needed to cycle, including speed, steering, stability and confidence, by letting them scoot forward while having their feet near the ground. They quickly get used to holding their weight over two wheels, without having to worry about brakes, pedals or gears. My Buddy Wheels have been developed by the award-winning design team at Y-Volution \u2013 you can thank them for the Y-shaped Fliker boards that kids weave their way to school on. Before graduating to their own pedal bike, there is the far more important lesson of learning to have fun on two wheels \u2013 and what better way to do that than with these guys. The only downside is that they don\u2019t come in larger sizes. Cool kit Grn Sportswear is a high-performance sustainable teamwear brand.
