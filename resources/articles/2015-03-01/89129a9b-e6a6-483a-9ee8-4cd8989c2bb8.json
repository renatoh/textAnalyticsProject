Michael Keenan has set aside $18m for schools to employ security guards, after the previous Labor government\u2019s decision to fund security arrangements for at-risk schools. \u201cIt\u2019s not about any specific threat. We\u2019re not aware of any specific threat to any of the 54 schools that are receiving this funding but it\u2019s a sensible precautionary measure to make sure that we can improve the confidence of students, parents and teachers who come to these institutions,\u201d Keenan said on Monday morning. The justice minister denied sectarian violence was on the rise in Australia. \u201cWe\u2019re just taking sensible precautions to make sure we\u2019re doing everything we can so that when kids go to school, they are safe,\u201d Keenan said. \u201cThere has been an increase in threat in Australia in general but there isn\u2019t specific threat to any of the institutions that we are funding through the secure schools program.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s about making sure we\u2019re doing everything we can, but people shouldn\u2019t read anything specific into the fact that we\u2019ve created this program and that we\u2019re funding schools to do everything they can to increase their security.\u201d The secure schools program was a Coalition election promise. More than half of the 54 schools identified as at risk are Jewish or Islamic schools. The 17 Jewish schools identified will receive nearly $7.6m, and the 15 Islamic schools will receive $4.4m. The 22 remaining schools, which are government and independent schools, will share $4.6m. Most are in Sydney, though schools in all states and territories apart from Tasmania have received funding. Nearly 100 schools applied for the funding, in what Keenan called \u201ca competitive process\u201d. \u201cWe worked very closely with state education departments and we also worked closely with the peak bodies to identify what was an appropriate response to the slightly increased risk that some schools might have because of the profile of the student body and the community in which they are,\u201d Keenan said. The deputy prime minister, Warren Truss, told Channel Seven on Monday morning it was unfortunate the federal government had to fund security in schools. \u201cI wish we didn\u2019t. I wish we could go to school in all the innocence of the era when I went to school. It is a pity that we have to provide this level of protection,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the other hand, we know that almost every public place is a potential target and therefore, governments have a responsibility to do what we can to keep people safe.\u201d Truss said the funding would be targeted to specific schools. \u201cIt would be an appalling thing if in fact there was to be some kind of terror attack in our schools. Clearly we need to take all reasonable precautions to prevent that from happening. It\u2019s not as though every school will have guards and additional security measures. But where there are particular risks, identified risks, I think governments have to respond,\u201d he said. The prime minister, Tony Abbott, last week warned that Australia was entering an era of heightened terrorist threats."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
