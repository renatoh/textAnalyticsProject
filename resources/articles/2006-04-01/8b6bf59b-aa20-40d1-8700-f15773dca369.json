They must play four of their last six Premiership fixtures at a venue which, aside from being the most outdated in the division, is also among the most intimidating. Portsmouth hope those surroundings will work to their advantage against an Arsenal team tonight that has excelled in recent weeks on some of the grandest stages of all. \"There's a few young lads who have played all their lives in the Premier League and don't really know what it is like coming to a good old-fashioned ground like Fratton Park,\" said the midfielder Gary O'Neil. \"If we can get among them in the first 20 minutes it might shake them up a bit. The only way to play Arsenal is to get in their faces and press them as hard as you can.\" It was Manchester United who first appeared to exploit Arsenal's weakness against opponents who adopt a high tempo and physical approach when they ended their record-breaking unbeaten run of 49 league games in 2004. This season, Arsenal have suffered 11 defeats in the Premiership and, significantly, nine of them have come away from Highbury. That statistic supports the theory that Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's talented young players are not best suited to the hustle and bustle of English football. Portsmouth's manager Harry Redknapp is clear about how his team must play. \"We have to get after them, compete and make tackles,\" he said. \"If you stand off them and show them too much respect they will murder you. We've got to be aggressive.\" With 10 points from their last four matches, Pompey have been transformed in the past month from a team looking certainties for the drop to one the bookmakers now narrowly favour to survive. Tonight's match was postponed 18 days ago because of a waterlogging and is the first of three in six days, which Redknapp expects to be pivotal. \"It's not ideal to be playing Wednesday, Saturday and Monday,\" said the manager, \"but we have to have a go in all the games. This week is going to be a big deciding factor. This is our game in hand and it will make a massive difference if we pick something up. \"By the Charlton game on Monday we should all have a good idea where we are going. There's no chance of Fulham or Aston Villa being dragged into it, so it's between us Birmingham and West Brom. I'd settle for 38 points now for sure. That should be enough, but you never know. You might need four wins.\" Few are more experienced in this sort of situation than Redknapp. He must carefully consider how to use his resources over the next six days. His \u00a34.1m striker Benjani Mwaruwari has yet to score since joining in January and he may prefer Svetoslav Todorov in attack alongside Lomana LuaLua. Andy O'Brien and Wayne Routledge are also pushing to start. \"Some will play all three games for us and some will find it very difficult,\" said Redknapp. \"We have to get the balance right. \"Routledge is a good option - he did well when he came on against Blackburn. Benjani has looked fantastic in training, sharp and strong, and Todorov has done great when he's come off the bench. We have got options and we will have a look at it.\" Dealing with the threat of the Premiership's top scorer Thierry Henry, who endeared himself to Portsmouth's fans when he applauded them after a 5-1 FA Cup win at Fratton Park two years ago, will also clearly be crucial. \"I think he is the best player in the world,\" said Redknapp. \"How do you deal with a genius? He [Wenger] left Henry out against United but maybe he has targeted the games he thinks they can win to finish above Tottenham. \"I think they have got a fantastic chance of winning the Champions League. They have been in fantastic form. There have been a few enforced changes - the people they have changed at the back have done great jobs. Flamini has settled, Ebou\u00e9 looks like a superstar of the future, Senderos and Tour\u00e9 are both settled - they have lots of top players and they are going for a place in the top four.\" Harry's guide to staying up Man management Redknapp's relaxed personality encourages his players to express themselves without the fear of failure Tactics Rather than sit back, defend and hope to snatch goals on the break, Redknapp's teams decide their own fate by playing attacking football Wheeling and dealing Redknapp's eye for a player and the backing of his chairman Milan Mandaric allowed him to find quality players quickly in the January transfer window and carry out significant surgery to the team, with the likes of Pedro Mendes joining Lomana LuaLua, signed by Redknapp in his first spell at the club Managing the media Always available and good for a quote, Redknapp's handling of the media promotes good PR and maximises the feelgood factor Managing expectation From the moment he returned as Portsmouth manager in December, Redknapp has avoided adding to the pressure on his players by consistently stressing the uphill task they face Never panic Portsmouth looked as good as relegated five weeks ago, but Redknapp did not waver and stuck by the team he had reshaped during the transfer window Pompey then and now November 5 2005, Portsmouth 0-2 Wigan: Perrin's last home match in charge (3-3-3-1) Ashdown, Primus, Stefanovic, Priske, Griffin, Huges, Vignal, O'Neil, Vukic, Taylor, Silva April 8 2006, Portsmouth 2-2 Blackburn: Redknapp's revamped line-up (4-4-2) Kiely, Priske, Primus, Stefanovic, Davis, Mendes, D'Alessandro, Taylor, O'Neil, Mwaruwari, LuaLua"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
