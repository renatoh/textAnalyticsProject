Firearms accounted for $657.6m of sales \u2013 an increase of 23.8% from last year. Accessories \u2013 including holsters, magazines, cases and brand apparel \u2013 accounted for $65.3m. Overall sales reached $722.9m \u2013 an increase of 31% from the year before, the company announced. Smith &amp; Wesson\u2019s sales have risen over 200% since Barack Obama was elected president. Gun sales have soared after a spate of mass killings that have sparked fears among buyers of tighter gun control laws. There is anecdotal evidence that the same pattern has followed the murder of 49 people at a gay club in Orlando last weekend. In May, there were 1.87m background checks for new arms licenses, a record for the month and the 13th consecutive month that a new monthly record had been set. Background checks do not necessarily translate into sales, as not all checks result in a sale and multiple firearms can be bought with a single background check. Yet manufacturers often rely on background checks to measure demand and overall health of the market. James Debney, Smith &amp; Wesson president and chief executive officer, said that the company benefited \u201cfrom strong consumer demand\u201d. The demand has been driven up by increased fear over terrorist attacks and Americans\u2019 desire to protect themselves, as well as an increased push for gun control. Smith &amp; Wesson expects to make between $740m to $760m in net sales in 2017 fiscal year. The guidance does not take into account any potential surge due to mass shootings. On a call with analysts, Jeffrey Buchanan, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, also said that the guidance is exclusive of the election and political cycle, implying that it is not tied to any potential gun control regulations. When asked if the guidance was already in place before Orlando shooting, Buchanan reiterated that it is too early to tell what impact that shooting might have on demand and sales. \u201cAll we can do as a business is focus on things we know,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s only been a couple of days so it\u2019s hard to say [if there\u2019s] any long-term impact based on two to three days of activity.\u201d Summer is a slow season for gunmakers and Smith &amp; Wesson hopes to build up inventory before the fall hunting seasons and the winter\u2019s \u201cgift-giving\u201d season. \u201cIt\u2019s be nice to build some inventory,\u201d said Debney. \u201cThere might be some challenges there.\u201d The evening before Smith &amp; Wesson announced its fiscal results for 2016, Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, staged a 14-hour filibuster to secure a vote on a proposal to implement universal background checks and a proposal to bar suspected terrorists on the FBI watch list from purchasing firearms. Senate Republicans signaled that they would offer other competing measures, implying that the other two proposals are unlikely to pass through the Senate. Even as gun control legislation remains unlikely, demand for firearms has surged, driving the value of gunmakers\u2019 stocks. By end of 2015, the stock value of both Smith &amp; Wesson and Sturm Ruger almost doubled. On Monday, the day after the Pulse nightclub shooting, Smith &amp; Wesson shares rose by as much as 11.6% and Sturm Ruger by 10.7%. By the time markets closed on Thursday, however, those gains were erased. Following Smith &amp; Wesson\u2019s announcement, shares once again rose sharply in the after-hours trading."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
