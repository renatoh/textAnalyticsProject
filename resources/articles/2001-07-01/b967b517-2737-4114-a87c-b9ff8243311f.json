The prime minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, met this morning at Mr Blair's country home, Chequers, before heading together for the talks at Weston Park. Speaking at Chequers, Mr Blair said: \"We feel a very great sense of obligation to try and agree the remaining issues. They are there, they are obvious, they are not going to go away. He added: \"It is very much better to be negotiating and working through the difficulties by dialogue than, as you can see from the situation in the Middle East, for people to be resolving these issues through violence.\" Mr Ahern said: \" Over these next few days, if we work together ... I believe we can come to a sensible conclusion.\" But others arriving at Weston Park today were less optimistic. The Ulster Unionist leader, David Trimble -who earlier quit his post as Northern Ireland's first minister after the IRA failed to decommission any of its weapons - said the success or failure of the peace process was in the hands of the IRA. \"There was always going to be a moment of truth in this process when we would find out whether the republicans were prepared to discard their Armalite. You cannot have a democratic process where one party retains weapons. They can't go forward into the future with both the Armalite and the ballot box - they have got to discard one or the other,\" Mr Trimble said. There was a similarly gloomy assessment from the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, as he arrived for the talks saying that the peace process was in \"considerable difficulties\". But he denied that the peace process would fail over the next few days. Mr Adams said: \"The only way that this will fail is if people like us give up and we are not for giving up.\" The four stumbling blocks in the talks triggered by Mr Trimble's resignation are: paramilitary decommissioning, demilitarisation of areas such as South Armagh, reform of the Royal Ulster constabulary, and establishment of cross-border institutions. Under the terms of the agreement, there are five weeks left for Mr Trimble to be reinstated or replaced. Arriving today, SDLP leader John Hume agreed that there was no question of renegotiating the Good Friday agreement at Weston Park. He said: \"We are not negotiating, we are talking about implementing what the agreement has already decided.\" Asked whether there was a particular onus on Sinn Fein to move on the issue of decommissioning, Mr Hume said: \"The emphasis is on the government in certain areas, it is on Sinn Fein, it is on the UDP and PUP, because all paramilitaries must be involved in the decommissioning aspect.\" But Mr Adams said it was not for Sinn Fein to deliver on decommissioning. He said: \"The IRA are not at these talks and I would be very surprised if the government attempted to push an agenda other than what I have underlined, and that is the Good Friday agreement.\" Related articles 09.07.2001: Chances of deal played down 09.07.2001: Northern Ireland peace talks explained 09.07.2001: Drumcree march passes peacefully Press review 09.07.2001: What the Irish papers say Useful links Ulster Unionists Democratic Unionist Party Sinn Fein Social Democratic and Labour Party Belfast Telegraph Irish Times Irish News Northern Ireland Office Cain (Conflict Archive on the Internet)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
