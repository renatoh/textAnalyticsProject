Everton have spent almost \u00a3100m on seven additions to their senior ranks and Koeman still hopes to sign Gylfi Sigurdsson, valued at \u00a350m by Swansea City, a striker, plus a left-sided defender before the transfer deadline. Baines admits \u201cit is an exciting time\u201d to be an Everton player and supporter \u2013 both, in his case \u2013 and this season\u2019s objective is to end the club\u2019s 22-year trophy drought. But the left-back has cautioned Everton have a formidable challenge ahead with the majority of leading clubs investing heavily this summer. \u201cA trophy is the ultimate goal and I think that is what the manager has come here to do \u2013 to push us on to another level, and get us there,\u201d the England international said. \u201cDuring my time and in recent seasons we have just been beneath, we have come close a few times with cup finals, semi-finals, trips to Wembley but falling at the final hurdle. So we have to take that step. \u201cAs a fan, absolutely it would be the ultimate. That is going to be the objective with this project that the manager has taken on. Obviously with the new owner and with the chairman, that is the objective, to take that next step. Everyone understands it will be tough. Tough to spend the money, yes we can go out and do it, but everyone else is going out to do it too. We have already got a bit of a gap to bridge and we are working on it and we hope to do it.\u201d Baines\u2019s deflected goal gave Everton a 1-0 win over Ruzomberok in the Europa League third qualifying round first leg on Thursday as Koeman\u2019s team understandably laboured, four weeks into pre-season. Rooney missed a few chances at centre-forward on his homecoming before switching to the right when new signing Sandro Ram\u00edrez was introduced in the second half. Baines insists the 31-year-old will have an impact on and off the pitch for Everton this season. He said: \u201cI\u2019m fully aware of what Wayne can bring to us and I think he has already shown it in the few weeks he has been here. He\u2019s done well in the games he\u2019s played in, he\u2019s got goals in the other games he played in, and he is a big character in the dressing room for us at half-time, before the games and around the training ground. He\u2019s someone that you need in the squad. You need a handful of players who have got that personality and character. And he comes in as one of them. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a good mix. We\u2019ve got that group of lads who have been here and know what the club is all about, lads who have been around and played a lot of Premier League football, young lads coming through who are full of ability, enthusiasm and excitement and now some foreign players coming in who are new to the league. It\u2019s just about trying to marry the whole thing together and that is obviously the manager\u2019s job.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
