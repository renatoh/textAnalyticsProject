On Thursday night, Greater Western Sydney lost in what was described as \u201ccontroversial\u201d circumstances, conceding five of the last six goals in Essendon coach John Worsfold\u2019s performance review. Shaun McKernan\u2019s game-levelling goal in the dying light of the fourth quarter was disputed by the Giants before time ran out on the much-maligned video review system. On the evidence available, the decision was likely the correct one, but in the context of the divine lunacy and doggerel coming out of AFL House on the score review issue, who could blame anyone for denouncing the decision? Nevertheless, having denied themselves a chance to move into second spot on the ladder, the Giants again seem to be maybe two-thirds as good as we think they are. Collingwood, as a result, holds on to second spot. But on Saturday night\u2019s effort, the Pies appear to be headed for a fall after a 44-point loss to a ruthless North Melbourne who metaphorically beat them about the head with an unvarnished broomstick. \u201cWe\u2019re embarrassed by that performance\u2026 that\u2019s as big a shellacking in general play that you\u2019ll see in a game of footy,\u201d said Collingwood coach Nathan Buckley. \u201cThe white flag went up from us. If you look at all of the things that we value in the way we\u2019ve gone about our footy, we didn\u2019t see it today at all. It\u2019s inexplicable, to be honest. It\u2019s the first time in a long time we\u2019ve seen some average physical efforts.\u201d Norman Mailer wrote that \u201cthere are two kinds of brave men: those who are brave by the grace of nature, and those who are brave by an act of will.\u201d He left out a third \u2013 those who are brave by virtue of being coached by Rhyce Shaw. Make no mistake, this version of the Kangaroos is more brutal than under Brad Scott \u2013 enough to give those clubs with coaching vacancies pause while poring over his r\u00e9sum\u00e9. Neither Adelaide side appear capable of launching a legitimate challenge, despite Port Adelaide beating the premiership favourites just last week. On Saturday night, the rain fell on the Adelaide Oval as if the MCG earlier that day had only been a rehearsal. The miserable conditions did nothing to stop them getting \u201cBonted\u201d in the first quarter, as Marcus Bontempelli helped himself to 11 contested possessions, six clearances and four inside 50s. \u201cHe got us out of the block and set the example in foreign territory,\u201d said Bulldogs coach Luke Beveridge said. \u201cHe handled the ball cleanly and gave us the upper hand and it was a huge first quarter from him.\u201d The Bulldogs will need a huge second, third and fourth quarters from him next week if they are to trouble the ladder leaders, who got past Adelaide with little effort on Friday night, although effort is always hard to gauge in a team whose style appears all ease. It appears that Geelong\u2019s biggest threat is its 90s nemesis, the West Coast Eagles. Like those teams of the 90s, these Eagles hold no fears of the MCG, having now won their past five games there after beating Hawthorn by a goal on Saturday afternoon. Luke Shuey certainly holds no fears of playing on the game\u2019s biggest stage, and along with Jack Darling, was ultimately the difference between the two teams, finishing with 20 contested possessions in the wet as well as 11 clearances and nine tackles. In a backline that was missing Jeremy McGovern and Tom Barrass, Eagles coach Adam Simpson may have just found another uncompromising defender in Oscar Allen, after the 20-year-old ran back with the flight of the ball in the last quarter to take a courageous mark, before being the catalyst for Jamie Cripp\u2019s winning goal just a minute shy of the final siren. \u201cHe\u2019s got leadership (written) all over him,\u201d said Simpson of Allen. \u201cHe does the right thing at the right time.\u201d But Simpson\u2019s biggest smile was reserved for the return of ruckman-slash-cult hero Nic Naitanui who returned after missing close to a year following an ACL rupture in Round 17 last year. While only playing for a little more than half of the game and finishing with just six possessions, Naitanui had a game-high 41 hit-outs. But it was those things you can\u2019t measure on a stat sheet that pleased his coach the most. \u201cThere\u2019s intensity, then there\u2019s Nic intensity, and I reckon we saw that once or twice today,\u201d said Simpson. \u201cIn the last quarter, the first bounce or two, we just saw that intensity no one can match and we\u2019ve missed that.\u201d Among most people who love football there is a desire to see some genuine competition for the Cats in the back half of the season. Although with two months to play, there remains plenty of time for other contenders to emerge, including those who have stumbled of late. On that, the last word of the round must go to Hawthorn coach Alastair Clarkson. \u201cThe capacity to be able to turn things around in this competition is as quick as I\u2019ve ever seen it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
