Lonely Planet says you need to write one year in advance to Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n de Altamira, Santilla del Mar 39330, Cantabria, Spain. There is also an information number, 00 34 942 81 80 05, and there should be someone there who speaks English. The best way to get there is to fly with Go from Stansted to Bilbao, which can be very reasonable, and they do deals on care hire, which is a very good idea if you want see some of the stunning scenery. My recommendation is to spend at least a week in the region, as it'll give you chance to take advantage of cheaper flights and time to travel around. John Lister \u00b7 I suggest Anne Salmon makes friends with a prominent local official or member of the junta. In this way, it'll possible to jump the queue! Some years ago I had the good fortune to visit the Altamira caves and found it the most moving sight I had ever experienced. Whatever you do it, is well worth waiting for. Don't give up . Having visited many similar caves in France, Altamira outshines them all ! Mike Hudson \u00b7 Visits have been restricted to a maximum of 20 a day for a number of years because of the deterioration of the cave paintings due to the presence of over 30 types of bacteria (believed to have been introduced by visitors and then encouraged by the lighting of the cave). Applications for these visits must be made in writing (only) to Museo y Centro de Investigacion de Altamira. The most recent news was that there was a waiting list of over three years (and even longer for popular dates, such as holiday weekends). However, following the recent completion and opening of the new museum and full-scale replica of the cave and its paintings a couple of miles away, the Ministry of Culture closed the cave completely on the September 30 to facilitiate a full-scale scientific investigation. What has been happening at Altamira, even with very restricted visiting, seems to have been very similar to the disastrous deterioration of the paintings in the Lascaux cave in France 30 years ago, and the long-term result of the new investigation is very likely to be the same: a permanent closure to all visitors. Professor Patrick Boylan \u00b7 We visited this October, by chance, on a Sunday (when entrance is free). It was extremely busy, but not impossible, and we had to wait a short time before taking a tour of the replica of the caves. This is a very realistic fibreglass reproduction of the actual caves and paintings. Not, of course, the real thing, but highly recommended. The museum is excellent, with English translations. It is closed on Mondays, Jan 1-6, 1 May 24-25, Dec 31. Otherwise open from 9.30am to 5 pm (later in summer). In the high season, feast days and Holy week, it is very popular, so one should book in advance. Tel: (+34) 902 24 24 24 or 912 11 22 11 or visit Banco Santander Gill Cardy \u00b7 Bookings have to be made by letter or fax at least two months in advance, depending on the time of year, and the museum's web site (Museos Altamira) shows what dates are available. However, a duplicate cave and an excellent museum have been built on the site, which are open daily all year round, except for Mondays and national holidays. Visits are guided, with a choice of several languages. They leave at 10-minute intervals.You can just turn up, buy a ticket and wait for the next available tour. You will be told how long this is likely to be, so that you may take the opportunity to go round the museum while you are waiting.
