Henman missed three match points and a possible place in the quarter-finals on his way to a 6-3, 6-7, 5-7 defeat in three hours by Wimbledon finalist David Nalbandian. The mercury was rising to 41C and the ball boys were armed with ice packs, parasols and fans. But the pain of defeat for Henman would have been stoked by the knowledge that he might easily have won in straight sets. He had the match by the throat after one hour and 40 minutes, was leading by one set and 6-3 in the tiebreaker and appeared well on his way towards the air-conditioned comfort of the locker-room. Six minutes later, courtesy of a double fault on match point on his serve, the contest was level and Nalbandian was screaming 'Vamos!' like a man possessed. An hour after that the Argentinian had match points of his own as Henman served at 5-6 and, unlike Henman, capitalised at the first time of asking. Five weeks ago few people had heard of Nalbandian, than he stunned everyone, himself included, by making it all the way to the last Sunday of Wimbledon before losing out to Lleyton Hewitt. Toronto's tennis fans gave him enough of a welcome to suggest his name now rang a bell and he started like a man on a roll. Nalbandian, kitted out all in dark brown despite the heat at courtside, exerted the early pressure. The British No1, never a fan of early starts that force him to wake earlier than he would like, duly surrendered his serve at 1-1. But the exuberance of youth occasionally gets the better of 20-year-old Nalbandian, despite the ferocity of his strokes and invention with the ball. At 4-3 he returned the break to Henman, who made the wasteful Argentinian pay again at 4-5. The second set looked like being a facsimile of the first, with an early break for Nalbandian followed, a few games later, by Henman levelling for 4-4. The action strayed markedly from the script, however, once Henman had built up that healthy and potentially unassailable lead in the tiebreaker. In some ways, it was a familiar story to those who have watched enough of Henman. For all the tweaks and improvements which have been achieved under his coach, Larry Stefanki, the old doubts remain about Henman's ability to put opponents away. Henman and Stefanki have been together a year this week but some things in his game have not changed yet. The very real fear is that now they never will and Henman will be destined to look back at his four Wimbledon semi-finals as the peak of a career that failed to fulfil his dearest desires."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
