This gnomic pronouncement, coupled with Diski's insistence that she didn't want to write a book in the first place (\"but I have to earn a living\"), is a warning not to expect a straightforward, let-the-good-times-and-stock-roll account of her time on America's railroads. Stranger on a Train is part confession (\"for me familiarity is difficult\"), part reluctant travelogue (her editor asks her to \"put in more landscape and scenery\"), part cultural comment (the \"world\" of \"World Series\" reveals \"what Americans really thought of themselves\") and part memoir of Diski's struggle with depression and drug addiction in her 20s. The cipher for this strange journey is the circle: more specifically, London Underground's Circle Line, which the adolescent Diski rode all day in the company of tramps, businessmen and drunks, \"because everyone has to have a place to go\". Circles divide space into an inside and an outside - an us and a them, if you like - and while circling the margin of the US, Diski leaves no doubt as to whose side she's on: \"I... experience an innate and unresolved dislike of authority in any form.\" One of us, then. Stranger on a Train is full of such cosily circumscribed spaces: a tiny sleeping compartment, a borrowed trailer, a glassed-in smoking section. Diski's intense preoccupation with her pack a day (\"What I did, who I spoke to, what I had to say, was very often directly related to my wish to smoke\") underlies the first of the book's divisions. A young acquaintance is dropped: \"Troy wasn't a smoker. Already we were in different camps.\" Wistful non-smokers peer in at the grubby camaraderie of the smoking car. So far, so back-of-the-bike-sheds. Diski's subtle moral entrenchment is more suspect. Amish children are \"too neat, quiet and well-behaved\", while their parents exhibit a \"terror of individuality and modernity\"; a black woman with her children \"exhibited what to Bet was a proper understanding of social control and correct public behaviour\"; and two crass Chicagoans are unable to share Diski's rapture at the featureless Dakota prairies: \"Hey, didn't we pass that fencepost a couple of hours ago?\" The empty landscape echoes the snowy wastes of Diski's earlier memoir, Skating to Antarctica. Emptiness is a feature of her books: a zero-circle which she fills, in Stranger on a Train, with a miscellany of life histories veering from the fascinating to the irritating to the revealing. Flashes of insight along the way provide sparse compensation for her own summary of the journey: \"Blankness outside as well as in the empty centre.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
