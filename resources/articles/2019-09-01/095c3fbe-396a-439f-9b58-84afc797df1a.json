White House officials toured Los Angeles this week to study the crisis in the region amid reports that Donald Trump was pushing for ways to clear the streets of encampments and homeless people. It\u2019s unclear how the federal government could legally attempt to target people on the streets. But given the administration\u2019s continuing efforts to slash funding for low-income housing programs and social services, and the president\u2019s repeated derogatory attacks on California cities, some advocates for the homeless said they were not confident that the White House would provide any useful support. \u201cThe federal government should behave with compassion. We don\u2019t need Trump\u2019s tough talk to compound the trauma people are dealing with,\u201d said Stephen \u201cCue\u201d Jn-Marie, a Los Angeles pastor who works with people living at Skid Row, the epicenter of the crisis. \u201cAnyone who comes to Skid Row to \u2018crack down\u2019 and not actually deal with the root causes \u2026 we\u2019re not listening. I really don\u2019t want to hear what the president has to say.\u201d Trump, who has made insulting California a consistent campaign theme, told Fox News this summer that he wanted to \u201cintercede\u201d on homelessness, citing San Francisco streets and saying: \u201cWe may do something to get that whole thing cleaned up. It\u2019s inappropriate.\u201d He also called the city \u201cdisgusting\u201d. A White House spokesman said on Tuesday that the president had taken notice of the crisis \u201cparticularly in cities and states where the liberal policies of overregulation, excessive taxation, and poor public service delivery are combining to dramatically increase poverty and public health risks\u201d. Trump was exploring the subject as a way to highlight the failures of Democratic leaders, according to reports in the Washington Post and New York Times. The Rev Andy Bales, CEO of Union Rescue Mission, a Los Angeles homeless organization, met with some of the Trump officials this week and said he was optimistic. Bales said he would like to see the federal government provide support for building a new shelter and more bathrooms and that the administration leaders he took on a tour of Skid Row seemed focused on offering resources. \u201cThey said: \u2018We are just here to help people in any way we can,\u2019 and I take them at their word.\u201d San Francisco, Los Angeles, Oakland and other California cities all have worsening housing emergencies, with expanding income inequality and the rising costs of housing forcing people to live in their cars, makeshift sheds and growing tent encampments. \u201cPresident Trump could address the homelessness crisis as the chief executive of the federal government, which is the same entity that caused the homelessness crisis,\u201d said Jennifer Friedenbach, the executive director for the Coalition on Homelessness, in San Francisco. \u201cHe has been slashing programs \u2026 and people are out there are suffering that he is responsible for. He is blaming them for a situation he is creating.\u201d Trump has pushed major budget cuts for public housing and low-income assistance programs and has fought to curb access to food stamps and other services that can help people avoid displacement. \u201cWe need the restoration of public housing,\u201d said Adam Rice, an organizer with Los Angeles Community Action Network (LA Can), who works at Skid Row and was previously homeless. \u201cLet\u2019s actually have a discussion about homelessness on a national stage.\u201d Rice and other advocates pointed out that city leaders in LA have repeatedly put resources into sweeps and policing with policies that echo the rhetoric of the president. LA politicians are considering new rules that would further restrict where people can sleep in the city. Friedenbach said she would be concerned about any federal efforts that would attempt to forcibly remove people off the streets, adding: \u201cThat doesn\u2019t do anything to address homelessness.\u201d Jn-Marie said it was difficult to know whether to take the president seriously but added: \u201cIt\u2019s not past Trump to use people as his political pawns.\u201d Bales, who met with the administration, said the officials from across a number of federal agencies did not talk about sweeps: \u201cI don\u2019t know about people\u2019s motivations. All I care about is resources coming our way. We are in such a desperate situation. We should accept any help.\u201d If the Trump administration were genuinely interested in tackling the problem, it could restore budgets and help provide public land for affordable housing for the neediest people, said Pete White, LA Can\u2019s executive director. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to come to town, actually be helpful and not harmful.\u201d White said he was not optimistic: \u201cI think it\u2019s a political play he is making. All of this is a setup for 2020.\u201d Trump\u2019s anti-homeless rhetoric can have real consequences, White added, noting recent reports of violence and attacks against people in encampments. In the LA region, there have also been growing concerns about \u201cvigilante\u201d Facebook groups where residents harass and shame homeless people, posting bullying and hateful comments. Paul Read, another local advocate, said it would be powerful if Trump and leaders across California \u201cstand together and speak in unity and say: \u2018We need to resolve this and get it done\u2019\u201d. But, he added, \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s going to happen\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
