No, I\u2019m not talking about the ruddy general election, but Christmas. I know it\u2019s a time of goodwill to all men, but we must draw the line at that unpleasant migratory visitor, the part-timer drinker and his inexcusable abuse of the English language. In the past week, I, a hardened toper, have heard customers, unused to the etiquette of the taproom, offer the following - \u201cI\u2019ll take a pint of\u2026\u201d; \u201cGive me a pint of\u2026\u201d; \u201cI\u2019ll get a pint of\u2026\u201d; \u201cGimme a pint of\u2026\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll do a pint of\u2026\u201d OK, the last two were Americans and a more charitable type might give them more latitude but\u2026 The pained expressions of the bar staff faces clearly said: \u201cNo, could you please just say, \u2018May I have a pint of\u2026?\u2019\u201d Just so. Talking of etiquette reminds me of when I was playing golf in Canada and hooked up with a roadie for a local rock band. Good company, but rather short of temper, he grew increasingly frustrated by the tortoise-like play of the fourball in front. The eruption was worth the wait. \u201cShow some fucking etiquette,\u201d he bellowed down the fairway. A noble sentiment, but perhaps something of an own goal. On other matters sporting, rugby club Saracens have been handed a walloping fine and points deduction for financial irregularities. Their captain, Brad Barritt, was asked how the team would approach the rest of the season. \u201cAn old team-mate used to say, \u2018How do you eat an elephant?\u2019 The answer is, one piece at a time.\u201d Blimey, these pachyderms in the room get everywhere. I only await one of the Christmas part-timers saying \u201cI\u2019ll do a trunk\u201d and my Christmas will be complete. \u2022 Jonathan Bouquet is an Observer columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
