The Warriors announced on Thursday that Kerr will need time off for rehabilitation and recovery. Kerr underwent back surgery to repair a ruptured disc in late July and had follow-up surgery in September. \u201cAfter the first two days of training camp, I realized I need to take a step back and focus on my rehabilitation in order to be ready for the grind of another NBA season,\u201d Kerr said in a statement. \u201cAs I noted last week, my summer was difficult and no fun due to the multiple back surgeries. At this point, I simply want to get healthy and back to my normal daily routine on and off the court.\u201d The Warriors said they don\u2019t know yet how long Kerr will be out. \u201cAt this point, the most important thing is to make sure Steve is healthy, completely recovered and ready for not only the rigors of a long NBA season, but day-to-day life in general,\u201d general manager Bob Myers said. \u201cWe don\u2019t anticipate the recovery process will be long term, but as of today we don\u2019t know the exact timeframe. We\u2019ll evaluate his progress daily and provide updates as necessary.\u201d The Warriors won their first NBA title in 40 years in Kerr\u2019s first year as coach last season. Walton was an assistant for Golden State last season and moved into the lead assistant role this summer after Alvin Gentry left to take the head coaching job in New Orleans. \u201cLuke is fortunate enough to have played and coached under some great coaches,\u201d Myers said last week. \u201cHe has an innate ability to think the game, to learn the game and also to communicate the game.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
