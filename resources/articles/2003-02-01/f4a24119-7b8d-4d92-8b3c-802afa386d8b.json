The seminar, organised by the Policy Network thinktank, is a precursor to a third way summer conference. Tony Blair told the seminar that the left had to be careful not to repeat the mistakes of the past by ignoring the electorate's genuine anxieties over terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. He warned that the left had been behind the curve on the previous \"insecurity\" issues of asylum and crime. He said he believed weapons of mass destruction were becoming a new source of electoral anxiety. Yesterday's seminar, attended by British ministers and European intellectuals, developed many of the themes of political cabinets, especially the need for Labour in government to continue to communicate its values and head off the threat of a populist right. Policy Network is chaired by the former Northern Ireland secretary Peter Mandelson and has found a niche as an early interpreter of trends in European politics, including the disastrous consequences for the left of ignoring crime and asylum issues. Meanwhile, in the latest issue of Progressive Politics, the magazine of Policy Network, Antonio Vitorino, the European commissioner for home affairs, concedes illegal immigration is fostered by EU policy. He wrote: \"The way our administrations work makes it extremely difficult to send people away once they are in. So it pays to come in illegally.\" He addressed difficult issues for the centre left, arguing: \"I am not prepared to sacrifice religious freedom or equality between men and women on the altar of a multicultural society.\" He admitted that his attempt to forge a Europeanwide asylum policy was failing. \"Decision makers around European capitals should understand the dangers of pretending that we are making more progress than we are in this policy at European level,\" he wrote. \"If no action is taken, we shall help ignite the public's frustration, and fuel the extremist parties that have mushroomed in recent years.\" Writing in the same journal, the junior minister Douglas Alexander argued that the left must be clear about its values, as much as policy. \"The ability to define a clear narrative is a key test for incumbent parties,\" he wrote. \"It's clear that being in office should not stop us from campaigning, but all too often it does.\" He admitted that the European right had made progress by focusing on immigration as the foundation for its identity and was now looking at the EU as its next target. He wrote: \"We must let go of pocketbook politics - the belief popular in the 80s that voters only think through their wallets.\" Some of the themes will be developed today when two modernising public service ministers - the health secretary, Alan Milburn, and the education secretary, Charles Clarke - hold a rare joint press conference on the theme of choice in public services."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
