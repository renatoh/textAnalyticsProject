Hit has already accepted a 300p-a-share offer from Apax Partners, KKR's British rival, which values it at \u00a3489 million, but two north American trade buyers - Lions Gate Entertainment and Classic Media - have said they are considering making rival offers. KKR is backing the Lions Gate bid, according to media industry sources. The US film and television group, which produced Michael Moore's Iraq documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 , approached Apax earlier this year with a proposal to launch a joint bid, but Apax rebuffed the offer. Lions Gate, which also owns the TV rights to Barbie and the Incredible Hulk, is valued at just over \u00a31 billion, a similar size to Hit, and it would have to fund an offer with shares. Teaming up with KKR will enable it to add a cash element to the bid if it decides to table a formal offer, which would make it more appealing to Hit shareholders. They will vote on the Apax bid, which has been recommended by the Hit board, at a meeting on 28 April. Apax claims to have secured acceptances from investors controlling 35 per cent of the company's shares, but investors may be tempted to hold out for a higher offer from either of the rival bidders."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
