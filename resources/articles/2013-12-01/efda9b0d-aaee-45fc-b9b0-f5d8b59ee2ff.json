Barely a decade ago the 47-year-old divorcee had moved in with a new girlfriend, drove a Porsche and took lucrative posts in e-commerce where pay deals were sweetened by corporate perks such as free housing. But Perfitt led a double life. He did not earn money to build a better life but instead used it to feed a gambling addiction to bookmakers' betting terminals. His cravings saw him lose not only his relationship but left him homeless and facing personal ruin after pouring, he says, \u00a3200,000 into the machines. Fixed odds betting terminals (FOBTs), which offer high-stakes, high-speed casino games such as roulette, were dubbed the \"crack cocaine of gambling\" almost the day they arrived in Britain. Solitary, uninterrupted machine play, it was claimed, produced a trance-like state, not dissimilar to that experienced by a drug addict. According to researchers while the number of people addicted to the gambling represents only 1% of the total number of gamblers, such is the extent of their habit that they contribute up to 50% of industry betting revenue. Now clean for more than a year, the computer programmer says there are parallels with drug taking. While gambling heavily Perfitt would become irrational \u2013 parking only in certain places because he believed that would affect the outcomes of his bets or staking hundreds of pounds on the table number he'd eaten breakfast at that morning. Such was his fixation that he stopped buying clothes or going on holiday and only ate the cheapest food. He became \"emotionally inert\" and lost a succession of high-paying jobs, because \"work was getting in the way of his gambling\". He admits \"crossing a line\" when he forced his girlfriend to pay him \u00a35,000 to leave their flat after their relationship collapsed under the strain. \"I blackmailed her. Probably the worst thing I have ever done in my life. I put pressure on her just to get more money to gamble. I think that probably was the point when I crossed a moral boundary. I needed to get some treatment and stop. Because what was the next thing? Rob a bank?\" It took another 18 months before he entered treatment, such was the pull of the FOBTs. Perfitt checked himself into a tough cold turkey regime run by the charity Gordon Moody in Dudley. \"I had to have five teeth taken out. You see I'd stopped brushing my teeth. I'd had bad toothache for five years but I just took lots of ibuprofen\". Although he overcame his gambling addiction partly through the act of confessing it, the spell the machines cast over Perfitt has yet to be fully broken. He can no longer work in IT or return to his home town of Cambridge \u2013 when he has done so he's simply relapsed into playing the machines. Instead he lives on benefits in sheltered housing in Dudley and volunteers at the charity which \"saved his life\". Perfitt says FOBTs are so dangerous that they should be banned from the high street. The terminals have been under mounting scrutiny in recent months \u2013 and linked to crime and poverty. Last night three councils \u2013 Tory-controlled Fareham, Green-dominated Brighton and Labour-run Preston \u2013 all voted in favour of restricting FOBTs. Tom Watson, former Labour party chair who has campaigned on the issue, told the Guardian that he would be tabling an early day motion on Monday seeking MPs' support to amend gambling legislation to allow local authorities to block betting shop applications. \"These machines are a haven for problem gamblers and a magnet for crime. If central government won't move quickly then they should give powers to local government to deal with the crisis.\" Despite the political backlash, Britain's 33,000 machines are increasingly important to the bookmaking industry, raking in \u00a31.5bn a year in profit. The rise of the machines, many claim, has stifled debate about their social costs. Because charities and academics are forced to look to the industry to fund treatment and research, experts are unwilling to say FOBTs are the root cause of the rise in problem gambling. Perfitt points out that when the charity asked him for testimony about his experiences to use in their annual report, his references to FOBTs were removed. He said: \"Anyone in receipt of funding does not want to make too much fuss about FOBTs because they are scared of losing their funding\". When contacted Gordon Moody said it concentrated on the \"underlying causes of gambling addiction\" rather than looking at which form of gambling people are addicted to. Similarly, critics point out that last week the Responsible Gambling Trust (RGT), a charity funded through industry donations, published research into gaming machines which did not examine FOBTs because \"no bookmaker volunteered a betting shop for research\". This concerns some as ministers have said they will wait for the conclusion of research by the trust before considering a reduction in maximum stake on FOBTs from \u00a3100, which can currently be wagered every 20 seconds. What is clear is that compared to Australia or North America there's a paucity of research into the effects and size of problem gambling. In London his week, the RGT held the first UK conference into the harm caused by betting. Since Labour liberalised gaming laws in 2005, Britain had seen a sharp rise in problem gambling \u2013 with 451,000 people described as such in the last survey, representing 0.9% of the adult population. Robert Williams, professor of gaming research at the University of Lethbridge in Canada, said this 1.2% of gamblers, \"the problem gamblers, contribute between 20 and 50% of all industry revenues. But in Canada we know that a quarter of personal bankruptcies are related to problem gambling. And that a tenth of all suicides are related to problem gambling. These are real costs.\" Matt Zarb-Cousin, a reformed problem gambler now of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, said: \"FOBTs are the most addictive form of gambling, and you have to question why casino gaming machines are allowed on the high street. There is still a huge stigma with gambling addiction, so we're unaware of the real extent of the problem.\" The industry denied claims it had \"stifled research\". A spokesman for the Association of British Bookmakers said: \"We are not complacent and do acknowledge that some customers have problems with gaming machines\" but added: \"The truth is that those customers experiencing problems will gamble on a variety of different products, from casino table games to scratch cards.\" Perfitt \u2013 the addict turned whistleblower \u2013 remains unconvinced by the industry claims, saying that he is trying to come to terms with losing touch with reality for almost a decade. Addicts always thought they would repeat the unrepeatable \u2013 and beat the house again and again. \"You don't keep track and there's an element of self deception. You just remember the wins and forget the losses.\" \u2022 This article was amended on 16 December 2013. An earlier version said problem gamblers represented 0.9% of all gamblers. That has been corrected to 0.9% of the adult population."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
