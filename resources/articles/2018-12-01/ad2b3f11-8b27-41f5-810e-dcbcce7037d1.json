Colin Graves, the chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, led the praise for Cook after the 34-year-old became the 11th Englishman to be knighted for services to cricket. The batsman, who retired from the international game this year, is England\u2019s all-time leading run-scorer with 12,472 runs \u2013 and the fifth-highest run-scorer in the history of the men\u2019s Test game. He scored the last of his 33 Test hundreds in his final Test innings at the Oval in the summer. \u201cI\u2019m delighted that he has received this honour,\u201d Graves said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fitting tribute to a man who has led with distinction on and off the pitch ever since he made his England debut.\u201d Bill Beaumont, the former England rugby union captain, received a knighthood. The 66-year-old led England to a Five Nations Grand Slam in 1980 and also captained the British and Irish Lions. He is a former Rugby Football Union chairman and was elected chairman of World Rugby in 2016. \u201cI have always viewed my work in the sport as an administrator as that of a guardian, driven by a passion to do the very best I can for rugby,\u201d Beaumont said. England\u2019s football manager, Gareth Southgate, received an OBE after his team\u2019s run to last summer\u2019s World Cup semi-finals. Harry Kane, who won the tournament\u2019s golden boot for top scorer, earned an MBE. Geraint Thomas added another accolade to his glittering 2018 after receiving an OBE. The cyclist had already been named the BBC Sports Personality of the Year after winning the Tour de France in July. \u201cThis is an amazing honour,\u201d the Welshman said. Enid Bakewell, a legendary figure in women\u2019s cricket, received an MBE. There was also a CBE for Geva Mentor, who helped England win netball gold at the Commonwealth Games on Queensland\u2019s Gold Coast this year. Paula Dunn, the Paralympic head coach, was made an MBE. Frances Houghton, the longest serving member of the GB rowing team, received an MBE, as did Helen Jenkins, the triathlete and 2008 and 2011 ITU world champion. Joanna Bostock, the co-founder of the Women\u2019s Sport Trust, received an MBE in recognition of her services to gender equality in sport. Richard Scudamore, the outgoing chief executive of the Premier League, was made a CBE. Leroy Rosenior, the vice-president of Show Racism the Red Card, was awarded an MBE for services to tackling discrimination in sport. The broadcaster Gary Newbon received an MBE for services to the media, sport and charity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
