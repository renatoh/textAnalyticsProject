Possible targets include St Peter\u2019s Basilica in Rome \u2013 the world famous church at the heart of the Vatican \u2013 and two sites in Milan: the city\u2019s main cathedral and La Scala opera house. \u201cAs of yesterday our security forces are working to identify five people,\u201d Gentiloni said in an interview with state broadcaster RAI. Italy has already raised its security level in the wake of Friday\u2019s terror attacks in Paris, in which 129 people were killed. But on Thursday Gentiloni pointed to a more specific possible threat after being alerted to five alleged suspects by the FBI in the US. The FBI gave Italy the names of \u201cfive Arab individuals who could be in Italy and should be searched for\u201d, according to the Ansa news agency. The US embassy in Rome did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Gentiloni stressed that the US embassy was alerting tourists visiting Italy to be vigilant in public spaces, but it was not a warning that they should avoid the country altogether. Gentiloni also stressed that Italians could not be \u201cprisoners\u201d of the terror alert. The warning comes just three weeks before Rome is expected to welcome an estimated 33 million pilgrims and tourists to the city to celebrate the pope\u2019s year of mercy, also known as the jubilee, which begins on 8 December."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
