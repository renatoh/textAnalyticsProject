While Djokovic, Nadal and Federer share 52 major titles between them, three of the four remaining women have never even played in a slam semi before. It puts Johanna Konta, who didn\u2019t have a single match win to her name at the French Open before this year, as the most experienced of the semi-finalists. The Big Three aren\u2019t budging \u2013 but once again change is abound in the women\u2019s game. Thanks for your company today, do join me again tomorrow for Djokovic v Thiem, Federer v Nadal, Konta v Vondrousova and Barty v Anisimova. Bye! Zverev perhaps should have pushed Djokovic closer; he had his chances. He\u2019ll perhaps be criticised for the way he fell away \u2013 for all the talk of him as a future grand slam champion he\u2019s yet to produce an eye-catching performance against one of the top players on the biggest stage \u2013 but Djokovic is the master in grinding his opponents down mentally. Djokovic v Thiem should be some match tomorrow. \u201cHe has a very strong serve so that was a big challenge for me to find a good position to return,\u201d Djokovic says. \u201cI played five or six games perfectly. I started hitting the ball a bit more cleanly. It\u2019s good to finish today after the rain yesterday. It\u2019s important to focus on the present moment without thinking about the next day. I\u2019m in the semi-finals and I\u2019m very happy with that. I hope I will continue to play well.\u201d Zverev\u2019s dad appears to have had enough; he\u2019s getting ready to leave the stands. Zverev\u2019s coach, Ivan Lendl, hasn\u2019t been in Paris this fortnight by the way. Zverev says the man who guided Andy Murray to his grand slam titles will be back for the grass-court season but there are rumours the pair could be going their separate ways. But I digress. Djokovic charges to 40-15, two match points. And he takes it on the second when Zverev balloons a backhand long! Djokovic is through to the semi-finals and is only two wins away from completing his second Novak slam by holding all four majors at the same time. Djokovic still hasn\u2019t dropped a set but will surely face a tougher challenge tomorrow against Thiem, who has beaten (an admittedly out-of-form) Djokovic at Roland Garros before, in straight sets in the 2017 quarter-finals. With nothing to lose, Zverev zips to 15-40 on Djokovic\u2019s serve. Two break points. There\u2019s nothing giving on the first. And on the second he shows hands of lead on an attempted drop-shot. Deuce. Advantage Djokovic. Game Djokovic. Zverev\u2019s had his chances in the match but is now one from six on break points and Djokovic will serve for a place in yet another grand slam semi-final, leading 7-5, 6-2, 5-2. Zverev is clinging on to this quarter-final with his fingertips, trailing 7-5, 6-2, 3-2 and 15-30 on serve. An ace will make him feel a little better. 30-all. But he then inexplicably misses a backhand drive volley! That was ugly. 30-40. As is his netted forehand volley on the next point. Zverev has surely let go of this match. Djokovic has the break in the third set. Thiem\u2019s beaming on Suzanne Lenglen, where he\u2019s completed a straightforward straight-sets victory over Khachanov, neutralising the Russian\u2019s power with ease to advance 6-2, 6-4, 6-2. The Austrian - who\u2019s beaten Djokovic and Nadal on clay before \u2013 is through to the last four for the fourth consecutive year. He\u2019s such an impressive performer at Roland Garros but defeating most likely Djokovic in the semi-finals and then Nadal in the final in back-to-back best-of-five matches is such a tough ask. Djokovic should be feeling pretty pleased with himself right now, leading 7-5, 6-2, 1-0, but here\u2019s the niggly Novak, drawing a few boos as he slams his racket into the clay. Zverev did so a few points ago too. Djokovic\u2019s racket is broken but there\u2019s no warning from the umpire. Zverev holds to 15. It\u2019s 7-5, 6-2, 1-1. Thiem\u2019s calmly working his way past Khachanov; the unassuming Austrian who could one day be king here (is this year still too soon given Djokovic\u2019s form and Nadal\u2019s pedigree in Paris?) leads 6-2, 6-4, 4-2. So it\u2019s looking as if it\u2019ll be Djokovic v Thiem tomorrow, after Federer v Nadal, meaning the top four seeds will have made the Roland Garros semi-finals for the first time since 2011. Remarkably it\u2019s almost the same lineup, with Thiem taking Andy Murray\u2019s place. Zverev steps up to serve, knowing he must hold to stop Djokovic from taking a surely insurmountable two sets to love lead. Zverev\u2019s never won from two sets down in his career and few would fancy him changing that record against the world No 1. Zverev\u2019s on the ropes at 30-40; he steadies himself for deuce and his advantage, but two points \u2013 and two double faults \u2013 later it\u2019s another set point for Djokovic. And Zverev concedes the set just as he did the first, with another double fault. To borrow and tweak a quote: to lose one set in that manner may be regarded as a misfortune, to lose both looks like carelessness. There\u2019s a collective gasp around Philippe Chatrier. Djokovic doesn\u2019t have it all his own way in the seventh game of the second set, he\u2019s made to work for the hold, which he eventually does from 0-30 down and then deuce. 5-2. Djokovic holds for 4-1. As does Zverev for 4-2, sending down his sixth ace of the day. At least Zverev leads Djokovic on one front today; Djokovic hasn\u2019t served any yet. Meanwhile Thiem is well on course for a fourth consecutive French Open semi-final. He\u2019s taken the second set 6-4 against Khachanov, breaking the Russian in the ninth game before serving it out. That feared forehand of Khachanov\u2019s just hasn\u2019t got going. This is such a typical performance by Djokovic; laughing in the face of adversity towards the end of the first set before tearing his opponent to pieces. Zverev is lying on the red dirt after the fifth point of his service game when he tumbles trying to retrieve a drop-shot. 30-40. Djokovic has the chance for a double break. But Superman shows he\u2019s can be human sometimes. Deuce. Advantage Zverev. Game Zverev, as he hangs in during a lengthy exchange before Djokovic\u2019s drop-shot slumps into the net. Zverev has won his first game in seven but trails 7-5, 3-1. Make that 12 to one. Djokovic holds to love for 7-5, 3-0. Meanwhile something\u2019s got to give between Thiem and Khachanov in the second set. It\u2019s 4-4, 30-all. A relentless Djokovic secures his fourth game on the spin, opening the second set with a love hold. Zverev appears absolutly deflated. At 15-30 Zverev has one, two, three chances to scramble to 30-all but Djokovic\u2019s defence is impenetrable. It\u2019s 15-40, two break points, and Zverev surrenders meekly with a double fault, just as he did at the end of the first set. From being two points away from losing the first set, Djokovic could run away with this, unless Zverev refocuses. It\u2019s 7-5, 2-0. Djokovic has won eight points to Zverev\u2019s one in this set. A big serve from Zverev but it matters not to Djokovic; the best returner in the business gets it back with ease for 15-all. Make that 15-30, 15-40, two set points. Zverev has played so well in this first set, served for it at 5-4 and was two points away, but now Djokovic is one point from stealing it. A big one-two punch from Zverev and even Djokovic can\u2019t absorb that. 30-40. Zverev shows some guts to step forward and knife a backhand volley for deuce. The German nibbles his necklace and pumps his fists. Gutsy. But blinded by the sun Zverev undoes his good work. Advantage Djokovic, a third set point. Zverev misses with his first serve ... and nets the second! An inauspicious end to what had been an excellent set from Zverev, who\u2019ll feel he should be leading this match. And Djokovic doesn\u2019t lose too many contests after taking the first set. How will Zverev respond? Both players are sucking for air; they\u2019re working each other hard out there. But Djokovic can breathe a little easier when he holds to 15 for 6-5. Beware a wounded Djokovic. He somehow gets his return back at 30-all and goes on to win the point, getting a chance to break back at the first opportunity. 30-40. Zverev\u2019s shot loops way beyond the baseline and Djokovic has muscled his way back into this first set. It\u2019s 5-5. And you wouldn\u2019t bet against the world No 1 going for the jugular from here. The crowd sound slightly deflated; they wanted the underdog to serve it out. Has he missed his chance? Given the amount Djokovic is already bouncing the ball before serving, he knows he\u2019s in a real contest. Zverev is again probing, at 0-15, 15-30 and then 30-40. This is Zverev\u2019s fourth break point; Djokovic hasn\u2019t had any. The pair embark on a tentative exchange, neither appear prepared to concede though neither appear ready to pull the trigger, and Djokovic eventually makes the error! There\u2019s the first break of the quarter-final, and it\u2019s no less than Zverev deserves. The German leads 5-4 and will serve for the first set! What of Djokovic and Zverev, you say? Zverev holds. 3-3. Djokovic enjoys his easiest hold. 4-3. Zverev holds. 4-4. Given the way Zverev is playing, he\u2019ll be crushed if he doesn\u2019t take this first set. You feel it\u2019s far more important for him to win than Djokovic. Zverev had already lost 10 matches this year coming into Roland Garros and did not appear to be in the form to go deep in the tournament. But he\u2019s oozing confidence here, with a comfortable hold for 3-3. Thiem meanwhile is running away with the first set against Khachanov. He\u2019s serving for it at 5-2, leading 30-15. Thiem brings up two set points in style with a fizzing winner \u2013 he\u2019s more than matching Khachanov\u2019s feared forehand right now. The first set point comes and goes but Thiem somehow pings away another forehand winner \u2013 the apology suggests he didn\u2019t quite mean it \u2013 but I\u2019m sure he\u2019s not too sorry; he\u2019s got the first set on the board, 6-2. Djokovic was 0-30 down in his first service game, 15-40 down in his second and he\u2019s 0-30 down here. But again Zverev can\u2019t seem to take advantage. A deft drop-shot from Djokovic and it\u2019s 30-all. But look, it\u2019s 30-40 when Zverev sets up the point and settles it with the smash. A third break point of the match for the challenger. He goes for the backhand winner and misses. Deuce. Djokovic is having to work so hard to win the points, he\u2019s already grunting so loudly as he grinds his way through the longest rally of the match, more than 20 shots. Advantage Djokovic. Jeu Djokovic. 3-2. Thiem\u2019s taking little time on Suzanne Lenglen. He\u2019s broken Khachanov for 2-1 and is serving at 30-15, which three points later becomes game. The fourth seed has made an assured start to lead the 10th seed 3-1. Zverev has a spring in his step after unleashing a winner for 15-40, two break points. He\u2019s clearly enjoying his status as the underdog; there\u2019s little pressure on him this afternoon. Despite his supreme talent he\u2019s not expected to beat the 15-times slam champion in only his second major quarter-final. Under pressure from Djokovic, an attempted drop-shot from Zverev bounces before even reaching his own side of the net. 30-40. Zverev spots his chance down the line but it misses by a few grains of clay. The umpire, James Keothavong, is out of his chair to check \u2013 of course controversially there\u2019s no Hawk-Eye at the French Open \u2013 and confirms the call. Deuce. And from there Djokovic does what Djokovic does, dismissing any danger to hold for 2-1. Djokovic is bounce, bounce, bouncing the ball so that can only mean one thing: mesdames et messieurs, play is under way and Monsieur Djokovic will serve first. A good hold for the world No 1 and 2016 champion from 0-30 down. He\u2019s 30-0 behind on Zverev\u2019s serve too, before scrambling to 30-all. But two zipping Zverev first serves and that\u2019s the game. It\u2019s 1-1. Khachanov meanwhile is taken to three deuces by Thiem but holds for 1-0. As for Thiem v Khachanov, Thiem is the best-placed player behind Djokovic and Rafa Nadal to win here. There\u2019s so much to like about the Austrian, who reached the final last year having made the semis in 2016 and 2017, but it\u2019s fair to say that Whoopi Goldberg isn\u2019t one of his greatest fans. Thiem will need to be on his guard against Khachanov, the 23-year-old Russian, who can knock opponents\u2019 heads off with his serve and forehand. Djokovic, who\u2019s looking to complete his second Novak slam having also held all four majors in 2015-16, has been beating up his opponents so far, and hasn\u2019t come close to losing a set. Zverev has encountered more resistance, and needed two five-setters to survive the first week, but the fifth seed did have a good win over the dangerous Fabio Fognini on Monday in the last 16. Of course Djokovic is the favourite for this quarter-final but Zverev could give him a match. I\u2019m back. And here\u2019s Alex Zverev, the 6ft 6in German doing his best not to hit his head as he weaves and winds his way through the corridors before being announced to the Philippe Chatrier crowd, moments before Novak Djokovic makes his entrance. After Wednesday\u2019s washout they step on to a court bathed in brilliant sunshine. Meanwhile over on Suzanne Lenglen it\u2019s Dominic Thiem v Karen Khachanov. I\u2019m off to get some lunch before the men\u2019s quarter-finals in 40 minutes or so. I\u2019ll leave you with Kevin Mitchell\u2019s report. See you in a bit ... \u201cIt\u2019s been such an amazing tournament but I\u2019m calling it now: Anisimova v Vondrousova in the final!\u201d emails the not-very-patriotic Sam Rajasingham. \u201cI know I should be cheering for Konta but gosh, these are two very poised tennis teenagers. So exciting.\u201d Confirmation of tomorrow\u2019s semi-final schedule: Lenglen 10am BST/11am local time Barty v Anisimova Mathieu 10am BST/11am local time Konta v Vondrousova Chatrier 11.50am BST/12.50pm local time Federer v Nadal Djokovic or Zverev v Thiem or Khachanov Thoughts: it\u2019s good the women\u2019s semi-finals are being played at the same, considering the quick turnaround before the final on Saturday. However it\u2019s a shame they\u2019re not getting their moment on Chatrier, which will host only the men\u2019s matches. Anisimova now knows she\u2019ll face Ashleigh Barty tomorrow. They\u2019ll both be playing in their first grand slam semi-final, and Halep\u2019s defeat means we\u2019re guaranteed another first-time women\u2019s major winner on Saturday. It\u2019s been a whole two slams since we\u2019ve had one ... And you\u2019d have to say Johanna Konta, who plays Marketa Vondrousova in the bottom half tomorrow, will never have a better chance to win one of the game\u2019s biggest prizes. She\u2019s the only semi-finalist to have reached the last four at a slam before. As for Barty, she recovered from the disappointment of being broken when she was serving for the match at 5-4, breaking Keys for 6-5 and holding to love to settle matters emphatically. \u201cShe\u2019s been playing some amazing tennis, an amazing match today,\u201d Barty says of Anisimova. \u201cIt\u2019s an exciting match for both of us.\u201d Whoever reaches the final it\u2019ll be quite some story. The multi-talented Barty spent a couple of years playing cricket before returning to tennis in 2016. Anisimova speaks. She sounds so mature for a 17-year-old. Chris Evert likens the American to Maria Sharapova when she broke through at Wimbledon in 2004. \u201cI\u2019ve been working very hard but I never thought it would pay off like this,\u201d Anisimova says. \u201cThis is more than I could ask for. This is one of the best matches I\u2019ve ever played.\u201d You\u2019d think Anisimova\u2019s racket would be feeling as if it weighs 100kg right now as she ponders the magnitude of reaching the French Open semi-finals, but the teenager shows the lightest of touches with a cute drop-shot to immediately put Halep on the back foot. At 30-all, Halep double faults! Match point. And Anisimova attacks the defending champion once again \u2013 sealing a sensational win with yet another backhand winner! Halep\u2019s reign at Roland Garros is over. Halep holds for 4-4. That\u2019s three consecutive games now. She\u2019s doing a better job of moving the big-hitting Anisimova around and using the angles. Halep is probing again on Anisimova\u2019s serve and has a break point for 5-4. But it\u2019s not to be four games in a row. Anisimova frees herself from Halep\u2019s grip and steadies herself for 5-4. Halep must hold serve to stay in this quarter-final. Let\u2019s cross over to Suzanne Lenglen though, where Barty is close to quietly sealing a no-nonsense victory \u2013 as is the likeable Australian\u2019s style. She leads 6-3, 5-3 \u2013 make that 5-4 as Keys holds to force Barty to serve this out. The nerves are jangling for Barty at 15-all when she throws in her first double fault of the day. But she settles them by prevailing in a game of cat and mouse for 30-all. Keys has Barty on the backfoot on the fifth point with a fizzing return, Barty stays in the point before eventually prodding long. 30-40, break point. And Keys breaks! They\u2019re back on serve at 5-5. As Chris Evert, the seven-times French Open champion and the best clay-court player in the history of the women\u2019s game, points out on Eurosport, it\u2019s one thing forging a lead such as this against a player of Halep\u2019s stature, but it\u2019s quite another closing it out. Let\u2019s see what Anisimova is made of. Halep holds; and Anisimova is left shrugging her shoulders as Halep gets herself two break points at 15-40. A quick flick of the wrists from Anisimova and a wonderful angled backhand cross-court winner saves the first. Halep\u2019s only two out of six on break points. But make that three out of seven. Halep strikes back. They\u2019re back on serve, with Halep 6-2, 4-3 down but very much holding the momentum. Halep bludgeons a backhand winner \u2013 only her second of the day \u2013 to get to break point on Anisimova\u2019s serve. That\u2019ll have felt good. But advantage Halep becomes deuce. From there Anisimova should really get to her advantage but makes the error. The American lets out a high-pitched squeal in frustration; finally we\u2019re given a reminder that this player who\u2019s bossing the defending champion is only 17 years of age. Again, advantage Halep turns into deuce. Then it\u2019s Anisimova\u2019s advantage; she sends Halep one way and t\u2019other, forward and back, and eventually Halep\u2019s defence breaks down! Anisimova remains in the ascendancy, leading 6-2, 4-1. Meanwhile it\u2019s all-square between Barty and Keys in the second, with Barty leading 6-3, 3-3. Apologies. Technical issues here. No such problems for Anisimova though, who has taken her seventh - yes, seventh - game in a row for 6-2, 3-0 after only 37 minutes. The Philippe Chatrier spectators are sitting in stunned silence. You wouldn\u2019t blame Halep for doing so as well, but she finally rouses herself to hold and stop the rot for 3-1. Barty, having blown those two set points and another at her advantage, finally settles matters on her fourth. So it\u2019s Barty and Anisimova currently on course to meet in the semi-finals. No such problems for Anisimova though, who\u2019s decided she doesn\u2019t really want to wait to serve out the first set against Halep. Instead she hurtles to 0-40 on Halep\u2019s serve ... and takes the set on a draining third set point! Wow. What a statement from the 17-year-old, who\u2019s showing her more esteemed opponent absolutely no respect. Over on Suzanne Lenglen, meanwhile, Barty is serving for the first set at 5-3 against Keys, who clunks a backhand into the net to give the Australian two set points at 40-15. A serve out wide from Barty ... she then sends Keys to the other side of the court ... but goes on to make the error. 40-30. On the second set point Barty balloons a backhand wide! She\u2019s hit a third of her unforced errors in the past two points. A big game for Anisimova. Will she consolidate the break for 5-2, or will she let Halep back into the set? She looks set fair at 40-15 but Halep chips, chips, chips away for 40-30, deuce and then advantage ... before undoing her good work with a tight return. Deuce. Advantage Anisimova. Game Anisimova for 5-2, having survived the break point. The fearlessness of youth, eh? Anisimova\u2019s backhand is a real weapon and it sets up the third point for her. 15-30. A first double fault from Halep and it\u2019s 15-40. The first break points of the match. Halep lets out a huge UGGGGGH before unleashing a forehand down the line ... but it\u2019s long! Anisimova, the world No 51, has the first break of the match against the defending champion! It\u2019s 4-2. You have to admire Anisimova\u2019s assured approach here; you\u2019d think she was older than her 17 years the way she\u2019s dealing with the occasion. She\u2019s conceded very few unforced errors so far \u2013 but then as I type that two on the spin allow Halep to hold. The commentator\u2019s curser strikes early. But Anisimova regroups immediately, charging through her serve to 15. It\u2019s 3-2 Anisimova and 3-2 Barty. There\u2019s nothing giving on serve yet. Anisimova holds for 2-1, as does Barty. Meanwhile a French lesson from Owen Dakin: \u201cYesterday \u2018il a plu\u2019 or \u2018il plut\u2019. The imperfect \u2018il pleuvait\u2019 is used as in \u2018it was raining when...\u2019 or \u2018as it was raining...\u2019\u201d Gah. Damn Google Translate. Maybe I\u2019ll stick to Anglais from now on. Halep is looking to assert her authority from the start. The Romanian gets to deuce on Anisimova\u2019s serve \u2013 she\u2019s won 16 CONSECUTIVE return games coming into the match \u2013 but two slaps into the net mean the run will not be extended. Anisimova, by the way, is the first player born in the 2000s, male or female, to be playing in a slam quarter-final. The 17-year-old American\u2019s also the youngest player in the women\u2019s top 100. She\u2019s chasing shadows as Halep holds serve for 1-1, which is also the score in Keys v Barty. It\u2019s tough to know which match to focus on here. Halep is, of course, the defending champion and highest-profile player left in the women\u2019s draw, while Keys v Barty could prove to be the better contest. It\u2019s an intriguing match-up between last year\u2019s semi-finalist who goes for all-out power and the popular Australian Barty, whose bag of tricks means she can mix the play up so well. I think I need four hands and 16 fingers to cover these quarter-finals. Here they come, Simona Halep and Amanda Anisimova on Philippe Chatrier, and Madison Keys and Ashleigh Barty on Suzanne Lenglen. The Parisian patrons don\u2019t seem too impressed with the early start; there\u2019s only a smattering of spectators in the stands. There\u2019s been a very brief rain shower but the forecast for the rest of the day is pretty good. While we wait for the players to step on to court: Court Philippe Chatrier 11am BST/12pm local time Simona HALEP (ROU) [3] v Amanda ANISIMOVA (USA) Not before 1.30pm BST/2.30pm local time Novak DJOKOVIC (SRB) [1] v Alexander ZVEREV (GER) [5] Jeremy CHARDY and Fabrice MARTIN (FRA) v Juan Sebastian CABAL and Robert FARAH (COL) [3] Court Suzanne Lenglen 11am BST/12pm local time Madison KEYS (USA) [14] v Ashleigh BARTY (AUS) [8] Not before 1.30pm BST/2.30pm local time Dominic THIEM (AUT) [4] v Karen KHACHANOV (RUS) [10] Kevin KRAWIETZ and Andreas MIES (GER) v Guido PELLA and Diego SCHWARTZMAN (ARG) Court Simonne Mathieu Not before 11am BST/12pm local time Nicole MELICHAR (USA) and Bruno SOARES (BRA) [1] v Latisha CHAN (TPE) and Ivan DODIG (CRO) Elise MERTENS (BEL) and Aryna SABALENKA (BLR) [6] v Lyudmyla KICHENOK (UKR) and Jelena OSTAPENKO (LAT) Court 1 Nadiia KICHENOK (UKR) and Aisam-ul-haq QURESHI (PAK) v Gabriela DABROWSKI (CAN) and Mate PAVIC (CRO) [2] Yesterday il pleuvait. Beaucoup. So today is a rollover of the four remaining quarter-finals: Simona Halep v Amanda Anisimova, Madison Keys v Ashleigh Barty, Novak Djokovic v Alex Zverev and Dominic Thiem v Karen Khachanov. The women\u2019s semi-finals, including Johanna Konta\u2019s match with Marketa Vondrousova, have been pushed back until tomorrow, when they\u2019ll share a packed schedule with the men\u2019s last four, including Rafa v Roger XXXIX. If the weather holds for the rest of the week, the woman emerging from the top half of the draw faces three matches in three days to win the title, which is perhaps not a significant disadvantage given they\u2019re used to playing best-of-three-set matches in consecutive days on the WTA Tour. But on the men\u2019s side it means three best-of-five matches in four days, which is not something that happens too often. Advantage Monsieur Nadal over Monsieur Djokovic? Peut-\u00eatre.
