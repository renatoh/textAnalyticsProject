The narrative would surely be different had Trump lost in the resounding landslide foreseen by professional pundits and pollsters. In that universe, the president and everything he represents would have been repudiated, creating an immense temptation for the Republican party to revert back to its lily-white, elite-driven comfort zone. Instead, Trump defied expectations by winning the largest share of non-white voters of any Republican since 1960. This ranged from modest gains among African American men, to major swings in party preference within working-class Latino communities \u2013 and not just in Miami-Dade, where Cuban-American turnout helped secure Florida for Trump while unseating two Democratic incumbents. In Starr county, Texas, for example, Biden beat Trump by five points down from Hillary Clinton\u2019s 60 \u2013 a 55-point swing in a border town that\u2019s 95% Hispanic and which has a median income of only $17,000. The Missouri senator Josh Hawley, a rising star within the GOP\u2019s populist faction, was quick to offer his interpretation on Twitter. \u201cRepublicans in Washington are going to have a very hard time processing this,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut the future is clear: we must be a working class party, not a Wall Street party.\u201d The Florida senator Marco Rubio concurred. \u201c#Florida &amp; the Rio Grande Valley showed the future of the GOP: A party built on a multi-ethnic multi-racial coalition of working AMERICANS.\u201d Ironically enough, the primary demographic Trump lost relative to 2016 was non-college-educated white men. A key factor seems to have been the Biden campaign\u2019s strategic positioning on issues that resonate with rust belt voters \u2013 from a \u201cBuy America\u201d plan so supercharged that it made Steve Bannon blush, to tax incentives for manufacturers that reshore. Thus even in defeat, the ideas behind Trumpism were on some level victorious. All that said, the gap between Trumpism in theory and practice remains enormous. Despite campaigning on a rejection of conservative economic orthodoxies in 2016, once in office Trump pursued an agenda of tax cuts and deregulation that was almost comically conventional. And by the final days of the 2020 campaign, Trump scarcely talked about policy at all, much less his core issues of trade and immigration. Trump\u2019s narrow loss thus marks the beginning of an internal struggle for the soul of American conservatism. Many in the Republican party long for a return to the socially moderate, fiscal conservatism of a bygone era. Others, like Hawley and Rubio, are calling upon their peers to embrace the working-class realignment that Trump grasped at an intuitive level, even as he failed in execution. Between deindustrialization and the steady exodus of college-educated voters to the Democratic party, the Republican party\u2019s shift toward the working class has been decades in the making. A similar trend can be seen elsewhere, too, from Boris Johnson\u2019s blue-collar supporters, to the unabashedly pro-union platform of Erin O\u2019Toole, the newly minted leader of the Conservative party of Canada. The main difference in the US case has been the failure, if not outright resistance, of the Republican party\u2019s political machinery to adapt in real time. Indeed, for all of Trump\u2019s capacity for disruption, he was no match against the institutional edifice of the so-called \u201cconservative movement\u201d \u2013 the dozens of free-market thinktanks, law firms and leadership organizations that were called upon to staff his administration and define his agenda. So while the notion of the Republican party becoming a multiethnic working-class coalition may seem farcical now, the longer-term trend speaks for itself. The only question is whether the party\u2019s elite will continue to deny this reality, or take the next four years to rebuild and realign conservative institutions to better reflect the actual interests of their rank and file.
