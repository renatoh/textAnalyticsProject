An officer from the Fullerton police department shot Hannah Williams around 7pm on Friday less than two miles from her home in Anaheim, about 25 miles south of Los Angeles. Authorities on Tuesday declined to say what happened prior to the shooting or why the officer fired at her, but claimed that a \u201creplica gun\u201d was \u201crecovered at the scene\u201d. Representatives for the family of Williams said the teenager did not pose a threat, that the police had given them no information about finding a toy gun, and that law enforcement was disparaging her in the media. Williams\u2019 family gathered outside Anaheim city hall on Tuesday, some of them too distraught to speak, as Williams\u2019 godmother, Lanette Campbell, read a statement. \u201cHannah was a beloved daughter, sister, niece, granddaughter, friend. She had her whole life ahead of her. We\u2019re seeking answers as to truly what occurred,\u201d said Campbell, noting that Williams was dedicated to community service and volunteering. When some reporters shouted questions at the family about the replica weapon police claimed to have found, Campbell said: \u201cYou have more information than we do.\u201d The Rev Jarrett Maupin, a family spokesman, said it was unclear if the replica even belonged to her, adding: \u201cShe was unarmed. A fake gun is a fake gun.\u201d \u201cWe want the public to know, right away, how many times our daughter was shot and whether or not she was shot in the back. Why, Lord?\u201d said Hannah\u2019s father, Benson Williams, in a statement shared with the Guardian. \u201cWe want to know why police felt the need to shoot and kill a 17-year-old unarmed teen girl,\u201d he added. The shooting is under investigation by both Anaheim and Fullerton police departments as well as the Orange county district attorney\u2019s office. Williams\u2019 family has called for the police involved to be suspended without pay and has demanded that officials clarify the circumstances of the shooting. The Orange county district attorney\u2019s office said Tuesday that the Fullerton officer was on-duty and in uniform and was driving on the freeway when he observed the 17-year-old driving at a \u201chigh rate of speed\u201d, adding: \u201cAt some point, the two vehicles made physical contact.\u201d The office did not provide details on the nature of the contact and has not alleged that she was holding the replica or pointing it. A local highway was closed for hours after the shooting, Anaheim police said in a statement on Friday, thanking local highway patrol for \u201chelping with the mess on the freeway\u201d. The statement described Williams as a \u201cfemale suspect\u201d and said she died at a hospital. The Anaheim police department initially said that its officers recovered an \u201citem appearing to be a handgun\u201d, but could not provide more details until it was examined forensically. The Anaheim police department\u2019s role is to \u201cinvestigate any criminal actions\u201d by Williams, Sgt Daron Wyatt told the Guardian in an email on Tuesday morning. \u201cSince she is deceased, it is a moot point,\u201d he added. Wyatt said he had no further updates, since \u201cthe interview of the involved officer hasn\u2019t taken place yet\u201d. It\u2019s unclear why the officer had not yet been questioned four days after the killing. Wyatt did not respond to questions about what was recovered on the scene, and Fullerton police did not respond to an inquiry. A spokesperson from the Orange county district attorney said the replica gun was \u201cfound near her\u201d, but declined to comment further. Williams was working as a lifeguard at Knott\u2019s Berry Farm, a popular theme park in the region, and was enrolled in online classes this summer, according to Maupin. \u201cShe was a positive young lady.\u201d Her family is originally from Phoenix, Arizona, and has lived in the area for about a year, he said. She leaves behind an older sister and two younger siblings. Maupin said the family was distraught to see police maligning William\u2019s character and presenting her as a \u201csuspect\u201d, without much clarification. \u201cThis never should have happened,\u201d Maupin said. \u201cThis is a kid that is loved and respected by her family and valued by the community. The criminalization of Hannah and the attempted demonization of her is a shame.\u201d The killing by police in Orange county has reignited concerns about brutality by law enforcement in a region that has a history of excessive force scandals. The American Civil Liberties Union reported in 2017 that the local Anaheim police department used excessive force at a rate that far outpaced law enforcement agencies in similar cities. The county sheriff\u2019s department was also accused of brutalizing an intoxicated man in an incident caught on camera last year. Williams\u2019 family did not trust the Fullerton police to conduct a proper inquiry, Maupin said. \u201cThe local authorities are not capable of handling this situation. How can Fullerton police investigate itself?\u201d The family is expected to see Williams\u2019 body later on Tuesday, he said, adding that her loved ones were struggling to deal with the police\u2019s representation of her as a criminal: \u201cThey feel the need like any parent would \u2013 to defend the integrity of their child.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
