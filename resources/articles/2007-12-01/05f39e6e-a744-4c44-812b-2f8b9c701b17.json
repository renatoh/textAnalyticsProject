Teenagers will be offered intensive language classes and university students will be sent into schools as \"ambassadors\" for languages. The \u00a353m - pledged for the financial year starting in April - follows consistent concerns about the fall-off of language GCSEs since the government dropped it as a compulsory subject. In their children's plan last week ministers reaffirmed a promise to introduce compulsory languages by 2010 for all primary pupils. But opposition MPs pointed out that the funding only amounts to \u00a35m more than last year. Split between the 14,700 schools, that gives \u00a3340 each on average to work towards compulsory primary language classes by 2010. The schools minister, Jim Knight, said: \"Compulsory French or German GCSE study simply does not motivate pupils. We will generate enthusiasm and confidence for studying languages in secondary school and beyond - far more effective than simple compulsion.\" The number of candidates who took GCSEs in French dropped by almost 20,000 this year, or 8%, while German had the biggest percentage decrease of all GCSE subjects, down more than 10% on last year. Over half of England's secondary schools now teach languages to fewer than 50% of their GCSE pupils, according to research last month from Cilt, the national centre for languages. In one in 10 schools more than 90% of pupils were not studying languages, the research found. \" David Laws, the Liberal Democrat education spokesman, said: \"The government has made a total pig's ear of modern languages in our schools. Ministers should have put in place their modern language strategy for primary schools before making language GCSEs optional.\" A spokesman for the Department for Children, Schools and Families said that 70% of primary schools were already teaching languages."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
