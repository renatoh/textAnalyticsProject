The housing minister thinks it is crazy that the average age of a first-time buyer, who does not get financial assistance from a relative or friend, is now 36. \"In the 1980s it was a joke for a 30- something to still live with mum and dad. Today that is a forced reality for far too many people,\" he tells the Observer. A home is a \"simple basic human need\", he says, and the fact that it is becoming too expensive for those with average salaries and above means \"something is out of kilter\". What Shapps says reflects a depressing mood pervading the country: the realisation that for millions of young people, caught between sky-high house prices and tough mortgage restrictions, an enduring aspiration to own a home is increasingly unachievable. It has recently emerged that it would take 14 years for an average earner to save for a first-time deposit. According to the Resolution Foundation, which carries out research on lower earners, for those at the bottom of the income scale it could take most of their working lives. For many it will never happen. In a society in which the culture of home ownership is ingrained \u2013 where the private rental sector has long been overlooked \u2013 that is difficult to swallow. It comes alongside dire warnings that new rules to clamp down on irresponsible mortgage lending could actually close the door to thousands of prospective homebuyers. The Chartered Institute of Housing has warned that proposals by the Financial Services Authority would \"decimate mortgage advances to first-time buyers\". As it is, lending has slumped. According to figures from the Bank of England, the number of mortgage approvals was under 50,000 in October 2010, compared with a peak of 130,000 in November 2006. Shapps knows that the government is facing a crisis and he believes he has the answer: \"house price stability\". When he spells it out, what he is talking about is a small and gradual real-term fall in prices to make property more affordable over time, the end of boom and bust in the property market. Although the government has no magic solution to ensure the property bubble will not inflate once more, Shapps believes it can help to suppress it. He stresses that he supports the aspiration to buy \u2013 but he also wants people to be realistic. The time has come for property to be seen as something to live in and not an investment, he says. It sounds obvious, yet Shapps's position heralds a seismic cultural shift. After all, for decades people have relied on rising property prices to provide for their retirement. The minister's attitude could place him on a collision course with those who believe the younger generation deserve the same opportunities. But the reality he paints is one in which the door to home ownership is already closing on hundreds of thousands of young people. Take the latest figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders showing the proportion of first-time buyers purchasing property without any financial help from relatives or friends. That has plummeted from 63% in 2005 to just 17% in 2010. This means only one in six young people buying a home for the first time were able to do so by themselves. Figures also suggest that a new divide is opening up \u2013 not just between the rich and poor, old and young \u2013 but between those who do and do not have access to the \"bank of mum and dad\". \"Parental support plays a key role in shaping the housing options of young people in the UK, irrespective of social class,\" says Peter Mackie, an academic at the University of Cardiff who is carrying out a major piece of research on housing for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. \"[Parents] can influence in a positive or negative way, enabling young people to enter home ownership or restricting them. The average age of a first-time buyer without [financial] support is now 36.\" The foundation is running a project in which young people garner views from peers and others about housing. Natalie Starkey, 19, from Coventry, puts it bluntly: \"Housing worries people. It is something everyone needs.\" Some campaigners say it is time to place much more emphasis on the rental sector, which they say is insufficiently regulated. Organisations such as the Resolution Foundation and the charity Shelter, have exposed examples of rogue landlords withholding deposits unfairly, refusing long-term contracts and failing to ensure adequate standards in homes. For too long, say campaigners, the private rented sector has been seen as a stopgap for young people between their parents' homes and their own. It needs to be fit for purpose for the increasing numbers who neither qualify for social housing nor have any hope of buying. For them, long-term renting is a reality. Even shared ownership and other affordable housing schemes are out of reach for thousands. Take London's Pocket Living scheme which provides \"affordable\" homes. One 30-year-old woman applied to purchase a house and was told: \"You will need to demonstrate that [you have] access to a minimum savings amount of \u00a345,000.\" It all builds up to a society in which young people are increasingly reliant on their parents. A study by the Social Issues Research Centre described 18- to 25-year-olds as the \"bungee brood\" who had failed to sever links to their parental purse strings. Peter Marsh, director of the SIRC and author of the report \"Young People and Financial Independence\", says: \"Financial independence is now becoming out of reach for a vast majority of people unless they can rely on the 'bank of mum and dad'.\" He claimed that growing numbers of young adults were \"very cautious and depressed\" about their futures in terms of buying a home, paying off debt and finding a secure job. Karen Pine, professor of psychology at the University of Hertfordshire, talks of the \"Peter Pan syndrome\", where young adults failed to mature financially and built up expectations of dependence. As for those with no such support, embarking on a career in 2011 is even more worrying. They will welcome Shapps's vision of a more stable housing market \u2013 but whether it is something he can achieve remains to be seen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
