Liverpool's manager would have seen the Milanese delegation departing with Paolo Maldini at its head. If experience alone won finals, there would have been no complaints had Milan's remarkable captain tucked the trophy under his arm as he left. At 36 and a veteran of almost 900 club and international matches, he will tonight lead his team in his seventh European Cup or Champions League final. On four occasions, including the stunning 1994 4-0 demolition of Barcelona that ended the original champions-only era, he has been victorious. Win or lose, Maldini recalls all six finals, though they are starting to blur. \"It is a little difficult to come up with a different memory of each,\" he said yesterday without a hint of conceit. \"They do have one thing in common, however. \"They show an ambitious player found an ambitious club, and over these years together it has been interesting for both to play in six such games.\" He says the thrill does not fade. \"There is an emotional difference between today and my first final [1989], there is a different pressure. I was just 20 in my first final and less serene. My heart will still beat fast before the game, but I hope I can control it and make the right decisions once the game starts.\" Maldini's serenity is one reason his coach Carlo Ancelotti, a team-mate in that 1989 final, was able to assert he has slept well since arriving here. Another is the presence of Clarence Seedorf. Seedorf is aiming for his fourth triumph having collected winners' medals with three different clubs. \"Experience is very important, but I don't think age is a problem. Just look at Paolo, I think he proves that it is not an issue,\" he said. Add the defensive might of Alessandro Nesta and Kaka's invention, and Ancelotti's confidence that Milan have the weapons to win was understandable. Yet he must fear the consequences for him should a side also boasting Andriy Shevchenko up front lose to Ben\u00edtez's underdogs. \"We are more confident of ourselves than two years ago [Milan won the 2003 final against Juventus on penalties] and I am sure we will produce the performance that is necessary,\" Ancelotti said. He does not think it will go to a shoot-out tonight, though - \"It is difficult to believe it will go to penalties.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
