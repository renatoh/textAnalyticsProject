Guadalupe Garc\u00eda de Rayos, a 36-year-old mother of two US citizens, was a non-violent felon who had for years complied with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) orders after being convicted of using a fake social security number to work. But on Wednesday, when she went for her usual check-in, Ice agents took her into custody instead, separating her from her husband and children, who were waiting outside. Under a new executive order that President Trump signed on 25 January, Garc\u00eda de Rayos had become a priority for deportation. The order states that undocumented immigrants should be deported if they have been charged with any criminal offense. The president said the order was needed \u201cto ensure the public safety of the American people\u201d. By Wednesday night, more than 100 protesters gathered outside the Ice office in Phoenix and blocked several vans that were coming out. One of the vans was carrying Garc\u00eda de Rayos. One man tied himself to one of the van\u2019s front wheels, and seven demonstrators were arrested by Phoenix police officers, who showed up in riot gear at about 10pm. Garc\u00eda de Rayos\u2019s two children also tried to block the van carrying their mother. On Thursday, after learning the news that she had been deported, her children broke down crying. Jacqueline Garc\u00eda de Rayos, 14, described having to pack her mother\u2019s luggage so she could send it to Mexico. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that she was taken away from us,\u201d Jacqueline said. \u201cHer only crime was to work here so she could support us. \u201cShe is a very kind person,\u201d Jacqueline said. \u201cShe treats everyone like family. She hasn\u2019t done anything to harm anyone.\u201d On Thursday, Ice said in a statement that her \u201cimmigration case underwent review at multiple levels of the immigration court system, including the Board of Immigration Appeals, and the judges held she did not have a legal basis to remain in the US. Ice will continue to focus on identifying and removing individuals with felony convictions who have final orders of removal issued by the nation\u2019s immigration courts.\u201d Garc\u00eda de Rayos had been living in the US as an undocumented immigrant since she was 14 years old. Her husband, Aaron Reyes, is also undocumented. \u201cThis is our country, because this is where we\u2019ve lived most of our lives,\u201d Reyes said. \u201cWe went to school here. This is where we met and got married. This is where we formed our lives and this is where our children were born.\u201d Reyes said his family\u2019s \u201cnightmare\u201d began in 2008 when his wife was arrested during a workplace raid ordered by then Maricopa County sheriff Joe Arpaio at a water park in Mesa. After spending six months in jail, she was released. She was allowed to stay in the country on the condition that she check in with Ice for a brief review of her case and to answer a few questions once a year. She never had a problem until now. After going into the Ice office in Phoenix as usual, her husband and children anxiously waited for her outside but she didn\u2019t come out. Instead she was taken into custody and Ice agents began procedures to send her back to Mexico. Ray Ybarra Maldonado, the immigration attorney representing Garc\u00eda de Rayos, said his client was not deemed a priority for deportation under Obama because the administration\u2019s focus was on deporting immigrants who were a threat to public safety, had ties to gangs or had committed serious felony offenses. Garc\u00eda de Rayos didn\u2019t fit those criteria, he said, which is why she was allowed to stay in the US. \u201cI think this is a direct result of the new executive orders by the Trump administration that are being put into action,\u201d Maldonado said about Garc\u00eda de Rayos\u2019s deportation. He also said the order \u201chas nothing to do with public safety\u201d and \u201chas everything to do with separating families\u201d. \u201cAll because she was trying to work to support herself and her kids \u2013 which is the same thing any of us would\u2019ve done if we were in her situation \u2013 she was criminalized, given a class 6 felony and now she finds herself on the other side of the border,\u201d Maldonado said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
