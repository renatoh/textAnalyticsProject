Glazer's formal offer document is now not expected to be released until the beginning of next week after a couple of minor delays, but with a stake in excess of 76% the Tampa Bay Buccaneers owner effectively controls the club anyway. Having twice condemned Glazer's business plan as \"aggressive\", Gill has already indicated he thinks it is unworkable, but it appears he may stay on and try to execute it anyway after the American's camp insisted they wanted United's current management team to stay in place. However, the supporters who backed Gill's initial stance feel such a situation is untenable and have demanded he steps down from his \u00a3900,000-a-year post with immediate effect. \"We call on David Gill, the board of Manchester United plc and the board of Manchester United Football Club to lead by example and resign in protest at the takeover,\" said a statement issued by the Not4Sale coalition. \"We request that they do this at the earliest possible opportunity, as we do not see how they can continue to execute a business plan that they themselves describe as 'aggressive' and 'damaging'.\" \"We refuse to recognise the new owners of Manchester United plc as adequate, credible or positive custodians of Manchester United Football Club,\" explained Mark Longden, spokesman for the Independent Manchester United Supporters' Association. Among the many proposals are a continuation of the boycott of club merchandise and sponsors' products and the cancellation of MUTV subscriptions. Various means of challenging Glazer's buy-out were also outlined, with a major rally now planned for the Apollo Theatre in Manchester on Bank Holiday Monday, May 30. However, it was decided to limit protests at today's FA Cup final to a renewed call for supporters attending the game to wear black. This will please Sir Alex Ferguson and his opposite number Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, although the Arsenal manager was confident his side could deal with the impact of any protests, even if it included the match being stopped. \"If we have to wait a while then we will,\" said Wenger. \"I don't think it would disturb our concentration, although it may disturb theirs.\" Ten-point plan for fans: 1 Wear black at the FA Cup final; 2 Hold public rally; 3 Use customer power to boycott merchandise, sponsors' products and cancel MUTV subscriptions; 4 Boycott matches; 5 Use shareholder power; 6 Call on David Gill and remainder of United board to resign; 7 Make Glazer and his backers aware of anger; 8 Write in protest to Premier League, Football Association and MPs; 9 Challenge the media; 10 Join a supporters' group."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
