This time, however, the guns are not Israeli, but those of the Lebanese army. More astonishingly, this military action has the qualified approval of the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, who have allowed Lebanese soldiers to take up positions 500 metres inside Nahr al-Bared camp, where the fighting has been raging since Sunday. For 38 years 400,000 Palestinians have had the status of being \"guests\" of the country, and an agreement with the PLO stops the Lebanese army entering the camps. But since last November the Palestinian camps have been getting some unwelcome guests of their own. Quite who Fatah al-Islam are, or where they came from, is a matter of dispute. The US-backed government of Lebanon claimed they were tools of Syrian intelligence, but there is little concrete evidence that they are: Syria's foreign minister, Walid Muallem, has publicly condemned the organisation, arguing that it does not serve the Palestinian cause. Palestinians fleeing the fighting in the camp report that the militant group is composed of Syrians, Jordanians, Saudis and Iraqis. The armed jihadis - Sunnis by religion - appeared in the camps a year ago on motorbikes and scooters, and have been there ever since. Their aim was not to fight their holy war against the Lebanese, but to use the camps as a logistics base. They count Lebanese among their supporters, as there are Salafi Sunnis in the poor communities in the north of the country. The present fighting was triggered by an army raid on houses of suspects involved in a bank raid in Tripoli. The militants burst out and overwhelmed army positions. At least 25 soldiers were killed and 40 injured in the fighting, Lebanon's worst internal violence since its protracted civil war ended in 1990. As the artillery barrage has been claiming more and more Palestinian lives, anger in the camps has been mounting. The Hizbullah-led opposition, like the Lebanese government's other foes, have stayed on the sidelines of this bloody battle. Yesterday the prime minister, Fouad Siniora, vowed to \"finish off\" the militant group, and the Druze leader Walid Jumblatt, a leading member of his coalition, called on the Palestinian factions of Fatah and Hamas to act against Fatah al-Islam. But relations between Palestinians and the Lebanese authorities are strained and the dangers of this conflagration spreading to other camps and other areas of Lebanon are real. The already weak and divided country - still recovering from its civil war - remains highly volatile, and its poor Sunni communities are a fertile ground for radical groups."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
