Musician Stephen Morris was reunited with the 310-year old violin made by David Tecchler on Friday night after leaving it on a Southeastern train last month, prompting a nationwide appeal for its return. Tired after a long day recording at Abbey Road studios, Morris left the violin on the London Victoria to Orpington train when he got off at Penge East for his home in Sydenham. The man who picked it up was initially treated as a suspect when CCTV images of him with the violin were released by the British Transport Police (BTP) last week. After publication of the appeal last Thursday, which has since been deleted by the police, a man referring to himself as \u2018Gene\u2019 contacted Morris via Twitter to say he recognised the person in the picture. There then followed an intense period of negotiation led by Morris\u2019s friend Mike Pannett, a former Scotland Yard police officer. Morris, who met Pannett on a fly fishing trip to the Outer Hebrides in the 1990s, said his friend was the \u201cengine room\u201d of the operation to recover the violin. Speaking to the Guardian, Pannett said: \u201cIt was quite obvious to me and the detectives [at the BTP] that whoever had this violin was desperate to get it back but was panicking because they didn\u2019t want to get into trouble. \u201cI knew from my experience that we weren\u2019t dealing with a hardened criminal. We were dealing with somebody who had initially made a bit of a mistake [in picking up the violin] and had panicked.\u201d It took two days of negotiations to persuade Gene to show up with the violin. Pannett said: \u201cThere was no ransom, we just appealed to his better nature. It was a combination of reassurance and human decency that this was a serious piece of history and that we wanted it back. It was: \u2018Get it back to us, reassured that you\u2019re not just going to be jumped on and arrested.\u2019 \u201cWe were just stressed that we wanted a positive outcome, but it did take a while.\u201d After two previous suggested drop-offs fell through, Pannett eventually convinced Gene to bring the violin to Morris at a car park next to Beckenham Junction railway station after 10pm last Friday night. Pannett and several BTP officers were watching undercover in case anything went wrong. He said: \u201cIt was very tense. We sent Steve on his own to a Waitrose car park, past 10pm and it was raining. We had Steve\u2019s safety absolutely covered. But when our man walked up to hand it over he would not have been aware of that. We were all tucked away.\u201d Pannett said Gene appeared relieved when he emerged with the undamaged violin. \u201cYou could tell by the expression on this young man\u2019s face when he walked up \u2013 he had the biggest smile on his face \u2013 that he knew he\u2019d done the right thing and the pressure had come off and he could carry on with his life. That expression said it all.\u201d He added: \u201cAll he wanted was to apologise, shake Steve\u2019s hand and make nothing more of it.\u201d Pannett paid tribute to Gene\u2019s decency. \u201cI would congratulate him. He has done the right thing and set a great example to anyone else who ever finds himself in that position.\u201d Pannett said the clandestine operation was the most satisfying job of his career. \u201cI\u2019ve dealt with some horrific cases, including the cop killer Gary Nelson. But for cracking the case, this has got to be probably the most satisfying job I\u2019ve ever been involved in because it meant such a lot personally.\u201d Pannett and Morris are now planning how to celebrate. \u201cWe are already talking about a fly fishing trip and beer.\u201d Morris said: \u201cIt couldn\u2019t have ended in a happier way.\u201d Speaking to the BBC, he said: \u201cI feel a bit battered and bruised \u2026 I haven\u2019t had a great deal of sleep since it went missing.\u201d Referring to Gene, he added: \u201cHe was very apologetic, he said he wanted to hand it to me in person.\u201d On Sunday Morris appeared on television with his Tecchler violin and said he was still getting over the shock of instrument\u2019s return. Morris expressed his gratitude by playing a version of Amazing Grace."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
