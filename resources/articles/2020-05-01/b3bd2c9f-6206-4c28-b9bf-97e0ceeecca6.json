Near-empty buses roll down Dundas Street and shush across the junction in the haar (fog). In this brave mute world \u2013 a month of Christmas mornings so far \u2013 I watch lone joggers and mothers with children, and wave at good dogs. I write to my friends. I check in by phone. \u201cYes,\u201d I say, several times a week, \u201cEdinburgh\u2019s very nice. Quiet.\u201d Two years ago, I spent several months travelling for a book, seeking out solitude and remote locations \u2013 strange to think now. I visited wild places on the edge \u2013 frozen Soviet ghost towns, Mars missions in the Utah desert, shrines perched high on Japanese mountains \u2013 as well as spartan structures whose wildness emanated from within, such as Simon Starling\u2019s metamorphic installation Shedboatshed, the writing \u201cWendy houses\u201d of Roald Dahl and Tove Jansson, and Roger Deakin\u2019s Suffolk shepherd\u2019s hut. I\u2019m thinking about these places a lot these days; about the way different people either embraced their outposts or, like Jack Kerouac, went to pieces. Kerouac spent his 63 days as a wildfire spotter crazed and lonely, beset by nightmares of yetis and bears \u2026 as well as by actual bears. There are fewer bears in Edinburgh but the cabin fever is still very real. Here we all are isolating inside, alone together. Parisian writer Sylvain Tesson makes the point in his marvellous book Consolations of the Forest when he\u2019s left alone for six months in a cabin in the middle of the Russian Taiga: \u201cIt\u2019s \u201327\u00b0 F. The truck has dissolved into the fog. Silence falls from the sky in little white shavings. To be alone is to hear silence \u2026 I will finally find out if I have an inner life.\u201d The closest I came to such boondocks deprivation in my outpost travels was the days I spent helping renovate a bunkhouse in the middle of Iceland\u2019s interior tundra \u2013 plumb in the middle of nowhere. The hut, called Hv\u00edt\u00e1rnes, was built in 1930 and sits on the shore of a frozen lake facing Iceland\u2019s second-largest glacier. Such cabins are called s\u00e6luh\u00fas in Iceland \u2013 houses of joy \u2013 and it\u2019s easy to see why when one pictures the ancient Norse people sighting such a shelter after a long day\u2019s slog. Originally built as way stations along ancient roads, they are used today by people exploring this country\u2019s uncanny beauty. Rebuilt and reimagined over the centuries, s\u00e6luh\u00fas now range in form from rudimentary rock-and-turf igloos to solid chalets with plumbing and stoves. I travelled to Hv\u00edt\u00e1rnes with two carpenters, Stef\u00e1n and Atli, to fix up the building for future hikers. As we drove towards the glacier\u2019s huge white maw, the s\u00e6luh\u00fas emerged from the grass and marsh: red roof, green gables, white sides banked with turf. A little cabin sitting up, hugging its knees. \u201cSo, you know this place we are going is a very haunted house,\u201d Stef\u00e1n announced. \u201cOh yes?\u201d I replied. Atli met my eye in the rearview mirror. \u201cOh yes!\u201d he said. \u201cOh yes.\u201d It turned out Hv\u00edt\u00e1rnes is one of the most haunted buildings in Iceland \u2013 a title for which there\u2019s a lot of competition in a country steeped in fantastic tales and the supernatural. I was furnished with copious tales of spectral encounters \u2013 ghostly women haunting sleepers in the \u201cbad bed\u201d, doors slamming, heavy footsteps in the attic; or walkers approaching a well-lit cabin full of life but opening the front door to find the inside freezing, dark and silent. Imagine walking all day and reaching, at dusk, the only man-made structure on a vast permafrosted plateau to find your bothy beset by poltergeists. It would be\u2026 upsetting. But there was no sign of malevolence for the first week, and work to replace rotten planking and posts went well. In 24-hour daylight we hammered and dug, wrapped up against the wind, tiny figures in a leopard-print prairie. And we all slept well in our cosy cots \u2026 Until the time Stef\u00e1n had \u201ca long night with the ghost\u201d \u2013 an Inception-style series of dreams within dreams, none of them good. \u201cI\u2019m part-troll so I can deal with it,\u201d he told me next morning with a wry smile, but he looked knackered, like a man who\u2019d fought his way out of a supernatural tumble dryer. If ever I awake after bad dreams now, I think of Stef\u00e1n\u2019s matter-of-fact \u201cI\u2019m part troll\u201d mantra, because I think it\u2019s true that being at peace with oneself is important for any traveller who wishes to explore the unknown. So often wild places reveal us to ourselves \u2013 how we are, whether we\u2019re happy in our own skin. If only Kerouac had possessed Stef\u00e1n\u2019s stoicism, faced with the great beyond. So often, to paraphrase early conservationist John Muir, going out is really going in. In these locked-down times, many may be longing for company, noise and bustle, but solitude still enthrals me; just as much as wilderness, I think it\u2019s a great teacher. \u2022 Dan Richards is author of Outpost: A Journey to the Wild Ends of the Earth (Canongate, \u00a39.99)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
