And perhaps also the man-mountain striding purposefully through them? The third series of The A Word opened with a shaggy dog story, told by the grandad and volunteer firefighter Maurice (Christopher Eccleston), which confirmed him to be as gloriously obtuse as ever. Everything else in the lives of the Hughes Scotts seems to be in flux. Two years on from the events of the last series, Paul (Lee Ingleby) and Alison (Morven Christie) are living 100 miles apart \u2013 her in Manchester, him still in their Lake District town \u2013 and sharing the care of their now-10-year-old autistic son, Joe. Their daughter Rebecca (Molly Wright) is staying with Maurice on a visit home from uni, and Alison\u2019s brother Eddie (Greg McHugh) has also moved in. It is clear, though, just how far this fractured family have come since Joe\u2019s initial diagnosis. His parents now have the communication tools and strategies in place to tackle problems as they arise. There\u2019s a poetry to their care handover ritual, for instance, which neurotypical people may also find soothing. \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to go there, and you to stay here,\u201d says mum or dad. Joe replies: \u201cThere, here; here, there,\u201d and is then offered the choice of a goodbye hug or handshake. He usually goes for the handshake. They are doing really well, but that doesn\u2019t mean it is not still hard. The A Word always did hit us directly in the feels and its theme of anxious parents struggling to reassure anxious kids is doubly resonant for audiences under lockdown. Even Joe\u2019s soundtrack-providing habit of blocking out the world with indie disco favourites is no longer a failsafe, and when he throws his beloved headphones into a lake, Paul blames Maurice\u2019s disruptive influence. So while \u201cautism\u201d is no longer a banned expletive, perhaps \u201cthe D-word\u201d has replaced it? \u201c\u2018Divorce\u201d, \u2018single parent\u2019 \u2013 they feel like words you\u2019d use for somebody else, don\u2019t they?\u201d says a sympathetic Eddie. Or maybe what really bothers Paul is his suspicion that Alison is having an easier time of it in Manchester. In fact, she is also facing up to her parental failings. Maurice remains the unrivalled master of saying the wrong thing at the worst possible time, but Alison can also stumble over her words when discussing Joe \u2013 even as she snaps at strangers in car parks, for similar blunders. \u201cI\u2019ve spent the last 10 years fighting my son\u2019s corner,\u201d she told her father. \u201cMaybe it got to be a habit and now I\u2019m just always looking for a fight? I don\u2019t want to be like that!\u201d Maurice \u2013 ever caring, never tactful \u2013 is also the confidant of choice when Louise (Pooky Quesnel) wants to find out what Ralph (Leon Harrop), her adult son who has Down\u2019s syndrome, is up to. \u201cWe need a disco,\u201d is Ralph\u2019s eccentric way of breaking the news of his wedding. (If they haven\u2019t booked a DJ yet, I know of a muso 10-year-old with his own brand-new headphones who may be cheap.) Indeed, Maurice\u2019s very centrality to the show is starting to feel like an ominous hint that he won\u2019t survive the series; drama writers are just contrary like that. His incredulous reaction when Dr Graves advised him to go easy on the local superhero shtick also doesn\u2019t bode well: \u201cI\u2019m not 60 in the way other men are! I\u2019m not a normal man!\u201d In the unhappy event that the irreplaceable Maurice does need replacing, the show has some promising additions. Alison\u2019s car park run-in could have been merely an illustration of her prickly temper, but actor David Gyasi is far too handsome to play bit parts; he may as well have had \u201cNew Love Interest\u201d written on the side of his van. We\u2019ll also probably be seeing more of Joe\u2019s teacher, since she is played by Julie Hesmondhalgh, and you don\u2019t hire an actor of that calibre just to do a bit of small talk at the school gates. Back in series one, a specialist listed \u201cfinds change difficult\u201d among the set of behaviours that place Joe somewhere on the autistic spectrum, and The A Word has since demonstrated that, actually, to varying degrees, we all do. So if it is a healthy model for accepting life\u2019s only constant that you\u2019re after, you could do much worse than to tune in. As the series begins, it\u2019s holding on tight to what endures and gracefully letting go what doesn\u2019t."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
