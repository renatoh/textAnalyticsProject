Our citizens have succumbed to fear. Fear of an exaggerated external threat that was created in part by our own foreign policy; fear of economic hardship, fuelled by reckless government expenditures; and fear of introspection, lest we admit what we have done to much of the world. But we also have hope: that we can be worthy of the occasional admiration we have enjoyed in the past. I pray that I represent more than half of the population - those who have the courage to bring about our own regime change. But, God forbid, should that not happen, remember that not all Americans are represented by all that you might resent or despise. Most of us have integrity, honesty and compassion. We just don't happen to hold the offices that let you see it. Gunther Rainhold Portland, Oregon Why is everyone so determined in the UK to imagine the worst: a Bush victory tomorrow. Is this so that the sense of relief is greater? The optimists this side of the pond are pointing out that young people and normally non-voting Americans will be turning out in droves, and the pollsters have no access to these Democrat supporters, so we don't hear about them on Fox news. While the pessimists and panickers are producing the most magnificent political satire, cartoons and tracts, a veritable army of lawyers is preparing to sue Jeb Bush and his ilk, in the case of repetitive theft syndrome; even the most biased reports suggest that the race is close. Tania Edwards Brooklyn, New York I was just watching ABC television on your Clark County letter-writing campaign and all the negative response it has brought. Well I am one American who would like to thank you. I think it is a wonderful idea. It's a good thing to get opinions from an outsider. They are more objective. I think you should all be proud of yourselves and do not let a few ignorant, narrow-minded people discourage you. You can send me a letter anytime. Andria Gibson Grundy, Virginia Thank you enormously for the Documentography project (Guardian Unlimited, October 30) to capture images of diverse American families in this week up to our elections. Over here we are being bombarded with tawdry campaign advertising. It is a profound delight to visit with the \"real people\" of your project. You provide the best US election coverage, hands down. Joanne Striley Joliet, Illinois I hope you limeys have had your fun at the expense of President Bush. We could retaliate, except we like Mr Blair and believe him to be an up and up guy. We especially appreciate his support in our quest to rid the world of terrorism. Yes, President Bush believes in fighting to save the liberal scumbags who write for the Guardian, despite their disdain for him. He believes in doing the right thing, even when others do not. If Kerry is elected, you'll find out that after he's sold out his own country, he'll sell you out - right after Israel. Robert Moon Fort Worth, Texas As a liberal Democrat who has watched the prime minister cosy up to the most malevolent and incompetent president in US history, I - and most of my fellow Democrats - have little use for Mr Blair. He has been perfectly willing to sell us out for his own narrow political interests and I hope that if Senator Kerry is elected, he will invite Gordon Brown not Tony Blair to the White House.
