This figure excludes cases among US sailors infected on the USS Theodore Roosevelt, which is currently docked in Guam, and cases in West Papua, which has been excluded due to our lack of confidence in the data. With infection rates slowing throughout the Pacific islands as well as in Australia and New Zealand, talk has begun to turn to exit strategies. Public health officials and politicians are keeping a close watch on Papua New Guinea, fearing a widespread outbreak there, but elsewhere the talk is about how to begin restarting economies and opening borders. Among the options being discussed is the idea of a trans-Tasman bubble. Arguing that New Zealand and Australia are \u201cbeating the crap\u201d out of the virus, New Zealand\u2019s deputy prime minister, Winston Peters, has touted the idea of renewed travel to and from Australia. Many are already lobbying for the Pacific to be included in the \u201cbubble\u201d if and when it should happen, though any benefits of reopening travel to these nations would have to be weighed against the health risks to the region. Pacific economies continue to suffer. French Polynesia fears that its economy may have lost US$1.2bn, along with 25,000 jobs. In Solomon Islands, a major project to upgrade the international airport is in limbo and the government fears it may have to be terminated with the key personnel having left the country because of Covid-19 fears. What has happened this week? Guam: The country is still reporting a trickle of new cases. As of Monday, the official total was 149. Five people have died. Even as positive cases among the crew of the USS Theodore Roosevelt passed 1,100, the first recovered sailors began returning to duty. French Pacific territories: The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has suggested that the French Pacific territories might provide a test case for France\u2019s exit from Covid-19 restrictions. Meanwhile, kava bars throughout New Caledonia were finally permitted to reopen. No new cases have been reported in New Caledonia for more than 30 days. Fiji: With no new cases reported for more than two weeks, there are only four active cases remaining in the country. Papua New Guinea: No new cases have been reported and all eight of the confirmed cases have recovered. Surveillance and contact tracing is continuing, including in border areas. Almost 1,500 tests have been undertaken, with the bulk of them in and around Port Moresby. West Papua: A surge in cases in the mining hub of Mimika regency is cause for concern. The population, with a large contingent of mine workers, is highly mobile. Officially, there are 283 cases on the Indonesian half of the island of Papua as at 2 May, but fears remain that these numbers are significantly under-reported. Seven people have died. The government has designated five hospitals to deal with Covid-19 cases across a population of four million. Between them the facilities have access to 60 ventilators. Vanuatu: Local business leaders continue to argue that unnecessary restrictions on the flow of cargo caused by Covid-19 fears are severely delaying the flow of relief supplies to parts of the country affected by cyclone Harold. The Vanuatu Daily Post reported that less than 10% of 12,000 affected households on one island alone had received shelter kits. Solomon Islands: In-country testing capacity is being strengthened in order that Solomon Islanders who are stranded overseas can be safely repatriated. A mandatory quarantine period of 14 days will be applied when people arrive home. Palau: The country remains virus-free. In-country testing capacity has been boosted by equipment donated by Taiwan. In his State of the Republic address, the president, Tommy Remengesau, criticised the WHO for neglecting Taiwan saying that this was endangering not just the Taiwanese, but people of all countries. What are Pacific governments doing? Papua New Guinea: In an interview with the Guardian, Jelta Wong, the country\u2019s new health minister, revealed the country was not equipped for a pandemic such as the coronavirus outbreak and took too long to acquire PPE. More PPE has arrived in the country through the PNGAus partnership and Wong says the country\u2019s stock of 15 ventilators (one per 600,000 people), will soon be boosted by another \u201chundred or so\u201d on their way. Fiji: The prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, confirmed last week that the country only has four active cases remaining, out of 18 that have been confirmed in Fiji since the crisis began. There have been no deaths. Lockdowns were ended in two communities, but a nationwide curfew remains in place. The government is undertaking an online survey to assess the economic impacts of the virus. Solomon Islands: The government has sought to address concerns raised by the opposition relating to a cargo ship from China that was allegedly allowed to enter Solomon Islands without complying with quarantine protocols. The legality of the curfew imposed over the Easter weekend has been challenged in the courts. The government has announced a stimulus package that is worth nearly A$60m, with a special focus on agriculture. Vanuatu: The government is under pressure to facilitate repatriation of ni-Vanuatu overseas. The director of public health has said that an isolation unit and testing capacity will be in place by mid-May, and must be operational before residents and others will be permitted to enter. New Caledonia: With no new cases in several weeks, the government has said it is nearly 100% certain the virus is not spreading in the territory. While most domestic restrictions are being rolled back, the borders will remain closed for the time being. Tonga: The government has begun relaxing restrictions on public gatherings and other activities, but remains cautious. While daily church services will be allowed, no more than 20 people may attend. Nightclubs may reopen, but only during limited hours. Tonga\u2019s top health official, Siale \u2018Akau\u2019ola, said Tonga was not ready to reopen borders and when it did it would be first to countries with no recorded cases of the virus. Samoa: The state of emergency has been extended until the end of May. Schools and churches will be permitted to reopen, but must maintain physical distancing. A special flight to allow repatriation of citizens from New Zealand has been scheduled for later in May and they will be required to go into quarantine upon arrival. Marshall Islands: Authorities have extended the ban on inbound travel until 5 June at the earliest. French Polynesia: The government is confident that the spread of the virus in the territory has stopped. The government is (belatedly, according to critics) planning for the return of stranded residents from overseas and is setting criteria for travellers generally. People who can present a valid medical certificate dated within three days of arrival, and who have had no symptoms for at least two weeks prior, will be allowed to enter without being quarantined. Others will have to self-isolate for two weeks. Kiribati: Xinhua news agency reports that the country has received its first batch of medical supplies from China, including PPE, contactless thermometers and related gear. Northern Mariana Islands: The government announced that the \u201clast\u201d Covid-19 patient has recovered. A total of 14 people were infected, with two deaths. Flights between Saipan and Guam resumed last Saturday. Australia and New Zealand Australia has recorded around 6,850 confirmed cases, with 97 deaths and has mostly been recording fewer than 20 new cases a day across the country \u2013 a requirement of further lifting of restrictions, according to the country\u2019s chief medical officer. The government is due to announce the next tranche of restrictions to be lifted on Friday after national cabinet. New Zealand, which has had just shy of 1,500 cases and 20 deaths, has had its first week of level-3 lockdown, after relaxing restrictions last week. The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, joined Australia\u2019s national cabinet meeting on Tuesday via videolink. Fake news The WHO has been tweeting out factchecks about Covid-19, including that living in a country with a lot of sunshine does not prevent people from contracting the virus. The WHO has also tweeted that people should not inject or ingest bleach or disinfectant to cure Covid-19 infections, contray to some advice. What did they say? It\u2019s not about to happen next week. \u2013 The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, on plans to restart travel between Australia and New Zealand, though he and Ardern have said they would like to see that happen \u201cas soon as it\u2019s safe to do so\u201d. Good news A Singaporean man has been rescued after being stranded at sea for three months and being turned away from three countries as ports around the world closed due to coronavirus. As news about the Covid-19 outbreak began to spread around the world, Wong Tetchoong tried to dock in Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Tuvalu, but was turned away as international borders and ports were closed. Wong made it to Fijian waters on 28 April. By this point his yacht was damaged and strong winds prevented him from sailing into the harbour, so he was rescued by a Fiji Navy patrol boat, which brought his yacht safely to shore. He is healthy and in talks with the Singaporean government and his family about returning home. Infection and fatality figures in this article are valid as of 4 May. They are based on WHO daily situation reports, and supplemented in some cases by national government updates."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
