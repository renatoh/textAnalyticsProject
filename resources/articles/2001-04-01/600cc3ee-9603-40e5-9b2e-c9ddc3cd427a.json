It was a particularly good day for Coventry City's reserve striker John Aloisi, who scored six times, and Wolves' Kevin Muscat, Australia's captain, who added five. But Australia, 75th in Fifa's world rankings, could smash their record tomorrow when they play American Samoa, ranked No203 and officially the worst team in the world. Tonga, commonly known as the \"Friendly Islands\", conceded 10 goals by half-time despite their defensive 10-0-0 formation. Aloisi netted his double hat-trick in the first 61 minutes but was subsequently substituted after a 14-minute goal drought. Although Australia left many of their Premiership stars in England, the Tongan coach Gary Phillips criticised the Socceroos for picking eight foreign-based professionals. \"I do not see the point of some of these superstars coming back for this,\" Phillips said. \"If you add together the value of the Australian team and then divide it by five, then you have the value of the Tongan economy.\" Many of their club managers, including Dick Advocaat of Rangers, are equally disgruntled. With a population of just over 100,000, Tonga lost their first international 8-0 to Fiji in 1979. They have since won five international matches and are ranked 185th in the world. The five biggest World Cup victories: 1 Tonga 0 - 22 Australia, April 9 2001 2 Iran 19 - 0 Guam, November 24 2000 3 Maldives 0 - 17 Iran, June 2 1997 4 Tajikistan 16 - 0 Guam, November 26 2000 5 Australia 13 - 0 Solomon Islands, June 11 1997"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
