They include the first seven home last year, headed by Amberleigh House. Clan Royal, runner-up 12 months ago, is generally the 12-1 favourite with leading bookmakers to go one better on April 9. Monty's Pass, the 2003 winner and fourth last year, was soundly beaten behind Rathgar Beau at Thurles yesterday but Mike Futter, speaking for owners the Dee Racing Syndicate, expects him to head to Aintree. \"We are happy, as the ground was too testing for him,\" he said. Rathgar Beau, meanwhile, was cut to 20-1 from 25-1 by totesport for the Queen Mother Champion Chase after his return to form."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
