IAG\u2019s chief executive, Willie Walsh, said that the company would reach the net-zero target largely through offsetting but pledged its airlines, including Aer Lingus and Iberia, would also substantially reduce emissions through sustainable fuels and replacing older aircraft. Walsh said offsetting was the only way aviation could promise to carbon net zero and that electric or hydrogen planes would not be an option for most international flights. Offsetting allows companies to invest in environmental projects to balance out their own carbon footprints but it has been criticised as a get-out clause for highly polluting businesses. Walsh said: \u201cWe will continue to use a carbon-based fuel throughout. We don\u2019t see a credible alternative. It\u2019s going to be some time until we see an electric or hybrid-electric plane \u2026 you\u2019re looking at smaller aircraft capable of flying up to 150 passengers up to 1,000km. The technology to cover the entire network is some time away.\u201d However, he argued that aviation offsetting would invest in regulated, verified carbon-reduction schemes, whereas levies on flying would disappear into general taxation. He said: \u201cIn the past there have been concerns about the schemes. It\u2019s very clear that any offsetting scheme has to be a permanent reduction in CO2, and verifiable.\u201d The aviation industry has set a general target of a 50% cut in emissions from 2005 levels by 2050, largely through offsetting in the Corsia scheme set up by the UN aviation agency, ICAO. Aviation accounts for more than 2% of global emissions but its contribution to CO2 levels is forecast to grow rapidly, due to rising passenger numbers and the industry\u2019s reliance on fossil fuel-burning planes. Walsh agreed flying could become \u201csocially unacceptable\u201d if it did not cut emissions. \u201cFor some people it will be, in the same way that a car is. But a lot of activity that is normal and socially acceptable today will not be in future.\u201d But, he added: \u201cWhen I took my first flight in 1979 it was a privilege. The idea that you go back to where only a privileged few can experience flying is, I think, socially unacceptable.\u201d Walsh said BA was offsetting domestic flight emissions as people could choose to travel by train: \u201cIn the UK where there is an alternative, there is a greater focus on making sure aviation is paying its way to address the environmental impact.\u201d IAG is responsible for about 3% of global aviation\u2019s emissions, which equates to 29.9m tonnes of CO2 per annum out of the industry\u2019s 915m tonnes. Walsh said BA would not fly its remaining 33 Boeing 747 jumbos, the heaviest consumers of fuel in the fleet, after 2024. Walsh said the new Airbus A350-1000, which has just entered service on the transatlantic route to Toronto, would typically use 43 instead of 70 tonnes of jet fuel to carry a similar number of passengers. Questioned if it should do more, he said: \u201cWe are the first to do it, so if it\u2019s not enough, the world has to do more. We\u2019re aligning ourselves with the government. It\u2019s a huge change from what the industry committed to, so it\u2019s a challenging target, a lot of work and a lot of money.\u201d The cost of offsetting UK flights, which generate about 400,000 tonnes of CO2, is expected to be about \u20ac3.2m (\u00a33m) next year. BA has pledged to invest \u00a3327m in sustainable fuel over the next 20 years, including its recently approved joint venture to build a waste-to-jet fuel plant in the UK. Environmental groups, however, dismissed the IAG initiative. Greenpeace said BA wanted to \u201chave their cake and eat it\u201d. John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cOffsetting is no answer to the climate emergency that we face, where we have to stop business as usual. BA really need to think much more seriously than this. \u201cWhat we need is a frequent flyer levy, which would be a better way to go in terms of reducing demand.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
