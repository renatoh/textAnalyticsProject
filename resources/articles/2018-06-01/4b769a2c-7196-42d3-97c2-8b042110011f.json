The Manchester City forward will fulfil a lifetime ambition by wearing the England No 10 shirt in Russia \u2013 he even sports another tattoo of the shirt number on his arm signifying his days in the youth team at Queens Park Rangers \u2013 and will go into the tournament fit and focused. The 23-year-old urged the team to prove themselves \u201cmore arrogant and streetwise\u201d than at previous finals and as Gareth Southgate\u2019s side completed their preparations with the visit of Costa Rica to Elland Road on Thursday. Sterling had addressed his late arrival at the national squad\u2019s training camp following Saturday\u2019s friendly victory over Nigeria, conceding he would have accepted being dropped. But, speaking as all 23 of the party took part in a speed-dating style interview session in the St George\u2019s Park futsal hall on Tuesday, he confronted the fall-out from the tattoo more fully. The image of the gun on his leg had been photographed during an England training session and provoked an outcry in some quarters, with Lucy Cope, who founded Mothers Against Guns after her son Damian was shot dead outside a club in London in 2002, claiming the tattoo was \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d. The player had taken to social media to explain the picture had a deeper meaning given he was two years old when his father was shot dead, and he had promised he \u201cwould never touch a gun\u201d. Asked about the criticism, Sterling said: \u201cNo, I can see, most definitely, where they\u2019re coming from. You see a gun on someone\u2019s leg, you are going to automatically think, \u2018What the hell are you doing?\u2019 But, from my point of view, I\u2019ve had that since August or September, I know there\u2019ve been pictures of it before so why, at this moment in time, does it get reported about? \u201cI don\u2019t really take it personally. Me and my mum and my agent sometimes talk about it. Little things, like what happened the other day, people expect me to be really affected by it, but I\u2019ve been through harder stuff in my life to get down by that, so that\u2019s the least of my worries. I don\u2019t feel there\u2019s an agenda against me. People ask: \u2018Do you feel picked on?\u2019 And I don\u2019t at all. As I said, I can see the reasons. \u201cThe boys have seen I haven\u2019t been affected by it, they know I\u2019m fine. If they did see something wrong they would be the first to come to me. I\u2019ve got a massive opportunity here, with a great bunch of players, to represent England at a World Cup, and that\u2019s my biggest focus now. And that tattoo [story], it\u2019s going to be spoken [about] for one or two days. Football is the most important thing now.\u201d Danny Rose, Jamie Vardy and Jack Butland are expected to start against Costa Rica when Sterling, who wore England\u2019s No19 at the 2014 finals and No7 at Euro 2016, hopes Southgate\u2019s side demonstrate the kind of streetwise streak they will need at the finals. \u201cWe need to control games and be a bit more arrogant with the ball,\u201d said the City player, who was booked for a perceived dive by the Italian referee on Saturday. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to say it, but we have to be more arrogant and more streetwise because we are coming up against some great teams who have that streetwise mentality. They bring their play into it: you do what you have to do to win a game. Simple as that. Be streetwise and clever. \u201cWatch the Champions League final and when Liverpool go 3-1 down, the way Madrid control the game. They have that winning mentality in big games, not doing anything silly. No panic. They see the game out and once we get that, we\u2019ll be a really good team. The one thing I don\u2019t like hearing is someone saying, \u2018We\u2019ll see what happens.\u2019 Forget all of that. I\u2019m not coming here to spend five or six weeks of my life to say, \u2018Let\u2019s see what happens and, hopefully, last 16.\u2019 \u201cA quarter-final won\u2019t be good enough at all because we want to win it. Every player wants to win the World Cup, every country wants to win the World Cup, so anything less than that is not really a bonus. Of course you can take positives out of everything, but you won\u2019t be entirely happy if you don\u2019t win it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
