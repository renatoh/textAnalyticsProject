The image fronts the business card of her husband Dominic Berning's eponymous five-year-old gallery, which now occupies part of the building in London's East End. Unusually, it's also the couple's home, and the art here is free-range, rampantly colonising the house (save for a private bedroom, bathroom and kitchen). Sometimes this is insidious, and the more interesting for it. 'We like the ambiguity of art that could be construed as a part of our home or of a formal exhibition,' says de Monchaux. The building's pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance remains its roof, still crowned with its light-spangled dome and, for now, a very complementary site-specific sculpture of a greenhouse frame entwined with light-bulbs, by an artist who, idiosyncratically, calls himself LEO. 'The building used to be an electricity showroom selling electrical goods,' explains Berning. 'The East End was one of the first areas to be introduced to the National Grid, circa 1910.' Evidence of local municipal pride in this milestone stares at you from across the road: the fa\u00e7ade of Shoreditch Town Hall trumpets the motto, 'More light, more power.' The showroom closed in the 70s, but was recently refurbished by Seng Watson, owner of hip bar the Shoreditch Electricity Showrooms, which fills the ground floor. 'We love its eccentricity,' says Berning. 'There's enough space to show lots of things, from paintings to large installations. Running a gallery from home keeps your overheads down. And showing art in a domestic context helps people to envisage how it might look in their home.' It is tempting to assume that the building's history influences the type of art shown here now, although Berning says its light-orientated bias is just a coincidence. The current show, called Hope Springs Eternal, displays rectangular video pieces by Eline McGeorge, which, fixed to the wall, superficially mimic paintings, until you realise that, disconcertingly, their images move. Then there's regular exhibitor Martin Richman's elegantly simple light pieces. On the stairs to the roof - with its terrace overlooking hyper-hip Hoxton - is his stepladder whose rungs glow ice blue. On the floor below, in the living room (which adjoins the kitchen, bedroom and bathroom), he has filled the windows with opaque glass that contain a daylight-like light, which only becomes visible as night falls. De Monchaux, who studied at Goldsmiths College and was a Turner Prize nominee in 1998, has shown a very typical work of hers here - multisensory and simultaneously seductive and morbid. 'I created a weird chapel here. There were rosemary bushes in the hall, ghostly voices...' The latter were engineered by musicians Vince Clarke (of Erasure) and Martyn Ware (formerly of Heaven 17), who are providing the soundtrack for a piece in progress: a collaboration with philosopher Theodore Zeldin that will 'evoke different forms of humanity - not anthropomorphically, via portraits, but via objects.' As for the gallery's decor, de Monchaux's style is particularly evident in the sepulchral bathroom. Panelled in dark wood, its window is framed by velvet curtains tied back with chainmail evening bags and peacock feathers, its gothic vibe given an added frisson by a framed sickly green beetle. At the heart of this home is a paradox. The art might be in a state of constant flux, but there's a strong sense of Berning and de Monchaux having firmly put down roots. Much of their functional furniture is integrated into the architecture, including the dining table, which is fixed to the floor, as is an L-shaped sofa incorporating drawers. How to square this contradiction? 'Well, the simple furniture allows the art to take precedence,' they say, 'and, anyway, we're not knick-knacky people.' \u00b7 Hope Springs Eternal is at Dominic Berning, 1 Hoxton Street, London N1 (020 7739 4222)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
