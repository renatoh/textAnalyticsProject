Pinecrest nursing home, a privately run facility in the town of Bobcaygeon, Ontario, has emerged as one of the country\u2019s deadliest Covid-19 hotspots. Twenty-seven of the home\u2019s 65 residents have succumbed to the disease, and the spouse of one resident, who often volunteered at the home, has also died. But it was not until last week \u2013 after 16 deaths \u2013 that sick residents at the home were finally separated from healthy residents, according to CBC News. A respiratory outbreak at Pinecrest was first declared on 18 March. Three residents tested positive for Covid-19 shortly afterwards, and in the following weeks the virus tore through the home, overwhelming residents and infecting dozens of staff. The layout of the facility complicated efforts to contain the outbreak. Pinecrest has a mix of private and semi-private rooms to house residents, as well as shared rooms that sleep four people. In some cases, however, only a curtain separated residents, even though staff told families that sick residents had been isolated, CBC reported. On 20 March, a media release from Pinecrest and the local health authority said residents had all been isolated into separate areas with meals served on trays and staff using personal protective equipment. Following the fatalities, a reshuffle in the facility has finally allowed staff to move healthy residents to their own rooms. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason why we actually have the space now. Because we\u2019ve lost \u2026 residents,\u201d Sarah Gardiner, a nurse at Pinecrest, told CBC News. \u201cBut before, there really was not the space to do that. It would have been an impossibility, I think.\u201d Twenty-four staff have tested positive, and many of the residents are also presumed to have the virus. \u201cIt\u2019s a war zone \u2013 more than one nurse has said that,\u201d Dr Michelle Snarr, Pinecrest\u2019s medical director, told reporters. \u201cI feel like a field commander in a war.\u201d Like other countries around the world, Canada has grappled with a surge in coronavirus cases in long-term care homes across the country, whose residents are among the most vulnerable to the virus. On Tuesday, Canada reported 17,063 coronavirus cases and 345 deaths, nearly half of which have come from long-term care homes. Some facilities have scaled up their precautionary measures, including fever checks for workers entering, and preventing care aides and cleaning staff from working at multiple locations. Provincial leaders have pledged millions of dollars in support and promised to hire more staff. Quebec\u2019s premier, Fran\u00e7ois Legault, said 519 of the province\u2019s 2,200 facilities had recorded a coronavirus case. In Ontario, 67 residents have died and 51 long-term care homes are battling cases. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing happening to our seniors and in our long-term care homes \u2026 is hard to process, it\u2019s hard to comprehend and it\u2019s hard to deal with,\u201d the Ontario premier, Doug Ford, told reporters. The unfolding tragedy in Bobcaygeon has also struck a deeper note with many Canadians because of its location. The town, a bucolic retreat for Ontarians looking to escape city life, was immortalised in song by Canada\u2019s most celebrated band, the Tragically Hip. Released in 1999, the song Bobcaygeon has become the most enduring hit from the band\u2019s extensive catalogue. As the coronavirus situation worsened over the weekend, the guitarist in a Tragically Hip cover band called on Canadians to sing Bobcaygeon from their front porches as a way of supporting the hard-hit community. \u201cAll I saw was bad news the last few weeks,\u201d said Richard Kyle. \u201cBut now I\u2019ve literally spent 24 hours watching people sing Bobcaygeon. The outpouring of support is coming everywhere.\u201d The effort has helped raise more than $70,000CAD (\u00a340,000) in donations for the Bobcaygeon relief fund. \u201cI know all my neighbours in Bobcaygeon. They all know me,\u201d said Kyle. \u201cAnd whenever there\u2019s a problem, the community steps up.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
