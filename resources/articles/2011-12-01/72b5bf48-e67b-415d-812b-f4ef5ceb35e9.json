Pardew suggested that the Portuguese is naive in his continuing battle with the media and some of English football's prominent figures, with the Newcastle United manager believing Villas-Boas's recent outbursts indicate he is struggling with the pressures of the Premier League. Informed that Villas-Boas had dismissed Pardew's claims that David Luiz should have been sent off during Chelsea's 3-0 win at Newcastle on 3 December, the Magpies manager said: \"Well sometimes when you've had a defeat you have to find certain reasons why you've had that defeat and you voice those concerns. But when you have a victory it's nice to be a bit more respectful and bit more honourable in saying: 'Well OK we won the game but decisions went our way'. \"And that's what I did at Manchester United [on 26 November]. I said it wasn't a penalty [awarded to his team that allowed a draw] but we accept it and that's it. I think it would be more honourable of him if he'd accepted that Luiz should have got sent off, like the referee did.\" Pardew also claimed that David Luiz's continued presence may have led to injuries to Steven Taylor and Danny Guthrie as they would have had to exert themselves less against 10 men. But Villas-Boas, who has also reacted angrily to Gary Neville's criticism of David Luiz on Sky Sports, said of Pardew: \"Nobody tried to focus on the fact that maybe Demba Ba was offside under Luiz's challenge. Alan Pardew made a big scandal out of it, but the guy is offside. Maybe Pardew was lucky. He got a free-kick that Ryan Taylor could have put in the back of the net, and I got a yellow card and a player suspended. This is a manager making a big scandal, saying that we got their player injured because David Luiz wasn't sent off. Come on.\" Asked if Pardew was surprised Villas-Boas reacted like that, he said: \"A little bit yes, and when I look at my stats of my players \u2013 Steven Taylor put more work rate and effort into that game than any game he's played this season. Did that maybe factor in the fact he got an injury to his achilles? Maybe it did. If they [Chelsea] had 10 men he might not need to work so hard. I'm not saying that the guy didn't get sent off and it related to his injury. But I'm saying because we were forcing the game there was a factor of that and its foolish to ignore. \"But the guy is new to our country, he's new to our press, and I think he's under a bit of pressure and I think maybe he could throw a little bit more respect at it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
