Later that year, after orchestrating the opera back in the Russian countryside, he felt moved to write this string sextet, the Souvenir de Florence , its adagio ranking among the most touching music even his high romanticism ever wrought. This lush performance by the Amsterdam Sinfonietta is coupled with a rare chance to hear Verdi's only instrumental composition, also steeped in Italian warmth and charm. \u00b7 To order Souvenir de Florence for \u00a314.99 incl. p&amp;p, call the Observer Music Service on 0870 066 7813"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
