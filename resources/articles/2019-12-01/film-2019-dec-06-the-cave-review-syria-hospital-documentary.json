If there is a chink of hope here it\u2019s Amani Ballour, the hospital\u2019s manager, a paediatrician in her late 20s. \u201cI know this life is tough. But it\u2019s honest,\u201d she says. Her deep sense of purpose is humbling \u2013 it carries her through hellish days treating dozens of bloodied and badly injured children. Her gentleness with patients is desperately moving, too. The hospital is nicknamed the Cave because of its subterranean network of tunnels. When bombing attacks by the Syrian army and Russian jets are at their worst, patients are evacuated to underground operating theatres and wards for safety. Ballour\u2019s colleagues include the urbane surgeon, Salim, who plays classical concerts on his iPhone during operations (his own hands beautifully mimicking the conductor), and a warm, funny nurse who cooks up vats of rice for staff. I suspect Fayyad has exercised restraint in his editing of the carnage as victims of massacre after massacre are brought in, but it remains harrowing. Children gasp for breath after a chemical attack; a baby chokes on a piece of rubble; a mother wails over the body of her son. The film\u2019s footage was shot by three cameramen inside the hospital and smuggled out of Syria. Fayyad, who now lives in Denmark, shows the everyday sexism Ballour encounters in her work. A patient\u2019s husband bluntly tells her that a woman\u2019s place is in the home. She\u2019s livid: \u201cNo one can tell me what to do.\u201d Perhaps Fayyad is making a point about a culture of aggressive masculinity. Assad is himself a trained ophthalmologist \u2013 a doctor who bombs hospitals. To say The Cave would break anyone\u2019s heart feels flimsy. Like Ballour, it has a purpose: to focus the world\u2019s attention on the suffering of Syrian people. \u2022 The Cave is released in the UK on 6 December."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
