She has enjoyed a 50-year career, becoming internationally famous in 1997 thanks to her participation in the Grammy-winning Buena Vista Social Club album. Her latest tour finds her in a congenial mood, leading a razor-sharp 14-piece band in a romping recital of music from last year's acclaimed solo long-player. Showmanship and physical spectacle were kept to a minimum, with the back-line brass players dressed in plain black outfits and Portuondo herself shuffling almost wearily about the stage, rubbing her eyes as if she had just got out of bed. Tres player Gilberto Oviedo was the only person who seemed remotely interested in showmanship. He danced affectionately with the leading lady and played his guitar on the back of his head, all the while looking like a tall light bulb in his shiny white suit. The absence of visual excitement sharpened our focus on the music, which comprised a mixture of up-beat carnival and slow weepy laments. Although the faster riff-based material was thrillingly honed, it was the ballads that most effectively showcased Portuondo's talents. Her elastic voice negotiated some truly devious melodies with ease, somehow managing to sound joyful and heartbroken at the same time. This emotional ambiguity is a common feature of Cuban music, thanks to the summery charm of the brass arrange ments, but it's a knife edge that Portuondo walks with particular skill. The faster pieces allowed the band to demonstrate their mastery of audience control. Deploying strategic crescendos to generate sudden rushes of euphoria, they had people jumping spontaneously out of their seats all night, and their child-like love of applause was a joy to behold. Portuondo had the endearing habit of getting the audience to clap at least twice during each of the musicians' solos, and by the end all the band members seemed to be permanently gesturing at each other, as if anxious that someone's efforts might go unrewarded. There were not just cheers but laughs too, generated mainly by Oviedo, who pretended to forget important guitar breaks before playing them in all the wrong places with a huge, cheeky smile. The concert ended in a surge of goodwill with some spectacularly out-of-tune audience members being allowed to sing Besame Mucho solo while the diva on stage smiled indulgently. \u0095 At the Royal Festival Hall, London SE1 (020-7960 4242), tonight."}, "isHosted": false}}}
