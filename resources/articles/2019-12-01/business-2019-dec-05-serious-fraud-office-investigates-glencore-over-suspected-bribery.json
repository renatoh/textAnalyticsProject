The SFO said \u201cit is investigating suspicions of bribery in the conduct of business by the Glencore group of companies, its officials, employees, agents and associated persons\u201d. In a statement, the \u00a330bn company added: \u201cGlencore has been notified today that the Serious Fraud Office has opened an investigation into suspicions of bribery in the conduct of business of the Glencore group.\u201d Glencore, which is listed on the London stock exchange but has its headquarters in Baar, Switzerland, said it would cooperate with the investigation. Its share price fell by 9% on the news to close at 216.9p, a three-year low. The company is the world\u2019s biggest commodity trader, buying and selling everything from oil to cotton, wheat and sugar. It operates in more than 50 countries and also has a significant mining operation for gold, silver, platinum, nickel, iron and aluminium. The announcement of the SFO probe is the latest setback for Glencore, which is already being investigated by the US Department of Justice for alleged money laundering and corruption in Nigeria, Venezuela and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Africa\u2019s biggest copper producer, dating back to 2007. The announcement of a UK enquiry had been widely expected in mining circles, following a Bloomberg report in May that stated that the SFO was preparing to open a formal bribery investigation into Glencore and its work with Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler and the leader of DRC. Gertler\u2019s notoriety in the DRC, which is rich in resources but riven by conflict, spans nearly two decades. He is reported to have made billions from being the unofficial gatekeeper to natural resources deals in the central African country. His friendship with the nation\u2019s former president Joseph Kabila \u2013 who was head of state from 2001 until earlier this year \u2013 has long been a source of controversy. Gertler was cited by a 2001 UN investigation that said he had given Kabila $20m to buy weapons to equip his army against rebel groups in exchange for a monopoly on the country\u2019s diamonds. The Israeli was also named in a 2013 Africa Progress Panel report that said a string of mining deals struck by companies linked to him had deprived the country of more than $1.3bn in potential revenue. In 2017, leaked documents that formed part of the Panama Papers investigation showed how Glencore had secretly loaned tens of millions of dollars to Gertler after it enlisted him to secure a controversial mining agreement in the DRC. The tycoon has repeatedly stated that all allegations of illegal behaviour are \u201cfalse and without any basis whatsoever\u201d, that he \u201crejects them absolutely\u201d, and that he transacts business \u201cfairly and honestly, and strictly according to the law\u201d. Glencore has also developed a controversial reputation of its own. The company was founded in 1974 by the commodities trader and financier Marc Rich, who in 1983 was indicted on charges described by the then US attorney for New York, Rudolph Giuliani, as \u201cthe biggest tax evasion case in United States history\u201d. He was also charged with buying millions of barrels of oil from Iran during the 1979-81 hostage crisis, flouting a ban on \u201ctrading with the enemy\u201d. He fled to Switzerland and remained on the FBI\u2019s most-wanted list until he was controversially pardoned by Bill Clinton in the final hours of his presidency in 2001. By then, Rich had long lost control of the company following a management buyout in 1993. Under its billionaire chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg, the company grew to become the world\u2019s biggest commodity trader, supplying the raw materials used in products from cars to smartphones. When it floated on the London stock exchange in May 2011 it was valued at \u00a338bn but the shares, which were then priced at 530p each, have never been worth as much since. Many of Glencore\u2019s executives have left in the past year. This week, Glasenberg hinted that he could leave the company soon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
