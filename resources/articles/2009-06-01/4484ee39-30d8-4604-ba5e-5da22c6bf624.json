Every time Shane Williams takes to the field there can be no escape, even for someone with his twinkling feet. He can run more elusively than anyone, but he cannot hide. These days, opponents lie in wait, grimly determined to turn the tables on the flea-sized irritant. Accordingly, if the prolific Wales winger were to pick a soundtrack which summed up his 2009 Lions tour so far, it would be the darkly ominous theme tune from Jaws. Tonight's game against the local Sharks at the Absa Stadium is the moment of truth. If Williams is to face South Africa on Saturday week, the time has come to relight the fuse. The permanence of class is often discussed but form can be elusive even when you are the International Rugby Board world player of the year. Lions tours are about hitting the ground running and this time out the 32-year-old has landed with a frustratingly soft plop. This evening will be his third start on the trip but he has so far done little to suggest that Ireland's Tommy Bowe and Ugo Monye of England are behind him in the queue for a Test starters' spot. The 5ft 7in Osprey, who has played seven times against the Springboks for Wales and lost each time, arrived in the country with a sore throat and in the knowledge that his wife, Gail, is due to give birth to their second child two days after the final Test, which is on 4 July. The interception try he presented to the Cheetahs last week at a crucial time in a close match cannot have helped ease his state of mind. He confessed to finding it \"hard\" to watch Monye and Bowe score two tries each in the 74\u201310 win against the Golden Lions in Johannesburg last Wednesday \u2013 an observation which was cut from his tour blog by cautious press officers. When Williams cannot even sidestep the censors there really is a problem. Yet talk to any of his coaches or colleagues and they are adamant that the slump will end sooner rather than later. After all, when a player has scored 46 tries in 67 Tests for Wales, there is little point in panicking. \"I won't let it bother me or hang my head in shame,\" said Williams, reflecting on that late intercept in Bloemfontein. \"I'm trying my best to get involved in games, it's just the way it goes. No way am I going to feel sorry for myself.\" The Lions' defence coach, Shaun Edwards, who also works with Wales, said: \"I said to [Shane] that players like him who play right in the faces of the opposition are going to get passes picked off at certain times. He has to continue to do that and not be scared, not go back to his wing and hope the game passes him by. He's got to force his way into the match. In training this week he had a real spring in his step and I'm really looking forward to watching him play.\" Trying too hard is a condition all professional sportsmen encounter in the end but if Williams keeps it too simple, people will assume he has not rediscovered his spark. His best hope tonight is that the forwards hit the breakdown with the extra dynamism the management are aiming for and thus generate the quick ball which presents their attacking backs with an extra half-yard of space. \"When Shane starts running, you just hope and pray someone can get hold of him quickly,\" said the former Springbok wing Stefan Terblanche, who was once an Ospreys team-mate of Williams and who will line up against him as the Sharks' full-back tonight. \"He is a fantastic runner and one on one he is almost impossible to stop. Shane has proved himself through and through for Wales and I would pretty much select him for the Lions Test side now ... it is a no-brainer. I guess he needs to show a little bit of form going into the Tests but his class is permanent.\" Williams's regional team-mate Mike Phillips, who will tonight form the Lions half-back partnership with Ronan O'Gara of Ireland, would enjoy nothing more than the return of the kind of form which earned Williams a Lions Test jersey in 2005, after he danced his way to five tries in a midweek match against Manawatu in Palmerston North. \"Shane was the world's best player last year and he can turn any game on its head from anywhere on the pitch,\" the Wales scrum-half said. \"You certainly want to be playing alongside him and he's also a great bloke off the field.\" Even great blokes sometimes get the blues, though. Williams's problems can be traced back to the Six Nations, when he started brightly against Scotland before injuring an ankle. That put him out of the England game and hindered him in the defeat by France in Paris. By his own admission he \"lost a bit of confidence\" from that spell and it has not been entirely rebuilt. What a bonus it would be for the Lions if their wizard were to rekindle his special kind of magic beside the Indian Ocean tonight."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
