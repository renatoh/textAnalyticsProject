This is a stupid argument. First, because the model at its fulcrum, Lily Cole (key quote: \"I'm fine. I'm healthy. I eat\") is a naturally slim person, at the very slimmest age of her life (18); what are you going to do next, arrest her for not having any wrinkles? Second, while she may be an unrealistic role model for 30-year-olds, who cares? We're women, not lemmings; we can tell the difference between models and role models. Third, because this insincere \"we only want healthy models\" chest-beating is revisited every year. They are no better than Lib Dems and their perennial, \"shall we really charge 50p in the pound?\" taxation debate. Chums, how soon do you honestly think this will be a matter of pressing importance to you? And, talking of which, do you not think Menzies Campbell is awfully svelte? I worry sometimes that he's not a realistic role model for other party leaders ... The other annual discussion of the fashion shows is who's in the front row. I have never known a year in which this row is not dissected so normal people get to know what Brenda Wurzit looks like, who edits Something or Other. That will be your basic front-row story - here are some people who, if you were in the know, you'd know. I can think of one instance in which this would be of use to someone who wasn't in fashion. Last year, in Paris, someone from Peta threw a pie in Anna Wintour's face. If you'd been walking past and didn't know who she was, you'd think she was just another thin Parisienne who'd happened to get caught in some pie-flinging crossfire. The whole narrative would have been totally lost on you. Otherwise, really, it couldn't matter less. Then there are the famous people in the front row - they can be properly famous (Posh Spice) or not really famous (Diana Ross's daughter, say), but this is like one of those puzzle magazines. If you take their position in the row and plot it against the designer's standing, you will be able to map the celebrity's standing in the world. Likewise you can pinpoint the standing of the label by the fact that a person of high standing has chosen to sit in the front row, unbidden. This, while less controversial than the whole thin thing, is much more telling on an anthropological level. Certainly there is a practical boon to sitting at the front, as there would be in a sporting contest: you can see what's going on. In fact, a fashion show is more like a private view than a sport, since those with a serious interest will examine the wares in greater depth later on (in photos and suchlike), so really this opening parade is about performance and status. It has as much to do with actual fashion as a party conference has to do with the manifesto (the pesky Lib Dems insisted just yesterday that the two are linked, but Menzies has had his head addled by a dangerously low blood-sugar level). In what other event would one's physical position in a crowd be so thoroughly stratified, and pored over, and trigger such career-ending slights, or career-making statements? These days in wide-flung diplomatic gatherings where cultural sophistication varies hugely, seating is important because you never know how the man from Uzbekistan is going to take things. Otherwise you'd be looking to the distant past for anything similar - the Henrician court as described by Wyatt; Parisian high society, as described by Laclos. I believe one's position at the bedside of Louis XIV was of paramount importance, and could be the difference between wealth and bankruptcy. In other words, this kind of kudos-choreography is amazingly silly - silly enough to have been defunct for nearly 300 years. If the fashion world thinks itself a role model to the rest of us, I'd say size 0 clothes horses are the least of its worries. \u00b7 zoe_williams @ntlworld.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
