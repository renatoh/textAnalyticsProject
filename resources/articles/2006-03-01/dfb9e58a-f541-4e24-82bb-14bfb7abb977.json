He had been wearing them that day when he punched a ball through cover to win India their first Test in Australia in 22 years. He made 233 and 72 not out in that Test and was so moved by the moment, his colleague Virender Sehwag later revealed, that he could not get himself to discard his whites. The story reveals a lot about a man who otherwise seems so drearily normal, like a geek who did well at cricket instead of maths. Dravid, though, has been as much a player of passion as he has been one of method during an astonishing career in which he averages 58 - and he is playing his 100th Test in Mumbai. He will be hoping he is not remembered, in this landmark appearance, for getting it wrong by opting to bowl first when he won the toss. Dravid has been through two entirely different phases of Indian cricket and captains them as they head into a third. He has been a talismanic figure. When Dravid entered Test cricket, with an assured 95 at Lord's in 1996, India were a mediocre team, winning often at home, but rarely outside the sub-continent. For decades, with only a few blips of excellence, India had been a side with an inferiority complex, whose bowlers rarely took 20 wickets and whose batsmen rarely gave their bowlers runs to bowl with. Sunil Gavaskar was a quintessential product of this era. He could occupy the crease for long hours, with playing out time often more critical than scoring at a quick pace. Dravid was in that mould, a gatherer more than a hunter, an immovable object against forces that so often seemed irresistible to his team-mates. Dravid quickly became the lynchpin of a team - who had, until then, relied largely on Sachin Tendulkar - earning himself the nickname of 'The Wall'. An early masterpiece - 148 and 81 against South Africa and Allan Donald in Johannesburg in 1997, cemented him in the number three position, where he averages an astonishing 61.5. As the 1990s came to an end, India and Dravid were limited by attitude, not ability. They needed to win overseas to become a credible threat and Dravid had to become more than a stonewaller. He had to liberate himself, and so did India. Towards the end of 2000, a new wind started blowing in Indian cricket. Sourav Ganguly took over as captain, John Wright came in as coach, with one man infusing the team with self-belief, the other with a modern work ethic. Dravid became the man who stepped up at key moments and made them seem seminal. In the Kolkata Test of 2001, against Steve Waugh's Australia, Dravid played the most famous supporting role in Indian cricket, making 180 to VVS Laxman's 281 as India came back from following on to winning the Test and, later, the series. He made a match-saving 144 not out in Georgetown against West Indies the next year, before a remarkable tour to England, where he spent more than 30 hours at the crease and made three centuries. There were two landmark series in the next few months. First, India almost won in Australia, with Dravid's performance in Adelaide the highlight of the tour. Then they won against arch rivals Pakistan, with Dravid's 270 in Rawalpindi in April 2004 the series-winning innings. He has averaged 66 since Tendulkar was replaced as captain in 2000, an indication of how critical he has been. In Tests that India have won, Dravid averages 79. Dravid also became the India one-day team's regular wicketkeeper in 2002, giving the side the extra options they desperately needed. He reinvented himself as a one-day batsman during this period, moving from an anchor at number three to a finisher at number five or six. He later relinquished wicketkeeping duties when Mahendra Singh Dhoni emerged, but he averaged 44 while keeping wicket. At his best, Dravid mixes orthodox classicism with the wristy flourish associated with the subcontinent. He can whip a ball outside off to the midwicket boundary, just as he can reverse-sweep a left-arm spinner to the third-man boundary. He takes his Test cricket very seriously and it is not all about batting now. India are lucky to have him, even if he did choose the wrong option yesterday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
