When 16 September, 1970 Where The streets of Rome after Lazio v Arsenal What happened Not strictly an on-field brawl although the heat had certainly built up during a 2-2 Fairs Cup game (Arsenal went on to win 2-0 at home). The spark was a post-match banquet that ended with Lazio players starting on the Gunners - presumably over their ignorance of dry white wine. The violence spilled on to the streets, with manager Bertie Mee joining in, allegedly grabbing his Italian counterpart by the lapels and throwing an effective left hook. Mee's intervention, it is said, bonded the squad; by the end of the season Arsenal had won their first Double. Handbag rating 3 KO'd and called up When 23 October, 1969 Where Estudiantes v AC Milan, Intercontinental Cup Second Leg What happened The game with enough violence to persuade European teams that the Intercontinental Cup was not such a good idea after all. After only 18 minutes Milan forward Prati was knocked unconscious by two Estudiantes players. Suffering from mild concussion, shock and amnesia he played on for another 20 minutes. Nestor Combin, an Argentine playing for Milan, was the next for treatment. Called a Judas by his countrymen, he received an elbow from Aguirre Suarez, and left the pitch covered in blood. He was then arrested in the changing room for failing to complete his national service. Handbag rating 4 First time around When 20 October, 1990 Where Manchester United v Arsenal, Old Trafford What happened The original battle of Old Trafford was the also the biggest with 21 players involved. Only David Seaman abstained - he was believed to be keeping an eye on his back post. The timeline of events was as follows: Brian McClair and Tony Adams swap studmarks; Nigel Winterburn commits a crude tackle; Anders Limpar and Denis Irwin square up; everybody else joins in; Paul Ince shoves Limpar into an advertising hoarding. Both clubs were charged after the game and had league points docked by the FA. Such a stern lesson meant that these disgraceful scenes never occurred again. As if. Handbag rating 4 1/2 Lights out When 27 June, 1954 Where Brazil v Hungary, Berne What happened Not to be confused with the Battle of Bannockburn, which was an actual battle, the battle of Berne was simply a fight between two of the greatest football teams in the world - even if its tactics were military in their precision. There were 42 free-kicks, two penalties, four bookings and three players sent off, two of whom had to be escorted from the pitch by police. The Brazilians, particularly outraged by events, decided to hide in the Hungarian dressing room, turn the lights off and wait. Mayhem, with fists, bottles and boots all flying, swiftly ensued. Handbag rating 5 Three legs bad When 4 November, 1967 Where Celtic v Racing Club, Intercontinental Cup playoff What happened The two-legged final, drawn 2-2, had proven quite rancorous, so both clubs agreed to hold a peace summit in Montevideo: armed police were on the pitch within half an hour of kick-off. There were five sendings off: Basile for a fight with John Clark; Bobby Lennox for a foul he was 40 yards away from; Rulli for being elbowed in the face by John Hughes; Jimmy Johnstone for elbowing somebody else entirely. The final dismissal was Bertie Auld, who refused to leave the field. So the ref let him play on. 'I would like to come back here for another go,' Jock Stein said. Handbag rating 5 When mascots attack When 7 November, 1998 Where Bristol City v Wolverhampton Wanderers, First Division What happened The suspicion has always been that mascots are just like footballers, only with furry costumes instead of talent. And so it proved on this autumn day when Wolfie the Wolf went to it with the Three Little Pigs in a modern reworking of the classic fairy tale ('you've seen the straw houses, this time it's haymakers'). Wolfie, of Wolves, taunted the three pigs, of local double-glazing firm Coldseal, who in return lamped the Wolf. This inevitably dragged in the City Cat, of Bristol City, and unconventional children's entertainment ensued. Handbag rating 2 Star studded When 12 February, 2000 Where Leeds United v Tottenham Hotspur, Premiership What happened Amazing to imagine that two teams featuring the dainty skills of Lee Bowyer and Mauricio Taricco could tumble into a near-riot, but tumble they did. It all started when young Bowyer slid studs-first into Stephen Clemence's chest just after half-time. Tim Sherwood stepped in, followed by Chris Perry and then the rest of both teams. Referee Dermot Gallagher curiously decided to keep everyone on the field, which simply encouraged Alan Smith to dig his elbow into Taricco, and Ian Harte to stamp on Perry, who punched him back. If you want a video of this game, you'll find one under the counter. Handbag rating 3 Karate kids, too When 1 April, 1997 Where Toros Neza v Jamaica, Toluca, Mexico What happened It must have seemed a great idea, staging an international friendly against a Mexican club side on April Fool's day. By the time the 19th minute had passed and Toros midfielder German Arangio had responded to a bad tackle by punching his opponent, opinions may have changed. What followed was five minutes of anarchy as Jamaica's players retreated from the pitch and returned with bricks and broken glass. The Mexicans duly responded with wrestling moves and karate kicks; the match was then called off. Jamaica coach Rene Simoes blamed his players' behaviour on naivety at international level. Nobody believed him. Handbag rating 5 Going to the zoo When 22 July, 1966 Where England v Argentina, Wembley What happened The Argentines muttered about conspiracy, and Alf Ramsey talked confidently about 'animals' after this quarter-final that had promised a great match, but will be remembered for a long, long walk. After presiding over a team performance notable only for constant dirty challenges, Argentine captain Antonio Rattin decided to get the German referee involved too. After giving him one mouthful too many, complaining at the booking of a teammate, Rudolf Kreitlin sent him off for 'violence of the tongue' (even though he didn't understand any Spanish). Rattin then took the best part of 10 minutes to leave the pitch. England won thanks to a single Geoff Hurst goal. Handbag rating 2 See Naples and die When 8 February, 1967 Where Napoli v Burnley, Fairs Cup What happened Leading 3-0 from the first leg, Burnley arrived in Napoli to the 'Welcome to Hell' treatment. 'In Naples,' reported the Gazzetta dello Sport, 'visiting players are put through a mincing machine at the end of a game and their remains roasted on a spit.' And so, after Burnley keeper Harry Thomson had kept an outstanding clean sheet to win the tie, he was first spat at, then punched by Alberto Orlando. This inspired Clarets reserve keeper Adam Blacklaw to join in, taking on several Napoli players and throwing one down a set of stairs. At this point the police intervened. Burnley were hustled out of the ground and back to the airport with an escort of an armoured lorry and nine military jeeps.
