When the pedal hit the floor, though, there was no explosion of speed, and instead of a revolution, there was victory for tradition, as Rail Link, a three-year-old winner of the Prix Niel gave trainer Andr\u00e9 Fabre a record-breaking seventh victory, holding off the fast finish of Pride at the incredible local starting price of 24-1. Rail Link was such an Identikit winner of a modern Arc - the right age, the right trainer and the winner of the right prep-race - that he was an 8-1 chance with British bookmakers. His odds were inflated to three times that on the PMU, the French Tote, however, as thousands of Japanese backers poured millions of euros into the \"machine\", regardless of the fact that Tote systems ensure that the more you put on, the less you get back. \"It's the craziest betting race I've ever seen in my life,\" Mike Dillon, Ladbrokes' veteran racecourse PR man, said as Rail Link was led back to the winner's enclosure yesterday, and he has seen plenty. \"We were laying 5-2 about Deep Impact in London, and he started at an industry price of 9-4 in Britain, but at the same moment, there were people here queueing in lines a quarter of a mile long to back him when the screen is showing him at 1-10.\" Deep Impact had earned his huge following from Japan with 10 victories in 11 previous starts, generally using hold-up tactics before coming with a blistering turn of foot in the final two furlongs. He was close up from the off yesterday, though, as Irish Wells took the eight-runner field - one of the smallest ever in the race - along at a moderate pace. Yutaka Take, Deep Impact's jockey, briefly took the lead at the top of the straight, as Shirocco and Hurricane Run, both of them, like the winner, trained by Fabre, attempted to maintain a challenge. Both have a preference for some cut in the ground, though, and neither could make their presence felt on going that was unusually fast for Paris in October. Instead, it was Stephane Pasquier and Rail Link who quickened past Deep Impact at the furlong pole, and the Japanese colt had nothing to offer in response. Pride, who had been patiently ridden by Christophe Lemaire, was closing the gap rapidly at the line, but Rail Link stayed on to win by a neck, with Deep Impact another half-length away in third. The decision to send Deep Impact straight to the Arc without a prep-race is one that Yasuo Ikee, his trainer, may regret as he reflects on yesterday's race, while a proper pacemaker might also have made a difference to the result. On an afternoon when Mandesha broke the 10-furlong course record, the Arc was run seven seconds below record time, and Deep Impact's famous turn of foot was a blunt weapon as a result. Even when you have everything in your favour, though, it still takes something special to beat Andr\u00e9 Fabre, in this race above all. All but one of his seven winners have been three-year-olds. Whether Fabre's record is measured by championships, big-race winners or sheer durability, he is quite clearly the finest trainer in Europe, and the equal, at least, of any trainer that modern racing on this continent has seen. \"It is always a big reward to win the Arc with a three-year-old against the older horses,\" Fabre said. \"He was always a laid-back horse and a big horse earlier in the year, so we gave him time. \"He had the right to be here, all three of my horses are superstars and like the others he is a Group One winner. He is finished for the year but Shirocco could still go to the Breeders' Cup.\" Ikee said afterwards that he hopes to return to Paris with Deep Impact next year for another attempt at the race. \"I thought he ran well today, but there were two better horses,\" Ikee said. \"I didn't expect him to be up with the pace, but he settled very well. I'm very proud of my horse, and full of admiration for the two who finished in front of him.\" Pride has now been beaten in three Arcs but got closer than ever this time, and her owner Sven Hanson said: \"She will retire at the end of the season. She could go for the Japan Cup and then on to Hong Kong.\" Kieren Fallon, who was trapped on the rails as the finish developed around him in the home straight, said that it had been \"a messy race, as they went no pace and the ground was too lively.\" Messy it may have been, not least from the point of view of the backers who placed so much faith, and money, behind the challenge of Deep Impact. For those who took advantage of the skewed market that faith created, though, there was a big winner at an even bigger price. Success for the Japanese colt would have been a historic moment for racing. Fabre-trained Arc winners at 24-1, however, are fairly historic too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
