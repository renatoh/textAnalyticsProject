Several times recently I've underestimated showers and got a soaking, and that's fine, but there are places I want to see a bit further afield and hope the weather holds a while longer. The air under tall trees is densely green and aquatic. There has been so much rain and the leaves are almost umbrella'd out so the humidity is trapped in a thick green light. Striking through the landscape are bright slashes of oilseed rape fields. They are subsidy yellow \u2013 a dazzling colour and sickly sweet scent of public money extravagantly poured into a countryside to reduce its wildlife and maximise profits. When other recent hysterias wane, perhaps there will be more scrutiny of the expenses we pay for ruining our own landscapes. The corporate colour of the oilseed rape runs counter to the current white pulse of spring as seen in the flowering may, wild garlic, cow parsley, stitchwort, jack-by-the-hedge and even horse chestnut. The air being so wet and heavy, the swallows skim low over Windmill Hill. So too do the first meadow brown butterflies I've seen this year. The number of butterflies has plummeted because of the cold wet weather and I fear for insect populations if this year follows recent disastrously wet Mays. Up on the steep slopes of Edge Wood, the wild garlic is just about peaking. The canopy of trees has now closed over the great, almost vertical lawns of white flower and the sexy, animal-like musk from their leaves. Inside the woods, deer and small birds stir the silence of the white on green heraldry. Slipping down narrow clay tracks through a snow-like haze, a breeze above from the east brings rain and it all sounds like water, a slow green tide flowing west."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
