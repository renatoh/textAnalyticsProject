The deposed champion, who wants two more winners to reach 200 for the year, was speaking for the first time after the decision of the Jockey Club to drop disrepute charges over allegations made by the News Of The World last March against him and his fellow rider John Egan. Fallon said: \"The pressure on me during the past few months has been colossal. I owe a huge debt of gratitude to my solicitor Christopher Stewart-Moore. I don't know how I would have got through the recent events without his help. \"But I can't wait for the new season to start when I want my jockeys' championship back from Frankie [Dettori].\" Meanwhile Jim Culloty returns after seven weeks due to a thumb injury to ride the Henrietta Knight-trained King Killone in the opening novice hurdle at Exeter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
