But after failing to come up with three points here for his fifth successive game, the fledgling Portsmouth manager faces a series of matches as big as any he was involved in during his days as coach at Chelsea. Next up is today's trip to Birmingham, a visit from Fulham and then a match at Blackburn. By then Rix may be regretting their failure to win this one, though in truth Pompey took a point from a game in which QPR did enough to win. Part of Rix's preparation for the visit of the bottom club was to open the floor to his players. The two penn'orth he got from Lee Bradbury was: \"We should steamroller teams for 15-20 minutes then, once they back off, we can play our football.\" The striker was as good as his word and with barely a minute gone he ducked into a corner from Lee Sharpe and turned the ball home. But the steamrolling stopped after 25 minutes and it all fell flat for Portsmouth. Rangers carved out several chances and Andy Thomson, who had what seemed a good goal disallowed in the first half, equalised in the second after Leon Knight's shot was parried. \"Three or four weeks ago we would have folded,\" said Ian Holloway, still to win as QPR's manager but who had the scant consolation of seeing his team climb off the bottom. \"You're going down with the Rangers,\" was the reaction of the visiting fans. With Pompey only two points above the safety mark, they may well be right. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
