The House passed a voting rights bill, with all but one Republican opposing the measure. The Guardian spoke to Alabama representative Terri Sewell, who represents Selma and parts of Montgomery and Birmingham, about why she\u2019s prioritizing voting rights. Duncan Hunter, the California Republican who pleaded guilty to misusing campaign funds for personal expenses said he\u2019s resigning for Congress. 2020 Tidbits Pete Buttigieg released some details about his work at McKinsey amidst growing scrutiny of his time there. Michael Bloomberg apologized after he called Cory Booker \u201cwell-spoken\u201d. Elizabeth Warren was the first candidate to release her medical records, including a note from her doctor saying she was \u201cin excellent health\u201d. Here\u2019s the full story on the White House declining its impeachment hearing invitation: Pete Buttigieg has released some details about his work at the consulting firm McKinsey but did not disclose the names of his clients. The South Bend, Indiana mayor, and 2020 presidential candidate worked at McKinsey for three years. In response to criticism that he hasn\u2019t been forthcoming about his time there, Buttigieg said he has signed a non-disclosure agreement preventing him from sharing more details. McKinsey has come under increased scrutiny this week after a New York Times/ProPublica investigation found that the firm helped Immigration and Customs Enforcement find \u201cdetention savings opportunities\u201d that included cutting spending on food and medical care for detained migrants. Earlier reports found that the firm worked with authoritarian governments counter to US interests. In a statement, Buttigieg called for \u201cMcKinsey to do the right thing in the name of transparency\u201d and release the names of his clients. He provided some details about his work, writing that in 2007, he \u201cserved a nonprofit health insurance provider for approximately three months, undertaking on-the-job training and performing analytical work as part of a team identifying savings in administration and overhead costs.\u201d In 2008, he worked for a grocery chain in Toronto, \u201canalyzing the effects of price cuts\u201d and a consumer goods retailer in Chicago \u201cto investigate opportunities for selling more energy-efficient home products in their stores\u201d. Subsequently, he researched \u2018opportunities to combat climate change through energy efficiency\u201d for a group of organizations that included the US Environmental Protection Agency, and later did similar work for a non-profit in California. Finally, he said he worked with the US government researching ways to increase employment and entrepreneurship in Iraq and Afghanistan. Buttigieg has previously touted his work with McKinsey as an asset, and a way to show that he understands business. The House passed a bill to grant greater federal oversight over state elections, restoring a key provision of the 1956 Voting Rights Act which was weakened by a 2013 Supreme Court decision. The legislation was approved 228-187, along party lines -- with all the House Republicans, bar one, opposed to it. The Voting Rights Advancement Act charges the Justice Department with greater oversight in states that repeatedly violate voting rights. It\u2019s unlikely that the measure will pass into law given Republican opposition in the Senate. Still, Democrats who have long-advocated for voting rights, and who are looking to demonstrate that they can still legislate while overseeing the impeachment inquiry, are celebrating today\u2019s incremental victory. Representative John Lewis of Georgia, who was beaten while demonstrating for voting rights in 1965, banged the gavel to mark the bill\u2019s passage. Alabama representative Terri Sewell, who introduced the bill, recently spoke with The Guardian about why voting rights are a priority. In what ways is the issue of voting rights personal for you, especially as someone who is from Selma? SEWELL: Growing up in Selma, Alabama, there was never a moment that I was not keenly aware of the sacrifice of those who came before me, and the pivotal role of my home in our nation\u2019s struggle for civil rights. Those stories did not have to be taught, as they are interwoven into the fabric of Selma. Their lessons of strength, resilience and deep patriotism have shaped me and opened doors of opportunity, for me and for so many others. For all of these reasons, voting rights are deeply personal to me. H.R. 4, which seeks to restore the Voting Rights Act of 1965, remains my signature piece of legislation, and I will continue to fight tirelessly until it is passed. In what ways are voting rights especially relevant now? During this deeply sobering moment in our nation\u2019s history, as we protect against further foreign interference in our elections, I believe it is more important than ever that we, as elected officials, are doing everything possible to ensure that our elections are conducted fairly and that every single American is given equal opportunity to cast their vote. Voting is the cornerstone of our democracy, and we must continue to invest in infrastructure and policies that help ensure that every single American can make their voice heard at the ballot box. What are your biggest concerns going into the 2020 elections when it comes to voting rights, and what, if anything, do you anticipate can be done going into the upcoming election? I am certainly concerned by the possibility of foreign interference and the Senate must take up the bills the House has passed to protect our election infrastructure from outside interference. I am equally concerned by the steps state legislatures across the country have taken \u2014 both before and since the November 2018 midterm elections \u2014 to limit access to the ballot box. Voting is a right, not a privilege, and it is paramount that we ensure access to all Americans, without allowing economic indicators or other challenging circumstances be a barrier. Do you foresee the VRAA passing in time to take effect before the 2020 election? Historically, the VRA has been supported by both parties; President Bush was proud to sign an extension into law in 2006. My hope is that history will extend to the VRAA, too. *** Follow The Guardian\u2019s special coverage of the systemic ways that voting rights are denied to so many Americans and how this will impact the US presidential elections: On Monday, the Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to allow the federal government to carry out four scheduled executions by reinstating the federal death penalty after a 16-year old. The Supreme Court just rejected the request \u2014 which means there won\u2019t be an execution on Monday. More context from The AP: Attorney General William Barr announced during the summer that federal executions would resume using a single drug, pentobarbital, to put inmates to death. U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan in Washington, D.C., temporarily halted the executions after some of the chosen inmates challenged the new execution procedures in court. Chutkan ruled that the procedure approved by Barr likely violates the Federal Death Penalty Act. The federal appeals court in Washington had earlier denied the administration\u2019s emergency plea to put Chutkan\u2019s ruling on hold and allow the executions to proceed. Federal executions are likely to remain on hold at least for several months, while the appeals court in Washington undertakes a full review of Chutkan\u2019s ruling. The Supreme Court has granted Donald Trump\u2019s request to block a congressional subpoena for his financial records from Deutsche Bank. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg delayed an appellate court\u2019s decision ordering Deutsche Bank and Capitol One to comply with subpoenas until 5pm on Friday, Dec. 13, giving the court considers granting an even longer delay and Trump\u2019s lawyers time to prepare a formal appeal. Trump has gone to great lengths to keep his financial records private. In a separate case, he\u2019s appealing to prevent the House Oversight Committee from obtaining financial records from his longtime accounting firm Mazars. Duncan Hunter, the Republican representative from California who plead guilty to misusing campaign funds, has announced he will be resigning from Congress. \u201cShortly after the Holidays, I will resign from Congress. It has been an honor to serve the people of California\u2019s 50th District, and I greatly appreciate the trust they have put in me over these last 11 years,\u201d Hunter said in a statement. Yesterday, the House Ethics Committee informed Hunter that he \u201cshould refrain from voting\u201d in the House of Representatives \u201cunless or until judicial or executive proceedings result in reinstatement of the presumption of innocence \u2026 or until the Member is reelected to the House after the date of such conviction.\u201d Hunter and his wife were charged with spending more $250,000 in campaign funds on personal costs including vacations, groceries and other bills. Michael Bloomberg apologized for calling Cory Booker \u201cwell-spoken\u201d. The late entrant to the 2020 presidential primaries said, \u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t have used the word, but I could just tell you he is a friend of mine. He is a Rhodes Scholar, which is much more impressive than my academic background. I envy him.\u201d In an interview with CBS This Morning\u2019s Gayle King, Bloomberg said, \u201cCory Booker endorsed me a number of times and I endorsed Cory Booker a number of times,\u201d Bloomberg told King. \u201cHe\u2019s very well-spoken. He\u2019s got some good ideas. It would be better the more diverse any group is. But the public is out there picking and choosing and narrowing down this field.\u201d That\u2019s it from me on the blog today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The White House announced it would not participate in Monday\u2019s impeachment hearing conducted by the House judiciary committee, slamming the inquiry as \u201ccompletely baseless.\u201d Trump said he spoke to the Saudi king about the shooting at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida, which left four people dead. Authorities said the shooter was a Saudi national studying aviation at the naval base, raising potential terrorism concerns. Trump asked the Supreme Court to block a court ruling ordering Deutsche Bank and Capitol One to hand over the president\u2019s financial records to congressional investigators. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, said in a New Yorker interview that Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t give a shit about what\u2019s good for our country\u201d as Democratic leadership moves toward drafting articles of impeachment. The House passed a measure endorsing a two-state Israeli-Palestinian solution, implicitly rebuking Trump\u2019s policies toward Israel. I will be away from the blog next week, so enjoy coverage from some of my wonderful Guardian colleagues. And stay tuned for more updates from Maanvi. The letter from White House counsel Pat Cipollone to the House judiciary committee does not explicitly say Trump will not participate in Monday\u2019s impeachment hearing, but an administration official reportedly confirmed he would not be sending a representative. In his letter notifying the House judiciary committee of Trump\u2019s decision not to send a representative to Monday\u2019s hearing, White House counsel Pat Cipollone slammed the impeachment inquiry as \u201ccompletely baseless.\u201d The letter concludes, \u201cWhatever course you choose, as the President has recently stated: \u2018if you are going to impeach me, do it now, fast, so we can have a fair trial in the Senate, and so that our Country can get back to business.\u2019\u201d The White House has decided it will not send a representative to the House judiciary committee\u2019s next impeachment hearing, which is scheduled for Monday. Trump\u2019s legal team was facing a 5 p.m. ET deadline to notify the committee of its decision. If the president had sent a representative, the lawyer would have been allowed to pose questions to those presenting the findings of the House intelligence committee, but some of Trump\u2019s allies have expressed concern about adding credibility to the proceedings. The White House is abour half an hour away from a 5 p.m. ET deadline to notify the House judiciary committee about whether Trump intends to send a representative to the panel\u2019s next impeachment hearing, which is taking place Monday. The hearing will allow the House intelligence committee to present the findings contained in its impeachment report, as well as the minority report compiled by the panel\u2019s Republican members. If Trump sends a representative, that lawyer would be allowed to pose questions to the staffers presenting the committee\u2019s findings. But sending a representative could also add credibility to the hearing, which the president is desperately trying to avoid. Trump was given the opportunity to send a lawyer to Wednesday\u2019s hearing featuring testimony from four legal experts, but he declined. As House Democrats move toward drafting articles of impeachment against Trump, the chamber\u2019s Democratic leadership is also advancing other measures, including a vote today on endorsing a two-state Israeli-Palestinian solution. The Washington Post reports: The measure was the latest example of House Democrats wading into the divisive realm of U.S.-Israel relations, an outgrowth of a broader controversy over the party\u2019s weakening support for Israel\u2019s right-wing government and its willingness to police seemingly anti-Semitic remarks by members of its ranks. The vote was 226 to 188, with five Republicans breaking ranks and joining Democrats in backing the resolution. The legislation declares that \u201conly the outcome of a two-state solution . . . can both ensure the state of Israel\u2019s survival as a Jewish and democratic state and fulfill the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people for a state of their own.\u201d The vote serves as an implicit rebuke of Trump\u2019s policies on Israel, coming a month after the president\u2019s administration announced the US would no longer consider Israeli settlements in the west bank to be illegal. But the vote was also notable for the four Democrats who opposed the measure from the left: congresswomen Rashida Tlaib, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar and Ayanna Pressley, the four freshman lawmakers known as \u201cthe Squad.\u201d Earlier today, Elizabeth Warren became the first Democratic presidential candidate to release her medical records, which included a note from her longtime doctor saying she was \u201cin excellent health.\u201d \u201cIn summary, Senator Elizabeth Warren is a very healthy 70 year old woman,\u201d Dr Beverly Woo wrote. \u201cThere are no medical conditions or health problems that would keep her from fulfilling the duties of the President of the United States.\u201d According to Woo, Warren is 5\u20198\u201d and weighs 129 pounds. Her only medical condition is hypothyroidism, which is treated with daily medication. \u201cShe exercises regularly and follows a healthy diet despite her very busy schedule,\u201d Woo wrote, adding that Warren doesn\u2019t have a history of smoking or drug use. The health of the Democratic presidential candidates has come under renewed scrutiny since Bernie Sanders, 78, suffered a heart attack in October. Sanders has returned to the campaign trail, but the episode raised questions about the wisdom of nominating a candidate in their 70\u2019s -- as Sanders, Warren and Joe Biden all are. At an Iowa campaign event yesterday, an elderly voter pressed Biden on his age. \u201cI\u2019m not sedentary,\u201d the former vice president angrily replied. \u201cAnd you want to check my shape, man, let\u2019s do push-ups together here, man. Let\u2019s run. Let\u2019s do whatever you want to do. Let\u2019s take an IQ test. Okay?\u201d Taking questions from voters at a campaign event in New Hampshire, Elizabeth Warren addressed her past claims of Native American ancestry, which have sparked criticism from the president and others. Warren began by saying she had learned about her family history from her parents, who had told her about her alleged Native American ancestry. The Massachusetts senators also directed voters to a Boston Globe investigation that found Warren\u2019s ethnicity claims were not a factor in her successful legal career. But the presidential candidate acknowledged she regretted the mistake. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have done it,\u201d Warren said. \u201cI am not a person of color, I am not a citizen of a tribe. And I have apologized for confusion I have caused.\u201d In addition to his complaints about water pressure, Trump also took aim at energy-efficient lightbulbs, which he said gave people an \u201corange look.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want an orange look,\u201d the president said. During Trump\u2019s roundtable on small businesses, the president also inexplicably touched on the issue of water pressure and complained about toilets not properly flushing. \u201cPeople are flushing toilets 10 times, 15 times as opposed to once,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey end up using more water.\u201d The president added he had asked the EPA to look into water standards. During Trump\u2019s roundtable on small businesses and his adminsitration\u2019s deregulation efforts, the president answered one question about the Naval Air Station shooting, declining to say whether authorities believed the incident was terrorism-related. \u201cThat\u2019s all being studied now,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe will be talking about it very soon. ...It will be a report and the report will come out very soon.\u201d The president ignored shouted questions about his response to the House judiciary committee on the impeachment inquiry, as his legal team faces a 5 p.m. ET deadline to let the panel know about participating in its Monday hearing. Donald Trump, fighting to keep details of his finances secret, asked the US Supreme Court this afternoon to prevent records held by Deutsche Bank AG and Capital One Financial Corp from being handed over to Democratic-led congressional panels. Trump\u2019s lawyers asked the high court to put a hold a December 3 ruling by the Manhattan-based 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals directing the two banks to comply with April subpoenas by the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee and Intelligence Committee for the financial records, Reuters writes. The record requests relate to the president, three of his children and the Trump Organization. Lawmakers have said the requests are part of a wider investigation into money laundering and foreign influence over US politics, especially relating to Trump-owned hotels. Deutsche Bank has long been a principal lender for Trump\u2019s real estate business. A 2017 disclosure form showed that Trump had at least $130 million of liabilities to the bank. Congressional investigators have already identified possible failures in Deutsche Bank\u2019s money laundering controls in its dealings with Russian oligarchs, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters. Trump has sought to keep his financial and tax records private. He broke with tradition by not releasing his tax returns as a candidate in 2016 and as president. Trump began his roundtable discussion on small businesses and his administration\u2019s deregulation efforts by echoing his tweet about having just spoken to the Saudi king regarding the shooting in Pensacola. \u201cIt\u2019s a horrible thing that took place, and we\u2019re getting to the bottom of it,\u201d the president told White House pool reporters. Authorities have said the attacker, who killed three people before being shot himself, was a Saudi national studying aviation at the naval base, raising possible terrorism concerns. Trump has just tweeted that he spoke to the king of Saudi Arabia following the shooting at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, which officials said was carried out by a Saudi aviation student at the base. Speaking to reporters moments ago, Florida governor Ron DeSantis said, \u201cThe government of Saudi Arabia needs to make things better for these victims. I think they\u2019re gonna owe a debt here given that this is one of their individuals.\u201d The shooting left at least four dead, including the gunman. Three Republican senators -- Lindsey Graham, Chuck Grassley and Ron Johnson -- have sent a letter requesting \u201cstaff-led transcribed interviews\u201d with former DNC consultant Alexandra Chalupa and Andrii Telizhenko, who was a political officer in the Ukrainian embassy. Chalupa\u2019s name came up repeatedly during the House intelligence committee\u2019s public impeachment trials because some of the president\u2019s Republican allies have tried to equate her work researching former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, which was aided by a handful of Ukrainian officials, with Russia\u2019s widespread efforts to meddle in the 2016 election. Trump\u2019s allies have pointed to Chalupa\u2019s work to bolster the baseless theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election, despite the testimony from Fiona Hill, the former top White House expert on Russia, that the allegations against Ukraine are a \u201cfictional narrative\u201d peddled by the Kremlin. Taking questions from reporters, White House spokesperson Hogan Gidley said he believes Rudy Giuliani is still the president\u2019s personal lawyer, even as the former New York mayor traveled to Europe this week to meet with former Ukrainian officials who helped spread baseless corruption allegations against Joe Biden. As reports emerged that the shooter at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola was a Saudi aviation student, raising possible concerns of terrorism, Trump said he had just received a briefing on the situation and had spoken to the governor of Florida. But the president offered no additional details on the possible motivation for the attack. \u201cWe are continuing to monitor the situation as the investigation is ongoing,\u201d Trump said in a tweet. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: A shooting at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida, left at least four dead, including the gunman. Authorities believe the attacker was a Saudi aviation student at the base, sparking concerns that the shooting was terrorism-related. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, said in a New Yorker interview that he believes Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t give a shit about what\u2019s good for our country\u201d as Democratic leadership moves toward drafting articles of impeachment. Michael Bloomberg was criticized for referring to fellow Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker as \u201cwell spoken,\u201d which many commentators said promoted a racist trope and belittled the New Jersey senator\u2019s intelligence. The blog will have much more coming up, so stay tuned. The gunman who killed at least three people at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Florida, was reportedly a Saudi national, which has sparked concerns that the attack may have been terrorism-related. Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer who has become a key figure in the impeachment inquiry, is now proposing a joint US-Ukrainian probe to investigate potential corruption by officials from both countries. The tweet, which is unlikely to generate any legitimate interest, comes the same week that Giuliani traveled to Europe to meet with former Ukrainian officials who helped spread baseless corruption allegations against Joe Biden. Congressman Eric Swalwell, a Democratic member of the House judiciary and intelligence committees, said Democrats don\u2019t have a timeline for impeachment but want to \u201cmove as expeditiously as possible.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no timeline, and that\u2019s intentional,\u201d Swalwell said. \u201cWe want to move based on the evidence and what our duty calls us to do. And we don\u2019t want to set artificial timelines. But because the upcoming elections and to make sure the process is fair, we\u2019re trying to move as expeditiously as possible and give the president an opportunity to participate.\u201d But Democrats seem on track to hold an impeachment vote before recessing for Christmas, as they have reportedly intended since formally launching the inquiry. On which articles of impeachment Democrats will pursue, Swalwell said, \u201cWe have to consider the best articles to tell the American people, \u2018This president needs to be held accountable.\u2019\u201d Congressman Justin Amash, an independent from Michigan who left the Republican Party over his opposition to Trump, said he was ready to vote for three articles of impeachment against the president. At least one House Democrat, Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, has said he plans to vote against the articles of impeachment, so Republicans will likely boast about their stance attracting (barely) bipartisan support. Joe Biden\u2019s super PAC, which just announced plans to air its first ad in Iowa this week, was formed in October as the former vice president struggled to keep up with the fundraising of fellow frontrunners like Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg. When Biden\u2019s campaign announced it was no longer opposed to supporters forming super PACs, the reversal was quickly denounced by some of the former veep\u2019s opponents, who have relied on grassroots donations to finance their operations. \u201cI don\u2019t need a super PAC,\u201d Sanders said at an Iowa town hall shortly after Biden announced the change. \u201cI am not going to be controlled by a handful of wealthy people. I will be controlled by the working people of this country.\u201d Unite the Country, the super PAC backing Joe Biden\u2019s presidential bid, plans to air its first ad in Iowa this week. The ad, entitled \u201cCourage,\u201d touts the former senator\u2019s work on the Violence Against Women Act and an assault weapons ban. \u201cMy mother had an expression. She used to say, \u2018Remember Joey, you\u2019re defined by your courage,\u2019\u201d Biden says in the ad. \u201dThe right to be educated. The right to marry who you choose. The right to live free from the threat of violence and fear. These are basic fundamental, universal human rights. Imagine. Imagine what we could build.\u201d The super PAC is spending at least $650,000 to air the ad in four major Iowa markets, with more buys expected later this month. Former secretary of state John Kerry, who endorsed Joe Biden\u2019s White House bid yesterday, is introducing the former vice president at a campaign event in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. \u201cThe only team that\u2019s worked more closely than us is Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin,\u201d Kerry joked. In his endorsement of Biden yesterday, Kerry argued the former veep had the character and experience needed to defeat Trump and reunite the country. \u201cThe world is broken. Our politics are broken. The country faces extraordinary challenges,\u201d Kerry told the Washington Post. \u201cAnd I believe very deeply that Joe Biden\u2019s character, his ability to persevere, his decency and the experiences that he brings to the table are critical to the moment. The world has to be put back together, the world that Donald Trump has smashed apart.\u201d More than 500 law professors have signed on to a letter accusing Trump of committing \u201cimpeachable conduct\u201d in his actions toward Ukraine. The Washington Post reports: The signers are law professors and other academics from universities across the country, including Harvard, Yale, Columbia, the University of California at Berkeley, the University of Michigan and many others. The open letter was published online Friday by the nonprofit advocacy group Protect Democracy. \u2018There is overwhelming evidence that President Trump betrayed his oath of office by seeking to use presidential power to pressure a foreign government to help him distort an American election, for his personal and political benefit, at the direct expense of national security interests as determined by Congress,\u2019 the group of professors wrote. \u2018His conduct is precisely the type of threat to our democracy that the Founders feared when they included the remedy of impeachment in the Constitution.\u2019 The letter comes two days after three legal experts testified to the House judiciary committee that Trump\u2019s actions met the constitutional standard for impeachment, although a law professor called by the panel\u2019s Republicans disagreed with them on that point. Congressman George Holding, a Republican on North Carolina, announced he would not seek reeelection next year, citing the state\u2019s newly redrawn congressional map as one reason for his departure. \u201cIt has also been gratifying to work for the ideals and values that I, like many other Americans, believe in,\u201d Holding said in a statement. \u201cAnd so it is with regret that I announce I will not be a candidate for Congress this election.\u201d North Carolina\u2019s new congressional map, which was approved this week by a three-judge panel after the previous map was thrown out for violating the state constitution, has made Holding\u2019s distruct a likely pick-up opportunity for Democrats next year. Holding becomes the 22nd House Republican to announce his departure amid a wave of retirements and campaigns for higher office. Fellow congressman Tom Graves, a Republican of Georgia, just announced his own retirement yesterday. Cory Booker said he was \u201ctaken aback\u201d by fellow Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg\u2019s comment that the New Jersey senator was \u201cwell spoken,\u201d which was wildly criticized for promoting a racist trope. \u201cMike and I have known each other for a long time,\u201d Booker told the podcast \u201cSignal Boost,\u201d adding that he has a \u201cgreat deal of regard\u201d for the former New York mayor. But Booker added, \u201cIt\u2019s sort of stunning at times that we are still revisiting these sort of tired tropes.\u201d The senator expressed hope Bloomberg would revisit the comments, but he said it was \u201cproblematic\u201d that so many people still did not see what was wrong with such language. Booker also made a point to return to his concerns about the Democratic Party taking black voters for granted, particularly in the wake of Kamala Harris\u2019 withdrawal from the presidential race. \u201cWe can\u2019t win without the enthusastic support of black voters, and we saw that between 2016 and 2012,\u201d Booker said. In an interview with the New Yorker, Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House intelligence committee, said Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t give a shit about what\u2019s good for our country\u201d. The New Yorker\u2019s Susan B Glasser asked Schiff whether he \u201chated\u201d Trump after the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, shouted down a reporter who asked her the same question. \u201cNo,\u201d Schiff replied, \u201cbut I do hate what he is doing to the country.\u201d The California Democrat argued Trump\u2019s alleged actions toward Ukraine demonstrate an alarming tendency to prioritize his own interests over those of the nation. \u201cThe president doesn\u2019t give a shit about what\u2019s good for our country, what\u2019s good for Ukraine,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about what\u2019s in it for him personally and for his re-election campaign.\u201d Schiff also justified House Democrats\u2019 timeline for moving forward with articles of impeachment, despite some Republicans\u2019 demands that they wait until courts rule on whether administration officials must comply with congressional subpoenas. \u201cThe long and the short of it is, though, given that the president is today trying to get foreign interference in the next election to help him, we do not feel that when we already have overwhelming evidence, we should wait any longer,\u201d Schiff said. Michael Bloomberg\u2019s ill-advised use of the phrase \u201cwell spoken\u201d to describe fellow Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker reminded some commentators of another controversy from the 2008 election involving Joe Biden. Running against future president Barack Obama, Biden said he believed voters were gravitating toward the then-senator beacuse of his \u201caticulate\u201d and \u201cclean\u201d image. \u201cI mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy,\u201d Biden said in February 2007. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s a storybook, man.\u201d Biden later released a statement apologizing for the remark, and Obama, who went on to choose Biden as his running mate, said he didn\u2019t take the comment personally. But Obama also released a statement saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t take Sen. Biden\u2019s comments personally, but obviously they were historically inaccurate. African-American presidential candidates like Jesse Jackson, Shirley Chisholm, Carol Moseley Braun and Al Sharpton gave a voice to many important issues through their campaigns, and no one would call them inarticulate.\u201d Billionaire Michael Bloomberg is receiving criticism for describing fellow Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker as \u201cwell spoken\u201d in an interview with CBS News. Bloomberg was asked about Booker\u2019s complaint that there are \u201cmore billionaires than Black people who\u2019ve made the December debate stage\u201d following the withdrawal of Kamala Harris. \u201cCory Booker endorsed me a number of times, and I endorsed Cory Booker a number of times,\u201d Bloomberg told Gayle King. \u201cHe\u2019s very well spoken; he\u2019s got some very good ideas. It would be better the more diverse any group is, but the public is out there picking and choosing and narrowing down this field.\u201d Bloomberg argued those who are complaining about the lack of diversity among the Democratic frontrunners should have fielded their own candidate. \u201cLots of people can enter,\u201d the former New York mayor said. \u201cIf you wanted to enter and run for president of the United States, you could have done that. But don\u2019t complain to me that you\u2019re not in the race. It\u2019s up to you.\u201d But Bloomberg\u2019s comments about Booker specifically quickly kicked off a round of criticism that he had promoted a racist trope that belittled the New Jersey senator\u2019s intelligence. The White House said in a statement that Trump was monitoring the situation at the naval air station in Pensacola after a shooter opened fired on multiple people. \u201cThe President has been briefed on the shooting at Pensacola Naval Air Station/Forest Sherman Field and is monitoring the situation,\u201d the statement said. According to the AP, at least one person was killed in addition to the shooter. House speaker Nancy Pelosi and other congressional Democrats who traveled to Madrid for an international climate meeting are insisting that their presence proved the US is still committed to its pledges. \u201cNot only are we saying that we as Democrats in the Congress are still in--America is saying that we are still in,\u201d Pelosi said in a press conference this morning. The United Nations, Chile and Spain are pushing countries to commit to new 2020 plans and goals to be carbon neutral by 2050. Most of the Democrats running for president have set similar targets, although to achieve them they would have to usher politically contentious climate proposals through a possibly divided Congress. Under Donald Trump, the federal government has fallen behind on its previous climate commitments, and advocates, states and localities have sought to fill the gap. The November jobs report was out this morning, and it showed the US economy created 266,000 jobs last month -- far excceeding the 186,000 forecasted by economists. Wage growth in some sectors has also hit its highest level since the financial crisis. The end of the General Motors strike certainly helped boost job creation, but the numbers are solid overall, indicating the US economy is strengthening despite Trump\u2019s trade war with China. For more analysis on the jobs numbers, follow the Guardian\u2019s business live blog. Authorities said a shooter who opened fire on multiple people at the naval air station in Pensacola, Florida, is now dead. The AP reports: News outlets are reporting that 10 people have been taken to area hospitals. Pensacola Police spokesman Mike Wood has confirmed that law enforcement responded to the active shooter. Base spokesman Jason Bortz said both gates are closed and the base is on lockdown. NAS Pensacola employs more than 16,000 military and 7,400 civilian personnel, according to its website. One of the Navy\u2019s most historic and storied bases, it sprawls along the waterfront southwest of downtown Pensacola. The base dominates the economy of the surrounding area and includes the National Naval Aviation Museum, a popular regional tourist attraction. Good morning, live blog readers! After a historic day on Capitol Hill, Nancy Pelosi took questions from audience members last night at a CNN town hall, where the House speaker dubiously claimed the impeachment inquiry isn\u2019t political. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about politics at all. This is about patriotism,\u201d Pelosi said hours after announcing that Democratic leadership would move forward with drafting articles of impeachment. \u201cIt\u2019s not about partisanship. It\u2019s about honoring our oath of office.\u201d Pelosi is fond of saying that Democrats are pursuing impeachment because, as Thomas Paine once wrote, \u201cthe time has found us\u201d, but it\u2019s undeniable that Americans have strong and opposing beliefs on Donald Trump\u2019s potential removal from office. According to the FiveThirtyEight polling average, 47.8% of Americans support impeachment, while 44% oppose it. Those numbers could affect Democrats\u2019 ability to maintain control of the House next year \u2013 and their hopes of taking back the White House. Here\u2019s what else is going on today: Trump will hold a roundtable on administraiton accomplishments for small businesses at 2.15pm ET and then speak at a White House Christmas reception. Nancy Pelosi and the congressional delegation that travelled to Madrid for the UN climate conference will hold a press conference at 9am ET. House Democrats will hold a press event at 10.30am ET to tout their bill that would restore the full strength of the Voting Rights Act. The blog has more coming up, so stay tuned."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
