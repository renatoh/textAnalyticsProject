In a 3,000-word statement written with Daniel Levy, a former adviser to Israeli Labour prime ministers, Lord Hain will say on Tuesday: \u201cSomehow the party has managed to alienate the vast majority of Jewish members and the Jewish community while doing nothing to advance the debate on Israel/Palestine, let alone justice for Palestinians.\u201d In what is designed to be a major intervention to persuade the party to address the roots of the problem, they add: \u201cLabour\u2019s debilitating antisemitism crisis has so far focused upon process \u2013 are those charged with antisemitic behaviour being properly disciplined by the party\u2019s leadership or not? When actually the problem is political, and therefore requires a political not simply a procedural solution.\u201d They also insist that those sounding alarm at antisemitism in the party are not trying to crush a debate about Israel\u2019s behaviour or echo Israeli government propaganda. The irony, they claim, is that the effect of Labour\u2019s stance on antisemitism has been \u201cto empower apologists for totally unacceptable Israeli government attacks on Palestinians and the steady throttling of their rights \u2013 allowing those apologists to scale new heights in their dishonest attempts to label criticism of such Israeli policy as \u2018antisemitic\u2019. \u201cGiven how much actual antisemitism is around on the left, and how weak the official Labour response to it has been, those keen to label even legitimate criticism as antisemitic have been handed useful cover. \u201cA new way is needed to both respect the Jewish community including the wellbeing of the world\u2019s largest Jewish community (Israel), while at the same time supporting critical debate about both the abhorrent treatment of Palestinians by successive Israeli governments and future possible solutions for Israel/Palestine,\u201d they write. \u201cWe must eradicate the curse of antisemitism paralysing the Labour party whilst allowing space for genuine argument about all legitimate options.\u201d After nearly two years of allegations about antisemitism, the two men hope the statement might be adopted as a basis for debate by the parliamentary Labour party and then given as an educational tool to all Labour candidates. Hain, a Labour peer and advocate of the Palestinian cause, and Levy, a former Israeli negotiator in peace talks with the Palestinians under the prime ministers Ehud Barak and Yitzhak Rabin, hope they have the credentials to open a wider political debate about Israel and Palestine without being accused of undermining Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership. They argue that four things first have to be acknowledged: There has been a \u201creal and troubling rise in incidents of antisemitism in the Labour party\u201d. There is \u201ca specific form of poisonous leftwing antisemitism that highlights global conspiratorial capitalist cabals and class enemies\u201d. The critical debate needed on what is happening in Israel/Palestine is crucial to any party committed to internationalism, international law, and universal rights. The recent Labour debate \u201chas done absolutely nothing to advance justice for Palestinians or the attainment of the legitimate rights and freedoms of the Palestinian people\u201d. The pair argue it is legitimate to challenge Zionism, and question whether a two-state solution still remains the best route to peace, or is still the least worst option. They suggest Labour\u2019s policy debate may need to move beyond \u201ca rather stale re-rehearsal of support for the peace process, condemnation of terror and acts of violence and opposition to settlements, central though each of those can sometimes be. For the truth is that a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict tragically looks further away than ever. \u201cIsraeli impunity versus accountability, Palestinian Authority clampdowns on their own civil society, the appalling treatment of Gazans \u2013 sometimes by all parties \u2013 and structural discrimination inside Israel itself are all issues that can and should be addressed by UK policy but are often ignored by seeing everything through a \u2018peace process\u2019 lens which increasingly seems a ritualistic mantra rather than a genuine negotiating route.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
