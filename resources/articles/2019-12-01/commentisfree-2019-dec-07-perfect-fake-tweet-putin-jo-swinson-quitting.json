Look and learn, Putin", "bodyText": "You\u2019ve got to feel for Russia, haven\u2019t you? It goes to all that trouble to create sophisticated, deep-fake, under-the-radar misinformation campaigns targeted at the raw heart of both British and US governments, all those gloomy bunker rooms full of hacker nerds, all that money over all those years, and then exactly one (one) Twitter account comes out and says Jo Swinson is quitting before polling day, and everyone just believes and retweets that instead. I have to preface this by saying: Maximilian Gapes isn\u2019t real and the entire tweet is a lie. Still, thousands of retweets later, the parody account was shuttered. But not before tweeting, \u201cBREAKING: Senior sources at Conservative party HQ have leaked details of approaches made LAST WEEK by representatives of the Lib Dem leadership who contacted them to discuss a potential coalition in the event of a hung parliament\u201d, which then got shared by Labour\u2019s Tulip Siddiq and Alex Sobel, and the SNP\u2019s Angus B MacNeil. Sorry, Russian psy ops, but you\u2019re no match for a lie that sounds nice enough and the inevitability that parliamentary candidates will retweet it without looking. Fascinating, though, from the perspective of the shitposting connoisseur: everything about the Maximilian Gapes account was tonally perfect to make the lie go viral. The profile picture was the exact same shirt-no-tie wearing-a-suit thing that everyone who goes to Westminster bars by choice and calls themselves a \u201cwonk\u201d has as their display picture; there was the phrasing of the tweet, the breathless \u201cBREAKING\u201d that always pre-empts a naked attempt at retweets; and the in-the-know wink of \u201csenior Lib Dem sources\u201d. Everything about it was cultivated, thoughtful, artistic. Maximilian Gapes might not exist, but he sounds real enough, because if you\u2019ve had even half an eye on the election you know the type: one of those lads who only tweets \u201cOh bravo, Matt, done it again\u201d whenever the Telegraph cartoonist does anything at all; could be anywhere between the ages of 12 and 45, it is impossible to tell for sure from their face; somehow starts a Twitterstorm after saying wearing jogging bottoms is \u201cpuerile\u201d. Then there is the lie itself, which is just believable enough, just about hinting at the frailty of Swinson\u2019s public-facing self-belief. And there\u2019s the sheer, entirely plausible Lib Demness of quitting before polling day because people don\u2019t like you. In a confusing time of fake news hysteria, getting it wrong \u2013 deliberately or otherwise \u2013 is a dangerous game to play, and in the long run it\u2019s probably right that an account such as Gapes\u2019s got shut down. But as a shitposter, as a sort of eyes-open hyper-aware bizarro-world reflection of the current say-without-checking news cycle, he was a creator of masterpieces. Putin, sign him up. Putin, Putin, sign him up. Putting the \u2018defect\u2019 into \u2018defecting\u2019 To be fair to Sam Gyimah, he\u2019s had a big year of defecting from the Conservatives to the Liberal Democrats and getting reported to the police for \u201cinaccurate and dangerous\u201d accusations about his Labour rival\u2019s role in Grenfell, so it\u2019s to be expected that he won\u2019t keep up with everything and know every bit of news, because he\u2019s been too busy swapping out all his blue ties for yellow and Googling \u201chow survive prison?\u201d That said \u2026 he does know Melania Trump is, like, married to the world\u2019s biggest rightwing nationalist hero, yes? And that his new party (you\u2019re in the Lib Dems now, Sam. Check your Wikipedia) is \u2013 until election day early-morning negotiations get started, anyway \u2013 supposed to be opposed to things like Donald Trump? And so that maybe tweeting, \u201cMelania Trump sends coded message: VOTE LIBDEMS this December 12th\u201d alongside a picture of her in a yellow dress is perhaps, as we say, \u201cnot the one\u201d? And some might even say, perhaps, \u201ca guaranteed vote killer\u201d? Swings and roundabouts It is 13 seconds in, if you are interested. Thirteen seconds into this video is the exact moment when Johnny Mercer \u2013 former army officer, Plymouth Moor View Conservative candidate, former Ministry of Defence minister and the answer to the question \u201cwhat if Bear Grylls never got his insatiable taste for piss?\u201d \u2013 has his heart visibly broken. \u201cHey folks, so we\u2019re at Manadon roundabout where one of the signs is in Plymouth, and, yeah, I\u2019ve got something to show you,\u201d he says, before creaking the camera around to a canvas sign where someone\u2019s daubed \u201cTWAT\u201d in large red letters over Mercer\u2019s name. \u201cNow that\u2019s not very nice, is it?\u201d In a week when Mercer deleted a tweet that contained a joke about Diane Abbott\u2019s intelligence, which leaned on a trope that many people condemned as being, well, if not fully racist then at least misogynist (which Mercer denies was his intention), it\u2019s a bit rich to talk about being \u201cnice\u201d in politics. But now we know the rules \u2013 making fun of the most abused politician online: good. Calling Johnny Mercer a roundabout twat: not on. \u2022 Joel Golby is the author of Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
