This dramatic downgrading of ambition reflects the manager\u2019s new-found relegation fears and, in an attempt to avoid the drop, he will try to persuade the hierarchy to start signing players aged over 25. McClaren set his sights on finishing in the top eight when he took over in June and restated that aim after signing Georginio Wijnaldum four weeks later. But having begun without a victory from the first eight Premier League games, he has swiftly adjusted his sights. Although he is quietly encouraged by two impressive 45-minute periods in a home draw with Chelsea and at Manchester City \u2013 where his side collapsed in the second half, ultimately losing 6-1 \u2013 the 54-year-old has jettisoned his pre-season objective. Instead Newcastle\u2019s stark new reality dictates that he acknowledges a relegation struggle looms. \u201cIf somebody said: \u2018You\u2019ll have 40 points by mid-April\u2019, I\u2019d take it,\u201d said McClaren as he prepared for Sunday\u2019s vital home against Norwich. \u201cI think people would think I\u2019d gone absolutely crazy if I turned that down. The most important thing for us is to get to 40 points. Especially with the new television deal, that has to be the absolute priority. It\u2019s the same for 10 or 11 other clubs. It\u2019s always the same; at Middlesbrough we used to have massive parties when we got to 40 points.\u201d One of the reasons Newcastle are bottom of the league is a lack of leadership within a team who have been on a downward spiral for almost a year. McClaren\u2019s task is to reverse that trajectory but the former England coach has been hampered by the demand of Mike Ashley, Newcastle\u2019s owner, that only players with potentially high resale values are signed. McClaren feels it is no coincidence that Aston Villa, who have a similar strategy in place, are also struggling at the wrong end of the Premier League and will endeavour to ensure some much-needed experience is recruited in January. \u201cI\u2019m here to help this football club go forward and my opinions on that have been voiced from day one,\u201d said McClaren, who will be without his injured goalkeeper Tim Krul for the remainder of the campaign. \u201cEverybody knows. There\u2019s a lot going on behind the scenes, a lot of discussions and forward planning. I\u2019m sitting there and saying: \u2018You know what \u2013 we need to do this, and we need to do that.\u2019 The next window is very important for this club.\u201d Until McClaren can sign some experienced professionals to help the club\u2019s undeniably gifted batch of youngsters fulfil their potential, the manager must concentrate on erasing his squad\u2019s pronounced mental fragility. \u201cWe\u2019re getting little setbacks that are causing us to disintegrate,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re shattering the confidence and belief. We need to address that, but I really believe there\u2019s a win around the corner. We don\u2019t quite know where, but once it happens and we get the monkey off our backs and the shackles are released, this team will really move forward.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
