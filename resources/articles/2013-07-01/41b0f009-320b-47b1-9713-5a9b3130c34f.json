Whichever ratings are used, those published by Timeform or the Racing Post, six of the seven runners are grouped within 3lb of each other, with only Miblish expected to struggle. The presence of Declaration Of War adds a great deal to the race and makes it a clash of two Royal Ascot Group One winners, Al Kazeem being the other. While Declaration Of War is stepping up in trip by two furlongs from the Queen Anne, the double he seeks is more common, having been achieved twice since 2001, while Al Kazeem would be the first Prince of Wales winner to follow up here since Mtoto in 1988. Aidan O'Brien said his instinct after the Queen Anne was not to step Declaration Of War up in trip; absurdly the horse even has an entry in the five-furlong Nunthorpe. But he finished strongly at Ascot in the style of a horse who would have no problem with 10 furlongs and it is a mistake to trifle with Group One winners at Royal Ascot who quicken as he did after battling for room to run. Even so Al Kazeem (3.50) looks marginally the stronger proposition, giving the impression that we have yet to find out how good he is. Though it was only by a neck that he collared Mukhadram at Ascot, everything fell into place for that rival, yet Al Kazeem reeled him in fairly readily. Admittedly, there is no room for a tactical blunder, especially as this trip on good to firm is on the sharp side for Al Kazeem, but James Doyle, his jockey, has been impressive on that score. Many will be tempted by The Fugue, since she made up a lot of ground to be third in the Prince of Wales. She will surely lie handier this time but that does not guarantee a better outcome; horses can be flattered by running on from the back when the race is over and the balance of her form leaves her a bit to prove. Pastorius, the latest German runner here to be underestimated by the market, appeals as a more likely source of value. 2.05 Sandown There may have been a bit too much give in the ground for Tickled Pink's liking in her last two starts. This firmer surface gives her the chance to return to the level she showed when landing a Group Three at Newmarket's Craven meeting and she is well drawn to make her pace tell. 2.20 Haydock Louis The Pious is the tentative suggestion, given that he might have needed his first two outings and is weighted to figure in what is an open race. 2.40 Sandown It is only with terrible ill grace that I can accept odds of 7-2 in a good-quality 17-runner handicap, especially when the horse is drawn uncomfortably wide, but Wentworth really should win this. The Britannia worked out poorly for him but he was still beaten by less than two lengths at the finish and has more to offer. A stack of things could go wrong and this race is hardly a suitable vehicle for heroic punting but Richard Hughes will probably find a way to get him to the front in time. If your nerves will not stand it, Postscript appeals each-way. 2.55 Haydock The well-bred and progressive Albasharah was unlucky not to finish closer at Royal Ascot in Forgotten Voice's race and looks well worth chancing on this step up in grade. 3.15 Sandown Continuing the theme of unlucky horses in Royal Ascot handicaps, Nargys seemed on her way to landing the Sandringham until running out of puff about 100 yards from the line, having begun her move from the very back of the 26-runner field. This is a different test and perhaps she needs the furious pace of a huge field but she stands out on that form. 3.30 Haydock Owner Marwan Koukash has a trio of hopefuls and the value might lie with Haylaman at around 16-1. He did not get into the race last time but ran as if today's 12-furlong trip will be no problem and had impressed in victory at Pontefract prior to that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
