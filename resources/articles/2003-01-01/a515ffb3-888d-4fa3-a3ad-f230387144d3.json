Robbie Fowler's transfer to Manchester City has collapsed after the Leeds striker turned down the move late this afternoon. Fowler had agreed personal terms at Maine Road after Leeds agreed a \u00a37m fee with City, but at the last moment changed his mind. His agent George Scott told Sky Sports News: \"Everything was agreed financially. He passed his medical. During his medical he had time to reflect on the deal and realised it was not the deal for him, although he was flattered by Kelvin Koogan's interest\". The 27-year-old England international, who was given a rousing reception by City's fans when he appeared as a late substitute in Leeds' 2-1 defeat at Maine Road at the weekend had agreed terms on Tuesday. But today he revealed: \"I had the opportunity to think things over and I want to stay at Leeds United. I am happy to do so now and I want to do my best for the club.\" * * * * * * * * * * * SERGEI TO BE A COTTAGER TONIGHT? If you ever need a case study in desperation, try watching the Fiver at 2am on a Saturday night. As yet another beautiful girl slips agonisingly through our fingertips despite our finely honed chat-up line - 'get your coat love, you've pulled' - you'll see our standards nose-dive by the second. Four, perhaps five failures later - and with the first bars of Careless Whisper striking up at the end of the evening - we're less fussy than Jean Tigana scavenging for a new striker. Or, come to think of it, Sergei Rebrov looking for a new club. Sometimes, however, we tumble into a slobbering wreck that's as needy as we are. And we're not the only ones who occasionally get lucky. For this afternoon, desperate-for-a-game striker Sergei agreed personal terms with desperate-for-a-forward Jean and seems likely to become a Cottager by the end of today. According to the football grapevine, the 28-year-old Ukranian, who cost Spurs about a million an inch when he signed from Dynamo Kiev in 2000, will cost the Cottagers just \u00a31m, with the fee potentially rising to \u00a33m if Fulham don't tumble into the First Division. At the moment things look on track - when asked whether he expected the move to be completed tonight, Rebrov's agent Sandor Varga offered a here-comes-the-bride: \"Yes, I do\". Sadly, when it comes to Sergei, the Fiver's learned not to take anything for granted. After all, when he joined Spurs he gushed: \"They managed to find a common language with me,\" before adding, perhaps in Esperanto: \"I am looking forward to playing in England. I like it better than Italian football, although I can't explain why.\" Back then, the Fiver wondered about his judgement in joining Spurs. Let's hope the little Ukranian hasn't blundered again. * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I will go to England to present myself, have a game and then come back to marry, and I will then start my new life\" - Brazilian World Cup winner Kleberson looks forward to joining Leeds United and marrying his 15-year-old girlfriend. Hmm, is that legal in Brazil? * * * * * * * * * * * HASSLING CHELSEA LIKE JIMMY FLOYD A small corner of the luxury complex at Chelsea's of Chelsea was uncharacteristically busy this afternoon. As the Fiver peered through the frosted glass, denied entry to the six-star Vacancies hotel by a jobsworth doorman, there appeared fewer empty seats than normal. As Kuddly Ken The Chairman tinkled the ivories (with what sounded like a brave reworking of Craig David's Seven Days), Vacancies positively buzzed. Which made a nice change. Look! Over there, beside that gaggle of blokes betting on the occupancy rate of Vacancies! It's a Premier League delegation discussing Charlton's complaint about Chelsea's sandpit pitch. The Fiver could just about make out the words \"in breach of League rule 17 section one\", and \"we'll reconvene tomorrow\" before a high-pitched wail drowned them out. \"I deserve better than that!\" blubbed England outcast Graeme Le Saux, re-reading his piece in today's Daily Express. \"I should have had a chance last year at the World Cup, I was playing as well as ever.\" One man missing, however, was Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink. Tired but happy after training this morning, Jimbo hot-footed it back to Heathrow's Terminal 4, a copy of the Sun under his arm and an uncharacteristic grin splashed across his face. \"Barcelona will table a final \u00a37m offer for Jimmy,\" he read, aloud, drooling at the prospect. \"Barcelona are set to offer a one-year deal with a contract extension if he scores 20 goals or helps win a trophy,\" he chuckled, before the PA filled the air with the sound of Catalan radio. \"Whether Jimmy goes or stays,\" boomed a voice sounding very much like Claudio Ranieri, \"depends on how much money Barcelona put on the table,\" So, it's all about the money. But with footballers, isn't that always the case? ** * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL That not-so-cunning box fox Francis Jeffers is available at a cut-price fee from Arsenal. Middlesbrough look likeliest to bite. Arsene Wenger will use the money to buy French under-21 shot-stopper Nicolas Penneteau for \u00a32.5m. Having brought lil' larrikin Lee Bowyer home, West Ham have decided not to sign South Korea's World Cup midfielder Kim Nam-Il after a 10-day trial. * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Real Betis midfielder Joey Gudjonsson, Iceland's most expensive export when he joined the Primera Division club for \u00a35m in 2001, has had initial talks with Aston Villa about a possible move before the transfer window closes on February 1. A loan deal seems Villa's most likely option. Fulham could face a transfer embargo if they fail to meet Monday's deadline for the final \u00a32.5m instalment of the \u00a311.5m fee agreed with Lyon for Steve Marlet. Administrators for York City have revealed that a second party could make an offer to buy the club despite missing the noon deadline. One unnamed bidder has already submitted an offer to buy the Third Division club, who have been in administration since December 18. Paolo Di Canio and Freddie Kanoute should both be back in action by the end of January. Di Canio has been making good progress at a rehabilitation centre in Bologna and Kanoute has responded to specialised treatment in America. * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO Channel 5: Jonathan Pearce's Football Night (12.15am) Today's mid-life crisis involves booze, the police and a celebrity. What more could you ask for? Dutch Football (12.55am) \"I've had some police related incidents in my time,\" brags Jonathan Holford. \"Such as the one where I was caught dancing with a small tree down Euston Road. And I may well be due a mid-life crisis seeing as I'm turning 30 in a couple of weeks and my cheek's have gone completely numb. Argentinian Football (2.25am) \"But I also have an Alex Higgins related incident. Sky Sports 1: FA Cup Football (6.30pm) \"I used to work as a tour guide for a London tour bus operator. The route started and finished near the Bag O' Nails Pub in Victoria and we would often nip in for a quick pint or two after - and some of us during - a day's work. Football League Review (8pm and 11pm) \"One time, we sat there and who should stagger in but Alex Higgins. Given he was famed for holding his booze I was not too surprised to see him suitably plastered. You're on Sky Sports (10pm and 2.30am) \"As a crowd gathered, the whispers of 'Look! It's that snooker bloke off the telly!' grew to the point where I am sure even he heard them through his drunken haze. Spanish Football League Review (1am) \"It didn't seem to bother him though, and after a while he tried in no uncertain terms to persuade a woman at the bar to dance with him. Refusal ensued and voices became raised. Sky Sports 3: Spanish Football League Review (9.30pm) \"Eventually the police were called. Weh-hey! It's turned out to be a police story as well after all. Radio Five Live: Sport on Five (7pm) \"Strangely enough, in common with yesterday's story, the barman then tried to sell his tale to the Sun and the Mirror. Although to be fair, so did most of the punters. TalkSport: Football First, Second &amp; Third (7pm) \"I'm not sure what happened to poor Alex after the police escorted him from the premises. He seemed very upset but strangely resigned. I do hope he's happier now. Maybe when I turn 30 I'll understand.\" Newstalk 106: Off the Ball with Ger Gilroy (7pm) There's clearly a theme emerging here; one involving booze, the boys in blue and poor old Hurricane Higgins.
