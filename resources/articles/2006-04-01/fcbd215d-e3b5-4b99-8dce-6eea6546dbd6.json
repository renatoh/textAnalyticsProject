There are so many different styles: what do you recommend? First off, unless you do a lot of food prep, you probably won't need more than three knives: a cook's knife, a paring knife and a vegetable knife. Sets, in other words, can be a waste of money, with only a couple of blades used on a regular basis while the rest sit unloved in a trendy knifeblock you'll soon be sick of the sight of. Before buying a knife, always check that it's comfortable to use: this is not something to buy sight unseen. It is impossible to state categorically which brand is best - ask 100 chefs to pick a marque and you'll most likely end up with an even split between Global from Japan and the German trio of Henckels, Ern and W\u00fcsthof; Victorinox and Sanelli might get a few votes, too, not least because they are comparatively cheap, while the odd flash Harry will insist that only state-of-the-art Japanese ceramic blades will do. Any department store worth its salt should offer most of these: try John Lewis (08456 049049, johnlewis.com), kitchenware specialist Divertimenti (0870 1295026, divertimenti.co.uk), or a professional supplier such as Nisbets (0845 140 5555, nisbets.co.uk) or Hansens (020-7351 6933, hansens.co.uk). This is one area where you get what you pay for - good knives are expensive: a 20cm cook's knife, say, will set you back around \u00a360. The other essential is something to sharpen them on - a blunt knife is not only harder to cut with, it's more likely to lose you a finger. If you don't fancy a steel (all the top brands do them, from \u00a325), the Chantry Knife Sharpener is a reliable, easy-to-use alternative (around \u00a325, widely available). Wanted: art deco furniture We have some walnut art deco, straight-edged bookcases. Where can we obtain a table or stand (modern or antique) to put our stereo system on, that would look OK with them? Tomlinsons are among Europe's largest antique dealers and will search out just what you're looking for if you give them a call. They have more than 5,000 antiques at any one time in their vast warehouse, take delivery of 2,500 new pieces each month and usually have around 30 art deco pieces in stock. Sarah Worrall, sales director, says an art deco cabinet such as the one you're describing would go for around \u00a31,000 fully restored, and about \u00a3500 unrestored. 'We'll happily try to find a specific piece if people get in touch,' she says. 'Or we can send email alerts with pictures of suitable new stock as it comes in.' Tomlinsons are in Moorside, Tockwith - five minutes off the A1 between York and Wetherby - and can be contacted on 01423 358833 (antique-furniture.co.uk). How do I store my partner's size-11s? We are searching for an appropriate unit for storing shoes and have a space between our wardrobe and the wall which would be ideal for a set of narrow shelves. My partner has size 11 feet. Can you help? Your best bet is to get something made. You could go the whole hog and commission a carpenter (contact the Institute of Carpenters, 0115 949 0641, carpenters-institute.org, for someone near you), but if you're in a hurry, check out Shelf Store (020-7794 0313, shelvingsystem.co.uk). The company's system of uprights and shelves is designed to be as flexible as possible; you simply select the height, width and depth, then position the shelves to suit your storage needs. As a guide, inner uprights start at \u00a37.66 plus VAT, outer uprights at \u00a311.91 plus VAT and shelves at \u00a35.96 plus VAT. For off-the-shelf versions, try Argos's Scandinavian shoe rack (code 0170019, \u00a379.99; 0870 600 8784, argos.co.uk), which is a simple wooden unit that has space for 10 pairs of shoes and a mirror on the front (H: 162.5cm, W: 44cm, D: 29.2cm). Alternatively, the Cotswold Company offers a 10-pair shoe ladder (H: 199cm, W: 36cm, D: 33cm) for \u00a389 (0870 241 0973, cotswoldco.com). Where to find knobs fit for a boudoir I am decorating my bedroom in a French boudoir theme and have hunted high and low for Perspex/ glass knobs for my white wardrobes, preferably smoky grey or turquoise blue and jewel-shaped. Any ideas? Monsoon Home (0870 412 9000) is a good source of quirky door handles but its stock changes rapidly, so what you'll find very much depends on when you search. It currently has a fluted crystal-effect clear knob for \u00a36, but watch its website (monsoon.co.uk) for new, high-fashion additions. Ditto Bombay Duck, which has faceted clear glass cupboard knobs in lots of sizes for \u00a36 (020-8749 3000, bombayduck.co.uk). A couple of websites stock glass and acrylic cupboard handles in boudoir-ish styles, but we drew a blank on finding any in smoky grey or turquoise blue. The ubiquitous colour is, you guessed it, 'clear' but there are some interesting shapes - not least the pumpkin, which is round with elegant ridges. Try doorfurnituredirect.co.uk (0151-652 3136) for a 35mm diameter crystal pumpkin cupboard knob for \u00a36.71, or take a look at e-handles.co.uk (01621 819100). You respond Re soundproofing a flat (Space Solves, April 1), may I offer another solution, tried in a flat I rented 15 years ago? The landlord arranged for a builder to do the following, and I was never disturbed again. A wooden grid was screwed to my side of the party wall. The screws were wrapped in wadding so the noise would not travel. This grid was then built out like an open box frame to a depth of four inches. This box frame was filled with wadding and compacted. Plaster boards were used to cover the frame and duly plastered and painted. The work took two days and cost, at that time, about \u00a3300. After this, I did not hear any more sound - unless I went out into the hallway where I was made very aware of the noise level next door and how successful the soundproofing had been.
