The seriously romantic couple are Michael Ealy and Joy Byrant as Danny and Debbie. Kevin Hart and Regina Hall are the funny couple, Bernie and Joan, doing the goofier stuff and having the wilder sex. It's basically a vehicle for Hart, who does get some laughs, especially when he is adoringly supportive of Joan's cooking \u2013 but when she is away from the table, urges his guests to spit the food out into resealable bags that he is secretly providing. The rest of the time it is by-the-numbers comedy, a date movie that could have been written by entertainment software, and quite divorced from real human beings and their experiences of sex. Paula Patton plays Danny's creepy ex Alison: she looks entirely robotic."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
