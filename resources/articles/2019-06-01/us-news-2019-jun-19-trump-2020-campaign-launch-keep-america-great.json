More than 500 days before the 2020 US election, the president formally launched his campaign before a capacity 20,000 crowd in a sports stadium in Orlando in the vital swing state of Florida, demonstrating that his base, at least, remains as fervent as ever. In a sign of that fervour, Trump\u2019s campaign raised a staggering $24.8m in the less-than 24 hours after kicking off his re-election bid, according to Republican party chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, an amount that dwarfs what the top Democratic 2020 contenders raised over the course of the first three months of this year. The president spent little effort offering a vision of the future on Tuesday evening. He and his supporters were most energised by his greatest hits: grievance politics, demonising opponents, raging against perceived injustices. There was even a reprise of attacks on Hillary Clinton, his defeated rival in 2016, complete with furious chants of \u201cLock her up!\u201d His vicious, often fabricated, attacks implied that while a referendum on his record would likely end in defeat, his campaign believes that whipping up fear of a Democrat in the White House could yet save his skin. \u201cJust imagine what this angry leftwing mob would do if they were in charge of this country,\u201d Trump said. \u201cImagine if we had a Democrat president and Democrat Congress in 2020. They would shut down your free speech, use the power of the law to punish their opponents, which they are trying to do now anyway.\u201d He added, without evidence: \u201cThey would strip Americans of their constitutional rights while flooding the country with illegal immigrants in the hopes it will expand their political base.\u201d Trump made the comments after saying 145 judges had been appointed under his administration, and recalling the bitterly disputed confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the supreme court. Kavanaugh had been credibly accused of sexual assault when he was a teenager. On Tuesday, Trump falsely claimed these were \u201cfraudulent charges\u201d. Watched by his wife, Melania Trump, and other family members, during a speech lasting more than an hour, the president set out a blueprint for attacks for whoever emerges from the crowded field of potential Democratic primary contenders, who will meet next week for their first debates. \u201cA vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American dream,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe Democrat party has become more radical, more dangerous and more unhinged than at any point in the history of our country.\u201d He falsely and wildly claimed that leading Democrats favour \u201copen borders\u201d and again repeated the falsehood that \u201cleading Democrats have even opposed measures to prevent the execution of children after birth\u201d. The most divisive president for decades argued it was Democrats who want to divide Americans into factions and \u201cshred the constitution\u201d. Democratic front-runner Joe Biden, who appeared at a fundraiser in New York as the president spoke, said Trump\u2019s politics are \u201call about dividing us\u201d in ways that are \u201cdangerous truly, truly dangerous\u201d. Trump, wearing his signature red tie and relishing the febrile atmosphere, also worked his familiar theme of us v them, putting himself on the side of the ordinary citizens and \u201cdeplorables\u201d, an unlikely position for a millionaire businessman, TV celebrity and now, president. \u201cMany times I said we would drain the swamp. That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing. That\u2019s why the swamp is fighting back so viciously and violently.\u201d He showed how he intends to weaponise the special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian election interference. \u201cWhat did they come up with?\u201d he asked. \u201cNo collusion and the facts that led our great attorney general to determine no obstruction.\u201d Mueller\u2019s findings did not establish a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Moscow, but it did point to 10 instances of attempted obstruction of justice, and Mueller himself has said he did not clear Trump of a crime. \u201cFor the last two and half years we have been under siege,\u201d he said, complaining that opponents have been given a \u201cfree pass\u201d. He warned: \u201cThey are really going after you. That\u2019s what this is all about.\u201d Just as in 2016, Trump showed his intention to go after the media. \u201cBy the way, that is a lot of fake news back there,\u201d he said. \u201cThe amount of press we have tonight reminds me of the Academy awards before they went political and their ratings went down the tubes.\u201d On several occasions the predominantly white crowd booed and jeered, made thumbs down gestures and chanted \u201cCNN sucks!\u201d It was four years to the week, Trump noted, since he descended the escalator at Trump Tower to launch his wildly improbable bid for the White House. On that occasion he railed against Mexican \u201ccriminals\u201d and \u201crapists\u201d and demanded a border wall. Getting the sequel under way, there was a familiar refrain. Trump condemned \u201cillegal mass migration\u201d to fire up the crowd. Trump admitted he has made his wall \u201ccheaper\u201d and asserted: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year. It\u2019s moving very rapidly.\u201d According to factcheckers, this is very unlikely, and most of the wall would be mere replacement barrier, not fresh construction. Indeed, there was the usual litany of Trump exaggerations and lies. The man who pulled America out of the Paris climate accord and slashed environmental regulations announced: \u201cOur air and water are the cleanest they\u2019ve ever been by far.\u201d He said of the economy: \u201cIt\u2019s soaring to incredible new heights. Perhaps the greatest economy we\u2019ve had in the history of our country.\u201d In fact, growth hit higher levels in the 1980s and 1990s. Trump also falsely claimed the biggest tax cut in American history. When he did look forward, the promises were vague and invited mockery. He suggested that a cure for cancer is within reach and declared: \u201cWe will eradicate Aids in America once and for all. We\u2019re very close.\u201d The bare-knuckle approach to the coming election was shared by the vice-president, Mike Pence, and Trump\u2019s children. Donald Trump Jr, whose gestures and pronunciations increasingly resemble his father, described Joe Biden, currently leading the Democratic field of contenders in the polls, as usually \u201cgroping someone\u201d \u2013 a reference to Biden\u2019s inappropriate touching of women. The negativity was also reflected outside the venue, where street vendors sold T-shirts that said: \u201cTrump 2020, Get on board or get run over\u201d, \u201cTrump 2020, the sequel, make liberals cry again\u201d and \u201cTrump 2020: Fuck your feelings\u201d. A handwritten banner hung on a wire fence proclaimed: \u201cHillary for prison\u201d. Members of the rightwing organisation Proud Boys yelled anti-Democratic chants, some displaying white power symbols on their clothing and banners. They were stopped by police before they could disrupt an anti-Trump rally. But there was also opposition. Hundreds of anti-Trump protesters applauded and took photos when a 20ft blimp of a Trump baby in a nappy was inflated near the arena. Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders gave an immediate rebuttal to Trump\u2019s speech, summarizing it as \u201clies, distortions, and total absolute nonsense\u201d. He criticized Trump for barely talking about the climate emergency, or that \u201chalf of the people in this country are working paycheck to paycheck\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
