Godolphin, once considered a serious rival to John Magnier's breeding empire, merely confirmed the depths of its decline, and while the scoreline was merely one-nil, as Mastercraftsman took the St James's Palace Stakes for Aidan O'Brien, the gulf in class was embarrassing. Mastercraftsman's win was the result of a typically well-executed plan hatched by the Ballydoyle stable, as first one and then another pacemaker carried him into the straight before Johnny Murtagh kicked for home over two furlongs out. Only Delegator had the pace to chase him, and the 2,000 Guineas runner-up was briefly ahead inside the final furlong. Mastercraftsman, though, refused to concede, and fought back to win by a neck. \"I knew it was going to be a battle,\" Murtagh said afterwards, \"but I was getting well on top in the final 10 strides. He's brave and courageous, and like all the great horses I ride for Ballydoyle, they never know when they are beaten.\" Mastercraftsman won the Irish 2,000 Guineas on heavy ground at The Curragh, but the backers were confident that he would reproduce the form on good-to-firm yesterday and sent him off at 5-6. \"He's got speed and stamina,\" O'Brien said, \"and soft ground and fast ground all come alike to him. If everyone decides to step him up to a mile and a quarter, I don't think he'll have a problem.\" The contrast with Godolphin's big moment of the week less than two hours earlier could not have been more complete. Gladiatorus, officially rated the best turf horse in the world after running away with a Grade One in Dubai in March, was favourite for the Queen Anne Stakes with the Dubai-born jockey Ahmed Ajtebi in the saddle, while Alexandros, the mount of Frankie Dettori, was also quietly fancied to run a big race. Gladiatorus set a strong pace to halfway but then folded like a deckchair to finish sixth, beaten nearly 20 lengths by Paco Boy, the 100\u201330 winner. Alexandros, meanwhile, was eased right down two furlongs out, and beat only one horse home. Saeed bin Suroor, the trainer of Gladiatorus, could offer no explanation for his run, and while Ajtebi showed clear signs of inexperience, looking around to check on his lead with half a mile to run, Lester Piggott in his prime would not have finished within 15 lengths of the winner. \"He was not half the horse he was in Dubai,\" Ajtebi said. \"He seemed like a different horse.\" Paco Boy, who travelled like the winner throughout, stayed on well inside the final furlong to confirm his stamina at a mile. \"I think that's put a few old jokers [about his stamina] to bed,\" Richard Hannon, his trainer, said. \"We were going to whip back to the July Cup [over six furlongs] if things didn't happen here, but we will have to have a rethink now.\" Hannon and Richard Hughes, Paco Boy's jockey, completed a double in the Coventry Stakes as Canford Cliffs routed his field by six lengths. He is now a general 8\u20131 chance for next year's 2,000 Guineas. \"We may look at the July Stakes,\" Hannon said, \"but this horse wants looking after. He could be next year's horse.\" This was also a day when the world came to Ascot and walked away with a third of the prizes. Scenic Blast, a muscle-bound monster, became the latest Australian sprinter to take the King's Stand, while Wesley Ward's Strike The Tiger broke entirely new ground in the Windsor Castle Stakes, becoming the first American-trained winner at the meeting. Scenic Blast could be called the winner from two furlongs out, as he cruised along in second gear while the rest of the field was flat out. Strike The Tiger, meanwhile, whose only previous start had been a victory in a claimer at Churchill Downs, was in front a furlong out and then held on well under a stylish ride by John Velazquez. \"I've never had a horse with the explosion this one has,\" Steve Arnold, Scenic Blast's jockey, said. \"I wasn't surprised that he picked them up so easily, and I was in front a long way out.\" Scenic Blast will miss the Golden Jubilee Stakes on the final day of the meeting, and run next in the July Cup at Newmarket. Strike The Tiger's win was a complete shock for the punters, who allowed him to start at 33\u20131, but he had not travelled from Ward's base in California just to give his owners a day out. \"This just proves that if you get a horse right on the day, it doesn't matter if they are running in Australia or China or anywhere, as the Australian horse showed earlier today,\" Ward, who has several more runners at the meeting this week, said. Hughes completed a treble when Judgethemoment took the Ascot Stakes, but Murtagh's day was soured by a series of suspensions. He was banned for a day for his use of the whip on Mastercraftsman, for five days for causing serious interference on Kayf Aramis in the Ascot Stakes and then another day for failing to ride out to the finish on the same horse. He will miss the Group One Eclipse Stakes at Sandown on 4 July as a result."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
