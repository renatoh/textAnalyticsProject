The fearless felines hidden by their author", "bodyText": "What was the first novel in the English language? This seemingly benign question is the source of centuries of literary squabbles. Some claim the title for Thomas Malory\u2019s Le Morte d\u2019Arthur; others insist it is Robinson Crusoe, but there are also camps for Moll Flanders and Pamela. Now there is one more to add to the mix: a little-known contender about a coterie of talking cats and an alchemist that dates back to the 16th century. As cute as it sounds today, this book was so potentially inflammatory at the time, with its themes of sexual violence and religious satire tucked beneath its fuzzy feline plot, that its author, William Baldwin, hid the manuscript away at the height of the Reformation. Its title alone, Beware the Cat \u2013 thought to be a shortening of \u201cBeware the Catholic\u201d \u2013 might have got him killed. He finally published it in 1561, but the book fell out of fashion and lay forgotten for centuries. In the 1990s, academics began to read it with fresh eyes and found all the signs of an early novel \u2013 a central linear narrative, character and motivation, as well as a beginning, middle and end. Now, a group of English Literature scholars are adapting Baldwin\u2019s story into a theatrical experience to spread the word and convince the wider world of its novelistic properties. Rachel Stenner, a lecturer in the English department at Sussex University, says the aim is \u201cfor as many people as possible to know about Baldwin. He is an important figure that many have never heard of.\u201d Stenner conceived the project with Frances Babbage, professor of theatre at Sheffield University, as well as Terry O\u2019Connor, an honorary professor at Sheffield University and one part of the experimental theatre ensemble Forced Entertainment. Penny McCarthy, a reader in fine art at Sheffield Hallam University, produced all the artwork for the adaptation, basing her cat drawings on her own pet cat. Together, they have performed the play at Sheffield and as part of the Brighton Fringe. Now they are taking it to the RSC\u2019s The Other Place in Stratford. They describe Baldwin as a formidable, if forgotten, figure of 16th-century literature. His influence may in fact have reached William Shakespeare, who might have named the witches\u2019 cat in Macbeth \u2013 Grimalkin \u2013 after one of Baldwin\u2019s cats who appears decades earlier. In Baldwin\u2019s story the cats are good, bad and dastardly, but mostly heroic and more morally upstanding than humans. Alongside them is a Catholic priest dabbling in alchemy. After drinking a potion, he learns to understands the cats caterwauling on his central London rooftop and a wacky plot follows, including a testimony from a ravished female cat who is seeking justice in a nocturnal cat court. For cat-lovers, a story about talking cats is nothing new. There have been innumerable fictive felines, from TS Eliot\u2019s slinky poems to JK Rowling\u2019s shapeshifting Minerva McGonagall, but also on Robinson Crusoe\u2019s island and in James Joyce\u2019s Ulysses when Mr Bloom buys liver from the butcher\u2019s to fry up and feed the cat. In Baldwin\u2019s book, the story is positioned at cat\u2019s eye level, a little like the perspective in a Tom and Jerry cartoon. Philosophically, Baldwin was asking the kind of questions with which 20th-century philosophers have since grappled, says Bob McKay, a senior lecturer in English Literature at Sheffield whose research has focused on animals living beside humans in literature. A seminal essay by Jacques Derrida, entitled \u201cThe Animal That Therefore I Am\u201d, is a perfect example. The point Derrida makes in it, he says, is that throughout the history of philosophy we have looked at animals and made pronouncements about them but the animals are looking back at us. Baldwin\u2019s text was asking some of the same questions as Derrida centuries ago, adds McKay: \u201cDo animals have reason? Is there an insurmountable boundary between you and the gaze of the cat or is there some way you can get across that divide? Can we bridge this gap between us and the animal Other?\u201d Cats are an alternative moral guardian in Baldwin\u2019s story as well, says O\u2019Connor, wiser and more moral than the humans. \u201cYou are reminded that your cat is watching you and has access to all your secrets.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d says McCarthy: \u201cI always suspect my cat knows more than I can tell.\u201d In the adaptation, chapters are read out from behind a table by various performers while an array of McCarthy\u2019s cat drawings appear on an overhead projector. There are also dramatic asides, not spoken, but written on boards, and held up to the audience. The team of academics wanted to push the boundaries of what can and should be classed as theatre. The production is informed by performance art, fine art, cinema and song, says O\u2019Connor. \u201cWe wanted the audience to love the performance for all its linguistic qualities. The idea was to create a listening space and reflect on what it meant to be read to in our times.\u201d Beware the Cat is at the Other Place, Stratford-upon-Avon, on 6 July and the Workshop Theatre in Leeds on 23 November."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
