The furrow of her brow gave away her concern and, whether it was stress or merely steely determination, her teammates looked similarly grave. In contrast when Megan Rapinoe, the leader and tone-setter of the US team, walked out moments later, she looked like she was taking a leisurely stroll in the park. Her body language was loose, and she looked around, seemingly taking in the sights and sounds of a packed and raucous Parc de Princes. She casually chatted with teammate Alex Morgan, who was similarly relaxed. The pressure right from the first whistle seemed to be entirely on France, the hosts who were starting to see their nation fall in love with the women\u2019s national team at long last. The French players had seemingly internalized the enormity of Friday\u2019s blockbuster quarter-final and were playing like they had everything to lose. \u201cYes, there was pressure but was a good pressure because we have a lot of support with us,\u201d Henry said after the game, which ended in a 2-1 defeat for her team. \u201cBut on the field, it was hard because they scored early. After that, to score against USA is difficult.\u201d Indeed, it was Rapinoe who scored in less than five minutes to put the US ahead, which practically sealed USA\u2019s win. After all, the US have never lost in a World Cup after scoring first. France have always lost after conceding first. Following her opening goal \u2013 which accidentally nutmegged Julie Ertz and Henry en route to the net \u2013 Rapinoe posed as if to say, \u201cTa-da! It\u2019s me!\u201d It was quintessential Rapinoe. She followed that up by pouncing on a deflected ball in the 65th minute for her second goal, without any French defenders tracking her run. Rapinoe joked that she almost had too much time to think about how to finish, but her strike was expertly placed. There was no second-guessing. Yet, it had been the sort of week that might drag other players down. Tweeter-in-chief Donald Trump criticized comments she made months ago about not wanting to visit the White House, making Rapinoe the latest target of the president\u2019s most fervent supporters. And the dust-up happened ahead of what had been hyped as the biggest quarter-final game in Women\u2019s World Cup history \u2014 \u201ca total shitshow circus,\u201d as Rapinoe had called it in the days leading up to the game. Not that the attention appeared to faze Rapinoe. She was unflappable this week taking questions from reporters about the Trump ordeal, and that cool carried over into the match. \u201cI don\u2019t really get energized by haters,\u201d Rapinoe explained after the game. \u201cI feel like there\u2019s so many more people that love me so I\u2019m like, \u2018This is great!\u2019 I\u2019m more energized by that.\u201d Indeed, her teammates and coach Jill Ellis have expressed nothing but support and admiration for Rapinoe. \u201cPinoe\u2019s such a special person because people just gravitate to her,\u201d midfielder Rose Lavelle said. \u201cShe\u2019s such a fun, unique person off the field and it helps on the field \u2013 she\u2019s someone people want to listen to and learn from. She\u2019s helped carry us through the tournament.\u201d With five goals, including a brace against both Spain and France, it\u2019s plausible to argue that Rapinoe has been carrying the US team. The Americans looked at ease in the quarter-final, and there was no better embodiment of that feeling than Rapinoe. The majority of USA\u2019s attacks were initiated down the left, Rapinoe\u2019s side of the field. Crystal Dunn and Samantha Mewis kept feeding Rapinoe the ball. That wasn\u2019t necessarily deliberate \u2013 Rapinoe was just in the zone. As defender Becky Sauerbrunn put it: \u201cWhen a player\u2019s on, you find that player more often that not.\u201d Rapinoe wasn\u2019t wearing the captain\u2019s arm band on Friday, but no player has influenced the US this year more than the 33-year-old, who plays the way she seems to approach life: with flair, irreverence, and supreme confidence. Morgan afterward called her \u201cthe heart of the team.\u201d France by comparison looked tense and stern coming into Friday\u2019s clash. Later, as the game drifted away from them, they looked flustered and desperate. In the 78th minute, Henry fired a slow, skipping shot that USA goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher did well to smother, and the French captain winced. What makes Henry so exceptional as a captain is her intensity and physicality. She can do it all \u2013 score from distance, spray passes around the field or break up play with crunching tackles. But she and her teammates could never quite throw a poised US team off their game. Even though France eventually pulled a goal back, it never felt as if France were about to stage a complete comeback. \u201cWe have had quarter-final defeats haunting us for a while,\u201d French coach Corrine Diacre said afterward. For the hosts, who now have failed to qualify for the 2020 Olympics because of the Friday\u2019s loss, the narrative continues. The pressure, the moment was too big for them. \u201cWe had never seen a full stadium,\u201d Henry admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s a path for the women\u2019s sport and we have to continue to work.\u201d For the US and Rapinoe though, it\u2019s on to the semi-final round, and they too are aware of the stage they are on. \u201cEveryone understands the gravity of the moment,\u201d Rapinoe said. On Tuesday, we will see which one of England and the US handle that gravity best."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
