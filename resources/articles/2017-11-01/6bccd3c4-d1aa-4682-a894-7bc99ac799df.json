With Alan Pardew poised to become the club\u2019s new manager, goals by Hal Robson-Kanu and Sam Field put West Bromwich Albion on course for their first win since August. But instead Megson\u2019s caretaker stint closed with a draw, as a two-goal lead was whittled away by a Newcastle United side also craving a change of form. Ciaran Clark cut the deficit by heading into the net in the 59th minute and then, seven minutes from time, Jonny Evans deflected a free-kick by Matt Ritchie into his own goal. Newcastle avoided a fifth straight defeat and Albion\u2019s quest for a victory goes on even if their search for a manager has ended. \u201cIt\u2019s a right kick in the whatsits,\u201d said Megson of the lost lead. In the first match here since Tony Pulis was put out of Albion\u2019s misery, Megson initially presented a good case for being kept on. He had said that Saturday\u2019s encouraging 1-1 draw at Tottenham Hotspur reawakened his passion for management eight years after he last performed a No1 role and in the first half here he endeared himself to the home crowd, who sang his praises as the players trooped off at the interval. Albion, more enterprising than under Pulis, took the lead on the stroke of half-time through Robson-Kanu, the only alteration that Megson had made to the lineup that started at Wembley. The Welshman headed powerfully into the net from close range after a dainty cross from the left by Kieran Gibbs, who, in turn, had run on to a raking crossfield ball by Evans. Coming just before the break the goal was well-timed and, what is more, it was deserved, as Albion were the brighter side after a drab start. Rafael Ben\u00edtez, eager to stimulate an upturn from his side, had made five changes to the lineup that lost 3-0 at home to Watford on Saturday, including in goal, where Karl Darlow was drafted in for his first league appearance of the campaign. Darlow was motionless in the 19th minute when a curling shot from 25 yards by Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n left him helpless. The goalkeeper was grateful to see it skim the top of the bar. Other than that, the main moments of quality in the first half came from Field, the elegant 19-year-old midfielder whom Megson again included instead of Grzegorz Krychowiak, the expensive loanee from Paris Saint-Germain. With Albion looking liberated, there was no sign of menace from the visitors until the 51st minute, when Ayoze P\u00e9rez caught a dropping ball with a sumptuous volley from 20 yards. Foster did not waste time getting down to save it. Five minutes later the home crowd jumped to their feet to cheer a volley that did find the net. The scorer could not have been more popular, Field finding acres of space beyond the back post to guide the ball calmly into the net after a cross by Phillips. \u201cHe\u2019s one of our own,\u201d crowed the home fans but they were struck dumb three minutes later when Newcastle halved their lead. Clark gave the visitors new hope by heading a cross by Ritchie into the net from close range. Newcastle then pushed Albion back and eventually gained their reward when Ritchie\u2019s wicked delivery from the right was diverted into the net. \u201cWith this bad run, to react the way we did at 2-0 down is very positive for the future,\u201d said Ben\u00edtez. \u201cWe can improve and we have to improve but you could see character, commitment and some good play.\u201d Megson will meet Albion\u2019s chairman, John Williams, at 10am on Wednesday to find out about his future at the club. He made it clear he would be interested to hear from other clubs, too. \u201cI\u2019ve had two promotions to the Premier League,\u201d said the 58-year-old. \u201cI kept Bolton up after they had only four points from 10 games. I took them further than they had ever gone in Europe. I\u2019ve never been one to blow my own trumpet but maybe I should start. I can sort football clubs out.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
