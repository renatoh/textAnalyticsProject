Cook was last week named as captain of a provisional 30-man squad for the tournament in Australia and New Zealand but has continued to cut a beleaguered figure at the helm of the one-day side. The 29-year-old has averaged less than 18 with the bat as the tourists slipped to a 4-2 series defeat in Sri Lanka with one game remaining. \u201cWe review everything at the end of every series, we\u2019ve always said that,\u201d Moores told Sky Sports when asked if Cook would be captain at the World Cup. \u201cWe make no bones that we\u2019re passionate to try and get our best side to go out and win a World Cup. Cook needs runs but he\u2019s also had some great times as an England player. He\u2019s in a tough patch at the moment but that\u2019s something he\u2019s working hard to get out of.\u201d Cook\u2019s performance in Pallekele during England\u2019s 90-run defeat in the sixth ODI typified the slump that has led to a growing number of critics questioning his captaincy and his place in the team. He dropped a routine catch off Kumar Sangakkara, on 41 at the time, and the left-hander went on to make a game-changing 112. Ian Botham added to his recent criticism of Cook. He told Sky Sports: \u201cWith Moores saying that we review everything at the end of a series, then I would say it is not as nailed down as it [Cook\u2019s captaincy] appeared two or three weeks ago. Maybe there is going to be a bit more thought. But at the moment there is just no way that you could play Alastair Cook in the World Cup. He\u2019s just all at sea.\u201d Cook scored a single before succumbing to the second ball he faced, again lbw to an off-spinner, but he still believes he is the man to lead the side for the tri-series against Australia and India in January and the World Cup. \u201cNot scoring the runs I\u2019d like is not a great place to be as a captain,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want to lead from the front and when it\u2019s not happening for you it\u2019s incredibly frustrating. I\u2019m a better player than I\u2019ve shown at the moment and I\u2019ve just got to keep going.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
