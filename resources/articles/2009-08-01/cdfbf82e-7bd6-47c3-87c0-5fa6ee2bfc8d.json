There were two contacts, bat on pad and ball on pad. Such moments of palpable error, however understandable, make the case for reviews irrefutable. I don't think reviews of one sort or another mean umpires' decisions would be undermined. Most umpires favour the review as they are helped by being put right from time to time and they are aware that the spirit of the game is improved by the highest possible number of correct decisions. My first inclination was to leave it to the umpires; to let on-field umpires consult with the TV umpire whenever he felt uncertain, rather like rugby referees asking whether there is any reason why they should not award a try. I've been persuaded since, however, that some insecure umpires will refer almost every decision, or some over-confident ones will fail to refer decisions that may possibly show they were wrong. There was also the small fear that bowlers who felt hard done by would suddenly find their shoelaces coming loose as they wait in hope for the referral. So I now support the idea of reviews. The main aim of umpiring is to get as many decisions right as possible. This is important from the point of view of truth and justice. Clearly wrong decisions leave a bad taste in the mouth. They also encourage dissent and ill-feeling between sides. One side or the other starts to feel aggrieved and will put pressure on the umpires. An important side effect of series where the review system has been applied has been the rarity of disciplinary action for dissent. I have long been of the opinion that Hawk-Eye should be used as part of the review system. Some have said that the predictive path of the ball is pure supposition, that what might have been exists only in a world of speculation. But experts on this matter must already have been relying on such evidence, imperfect though it is, as for some years statistics on percentages of correct decisions have routinely been published. What could the ICC and others rely on in coming to such conclusions if not ball-tracking evidence? Moreover, I have heard of a third umpire, who had given his lbw decision on the basis of television footage up to the point of contact of ball on pad, punch the air in self-vindication when he saw that his impression was backed up by the ball-tracking shown subsequently. In other words, he implicitly felt that this was good evidence. Decisions of lbw are speculations; the only question is, what offers the best possible evidence of what would have happened had the ball missed the pad \u2013 the umpire's unaided perceptions or those enhanced by computerised ball-tracking devices? I admire the way the ICC has moved in making use of TV evidence. They have proceeded with proper caution. For many years, line decisions alone were referable. No one now questions the value of the technology in these cases. Gradually the TV companies have improved their technology, so that now we are in the position where most people accept that cameras can improve decision-making when there are questions about where the ball pitched, where the point of contact was, and whether the ball touched bat or glove in potentially disputed catches and lbws. Now there is finally acceptance of the validity and value of predictive path technology. I gather that the ICC wishes to clarify various aspects of the overall situation. First, is to insist on the best possible viewing conditions for the third umpire. There is no point in consulting him if he is viewing things through a snowstorm or on a tiny set. Second, there may well be a case for specialist TV umpires. There may be some who are best employed in the privacy of a dark room, while others' strengths involve providing an atmosphere and setting that enhances the whole conduct of the game on the field. Third, there needs to be better communication between on-field umpires and their colleagues in the TV room. Fourth, the ICC proposes to make more explicit exactly what is required for a decision to be reversed. In general, the on-field umpire will be given the benefit of the doubt; there will also be an element of benefit of doubt being given to the batsman, as has traditionally been the case. If the umpire has given a batsman out lbw when the tracking pictures suggest that the ball would have clipped the leg or off stump, the decision will be upheld. If the appeal comes from the fielding side and the pictures suggest the ball would have clipped the stumps in just this way, the decision will not be overturned. For a decision to be changed in favour of the fielding side, the pictures will have to suggest that at least half the ball would have hit the stumps. I believe these will be called \"boxes of correctability\". Other factors that have to be considered are cost \u2013 it is agreed that there must be a minimum number of cameras, placed with precision. TV facilities in the third umpire's room must be the best quality. Another factor is the involvement of the broadcasters; they will be brought in to help with and be helpful to the requirements of accuracy and precision. Finally, there will be a question of how many unsuccessful reviews will be permitted in any innings. I am inclined to agree with ICC that the optimum is two \u2013 not too many to make for frivolous reviews towards the end of any innings and not too few to allow for the odd genuine mistake and for borderline cases. With the current state of technology, I would propose that neither reviews nor requests for technological help made by on-field umpires be allowed for catches near the ground. I gather it has been accepted that replays are often ambiguous because of picture distortion. Umpires should either take the fielder's word for it or make up their own minds about low catches. At Lord's, there were two such events, one when Nathan Hauritz seemed to catch Ravi Bopara at mid-on (it was referred to the third umpire, who advised he be given not out. Later, Phillip Hughes edged to Andrew Strauss at slip. His claim for a catch was upheld by the on-field umpires. In my opinion, neither case should have been referred."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
