The grassroots group said the vast majority of delegates attending next week\u2019s Labour conference in Liverpool support their proposals for mandatory reselection, where MPs have to stand in open contests in order to run again for a seat, according to its polling. After polling more than 1,100 delegates from 450 local Labour parties, Momentum said 72% were supportive of the proposals, with 17% opposed and 6% undecided. A Momentum petition backing the measure has gained more than 12,000 signatures in less than a week. But senior Labour politicians are understood to be cautious about the proposals, including Jeremy Corbyn loyalists in the shadow cabinet. Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said it was a \u201cdifficult topic\u201d and said the party should be \u201ccareful with proposals like this\u201d. \u201cWe want it to be a democratic party, where members feel like they have their say,\u201d she told BBC Radio 5 Live. \u201cBut the other side is if an MP had to go through a mandatory reselection process every three, four, five years, their attention would be drawn away from Westminster. \u201cIt needs to be looked at carefully. What I wouldn\u2019t like to see is members of the shadow cabinet doing great jobs in parliament, holding the government to account, [then] having to go through a reselection process, diverting their attention away. Equally, members should have a say, so I do take both views and it will be an interesting discussion if it does make it to the conference floor.\u201d Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said he backs the current system of a trigger ballot \u2013 where MPs must lose the backing of local branches and affiliates before any reselection process is triggered. \u201cI think that works quite effectively but that will be a debate \u2013 I can\u2019t see it going through, but you never know on these occasions,\u201d he said last week. Momentum argues that an \u201coutdated rulebook\u201d is holding back new members. The party\u2019s national co-ordinator, Laura Parker, cited the example of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the 28-year-old Democratic nominee for Congress, stating that if she \u201chad been subject to Labour\u2019s restrictive, outdated rules she would have been shut out\u201d. \u201cThere is an overwhelming desire at the grassroots for a radical democratisation of our party and we ignore that desire at our peril,\u201d Parker said. \u201cIf we can\u2019t make democracy work in Labour, we can\u2019t make it work in the rest of society, and we should start by getting our own house in order. \u201cMeasures to open up parliamentary selections, increase grassroots representation on the national executive committee and give members more of a say in leadership contests are supported by a vast majority of ordinary Labour members, and I hope NEC members will take note of this support when they meet on Tuesday.\u201d Labour\u2019s annual conference is likely to be dominated by debate on the party\u2019s Brexit policy, after an unprecedented number of constituency groups submitted motions calling for the party to back a new referendum. Of the 272 motions being examined by the party\u2019s conference arrangements committee on Monday, 151 are on the subject of Brexit. The majority call for the party to adopt a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d on the final deal, with template motions drafted by a number of grassroots groups, including the leftwing Another Europe is Possible, Labour for a People\u2019s Vote and the student group FFS (For our Future\u2019s Sake). The sheer number of motions submitted will mean the party is all but bound to accept Brexit for a topic of debate at conference. Labour chiefs are expected to thrash out a compromise position when delegates meet on the Sunday night of conference to agree a composite motion, which is unlikely to expressly endorse a new poll but may keep such an option on the table. Michael Chessum, national organiser for Another Europe is Possible, said: \u201cIf we don\u2019t have a manifesto commitment for a fresh referendum, we will end up going into an autumn election either promising a \u2018bespoke Labour Brexit\u2019, which we have no time to negotiate, or offering a Norway-style deal, which is straightforwardly worse than EU membership and will leave Corbyn with no seat at the European table.\u201d Mike Buckley, who founded Labour for a People\u2019s Vote, said it was astounding that almost a quarter of constituency parties had submitted motions calling for a new vote on the deal. \u201cThe Labour movement has shifted decisively against Brexit this summer \u2013 these motions follow the trade unions\u2019 decision to oppose Brexit and support the principle of a final say,\u201d he said. On Sunday, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said his party should support a vote on the final deal. \u201cI don\u2019t believe Theresa May has the mandate to gamble so flagrantly with the British economy and people\u2019s livelihoods,\u201d he wrote in the Observer. However, the shadow international trade secretary, Barry Gardiner, argued that a fresh referendum would give May a lifeline. \u201cCalling for a second referendum is really giving her a lifeline, because then she can say \u2018Oh, if I can\u2019t get it through parliament, I\u2019ll go back to the people,\u2019\u201d he said. Labour would make a judgment later on whether to back any new poll, he said. \u201cThe reason we have not ruled anything out is because nobody knows what\u2019s going to happen over the next few weeks.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
