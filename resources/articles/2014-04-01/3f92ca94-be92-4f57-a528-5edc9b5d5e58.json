Here's a summary of where things stand: \u2022 GM CEO Mary Barra apologized for deaths linked to an ignition switch the company knew was flawed but failed to replace or to inform consumers about for more than 10 years. \u2022 Under direct questioning about whether GM accepted responsibility for the fatalities, Barra dodged. \"I again want to reiterate, we think the situation is tragic, and we apologize,\" she said. \u2022 Barra repeatedly professed ignorance of the details of internal GM decision-making, saying she was waiting for the results of an internal investigation. \u2022 Barra said she did not know why GM had continued to use the switches after engineers determined they did not meet the company's specifications, and she said she did not know why GM had not assigned a new part number to a replacement switch it began using in 2006. \u2022 \"Do you believe there was a cover-up, or was it just sloppy work?,\" asked Rep. Marsha Blackburn. Barra said that's what former US attorney Anton Valukas would be investigating to find out. \u2022 Family members of crash victims sat in the hearing room, with pictures of the victims propped along the back wall. \"I am deeply sorry,\" Barra said. Guardian business correspondent Dominic Rushe (@dominicru) has filed a news story on Barra's testimony, which reads in part: But her failure to give any substantive answers failed to satisfy members of the committee, who dismissed her comments as \u201cgobbledegook\u201d and \"unacceptable\u201d. [...] Barra avoided questions about whether GM would take \u201cresponsibility\u201d for the deaths. GM emerged from bankruptcy in 2008 and is technically a new company, and therefore not liable for lawsuits related to deaths before that time. Barra announced that GM had appointed Kenneth Feinberg, a lawyer who specializes in a restitution payments in major disasters, including the terrorist attacks of 9/11 and the BP oil spill, to look at the case. Read the full piece here. Friedman paints a picture of how difficult it can be for regulators, who lack internal malfunction reports of the kind GM generated, to pinpoint a problem with a car based on accident data alone. Chairman Murphy asks Friedman why NHTSA was convinced that an investigation of Chevy Cobalt airbags was not warranted. Friedman says \"the core piece of information that they relied on... was an analysis of the injury crash complaints associated airbag non-deployment... when the team did that comparison, the Cobalt did not stand out. It was a little bit above average.\" Murphy says NHTSA raised a red flag twice about the Cobalt. Why wasn't any action taken? \"Folks were trying to understand why the airbags did not deploy\" Friedman says. \"... special crash investigations were inconclusive... because these crashes happened in offroad conditions, with unbelted occupants.\" Friedman is testifying. \"Our employees go to work every day trying to prevent tragedies just like these,\" he says. Barra is done testifying. Up next is David Friedman, acting adminisrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In an advance copy of his opening statement [pdf], Friedman blames GM for mishandling the ignition switch problem: GM first provided NHTSA a chronology of events on February 24, 2014. The information in GM\u2019s chronology raises serious questions as to the timeliness of GM\u2019s recall. [...] Had the information newly provided to NHTSA by GM been available before now, it would have better informed the agency\u2019s prior reviews of airbag non-deployment in GM vehicles and likely would have changed NHTSA\u2019s approach to this issue. Lee Terry, Republican of Nebraska, apologizes for being late, \"but my plane was delayed for mechanical issues, probably an ignition switch.\" No audible laughter in the hearing room in response to the joke. Terry: What is the difference between non-compliance [with NHTSA] versus a defect? Barra: That's a very broad question. Terry: No, it's a very specific question. Barra: ... The hearing has taken a detour, temporary it is hoped, of Congress members reminiscing about cars they have owned and the operations of their ignitions. Barra's repeated professions of ignorance about just how GM works might be more plausible if she were not a second-generation, 33-year-veteran of the company. Her expressions of interest in what the company's internal investigation will discover come off as a bit too ingenuous, as if she'd commissioned a lunar mission. \"I want to know that as much as you,\" she has told the committee. GM stock is not doing much. Barra is a little too wishy-washy for Rep. Jan Schakowsky's tastes in reply to Schakowsky's question, \"Does GM accept responsiblity?\" The point of the question is that the current GM, after its declaration of bankruptcy, it technically a new business entity which is not clearly liable for fatal mistakes under the old company. Barra's answer shows she understands the importance of not outright accepting \"responsibility\": \"I again want to reiterate, we think the situation is tragic, and we apologize,\" Barra says. Schakowsky presses. Do you accept responsibility, and even liability? she asks. \"Do you take responsibility? Is the company responsible? The new GM, is it responsible?\" Barra says the company recognizes a moral responsibility and would act right by its customers. Which would be a change. Vice chairman Mike Burgess of Texas is narrating the painful details of fatal accidents in which Cobalt airbags failed to deploy, in some cases in head-on accidents with cars whose airbags did deploy, apparently saving lives. \"Again, it's a tragic situation, any time there's a loss of life in a traffic situation,\" Barra says. \"I can't answer your questions, because it's usually complex as they look at that.\" Then Barra again promises big changes at GM: It was a tragedy and we have apologized.. and that's why we're doing an investigation, to complete a full timeline... and I commit to you, we will take action. From the Comments: a passage from the movie Fight Club, based on the book by Chuck Palahniuk: Fight Club is, of course, strictly a work of fiction. Barra seems a little flustered under questioning by Democrat Bruce Braley, who asks, \"Hasn't the core value of GM always been that safety comes first?\" \"I haven't seen that part before,\" Barra says. Barra says she doesn't know how many parts GM uses that don't meet the company's own specifications: \"I don't know,\" she says...\"The parts that we're using today meet the performance [standards] that they need to ... If we find a part that does not meet the performance, we then do a recall.\" That's not an acceptable answer, Rep. Joe Barton of Texas says. \"There's no reason to have specifications if you don't enforce them.\" As GM CEO Mary Barra continues her congressional testimony, here's a summary of where things stand: \u2022 Barra claimed ignorance of many details of her company's handling of the flawed ignition switch problem, repeatedly saying that she was waiting to find out what happened from an ongoing internal investigation. \u2022 Committee members showed some frustration with Barra's claims of ignorance. \"By the way ma'am, I'm getting this information from the chronology GM provided to NHTSA,\" ranking member Diana DeGette of Colorado said. \u2022 Barra could not explain why GM continued to use the ignition switch after it was determined not to meet GM specifications, and could not explain why, when GM replaced the part, the company did not assign it a new part number. \"I want to know that as much as you,\" Barra told the committee. \u2022 Barra apologized to the family members of the victims of crashes involving faulty GM parts, which have been linked to 13 deaths. \"I am deeply sorry,\" she said. Blackburn asks Barra about the decision not to issue a new part number. \"It is inconceivable, it is not our process and it is not acceptable,\" Barra says. \"Do you believe there was a cover-up, or was it just sloppy work?,\" asks Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee. Barra says that's why she has hired former US attorney Anton Valukas, to find that out. Full committee ranking member Henry Waxman of California asks Barra, \"How can you assure customers that new switches will finally meet GM compliance?\" \"We will do 100% end-of-line testing to make sure the ... functionality of these switches are safe,\" Barra says. But Barra is pleading ignorance so frequently that Murphy jumps in: \"Did you review the documents that GM submitted to the committee?\" \"I did not,\" says Barra. \"There were over 200,000.\" GM stock is up slightly, around .3%, on the day. Family members of victims are in the hearing room for Barra's testimony. Chairman Upton asks who inside GM decided not to use a new part number for the replacement switch, the perception being that a new part number was not assigned to cover up the fact that the part had been replaced. \"I do not know the name of the individual,\" Barra says... \"That is an unacceptable practice. That is not the way we do business.\" Barra's last two answers to questions about how GM handled internal reports of the failing switch: \"I was not a part of that organization at the time, that's why I'm doing an investigation.\" \"I don't know the people who would have been handling that issue at that point.\" Barra's strategy: \"Not my fault but I'll fix it\" \u2013 and for as long as this hearing shall last, I have no idea about the specifics. Ranking member DeGette is annoyed that Barra won't admit to even the basics of what GM knew when, despite the fact that many of the details under discussion come from GM's own internal reports. \"By the way ma'am, I'm getting this information from the chronology GM provided to NHTSA,\" DeGette says. Barra: \"That's part of our investigation to get that complete timeline. DeGette: Well much of this I'm getting from a timeline that GM has already done. Barra: Which is a summary. Murphy is drilling down on when GM decided to manufacture a new switch \u2013 without changing the part number. Murphy quotes an internal finding that \"Cobalt is blowing up in their face.\" Why didn't GM mount a recall at the time, 2006, Murphy asks? Barra shows she's not willing to say much about what happened years ago inside GM. She refers repeatedly to the ongoing investigation: \"Clearly there were a lot of things that happened.. there were a lot of statements made. That's why we're hiring [former US attorney] Anton Valukas [..] I do not know the answer to that, and that's why we're doing this investigation... I can't answer specific questions at this time, that's why we're doing a full investigation.\" Barra says she's prepared for questions. Chairman Murphy goes first. \"Is it common practice for GM to accept a part that it does not meet its specifications?\" No, Barra says. But sometimes a parts purchase \u2013 such as steel, she says \u2013 might not be up to spec, but would be acceptable from \"a safety, functionality, performance\" perspective. Barra promises that GM will do better: I would like this committee to know that all of our GM employees and I are determined to set a new standard. And I am encouraged to say that everyone at GM\u2014up to and including our Board of Directors\u2014supports this. If you haven't yet read Guardian US finance and economics editor Heidi Moore's (@moorehn) take on that particular promise, you can find it here. It reads in part: Less than four months later, it seems foolish that any of GM\u2019s fairy tale was believable to anyone. After the recalls and the estimates of driver deaths, all of that talk \u2013 of the reborn American automaker, of bets paid and dollars won \u2013 seems like a hollow spectacle. And it has to make us wonder: how much were US taxpayers and the government complicit in sustaining a company that researchers had already suggested was unable to compete in the modern automotive industry? Barra's opening testimony is here [pdf]. As previously announced, GM will hire a former US attorney to conduct an internal investigation into how the company handled the switch problem. Barra testified: I\u2019ve asked former U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas to conduct a thorough and unimpeded investigation of the actions of General Motors. He has free rein to go where the facts take him, regardless of the outcome. The facts will be the facts. Once they are in, my management team and I will use his findings to help assure this does not happen again. We will hold ourselves fully accountable. Barra has modified the top of her opening testimony slightly, inserting a sentence about how the ignition switch problems \"did not happen on my watch.\" Otherwise it reads verbatim: More than a decade ago, GM embarked on a small car program. Sitting here today, I cannot tell you why it took years for a safety defect to be announced in that program, but I can tell you that we will find out. When we have answers, we will be fully transparent with you, with our regulators, and with our customers. A Cobalt. Barra is about to begin her testimony. Energy and commerce committee chair Fred Upton asks the big question: \"Why did it take so long to issue the recall?\" \"It was news reports that brought the problem to the nation's attention,\" Upton says. \"This investigation is indeed bipartisan.\" \"I know we have a lot of family members here Mr Chairman,\" DeGette says. \"We're going to get to the bottom of this. We're going to figure out what happened, and we're going to make sure it doesn't happen again.\" According to advance copies of Barra's testimony [pdf], she will apologize to family members and loved ones of victims with these words: Today\u2019s GM will do the right thing... That begins with my sincere apologies to everyone who has been affected by this recall... especially to the families and friends of those who lost their lives or were injured. I am deeply sorry. Ranking member DeGette has brought along a GM ignition switch. She holds it up. \"I just want to show how easy it is to turn this key in this switch,\" she says, jiggling the key in the ignition and showing it switching off. The defective switch was especially a problem, she says, for short driver whose knees were more likely to contact the ignition, and for people who had heavy keychains or \"mom keychains like me.\" Chairman Murphy is working through a timeline of GM's misdeeds, as investigated by the committee. The NHTSA is not spared criticism. \"NHTSA ultimately decided not to investigate, even when the issue was raised three years later, in 2010 \u2013 NHTSA decided against investigating,\" Murphy says. Barra is likely to bear the brunt of the tough questioning in the hearing, but it could get pretty uncomfortable for Friedman too. Barra and Friedman, the NHTSA director, are testifying today before the Oversight and Investigations subcommittee, chaired by Republican Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania and with ranking member Diana DeGette of Colorado. They're about to begin. You can watch a live video stream on C-SPAN3 here. The daughter of a GM worker, Barra joined the company at 18 and served as global head of product development before ascending to her current post, Guardian business correspondent Dominic Rushe (@dominicru) wrote in a profile published in December: The company said the 51-year-old Barra had risen through a series of manufacturing, engineering, and senior staff positions in her 33 years with GM. [...] Barra earned her bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Kettering University \u2013 formerly the General Motors Institute \u2013 in Flint, Michigan. She also holds an MBA from Stanford. Barra grew up in Waterford, a suburb of Detroit. Her father worked for 39 years as a GM dye maker. Read the full piece here. Guardian business correspondent Dominic Rushe (@domincru) writes up six questions that GM CEO Mary Barra is likely to face: 1: What did you know? Barra started working for GM age 18. In 2008 she became vice president of global manufacturing engineering. She moved into human resources but then back into engineering overseeing global product development, purchasing and the supply chain. What did she know of problems with GM\u2019s ignitions and air bags on the Chevrolet Cobalt and other vehicles? What did she do about them? 2: Why didn\u2019t GM make the recalls earlier given evidence the company knew there mounting reports of accidents and deaths going back as far as 2004? 3: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration administrator David Friedman said in his testimony that GM had \u201ccritical information\u201d that was not passed on to the regulator. What was that information, why was it withheld and who withheld it? Read the full piece here. Guardian business correspondent Dominic Rushe points to an NPR timeline of the recall scandal. Here are the first three entries: 2001: GM detects the defect during pre-production testing of the Saturn Ion. 2003: A service technician closes an inquiry into a stalling Saturn Ion after changing the key ring and noticing the problem was fixed. 2004: GM recognizes the defect again as the Chevrolet Cobalt replaces the Cavalier. There are 30 further damning timeline entries where those came from, including these: March 2005: GM rejects a proposal to fix the problem because it would be too costly and take too long. July 29, 2005: Maryland resident Amber Marie Rose, 16, dies when her 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt crashes into a tree after the ignition switch shuts down the car's electrical system and the air bags fail to deploy. Read the full timeline here. What's Barra's apology worth? On its face, not much, says Guardian US finance and economics editor Heidi Moore (@moorehn). Barra is to testify that \u201ctoday\u2019s GM will do the right thing,\u201d Heidi writes \u2013 But there is a dark undercurrent to her words, which will only highlight a truth that is no longer excusable: General Motors spent over a decade misleading the public about mechanical failures in its cars, working to create the false image of a rehabilitated powerhouse of American industry. And it will make you wonder what else GM hasn\u2019t told us \u2013 indeed, what it doesn\u2019t even know yet \u2013 about its $55bn business. \"GM has been good at telling stories that the public wants to hear,\" Heidi writes. Read the full piece here. Today's hearing is titled \"The GM Ignition Switch Recall: Why Did It Take So Long?\" It's an extraordinary test for the newly installed Barra, who became CEO of General Motors less than three months ago. Since then the company has recalled millions of vehicles, apologized for deaths resulting from flaws in those vehicles, estimated its quarterly costs tied to the recall at $750m and faced the prospect of two congressional investigations and potentially hundreds of lawsuits. Last month Barra appeared in a web video announcing steps GM was taking to address the manufacturing flaw and the company's handling of it: \"Something went wrong with our process in this instance, and terrible things happened,\" Barra says. \"We have apologized. But that is just one step in the journey to resolve this.\" Welcome to our live blog coverage of General Motors CEO Mary Barra\u2019s testimony before a US House of Representatives committee investigating the automaker\u2019s handling of a vehicle flaw now linked to 13 deaths. Congressional investigators say GM neglected to warn customers for more than 10 years about faulty ignition switches capable of disabling airbags in Chevrolet Cobalt and Saturn Ion vehicles. GM has recalled 2.6m vehicles for ignition-switch defects and an additional 1.3m vehicles to fix a power-steering issue. Barra will apologize to families of victims and promise a thorough internal investigation, according to testimony submitted to the committee [pdf]. Barra plans to testify in part: More than a decade ago, GM embarked on a small car program. Sitting here today, I cannot tell you why it took years for a safety defect to be announced in that program, but I can tell you that we will find out. Families of three teenagers killed or injured in a 2006 car crash involving a 2005 Cobalt have sued GM for negligence and fraud for not disclosing facts about the defects. The House and Senate are conducting investigations of possible criminal conduct at GM, which expects recall-related repairs to cost $750m this quarter and which could face hundreds of additional lawsuits. Testifying alongside Barra will be David Friedman, acting administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), one of GM\u2019s main government regulators. The House committee said regulators declined to open formal investigations into complaints about the cars on two occasions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
