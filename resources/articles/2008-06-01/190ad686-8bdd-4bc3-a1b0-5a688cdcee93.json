Stapleton's skills get the chance to stretch in this collection of short piano conversations with the cross-genre improviser/composer Matthew Bourne. The music spans minimalist tone-journeys and bursts of dense, jazzy improvising, with dreamy reflections over fast ostinatos, barked low-end percussive drama, and sighing sounds against improv-skitters and rhapsodic melody in between. Both players are formidable generators of free improv, and they build up heat together. But the music often has an unexpectedly delicate charm, whether from a subtle melody being teased out of chord movements, or the sparing use of string-strumming against hypnotic drum patterns on the woodwork. The imperious Of Ionized Air heaves with jazzy figures, and some pieces have a lyrical lilt reminiscent of Keith Jarrett. The recording is careful to protect the nuances on which these two innovators depend."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
