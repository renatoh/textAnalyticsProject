North Korea had earlier described as \u201cvery interesting\u201d Trump\u2019s tweeted offer to meet Kim along the heavily armed border of North and South Korea. \u201cWe see it as a very interesting suggestion, but we have not received an official proposal,\u201d North Korea\u2019s KCNA news agency quoted the country\u2019s first vice foreign minister, Choe Son-hui, as saying. \u201cI am of the view that if the DPRK-US summit meetings take place on the division line, as is intended by President Trump, it would serve as another meaningful occasion in further deepening the personal relations between the two leaders and advancing the bilateral relations,\u201d Choe said, using the country\u2019s official title Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea. In a tweet on Saturday morning, Trump, who is attending the G20 summit in the Japanese city of Osaka, proposed that he and Kim leader meet at the demilitarised zone [DMZ] \u2013 the border separating the two Koreas \u2013 to shake hands and \u201csay hello\u201d. Trump told reporters: \u201cWe\u2019ll be there and I just put out a feeler because I don\u2019t know where he is right now. He may not be in North Korea. If he\u2019s there, we\u2019ll see each other for two minutes, that\u2019s all we can, but that will be fine.\u201d Trump stepping over the line of demarcation separating North and South Korea would be hugely symbolic, echoing a similar gesture made by the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in \u2013 with Kim\u2019s encouragement \u2013 when they met at the DMZ last year. \u201cSure I would, I would. I\u2019d feel very comfortable doing that. I\u2019d have no problem,\u201d Trump told reporters, adding that he believed Kim followed his Twitter account. \u201cI guess he does because we got a call very quickly,\u201d he said. If Kim accepts the invitation it will be the leaders\u2019 first meeting since their denuclearisation summit in Hanoi in February ended without an agreement. Some North Korea watchers interpreted Choe\u2019s comments as a sign that the meeting will go ahead. Commenting on the KCNA reports, John Delury, a North Korea expert at Yonsei University in Seoul, tweeted: \u201cNot to put too fine a point on it, but this is North Korean for \u2018yes\u2019\u201d. The South\u2019s presidential Blue House said nothing had been confirmed at this point and added: \u201cOur position, which hopes for a dialogue between the US and North Korea to take place, remains unchanged.\u201d Trump and Kim have met twice, first in Singapore last June and again in Hanoi in February. Neither summit has produced a comprehensive agreement that would see North Korea abandon its nuclear weapons program in exchange for sanctions relief. But a photo opportunity on the DMZ, no matter how symbolic, is unlikely to go far in resolving their differences on denuclearisation, according to Scott Seaman, director of Eurasia Group Asia. \u201cFor talks to have real legs, either Kim must credibly commit to denuclearisation or Trump must credibly agree to allow Kim to keep some of his nuclear weapons,\u201d Seaman said. \u201cWithout a shared end goal, creating a viable roadmap to reaching it will remain impossible.\u201d Trump\u2019s first months in office were marked by belligerent, personal attacks between the president and the North Korean leader over North Korea\u2019s nuclear program. But since the two met in Singapore last June, the US president has touted a close, personal bond with Kim. That meeting marked the first time a sitting American president had met with the North Korean leader. And when North Korea conducted several weapons tests last month, Trump took up a surprisingly moderate tone. \u201cNobody\u2019s happy about it,\u201d the president said. As he enters his re-election campaign, Trump is reliant on at least the appearance of diplomatic progress with North Korea as his principal foreign policy success. He has repeatedly insisted that the two countries were on a collision course to war before he came to office. He told reporters on Saturday that it was a \u201cgood thing\u201d that he and Kim \u201cseem to get along very well\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s good to get along. Because frankly, if I didn\u2019t become president, we\u2019d be right now in a war with North Korea. You\u2019d be having a war, right now, with North Korea. And by the way, that\u2019s a certainty. That\u2019s not, like, maybe.\u201d Trump\u2019s desire to avoid bad news from the Korean peninsula has given Kim some leverage in his bid to have sanctions eased. But while Trump has so far ignored large-scale sanctions-busting by North Korea, Russia and China, he has shown himself unwilling to lift any part of the embargo formally. As he left the White House for Asia earlier this week, Trump was asked whether he\u2019d meet with Kim while he is in the region. \u201cI\u2019ll be meeting with a lot of other people ... but I may be speaking to him in a different form,\u201d Trump said. Such trips to the demilitarised zone, the heavily fortified border between North and South Korea, are usually undertaken under heavy security and the utmost secrecy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
