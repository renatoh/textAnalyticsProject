The prime minister herself took legal advice about the \u201cmini-saga\u201d, entitled Thatcherism: The Final Solution, which was broadcast on Radio 4 in mid-January 1988, and considered whether she should instruct lawyers to sue for defamation, files released to the National Archives in Kew on Thursday reveal. The item had been written by a listener, Vincent Hill, in a competition for mini-sagas \u2013 stories composed in no more than 50 words. In an exaggerated parody of Tory free-market economics, he imagined the political consequences of a libertarian approach to heroin. The compressed story read: \u201cIngenious: Individual choice must be paramount. With growing confidence she legalised hard drugs. Prices fell sharply. Legitimate outlets replaced bankrupt drug syndicates. Crime figures plunged. Crematorium shares surged. City populations thinned as the weak spirited succumbed. Unemployment vanished. Only the worthiest survived. Nobody could complain. The unfit died of freedom.\u201d Thatcher\u2019s principal private secretary, Nigel Wicks, wrote to the law officers\u2019 department seeking advice. He asked whether the tale was defamatory. \u201cIt is not the prime minister\u2019s normal practice, or indeed wish, to send solicitors\u2019 letters to media organisations which issue statements which defame her,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut I wonder whether this item might not be an exception to the PM\u2019s normal practice?\u201d Thatcher\u2019s office was told by the law officers\u2019 department at the Royal Courts of Justice that the story was indeed libellous. The offending passages included: \u201cThe Final Solution\u201d, in its inherent connotation; \u201cthe unfit died of freedom\u201d, with its innuendo of intention to secure the death of the \u201cunfit\u201d; \u201ccrematorium shares surged\u201d, which was said to be \u201cparticularly revolting \u2026 in its innuendo that this was a consequence desired by the prime minister\u201d ; and \u201cShe legalised hard drugs\u201d, which \u201cpersonalises her as the target for the sting and not mere Thatcherism\u201d. The prime minister evidently decided not to pursue legal action. Her private secretary recorded that she did not want to consult lawyers who specialised in defamation. But the matter did not end there. On 18 January, her husband, using his own 10 Downing Street stationery, dispatched a sternly worded letter to Marmaduke Hussey, who was chairman of the BBC\u2019s board of governors. \u201cDear Duke,\u201d Mr Thatcher wrote. \u201cWith deference may I ask you to study the enclosed manuscript (extract) of the Radio 4 Today programme. The extent and depth of political bias in the BBC is a matter of opinion, but this is a disgrace by any standard, however low. \u201cI cannot believe that the management of a public broadcasting system can continue to employ a producer who publishes so foul and deliberate an untruth against anyone or on such a subject. Surely such gross professional misconduct can neither be excused or condoned?\u201d He signed it: \u201cRegards to you both, Yours ever, Denis.\u201d Denis Thatcher, who was normally careful to keep out of public affairs, rarely appears in the prime ministerial files. Wicks, the private secretary, however, noted that Mr Thatcher had crossed Hussey\u2019s name off a guest list for a public reception a few days later. The civil servant suggested that Hussey should be invited so that the prime minster could talk to him about the \u201cdisgraceful\u201d episode. \u201cYou could then have a quiet word with him about the mini-saga after the reception,\u201d he suggested. But the note was returned with a comment from Denis, explaining his action. \u201cI only crossed out [his name] because I did not think a general reception is (a) suitable for Duke [because he used a stick and might have had difficulty standing for a long time] (b) important enough. I did discuss with PM.\u201d Denis Thatcher explained that he had already privately written to Hussey. \u201cNever in the history of public broadcasting,\u201d he added, \u201chas so foul a libel been published against ANYONE let alone a prime minister.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
