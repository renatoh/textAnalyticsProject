After the first round of parliamentary elections on Sunday, the right won 109 seats, while the left only managed one. But that is only the start. In five days' time, the presidential bloc could get up to 470 out of a total 577 seats, with the opposition left scrabbling around with one quarter of that number. It is all too possible for the turnout in the second round to be as low as it was in the first, and if that were the case the socialist party risks being marginalised as an effective opposition party for the next five years. But none of this should detract from the scale of Mr Sarkozy's political achievement. He has taken the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP), a coalition of the notoriously fractious right, and fashioned it into a personal powerbase. Only a year ago, the UMP was toiling under a clapped-out French president and a government which was tentative and unpopular. Under Mr Sarkozy's leadership, the UMP undermined a government of which he was still a senior member. In the process it acted like a party challenging a status quo of which it was an essential part. The strategy may defy conventional political logic, but Mr Sarkozy has now used it to achieve stunning election victories. He has given the ruling party of an unpopular presidency a stronger mandate under a popular one. Gordon Brown should take note. All of this is down to one man. Only Mr Sarkozy seemed to grasp from the outset that this was a four-stage race, and he has never stopped running. He fashioned his first cabinet to include a combination of socialists and centrists, and so attract a broad appeal which has now shattered both the far right and the centrists. The National Front's vote plummeted from 10.5% in the presidential elections to 4.2% on Sunday and only one candidate, Jean-Marie Le Pen's daughter Marine, will make it into the second round. Francois Bayrou's project of creating a centrist Democratic Movement (Modem) is also in tatters. After defections led by one of his leading stars, Herv\u00e9 Morin, to the pro-UMP camp, Modem has gone on the blink. Mr Bayrou is now left with at most three seats in parliament. And this for a man who at one point in the presidential campaign came close to overtaking Mr Sarkozy. Little wonder that there were frantic attempts yesterday to make tactical voting deals between the socialists and what is left of Mr Bayrou's party. Mr Sarkozy may be a brilliant tactician, but he has been handed his victory on a plate by the socialist party, on whom one can not be tough enough. After all the campaigning, it still does not know what its message is; four or five senior figures within it all have different ideas about what this should be. Yesterday S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal, the defeated presidential candidate, was acting like a party leader by proposing tactical voting deals with Mr Bayrou. And yet her partner Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who is still party leader, appeared to be more hesitant. With the next party congress taking place in the autumn of 2008, the temptation will be to take no decisions and to let everything slide further. There is every chance that the party will continue to do nothing to reform itself. Against an opponent as focused as Mr Sarkozy, internal division is a luxury that no opposition party can afford and it ill serves the French left which needs vision and leadership. Mr Sarkozy will make hay while the sun shines. He will push through his popular reforms first, like tax breaks and reforms to the 35 hour week, in the hope that by the time he comes to harder reforms, such as changing the structure of universities or pension reform, he will have gained the momentum needed to prevail there as well. Until such time as the socialist party sees sense, the only opposition he will face will be on the streets, and at the moment Mr Sarkozy is being shrewd enough to do everything he can to avoid that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
