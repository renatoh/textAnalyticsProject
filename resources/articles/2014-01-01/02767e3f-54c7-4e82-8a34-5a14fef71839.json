The ineffable George Parr, Sir George, Admiral Sir George, General Sir George and sometimes just George Parr MP (Conservative), was played either by Fortune or more often by his partner in comedy John Bird, parrying Fortune's questions. His was the voice of the establishment and from his mouth issued the most flatulent of hypocrisies, the most absurd of justifications and usually something very close to the brutal truth. Explaining the case for the European fighter aircraft prompted by a toy elephant, or unravelling the 2008 crash with an analogy involving rancid milk and incontinent grandfathers, Parr represented all the unmerited sense of entitlement and confounded affront on being challenged that marked a class still mentally struggling to come to terms with the late 20th century. His work was not finished."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
