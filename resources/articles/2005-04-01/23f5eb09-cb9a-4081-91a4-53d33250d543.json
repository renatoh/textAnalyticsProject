And what splendid animals they were - the massive carthorses that bent their efforts to ploughing, harvesting and the like, under the guidance of an experienced farm worker who knew and understood his charges. From Suffolk Punches to Clydesdales, they worked the land through all weathers and provided work for the many associated trades of their handlers. There were ostlers and saddlers to provide harnesses, traces and reins that guided the power of the horses, often working in teams of two. And a farrier I once met, shoeing a riding club pony, years after the working horses had been supplanted, reminisced on his apprenticeship in the 1930s. Shoeing a Clydesdale, he told me, required horseshoes the size of dinner plates, and country blacksmiths throughout the land would have echoed his memories. It was a horse of evident military value that prompted my current train of thought. A stone bearing the inscription, \"Whippy carried Captain Shakespeare, 10th Hussars, at Waterloo, 18th June 1815\" stands against the wall of the church adjoining Boxwell Court. John showed me the church on my recent visit and gave me the guide, written by his father. The impression of a private chapel is enhanced by the memorial tablets to members of the Huntley family which date back to the 16th century. The stone had been found out in cultivated fields and Whippy clearly survived Waterloo to end his days at Boxwell."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
