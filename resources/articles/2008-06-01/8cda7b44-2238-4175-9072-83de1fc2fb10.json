With the release of the band's sixth album, however, the time has surely come for Berman to break out of cult obscurity. Not that any of the songs are, strictly speaking, accessible. At one end of the oddball scale, there's San Francisco B.C., a picaresque crime caper set to skittering guitars, whose cast of characters includes a woman with \"sarcastic hair\" who believes that \"romance is the douche of the bourgeoisie\". At the other, there's Suffering Jukebox, a paean to a machine on the verge of a nervous breakdown, which, judging by the backing track, has a fetish for Fleetwood Mac. But everyone involved - Berman, his wife Cassie on bass, various Lambchop alumni - evidently delights in each song's peculiarities, and their pleasure can't help but suffuse the listener, too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
