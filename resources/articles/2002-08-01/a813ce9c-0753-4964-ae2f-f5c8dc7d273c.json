There is plenty to moan about in the County Championship, where Yorkshire have declined from champs to chumps in a matter of months and languish at the foot of the First Division table with six matches to go. But locals have had to give the coach Wayne Clark and his fellow Australian Darren Lehmann grudging praise for taking the side to the final of the C&amp;G Trophy, where they will meet Somerset. To say that Yorkshire are hard pressed financially qualifies as this year's understatement of the season, but Clark is still pressing hard for the club to sign an overseas replacement for his departing captain. Next week Lehmann joins Australia's squad and he will not be back this season, not even for the Lord's showpiece. Simon Katich was his stand-in earlier this season but is ruled out this time because he is in the Australian A squad. It was another left-handed batsman who will struggle to figure in Yorkshire's plans for the final who provided the main thrust in the floodlit Norwich Union League 28-run victory last night. Vic Craven had a hard act to follow in opening the innings instead of Craig White, the hero of their semi-final victory who was, in common with his England colleagues, rendered unavailable. Craven responded in gutsy fashion to make 59 from 66 balls before becoming one of three victims for Neil Killeen, the leading wicket-taker in the league with 22. Matthew Wood made only five before edging a good delivery from Ian Hunter into Andy Pratt's gloves and Chris Silverwood, who has made a name for himself as a No3 hitter this year, failed this time when he was lbw during an effective spell by Mark Davies. Craven relished the appearance of Danny Law in Durham's attack, hitting lustily to leg to collect a four and two sixes off his first three balls, but Law gained a measure of revenge when he removed Anthony McGrath with the aid of a fine diving catch by Pratt . Durham stayed in contention by claiming the prized wicket of Lehmann for three. Sent back by Craven, he was beaten by Gary Pratt's direct hit from the covers. It should have come as no surprise, for Pratt has been behind 10 such dismissals this season. Craven's innings ended when he drove Killeen's slower ball to mid-off but Gary Fellows and Michael Lumb maintained Yorkshire's momentum."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
