The claim was made in the court\u2019s latest ruling on the socialist government\u2019s tortuous efforts to exhume the dictator\u2019s remains from his hulking mausoleum and have him reburied in the family vault. In the course of explaining why it had decided to suspend next week\u2019s planned exhumation to give Franco\u2019s family more time to appeal against the decision, the court referred to him as \u201chead of state from 1 October 1936 until his death in November 1975\u201d. The assertion was met with derision by experts on the period. The British Hispanist Paul Preston, who wrote a biography of Franco, described it as \u201cbollocks\u201d. He said: \u201cThe only way these people at the supreme court could think this is right, that Franco was head of state from that time, would be if they thought that the military coup of 1936 was totally legitimate.\u201d Preston pointed out that the rebel generals had met in late September 1936 to agree on who should be their overall military commander, or general\u00edsimo. \u201cThere\u2019s a coup and within that coup a certain kind of competition between generals \u2013 a bit like the succession to Theresa May \u2013 to see who gets to be top dog,\u201d he said. A week later, they reluctantly agreed a decree to confirm Franco as head of the Spanish state\u2019s government for the duration of the war, working on the assumption that the monarchy would eventually be restored. Franco\u2019s claim to be head of state had no legal basis, Preston said. Juli\u00e1n Casanova, who teaches contemporary history at the University of Zaragoza, said the head of state at the time was clearly Manuel Aza\u00f1a, the president of the republic. \u201cFranco was named head of the government of the Spanish state by his coup-waging colleagues and that title only existed in the areas they\u2019d conquered,\u201d he told the online newspaper eldiario.es. \u201cManuel Aza\u00f1a was [the head of state] and continued as such until the victory of Franco\u2019s troops on 1 April 1939.\u201d The supreme court did not respond to a request for comment, but Preston saw the judges\u2019 error more as proof of Franco\u2019s enduring legacy than \u201cany kind of deliberate, machiavellian plan\u201d. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you what went on in their minds,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I can say is that this reflects what we call sociological Francoism \u2026 Generations of people were brought up in the Franco regime with everything that that meant: the education system, the media. They were subjected to the brainwashing that the entire nation was subjected to during the Franco regime.\u201d Casanova said a body of good historical writing had been available for years, but that Spaniards were still not learning enough about their country\u2019s recent past. \u201cSpain\u2019s 20th century history, rigorously researched, based on solid sources and filtered by historiographical debates, has taken its time in reaching classroom and universities,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
