The publisher concluded that while Ba\u00f1os\u2019s views are \u201crobust\u201d, they are not antisemitic. How They Rule the World, which promises to reveal \u201cthe 22 secret strategies of global power\u201d, was published by Penguin Random House imprint Ebury Press in April. Author Jeremy Duns began drawing attention to the book after he spotted links between the title and the cover, which bears an image of octopus tentacles. The octopus has long been associated with antisemitism; Hitler refers in Mein Kampf to the octopus of the supposed Jewish conspiracy for world conquest, and it was a frequently used symbol in Nazi-era propaganda. Comparing the Spanish language edition of How They Rule the World with the English text, Duns found a section about the Rothschild family, a banking dynasty subject to many antisemitic conspiracy theories, which does not appear in the English translation. The Spanish edition contains three references to the Rothschilds, none of which appear in the English, including a section that compares their wealth with other rich families, and concludes: \u201cIt is clear that [the Rothschilds\u2019] economic power is gigantic. As is their ability to influence in all senses, an aspect that, when considering their traditional distance from the media spotlight, has led to multiple speculations about their capacity to intervene in key global decisions.\u201d Ba\u00f1os is described by Ebury Press as \u201cone of Europe\u2019s top specialists in geopolitics, terrorism and intelligence\u201d. A colonel in the Spanish army, he was previously the chief of counter-intelligence and security for the European Army Corps. In interviews with Spanish media, Ba\u00f1os has called the Rothschilds dominant and likened them to the Illuminati. On Spanish TV, he also once accused Israel of being behind the assassination of John F Kennedy. Duns accused Penguin of having knowingly published \u201ca Spanish antisemitic conspiracy theorist \u2026 because to cover it up they\u2019ve removed passages about the Rothschilds. I think you\u2019ll agree this is a pretty serious problem we\u2019re facing. As usual, it\u2019s about fact-checking, research, due diligence, and not doing them.\u201d Penguin said it was aware of the \u201cserious concerns\u201d raised about How They Rule the World, telling the Guardian that they had prompted it to take a close look at both the book and the author. \u201cAs a publisher who takes our responsibilities to our readers and our authors extremely seriously, we always undertake careful due diligence before committing any book to publication, and this book was no exception. However, given the serious nature of these concerns, we have undertaken a thorough review into the UK publication,\u201d said the publisher in a statement. \u201cOur conclusion was that whilst the author clearly expresses robust opinions about geostrategies and geopolitics, focusing on the historical, psychological and social reasons for the alleged global domination of many different groups, he does not in our opinion express views in this publication, including in the parts omitted, that are antisemitic. Nor are there any legal concerns with this book or any known reputational issues with the author.\u201d In reference to the cover image, Penguin said that it had selected the tentacles \u201cto reflect the octopus as a symbol of domination by an imperialist power \u2026 This symbolism has been widely used in political imagery from the 19th Century onward by many cultures about their most feared geopolitical rival, which is very pertinent to the subject of the book.\u201d Ba\u00f1os was not available for comment, but tweeted last week: \u201cClassic disqualification to discredit the work of a critical author with power: 1. Non-academic 2. Antisystem 3. Communist 4. Populist 5. Pro-Russian 6. Anti-Semitic. Please, Spies and Minions: Have a little more imagination!\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
