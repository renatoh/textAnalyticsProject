Ahead of the first full week of general election campaigning, the senior party figure also described his sadness that Jewish newspapers had collectively suggested Labour under Jeremy Corbyn would endanger their community, and admitted that the party\u2019s target to be carbon neutral by 2030 would be \u201ctough\u201d to meet. On the NHS, he highlighted meetings UK civil servants had had with US pharmaceutical companies as revealed in Channel 4\u2019s Dispatches, claiming they had met on \u201cnine or 11 occasions\u201d and were \u201cnegotiating to sell our NHS\u201d. The government denies that their intention is for the NHS to be sold into the private sector. Speaking to The Andrew Marr Show on BBC One, the shadow chancellor said: \u201cFrom what we\u2019ve seen of the evidence from the Dispatches programme from civil servants negotiating with pharmaceutical companies, I think it is true.\u201d Asked whether Trump\u2019s statements were enough to remove the worry that the NHS would form part of a possible future partnership, he said: \u201cDonald Trump has \u2026 on this particular issue, made a number of contradictory statements. \u201cWe have to go on the evidence. The evidence, the civil servants, on nine or 11 occasions sitting down negotiating to sell our NHS.\u201d During an interview with the Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, on Thursday night, the US president said outright he was not interested in buying the NHS. However, McDonnell said he should not be trusted. \u201cI do not believe Trump\u2019s assurances and I don\u2019t think many people do,\u201d he said, adding that Labour would end all privatisation in the health service. Tory party chairman, James Cleverly, said: \u201cThe NHS is not for sale, never has been, and never will be. We will never allow any trade agreement to change this fundamental fact and will continue to ensure that patients have access to clinically and cost-effective medicines that are affordable to the NHS.\u201d McDonnell\u2019s warnings about the NHS come as Labour uncovered new figures showing that thousands of operations have been cancelled due to staff shortages and equipment failures, according to data received in FoI requests. Last year, 78,981 operations were cancelled. These operations were either classed as urgent or were elective operations cancelled at the last minute. This was down from 81,565 in 2017-18. The number of operations cancelled because of staffing issues and equipment failures have each increased by a third in the last two years. In 2018-19, 10,900 were cancelled because of staffing issues, while 4,800 were cancelled because of equipment failures. Jonathan Ashworth, Labour\u2019s shadow health and social care secretary, said: \u201cThat so many more people in pain and distress are forced to endure cancelled operations, including increasingly on the day they were supposed to have treatment, is a shameful indictment of a decade of Tory cutbacks running our NHS into the ground.\u201d On climate change, which is one of Labour\u2019s key election policy areas, McDonnell admitted the party\u2019s pledge on emissions, which was passed at its conference, would be \u201ctough\u201d to achieve but it was working on it. The target could be met by its policy announcement about refurbishing homes to put in greener energy provision. McDonnell said the Heathrow airport expansion could be scrapped under Labour\u2019s plans. \u201cWe set ourselves criteria, one of which was environmental impact, the other was also economic impact and social impact. On the current criteria, we\u2019ve said very clearly, Heathrow expansion doesn\u2019t qualify,\u201d he said. Pressed if Labour would cancel the extension, he said: \u201cAt the moment it does not qualify based on the criteria we set out.\u201d McDonnell also said he was saddened that three of the country\u2019s biggest Jewish newspapers had printed damning stories on what a Corbyn government might mean for their community because of his failure to tackle antisemitism among party members. He said: \u201cI am so saddened by this. I just want to reassure them we are doing everything we can. We\u2019re also doing everything we can to educate our own members. \u201cAll the things that they have asked us to do, we\u2019re doing.\u201d Just hours before his interview Labour suspended the parliamentary candidate Matthew Collings, who was due to run in the Tory MP Liz Truss\u2019s seat, South West Norfolk, after it emerged he had called the former chief rabbi Jonathan Sacks a \u201chate filled racist\u201d. Questions were also raised about other social media posts he had made."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
