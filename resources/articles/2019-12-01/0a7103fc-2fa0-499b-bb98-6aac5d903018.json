Sam Johnstone\u2019s own goal five minutes into the second half put the home side ahead but Albion equalised when Charlie Austin struck from close range following an indirect free-kick. The 1-1 draw means Leeds stay top on goal difference, although both teams boast an 11-point lead over Fulham in third. \u201cWe have to be honest enough to admit we weren\u2019t as good tonight as we\u2019ve been so far,\u201d the West Brom manager, Slaven Bilic, said afterwards. \u201cWe started slowly, and we have to admit we didn\u2019t deserve anything more than a point \u2026 but we have to take this as a blessing, because we know we can\u2019t be like this again.\u201d Swansea manager Steve Cooper hit out at referee Jeremy Simpson after his side\u2019s winless run extended to six with a 1-1 draw with Blackburn. Simpson waved away penalty appeals from Swansea after Bradley Dack handled in the penalty area. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the penalty decision back for handball and it\u2019s just a massive error from the referee,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cHe knew it hit his hand \u2013 he has said that to me \u2013 and his hand isn\u2019t next to him, it\u2019s out. He is going to be embarrassed when he sees it back on TV. He\u2019ll probably be refereeing in the Conference.\u201d Dack was later sent off, a decision criticised by Rovers manager Tony Mowbray: \u201cit\u2019s wrong to say, but it felt like he was evening things up.\u201d Both goals came in the opening 10 minutes, Danny Graham\u2019s strike swiftly cancelled out by Andr\u00e9 Ayew\u2019s header. Neil Harris suffered his first defeat as Cardiff manager as Brentford prevailed 2-1 at Griffin Park. Bryan Mbeumo put the Bees ahead with a low finish after fine build-up play by Sa\u00efd Benrahma. Ollie Watkins doubled the lead on 46 minutes before Marlon Pack pulled one back with a long-range drive. Brentford climbed to seventh, leapfrogging Sheffield Wednesday, who saw Moses Odubajo sent off as they drew 1-1 at Derby. QPR forward Bright Osayi-Samuel sealed an away win at Birmingham with a terrific solo goal. The 21-year-old picked up the ball near the halfway line and surged down the left before cutting inside and finishing emphatically. \u201cI think that goal warmed the whole stadium,\u201d said QPR manager Mark Warburton. \u201cAnyone who loves football would have enjoyed that goal. Osayi-Samuel showed his power, his desire and to finish that type of run with that level of quality was first class.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
