Organisers are forecasting that Sunday\u2019s match at Old Trafford will have the biggest TV and digital cricket audience of all time but Arthur swatted away concerns Pakistan might buckle under the pressure of the occasion. Arthur said: \u201cI\u2019m telling our players: \u2018You could be a hero. Your careers are going to be defined by a moment in the game. You do something incredible and you\u2019ll be remembered for ever.\u2019 If we put the perfect game together, we can beat everybody, and the dressing room is very, very confident of that fact.\u201d Pakistan have lost all six of their previous World Cup encounters with India but Arthur believes his mercurial squad \u2013 the youngest in the tournament despite the wizened presence of Mohammad Hafeez and Shoaib Malik, who are 38 and 37 respectively \u2013 are capable of showing a lot more than they have in their four matches, including a brilliant win over England and frustrating defeats to West Indies and Australia. \u201cThat unpredictability tag always sort of hangs around the Pakistan team, but that makes us very exciting as well,\u201d Arthur said. \u201cWe just haven\u2019t grabbed the moments when they\u2019ve presented themselves, and that\u2019s something we\u2019ve spoken about as a group. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 15 incredible cricketers in that dressing room, and we keep stressing to them: \u2018How do you want to be remembered? You\u2019re the class of 2019. What are they going to say about you in history? It presents an unbelievable opportunity for these guys to really make a mark. It only takes one moment of magic.\u201d Arthur was far more expansive in his press conference than the India captain, Virat Kohli, who repeatedly dead-batted questions about the importance and the magnitude of the match. \u201cWe\u2019re not focusing too much on what the opposition has to do or what they will bring to the table,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to believe in our strengths.\u201d Another tried, probing about the pressure of the occasion, but again Kohli refused to bite. \u201cWe understand that any game that you play for your country can be emotional, adrenaline-filled, so no one game is more important or more special for us than the other,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we play well, we can beat any side in the world.\u201d The only time Kohli opened up was when talking about playing against Pakistan in the Champions Trophy in 2009. \u201cYuvraj Singh fractured a finger, and I was literally flown in and in two days\u2019 time I was playing against Pakistan at Centurion,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cI hadn\u2019t experienced anything like that before and I played a very bad shot, and I couldn\u2019t sleep until six in the morning. I was looking at the ceiling and thinking: \u2018That\u2019s it, I\u2019ve flown in, and now I\u2019m finished.\u2019\u201d Assuming there is play \u2013 which is not altogether certain given it barely stopped raining at Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon and more showers are forecast \u2013 then Arthur expects the wicket to be better than many might expect. \u201cWe had a little look at the pitch on Friday and it actually looked pretty brown and flat,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not 100% sure there\u2019s a massive amount of moisture in there, and the wicket is certainly a lot browner than Taunton [where they played Australia] was. So those things will come into the equation in terms of our thinking.\u201d But, like every one of the 28,000 lucky ticket holders, Arthur will watch the morning skies with interest. \u201cThe boys have planned meticulously,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done everything that we can control. We can\u2019t control the weather. Unfortunately, we\u2019ve just got to go by what happens.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
