The often overwhelming number of films that neatly fall into this bracket means that some fall by the wayside, their entire reason for existing boiled down to a Park City premiere. There are many examples that rise above the formula and in doing so, help to distinguish the festival from its peers but too many others fall into self-parody. There was even a spoof trailer back in 2014 that ridiculed what to traditionally expect. Person to Person is sadly such a film, one that\u2019s unlikely to break out from its Utah outing, its self-satisfied indieness failing to allow enough breathing room for anything unique to emerge. The film focuses on one day in New York City as a set of disparate characters all face differing personal struggles. Claire (Abbi Jacobson) is an anxious journalist on her first day, investigating a possible murder with the tutorage of seasoned hack Phil (Michael Cera), and the pair encounter a fixer of watches (Philip Baker Hall) whose work is suddenly under examination. Wendy (Tavi Gevinson) is a socially awkward teen who finds herself on an unwanted double date. Bene (Bene Coopersmith) is a music-loving guy whose latest record purchase sends him on a tour of the city. His friend Ray (George Sample III) lands himself in trouble after he posts pictures of his ex-girlfriend in a fit of anger. Despite producing credits from Joe Swanberg and David Lowery, both of whom successfully launched films at the festival, there\u2019s something disappointingly undercooked about this debut full-length feature from writer/director Dustin Guy Defa. It was adapted from a short and at times, this feels like a number of shorts haphazardly sewn together. There\u2019s a listlessness to the whole proceedings, as if rehearsal scenes were filmed and used rather than final takes. The difficulty with films about a handful of unrelated or vaguely related storylines is justifying the need for them all to be told as one. Within the space of a day we follow New Yorkers as they encounter internal and external crises but there\u2019s little in the way of dramatic conflict or base wit to keep us hanging around to see what happens within each. The dialogue often feels horribly overwritten, especially in the scenes between teenagers which make the characters in Dawson\u2019s Creek seem monosyllabic in comparison. There\u2019s a certain charm conjured up by the cast, however, which, along with a sparky soundtrack of funk and soul tracks, helps to sustain a modicum of interest throughout the slim running time. While Cera\u2019s time in Hollywood\u2019s spotlight was ultimately cut short by the realization that his awkward nice guy shtick is rather limited, he has shown that he\u2019s actually far more skilled at douchebaggery thanks to roles in Youth in Revolt, This is the End and Magic Magic. Defa recognizes this and casts him as a smug, romantically inept hard rocker and its his scenes with Broad City\u2019s Jacobson that almost make the film come alive. She\u2019s as comically adept as ever but underserved by a script that fails to match her. Elsewhere, there are all too brief cameos from Casual\u2019s Michaela Watkins and Atlanta\u2019s Brian Tyree Henry while the ever-reliable Hall provides stoicism if nothing else. This lo-fi \u201cdramedy\u201d (yuck) is so pared back that the scene is set for sharp characterization and witty dialogue to take centre stage but the wait is long and the results, while far from dismal, are largely forgettable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
