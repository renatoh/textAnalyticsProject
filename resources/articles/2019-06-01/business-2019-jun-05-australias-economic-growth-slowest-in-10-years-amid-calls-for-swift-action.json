The Australian economy grew by just 0.4% in the March quarter, contributing to a seasonally adjusted growth rate of 1.8%. The result contrasts with real GDP growth of 2.25% forecast in the budget, meaning the economy would have to grow by 1.3% in the last quarter of 2018-19 to meet the forecast. The Australian Bureau of Statistics figures, released on Wednesday, also show that GDP per person fell for the third consecutive quarter, by 0.03%, extending the \u201cper-capita recession\u201d declared after last quarter. Frydenberg told reporters in Canberra although annual growth had slipped from 2.4% to 1.8%, this was \u201cwithin the range of market expectations\u201d and comparable to other developed economies. He pointed to existing measures including the $100bn 10-year infrastructure package and $1,080 of planned tax cuts for low- to middle-income earners as potential boosters for the Australian economy. Frydenberg said the government would \u201calways look for an opportunity\u201d to bring infrastructure investment forward, such as commuter car parks, but blamed the Victorian government for failing to approve the East West Link and capacity constraints for the lack of shovel-ready projects. The treasurer gave no other sign the Coalition would provide \u201cadditional fiscal support\u201d or seek to reform the industrial relations system, non-monetary levers proposed by the Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe, to boost the economy. The shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said the Coalition\u2019s economic credibility was in \u201ctatters\u201d and the annual growth rate was \u201cfeeble\u201d \u2013 the worst since the global financial crisis. \u201cWe have got a national economy which has gone from being the 8th fastest growing in the OECD in 2013 when the government changed hands, to now being the 20th fastest growing economy in the OECD,\u201d he said. The result was weighed down by falling dwelling investment (down 2.5% in the quarter) and slowing household consumption (down to 0.3%). CommSec\u2019s chief economist, Craig James, usually one of the most bullish forecasters in Australia, said: \u201cThe Aussie economy has lost momentum. And soft consumer spending is the main culprit. \u201cBoth monetary and fiscal stimulus are needed to reduce unemployment and revive inflation. But businesses also need to respond through increased investment.\u201d In seasonally adjusted terms, household consumption grew by 1.8% for the last year, the lowest since June 2013, compared with 2.25% forecast for 2018-19 in the budget. Government final consumption \u2013 particularly in disability and health services \u2013 grew by 0.8% in the March quarter and 5% through the year. Compensation of employees increased by 1.2% in the March quarter, but the household saving ratio ticked up to 2.8%. On Tuesday the Reserve Bank cut the cash rate to a record-low 1.25%, in a bid to bolster a softening economy, and further interest rate cuts are expected. Ben Udy, an economist at Capital Economics, said the Australian economy is \u201coff to a rough start in 2019\u201d with falling house prices likely to blame for slower growth in household consumption. \u201cOverall, today\u2019s data don\u2019t inspire much confidence in the Australian economic outlook,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd given that the housing downturn has so far continued in 2019 we don\u2019t think that weakness was a one-off.\u201d Udy suggested the RBA will likely \u201cbe forced to cut rates to 0.75%, from 1.25% today\u201d. The Australian Council of Trade Unions blamed six years of near-record low wage growth for the result, with the assistant secretary, Liam O\u2019Brien, warning the \u201cwages crisis \u2026 is now slowing the entire economy\u201d. The December GDP figures showed the economy grew by just 2.3% in 2018 \u2013 the slowest in trend terms since March 2015 \u2013 and the December quarter saw growth of just 0.3% in trend terms, which was the lowest quarterly growth since March 2003."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
