Elliot White said he was in a state of shock, and believed he had only been recruited to take part in a burglary with another man at Mr Monckton's home in Chelsea, west London. In the first detailed account given by 24-year-old Mr White to police after his arrest, he allegedly said he had never expected the 49-year-old financier to be stabbed during the raid, which happened on November 29 last year. Mr Monckton's wife, 46-year-old Homeyra, was knifed twice in the back during the raid and left \"on the brink of death\", the court was told earlier. Today, on the fourth day of the trial, the Old Bailey heard details from Mr White's police interview. Mr White, of Shepherd's Bush, west London - whose blood was found at the scene - denies murder but has admitted robbery. He is on trial with Damien Hanson, also 24, of no fixed address, who denies robbery and murdering Mr Monckton, a senior bonds director with Legal &amp; General. Both men also deny the attempted murder of Ms Monckton, and wounding with intent. Mr Hanson claims he has an alibi and did not burst into the Moncktons' home wearing a mask and carrying a knife and a gun, as alleged by the prosecution. Today, the court heard that Mr White had told police in an interview: \"I was with another person. I was aware there was a location where there was money to be made. \"I was told by someone else. I was at a stage of life when I was going through financial difficulties. I was not known for burglary. It was a step I was willing to take at the time. I was taken to the location. I was prepared to commit the offence of burglary.\" His account was read to the court by Richard Horwell, prosecuting. The Moncktons were allegedly targeted because they were wealthy, and Mr Horwell alleged that Mr Hanson - who the jury heard has previous convictions for attempted murder and robbery - was \"obsessed\" with the rich. In his police interview, Mr White said: \"Once the door had been knocked someone came to open it ... who I believe to be Mr Monckton. I was not aware there were people in the house. \"We forced our way into the house. I had a struggle with Mr Monckton. He hit me a few times in the face. I got behind him and managed to restrain him. I got hold of him with two hands round him. Once I had control of him, the other person went to the stairway.\" Mr White said he saw his accomplice \"fighting a lady\". \"I told him [Mr Monckton] there would be no problems provided he did not struggle. There was no problem with him at that stage. When I looked at the stairway I could see she had given jewellery to the other person so I could see they had got the message.\" Mr White said the other person then came over to him and Mr Monckton. \"I could see the lady was in distress. She said a couple of times she was going to faint. I realised she must be injured.\" Mr White said the other man then started hitting Mr Monckton \"in the rib area\". He allegedly told police: \"I did not realise it was anything more than a fist. Within a few seconds, I saw there was a problem with Mr Monckton. He began to fall down. I knew it was not just as simple as just blows. \"I managed to pull him away. I was then attacked by the same person who attacked him while Mr Monckton was on the floor. \"I could see he was injured and I was in a lot of shock and I was surprised, although my adrenalin was pumping. It was something I did not expect to happen. I was really confused and I knew I was really injured. I was aware Mrs Monckton was injured as well.\" Mr White continued: \"I was under the impression I was doing a burglary. I asked him [the other robber] repeatedly what he was doing. That is when the knife went through my arm. It was in front of me.\" He said he had not seen where the other person went to as they fled, and that he had headed for King's Road. Earlier today, the court heard that Mr Monckton could have remained conscious for some time after being knifed eight times by his killer. He had tried to fend off the repeated thrusts to his body and had defence injuries to his hands, Mr Horwell said. The court previously heard that the robbers tricked their way into the \u00a33m home when Mr White posed as a postman with a parcel. Mr Hanson was allegedly waiting behind him, hidden, and helped him push the door open. The trial continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
