The Guardian revealed on Friday that an Israel-based group had gained access to at least 21 far-right Facebook pages with vast followings across the western world. The 21 pages were used to coordinate the distribution of more than a thousand \u201cnews\u201d posts each week to more than 1m followers, spreading disinformation and hate targeting Muslims, promoting far-right politicians and vilifying prominent Muslim politicians. The motive for the operation appears to be financial. The Facebook posts funnelled users to a cluster of ad-heavy websites, all controlled by a single entity. After being presented with the Guardian\u2019s findings, Facebook launched its own investigation and pulled down pages and accounts it says were spamming content for financial gain. Facebook said it did not tolerate hate speech on its platform. But the Guardian has learned that, since the original story was published on Friday, Facebook has been telling users that dozens of the posts distributed through the network meet its community standards. The posts cleared by Facebook include one on Australian Facebook page \u201cAssimilate or Migrate\u201d that falsely associates the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, with the quote \u201cThe killing of Jews by Hezbollah is not terrorism\u201d. Another uses an altered image to depict Merkel with blood splattered on her hands and face alongside a story about Germany\u2019s support for \u201cpro-Hamas\u201d resolutions at the United Nations. A third post distorts news about child brides in Turkey to attack Muslims. The posts were distributed across the network in a coordinated way and drive users back to the cluster of websites, milking the traffic for money. One of Facebook\u2019s core community standards is \u201cauthenticity\u201d, which incorporates restrictions on \u201cspam\u201d, \u201cinauthentic behaviour\u201d, \u201cfalse news\u201d and \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d. But, despite this, Facebook told the users that the posts were acceptable. When asked why the posts were deemed acceptable, a spokesman said Facebook\u2019s investigations into the Guardian\u2019s revelations were ongoing. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken action on a number of pages and accounts, some of which were shared by The Guardian Australia, and we\u2019ll continue to take action if we find any further violations,\u201d he said. The network has been partially dismantled since public reports about its existence. Facebook took some pages and accounts offline on Friday. The coordinated content that was spread through the 21 pages has largely ceased. Many of the websites that received traffic from the Facebook posts have been taken down, fully or partially. That has not stopped calls on Facebook to explain why it did not detect the network sooner. Facebook has repeatedly promised to do more to shut down inauthentic coordinated behaviour, particularly in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica and Russian interference scandals. The network uncovered by the Guardian has been operating for two years with relative impunity, and grew significantly in the months since Mark Zuckerberg apologised to the US congress for the company\u2019s failings. Now, the social media giant is being urged to give evidence to a new Senate inquiry into foreign interference on social media. The inquiry was established by the Australian parliament on Thursday to consider the \u201cuse of social media for purposes that undermine Australia\u2019s democracy and values, including the spread of misinformation\u201d. Its chair, Labor MP Jenny McAllister, said Australians expected \u201csocial media platforms to do more\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve got this right yet, I don\u2019t think the social media platforms have got this right yet and part of the job of this committee is actually to get all of those stakeholders in the room and create a forum where we can have a really good discussion about what are the boundaries, about what is and isn\u2019t acceptable on these type of matters,\u201d she said. A separate Guardian US investigation in November revealed a number of white nationalist pages were operating openly on Facebook eight months after a promised ban on such content came into effect. Two of the pages named in the report were subsequently banned."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
