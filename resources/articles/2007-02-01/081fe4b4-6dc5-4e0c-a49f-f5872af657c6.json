A court in Brussels ruled today that the search engine had infringed the copyright of several newspapers after it included their stories in its news services. But experts said the judgment could prove a pyrrhic victory for newspaper owners. Copiepresse, a group representing copyright holders in Belgium, started legal proceedings against Google last March on behalf of 18 French- and German-language newspapers. It had argued that Google News, which runs short extracts of stories from around the world, infringed authors' rights. Lawyers for Copiepresse said Google was harming the interests of newspapers because some stories could be read for free via the search engine even after they had been placed behind a subscription wall on the original websites. Google's lawyers had countered by labelling Copiepresse as protectionists who ignored the beneficial effects that links from its pages brought publishing organisations. However, in a series of hearings last year, Google had been ordered to remove all stories, photos and links to the news-papers in question along with potential fines of up to \u00801m a day for non-compliance. Today's ruling confirmed that decision, but saw the judge slash the fine to a maximum of \u008025,000 a day - although it is still not clear what Google will pay as it removed links to the websites in question after the ruling last year. \"Google is disappointed with the judgment, which we will appeal,\" said a spokeswoman. \"We believe that Google News is entirely legal.\" Danny Sullivan, the editor in chief of SearchEngineLand.com, said that though the judgment was a minor blow for the search engine, it was only a partial success for litigious European media owners. \"Google's not going to be pleased that they didn't score the victory here,\" he said. \"Copiepresse have certainly rallied a group of publishers together, and Google clearly will cut some deals with the application of pressure ... but I think it's not even really a thorn in their side.\" Mr Sullivan added that the decision marked an end to the wider ambitions of media owners to force Google to pay them for the right to use their stories on its news pages. \"It really makes a mockery of the whole argument in the first place,\" he said, \"because their goal was really to try and force Google to pay for the content on Google News.\" \u00b7 Email business.editor@guardianunlimited.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
