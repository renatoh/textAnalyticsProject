It's too easy to forget that barely 30 years ago London was a city where growth was stagnant and the population in decline. Now it has become the engine of prosperity for the whole south-east region, but its very success risks the regeneration of England's other cities, some of which are struggling still to recover from the slow collapse of manufacturing. On Monday the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts Manufactures and Commerce launched a city growth commission, chaired by the outgoing chairman of Goldman Sachs, Jim O'Neill, who happens to be a Mancunian. If banks were part of the problem, then maybe a banker could be part of the answer. But there's more to it than strategies for growth. Political power, and with it the power to shape the economic climate, has been sucked out of local cities for generations. It's a trend driven by better communications, mass democracy and bigger government, and it has left Britain among the most centralised states in the developed world. Politicians tend to believe two conflicting things about this trend. They think they can't deliver on their commitments to the voters without it, but they also recognise, privately at least, how it sucks innovation and enterprise out of communities, leaving local councils struggling to meet the demands of the centre regardless of how appropriate they are for the people they represent. Recognising that devolution should be part of the answer is a long way from delivering it. The coalition set off boldly three years ago, with a city deal programme for eight \"core cities\", a Whitehall fund for city-specific projects to unlock growth. But central government is breathing down the cities' necks at every step. Now, from Manchester to London and Bristol, the cities are fighting back. They represent half the population and generate half the national economy, but control just 5% of tax revenue. So they've launched a challenge to regain the power to fund their own policies, starting with control of all property-based taxes. Dubious politicians might remember that letting a thousand flowers bloom is one way of identifying what works. \u2022 This article was amended on 29 October 2013. An earlier version said the Royal Society had launched a city growth commission. It was a different organisation, the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts Manufactures and Commerce."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
