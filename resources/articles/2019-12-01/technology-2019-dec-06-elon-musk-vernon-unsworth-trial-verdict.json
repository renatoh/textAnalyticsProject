Musk shook hands with his lawyer at the close of the four-day trial in Los Angeles. He did not address Unsworth, whose team had told the court earlier on Friday the Tesla CEO should pay at least $190m in damages for his tweets about the diver. \u201cMy faith in humanity is restored,\u201d Musk told reporters in the hallways of the courtroom. \u201cI came here for a verdict and unfortunately it was not what I expected but I respect the jury\u2019s decision,\u201d Unsworth said after emerging from the courtroom about an hour after the verdict was read. \u201cThe challenge that was thrown down by Elon Musk was that if you don\u2019t sue it\u2019s true,\u201d said his lead attorney, L Lin Wood. \u201cWe sued because it\u2019s false.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m unhappy with the verdict because I think that [Unsworth] deserved a different brand of justice, but he had the courage to come to this country where Elon Musk lives and accept his challenge,\u201d Wood added. \u201cHe sued him. It\u2019s not true.\u201d Mark Stephens, Unsworth\u2019s solicitor in the UK, said: \u201cIt is a pity that a bullying billionaire has been able to cast such a long shadow, and I just hope that nobody else has to go \u2026 toe to toe with Mr Musk.\u201d The case pitted a 64-year-old financial adviser earning a salary of about \u00a325,000 ($33,000) against one of the richest and most famous men in the world. The dispute stemmed from the Tesla and SpaceX chief\u2019s ancillary involvement in the Tham Luang cave rescue in June and July 2018, which saw 12 young football players and their coach successfully extracted from a flooded cave system by a team of British cave divers. On 13 July 2018, after the successful completion of the rescue, Unsworth said in an interview with CNN that the rescue pod Musk had delivered to the cave site was a \u201cPR stunt\u201d, adding that he should \u201cstick his submarine where it hurts\u201d. A video clip of the interview went viral, drawing the ire of Musk. The billionaire entrepreneur responded in a series of tweets on 15 July, suggesting that Unsworth\u2019s presence in Thailand was \u201csus[picious]\u201d and calling him \u201cpedo guy\u201d. Musk eventually deleted the tweets and apologized to Unsworth. He apologized again from the witness stand and contended, \u201cI did not accuse Mr Unsworth of being a pedophile.\u201d While much of the evidence presented to the jury over three days of testimony involved the details of the cave rescue and the aftermath of Musk\u2019s tweets, the jury was tasked with determining whether a reasonable person would understand the tweets to mean that Musk was calling Unsworth a pedophile. Musk\u2019s attorneys argued that the tweet was not a statement of fact, but an insult, which is considered protected speech. They also attempted to show that Unsworth\u2019s reputation had not been seriously damaged because his efforts in the rescue operation were rewarded with an MBE, a medal from the Thai king, and other honors. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s not the most common insult,\u201d Musk\u2019s attorney, Alex Spiro, said during closing arguments. \u201cYou\u2019re free to speak certain things in this country.\u201d Spiro further argued that Musk\u2019s statement should never have been considered unlawful behavior. \u201cFederal courts are not meant for people who insult each other,\u201d he said. Unsworth testified that \u201cbeing branded a pedophile\u201d had made him feel \u201chumiliated, ashamed, dirty\u201d. \u201cI was effectively given a life sentence without parole,\u201d he said. \u201cIt hurts to talk about it.\u201d His attorneys introduced evidence of the broad dissemination of Musk\u2019s tweets, which were reported in 490 English-language articles on 361 websites in 33 countries. They also introduced evidence of Musk\u2019s behavior after the 15 July tweets, including his hiring of a private investigator to seek proof of Unsworth\u2019s \u201cnefarious behaviour\u201d. The investigator was actually a conman, but Musk relied on his false information when he called Unsworth a \u201cchild rapist\u201d in an email to a BuzzFeed News reporter in August 2018. \u201cElon Musk is a liar,\u201d said Wood, Unsworth\u2019s attorney, in his closing argument. Musk, who attended court Friday for the first time since his testimony, raised an eyebrow at the remark. Wood pointed to inconsistencies in Musk\u2019s testimony, tweets, and communication with a reporter. He compared the impact of the \u201cpedo guy\u201d tweet on Unsworth\u2019s life to a \u201cnuclear bomb\u201d, with invisible but lasting affects. In explaining his suggestion of a $190m in damages, Wood said of the billionaire: \u201cWhat he needs is a hard slap on the wrist.\u201d The jury ended up deliberating for less than an hour. The foreman, Joshua Jones, said the panel decided that Unsworth\u2019s lawyers spent too much time trying to appeal to their emotions and not concentrating on the evidence. \u201cThe failure probably happened because they didn\u2019t focus on the tweets,\u201d Jones said after the verdict was announced. \u201cI think they tried to get our emotions involved in it. In a court of law you have to prove your case, which they did not prove.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
