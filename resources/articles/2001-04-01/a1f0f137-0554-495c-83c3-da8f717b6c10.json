The \"unexpected and very disappointing\" outcome from the final stage of clinical trials followed the failure of the same substance in trials on tuberculosis sufferers in 1997. SR Pharma's shares, which once traded at 600p, fell by 241p to 72.5p. Business development di rector Thomas Long said: \"We're very, very disappointed. This was going to be the route by which we were going to get on to the commercial market.\" SR Pharma was founded nine years ago by John Stanford and Graham Rook, two doctors from University College, London. While working in Uganda, they noticed that exposure to certain microbes appeared to increase resistance to infection. The company has developed a refined version of these microbes, called SRL172. Attempts to prove its effectiveness have been unsuccessful. Yesterday's results showed that taking SRL172 failed to prolong survival rates in a trial involving 418 patients undergoing chemotherapy. The company's market value fell to \u00a317.3m, only a little above its cash reserves of \u00a311m. Mr Long said SR Pharma hoped that a new version, SRP299, would work on asthma and dermatitis patients. \"We've been very encouraged by its progress so far. We know the drug has an effect on the body's natural immune system.\" Analyst Lionel Wilson of Nomura said: \"This again highlights the risk and reward profile of biopharmaceuticals.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
