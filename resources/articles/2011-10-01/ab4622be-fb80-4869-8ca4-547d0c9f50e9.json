Ireland secured their knockout spot with a victory over Armenia on Tuesday evening. Their best hope of claiming a place at next summer's finals, it has been generally assumed, was drawing Estonia; the Baltic state have never featured in a major football tournament or even a play-off for one. Trapattoni, however, is cautious. \"Absolutely not,\" Ireland's manager replied to the suggestion he had wanted to draw Estonia. \"When I said that the teams are all strong to get to this stage, I meant it. I have already spoken to people who know them. They beat Serbia and Slovenia and put Italy under a lot of pressure. Let's not make the common mistake to underestimate them. They have some really technically gifted players.\" Estonia finished 10 points short of Italy, the winners of Group C, seeing off the challenge of Northern Ireland on the way. Ireland were only two points behind Russia, the winners of Group B. \"Let's say that the statistics in this case have only a marginal value,\" Trapattoni said. \"These matches are like cup finals and anything can happen. Undoubtedly, the small advantage that we do have, is that we are playing the second game at home. Let's not delude ourselves that we have made it the finals already. We have two tough matches ahead. \"I am a football man. I do not ignore the threat that this team represents. Only superficial observers would think that this is an easy tie. The players will know this and I know this. Why are we favourites? What notions that you have in your heads that make us favourites? This is an international team which like us has made it to the play-offs.\" Trapattoni is not, therefore, willing to admit it would come as a major shock if Ireland do not progress to Poland and Ukraine. \"That is just not true,\" the Italian said. \"We are playing against a team who has the same right to be there as us. They had a good qualification campaign and have earned their place at the play-offs though hard fought results, like us. I would not like that we have become big headed \u2013 a Brazil, Argentina, Spain, or Germany overnight. Have we forgotten where we are in the Fifa rankings?\" Trapattoni said he has already spoken with the Italy coach, Cesare Prandelli, about Estonia's potential threat. \"He was my player and he has given me good advice,\" Ireland's manager said. Trapattoni also claimed to be unaware whether or not the Football Association of Ireland will open talks about extending his contract before the play-off matches. The 72-year-old's present deal expires after the European Championship. For Ireland, progression to the finals would partly offset the infamous handball by France's Thierry Henry which helped to earn his side a controversial goal for a late draw which put an end to Ireland's hopes of a place at the last World Cup. \"Certainly the suspicions that the authorities wanted the big countries in the tournament left a bitter taste,\" Trapattoni recalled of that play-off set-up. \"This is not the case this time as it has been clear all along what will happen.\" The Czech Republic, who pipped Scotland to second place in Group I, have been handed a tie against Montenegro, the nation which claimed a play-off spot courtesy of a draw with England on Friday night. Montenegro finished six points adrift of Fabio Capello's team but a point ahead of Switzerland in Group G. The most high-profile \u2013 and potentially most competitive \u2013 of the games will see Turkey face Croatia. The countries are placed 27th and ninth respectively in Fifa's world rankings. In the remaining tie, Bosnia will be the underdogs to defeat Portugal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
