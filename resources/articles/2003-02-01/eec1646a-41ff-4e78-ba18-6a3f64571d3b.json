It somehow never lived up to its billing. It was hard on the eye. Last year France put in a first half of incomparable efficiency and grace. This year both sides slumped into an opening period of error and slow, slow possession. It was summed up by the delayed clearance by Charlie Hodgson, a right footer that was charged down by Olivier Magne. The wing-forward then produced a rare flash of genius to control the ball with a pat forward to himself before crossing the line. But such flashes were so very rare. Hodgson did produce one jink of his own, but failed to spot Greenwood on his inside when the hard work was done. It was redemption and doubling of guilt in an instant. But Hodgson was not alone. There was supposed to be an edict this year that the referees were under instructions not to tolerate any killing of the ball at the breakdown. Well, this edict must have been binned by Paul Honiss. It wasn't his fault that the players kept on grappling for the ball, or entering from the wrong side, or lying off-side, or generally being as tribal as ever, but he might have lib erated the field of a few of them. The yellow card was crying out for use. It rather summed things up when in the 12th minute of injury-time we had a little spat that led to yet another penalty and yet another obligation to let play run. Blimey, we'd had enough by then. Just blow for full-time and let's be done. So high had it been built that perhaps it was inevitable that it would fail to deliver. Magne had his moment but Jonny Wilkinson was as perfectly metronomic as ever. He slid past 600 points in Test rugby and scarcely did anything other than keep things ticking over as usual. England, of course, had designs on much more than the tick-tick of the regular. They had Hodgson outside Wilkinson, a small centre that must have made Serge Betsen's eyes light up. France's player of last season, their players' player of the year, their tackling tornado, had these little guys to target. But things broke down before the centres could either break or be broken. The game was a scrap-heap of activity. Pass after pass scuttled along the floor or hit the target too high, too adrift. Too demanding. And in the middle of all the failing show there was Jason Leonard. He came on to a roar to make tears well, he went off with a knee injury before he had a chance to do something that would actually elicit a flicker of emotion in the old boy. That was another summary of the day. For the record, Wilkinson kicked four penalties into the freezing breeze to give his side a lead that was as prosaic as the movement all around him. And then, at last, things perked up. In the second half, and just for a sparkling few minutes, England shifted through the gears. Patiently and yet dynamically they pieced together their drives. They kicked a bit to the corner and they chipped behind the defence. And they combined the lumps with the artistes. Ben Cohen ran into midfield off his wing, prompting Ben Kay and Martin Johnson to make gallops of their own. A long pass by Greenwood opened up the line for Jason Robinson. Greenwood might have described the game as dreadful but it did have this sublime moment. Wilkinson kicked a penalty and then a drop goal. The game was over. Perhaps it would be show-time. The French looked dispirited. Ever since they were penalised at the scrum in the first half for lifting the front rows, they had seemed drained of will. But we were at least guaranteed one twist to the plot. England were about to cut loose, and instead France came back at them. Goodness knows what inspired them - well, it was the arrival of Thomas Castaign\u00e8de off the bench, I suppose. The imp was suddenly straightening attacks, and instead of shipping the ball into traps, France were in space. From free-kicks they scored once, through Clement Poitrenaud, then twice through Damien Traille. Somehow, the game then stretched towards eternity. On and on it went, over the 80 and into the 90s. But England were hardly flustered. Their defence had lapsed but they quickly closed ranks and the game dribbled on and on and on. It should say wonderful things about England's cham pionship that they can creak at the start and yet beat their arch-foes handsomely. Their campaign is under way safely, and their unbeaten run at Twickenahm now stretches to a staggering 19 matches. But, there must always be a but. It was dreary. It shows how difficult it is to turn on the tap and unleash lashings of beautiful warm water. And like it or not, there is a bigger picture here. There is the thought that All Blacks and Wallabies will be looking at this unsatisfactory opener and thinking that if England cannot turn it on at home in the Six Nations, then in eight months' time in the World Cup it will be even harder for them. This, in turn, may be no bad thing. The tag of number one in the world is a badge of being overpriced. This performance was adequate, no better than that. But it mercifully released some of the hot air we have all been emitting at this emotional time. It's a Six Nations thing. We overdo the romance and expect too much. So, we can all sit back now and watch the odds lengthen on England for the grand slam. And we can all start practising putting our fingers over our eyes for the day England travel to Cardiff. England on day one did little more than shake some cobwebs off. That's not dreadful, just a stern warning to the rest that somebody somewhere - presumably wearing red - had better watch out.
