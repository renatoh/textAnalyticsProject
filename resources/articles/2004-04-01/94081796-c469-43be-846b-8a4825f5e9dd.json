In our front page report, Attacks halt rebuilding of Iraq, yesterday, we neglected to update the casualty figures, saying that since the beginning of April \"nearly 100 US troops have died, the worst monthly total since the invasion of Iraq.\" In fact, the figure has exceeded 120. In a report headed Debut novel from Nigeria storms Orange shortlist, page 9, yesterday, we said no Nigerian writer had previously reached the final of either the Orange or the Booker. We overlooked the Nigerian writer Ben Okri, who won the Booker prize in 1991 for The Famished Road. An article posted on our website, April 26, incorrectly attributed to the Confederation of British Industry the statement that manufacturing orders had reached a nine-year high over the past three months. In fact, what the CBI reported was that the balance of manufacturers saying that orders had increased in the past three months compared to those who say that they have decreased was a net 18%, the highest net figure since 1995. It says nothing about the absolute level of orders. This has now been corrected on the website. The painting, The Farm, by Alexis Rockman, pages 12 and 13, G2, yesterday, was accidentally reversed (it was supplied to the Guardian like that). Apologies. Brigalia Bam, shown in a photograph with President Thabo Mbeki, page 22, April 26, is the chair of South Africa's Independent Electoral Commission, not the \"International Elections Commission\". Albert Einstein, in a photograph, page 16, April 26, is shown in front of Fuld Hall, the first building of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, New Jersey. Einstein was a professor at the institute, which, to be clear about it, is an independent institution, separate from Princeton University, with which, however, it enjoys close, collaborative ties. The clarinettist and former winner of Young Musician of the Year mentioned in our TV review, page 22, G2, yesterday, is Emma Johnson, not Helen Johnson. Homophone corner, from TV review, page 22, G2, yesterday: \"There could be a timpani roll, or a crash of symbols as they're ejected from the front door.\" \u00b7 It is the policy of the Guardian to correct significant errors as soon as possible.
