The AFP raided the broadcaster earlier this month over a 2017 report into the clandestine operations of Australian special forces in Afghanistan. The raid on the public broadcaster\u2019s headquarters came just one day after the AFP raided the home of a News Corp political editor over articles she published in 2018 on proposals to expand Australia\u2019s domestic surveillance capabilities. The Australian reported on Monday that News Corp will also mount a legal challenge against the AFP raid on Annika Smethurst\u2019s home. The ABC chair, Ita Buttrose, and ABC managing director, David Anderson, strongly condemned the raids on the public broadcaster earlier this month. \u201cIt is important that Australians be advised of this action and of the determination of the ABC to defend our journalists and the crucial work they do informing the public,\u201d Anderson said on Monday. \u201cThe ABC is asking the court for a declaration that the warrant was invalid on several technical grounds that underline the fundamental importance of investigative journalism and protection of confidential sources. \u201cWe are also challenging the constitutional validity of the warrant on the basis that it hinders our implied freedom of political communication. \u201cThe ABC is also seeking a permanent injunction to prevent the AFP accessing the material seized and to return it to us immediately. It is currently being held by the AFP in sealed envelopes.\u201d The application won\u2019t be heard until the end of July at the earliest and the AFP has given the ABC an undertaking not to access the seized files. Anderson told staff that management would use \u201cevery avenue\u201d over the next few weeks to defend journalism and the public\u2019s right to know. The ABC has partnered with commercial media including News Corp and Nine Entertainment to push for legislative change. In a rare show of unity, Anderson, executive chairman of News Corp Australasia Michael Miller and Nine CEO Hugh Marks will speak at the National Press Club on Wednesday. Miller had an opinion piece published in the Sydney Morning Herald on Monday calling on governments to protect journalism and the three media executives are co-ordinating their legal efforts against the AFP."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
