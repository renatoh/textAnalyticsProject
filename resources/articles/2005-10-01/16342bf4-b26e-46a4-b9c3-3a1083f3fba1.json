As with John Latham's work God is Great #2 being excluded from his Tate exhibition, the museum's director cited responsibility for the safety of staff and visitors (Response, October 11). In 1992 it was the aftermath of The Satanic Verses affair, now it is July 7. I wanted to leave a space in the gallery where the painting had been, but I lost my fight. When the exhibition toured, in one city it was shown in a protective booth with an \"offence warning\" outside after discussions with local Muslims, and in others it was shown regardless. There was never any trouble. We are in a sorry state if artists cannot question questionable belief systems for fear of (theoretical) violence.
