Slim's empire is built on ownership of the dominant fixed line telephone company in Mexico which is called Telmex and, along with his mobile phone giant, has interests throughout Latin America. Flores said that any negotiations to buy the Honda team would not have involved the 67-year-old anyway but rather his eldest son and apparent heir, also called Carlos Slim. Slim Jr is a racing enthusiast. He heads the Escuderia Telmex or Telmex Racing Team and played a key role in bringing Nascar racing to Mexico City in 2005, the first time it had been held outside the United States. Flores, Telmex's corporate communications spokesman, said the denial came directly from Escuderia Telmex. The Mexican sports publication Cancha said Slim Jr had responded to an emailed question about the possibility of taking over the Honda team with the words \"It's a lie\". In an interview last year Slim Jr said he would not try to take the Telmex team to formula one until the right Mexican driver was found. Honda announced it was looking for a buyer for its formula one team in early December after a disappointing year. The Japanese manufacturer blamed the economic crisis and the team's $300m budget and staff of 700. There has been interest in buying the team from David Richards, chairman of the rally specialists Prodrive. Richards previously ran the Honda squad as British American Racing and may have support from the Kuwait-based Dar Investment company, but nothing yet suggesting any sort of firm commitment. The Indian tycoon Vijay Mallya, whose Force India formula one team is based at Silverstone, has also been linked to Honda. However, any offer would be related to the technical resources at the Brackley factory rather than ownership of the team. One of the major headaches for any potential buyer is the fact that the new owner will almost certainly not continue to benefit from a Honda engine-supply deal. Honda have always been extremely protective and secretive over details of their engines and, within hours of the news breaking that the team would be quitting formula one, all the highly tuned 2.4-litre V8s were collected from Brackley and returned to the company's engine base at Bracknell. That problem could be surmounted by reaching a deal to use the supply of Ferrari engines now available following Force India's decision to switch to Mercedes power in 2009. However, such a move would mean extensively redesigning the chassis of the Honda RA109 to take an engine for which it was not originally designed, a move which would almost certainly mean the team would continue struggling at the back of the grid in 2009."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
