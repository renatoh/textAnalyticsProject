Cooke's performance on Saturday came too late to earn a place at the Lions' training camp in Bath this week. But Noble stressed yesterday that players who did not make his initial 40-man pool can still force their way into the final squad of 25, naming Cooke, the Salford hooker Malcolm Alker and Warrington's converted second-row Ben Westwood as the strongest contenders. The Lions coach confirmed that Cooke's Hull team-mate Paul King has withdrawn from the Tri-Nations squad to have wrist surgery at the end of the season. Other absentees from the two-day session in Bath were Leeds's Kevin Sinfield and the Wigan pair of Kris Radlinski and Terry Newton. Sean Long, the St Helens scrum-half, has expressed his interest in joining South Sydney next year despite being contracted to the Saints until 2007. \"I've always wanted to play in Australia and, if I'm going to go, it will have to be now,\" Long said after the Souths were revealed to have made an approach to the Saints chairman Eamonn McManus. St Helens' chief executive Sean McGuire, however, dismissed the possibility of him being released early. The Saints forward Jon Wilkin, who was put on report in Saturday's semi-final defeat by Hull for an alleged spear tackle, will not face disciplinary action."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
