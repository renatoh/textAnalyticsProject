On Wednesday a picture story on page three of the Oz took aim at the ABC political editor, Andrew Probyn, for \u201cpossibly\u201d posing as a Liberal politician behind a pot plant in a re-enactment on 7.30. \u201cMystery surrounds the identity of the person \u2013 possibly the ABC political editor Andrew Probyn \u2013 who appears in the scene with his face obscured by objects, including an office pot plant,\u201d the story said. Labelled with a big red \u201cexclusive\u201d, the yarn took media reporter Lilly Vitorovich two days to stand up, possibly because she was frustrated by the refusal of the ABC to confirm that it was indeed Probyn behind the pot plant. But Oz staffers say not to blame the Oz\u2019s new media reporter, Vitorovich, because she was handed a \u201cshit sandwich\u201d by those on high. \u201cIt is not the first time Probyn\u2019s reporting has been in the spotlight,\u201d Vitorovich said in an apparent reference to Coalition complaints about the ABC\u2019s reporting of the byelections. When Canberra press gallery colleagues Chris Uhlmann and Phillip Coorey posted photos of themselves hiding behind pot plants, Probyn retweeted them. Despite widespread mocking on social media, and the hastag #jesuisprobyn, the Oz was still in hot pursuit of their mystery man on Thursday. This time Vitorovich teamed up with media editor Darren Davidson and sought the views of well-known ABC critics: the former ABC chairman Maurice Newman and the former media watchdog chief David Flint. Newman elevated the mystery to a cover-up: \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you have to have this cover-up \u2013 what are they covering up?\u201d The accusation that Probyn has done anything wrong or unusual is absurd because journalists often stand in for characters in the process of making television or radio, or even podcasting. As the Oz would be well aware, a long list of its own journalists \u201cacted\u201d in the hit podcast The Teacher\u2019s Pet, including media diarist Stephen Brook, business reporters Andrew White, Scott Murdoch and Turi Condon, sports editor Wally Mason and deputy editor Petra Rees. Cash for comments The Brisbane supreme court ordered the broadcaster Alan Jones to pay more than $3.4m in damages for defamation of a Queensland family on Wednesday, a record sum after Rebel Wilson\u2019s payout was reduced on appeal. The local News Corp tabloid, the Courier-Mail, gave the story a decent run but Jones\u2019s home state paper, the Daily Telegraph, buried it with three paragraphs on page eight. While Jones works for radio station 2GB, which is owned by Fairfax Media, he is a favourite son of the Murdoch empire. Jones allegedly played a key role in bringing down Malcolm Turnbull and has his own show on Sky News\u2019 After Dark line-up, Jones and Co. Nine\u2019s political editor, Chris Uhlmann, famously called Jones and stablemate Ray Hadley and News Corp \u201cbullies\u201d and \u201cplayers\u201d. There was a nugget hidden in the Jones judgment, in a reference to Nick Cater\u2019s role in the saga. The Spectator, in which the article appeared, has an extremely limited readership of 3,000. Happy as Larry? When Guardian Australia revealed that the ABC\u2019s latest attempt to improve morale was a series of thank you cards featuring a character called Larry, one staffer memorably said: \u201cIt\u2019s like the Wiggles for grown-ups. I mean, who the fuck is Larry?\u201d Well, we\u2019ve found Larry and we can confirm he is not an actual employee of the ABC. Larry is the actor and stand-up comedian Dylan Hesp, who had his first big break on ABC TV\u2019s comedy Sando earlier this year. Management liked him so much they signed him up to be the face of ABC Principles, in which staff are encouraged to give each other Larry cards for being a good colleague. Back to school Staff at the Australian have been undertaking compulsory face-to-face legal training this week. Reporters, editors and subeditors attended sessions held in-house over two days. Sources say this is unusual because legal training is usually done online, if at all. It may be in response to a damaging finding in the supreme court earlier this year. The newspaper was found in contempt of Victoria\u2019s judicial system after publishing a series of stories that referred to the criminal history of construction union boss John Setka before he faced court. Blackmail charges against Setka and another Victorian unionist were dropped in May. The Australian has pleaded guilty to contempt and is trying to mitigate damages by demonstrating that staff are being retrained, sources say. A spokeswoman for News Corp did not respond to a request for comment. Fake news A few days after Tonightly with Tom Ballard left the stage, the ABC announced production had started in Melbourne on an \u201cexciting new weekly panel show\u201d called Tomorrow Tonight. We weren\u2019t the only ones to ask if the name was a joke, given that Ballard and co had bowed out with a gag about a rightwing version of the show, working title \u201cTorightly\u201d, and an episode set in 2068 called \u201cTomorrowly\u201d. Tomorrow Tonight will be hosted by the comedian Charlie Pickering and the journalist Annabel Crabb and will feature a panel of experts and comedians discussing a fictional news story. Pickering: \u201cI\u2019m excited to take a break from making fun of the news to have a go at making up some news of our own, which could all turn out to be true any day now.\u201d Crabb: \u201cThe escalating lunacy of domestic and global events in recent years is a sombre reminder to us all that we should be prepared for things to get even weirder. Tomorrow Tonight is \u2013 under these circumstances \u2013 a cornerstone obligation of the ABC charter. Jokes included at no additional public expense.\u201d Awkward encounter Bulldogs fans were delighted to see a photo of the Daily Telegraph\u2019s rugby league journalist Phil \u201cBuzz\u201d Rothfield enjoying a night out with a scantily clad \u201csex bomb\u201d sitting on his lap. Delighted because it followed Rothfield\u2019s strong defence of the paper\u2019s story about Bulldogs players mucking up at a private party for which they copped a massive fine. Rothfield said the players were mugs for \u201cgetting naked in a public place in such a disgusting manner\u201d and got into a heated argument on television after authorities imposed a $250,000 fine. The photo got a lot of attention when it was retweeted by Fairfax Media\u2019s Kate McClymont who coyly asked \u201cwhere was Buzz\u201d. Soon after, Rothfield contacted her to say he doesn\u2019t go to \u201cgrubby events and was at a Lions Club kids\u2019 cancer charity at Doltone House, Sylvania. \u201cUnbeknown to me some of the hostesses were wearing lingerie,\u201d Buzz said. \u201cPut it this way, I was smiling for a good cause.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
