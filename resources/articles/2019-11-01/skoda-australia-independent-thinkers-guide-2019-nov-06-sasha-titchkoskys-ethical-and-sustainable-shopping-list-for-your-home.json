Here\u2019s her list of the best homewares that are locally and ethically made, material and quality conscious, packaging aware, and pay regard to social impact. Milingimbi Art and Culture Centre (top) and Elcho Island Arts (bottom) in Arnhem Land, Northern Territory. Indigenous art smarts When buying Indigenous art, Sasha advocates buying from art centres or galleries that are members of the Indigenous Art Code. Even better, visit the Darwin Aboriginal Art Fair, Desert Mob at Alice Springs, Tarnanthi Art Fair at Tandanya in Adelaide, Cairns Indigenous Art Fair or Revealed in Fremantle. At each of these fairs there will be opportunities to talk to artists and other community members and hear their stories. And you\u2019ll know you are buying ethically. \u201cOne of the advantages of being able to go to the fairs is that you get a real sense of what is going on across Australia, which is really exciting,\u201d Sasha says. \u201cIt\u2019s not all about acrylic dot painting from the Central Desert. If you are starting out or don\u2019t have a huge budget, there are often great works on paper or prints that can be a great entry point.\u201d Unpacking packaging \u201cI always make purchase decisions and ranging decisions based on packaging, or even better, the lack thereof,\u201d Sasha says. \u201cI haven\u2019t used these products yet myself but New Zealand brand Ethique makes body and hair products that come in bar form, like soap, taking plastic bottles out of the beauty equation.\u201d Green wash A mature mangrove tree, cools the atmosphere; equivalent to 3 room sized air conditioners. Another brand that is reducing packaging and eliminating harmful ingredients from the home environment is Happi Earth. \u201cIt\u2019s a great option for your laundry,\u201d Sasha says. \u201cThere\u2019s no plastic packaging, it uses soap nuts and natural oils, and they plant trees in mangroves for every purchase you make. And it works!\u201d Sofa so good Investing in quality furniture with a view to keeping it for the long haul and reupholstering if needed is smart shopping, Sasha says. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to us that people start buying products that are designed to last a lifetime. This is the best way to reduce our environmental impact and we believe it\u2019s our obligation to make sure we do this with everything we make.\u201d A case in point is the locally made, VOC-free and sustainable lounging option, the Brolga sofa. \u201cI had come across a new tanning method for leather that was much better for the environment as it used olive leaves for the tanning agent, a by-product of the olive industry,\u201d Sasha says. \u201cWe finally tracked a supplier down and it\u2019s now the standard leather we use on this range.\u201d The Brolga Collection (there are also two chairs, coffee and dining tables and a bench seat) has Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified timber frames and the pieces are finished with a water-based, zero-gloss clear coat. Social network Ngalya / Together: a collection of lighting designs created in collaboration with six Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander art centres. Detail of Wirra Walykumunu (Beautiful Bowl) by Tjanpi Desert Weavers. Ten years ago Koskela embarked on a social impact project, working with the weavers of Elcho Island Art to develop light shades hand-woven from locally harvested plant fibres, coloured with natural dyes. The initiative has generated almost $800,000 for the artists and art centres thus far. In August Koskela launched Ngalya (Together), a stunning lighting collection to mark the 10-year anniversary of the program. Six Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander art centres from around the country were involved in producing contemporary pieces for commercial and residential spaces. Special touch Another favourite discovery of Sasha\u2019s is Kontex bath towels from Japan, made from organic cotton. Specialisation results in finely tuned techniques and end products, Sasha says. \u201cThese towels are a beautiful example of slow manufacturing techniques. The organic fibres used by Kontex are fine garment quality that would break if used on modern weaving machines. They use traditional low-speed machines that weave more gently so the towels are super soft.\u201d Handmade Sasha is drawn to products that contribute to the reinvigoration of traditional crafts and techniques, whether local or from further afield - such as the hand-loomed Nobsa rugs made by a small family-owned business in an area of northern Colombia renowned for its wool industry. The word Nobsa translates to \u201cthe valley retreat of noble weavers\u201d in an ancient, Indigenous language. \u201cThe design is also really lovely, with the longer centre creating the illusion of a smaller rug on top of a larger one,\u201d Sasha says. \u201cEach of them is slightly different. Products that revive these old crafts and techniques are special \u2026 their irregularities enable you to see the hand of the maker.\u201d Local heroes In a world where mass-produced furniture and copycat interiors are prevalent, it is a joy to connect with a furniture item that comes with a story - particularly if it\u2019s close to home. Town N Country stools by Nicholls Design are locally designed and made in a workshop at a rural property in Narre Warren North, Victoria. \u201cLook for original designs and support local makers working with raw materials,\u201d Sasha says. \u201cThese solid timber stools are great for seating or as side tables or bedside tables. It\u2019s a simple, honest design.\u201d Woolly wonders When the price of wool plummeted in the drought-stricken Queensland country town of Tambo in 1992, a group of local women put their shoulders to the spinning wheel. The result? Snuggly Tambo Teddies made from sheepskin. \u201cThey wanted to do something to assist the wool industry, create employment and attract some tourists,\u201d Sasha says. \u201cThey now employ 15 people on a part-time basis and their teddies have been given to families all around the world [including Prince Harry and Meghan]. They\u2019re gifts that are designed to last, support this small women-led business, and they are just so cute!\u201d Upcycling upside Waverley Mills is the oldest working textile mill in Australia that can weave blankets. Based in Launceston, Tasmania, and established in 1874, the mill has been pioneering the use of recycled fibres. Its latest collection uses recycled denim and wool to produce beautiful throws. Ethical gifts Christmas gifting comes with responsibility in a world crammed with stuff. Koskela applies rigour to the process to hunt down fit-for-purpose, high-quality, environmentally innovative, B Corp or social enterprise goods at all price points. \u201cWe\u2019ve found Kriss Kringle gifts for under $30 that fit some of these criteria too - Apiary Made beeswax wraps featuring fabrics ethically produced in collaboration with Warlukurlangu artists, locally made ceramics, mushroom growing kits locally made beauty products busing botanicals and without nasty ingredients in them.\u201d Research no further: test drive the \u0160KODA Kodiaq today."}, "isHosted": false}}}
