The What Not to Wear presenters are filming a fly-on-the-wall documentary to be broadcast on the iVillage.co.uk website, modelled on Larry David's acclaimed US comedy Curb Your Enthusiasm, which charts their \"journey to get back to the top and re-establish themselves as Britain's lifestyle queens\". Called Trinny and Susannah: What They Did Next, the reality programme follows the pair as they embark on what they call a \"revealing\" and \"entertaining\" show. The idea was sparked after Constantine became upset about negative press coverage. She told the Guardian: \"It came about from a very bizarre process. One weekend I had the Scissor Sisters staying and I read a Sunday Times article which said the next time Trinny and I should be on TV should be our own hanging. \"I burst into tears and Scott Hoffman said to me: 'What is this, it's the kind of thing normally used for world leaders.' He said to me we should do something along the lines of Curb Your Enthusiasm. I spoke to Trinny about it and we started developing it.\" Constantine and Woodall have not been on TV together in the UK since ITV decided not to recommission their makeover show last year. They were hired from the BBC in 2005 but their series of ITV shows, such as Undress the Nation, did not deliver high enough ratings for the commercial broadcaster. The pair say they turned to the internet to air their new programme because they wanted to \"make a production where we're in control\" and because traditional broadcasters are \"scared to take risks\". Woodall said: \"We don't know the outcome. It's not necessarily our journey back to the top, it's discovering where we want to go. It's not just going back to doing makeovers.\" Constantine added: \"It's been a deliberate break from being on network television. The audience does become jaded. We wanted to be at the forefront of another idea.\" The pair said they are in talks with three UK and Australian broadcasters about airing a half-hour version of their show once it has aired on iVillage.co.uk. The documentary will be shown in 16 six-minute episodes from mid-June. The production has been co-funded by iVillage, shopping centre owner Westfield and video distribution network t5m. Constantine said the programme shows \"us to be two women who don't take themselves that seriously\". \"It's very funny in place and sad in others. It's an entertaining show as well as a revealing one,\" she added. She went on: \"It's Trinny and I leading our lives which are quite extreme. We cover all areas, our hang-ups, what drives us... .\" Woodall said: \"And there's a twist to this programme, which you'll have to watch to see.\" Constantine said: \"It's so exciting because we feel like we're creating a blueprint for other talent who are frustrated by the traditional commissioning model.\" \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
