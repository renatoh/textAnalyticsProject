Interest rates have come down on many savings accounts this month, and further reductions are likely this year. Millions of us are struggling with the transition from times of high inflation to the low inflation environment current in most of the developed economies. The transition could be difficult because consumers may still base their expectations and behaviour on the high inflation years, but the new trend itself is positive. 'Low inflation is good for the economy as a whole, even though nominal returns are lower,' the Financial Services Authority said last month in its new paper, 'Low inflation: implications for the FSA'. Volatility in the returns on our savings should be reduced, which should be par ticularly welcome to the millions of homebuyers who suffered the torments of negative equity in the early Nineties. Financial products such a mortgages and insurance should become easier to understand, and there should be less opportunity for salespeople to make their plans look fantastic merely by building inflation into their calculations when the real return is unimpressive. People who have been mis-sold personal pensions or endowments will immediately realise the benefit of this. But during the transition, many consumers will be in unfamiliar territory. As the FSA paper says: 'Advertising that emphasises past returns achieved in periods of higher inflation may confuse people about prospective returns.' Until they have a chance to sit down and think about it they may not understand why a 5 per cent return on a savings account now is so much better than a 15 per cent return in the late Seventies. A major concern is that people will be tempted to buy risky products because they promise the high level of nominal returns that consumers have become used to. The number of people with stock market investments - excluding those in their pension plans - has risen from 3 million in 1979 to 12.5 million now. With the current volatility on the stock markets, many are wondering where to put their money. Joe Swanson, of financial adviser Massow Rainbow, says some investors are still expecting annual returns of 12 per cent or more on shares. 'That's the wrong view to take,' he says. 'You've got to expect to hold these invest ments for four or five years as a minimum.' And the Nineties experiences of getting more than 20 per cent in many years on UK equities are not expected to be the pattern of the future. Returns could be far more modest. In the short term, the Bank of England base rate, which dictates ordinary savings and lending rates, could fall even further than the present 5.5 per cent. Chris Lynas, fixed interest fund manager at accountant Smith &amp; Williamson, believes another 0.25 per cent cut is a 50-50 possibility on Thursday. Although another cut later in the year is possible, he does not expect to see base rates going lower than 5 per cent. 'You can see an uptick in inflation if you look 12 months out,' Lynas adds. 'And base rates could be up towards 6 per cent again.' Top survival tips \u0095 Pay off your debts. Consider paying off some of your mortgage if you have spare cash, says Chris Lynas of accountant Smith &amp; Williamson. \u0095 Build up a cash buffer. Redundancies are on the increase and you could need cash to meet your mortgage payments and other necessities if the worst came to the worst. \u0095 Opt for a repayment rather than an interest-only mortgage, says Ray Bulger of adviser John Charcol. This way you are constantly chipping away at the capital rather than leaving it to the end of the term, a far riskier strategy. \u0095 Shop around for savings accounts. Although low inflation is pulling down savings rates, some institutions are offering better rates in order to build market share. See databank, page 12. \u0095 Be sceptical about products and schemes that seem to offer income markedly above the going rate. You can get better returns on risky investments but you can also lose all your money. If you are investing in emerging markets or in complicated products you need to be able to afford to lose your investment. \u0095 Consider other forms of investment. John Wriglesworth of the Wriglesworth Consultancy favours investing in bricks and mortar. ('We are an overcrowded island, with a high divorce rate and people living longer. People have not stopped buying houses.') Others may be less enthusiastic about property. More cautious investors may be looking at fixed rate products. And the well-off might think of venture capital trusts, schemes that offer tax relief on investments in small businesses that are thought to have good prospects."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
