The answer is in your hands. Feast is the Guardian\u2019s weekly cookbook and it\u2019s packed with delicious recipes, whatever your tastes and kitchen skills. Flexitarian? Try courgette, ricotta and spinach dumplings with tomato sauce if you\u2019re cutting down on meat. After a snacky brunch? We have toast toppings that upgrade your basic avocado. Need a summer dessert to wow guests? Let me recommend a very special strawberry and rhubarb custard tart. Launched last year with the tabloid Saturday paper, Feast brought together the paper\u2019s peerless and much-loved cast of food writers in a new home. From Weekend magazine, revolutionary flavour magpie Yotam Ottolenghi, \u201cnew vegan\u201d Meera Sodha, and Thomasina Miers, queen of the simple fix. From Cook, award-winning vegetarian cook Anna Jones and Italian kitchen diarist Rachel Roddy. From G2, Felicity Cloake with her \u201cPerfect\u201d experiments and Great British Bake Off\u2019s Tamal Ray. The idea was simple: all their recipes would feature in one beautifully photographed, practical, collectable magazine, refreshed with drinks recommendations from Fiona Beckett and spiked with restaurant reviews by the brilliant Grace Dent, who rejoined the paper as restaurant critic. We\u2019ve since introduced more cooks \u2013 sweet-toothed stuntman Liam Charles and eco-chef Tom Hunt \u2013 along with a run of great guests: Samin Nosrat, Jos\u00e9 Pizarro, Alastair Little, Sabrina Ghayour, Bosh!, Jack Monroe, Nieves Barrag\u00e1n Mohacho and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall to name just a few. We\u2019ve done vegan, \u201ccheat\u201d, barbecue, picnic, Mexican, Moroccan, Italian, Middle Eastern, French and curry special issues. For our student extravaganza, Ottolenghi ingeniously devised a three-course meal based on two tins of chickpeas - our young readers and their parents gobbled it up. Some people say our recipes are time-consuming and use many hard-to-find ingredients. I loved the Daily Mash joke about the couple who spent eight days making a \u201cquick, easy midweek supper\u201d from the Guardian. OK, I did find myself blanching hazelnuts at 1am on a Sunday and I had to make my own olive tapenade because I couldn\u2019t grab it locally \u2013 and I live in Clapham, south London, where you usually have a choice of pomegranate molasses \u2013 but that was just a fluke. Most large supermarkets and good grocers stock everything we use thanks to the Ottolenghi effect and there\u2019s the internet if your spice rack needs an upgrade. When designing the magazine, the launch team thought about what, apart from the incredible roster of writers, would make it indispensable to home cooks. Stunning photography throughout, shot in our distinctive overhead, pared-down style. The recipes would fit on a page, so there would be no fumbling while following them. Before settling on the high-quality matt paper, I smeared olive oil, tahini and soy sauce over it to check it stayed legible. I hope it\u2019s standing up to your miso, kimchi and yuzu stains, too. We were convinced readers would want to treasure their growing bundle of cookbooks so we made binders, which hold six months\u2019 worth of issues, and are now available again via our online bookshop, having initially sold out in double quick time. But what makes Feast a keeper are the recipes themselves. Guardian foodies are adventurous eaters and loyal readers. They trust our cooks to get it right and testing is key to this. Our superb food stylists make all the dishes for our shoots, and that\u2019s when we get to hear which are the tastiest or, rarely, would benefit from a tweak. The reason our recipes typically work so well is that they get made many times before publication \u2013 anywhere from three to six times in Ottolenghi\u2019s development kitchen, for example, before they go to his tester in Wales. Miers spends a day working on ideas with others, retesting dishes at home in the night \u201cif it just doesn\u2019t taste delicious enough\u201d. Jones makes her dishes first time in her kitchen, then a professional tester tries them, then she makes them for the shoot because she does her own styling. Bakes often need more testing and adjusting because the chemistry is crucial: her custard tarts had \u201cabout 10 tests\u201d. In her well-known Perfect series, Cloake tries six versions of a dish before combining the best of them in a definitive version. Many people wouldn\u2019t dream of picking up an apron without checking if her huge archive includes their wish-dish. Of course there is an occasional hitch. When a filling doesn\u2019t set or a mix splits, we hear from the readers\u2019 editor. If we\u2019ve left out something important, we\u2019ll fix it online \u2013 like the time we omitted to say it\u2019s best to prick aubergines before baking and two exploded inside a poor reader\u2019s oven. Sorry, again. We love to hear from readers and help with your culinary dilemmas in our Kitchen Aide column. A sample of the challenges we\u2019ve addressed: how to get kids to eat veg (any deviousness counts); how to make the perfect brownie; the best ways to store cheese and to poach an egg; and how to make meringue chewy and tofu tasty (fry it). A reader who can\u2019t stomach chilli wrote to ask why we use it so much and what to replace it with. Chief culprits Sodha, Ottolenghi, Jones and Miers replied with loads of ideas (herbs, smoked garlic, pepper, lemon or just leave it out.) We\u2019re also full of ideas about how to avoid throwing away food \u2013 or at least Tom Hunt is, in his zero-waste column. Don\u2019t pour aquafaba (the gunky water in cans of beans) down the sink \u2013 turn it into meringues or mayonnaise instead. Put leftover lemon rind in a salad with capers. Guardian readers care about what they\u2019re eating and its impact \u2013 especially when health, animal welfare and the environment overlap. The most-read food piece of 2018 on theguardian.com was a Harvard professor\u2019s claim that coconut oil is \u201cpure poison\u201d. The third was a piece by Bee Wilson about how bacon is killing us, which won an award from the Guild of Food Writers just this week, along with our very own Grace Dent. Sustainability is a hot topic \u2013 ditch that almond milk, advised one piece. We aim to publish recipes for fish that gets a green light on the Marine Conservation Society\u2019s Good Fish Guide (the app\u2019s handy for shopping). Like many people, we\u2019re thinking about how much meat to eat. Recipes about chicken are always popular but our second most-read food article in 2018 was headlined: \u201cAvoiding meat and dairy is \u2018single biggest way\u2019 to reduce your impact on Earth.\u201d Overall, we\u2019re publishing fewer meat recipes this year, but a lot of you aren\u2019t giving up meat entirely any time soon. The most popular Perfect recipe published since 2017 is for boeuf bourguignon (although the second biggest is for roast cauliflower), and our most liked Instagram posts are generally hearty and carnivorous: Ottolenghi\u2019s ribs and meatball traybake (although the biggest was Jones\u2019s 30-minute brunch of poached eggs, polenta and asparagus, while a shot of Miguel Barclay\u2019s \u00a31 vegan potato arrabbiata was a huge hit). Whatever you eat, we have inspiration. Now, what do you fancy for dinner?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
