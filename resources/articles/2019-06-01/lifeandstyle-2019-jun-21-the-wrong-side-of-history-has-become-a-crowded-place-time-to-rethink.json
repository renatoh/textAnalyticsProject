Time to rethink", "bodyText": "Earlier this month, as the bundle of disordered impulses currently serving as president of the US prepared to fly to London, the city\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan, argued in this newspaper that the visit would put Britain on \u201cthe wrong side of history\u201d. I tend to agree the trip shouldn\u2019t have happened, if only to guard against the risk of a national cheeseburger shortage, but it\u2019s time we dropped that \u201cwrong side of history\u201d argument. Like the crevice down the back of a sofa, full of coins and old bits of Play-Doh, the Wrong Side of History has become a crowded place in recent years. Among those consigned to it have been Brexiteers, anti-vaxxers, vaccine proponents, feminists who don\u2019t accept the idea of gender as an innate essence, the leftwing Somali-American politician Ilhan Omar, and Benjamin Netanyahu. When the online publication Vox asked a panel of experts what we\u2019d look back on with shame in 50 years, answers included the war on drugs, laws restricting the purchase of sex, and meat-eating. But perhaps what we should really look back on with shame is banging on about the right and wrong sides of history. A clue to the problem came when the ethicist Karen Swallow Prior, responding to Vox, nominated abortion as the thing we\u2019ll come to agree was an immoral horror. The average progressive would object vehemently, of course. But who\u2019s to say Prior is wrong? Appealing to the judgment of history involves consulting a bunch of imaginary people from the future, so it\u2019s hardly a surprise when they turn out to agree with whoever is doing the consulting. The point isn\u2019t that some things don\u2019t improve as history unfolds. I assume we can all agree that the world\u2019s a better place now that life expectancy is longer, women have the vote and smallpox has been eradicated. The fallacy is that we can expect a progression toward betterness thanks simply to the passage of time. As the political theorist Jacob Levy put it: \u201cUnderstanding \u2013 and doing \u2013 the right thing is hard, an ongoing struggle that every person and every generation faces. Ideologies of history as moral progress try to make it easy.\u201d Khan opposed Trump\u2019s visit on the persuasive grounds that \u201cthe far right is on the rise around the world, threatening our hard-won rights and freedoms\u201d. But that helps to show why the \u201cwrong side of history\u201d idea makes no sense. If the far right\u2019s eventual defeat were guaranteed, there would be much less to worry about. The real hazard, though, comes when the idea is used by contemporary pontificators to avoid confronting the possibility that they, themselves, might be wrong. Once you\u2019re confident of history\u2019s position, you needn\u2019t ask whether your critics might have a point; you can dismiss them as anachronistic fuddy-duddies who haven\u2019t caught up with the latest advance toward moral truth. The irony is that it is a good idea to reflect on the judgment of history \u2013 not to reinforce your opinions, but rather to unsettle them, and infuse them with a dose of humility. The past is full of periods when people endorsed ridiculous or horrifying views, but they evidently didn\u2019t think so at the time. Why should any of us be immune, just because our time happens to be now? Watch this In a talk on the Royal Society of Art\u2019s website, the philosopher and arch-pessimist John Gray argues that we do learn more moral ways of living as history advances \u2013 \u201cbut they don\u2019t stay learned\u201d. oliver.burkeman@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
