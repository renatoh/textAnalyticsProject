The remuneration committee at Future, which publishes titles including Total Film and Classic Rock, said that it had bolstered her pay following a review of her remuneration package against a peer group including 12 media companies. This found her basic salary fell \"significantly below the median\". \"Following detailed consideration and benchmarking, the committee decided to increase the chief executive's salary from \u00a3305,000 to \u00a3400,000, which is closer to median,\" said the chairman of Future's remuneration committee, the former ITN chief executive Mark Wood. \"When considering employment cost to the company in prior years, the cost of the new salary to the company is still less than previous costs.\" But a spokeswoman said the salary increase would not lead to a massive increase in Spring's total remuneration package because the mix of salary, incentives and share options had been rebalanced. The company's remuneration committee will pump up her basic salary for the year to the end of September 2010 by \u00a395,000, some 31%, to \u00a3400,000. This year, Spring was paid a basic salary of \u00a3305,000 as part of a total remuneration package of \u00a3378,000 to the end of September, according to the company's annual report and accounts published today. This was a 31.7% year-on-year fall compared with 2008's \u00a3554,000 package, due to Future freezing bonus pay outs this year. Last month Future reported a 61% year-on-year fall in pre-tax profits in the year to the end of September with a solid performance in the UK operation offset by weakness in its US business. A spokeswoman for the company said that no decision had been made as to whether performance-related bonuses would be re-instituted as Future begins its new financial year to the end of September 2010. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
