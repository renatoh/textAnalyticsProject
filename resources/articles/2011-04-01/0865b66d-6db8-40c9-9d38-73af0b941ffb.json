The deaths from spinal injuries of Dooneys Gate and Ornais were shocking and TV viewers had their noses rubbed in the fact of what had happened by the shots of Ornais under tarpaulin as the field was directed round him on the second circuit. I need no persuading that the welfare of each racehorse is a matter of great importance to the sport's participants and to those who run racing but I should think a fair proportion of Saturday's audience now hold the gravest doubts on that subject. Such doubts have been vigorously expressed in comments on the Guardian's website and in contributions to radio phone-ins over the last two days. The National has been the subject of several safety-inspired revisions over the past quarter-century and, though some traditionalists have fumed, that policy can hardly have ruined it since Aintree sold out on Saturday for the first time in decades, while 8.8m watched from their living rooms. The only appropriate response to two deaths is to consider whether more can be done. The first change I would make would be to turn away runners as young as seven or as old as 13. Such horses struggle to cope with the National; no seven-year-old has won since 1940, no teenager since 1923. These age limits suggest themselves. It would not change the nature of the race, since there are only a handful of those ages each year, with plenty of nine- and 10-year-olds waiting to take their places. There might sometimes be a horse aged seven who is equal to the National's test, just as there are some people aged 15 who can drive. It is just not appropriate to let them try, especially when their failure can put others at risk. At the other end of the scale, the drop in ability from 12 to 13 seems dramatic for most chasers. It is possible that the goodwill of some spectators could be restored by a ban on jockeys using the whip to make horses go faster. After Ballabriggs had attacked that course with such courage, it was a miserable thing to see Jason Maguire's whip slashing repeatedly towards his hindquarters. Maguire is hardly to blame, even though he earned a ban for excessive use. The rules also require him to make every effort to win the race and there will be no mercy for the jockey who loses a National through lack of commitment. We have many excellent horsemen in the weighing room these days. Let them find a way to motivate their mounts without the stick, not just in the National but in any race. Neither of these changes would have saved Dooneys Gate or Ornais. They might, however, still be breathing if the ground had had rather more give. Instead, and despite artificial irrigation, hot weather dried the surface to the extent that the race-time was the second-fastest in history. When the ground dries, the runners go faster and there is less of a cushion beneath them, both factors increasing the chance of a broken bone. But the RSPCA's David Muir reports the going was no faster than good on Saturday and he makes no criticism of the course management. There have been fatalities even in soft-ground Nationals but it seems at least logical that easier ground should reduce the risk. If softer going is impossible to achieve in balmy weather, then perhaps the race should be run at a different time of year. Surely no one thinks it a good idea just to turn up next spring in the hope of a happier outcome."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
