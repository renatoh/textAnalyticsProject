The 11-second clip from question time showed MPs raising their hands, set to the 1999 track Be Faithful by American rapper Fatman Scoop. The video was synchronised to show MPs raising their hands in response to the lyrics : \u201cYou got a hundred dollar bill, get your hands up! You got a fifty dollar bill, get your hands up!\u201d Song lyrics not featured in the video but well known to its devotees include the question \u201cwho fuckin\u2019 tonight\u201d, racially explicit terms: \u201cTo all my niggas that they hit it from the back / Who want to have sex with no strings attached\u201d. The use of the song was derided on social media, with Labor parliamentarians particularly critical of the light-hearted video. \u201cThe full lyrics of the song used in my earlier video from QT today were just not OK. When I found out, I asked the team to take it down,\u201d Morrison tweeted late on Thursday night. The original social media posts included a personal message from Morrison that \u201cQT was on [fire] today, good work team\u201d. On Friday Morrison said that the video was \u201ca bit of fun but it\u2019s quite clear that that\u2019s not a song that\u2019s on my playlist\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to connect honestly with people,\u201d he told reporters at Bronte Beach in Sydney. \u201cAnd some of the narks will get worked up about this sort of thing but it was a bit of fun.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
