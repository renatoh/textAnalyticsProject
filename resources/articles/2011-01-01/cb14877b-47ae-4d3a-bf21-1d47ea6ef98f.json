The men were injured when a waste incinerator exploded at Sterecycle in Rotherham at 2.40pm, South Yorkshire police said. A 42-year-old Rotherham man was airlifted to Leeds general hospital but died later, while a 50-year-old Barnsley man was taken to Sheffield's Northern general hospital with serious, \"potentially life-changing\" head and body injuries. He is said to be in a stable condition. Police and fire brigade investigators visited the scene to examine the cause. \"Emergency services were called to Sterecycle, a business close to Magna Science Adventure Centre, after a waste incinerator exploded creating a hole in the side of the factory and causing damage to parked cars across the road,\" a police spokesman said. A spokesman for South Yorkshire fire and rescue said four crews were sent and at least one of the injured men was brought out by firefighters. According the Sterecycle website, the plant is the world's first commercial autoclave waste treatment facility, steam processing \"black bag waste\" to recover recyclable material and organic residue which can used to make a biofuel. Sterecycle chief executive officer Tom Shields lauded the safety of the technology last month. \"It's safe, increases recycling performance and reduces the amount of waste going to landfill by up to 70%,\" he said. The site was visited by energy minister Charles Hendry last month as part of a tour focused on the area's low carbon development."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
