'I'm sure I will be,' he said. 'That's what has happened before and I'm sure it will happen again.' The Sunderland striker started his first game for Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson and lasted for just under an hour before making way for Robbie Fowler of Liverpool. 'I enjoyed it thoroughly, though,' Phillips added. 'I was delighted to get my chance under Sven and I thought I played okay. I only played for 60 minutes and Sweden are a tough side but I was quite pleased with my game. No doubt I will be judged on not scoring but I'm happy enough. 'I was a little disappointed to get only 60 minutes but when you have three world-class strikers on the bench you know it will not be a full run-out - which I probably need at the moment. There are two months until the next squad so I have to keep scoring goals for Sunderland. 'The manager said I had played well and he was disappointed for me that I had not scored. If he is that pleased for me, then I'll make the next squad. If not, then I know my chances of making the World Cup has diminished. Trevor Sinclair was happy with his display: 'I was delighted to play because the call up has been a long time coming.' He also admitted that he was not sure he had been fouled in the incident that gave England their first-half penalty. 'I was just about to kick the ball when I lost my footing - I don't know if the defender caught me or not.' Manager Eriksson said he hoped England would put the record straight against his home country - England have not beaten Sweden since 1968 - in the World Cup finals. 'I'm told we have not won since 1968 so it would be nice to put that right next year in the finals,' he said. 'I thought at times we played some good football but at other times we allowed Sweden to play too much. Certainly, we have to be better next June - and we will be better.' Goalkeeper Nigel Martyn was disappointed with the Sweden goal. He said: 'There was not a lot I could do. The free-kick went under the wall which disappointed me - it was one of those things and I saw it very late.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
