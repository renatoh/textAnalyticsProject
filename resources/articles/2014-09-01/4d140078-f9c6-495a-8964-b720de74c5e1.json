The Financial Times reports that both publishers are claiming victory. It quotes Mail Online's publisher, Martin Clarke, as saying the matter had been resolved \"very much to my satisfaction\". But News Corp's Australian division claimed that there had been \"a change in the practices of Mail Online since we made our complaint\". The dispute broke out in June, when News Corp sent a cease-and-desist letter to Mail Online (aka Daily Mail Australia), citing instances of its copy being reused, and alleging breach of copyright. In response, Mail Online accused News Corp papers of using its content without permission or attribution. * A Swedish website complained this week about the Sun's use of its exclusive interview with a former member of the Islamic State (Isis) without permission or attribution.
