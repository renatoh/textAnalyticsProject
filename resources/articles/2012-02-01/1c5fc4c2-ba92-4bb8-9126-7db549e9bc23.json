First came the loss to England \u2013 a Calcutta Cup kicked away and lost rather than won \u2013 and then Dan Parks surprised everyone bar the coach by retiring. That left Robinson to do a midweek mea culpa, explaining his hand in a messy business that involved first persuading the fly-half to stay on after the World Cup and then telling him he was sacked after that poor performance at Murrayfield. Add the pressures that come when four Tests go by without a Scottish try and it was easy to see why the hooded eyes at least managed a flicker when it came to assessing the play of David Denton, one of the Robinson selection gambles that did pay off. \"He had a tremendous game for us and he's going to keep on improving,\" said Robinson, seizing the moment before being forced on to the back foot again and having to give guarantees on the future of his coaching team. He should have gone on because Scotland could stand with hearing the Denton story again. How in three years the No8 from Zimbabwe with a Glaswegian mum has moved from Edinburgh University, a degree course in economics and second XV rugby with the \"Accies\" to man of the match in his first international start. With such a rate of progress it is almost surprising when the man himself admits to taking all of 10 minutes to get used to the pace of the Calcutta Cup \u2013 \"I was disappointed at not getting into the game immediately\" \u2013 but after that he made himself a real nuisance to England, either snuffing out gilt-edged try chances or setting up attacks of his own with bursts of pace that caught both team-mates and opponents on the hop. There were even those prepared to make Sunday morning predictions of a Lions place in Australia next year, something Denton had a cool head enough to put in perspective after hearing that he would be making his second start for his new country at Cardiff. It is one of those occasions where Scotland have to beat both the bookies and their own history if they are to salvage something from another Six Nations threatening to go badly wrong. \"It was bittersweet for me at the weekend,\" said Denton after training this week. \"The whole buildup to the game was incredible and making my debut was a dream. Everybody talks about it but running out of the tunnel and on to the field is something I will never forget. \"I am very grateful for the chance but, at the end of the game, all my emotions were taken down a notch. I was happy to get the man of the match award, but I made a few mistakes which, hopefully, I can iron out and, more obviously, we lost the game. \"I saw some of the stuff when people were saying about me and the Lions, but, listen, it's still very early days. I've played just one Test match, there is a long way to go and I'm quite a grounded person anyway.\" Grounded he may be, but for a player who only celebrated his 22nd birthday last Sunday, he has come a long way very quickly. The upward ascent will get a considerable boost from another good performance, especially as the Wales No8, Toby Faletau, is fast becoming a favourite for the Australia trip after a super World Cup. Denton says he knows all about Faletau and his back-row colleague Sam Warburton, having played against the Welsh captain twice this season. \"He's a good player, as is Toby Faletau. We're the same age and we played Under-20s against each other. It's going to be an interesting battle up front.\" Interesting? Denton v Faletau, Ross Rennie v Warburton and Al Strokosch versus Dan Lydiate; three mouth-watering battles in just one area of the game and Denton believes the Scots can come out on top. \"It's about shutting these guys down,\" he says in a matter-of-fact way. \"I believe we have the ability and the talent to do that. I believe that we can win. Wales have a lot of powerful players, but you have to have belief in yourself and your team-mates.\" It is said with such sincerity \u2013 and backed up by a 6ft 5in and 18st frame \u2013 that only a fool would demur. Denton, it seems, is destined to make a name for himself possibly off the field as well as on. Between the David and the Denton comes the name Kipling and the former Zimbabwean admits to researching a link with the author rather than the master baker. \"I've been doing a bit of research because it was suggested to me I should learn what it was. There is a distant relation there, but I'm still not sure exactly what it is.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
