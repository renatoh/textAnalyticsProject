If you decided to stay at home, hoping for a repeat of last year's heatwave, you're probably feeling in desperate need of some sunshine by now. Luckily there are more direct flights than ever before to winter hot spots and more hotels to choose from when you get there. So before you pack your beach towels away, see our pick of what's new for this winter. Mauritius Already home to some of the world's most luxurious resorts, November sees some exciting developments in Mauritius. The new Taj Exotica Resort &amp; Spa will have 65 villas, all with sea views, private pools and terraces, and a spa with western and Indian treatments. The five-star Voile d'Or Resort &amp; Spa will have an ultra-swish Spa with Turkish hammam and a restaurant with menus designed by Michel Roux Jr, chef patron of London's Le Gavroche. Rainbow Tours (020 7226 1004; www.rainbowtours.co.uk) offers a week's half-board at the Voile d'Or from \u00a31,095pp including transfers and flights. This price is valid for bookings made before 1 November for stays between 18 November and 14 December. Egypt Sharm El Sheikh is tipped to be a hot destination this winter in both senses of the word. The Red Sea resort is now being served by new routes from Luton, Bristol, East Midlands, Newcastle and Glasgow (to join Gatwick and Manchester) by Thomson (0870 550 2555; www.thomson.co.uk), which has launched its first dedicated Egypt brochure for this winter. Lead-in price is \u00a3269pp, B&amp;B at the Hotel Cleopatra Tsokkos, Sharm El Sheikh, departing from Luton in December. United Arab Emirates When it comes to guaranteed winter sun, the Middle East is one of the safest bets. With its sub-tropical, arid climate, you can expect sunny blue skies most of the year. Dubai already has some spectacular properties, including the sail-shaped Jumeirah and the six-star Burj Al Arab, and now the people who brought you these have finished the final phases of the sumptuous Madinat Jumeirah resort. At its heart is the opulent Al Qasr, designed like a sheikh's residence, while Dar Al Masyaf is a cluster of Arabian-style courtyard houses for hire. British Airways Holidays Prestige (0870 242 1276) offers five nights at the Dar Al Masyaf from \u00a31,243pp based on departures until 30 September, including flights, breakfast, private transfers and free UK domestic flight connections. But it's no longer just in Dubai that you'll find spectacular hotels. On 28 December, the Emirates Palace opens in Abu Dhabi; with 114 domes covered in mosaic glass tiles topped with gold finials, it's tipped to be a monument for the region on the scale of the Taj Mahal. Canary Islands You've partied in Tenerife and sunbathed in Fuerteventura, now it's time to try another, perhaps more authentic, Canary Island largely undiscovered by the British holiday pack. La Palma, known as La Isla Bonita (the beautiful island) offers visitors a scenery of lush vegetation, stunning mountains and volcanic cones and is featured for the first time in Thomson's Winter Sun brochure. The tour operator will fly direct to La Palma from Gatwick and Manchester from November. Prices start from \u00a3204pp at the Aparthotel H10 Costa Salinas for seven nights self-catering based on three adults sharing, departing 15 December. Thomson (0870 5502555; www.thomson.co.uk) Maldives As if there weren't already enough luxury resorts in the Indian Ocean, several new ones will open in time for this winter season. The Island Hideaway Spa Resort opens in December with its own marina, spa and dive centre. For the ultimate privacy, there's even a 100ft wooden yacht with five luxurious cabins for day charters or cruises. Meanwhile, at the recently opened Huvafen Fushi on beautiful North Male Atoll you can luxuriate in the world's first underwater spa. Elegant Resorts (01244 897522; www.elegantresorts.co.uk) offers seven nights at the Huvafen Fushi, including breakfast in a beach bungalow with plunge pool, flights and speedboat transfers from \u00a32,295pp, based on two sharing and departing 11 January. Miami Do Miami in style this winter at two new chic boutique hotels in the city's trendy South Beach. The Victor Hotel, managed by Hyatt, opens on 1 November next door to the Versace Mansion on Ocean Drive and will be a welcome relief for those who have tired of cool minimalism. Bold, rich colours and fabrics decorate its 91 rooms, its spa is in a cave and there's a jelly fish aquarium with disco lights (honestly). Also in November, the sister group to ultra-cool Aman Resorts opens the Setai on Collins Avenue. The Art Deco landmark will have a tropical garden, three pools and Asian-style service for its 75 guest rooms. ITC Classics (01244 355527; www.itcclassics.co.uk) offers seven nights at the Victor, room only, including flights, from \u00a31,496pp based on two people sharing. Australia Getting down under should get more affordable thanks to new flights from Virgin Atlantic (08705 747747; www.virgin.com/atlantic). The airline starts flights from Heathrow to Sydney on 7 December, adding to competition. Virgin's fares start at \u00a3839, but there are bound to be some great offers, especially now BA (0870 850 9850; www.ba.com) has launched its annual autumn sale and is selling flights for as little as \u00a3599 to Sydney and from \u00a3539 to Melbourne. BA's fares must be booked before 28 September and are valid for flights until 30 June. Caribbean With many extra direct flights (especially from Manchester), numerous new hotels and a favourable exchange rate, the Caribbean has everything going for it this winter. In St Lucia, escape from it all at the Infinity Suites which will open at Anse Chastanet Resort by December. With no telephones, radios or televisions, the focus is on open-air luxury at this resort, hidden away at the highest point of a 600-acre estate. At the new Beach House in Barbuda, butler service means you can dine any time, any place - even on its 18-mile stretch of pink and white sand. In December, Ritz Carlton opens a 366-room resort in Grand Cayman with a Greg Norman golf course and La Prairie Spa. But perhaps the most exciting event in the Caribbean is the opening of Raffles Resort Canouan Island in the Grenadines. Protected by one of the world's largest coral reefs, the three square-mile island has lots of secluded coves to explore while the hotel itself is being hailed as a haven of sophis ticated luxury. Carrier (01625 547020; www.carrier.co.uk) is offering seven nights for the price of five from \u00a31,305pp at Raffles Resort based on two people sharing a garden view room, with breakfast, flights and transfers for travel up to 12 November. North Africa You can take a short break in the winter and still get a tan thanks to new North Africa options. Little or no time difference means you won't get jetlag, and flight times are bearable too. On 2 November BA franchise GB Airways (0870 850 9850; www.ba.com) launches direct flights from Gatwick to Fez, on Fridays and Tuesdays. Return fares will start at \u00a3199. Tunisia is becoming a short break favourite too. Kuoni Travel (01306 747008; www.kuoni.co.uk) offers four nights at the Hasdrubal Thalassa and Spa Yasmine Hammamet in Tunisia from \u00a3379 per person, based on two sharing B&amp;B including flights and transfers. Thailand Thai service is among the best in the world, so if you want to spoil yourself, try one of these new resorts. In Phuket, the Trisara Resort opens on 15 October on the western coastline, the island's quietest stretch. Charter a fully crewed motor yacht, play tennis or golf or indulge yourself in the tropical spa. ITC Classics (01244 355527; www.itcclassics.co.uk) has seven nights at Trisara in a Partial Ocean View Pool Suite on a room-only basis from \u00a32,360pp, including flights and private car transfers. Alternatively, seek refuge at the new Sila Evason Hideaway in Koh Samui. Airy villas have private gardens, outdoor showers, plunge tubs and most also have infinity-edge pools. Eat Thai style on floor cushions, get holistic in the spa or watch the sun set at the bar.
