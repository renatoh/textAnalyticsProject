It may be against the trend for me to say so, but I have very little to express about the police force which could be deemed as negative. Here's an edited journey through my career, with some thoughts along the way. When I joined Greater Manchester Police on June 4 1984, I was fortunate to be posted to Bootle Street police station, which is the \"A\" division, Manchester city centre. I had high expectations of the service and its staff - I had always held the police in high esteem and considered their integrity to be without question. Throughout my career I have not been too disappointed with this view. Of course we're selected from and representative of society so will from time to time get the odd bad apple, but like society the majority are good decent people. During my time in uniform I formed good working relationships with the vast majority of my colleagues. I worked on foot patrol, progressed on to mobile patrol, worked for about 10 months on a street theft unit, which involved working in plain clothes in the city centre observing in the main car parks and the main shopping streets for thieves going about their business. I had considerable success in arresting and convicting offenders for varying crime, from possession of drugs to robbery to rape and serious assaults. An arrest of a suspect for two stabbings led to a detective sergeant asking me to consider applying for CID in 1988, which I did. I spent six months as a trainee in that department and was swamped with work. It was sink or swim and fortunately I managed the workload, keeping my head above water in the same way as many before and after me, by working unpaid overtime, ie, starting an hour early, finishing two hours late on an almost daily basis. The bottom line was if you wanted a CID career you had to pass the six-month attachment, and to pass it the workload had to be managed by the extra hours. This is still the same now, though not to the same extent. In 1990, I received my permanent posting to CID in the city. In 1992 I attended my pass or fail 10-week CID course in Birmingham. Failure of the course was very rare. I passed. During my time in the city centre CID I worked on a wide variety of jobs, including a number of murder investigations. there was always a fear of being the first detective to get in to work, as that put you at higher risk of being nominated as \"exhibit officer\" on any overnight murder. This task is often laborious, difficult, time consuming and was probably the role in a murder Investigation which had most responsibility for a constable rank. I chose to confront this fear by volunteering for the role on a murder I could see would have a speedy conclusion. I now take a similar approach to any task I can see will be difficult, because once you're familiar with a role the easier it is. Being exhibits officer on a major incident involves attending suspicious death post mortems which are a slow process through the necessity for thoroughness. I have always considered this to be one of the most unpleasant yet interesting parts of a detective's duties. I have nothing but the greatest admiration for the Home Office pathologist and mortuary staff. I've also had the good fortune to work on extradition proceedings of two men from southern Ireland who had committed a robbery at a building society in Manchester. The process - from applying for warrants, to the final appeal hearing in the Dublin courts and subsequent extradition - took around three years. Both pleaded guilty and were sentenced to eight years' imprisonment. This is an experience few in the force will have had. In August 1996 I transferred from the \"A\" division to Middleton CID, which is six miles out of the Centre of Manchester and borders the inner city divisions. Despite this, many inner city cops still consider it a sleepy hollow. Once at Middleton I was soon adopting the role of exhibit manager on the murder of a homosexual man in an outdoor cruising area. This sadly remains undetected but is currently under review following a five-year anniversary press appeal. Not long after that incident I worked on a major investigation into the practices of a male nurse at a local hospital who was suspected of poisoning patients. During this enquiry I had to make application to the coroner for warrants to exhume two bodies from the local cemetery. This coincided with the exhumations on the Shipman investigation which thankfully took a lot of media attention away from us. The warrants were granted, bodies were exhumed and toxicology tests on samples taken during the post mortems gave evidence to suggest drugs had been unlawfully administered. The male nurse was subsequently convicted of offences of administering poisons thereby endangering life - another investigation few in the force will have experienced. Following an eventual success at the police promotion examination I spent a period of time as an acting sergeant in uniform in Middleton, duties I found a refreshing change. I was eventually promoted to detective sergeant at Middleton CID and have just moved to a force unit that has responsibility in the main for investigations of the more serious categories of robbery. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time to date in the police force and would recommend this career to anyone. There are few jobs so varied, from dealing with a victim of sexual assault one day you can be investigating a commercial fraud the next. I have yet to have a boring day at work. There have been many changes over my 18 years of service. Society has certainly altered. I can recall when I first joined there would be 40-plus police officers parading for duty on a Friday night, some on overtime. The duties would be outside nightclubs and on Manchester's busier city streets. It was a regular occurrence for the locals in one night club on Oxford Street to attack the visitors to a neighbouring night club simply because they were from \"out of town\". At 2am or 3am there would be mass street brawls which we'd police with dogs, on occasions mounted patrols and specialist public order patrols seconded into the city for the weekend. Nowadays the fighting is more isolated and in my view far more violent; many assaults now result in serious and potentially fatal injuries. In my first five years of service, murders were few and far between. Now we have one or two a week in the force area. I do feel that the public expectations now are sometimes impossible to meet, and the public seem far less tolerant: the number of calls we get complaining about youths playing football and being a general nuisance is excessive. A number of these are borne of public intolerance. I think we are ridiculously underpaid for the job we do and I am sure the majority of the public would agree if they spent a week working with a police officer, uniform or detective. I do not mean a week where things are sanitised for the TV cameras. A normal week would include a lost dog, violent prisoner, distressed victim and suicide/sudden death or decomposing body. Included with this would be all the paperwork that tags on to the incidents and takes hours to complete. If politicians genuinely wanted to help the police to serve the community they should review the whole prosecution process and in that review consult constable and sergeant ranks, not the Association of Chief Police Officers (or the Police Federation for that matter). Speak to the people who do the job not the ones who talk about it. The Crown Prosecution Service should in my view work closer with the police and where possible be attached to the police stations. Management of the police force has in general been very good - I find most senior ranks approachable. I've met our chief constable, David Wilmot, three times when applying for varying authorisations and found him to be very aware of practical issues in policing. There are of course bad managers and bad cops, that should come as no surprise: it would be unrealistic to expect us, being representative of society, to be without flaw as an organisation. The police service will continue to have its strings pulled by politicians who jump on our back just before elections to secure a few extra votes. These are the same politicians who alter ways of crime recording to produce crime figures to suit their cause. I have seen very little evidence of any political party actually doing anything constructive to support the police. Margaret Thatcher was an exception but then again it suited her political cause at the time. For the future, I hope to attain the level of detective inspector or detective chief inspector; detective superintendent is probably beyond me, given that I have less than 12 years to serve and am not a graduate. I do not intend staying beyond 30 years of service as the job - though very enjoyable - is very stressful and I think anything beyond 30 years would contribute to reducing my life expectancy. No amount of money will persuade me to rethink my position. I would like to see pay increased by 30%, which would give us a fair reward for the job we do - a job that is not comparable to any other in the public sector."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
