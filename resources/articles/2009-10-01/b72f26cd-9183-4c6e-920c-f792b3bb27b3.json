The retirement of the best Flat racer since Sea-Bird \u2013 and arguably the best the turf has seen \u2013 will stir the indignation of those who think talent is a lemon that should be squeezed until the pips squeak. They will point to his brilliant surge to win the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in Paris only two Sundays ago and assert that STS, as he is known in the blogosphere, would have destroyed America's finest, just as he obliterated all-comers on this side of the Atlantic with six consecutive Group One victories from a mile to a mile and a half from spring to autumn. Are they mollycoddling him now? Is there an unseemly rush to the house of assignations to protect his stud value? Is there hell. The carpe diem argument works only if one ignores the nature-defying toughness of his schedule. Logic dictates that it should not be possible for an animal to start fast work on the gallops on 3 March and win the Arc on 4 October, without a break longer than the three weeks of reduced activity granted to this aesthetically stunning creature after his win in the Eclipse Stakes in July. When he shot from a pack of lesser beings after finding himself in an unpromising position in the Longchamp straight, Sea The Stars shifted the debate from one of stallion values and asset protection to one that emphasises the duty of care to protect a great thoroughbred. His trainer, John Oxx, has established a fine reputation for stretching the elasticity of a horse's power beyond its normal snapping point. In his deliberations, though, you could hear Oxx's cogs telling him that to ask Sea The Stars to chase the Arc and then the Breeders' Cup Classic at the Santa Anita racetrack near Los Angeles would be an affront to love and logic. In fact Oxx told the Observer in an interview that the so-called World Championships in November were being considered only as a fall-back in case a deluge produced soft ground in Paris and required his Pegasus to be withdrawn. Romance has taken a hit, certainly. Santa Anita was the scene of Seabiscuit's last win, in 1940. The Art Deco stand there in Arcadia is fragrant with old Hollywood cigar smoke and rich in tales of movie moguls who brought their cold hearts to the track in search of winners. The imagination frames Sea The Stars completing his global conquest against blue skies and the San Gabriel mountains. In the aftermath, there would have been uncontested adulation for the greatest Flat horse of all time and a triumphant homecoming to the timeless heath of the Curragh. It is not the risk of diminishing his worth as a professional gigolo that has prompted the decision not to buy the air ticket so much as a conscientious urge not to expose the horse to such extreme demands. Though he still won convincingly, there were signs of stress at Longchamp. A warm coat and overeagerness in the first third of the race were the warning signals all sensitive horse folk look for at a point in the calendar when the top National Hunt beasts are starting to disrobe for winter. In the bad old days, Derby winners would be washed down in the Epsom stables and then sent straight on blind dates that would earn their owners far more than mere prize money. The whole purpose of racing was to manufacture stallions, much as today's television is a factory of shallow fame. Sea The Stars has already had his end-of-the-line race. It was the Arc, where few winners of the 2,000 Guineas (in May) dare to tread. Those were the bookends that confirm his undeniable lustre. To win the extended sprint of the Guineas and then master all the generations over the Derby trip in the Arc is a real claim on immortality. It was beyond Mill Reef, the 1971 Derby and Arc winner, whose trainer, Ian Balding, says graciously: \"I think Sea The Stars is the best of all.\" The Sea-Bird lobby will counter-attack. They will remind us that France's most illustrious horse won the Derby on the bridle and was equally imperious in the Arc. But even the great Bird cannot match the range of Sea The Stars' achievements from eight to 12 furlongs, over half a year. Only ghosts and guessers, now, can shout for the best champions of the pre-war era. Regrets, as Sea The Stars bows out, are few. But it still hurts that he went off at 8-1 in the Guineas. Oh for a time machine and the chance to take those odds."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
