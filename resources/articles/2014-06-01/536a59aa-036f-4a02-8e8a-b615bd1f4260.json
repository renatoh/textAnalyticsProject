Both sides have now won their first three group games. Two goals from Jodie Kenny, including one from the penalty spot, and an Anna Flanagan penalty corner flick ensured the Hockeyroos took a maximum three points and maintained their perfect record at the tournament. But it was far from easy for the Hockeyroos, who welcomed back captain Madonna Blyth from injury for her first game of the tournament. \"Why make it convincing, it is far more exciting this way,\" Flanagan joked after the Hockeyroos came up with the same narrow scoreline for the third successive game. Coach Adam Commens said he believed missed chances early in the game had contributed to a tight contest later on. \"We began the game very well. First 15, 20 minutes, we had a lot of opportunities and I think, in that moment, you need to take them and score two or three goals and the match is put to bed,\" Commens said. \"We were unable to do that, which is a little frustrating as a coach. \"After that, I thought Belgium played very well. It's a team that we knew is a little tricky. \"On the flipside, I thought our ball handling was as bad as I've seen it in a number of years and we weren't good in the second half. We will need to be much better than that against the Netherlands.\" The Hockeyroos next play World Cup hosts and Olympic champions the Netherlands on Saturday night. The Kookaburras were more comfortable as they handed Belgium their first defeat. Chris Ciriello and Jacob Whetton scored in the first 10 minutes for Australia, but coach Ric Charlesworth said he was still not happy with his side's play. \"We had two lapses in the first half when we conceded two penalty corners and we fell asleep in the second half when we conceded a goal,\" he said. \"We need to address that.\" In other men's matches, England beat Malaysia 2-0 and India drew 1-1 against Spain."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
