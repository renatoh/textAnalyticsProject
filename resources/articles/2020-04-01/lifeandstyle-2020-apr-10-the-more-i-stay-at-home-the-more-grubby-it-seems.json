I\u2019d like to say it was a spiritual awakening of some sort but unfortunately it was just that my floor was really quite dirty. The more I stay home, the more grubby it seems; I notice how the wardrobes bulge and shoes languish. I balk at the use-by dates of tins forgotten on kitchen shelves, repulsed not only by their age but their texture (\u201cWhy are things in my kitchen sticky?\u201d I shamefully type into Google). No matter how hard I scrub, I find only more flaws, and no sooner is it cleaned than it all needs doing again. I am appalled, both by my dereliction of domestic duties (wasn\u2019t I raised better than this?) and for seeing it as a dereliction of duty in the first place (haven\u2019t I evolved past this?). It can mean only one thing. I am entering the next phase of modern womanhood \u2013 the long, exhausting \u201cCan\u2019t I have it all?\u201d stage \u2013 defined by wanting a life bigger than my mother\u2019s while retaining her household standards (how do her sheets always seem whiter, her food tastier?). We all end up here eventually. I have it with my mum, and she with hers. Take sewing: my mum always regretted not learning my grandmother\u2019s excellent seamstress skills (too busy moving to the other side of the world, a previously unavailable opportunity). But my mum can still mend almost anything, whereas I am ashamed I can only raise a hem and fix a button (too busy moving through my career, also a previously unavailable opportunity). Will modern womanhood always be full of such worthless comparisons? I pray someday the cycle breaks. Though I can\u2019t help but chuckle at the thought of my future daughter, wishing she\u2019d learned to fix that button, instead of having to 3D-print an entirely new coat, another previously unavailable opportunity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
