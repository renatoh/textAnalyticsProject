While it may not have Venice's romantic waterways, Luebeck has something else coursing through its cobbled streets: Christmas spirit. And every year from December 1 the Yule tide is high. The Luebeck Weinachtsmarkt has been running for well over 350 years, and these days is spread over at least five different locations throughout the city centre. Especially famous is the bazaar in the Heiligen-Geist-Hospital or Holy Spirit Hospital, at the edge of Koberg square in the centre of town. This fair is at the top end of the market, and features a range of craft stalls, selling glassware, wood carvings, puppets, pottery, bobbled knitwear and jewellery. The prices at this particular fair are the same or cheaper than you'd find in Britain, but everything is high quality and the setting in the old hospital is delightful: infinitely preferable to the world of pain that is Oxford Street - or any other high street - at this time of year. Despite wanting to keep things low-key this Christmas, I got a bit carried away and bought an exquisite little kreizel, or spinning top, carved from a single piece of wood and shaped like a teardrop, and a pair of \"pulse warmers\" which are kind of like leg-warmers for arms and make me feel like an extra from Fame, which can only be a good thing. The Heiligen-Geist-Hospital market runs for 10 days, from the Friday before the first Advent Sunday. It attracts tourists from across Germany and as far away as Scandinavia, so you may find yourself queueing to get in. If so, just grab a glass of hot mulled wine, or gluehwein, from the vendor nearby: it keeps you warm and gives you a nice sugar and spice buzz. And don't worry about it being too early for a drink; on my way down to the catacombs to look at more stalls inside the hospital, I saw several huddles of older ladies hooking enthusiastically into glasses of wine and beer - and it was about eleven in the morning. Boozing is a big part of Christmas market culture in Luebeck. At the street market in the square in front of the Rathaus, or town hall, at least half the space was taken up by food stalls selling gluehwein (with or without schnapps), jagertee (tea with rum) and beer. Oh, and tea, coffee and hot chocolate for those seeking sobriety. But strangely, I couldn't spot anyone who was: families, couples, and lone shoppers stood around sipping, blowing steam, chatting, and checking out the scene. The goods on offer in the Rathaus market were a little more my style and a lot more my price range. There was a delicious smell of pine needles, sausages, spices and roasted nuts in the air; the stalls were gorgeous to look at and there was so much variety: everything from ornaments made of straw and silver paper to flowers (roses, gerboras and lilies) and fir wreaths, more home wares, dried fruits, herbs and spices, teas, fruits and vegetables, clothing, baskets... the range was huge. And the prices were great. I stocked up on fruit teas, a huge bunch of cinnamon sticks like a small pile of kindling tied with raffia, a big bag of lavender flowers, essential oils and gluehwein mix for about \u00a315. Later on I bought a pair of slippers for less than a fiver. By this time I was feeling pretty happy; the retail therapy was working a treat and I had't spent much money at all. It was beginning to feel like Christmas. During the night of Palm Sunday in 1942 incendiary bombs were dropped on the medieval inner precinct of Luebeck, destroying nearly 1,000 houses and five of the city's seven famous church towers. Although a fifth of the town was in ruins, although mistakes were made during the reconstruction process and although it was not until the 1970s that Luebeck's citizens recognised the beauty of their Old Town, Unesco decided in 1987 to include it in its list of World Heritage sites. There is still an abundant array of rare monuments dating from various epochs, and if you can be bothered between bouts of frenzied shopping, there is plenty of beautiful Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque and neo-Classical architecture to take a peek at. Also of cultural interest is Buddenbrookshaus (in German), the former home of Thomas Mann, who won the Nobel prize for literature for his novel Buddenbrooks in 1928, and his brother Heinrich Mann who, among other things, wrote the screenplay for The Blue Angel starring Marlene Dietrich. The house, at Mengstrasse 4, was lovingly described in Thomas's novel and is now a museum. Eat I went to the Schiffergesellschaft, (seaman's guild) restaurant; a beautiful room that has housed meetings of the guild for 600 years, and continues to do so today. To be a member of the guild you need to have been born in Luebeck; Prince Charles's application was rejected on those grounds. The dining area is filled with models of ships hanging from the ceiling and other relics and frescoes decorate the walls. The food is typically German, lots of meat and potatoes, and a main course costs from DM18, or about \u00a36. Another good place to eat is the wine cellar underneath the Heiligen-Geist-Hospital, where you can tuck into the fish dishes - a regional speciality - while drinking Rotsporn, Luebeck's most famous wine (actually a French bordeaux that has been stored under water level and acquired a distinctive wood flavour). And for dessert, perhaps some rote grutze, a delicious local dessert made of strawberries, raspberries and cherries. Of course, Luebeck is also famous for its marzipan, and if you can brave the heaving crowds, you should head for Niederegger, the confectioner and cafe, which sells all manner of marzipan products. There are mounds of the stuff, but my favourites are the moulded fruit and vegetables - the kitsch factor is high, and so is the comedy. You can even venture upstairs, where there is a bizarre Madame Tussaud's-style exhibition of life-sized marzipan figures and yet another model ship, all made of almond nougat. If you are feeling inspired, it is possible to have lessons in modelling and make your very own marzipan potato. Drink If you fancy a drink that isn't gluehwein, the Bolero bar is just over the road from the Shiffergesellschaft and does a nice line in cocktails which start from about \u00a33. Also the Brauberger microbrewery on Alfstrasse does pitchers of beer that is brewed on the premises - you can even get a 10-litre jug of it if you're that way inclined. There are also a few nightclubs and discos if you're not too exhausted from all the shopping, although to be honest if you want to party hard in that way, you are in completely the wrong place. Be merry The ice rink in Luebeck opens at the beginning of December each year and a daily pass costs DM8, with the inevitable sausage-and-gluehwein stalls situated close by to ward off cold and help you forget your bruises. I also attended a variety performance at the Traveuferpalast, which I expected to be indescribably naff, but really enjoyed. A entrance ticket costs DM20, with dinner an extra DM22, and the acts are of a very high quality - I saw a fantastic soul singer, some hilarious physical comedy and some of the best static trapeze performers I have ever seen - a female double act originally hailing from Berlin called the Sputnix. And if you need a bit more help getting out and about (and you are female - a corresponding service is not offered for single men as, apparently, it might be confused with an escort service, which I am assured this is not), the Luebeck tourist office now offers something called a Szeneguide, or scene guide, which basically means you pay DM120 to a handsome fella between the ages of 20 and 35 who will then show you around town. At the moment, as far as I could make out, there are only four to choose from. Helmut was definitely my favourite, but you can choose your own through the website (see below).
