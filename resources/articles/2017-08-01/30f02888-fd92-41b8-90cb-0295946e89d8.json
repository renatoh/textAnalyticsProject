The 19-year-old, who played against Everton in the recent Europa League play-off, is set to sign for the Goodison Park club after a fee including add-ons was agreed between the two clubs. Vlasic has scored 10 goals in 85 appearances for Split since breaking into the first team three seasons ago and is a Croatia under-21 international. Everton have spent almost \u00a3150m this summer overhauling Koeman\u2019s squad but the manager remains in need of another striker plus a left-sided defender to provide cover for Leighton Baines. He has claimed that the Chelsea outcast Diego Costa would be \u201cwelcome\u201d on Merseyside but Vlasic is expected to be the club\u2019s next arrival. The Goodison club will be busy in the final days of the transfer window with Ross Barkley the subject of interest from Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur \u2013 but no bids as yet \u2013 and Kevin Mirallas, dropped for the defeat at Chelsea on Sunday because of attitude problems, wanted by his former club Olympiakos."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
