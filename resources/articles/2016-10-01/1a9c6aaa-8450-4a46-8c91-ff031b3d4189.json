But after Westwood agonisingly missed a three-foot gimme on the 18th that cost Europe a half-point, it appears the visitors will again be in need of a miracle if they hope to retain the Ryder Cup they have held since Celtic Manor in 2010. The furore about Willett, who found himself the target of the spectators\u2019 enmity on Friday thanks to his brother\u2019s midweek screed that branded American fans a \u201cbaying mob of imbeciles\u201d had thankfully subsided by Saturday afternoon and the Masters champion appeared looser on the course. He made birdies on two of the first four holes, including a beautifully struck chip in from the rough on the 2nd that rattled the pin before settling at the bottom of the cup. Westwood, the old war horse from Nottinghamshire whose 10 Ryder Cup appearances have included seven team victories, had looked completely out of sorts alongside Thomas Pieters in Friday\u2019s lopsided foursomes loss to the US Open champion, Dustin Johnson, and the Olympic bronze medallist, Matt Kuchar. Westwood pulled himself from the first day\u2019s afternoon pairings, opting to spend time on the range with his coach, Pete Cowen, with a hope of re-entering the team on day two\u2013 and for a stretch on Saturday it seemed the extra work paid off. The former world No1 rattled off three straight birdies: first on the 5th where he was matched by Holmes, then on the 6th where Moore saved the half, and finally the 7th, where he rattled home a birdie putt from 40 feet to open up a match that had been all square through the opening third. Most of the enmity that had been reserved for Willett had seemed to be transferred to Rory McIlroy, who stared down a series of hecklers on the front nine while partnering Thomas Pieters yet again to see off Brooks Koepka and Dustin Johnson and draw Europe even at 6\u00bd-6\u00bd. For the moment the visitors\u2019 comeback from 0-4 down was complete. But with the Phil Mickelson-Matt Kuchar and Patrick Reed-Jordan Spieth pairings leading their matches in progress, the pressure facing Willett and Westwood only redoubled as their match loomed as a crucial decider. Willett and Westwood never led by more than one hole throughout the afternoon and Holmes\u2019s birdie on the 13th returned the Americans to level terms. Willett left an eagle putt short on the 16th, but made the follow-up to match Holmes\u2019s birdie and save the half and the match was all square with two holes to go. Willett\u2019s sangfroid was beyond dispute after his final-day resolve at Augusta saw him become the first Englishman to win the Masters in two decades, but an untimely blink on the tricky par-three 17th set the stage for a dramatic collapse. Moore had made a sensational birdie to bail out Holmes, whose tee shot found the lake. Willett\u2019s tee shot landed on the first cut of the green near the back, but his chip landed way short and left him with a 10ft putt that he missed right. Westwood, whose putting had betrayed him, was then off target with a downhill five-footer and suddenly the Americans were in the lead for the first time all afternoon heading to the 18th. It was a gift from the Europeans \u2013 but fortunately the Americans were in the mood to reciprocate after butchering their tee shots on the final hole. Willett\u2019s misery was doubled after he dumped his tee shot into a bunker, but he responded with a magnificent pitch that landed within 12 feet of the hole. Alas, he pushed it right of the mark. That left Westwood, who had a 4ft putt for a birdie that would have split the match. But in a moment that could very well be remembered as pivotal if USA do in fact end their Ryder Cup drought on Sunday, Westwood missed. \u201cWe had our chances,\u201d a downcast Willett said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t hole the putts at the right time. There\u2019s that little bit extra pressure here. It\u2019s just a shame. The job at hand is to try and win all 12 matches tomorrow. If you look at the scoreboard, no one\u2019s at 14\u00bd yet.\u201d Only an hour earlier Europe were within touching distance of entering Sunday\u2019s singles deadlocked at 8-8. Now the Americans will lead 9\u00bd-6\u00bd going into the 12-match finale \u2013 and tantalisingly close to reclaiming the trophy on home soil."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
