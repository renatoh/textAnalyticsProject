Tottenham's Robbie Keane and Charlton's Matt Holland injured ankle ligaments and, though the immediate prognosis was that neither case was serious, their clubs will be concerned. So too might Kerr at the way Ireland's defence was breached several times by an enterprising Australia, but at the end he had plenty to celebrate. John O'Shea and Clinton Morrison secured an unlikely victory after Mark Viduka had put Australia ahead. If Ireland deserved this it was only for their refusal to give up despite falling short of their best in defence and failing to spark in attack until a late onslaught. It had been hard to see them scoring until O'Shea headed his first international goal from an Ian Harte free-kick and the Leeds defender then set up Morrison, who beat the onrushing Mark Schwarzer and saw his shot just squeeze over the line. Ireland had expected a tough game against Australia, who play too few matches to treat friendlies with anything other than full attention. An achilles injury had robbed the visitors of Harry Kewell but there had been no such last-minute withdrawals for Ireland, who started with a strong team in preparation for their next game, a crucial Euro 2004 qualifier here against Russia on September 6. As ever much was expected of Damien Duff, who was deployed at left midfield for the first time under Kerr, having previously been used in attack or behind the strikers. Yet Duff had a quiet first half during which Ireland created little and were exposed at times by a lively Australia. The early signs had been mildly promising for Ireland, with Keane a bundle of energy, making clever runs off the ball and trying to be inventive. The Spurs striker might have scored inside 10 minutes had Stephen Carr managed a better cross after bursting down the right. Yet that proved a rare opening for Ireland as Australia carved the better chances. Twice inside 60 seconds they came close, with Parma's Marco Bresciano hitting the bar from outside the area and Danny Tiatto forcing Nicky Colgan into a low save. Colgan had been chosen ahead of the Ireland No1, Shay Given, to gain more experience. If the Stockport goalkeeper was fortunate with Bresciano's beautifully struck effort, his save from Tiatto ought to have settled any nerves. The ease with which Ireland's first-choice defence was opened up during a 10-minute spell must have worried Kerr, whose team had conceded two goals in six games before this one. And it was not long before Ireland had another escape. A long punt by Mark Schwarzer caught out Kerr's back four and Tiatto should have done better than shoot wide when faced with Colgan. Gary Breen was not having the happiest of matches and Australia were finding it too easy to penetrate a midfield which lost Holland to a 19th-minute injury. Ireland's best chance arrived just before the interval. Carr and Mark Kinsella combined to put Keane through but Schwarzer saved well and it quickly became clear that Keane had been injured as Crystal Palace's Tony Popovic tried to make a saving tackle. O'Shea headed over the bar from a free-kick early in the second half but almost immediately Ireland fell behind. Not for the first time the danger came down their right, with Stan Lazaridis given too much space to cross. Andy O'Brien failed to clear and Viduka took one touch before volleying high into the net. It needed a good save by Colgan to deny Viduka a second after the Leeds striker was released by Bresciano, and the goalkeeper had to be alert to keep out the rebound. Amazingly, though, the game turned on its head, with O'Shea and Morrison the heroes. \u00b7 Claude Makelele, who is involved in a pay dispute with Real Madrid and refused to train last week, will only play for France against Switzerland tonight if coach Jacques Santini comes to an agreement with the Spanish side's sporting director Jorge Valdano.
