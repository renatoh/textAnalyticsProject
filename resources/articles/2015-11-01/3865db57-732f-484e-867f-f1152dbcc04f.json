Like many French people Lloris has suffered since last Friday but it fell to him, as the captain, to lead France in Tuesday\u2019s emotionally turbulent fixture against England at Wembley. Pochettino was at Wembley \u2013 as a guest of Roy Hodgson \u2013 and he was determined to show his solidarity, both with his players who were involved on both sides and, in broader terms, for the victims of the terrorist attacks. He lived in the French capital when he played for Paris Saint-Germain and he said that one of his friends had been outside the Stade de France last Friday, when three suicide bombers blew themselves up close to the ground. Pochettino\u2019s friend was not hurt but one passerby was killed. \u201cI didn\u2019t need to ask Hugo if he wanted to play against West Ham because when he saw me, he said: \u2018I want to play,\u2019\u201d Tottenham\u2019s manager said. \u201cIt\u2019s been very tough for him but he is strong. He is a bright guy with unbelievable personality and character. He is ready to play on Sunday and he wants to play because it\u2019s the way to pay tribute to the people. And to show the respect. \u201cIt was very difficult for him and all of the French players on Tuesday, and the English players, too. They were training at our training ground on Monday morning and you could feel that they were very sad to play. \u201cWe said that if the game went ahead, we needed to be at the stadium to give support and solidarity. It was important to show that we are not scared. I think it was a good thing to play the game to show the world how we share values. For the English fans to sing the Marseillaise before the game was very good.\u201d Pochettino said that he had texted Lloris and Morgan Schneiderlin, the France midfielder, with whom he worked at Southampton, when he heard about the attacks during the friendly against Germany and he added that he had spoken a lot to his internationals since their return to the club \u2013 not only Lloris, but his English and Belgian players. He said he is confident that all of them are in a good condition to play against West Ham and they agreed that the \u201cbest way to pay tribute to the people in Paris is to do our jobs, to play\u201d. Pochettino added: \u201cAll people are different and need different things. Some players you need to spend time with, and speak about things. But sometimes, you don\u2019t need words, you only need to hug people, to put your arm around them. You know you have to be sensitive. It\u2019s how you feel and the empathy you feel with different people.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
