Beller\u00edn was in outstanding form until early November, when the problem forced him out for five weeks, and he has not been able to recover his rhythm. At no point since his return to the team on 10 December has he played a game at more than 75% of his fitness levels. The right-back endured a torrid time in the 3-0 defeat against Palace, although he was not the only one, and when he walked over to acknowledge the travelling support at full-time he was jeered. Arsenal\u2019s defeat was damaging to their hopes of salvaging a top-four finish and before the visit to Middlesbrough on Mondaynight, Wenger talked of a downbeat mood at the club. Beller\u00edn is among the players who must emerge from the gloom. The Palace result meant that Arsenal have lost four consecutive away games in the Premier League and they have conceded three goals in each of them. \u201cWas the fans turning on Beller\u00edn unfair? I think yes, as he is a guy who is genuinely Arsenal and wants to do well,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cHe is ready to play with pain and I think it is [unfair], yes.\u201d Wenger is not exactly thrilled that Beller\u00edn is poised to feature for Spain at the European Under-21 Championship in Poland in the final two weeks of June but he accepts that the player will do so. Beller\u00edn is desperate to be involved. \u201cIt\u2019s not ideal after a long season,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cHe should have a rest and prepare for next season. The Spanish players love to play for their country and I think he will go.\u201d Beller\u00edn\u2019s ankle problem has niggled him for some time and two years ago, surgery was a consideration. At the moment, that is not under discussion. \u201cHe has not come back to his best level since he has been injured [in November],\u201d Wenger said. \u201cI think for a while he was feeling the ankle. You get bad habits and you forget that your job is, first, to defend and win challenges because you protect yourself a little bit. \u201cThen you realise you have to come back and I think now he is trying to focus again on what is important \u2013 to defend well. After, he can give us that extra bit that is important as well. I agree that, for a while, he was not the H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn we had seen at the start of the season.\u201d Wenger knows that anything less than victory at relegation-threatened Middlesbrough will intensify the sense of crisis at Arsenal \u2013 and the calls for him to depart at the end of the season, when his contract expires. \u201cI\u2019ve learned to focus on what I think I can influence and what is important,\u201d the Frenchman said. \u201cI get in a little bubble and just focus on what I think is important \u2013 and not too much what people say, even if I respect the opinions of everybody. I have to dedicate my energy to be efficient with what I do. \u201cThe fans want to be behind the team and the way we respond on the football pitch will decide the attitude of the fans. The fans love the club. It\u2019s a good period to be united and not divided. \u201cHistorically, Arsenal has been about that. There\u2019s no better period of the season to show it than now. The players are focused and they are conscious that they want to respond [to the Palace defeat]. They accept completely that we were not at the level.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
