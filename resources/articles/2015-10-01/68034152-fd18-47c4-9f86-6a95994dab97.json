Friends of Jason Goolsby, who is African American, were among those who took to streets in the city\u2019s south-east section to demonstrate against his detention on Monday evening by city officers who were responding to a call alleging suspicious activity outside a bank. Footage filmed by a friend showed Goolsby yelling and screaming as he was manhandled by two officers, who twisted his arms behind his back and placed their knees on his body to keep him on the ground. \u201cI\u2019m not resisting,\u201d he said, as one officer appeared to prepare to handcuff him. The friend, who was identified in the clip as Mike, posted the video on Twitter on Monday evening. He wrote that the pair had been \u201charassed and assaulted because \u2018someone felt uncomfortable around us\u2019 at the bank\u201d. The footage showed that Mike was also detained by officers after they ordered him to step back. Officials claimed he was \u201cinterfering with police\u201d. Neither man was officially arrested. Lieutenant Sean Conboy of the metropolitan police department said in an emailed statement that the call to police claimed that \u201cthree subjects may be trying to rob people at the ATM\u201d in the area of 6th St and Pennsylvania Ave SE. \u201cOfficers in the area responded to the assignment,\u201d said Conboy. \u201cOne individual fled on foot from the police, was chased, and then taken down. The individual resisted, and was handcuffed while resisting after he refused to stop.\u201d Conboy later confirmed that \u201cno criminal act was found to have taken place after the individuals were stopped and interviewed\u201d and said the department was \u201creviewing the circumstances surrounding the stop to ensure that policies and procedures were followed\u201d. Goolsby is understood to have graduated from Washington\u2019s Richard Wright Public Charter School for Journalism and Media Arts this year. Last December he was awarded a $1,000 college scholarship by Alpha Phi Alpha, the black fraternity whose alumni include Martin Luther King Jr and Thurgood Marshall, the first African American justice on the US supreme court. Described by his school as \u201can aspiring rapper\u201d, he has recorded music under the names Kid Kwesi and Jay Cousteau. While studying there, he recorded a tribute to Richard Wright titled My School Is So Awesome and performed the track at school events. Erika Totten, an activist who identified herself online as one of Goolsby\u2019s former teachers, described him as \u201cone of the sweetest boys I\u2019ve ever had the honor of teaching\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
