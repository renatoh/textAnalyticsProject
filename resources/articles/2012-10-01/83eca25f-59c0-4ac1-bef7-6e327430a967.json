So is Hollywood legend Julia Roberts! Gliding through a soiree of black-clad Parisian socialites, she dazzles in white. So pure, so lit-up, her expression conveys panic: \"Why am I so disproportionately blinding? Where are the ladies' loos?\" Fellow guests appear to be mere puppets with strings that shine like diamonds. Crystal chandeliers and sparkly curtains glisten, cementing the metaphor. Julia is a virtuous creature in a capitalist hellhole (or P Diddy's birthday party), and \"La Vie Est Belle\" is more than just an orangey fragrance \u2026 it's an ideology. This is a woman who has worked on the streets, fought against deadly water contamination, suffered kidney failure. While all of those examples are from films, they're all nevertheless super-relevant.

Someone dons sunglasses to deflect the glow of this matriarchal archangel, and Julia casually brushes off her own glistening constraints before making a smug exit. No one deviates from pouting and chatting for more than a nanosecond: \"Was that Julia Roberts? Did she only come for a goodie bag?\" Up the stairs she struts to the moral and literal highground of the balcony, managing somehow to resist doing air kisses. \"La Vie Est Belle,\" she declares, baring that famous smile. Life might indeed be beautiful, but remember that this star was a fan of being alive before it became oh-so-mainstream.
