Ken Macdonald, the director of public prosecutions, told the Times yesterday that defendants were walking free because of the inflexibility of the current law. He wanted the present rigid classifications replaced so that instead of dividing homicides into two - murder and manslaughter - there would be three or four different categories. This would avoid the problem with the current system, under which prosecutors opting for the more serious charge of murder can run the risk of losing the case. Who could disagree? The current law has emerged from 500 years of judge-made case law and some much more recent episodic and selective statutory changes. The result, as the Law Commission noted last year, is a mess. The commission - which comprises two judges, a senior barrister and expert sentencers - carried out consultations in which 64 respondents, including 21 judges and 43 others, described the mandatory sentence as indefensible. It is not hard to see why. The current murder charge embraces almost all known forms, from mercy killings by doctors or relatives helping family members in the last stages of painful and in curable diseases through to cold-blooded contract killers. In between, there are domestic homicides, sexual predator murders and child and serial killers. All forms of murder carry a single sentence: life. Is it any wonder that England and Wales had more life prisoners last year (5,445) than the combined total in the other 14 pre-enlargement EU states? The commission, which examined only one aspect of murder (the defence of provocation), found such \"breadth and depth of discontent\" with mandatory life sentences that it wanted a comprehensive review, the first for 50 years. Six months ago, this was promised by the home secretary. Six months on, not a single member has been appointed nor its terms of reference decided. All that was decided was that the mandatory sentence was sacrosanct. But this was under David Blunkett's rule, a regime intent on keeping judges on the tightest of reins. Charles Clarke boasts of being a more emollient and listening politician. He should make good his boasts by listening to the professionals. It will mean taking on the tabloids, which will undoubtedly make a fuss, but the commission showed there was public support for sentence differentiation. Other countries already do this. Mr Clarke should start the review and signal his support for reform."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
