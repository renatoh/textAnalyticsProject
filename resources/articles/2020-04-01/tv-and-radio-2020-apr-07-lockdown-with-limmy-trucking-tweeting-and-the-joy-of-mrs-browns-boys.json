Starting out with a series of short-form online sketches filmed largely alone in his house, Limond \u2013 aka Limmy \u2013 built a cult following hooked on his malleable face, wry observations and pitch-black humour. In 2010 he released the first season of Limmy\u2019s Show on BBC Scotland and introduced recurring characters such as the chronically paranoid stoner Dee Dee, the recovering heroin addict Jacqueline and fantasy gamer Falconhoof. Three seasons on, with three books under his belt \u2013 two short story collections and his autobiography, published in 2019 \u2013 he is returning to his housebound roots with the first full season of Limmy\u2019s Homemade Show. \u201cIt all coincidentally looks like something I\u2019ve filmed since lockdown began because it\u2019s just me and the camera, and if I do go outside, I make sure there\u2019s no one else there,\u201d he says. The result is somehow both inane and profound all at once; a repeated treatise on a kitchen game that involvs throwing a tea bag into a cup, Limond imagining his first day at an office job, a walk through an underpass, all of it underscored with pathos and absurd hilarity. Perhaps this mixture of the mundane and the serious comes from Limond\u2019s writing process. \u201cI just go about the house and see if there\u2019s any ideas around,\u201d he says. \u201cI sit in the living room and look around and think, is there anything interesting here? And then I go to the kitchen and the toilet. If I can think of something funny in there, that\u2019s a good start \u2013 I\u2019ll stick with it and see what happens.\u201d Taking observational comedy to its core of simply looking, Limond\u2019s sketches are known for deftly walking the knife\u2019s edge between tragedy and laughter, often incorporating themes of trauma, suicide and violence. \u201cWhen I\u2019m making something, I prefer it to be darker and maybe that just comes from my experiences growing up in Glasgow,\u201d he says. \u201cI like stuff that isn\u2019t particularly funny, too, just observations we drag out, or making stupid faces and then being serious again.\u201d When it comes to his own tastes, though, Limond is characteristically unpredictable. \u201cThere doesn\u2019t always have to be darkness for something to be funny,\u201d he says. \u201cTake Mrs Brown\u2019s Boys \u2013 OK, I\u2019m not sitting here waiting for it to come on, but I do like it. People criticise it because it\u2019s straightforward but it\u2019s easy to watch, it\u2019s just people smiling and laughing.\u201d For all his online posturing \u2013 building a Twitter fandom loyal to his boilerplate tweets on celebrity deaths, announcing he has met them \u201cat a charity do once and [they] were surprisingly down to earth and very funny\u201d \u2013 Limond can be surprisingly earnest. When it comes to writing, \u201cNothing is off limits in my head,\u201d he says, \u201cBut I\u2019m also very aware that I don\u2019t want to cause offence to someone who might have gone through what I\u2019m joking about.\u201d Offence in free speech can be considered like a game, Limond thinks. \u201cIt\u2019s like playing Grand Theft Auto, where you\u2019re enjoying doing horrible things to people but it\u2019s just a simulation, it\u2019s just a joke,\u201d he says. \u201cYet, you\u2019re still mimicking real life and trying to experience what it\u2019s really like, so people can see it as twisted.\u201d Go too far in this game and earnestness and mockery can become inflated, and ultimately you could get \u201ccancelled\u201d. Limond has become something of an arbiter of online cancel culture \u2013 where celebrities or members of the public get called out for past wrongdoings \u2013 although he sees it as a grey area. \u201cIt can be great to hold people to account and make them pay for doing or saying something horrific, whereas before there was fuck all,\u201d he says. \u201cBut as much as I like people getting punished for bad things, is it a life sentence for everything? How do we know when people are being genuine and really apologising too? Is there any way for them to redeem themselves?\u201d Parenting his nine-year-old son Daniel, forgiveness and redemption are topics Limond finds himself returning to. \u201cIt\u2019s scary with Daniel growing up because when I was 13 or 14, if everyone had a video camera in their pockets, most people would be fucked,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople would think that since I used to get drunk and get into trouble when I was a kid, that\u2019s all I am for the rest of my life. But people change \u2013 I have. We have to remember that we want people to get better, so we can\u2019t just come down on them and not give them a chance to get past their bad behaviour.\u201d Limond describes the teenage years he spent drinking and getting into trouble, on one occasion stealing a car, with disarming honesty in his autobiography, Surprisingly Down to Earth and Very Funny. \u201cI don\u2019t like hiding things. If I can expose the weaknesses in myself, they can\u2019t be uncovered,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t write about my life with the aim of then saying, \u2018This is how you can get better\u2019. I just wanted to get it out and it turns out that being open can be a big help in showing people they are not alone.\u201d Does he think he will avoid an online backlash now he has been so frank about his past? \u201cI think I\u2019m all right, but you just don\u2019t know when the day is coming that you get cancelled,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s coming for all of us.\u201d One thing that might help to stave off that impending doom is Limond\u2019s decision to stop writing for the foreseeable future and focus on his other passion instead: trucking. Virtual trucking that is. \u201cPlaying games is one of my favourite things to do,\u201d he says, \u201cI want to keep streaming my gaming and chatting to people online for the rest of my life.\u201d Limond is an avid player of Euro Truck Simulator 2, American Truck Simulator and Farming Simulator 19: \u201cThese games where you\u2019re not trying to complete anything, you can just drive and yap away to whoever is tuning in.\u201d Again, it\u2019s something that allows him to stay in and stay creative. \u201cI love that you\u2019re not putting on a big show, you just go live and talk about whatever comes to mind,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s my social life.\u201d Limmy\u2019s Homemade Show is on BBC Scotland at 11pm on 10 April and BBC Two at 10.45pm on 12 April"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
