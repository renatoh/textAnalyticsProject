It means, among other things, that members of the House will be able to use video conferencing to dial in remotely to parliamentary proceedings. The Lords authorities also plan to re-examine how much members receive in allowances given that they will not be expected to travel to attend the Palace of Westminster. Signed by Lord Speaker Fowler as well as the upper chamber\u2019s political leaders, the letter said they had agreed that oral statements and oral questions should be conducted online from 21 April. They said they plan to ensure that general debates and certain stages of legislation will also be held virtually at some point in the future. The letter, signed by Fowler, Labour\u2019s leader of the opposition Baroness Smith, the leader of the Liberal Democrats\u2019 in the Lords Lord Newby and the Conservatives\u2019 leader of the house Baroness Evans, said that initially, participation in virtual proceeds would be limited, with a view to expansion in the future. \u201cThe leaders, convenor and Lord Speaker have agreed that as a priority oral questions and oral statements should be, as much as possible, held virtually. A number of committees have been doing some of their work remotely over this period and that will continue once the house returns. \u201cFor fully virtual sessions, there may need to be a limit on the number being held each day to ensure Parliamentary Digital Service (PDS) resources are available, but work on this continues. \u201cWe are also working towards a position in which other types of business \u2013 general debates, certain stages of legislation \u2013 can be undertaken virtually, but we are going to have to make progress on a step-by-step basis,\u201d the letter said. Mindful that some of the chamber\u2019s older members may struggle with technology \u2013 their average age is 70, according to data from 2019 - the letter urges peers to acquaint themselves with Microsoft Teams so that they can participate. \u201cWe would strongly encourage all members to use the period before the house meets to familiarise themselves with the platform as this will be the means by which members can participate in any virtual proceedings,\u201d it said. The body overseeing the House of Lords will also re-examine how much peers receive in allowances under the new system, according to the letter. At present, they can opt to receive an allowance of \u00a3313 per day, plus travel expenses and subsidised restaurant facilities. \u201cIn view of the fact we intend a significant amount of business to be able to take place virtually, after Easter the House of Lords commission will look at how the allowances system can be adapted to reflect this new, temporary way of working,\u201d it said. One option could be for peers to be allowed to claim a half-rate, which is currently allowed for work away from Westminster. Parliament closed early for Easter as members in the Palace of Westminster sought to abide by social distancing measures to slow the spread of Covid-19. Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the House of Commons, announced last week that the government and parliament hoped that appropriate technology would be in place by 21 April, when MPs also return. It followed demands for a virtual lower chamber from the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, and opposition parties."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
