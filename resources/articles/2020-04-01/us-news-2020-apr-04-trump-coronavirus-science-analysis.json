The Imperial scientists\u2019 findings would have induced paralytic fear in all but the most nonchalant American. They likened Covid-19, which by that point had already extended its tentacles into at least 28 states in the US, to the 1918 influenza pandemic that killed 50 million people around the globe. On the basis of their modelling, they calculated that if nothing was done to halt the spread of the disease, within weeks it would infect 81% of the US population. The virus would ravage the nation, eviscerate its health system and \u2013 here came the sting \u2013 put 2.2 million Americans into body bags. We don\u2019t know at what point that bone-chilling figure was presented to Donald Trump. What we do know is that on the same day, 6 March, the president of the United States was taking a tour of the Atlanta offices of the federal disease control agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). He was in ebullient mood. He had just heard on Fox News that the latest tally of coronavirus cases in the country was 240, with 11 deaths. Trump and his favourite TV channel were as one in their interpretation of those figures \u2013 things were going great, there was really nothing to worry about. \u201cIt will end,\u201d he told the reporters trailing after him. \u201cPeople have to remain calm \u2026 All I say is: \u2018Be calm.\u2019\u201d Then a resourceful reporter asked him to set out the Trump administration\u2019s latest forecast for how coronavirus would progress in the country. He replied: \u201cWe don\u2019t have a forecast, because we don\u2019t know.\u201d \u2018One day \u2013 it\u2019s like a miracle \u2013 it will disappear\u2019 Trump\u2019s answer was one of the few candid moments over the past three months of his handling of the coronavirus crisis. It was true that they didn\u2019t know. That in a real sense they were walking blind. Already by 6 March the absence of effective diagnostic testing \u2013 caused in part by the CDC\u2019s botched rollout of its own Covid-19 test \u2013 was severely hampering efforts to track the spread of the disease in the hope of containing it before it overwhelmed the country. \u201cAnybody that needs a test gets a test,\u201d Trump told the gaggle of reporters in Atlanta. \u201cThey have the tests. And the tests are beautiful.\u201d The tests were not beautiful, they were critically flawed. Anybody who needed them was not getting them. With virtually no testing available to inform public conversation, Trump was free to unleash his \u201cnatural ability\u201d on the problem, which he did with abandon throughout the early weeks of the crisis. Trump took to describing himself as a \u201cwartime president\u201d, with Covid-19 as the enemy. But his dogged pursuit of his own instincts, his preference for letting his \u201chunches\u201d lead the nation into battle rather than deploying the weaponry of evidence and science, has been the hallmark of his response to the contagion so far. From the first confirmed US case in Washington state on 20 January to Trump\u2019s citing of Imperial\u2019s 2.2 million projected deaths which he did for the first time just this week, he has kept up a relentlessly upbeat facade, downplaying the severity of the threat largely for the benefit of the New York stock exchange. \u201cWe have it totally under control,\u201d he said two days after that first confirmed case and a day before China cut off Wuhan, a city of 11 million. \u201cWe only have five people, we pretty much shut it down coming from China,\u201d he said on 30 January, the day the World Health Organization declared a global emergency. \u201cIt\u2019s going to disappear. One day \u2013 it\u2019s like a miracle \u2013 it will disappear,\u201d he said on 27 February, the day America mourned its first coronavirus death. Trump\u2019s \u2018hunches\u2019 versus science On Tuesday he finally switched tone. The country was in for a \u201cvery, very painful two weeks\u201d, he said, and every American had to be prepared \u201cfor the hard days that lie ahead\u201d. By then the bitter truth could no longer be avoided. With stringent social distancing, the Imperial\u2019s 2.2m body bags could be reduced, but by the reckoning even of Trump\u2019s own advisers between 100,000 and 240,000 Americans are still likely to die. Trump now has on his watch a public health disaster of devastating proportions. Some 245,573 cases have been confirmed across the states, twice the number in Italy, the second-highest nation in the Johns Hopkins league table. More than 6,000 people have died and the curve is still rising exponentially. Covid-19 is overwhelming hospitals in New York, New Orleans, Detroit and is hurtling towards the Trump-supporting heartlands. The federal stockpile of essential medical equipment is nearly empty. Ventilators and protective gear for frontline medical staff are running fatally low. Doctors are improvising masks to save their own lives out of plastic bags and rubber bands. Even diagnostic testing, the most critical hope for getting on top of the disease, remains hard to get because of shortages in swabs and vials leaving emergency coordinators still \u2013 three months into the crisis \u2013 in the dark. It is a catastrophe that many scientists and public health emergency experts believe could substantially have been averted, if only Trump had listened. \u201cThis will be regarded as the worst public health disaster in America in a century,\u201d said Eric Topol, professor of molecular medicine at Scripps Research in San Diego. \u201cThe root cause of the disaster was the lack of readiness to understand where, how and when the disease was spreading.\u201d Jeremy Konyndyk, a senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development who led the US government\u2019s response to international disasters between 2013 and 2017, said that stark contrasts in outcomes between different countries in terms of illness and death have been determined not by Covid-19 itself, but by how seriously each government took the risk and how early they acted. \u201cOn that score we failed badly,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can have the best system in the world, but if you give the virus an eight-week head start it will eat you alive.\u201d For Naomi Oreskes, a history of science professor at Harvard, the unfolding calamity is the fulfilment of her worst fears. \u201cWhen we first heard about coronavirus, I and several of my colleagues worried that Trump would not attend to scientific advice. This is a man who has exhibited a reckless disregard for scientific evidence over climate change; if he could do that, there was always the question of whether he would take seriously any science.\u201d Oreskes sees Covid-19 as Trump\u2019s ultimate challenge. Would he put the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans first, or would he dig into the tried-and-tested Republican playbook of showing hostility to science and expertise, reining in government intervention and prioritizing the money markets? \u201cThis was a test of whether Trump\u2019s government would act. What we\u2019ve seen is that for the people in power in this country, ideology beats even an imminent threat.\u201d \u2018As the president fiddles, people are dying\u2019 Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in Congress, took the extraordinary step on Sunday of accusing Trump directly of \u201ccosting American lives\u201d. His lessening of the severity of the virus early on \u201cwas deadly\u201d, she told CNN, as will be the delays in delivering medical equipment to where it is needed. \u201cAs the president fiddles, people are dying,\u201d she said. That was a tough accusation, even by the standards of these hyper-partisan times. But a growing number of scientists and health emergency experts are tentatively drawing the same conclusion. \u201cWe now know there will be well over 100,000 deaths,\u201d Topol said. \u201cA vast majority of those will have been unnecessarily lost because of the lack of preparedness of the United States. As a leader, Trump has to accept responsibility, which of course he won\u2019t.\u201d It is not as though Trump wasn\u2019t warned. In the wake of the Ebola epidemic in 2014, the Obama administration was so fearful of the dangers of another epidemic that they put in place several innovations designed to prepare the nation for a pandemic. Konyndyk, who was central to the Ebola response, has watched aghast as every element of that effort has been unpicked or overlooked by the Trump administration. \u201cWe set up a special team for pandemic preparedness at the national security council \u2013 they dismantled that. We left them a very detailed playbook of the initial steps for managing an event like this \u2013 they ignored that.\u201d \u2018Scientists knew the risk \u2013 urgent action was needed\u2019 When coronavirus reared its ugly head, there was plenty of early warning. Alex Azar, the health and human services secretary, became aware of the outbreak of a virus in China as early as 3 January. By 5 January scientists in Shanghai had obtained a complete viral genome from an infected patient and reported it immediately to GenBank, the genetic sequencing database of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH). By early February, scientists were aware that Covid-19 was both easily transmitted between individuals and had a relatively high fatality rate, especially for older and vulnerable people. \u201cThat was enough for scientists to know the virus had the potential to spread far and wide and that urgent action was needed,\u201d Konyndyk said. At the same time, US intelligence agencies were passing on their own warnings to the White House. According to the Washington Post, Azar tried several times to sound the alarm but couldn\u2019t get an audience with Trump until 18 January, at which point all the president wanted to talk about was vaping. The Post quoted an anonymous US official who said the system was \u201cblinking red\u201d. The official said: \u201cDonald Trump may not have been expecting this, but a lot of other people in the government were \u2013 they just couldn\u2019t get him to do anything about it.\u201d With the full might of the US scientific community at his disposal, Trump appointed individuals not known for their prowess with pandemics in charge of the federal response. The coronavirus taskforce was to be led by the vice-president, Mike Pence, who has been widely criticized for his handling of a 2015 HIV outbreak when governor of Indiana. Trump is also increasingly relying on his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who made his first appearance at the taskforce briefing on Thursday. Politico has reported that Kushner, whose skill set is in real estate, has in turn reached out to his brother\u2019s father-in-law, who is at least a physician, for advice on fighting the pandemic. \u2018Trump was out of step with all the experts\u2019 Trump\u2019s failure to heed the warnings and act quickly has set in train a domino effect that now imperils large swathes of the US. What began as an inability to get diagnostic testing going on a mass scale has developed into a sluggish mobilization of the federal government, a stuttering deployment of the Defense Production Act to enlist the firepower of corporations, and a stand-back, almost detached approach that has allowed state governors to take the lead in what Konyndyk called the birth of \u201c50-state anarchy\u201d. One of the few proactive measures taken by Trump was to impose a partial travel ban on China and Europe. Scientists told him the move would only delay the advance of Covid-19 in the US, it could never stop it. Again, he didn\u2019t listen. \u201cTrump thought in terms of a wall. Put a wall around China and the virus won\u2019t come to the US. He was out of step with all the experts around him,\u201d Topol said. As a result, the US lost the early potential to contain the virus, either by locking down hotspots as China did with Hubei province or through aggressive testing to isolate those infected as South Korea has done. Tomas Pueyo, a Stanford-trained consultant based in California, has laid out in sobering detail how quickly the disaster is laying waste to the US. His first exploration of the subject, a data-driven plea to take the disease seriously posted on Medium in early March, received 40m views. On Wednesday he published his updated research. It shows America\u2019s curve of confirmed cases rising more steeply than that of any other country in the world. Three weeks ago, Pueyo reminds us, the US had fewer than 1,000 confirmed cases at a time when Trump was telling the world: \u201cNo, I\u2019m not concerned at all. No, I\u2019m not. No, we\u2019ve done a great job.\u201d Now it stands at almost a quarter of a million. \u201cThis is what exponential growth looks like,\u201d he said. Having hit the Democratic-controlled high-density urban centers first \u2013 San Francisco and Seattle, then New York and New Jersey, now Detroit \u2013 the virus is marching inexorably in the direction of the more rural southern and heartland states that happen to form the crucible of Trump\u2019s base. Many of those states followed the lead set by Trump and Fox News, remaining relaxed about the threat and moving astonishingly slowly to put physical distancing controls in place. Florida, under its Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, has echoed Trump\u2019s approach and only imposed a statewide stay-at-home order on Friday despite having the sixth-largest tally of confirmed cases in the country. Georgia and Mississippi followed suit. Some Republican states including Oklahoma and South Carolina still have no statewide mandatory stay-at-home orders. Pueyo points out that Republican voters are additionally vulnerable as they have a higher age profile than Democratic voters. Coronavirus makes no distinctions as to party, but it does prey on the elderly. So it is one of the great paradoxes of Trump\u2019s pandemic that he may have put many of his own loyal supporters in mortal peril. As Konyndyk put it: \u201cTrump has endangered his own supporters by sending out a message in contradiction to the science, and they believed him.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
