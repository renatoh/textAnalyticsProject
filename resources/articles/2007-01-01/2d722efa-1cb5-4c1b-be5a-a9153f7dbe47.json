Jonathan Freedland's excellent piece in today's Guardian made me revisit it; it is rather depressing to contemplate whether this Middle East conflict has learnt anything, as it should have, from the past \"transformation of the IRA\". Now elected, Hamas, for the first time, has a real opportunity to be involved in planning a road map for a trip it wishes to take. But to get to the roadside, there is a river of mistrust to cross which requires it to take numerous confidence-building stepping-stones. If they are looking for fellow travellers to learn a trick or two from in the art of such crossings, then they need look no further than Sinn Fein and the IRA. Democracy's leap of faith has reaped a grand reward for Hamas as it did for their Irish brothers. But with electoral success comes the burden of responsibility. Part of that responsibility is to foster peace, which inevitably means respecting its neighbours, adhering to the law and righting wrongs. Hamas is a designated terrorist group because, among other things, it indiscriminately murders innocent civilians to achieve its ends. Such action is a breach of international law and justifies UN condemnation. Hamas cannot expect anyone in the international community to ignore this and come running to congratulate them for its adherence to democracy. Hamas may have won a fair democratic election but that merely lends force to the legal argument that Hamas should no longer be on the list of foreign terrorist organisations but now be on the list of state sponsors of terrorism, along with Libya, Syria, and Iran et al. It would follow that it would be illegal under international law to pass humanitarian aid to the Palestinians through a terrorist group/state. As an ephemeral terrorist organisation, they could and did ignore such legal constraints, but as an elected government, they are now an entity that is not impervious to sanction. Sinn Fein can attest to the penalties it has paid for the wayward actions of the IRA. It took many years before the British government took over from the spooks and sat down with representatives of the IRA, as well as Sinn Fein; even longer before the unionists joined them. Israel looks like the Protestant majority in Northern Ireland with a populist leader saying, \"Never, never, never\". Israel is right to take the public position it has at this stage but, pragmatically, it must look to dialogue. In every peace process, there is a natural time to talk following concessions and confidence-building measures. The lesson is that even though you say never, you must never mean it. The giant leap demanded by Israel - that Hamas dismantle the terrorist organisation - is unrealistic and counterproductive. It must be a goal down the line, but in the early stages, it must not become an obstacle to peace. Instead, we should foster the Irish model of stepping-stones towards engagement and then peace talks concerning the real underlying issues. So we have a terrorist organisation, or state, that international ethos, law and practice say both that we should and should not deal with. A dilemma for the international community, yes, but also a problem for Hamas - and one they must begin to solve themselves. The first step by Hamas must be one of self-preservation and astute politics. Hamas must do more visibly to separate its political wing from its military one. The current divisions are barely credible to the international community. Hamas must begin to play the Irish model of ballot box and Armalite politics until it reaches a position where - down the line - its grassroots militants are happy to disarm and stand down. That Hamas is attuned to this is evidenced by the fact they campaigned in the name of \"Resistance and Reform\". Likewise, their candidates included moderates and hardliners: moderates to be an interim bridge for potential dialogue, and hardliners such as Jamal Abu al-Hija, the Hamas military commander for Samaria. The second step must be a concession to Israel. Hamas's aims, highlighted within its election campaign, are expressed clearly within its constitution - the Covenant of the Islamic Resistance Movement of August 18 1988. It states that the sole purpose of Hamas is to eradicate Israel and to form an Islamic state in its place. In doing so, Jews and Christians do not necessarily have to be exterminated as Article 31 very generously allows them to coexist, but only \"under the wing of Islam\". It reads like the IRA's fascistic Green Book, which frowned on a member marrying or fraternising with a Protestant. This is the same Green Book that - when the peace process advanced - the IRA was only too keen to throw aside as an anachronism. Article 22 will be equally embarrassing to Hamas: \"They [the Jews] were behind World War I ... they ... instigated the ... Security Council to enable them to rule the world ... There is no war going on anywhere without them having their finger in it.\" They would do well to erase such rhetoric - so why not do it for early political gain in the peace process. The third step needs to be taken by the international community to reward Hamas for its modernisation. International officials should publicly meet with Hamas political moderates. The credibility this would give Hamas moderates within their own community would enable them to take the next stepping-stone. The cost to the international community would be offset if it then took the credit for fostering Hamas's next step. Learning from the Irish republican paramilitaries, step four could require Hamas to stop targeting civilians (which would leave open the question of Israeli security personnel). The IRA, as the peace process progressed, moved from the position of targeting innocents, to bombing financial targets, to \"policing\" nationalist communities. This gradual shift enabled the IRA to keep control over the hardliners and thus maintain its authority at the table. The effect of this change in Hamas' policy would be that Hamas would stop breaking international law (which is ambiguous on the targeting of security personnel) and therefore become less unacceptable to right-thinking governments. This kind of partial peace could create a prevailing mood for providing the next return move of compromise, thus rewarding the Hamas hardliners for their step down the road to political normalisation. However distasteful it is to distinguish between civilians and non-civilians, hardliners must be given a safety valve if they, along with the rest, are to endure the inevitable ups and downs of a process. A small jump to the next stepping-stone is always achievable, whereas giant leaps usually mean someone gets wet. As a precursor to Palestinian-Israeli talks, Hamas must declare a total ceasefire, this time including security personnel, which should hold long enough to make Israel comfortable. Israel would then be free to sit down and carry out meaningful dialogue on the back of real concessions. Israel might foster this move by halting provocative incursions into the Palestinian Territory and facilitating humanitarian efforts (which, at this stage, would be legal) through the Palestinian government. Moves along these lines may not only be a long-deserved relief for the innocent civilians of Israel but also be palatable to Hamas hardliners as well as the Israeli government. For Israel, too, is a democracy, a democracy in which many voters have suffered as a result of Hamas. An Israeli government would find it difficult to reject solid gestures that seek to jettison hackneyed rhetoric and bring about a relative peace for a populace which has unjustly suffered."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
