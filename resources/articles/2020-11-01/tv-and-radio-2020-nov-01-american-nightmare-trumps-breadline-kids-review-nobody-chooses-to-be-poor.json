That is bad enough, but American Nightmare: Trump\u2019s Breadline Kids (Channel 4) could not be timelier. That is true on his side of the Atlantic and on ours, as the airwaves of this septic isle fill with the sound of elected officials asserting that, for good moral and economic reasons, hungry children should not be fed via the public purse. This latest instalment of the ever-reliable Dispatches series was recorded in Ohio over four months that took in the arrival of Covid-19 and the Black Lives Matter protests that spread across the US after the killing of George Floyd. It follows the stories of five young people, representing different facets of poverty. Kyah, 14, and her sister Kelia, 18, along with their mother, Becky, are part of the hidden homeless population. They have been sofa surfing with friends and relatives since Covid-19 hit the job Becky was about to start and left the family without an income. Unable to pay rent, they lost their home and then, as they waited for emergency benefits to come through, their possessions. The storage facility auctioned them off to cover the fees they could not pay on time. \u201cNobody chooses to be poor,\u201d explains Kyah. \u201cSometimes it can look like that because they give up and accept it, but I don\u2019t think nobody would choose to live this way.\u201d The family are sharing one room at a friend\u2019s house. Illness pulled the rug from under the feet of 13-year-old Shawn\u2019s family. He, his mother, Crystal, and his baby sister, Dior, have been living in a tiny trailer since his mother was diagnosed with a kidney disease and, for the first time in her life, had to stop working. The lack of space means his 15-year-old brother, Edward, lives with their grandmother. They live on $400 (\u00a3310) of food stamps and $485 in other benefits a month. Crystal works 80 hours a month at the local Salvation Army food bank to qualify for the latter (despite being too ill to work) and Covid-19 food shortages have halved the purchasing power of the former. Raised by a father who was a member of the KKK, she takes her mixed-race sons to BLM protests \u201cso that they know what it feels like to come together\u201d. She remembers the time their grandfather burned a cross on the front lawn as the worst moment of her life. Working-family poverty is embodied by 12-year-old Laikyen. She and her sister are, of necessity, mostly left to fend for themselves during school-free lockdown, while their mother works all hours at the local petrol station. They survive thanks to the fact that they own their home (bought with a $10,000 loan taken out in better days) and receive parcels from the local food bank. There, Laikyen \u2013 who has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and was held back in kindergarten (\u201cBecause I was not smart\u201d) \u2013 has her beloved \u201cMiss Candy\u201d, who sits with her and tries to create an oasis of calm in the child\u2019s life to enable her to pay attention to schoolwork. \u201cWe\u2019re going to get that \u2018D\u2019 up!\u201d she assures the distressed Laikyen. \u201cI don\u2019t care!\u201d she replies. \u201cYou do care,\u201d says Miss Candy. \u201cI care. It\u2019s just a lot on you right now.\u201d On it goes, illustrating deftly in an hour the innumerable life chances already absent from these children\u2019s lives before more were stolen by the pandemic, by the president, by the lack of a sufficient safety net for people who fall. Worst of all, it is a bagatelle. These children are not the worst off. They are not long-term, \u201cfully\u201d homeless. They still have a cigarette paper or two separating them from the abyss. They have not been separated from their parents and caged. Within the ever-widening pool of people harmed by Trump, his enablers and his most venal supporters, they are among the luckier ones. The documentary comes, of course, just before the US election. Let\u2019s hope for a better tomorrow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
