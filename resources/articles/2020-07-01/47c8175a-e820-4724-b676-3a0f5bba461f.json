The cross party committee said the pandemic had revealed that 70% of the active ingredients used in pharmaceuticals in the UK are made in China \u2013 while India manufactured \u201cvirtually all\u201d the paracetamol in British shops. Drug supplies had held up during the first wave of the pandemic despite interruptions to the supply chains, helped partly by stockpiles of medicines lasting anywhere between three to six months. The committee told ministers \u201cthey must work with the pharmaceutical industry to ensure that buffer stock is being replenished to help cope with any further wave\u201d \u2013 warning that supply chains \u201ccan only be stretched so far\u201d in the future. At the height of the UK pandemic crisis in April, when paracetamol was in short supply in shops, India announced it was restricting drug exports. Ministers had to negotiate with the Indian government to secure 2.8m packets of the pain killer. Experts told the committee that Chinese suppliers dominate the production of active ingredients, turning them over to Indian manufacturers who turn them into pills with the addition of filler compounds. China shut down its supply in January and February, only for India to shut down its manufacturing and restrict exports. The MPs called on ministers \u201cto be as open as possible\u201d as to how they are dealing with \u201csupply chain resilience arising from the pandemic\u201d and in particular \u201chow it will balance national security with its ambition to be a global champion of free trade\u201d. The government is currently engaged in a review \u2013 entitled Project Defend \u2013 launched after the pandemic crisis eased to examine how dependent the UK was on China, India and elsewhere for critical goods. Anxiety about China and Chinese suppliers has also been rising across government, prompting the announcement earlier this month of a total ban on Huawei 5G equipment in future mobile phone networks from 2027. The committee complained that details about Project Defend were limited, and said that Liz Truss, the trade secretary, appeared to be \u201cthe first and so far only member of the government\u201d to publicly discuss the review when she gave evidence to the committee in June. But even at the time Truss said she could not reveal very much: \u201cI cannot go into the details of Project Defend, for obvious security reasons, but making sure we have a proper supply of those drugs for this country is very much our focus and the focus of the Department of Health,\u201d the minister told MPs. Committee members urged ministers to concentrate on the development of \u201cparallel supply chains\u201d as a solution, to ensure that the UK would have an uninterrupted supply of paracetamols and other generic drugs in future pandemics. That would involve having British companies supplying 20-30% of the market with the ability to have \u201ca degree of \u2018surge capacity\u201d allowing them to step up production to 90% if a similar crisis occurred again. Angus Brendan MacNeil, the chair of the committee, said: \u201cThe question now facing trade policymakers is not only how to help economies respond to the damage caused by Covid-19 but also how to better prepare for a similarly dire scenario in the future.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
