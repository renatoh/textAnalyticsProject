But beneath the shuddering use of words like \u201cquarantine\u201d lives a solid, slithering little B-movie, one that openly cribs from the blueprints of Alien and The Thing but does so with just about enough skill to warrant a midnight viewing, if not quite enough to justify itself at any other time of the day. It\u2019s the first feature film by the TV director Neasa Hardiman, who\u2019s amassed an impressive set of credits on both sides of the Atlantic with everything from Happy Valley to Inhumans, a broad range of experience that gives her debut an accomplished smoothness. Her accompanying script is bit choppier, though, especially at the outset as we meet Siobh\u00e1n (Hermione Corfield), an Irish marine biology student who tells us exactly who she is rather than letting us find out. Within the space of a few minutes, \u201cI don\u2019t do joining in!\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m a good observer!\u201d and \u201cI need my own space!\u201d are enough to clumsily tell us that she\u2019s not exactly a fan of others, something that\u2019s about to be put to the test with a week spent on a scrappy fishing trawler. Her presence isn\u2019t exactly welcomed by the crew either, whose superstitions over her red hair have them expecting the worst for their trip out to sea. But fears over an underwhelming haul of fish are soon replaced with something far greater as the boat encounters an otherworldly entity that starts infecting the crew. The infection is a grim one, parasitic in nature, manifesting itself in variously nasty ways (anyone with sensitivity over eye horror had best, ahem, look away). Siobh\u00e1n must use her scientific intellect to figure out how best to survive. It\u2019s an age-old battle between human and nature as well as brain and brawn and while the two aforementioned classics definitely leave their mark (a testing scene is ripped directly from The Thing, and later, The Faculty), Sea Fever feels most closely aligned to 2017\u2019s far superior monster movie Life. Both lay an intriguing amount of blame on the human invaders, both justify the creature\u2019s quest as born out of a bid for survival rather than malice and both lead into a wider discussion of saving a group of lives versus risking thousands more. These are interesting issues to raise in a film such as this, but Hardiman rushes through her 89-minute debut a little too fast, and as a result the plotting and atmosphere suffer. It\u2019s never quite as squirmy or claustrophobic as I\u2019d hoped, despite the setting and the ickiness of the premise. While Hardiman does manage a handful of effectively nasty moments, they\u2019re isolated rather than part of an incremental progression. As she enters the final act, her creaky boat threatens to capsize. It\u2019s kept just above water by an adept cast, led by a terse and practical Corfield as well as the experienced duo of Dougray Scott and Connie Nielsen, who anchor the silliness, despite the latter\u2019s bewildering attempt at an Irish accent. It\u2019s a low-budget effort with high ambitions, something that\u2019s hard not to admire, and while it often feels like the teaser for a bigger and better movie, it\u2019s perhaps a sign that Hardiman is setting sail for Hollywood next. Sea Fever is available to stream in the US on 10 April and in the UK on 24 April"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
