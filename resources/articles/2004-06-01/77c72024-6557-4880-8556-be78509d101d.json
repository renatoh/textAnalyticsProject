Neither the independents nor the broadcasters had won. Both lost. On the face of it, it did look as if the independents had won. In place of the few discontented film makers and TV programme makers who had given birth to the idea of the independent sector in 1968, by 2000 independent producers made and sold \u00a31,000m worth of programmes. That represented more than 20% of all the programmes shown on every British channel and over 10,000 hours of programmes sold to UK TV every year. Some former campaigners even headed the broadcasting organisations they had once challenged. Independents were successfully floating their companies on the stock exchange, expanding overseas or being bought out by international media conglomerates and UK broadcasters, and becoming millionaires. What was once \"a radical idea on the margin\" had become \"mainstream\". If the aim of the leading protagonists in the independents' successive struggles had been to advance their own careers and get rich, many must have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. But had that been their aim? It was not what they claimed at the time. They said they wanted to bring freer television to Britain; to provide the opportunity to make more adventurous programmes; to open up television to the expression of a range of ideas, tastes and styles which were excluded; to make entry into the medium open to people from all backgrounds; to free the television organisations from a combination of stifling bureaucracy, trade union restrictive practices, pompous self-aggrandisement and rampant greed. Measured against these aims, their success has to be judged as at best partial and at worst counter-productive. It is undeniable that the campaigners had real successes and can claim some lasting achievements. They were the catalyst in ridding the production process of over-manning and restrictive practices and opening up television to new entrants. They played a vital role in wresting the second commercial channel from ITV and bringing about the publisher-broadcaster Channel 4. But do we really have better television than in 1968? On all channels there has been a relentless burgeoning of so-called \"reality shows\". Coverage of foreign stories has almost disappeared from current affairs on ITV and largely migrated from BBC1 to BBC2. One still sometimes finds excellent factual series, such as Laurence Rees's The Nazis - A Warning From History, from the BBC in 1999 and Adam Curtis's Century of the Self in 2002. However, the single creative documentary in the tradition of Humphrey Jennings is once more an endangered species (Paul Watson's brilliant study of the effects of Alzheimer's disease in Malcolm and Barbara, A Love Story in 1997, was the exception to prove the rule). To get made documentaries have become ever more dependent on international co-production money, thus further undermining the genre as a mode of creative interpretation of British society for British audiences. ITV's drama, which once boasted Armchair Theatre, Brideshead Revisited and The Jewel In The Crown, is almost restricted to soap operas, thrillers, doctors and the emergency services. In 2002 BBC Television's output of single dramas and films fell to just 14 single dramas - eight feature films and six TV films. What has happened is a prime example of TV's \"commodification\". The result, as David Hare put it in a 2002 Hay Festival lecture, has been to rob us of \"the most important new indigenous art form of the 20th century\". Even some of the architects of today's broadcasting have doubts about what they did. Lord Griffiths of Fforestfach (who as Professor Brian Griffiths was head of Margaret Thatcher's Number 10 policy unit in the 1980s) said to me: \"If you ask me 'is television today better than it was in the 1980s?' I have to say 'no'.\" He and his colleagues had been \"too optimistic about how the broadcasters would behave if given greater freedom in the Broadcasting Act\". The government spelled out its broadcasting priorities in last year's Communications Act: \"First, we will make the UK home to the most dynamic and competitive communications and media market in the world.\" Public service broadcasting, the quality and diversity of programmes available to the public except as an assumed adjunct or consequence of competition, came well down its list of priorities. Broadcasting policy seems driven by myths. One is that the proliferation of channels and need for programmes to fill them will provide a great bonus for the UK's balance of trade. The truth, however, is that as content regulation has relaxed and channels have proliferated, we have gone heavily into the red. A graphic example is programming for children. Since the 1960s the volume of programmes for children and young people has multiplied. However the proportion of imported youth programmes shown on ITV has multiplied tenfold. On non-terrestrial channels, other than those of the BBC, almost 90% of the programmes are imported. Ofcom is reviewing public service broadcasting and its conclusions will be considered by the government in deciding about the BBC charter after 2006. Its chief executive, Stephen Carter, is dissatisfied with the nebulous definitions of what constitutes public service broadcasting since the BBC was founded with the duty to \"inform, educate and entertain.\" I believe that if our television is to be saved from the fate that befell once proud broadcasting traditions, such as those in Canada or Australia, all who care about its quality need to mount a new struggle, aimed not simply at restoring our television to the prestige it once enjoyed, but to lift it to new heights and enable it to achieve its full potential. Here are a few of the things that might figure among its objectives: The prime goal of broadcasting policy must be to sustain, enhance and extend the health of public service broadcasting to maximise its value in the cultural, social and political life of the country and of all its citizens. The independence of the BBC must be guaranteed. However, the appointment of BBC governors should be made more open and governors' duties must not be taken over by Ofcom. It is important for the health of our democracy that there remain two separate systems of broadcasting regulation. The BBC licence fee must be retained, and no element of subscription or advertising revenue introduced. However, means should be found to equate it to ability to pay. ITV, Channel 4 and Channel Five and all other broadcasters must be subject to full public service regulation and the regulator given the requisite powers to undertake this. These powers must include the regulatory authority having a duty to award licences on the basis of quality of service rather than the amount an applicant pays for a licence. It is more than 25 years since there has been a full inquiry into broadcasting as a whole. Rather than more limited investigations into discrete areas of broadcasting, such as those undertaken by the Peacock committee or the government \"consultations\" carried out since, we need a full inquiry or Royal Commission into all aspects of broadcasting, similar to those carried out by the Pilkington and Annan committees. Ofcom could not oversee such an inquiry as it would be one of the institutions being scrutinised. The 25% independent production quota must be reviewed to determine if it still serves any creative or cultural purpose. If not it should be phased out. If a quota is retained it should apply only to programmes produced by UK companies, excluding subsidiaries of UK, EU or foreign broadcasters, or companies owned or controlled by any such broadcaster. The blurring around the edges of the independent quota, of who qualifies and who does not, of which programmes count - indeed, the purpose of having an independent quota at all - has reached the point of confusion. In 1987, at Mrs Thatcher's Downing Street seminar on broadcasting, I told her that the 25% quota was needed as \"a runway of opportunity\" so that the independents could \"get airborne\" to compete with the broadcasters. After that, I said, it would not be needed. That runway has now served its purpose. Today the benefits of having a protective quota for independent producers may be outweighed by its disadvantages for the health of broadcasting. Independent producers, dependent on the sale of their programmes and format rights, tend to increase the pressure to commodify creativity, talent and programmes. \u00b7 This is an edited extract from Michael Darlow's book, Independents Struggle - The Programme Makers Who Took On The TV Establishment, published on Wednesday by Quartet Books, \u00a316"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
