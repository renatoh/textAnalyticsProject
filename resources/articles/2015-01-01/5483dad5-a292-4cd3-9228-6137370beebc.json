Donovan said he will not comment further until Republican caucuses begin the candidate selection process to replace Michael Grimm, who announced his resignation in December after pleading guilty to tax evasion. Donovan led a grand jury investigation into New York police officer Daniel Pantaleo, who held Garner in a chokehold that led to his death over the summer. Garner was allegedly selling untaxed cigarettes, an offense for which officers attempted to arrest him. The encounter between police and Garner was caught on camera. His death led to months of protests against police across the city. The grand jury declined to indict Pantaleo, and no charges have been brought against the other officers involved in his death."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
