What should I do? Name withheld, by email Not a blessed thing, Mr Withheld. Bless you, my poor boy, I can feel your pain, but one cannot fight against God's plan. No tilting at windmills round here, no sirree Bob. Gosh darn it, what will be will darn well tooting be, as me and Mrs Hockey Mom and Plumber Joe always say. Oh my, apologies people: we seem to have a bit of interference in reception and the column has been taken over by the spirit of some strange Alaskan apparition who, sources say, is actually Dick Cheney's avatar from Second Life. Nonetheless, I am with Sarah on this one (as well as on the unacceptability of \"palling around with terrorists\": like her, I far prefer to speak at rallies advocating that Alaska should separate from the United States. We are so winning this competition about who is a more loyal patriot, don't you reckon, Sarah? Anyway, back to our regularly scheduled programme.) I agree that men do have it hard when it comes to the hair issue and, you know, I'd almost feel bad for them if it weren't for things like childbirth, periods and, most of all, cellulite. This is not to sneer at your pain, Name. Yet the fact is that anything you do to rectify this unjust situation will make it a million times worse. Maybe it's because men, hilarious sources of gender cliches that they are, simply have not had the years of practice that the ladies have when it comes to, shall we say, cosmetic improvement. This explains the male inability to select a wig that does not either look like a giant Shredded Wheat carefully balanced upon their skull, or turn them into Action Man, thanks to this apparently solid cap of blackness perching atop their pate and just begging to be removed by some great hand, reaching down from the sky. Moreover, I would urge you to go to see Tropic Thunder and see how baldness improves Tom Cruise immeasurably, turning him from his usual persona of the Michael Jackson of the 21st century (purely in the weirdness stakes, I hasten to add, Tom) into an actor who is, against all odds, funny. But returning to men's talents or otherwise with beautification, this also explains their inability to dye their hair any shade other than \"Screamingly Obvious Fake\". Look at Rupert Murdoch's bright orange tinge, look even at Paul McCartney's misguidedly midnight black shade. Oh sure, the man can write a million love songs, but when it comes to the dye, he has the subtle touch of Shrek on a bad day. Which effortlessly leads us, with just the faintest hint of a deafening screech of forced manoeuvring, to the pin-up de la saison, Robert Peston. Does he dye or not? Well, he insists not but, really, if there's anything we've all learned in this financial crisis it's that you can't trust anyone connected to the business world. That bulge in his pocket - secret documents or Just For Men? Oh please. We've all been naive fools for too long. Why are so many young women wearing blazers these days? Is the entire youth population experiencing a Sloane revival? Christine Poole, by email Yes, and this column gives a hearty hoo-rah for it. Blazers, cable-knit jumpers, alice bands, loafers: how can you not love a social group that models its daily uniform on what you yourself wore to school between the ages of five and 11? And ever since I read in the current edition of the Sloane's handbook, aka Tatler, that the atmosphere on my very street is \"electric\" (\"electric\" apparently being Sloane-speak for \"grubby and with a distinct whiff of illegality\"), I've decided not to fight it any more. If they love me so much, I shall love them, too. Come to my arms, Kate Middleton and Henry Conway! And let us have a right ol' knees up down Mahiki ce soir! But here's what niggles me just a tad about this Sloane revival. Yes, I get that it is an ironic homage to the glory days on the Kings Road, coupled with the influence of Gossip Girl and all its spoilt, monied, Upper East Side glory. Call me an evil old hen, but is there not something weird about aspiring to look like the indolent and pointless upper classes? On the one hand, I want to applaud its honesty: after all, fashion always involves expenditure in the end, so isn't it better to see clothes that acknowledge their expense than designer clothes that attempt to look all grunge for credibility's sake in a kind of reverse snob stylee? On the other hand, everyone is dressing like pampered prisses. Oh Karl Marx, there ain't no resting in peace for you, I fear. \u2022 Post questions to Ask Hadley, The Guardian, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER. email: ask.hadley@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
