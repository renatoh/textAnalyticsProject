The reality of The Lumberjacks is simpler, but thoroughly rewarding as a comedy proposition. This is an onstage reunion of three of Canada's finest comedy exports: Glenn Wool, Craig Campbell and Stewart Francis. It's 15 years since they made their UK debut, appearing together in a showcase at the Edinburgh festival fringe. Since then they've each individually carved out niches for themselves on the British stand-up scene: Wool as a perpetually befuddled raconteur and theorist, Campbell as a long-haired lover of the great outdoors, and Francis as a bone-dry, achingly funny coiner of great puns and one-liners. This year they're getting back together to provide a triple bill that won't simply appeal to expat Canucks, but to anyone who relishes first-class comedy. The Court Theatre, Sun Katherine Ryan, On tour At least on the surface, Katherine Ryan seems to be doing OK. She's a good-looking girl with the beginnings of a TV career and a growing stand-up profile to match. But she's only got this far after fighting a few battles, not least with skin cancer and the autoimmune disease lupus. Perhaps these serious health issues have played a part in forging her particularly devil-may-care approach to comedy. Ryan is one of those comics who is willing to say anything onstage, regardless of what it might make the public think of her. She'll lay claim to the most sordid sexual misadventures, talks of life spent smashing through taboos, even telling her audience that she snorted coke while heavily pregnant. Of course, much of this is wild exaggeration and mischief in pursuit of laughs, but it makes Ryan come across as a rather fearless performer; and that combination of butter-wouldn't-melt looks and a filthy mouth means she can score big with the crowds. Downstairs At The Kings Head, N8, Sun; Hen &amp; Chicken, Bristol, Thu; South Street Arts Centre, Reading, Fri Sarah Kendall, London &amp; Bristol The comedian-turned-parent is one of the less rewarding fixtures of the stand-up circuit. It's a path far too well-trodden by male comedians: all of a sudden, a kid comes along and your set becomes all about the things your offspring says and does and how it's changed the way you look at your life. Australian comic Sarah Kendall has become a mother, but she hasn't let this soften the cutting edge that's behind all her best stuff. She speaks bluntly (and hilariously) about what a nightmare the whole thing can be. It's easy to empathise with her tale of hiding from her failure to deal with her own screaming baby on a long-haul flight, eventually hiding (sobbing) in the toilet with a glass of white wine. She's currently running in a new set of routines in advance of the annual Edinburgh slugfest, and could be a real contender for honours.
