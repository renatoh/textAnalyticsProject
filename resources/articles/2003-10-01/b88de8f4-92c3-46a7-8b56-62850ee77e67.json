Darkest day: Their 1995 quarter-final. Losing to the Poms was troubling; losing to a last-minute Rob Andrew drop goal was a salt-and-wound job. Won't let you forget: David Campese's virtuoso performance in the 1991 semi-final against the All Blacks, including an outrageous over-the-shoulder pass to put Tim Horan over. For once, Campo walked the walk. Svengali factor: Coach Eddie Jones is chippy, confident, aggressive, brash and ambitious. Typically Australian, then. His introduction of numerous decoy runners does not deliver too many tries these days, but it has certainly wound up numerous coaches. How do you beat them? Ask England, New Zealand and South Africa, who all did the trick this summer. The Wallabies backline is top class, but up front they have problems. How do they beat you? Jones cites the recent State of Origin rugby league clash between New South Wales and Queensland as the benchmark for how he wants his union boys to play. A game combining speed of action and passing with skill. Whether he's had the time to develop this is a different matter. Lost without: George Smith. The best open-side in the game eclipsed Neil Back in the 2001 Lions series - which says it all. Sidelined with injury for most of last season, now raring to weave his magic. Avoid in a dark alley: Despite looking five feet wide, flanker Phil Waugh is a supreme athlete who tackles everything that moves. Words of wisdom: 'There is a fair bit of expectation and ultimately I have to take responsibility for the team,' Jones sensationally reveals. The home view: 'The Wallabies are conscious that home support could derail them as much as it could push them,' says Rupert Guinness of Sydney's Daily Telegraph. OSM prediction: The defeats to the big three have left Australia, seemingly, with little chance. But their pedigree suggests they will turn up again and home advantage should gain them a semi-final place against New Zealand. Then, who knows? The squad Backs: M Burke, E Flatley, M Giteau, G Gregan, N Grey, S Larkham, C Latham, S Mortlock, J Roff, M Rogers, W Sailor, L Tuqiri, M Turinui, C Whitaker. Forwards: A Baxter, B Cannon, M Cockbain, D Croft, B Darwin, M Dunning, D Giffin, J Harrison, D Lyons, J Paul, J Roe, N Sharpe, G Smith, D Vickerman, P Waugh, B Young. Pool A contender: Nathan Sharpe Two years after the retirement of John Eales, Australia's victorious skipper of 1999, the 6ft 6in, 18st Sharpe looks to have the mobility, handling skills and spirit to lead the Wallaby pack. 'He still has only limited Test experience, but potentially he's got it all,' says Wallaby coach Eddie Jones. If he bosses the loose-forward play then the hosts could go further than the expected semi-final spot."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
