In an interview with the Observer, Carolyn Fairbairn, the outgoing director general of the CBI, said that securing a basic deal with the EU should be seen as a \u201cstarting point\u201d for a deeper relationship. She warned of a serious effect on Britain\u2019s large services sector, including financial and legal services, as well as engineering. UK government officials remain locked in talks with their Brussels counterparts this weekend, just a fortnight before the deadline identified as the last point at which a deal can be agreed. The main stumbling blocks remain fishing rights and \u201clevel playing field\u201d conditions related to state aid. However, even if a deal is signed off, there are grave concerns among British business bodies over the barriers to trade that it will erect. Fairbairn said that any deal would be a \u201csignificant improvement\u201d on a no-deal outcome, while the removal of tariffs would be \u201cexistential\u201d for the car industry. However, she said her \u201creally big disappointment\u201d was the lack of help for British services in the potential deal, adding that the CBI would immediately fight to broaden the agreement. \u201cAny deal we get now is likely to be focused on goods, and it should be treated as a starting point for a more comprehensive deal in the future,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the CBI, we would be doing two things. First of all, we would be looking to help businesses make the most of where we are, to look for the opportunities and to manage that transition. And second, we will be working with the government and supporting the negotiations around building further chapters. [We would like] a services chapter. We\u2019ll need more on aviation. We\u2019ll need more on haulage. Data will be crucial. We hope that there will be a data agreement, but there will be more to do on the back of that. That will be the challenge of the next one to two years. And we will be on that case pretty well immediately. But we need that base case of a foundation deal first.\u201d Some groups have raised serious concerns about the extent of new barriers to trade that will be erected even in the event of a deal. While tariffs will be removed, bureaucracy will increase and both government and industry are braced for issues at the border. A business taskforce to manage the transition has been forged between government and industry in an attempt to smooth the Brexit process in the new year. Looking back on a tumultuous five years in the job, Fairbairn said it had \u201cbeen a mistake, and a lost opportunity for our country\u201d for businesses not to have had greater involvement in the shape of the deal. Cash reserves and stockpiling have been run down as a result of the virus, with many businesses assuming the Brexit transition period would simply be extended. \u201cThere is some wishful thinking,\u201d Fairbairn said. \u201cThe single thing that would be getting businesses preparing best is a deal. Disruption of some sort is likely.\u201d It comes as Boris Johnson is being warned that securing a deal with the EU is the best and easiest way to improve relations with a Joe Biden White House, should the Democratic candidate win this week. Biden has voiced concern that Johnson\u2019s Brexit tactics could affect Northern Ireland\u2019s Good Friday Agreement. Sir Nigel Sheinwald, Britain\u2019s former ambassador to the US who served in Washington between 2007 and 2012, said that a deal was the route through which Johnson could build relations with Biden. \u201cI do think that they need to calculate what the impact of no deal would be, not just on the future relationship over free trade agreements, but more generally, on Britain\u2019s standing with a new Biden administration,\u201d he said. \u201cNo deal looks a very lonely position if you\u2019ve got a Biden administration in Washington. \u201cThe very strong view among Biden\u2019s team is that Brexit was a strategic mistake of some magnitude. They\u2019ll be wondering how we fill that gap and will have concluded over the past four years that we haven\u2019t really been able to identify a new British role in the world.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
