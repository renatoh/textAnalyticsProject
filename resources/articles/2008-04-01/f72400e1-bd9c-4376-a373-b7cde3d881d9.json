With the second-choice Carlo Cudicini expected to be sidelined for at least another three weeks with a hamstring injury, Grant has only the occasionally used Henrique Hilario and the teenager Rhys Taylor as fully fit back-up. Hilario has filled in adequately in the past, not least last season after Cech and Cudicini both ended up in hospital after the match at Reading, with the former returning with a rugby-style helmet to protect a fractured skull. Now a chin-guard is being tested after Cech's training-ground collision with Tal Ben Haim that left him requiring 50 stitches. \"He had one training session with a mask and one without,\" Grant said. \"We are checking all the possibilities with him. It would be a risk but I am not a doctor.\" As for Cudicini, Grant admitted: \"He could be out for the season.\" Should victory at home be followed by a similar success at Everton on Thursday, then a side that appeared to be in disarray when Grant succeeded Jose Mourinho in September would have the Premier League trophy firmly in its sights when Manchester United come to Stamford Bridge on April 26. Such a scenario would go a long way towards justifying Grant's claim that his pool of players has no equal when all are available but once again he has selection problems at the top of his team list. Grant was certain, however, that his players had proved themselves to be more durable than Arsenal in their pursuit of the Premier League trophy they surrendered to United under Mourinho last season, especially as they are still in the Champions League. \"We are so close,\" he said. \"I said to the players it has been a difficult year and I don't know if other clubs could have done what we have with all the injuries we have had and so many big players at the African Nations Cup. \"With all the problems that we have had we have still been winning games. \"We did all this and have come to the last stage with a very good opportunity to be the best team and we don't want to miss it. They know it is a big opportunity and, if I may say so, we deserve it. \"Arsenal played very well until one or two players got injured and you saw it is not easy to win without injured players but we did it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
