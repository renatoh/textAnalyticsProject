In a deal to be announced today, the Hampshire-based firm is paying a small up-front sum to the university, which will share in any future sales. Genetix expects sales of $100,000 (\u00a365,000) from the substance within a year, rising to several million in four or five years. The DNA-based reagent is used to test the blood or saliva of patients for tiny genetic mutations. Unlike most existing reagents, it can detect missing bits of chromosome as well as alterations to the human chromosome. Genetix intends to sell the substance to researchers, to help them pin down mutations which cause breast cancer, Duchenne muscular distrophy and certain mental disabilities. Genetix chief scientific officer Julian Burke said: \"This is a good way of leveraging academic science into the company.\" Genetix floated in November at 150p and has so far weathered the stock market's falls. Its shares closed at 211p on Friday. The company's robotic equipment was used in seven of the leading labs responsible for mapping the human genome. The number of high-profile deals between biotech companies and universities is increasing. Oxford Biomedica recently bought the rights to research a gene for nerve repair patented by King's college, London."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
