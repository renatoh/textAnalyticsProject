To my delight, I was advised I was \u00a32,500 in credit and promised a cheque within 10 days. It didn\u2019t come and only when I chased was I told the refund was \u201cunder investigation\u201d. I complained, and within five minutes received an email stating the complaint was closed. Then I was told again I would receive a cheque within 10 days. Again it didn\u2019t come. This time it said the finance department would contact me within five working days. A day later, I discovered that the credit had been reduced to \u00a31,500. I\u2019ve still not received any of it and, as a single mother, I could really do with the money. DB, Fairburn, West Yorkshire You might still be waiting if you had not contacted the media. First Utility explained that before it could send the cheque, another monthly bill was generated automatically using estimated readings. This affected the balance, hence the delay. It\u2019s now been recalculated using your meter readings, as it should have been weeks ago and the full \u00a32,524.42 has been refunded along with \u00a350 to acknowledge the incompetence. \u201cWe\u2019d like to apologise for the confusion surrounding her account,\u201d it says. \u201cThe issue stems from the fact that we did not receive any meter reads so had to use estimates.\u201d It\u2019s important you read your meter regularly and update your supplier, otherwise you either end up extending them a large loan or being faced with a bill for underpayment.
