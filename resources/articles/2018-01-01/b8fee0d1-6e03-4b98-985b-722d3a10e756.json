Joshua\u2019s heart, hand speed and ability to take a punch have all been questioned by Parker\u2019s camp in recent months, with the WBO heavyweight champion suggesting Joshua has been knocked down several times in sparring. However Joshua, who will put his WBA super, IBF and IBO belts on the line against Parker on 31 March in Cardiff, insisted he had been hurt only three times in his career. \u201cThere is a lot of talk about me being dropped,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s only happened three times. The first was the European championships, when only two weeks before I had been called back into the programme, because I was banned from the GB team. I was very unfit but I got stopped not dropped. \u201cThe second time was with David Price, I came out of a police cell the day before and went up there to spar. Price is a puncher and that was down to lack of experience. And [Wladimir] Klitschko taught me that it will take more than a human to stop me from going where I am going. The rumours the Parker camp have heard are fake news.\u201d At the weekend Parker had also suggested Joshua was the \u201cking of steroids\u201d but on Tuesday he rowed back on the remark. \u201cThey accused me of being the king of pies, so that was the first thing that came into my head,\u201d he admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things you say without thinking and it wasn\u2019t the best thing to say.\u201dJoshua\u2019s promoter, Eddie Hearn, said he had paid \u201csomething like \u00a330,000\u201d to ensure the fighters would be tested with the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association on top of random testing through UK Anti-Doping. \u201cThe last three or four fights we have been tested eight times in camp by Vada and Ukad over a 12-week period,\u201d he added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
