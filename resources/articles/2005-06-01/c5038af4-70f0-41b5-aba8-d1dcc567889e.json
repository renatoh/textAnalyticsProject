More than three-quarters (77%) of those surveyed on plans to introduce electronic healthcare records said healthcare professionals should seek patients' explicit consent before putting their records online. The opinion poll was launched to coincide with a motion being discussed today on the second day of the BMA's annual conference on the threat to patient confidentiality once computerised care records are rolled out. The majority (93%) said the general public should be fully consulted before the proposals are finalised. But the system is already underway, although a number of \"technical challenges\" have prompted the rollout to be rescheduled, with the majority of healthcare record now expected to be online during the course of next year, according to the Department of Health. The public has given its qualified backing to the scheme. Three in four of the survey's 2,000 respondents said they were happy to have their health information held on a central computer system, and a similar number (69%) said they would have no problem with this information being shared and seen by relevant individuals involved in their care. But the majority admitted they were worried about how safe the information would be as a result of the information being computerised, with 81% concerned that people other than the healthcare professionals providing their care could access their personal information. Three in five (61%) said patients should also be allowed the unprecedented right to add information to their healthcare records. Barbara Wood, co-chair of BMA's patient liaison group said the survey revealed genuine concern that non-clinicians may be able to access their personal data. She said: \"Patients do want to be able to put information into their own record themselves and have the opportunity to correct what is wrong. \"They have some concerns about the existence of a patient's 'envelope' as a private space in which they can store sensitive information but are much more worried about the doctor also being able to record information which is not accessible to them. \"Patient groups must be consulted in a meaningful way about the project as it develops if it is to stand any chance of being accepted by the public.\" \u00b7 60% of doctors who qualified 10 years ago are disillusioned about their career today compared to how they felt when they first qualified, according to the results of another survey by the British Medical Association presented to its annual conference today."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
