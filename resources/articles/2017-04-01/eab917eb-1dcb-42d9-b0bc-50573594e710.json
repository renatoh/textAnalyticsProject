Appearing for cross-examination on Friday afternoon, Middlebrook also answered further questions about his actions authorising the use of teargas against detainees in August 2014. Middlebrook was taken through a number of distressing incidents involving juvenile detainees threatening or carrying out self-harm in detention. He defended the use of the restraint chair as a response in some cases, despite saying on Wednesday he wasn\u2019t certain at the time that it was lawful. Middlebrook had already provided extensive testimony on the lack of resources provided to juvenile corrections during his time as commissioner and he said there was little else available to deal with a distressed detainee in the middle of the night. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to get those professional services but where are they? They\u2019re not in the community and one thing I hope the commissioners achieve out of this is to make sure the government gives the appropriate support for young people,\u201d he said. \u201cTry and get those supports at 2 o\u2019clock in the morning or even on a Saturday or Sunday, it\u2019s just not there.\u201d He said detention centres and prisons had become \u201cde facto mental health facilities\u201d. Middlebrook also told the royal commission he wasn\u2019t aware that a detainee who got out of his behavioural management unit cell in August 2014 was asking to talk to a youth officer before guards teargassed him. He said he didn\u2019t hear on the night that the child had asked to speak to youth justice officer Ben Kelleher but was refused. \u201cIf I\u2019d have been told that, I would have made that happen, I would have facilitated that,\u201d he said. Middlebrook agreed it was \u201cscandalous\u201d and \u201cdisgraceful\u201d that a youth justice officer suggested he would \u201cpulverise the little fucker\u201d if the 14-year-old detainee came through a window \u2013 as was caught on footage and reported by the children\u2019s commissioner. Middlebrook said he didn\u2019t know who that officer was and didn\u2019t try to find out. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you find out and show them the door?\u201d Lawrence asked. \u201cWhen you haven\u2019t trained them and you haven\u2019t prepared them well, I think we had an obligation to fix the entire system and that\u2019s what we were trying to do,\u201d Middlebrook responded. It \u201cmay well have been\u201d a failure on his part but Middlebrook said it didn\u2019t demonstrate \u201csystemic abuse for years\u201d inside the centre, as suggested by the boy\u2019s lawyer, John Lawrence. Youth justice officers were responding to instances of behaviour and \u201cthe same group of hardcore young individuals\u201d were causing a lot of the problems, he said. They weren\u2019t equipped to deal with these offenders, he said. \u201cMy response to this was the get the Vita report so that I could put a report to government to say you\u2019ve got to fix this.\u201d He said he wasn\u2019t happy to use teargas but he had no other choice in how to to resolve the situation. He said he was concerned the detainee would knock out the power and the lights would go off. On Thursday the former minister John Elferink said he had commissioned the Vita review because he had conflicting assessments from the children\u2019s commissioner \u2013 who agreed with him that some acts by guards during that night appeared to be criminal \u2013 and Middlebrook, who told him appropriate steps were being taken. Middlebrook was also questioned about allegations by the then children\u2019s commissioner, Howard Bath, that staff gave false information and affidavits during a police investigation into a guard\u2019s alleged abuse of a detainee and sought to prevent police obtaining CCTV footage of an incident. \u201cI don\u2019t think the staff were trying to cover something up,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they were, they could have easily erased that footage.\u201d Middlebrook\u2019s cross-examination followed an appearance by the former NT chief minister Adam Giles. Giles was unable to answer questions about key details relating to youth detention policy, the conditions inside facilities and incidents. He told the commission he \u201ccould not recall\u201d more than 60 times and defended his decision to not provide a written statement or documentation to the commission. Giles said he hadn\u2019t read a number of key reports into juvenile detention and that no one had brought specific concerns to him about the state of facilities in Darwin in Alice Springs, or the treatment of detainees by guards. Thursday heard from Elferink, who also could not recall receiving briefings on several key reports into the state of detention but said he was aware of the general issues. He said he was \u201cdisturbed\u201d by the state of detention when he became minister and sought to make improvements to conditions but did not receive financial support from his cabinet."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
