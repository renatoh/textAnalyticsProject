Rooney\u2019s display against Tottenham Hotspur on the opening day of the season was also questioned yet the 29-year-old believes only his performance against Villa was below par. He has failed to score in his past nine competitive matches for United \u2013 including Tuesday\u2019s 3-1 win over Club Brugge in the Champions League play-offs \u2013 in a run that stretches back to 4 April last season. But when asked about his form he made it clear he believes the criticism is exaggerated. \u201cI\u2019ve had one bad game this season and everyone\u2019s all over it,\u201d said Rooney. \u201cI know I\u2019ve had that all throughout my career but hopefully at the weekend I can get off the mark.\u201d Louis van Gaal is fielding Rooney as the central striker, and the manager and player believe he can score 25 goals-plus from that position. Does Rooney remain confident of this? \u201cYeah, of course. I\u2019m an honest guy, I know when I haven\u2019t played well and against Aston Villa I was below my standards and I know that. Fortunately I had a much better game [against Club Brugge], I could have got a goal or two but that\u2019s football.\u201d Rooney admitted his touch at Villa was substandard. \u201cI lost the ball too easily and I\u2019m aware of that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a game I\u2019ll want to look back on but obviously you have games like that. \u201cIt\u2019s early on in the season. Everyone will write about the end of last season and the beginning of this season [not scoring] but we\u2019re three games into the new season, so it\u2019s down to me to keep going. I\u2019ve experienced this before and the goals will come, I know that, and hopefully that day will come on Saturday against Newcastle. \u201cI had a couple of half-chances [against Brugge], with the header in the first half, and a couple which I was reaching for, especially early on with the cross off Adnan [Januzaj]. But I think I just have to keep putting myself in the right positions and hopefully one will come.\u201d Rooney denied feeling the pressure of being the focus of United\u2019s attack. \u201cNo. I always set myself standards and I try to reach them. My mind\u2019s clear. I know how to play the role. It\u2019s just a case of getting the chances and taking them, which I\u2019m hopeful I\u2019m going to do soon,\u201d he said, before pointing to the goals from Memphis Depay and Marouane Fellaini that defeated Brugge. \u201cI understand it\u2019s on me to get the goals but Memphis has chipped in with two goals, Felly when he has come on with a goal, and we all have to chip in, but I understand I need to be the one who leads that line for us and try to get the goals for us.\u201d Rooney was replaced by Fellaini late on. John Terry, the Chelsea captain, was substituted at half-time by Jos\u00e9 Mourinho in last Sunday\u2019s 3-0 loss at Manchester City. While Terry was not happy about his rare withdrawal, Rooney stated he had no issue with being taken off. \u201cNo, of course not. You want to play the games, obviously,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Felly gives us a different style if you like, in terms of getting the ball in the box earlier and try and push that goal, late doors, which has obviously paid off for us.\u201d Rooney has a good record against Saturday\u2019s visitors to Old Trafford, Newcastle. \u201cI did against Aston Villa as well,\u201d he joked. \u201cNo, I obviously enjoy playing against Newcastle so hopefully on Saturday I can get off the mark and open my scoring for the season.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
