Williams, going for his third UK title eight years after his second, prevailed 9-7 over Mark Joyce, the world No60 from Walsall, whose consolation was a career-best payday of \u00a316,450. Robertson, still in bed 12 minutes before the off because he had not read the schedule properly, the latest in a litany of assorted misadventures for which he has become notorious, made the highest break of the afternoon, 126, but had to win its last frame to adjourn at 4-4. The Australian also made 120 for 6-6 but Murphy, slightly less prone to occasional error amid the overall high quality, won three of the next four frames to advance, the last disrupted by a 15-minute stoppage because of a scoreboard malfunction. \"Neil's a class act and his current record speaks for itself,\" said Murphy. \"He's always a player you feel satisfied to beat.\" The manner of Williams's 9-6 defeat of Stephen Hendry in the last 16 did not imbue him with confidence but, even so, experience and reputation seemed to count for something against a maiden quarter-finalist as he led Joyce 4-0. Joyce, the English amateur champion in 2006, then began to show the kind of form which had taken him past four opponents in qualifying, including Steve Davis, and two here, Ali Carter, the world No3, and another substantially higher ranked player, Judd Trump, 27th on the list. His work with a sports psychologist helped him \"with mental imagery and blocking out the crowd. The key in this sport, and most others, is to focus properly and not allow the pressure to get the better of you,\" he said. Consecutive breaks of 109 and 91 began his recovery to 4-4 at the interval but at 5-5 there was a taste of vintage Williams with a clearance of 71 from 47 behind to which he added a clinching 56 to lead 7-5. Again Joyce responded with a total clearance of 143, the highest break of the tournament and the best of his career. At 7-8 Joyce was still in it but Williams made his highest break of the match, 82, to clinch his win. \"I don't know how I'm in the semi-final,\" said Williams. \"Sometimes you've got to win playing not so good.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
