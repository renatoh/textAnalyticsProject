She is a star who deserves to be seen more often in British cinemas and holds the screen in this movie with cool self-possession and elegance throughout. The same can't exactly be said for her opposite number: a smirking, womanising lawyer, who also happens to be a brilliant jazz pianist, called Antoine, played by Nicolas Bedos; he is frankly annoying and supercilious in ways that aren't intentional. Sagnier plays Julie, an aspiring artist who has been trying to build her career in New York, and after a troubled time is now on the plane home to Paris. Who should she find herself sitting next to but Antoine, her appallingly smug ex. They spar coldly and their defunct affair is disclosed to us in a series of flashbacks: it's all put across with gusto, but also a fair bit of slightly wince-making cliche, stereotyping and broad comedy. Sagnier deservesa classier vehicle than this."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
