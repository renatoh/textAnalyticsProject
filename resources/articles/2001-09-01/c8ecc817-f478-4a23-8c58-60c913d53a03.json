The 21-year-old striker will be allowed to leave \"when suitable arrangements can be made\". Cadamarteri was fined \u00a32,000 this month for punching a young woman in the face during a late-night fracas in October. The club have also agreed that the player will donate to local charities a sum equivalent to the amount of legal aid he received to fight his case. Cadamarteri has offered to devote a substantial amount of his time to assisting Everton's Football in the Community scheme. An Everton spokesman said: \"The player acknowledges that his actions brought discredit to himself, his family and his club, resulting in unnecessary and potentially damaging publicity. He wishes to offer a full and public apology.\" Southampton have released the striker Uwe R\u00f6sler on a free transfer. The former German international started the first three Premiership matches of the season but lost his place in last week's Worthington Cup match at Brighton."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
