It tells the story of 16-year-old Jenny being dazzled by the 30-something David, who deftly tricks Jenny into believing he\u2019s a single and honorable man through increasingly lavish gifts. The director Lone Scherfig and the writer Nick Hornby delicately explore many of the issues in play, from David\u2019s predatory actions, to issues of class, to the changing roles and expectations of women during the 1960s. An Education is well done because it\u2019s a breakup film on several levels: between Jenny and her family, Jenny and David, and then Jenny and the person she believes she wants to be. College is difficult and frustrating, and coming from suburbia, Jenny sees her future as uncertain and dark. David, with his trips to Paris and sophisticated friends, embodies an easy out for Jenny, so she abandons all other relationships and drops out of school for him. As a child, she doesn\u2019t notice until it\u2019s almost too late that David is an emotionally stunted manchild, a negligent father, and a con artist to boot. It\u2019s such a heartbreaking discovery to watch, and was all the more painful to see as a teen still trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. Many tears are shed, but ultimately I love An Education because it\u2019s an uplifting film: Jenny redoes her last year, goes to Oxford and ultimately is able to look back on her time with that creepy man as educational rather than traumatizing. GS (500) Days of Summer The relationship comedy-drama (500) Days of Summer, starring Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, is a breakup story with something of Nick Hornby or Woody Allen, told out of narrative order by the lovelorn Tom (Levitt), as he obsessively recounts the various 500 days of his failed, unhappy relationship with a beautiful young woman called Summer (Deschanel). It was an original script by Scott Neustadter and Michael Weber, who went on to adapt The Fault In Our Stars. Looking back, I see that I didn\u2019t like it too much at the time. But I\u2019ve found myself semi-accidentally and then deliberately catching it on TV over the years, and I\u2019ve seen how ungenerous I was. It is a really fervent, and even devastating story of male heartbreak, encapsulated by the now legendary \u201csplit-screen\u201d sequence showing Tom\u2019s Expectations versus Reality, as he shows up to a post-breakup party thrown by Summer. On the left side of the screen, we see his fantasies that their old magic will somehow kick in and they will get back together, on the right, we see the agonising reality of her distant, polite greetings to someone who is now in the friend zone. These scenes unfold in parallel and then gradually diverge in a way which is excruciating. I can\u2019t believe there is anyone who hasn\u2019t hopefully, pathetically shown up to a party to which they have been diplomatically invited by someone who\u2019s dumped them \u2013 invited, in fact, with the specific purpose of subsuming them back into the platonic category of \u201cfriendship\u201d. But the rejectee will always agonisingly hope-against-hope that something might still happen. 500 Days Of Summer isn\u2019t a masterpiece but it\u2019s got the authentic vinegar taste of male romantic sadness. My one quarrel is that the woman with whom Tom then finds happiness is called Autumn. Surely that should be Spring? PB Happy Together The films of Wong Kar-wai are made out of sighs; the contented swoon of a new infatuation, the panting gasp of overheating pleasure, the defeated exhalation that\u2019s all one can manage when an emotional weight is pressing down on their chest. His cinema understands all expressions of passion, whether filtered through love or lust or pain, to come from the same naked need for human connection. My favorite work from the Chinese master focuses on a corollary idea, that the vulnerability required of that connection can make us guarded, which in turn perverts affection into vindictiveness and trust into self-destructive obsession. Wong makes the daring suggestion, a conclusion far too uncommon in western romance films, that breaking up can be its own gesture of devotion. A gay couple (Leslie Cheung and Tony Leung Chiu-wai, the latter delivering what is in this writer\u2019s opinion one of the greatest performances ever committed to celluloid) go to Buenos Aires to break up their toxic on-again-off-again routine, only to split without enough money to return to Asia. Their ensuing attempts to build lives separate of one another, many of them failed, clarify the unique terms of a relationship that thrives on dysfunction and recreational cruelty. The same things keeping them together \u2013 a codependency bridging the gap between neediness and the need to be needed \u2013 make it impossible for them to last. And with ravishing colors courtesy of the cinematographer Christopher Doyle, the lush Argentinian scenery refracts their overgrown, untamed feelings back at them. CB Brokeback Mountain I didn\u2019t watch Brokeback Mountain as an emerging-from-the-closet teenager, even though it felt like required viewing. I was interested in \u201cedgier\u201d stuff at the time (like Maurice and Y Tu Mam\u00e1 Tambi\u00e9n) and thought the film would be overly sentimental. Thank God I held off. Because Brokeback Mountain is a film best appreciated by those familiar with heartbreak. I watched it for the first time last year, in my mid-twenties, and found myself deeply moved by the star-crossed-lovers and their poignant breakup because, even while hurling curse words and threats at each other, the two men are still in love. \u201cWe could\u2019ve had a real good life together,\u201d Jack shouts at the top of his lungs, his lips quivering. \u201cHad a place of our own.\u201d I love the grounded specificity of Jack\u2019s \u201chappily-ever-after.\u201d How \u2013 in the midst of calling it quits \u2013 Jack paints a world where he and Ennis have a ranch and live in domestic bliss. As a queer person, I can easily connect with this kind of fantasy-building. Imagining how easier life would be if the pressures of society weren\u2019t so great. Brokeback Mountain is a product of its time. Hollywood\u2019s queer representation skewed towards melancholy back then \u2013 a reflection of the scant rights and protections the LGBTQ community had in America. Today, queer cinema is finally beginning to provide some happy endings (think: Love, Simon and God\u2019s Own Country). Which is important for a slew of reasons. But I like to watch Brokeback Mountain every now and then when I need a reminder that, not too long ago, our love stories too often ended in heartbreak. AW The War of the Roses At the tail end of 1989, mere weeks away from a new decade, audiences were gifted with an unusual Christmas present: the violent, foul-mouthed destruction of a much-loved movie couple. In hit screwball adventures Romancing the Stone and Jewel of the Nile, Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas quipped and kissed their way in and and out of PG-level jeopardy but in The War of the Roses, the danger wasn\u2019t in the jungle or the desert but it was in the home and, most disturbingly, in each other. It\u2019s a relentlessly, audaciously nasty little film wrapped up in glossy packaging with a deceptively sprightly score, fooling you into briefly forgetting just how mean-spirited the whole thing is. We\u2019re shown how an annoyingly perfect, somewhat smug, married couple is torn apart, not by infidelity or abuse, but by growing, seething resentment which finally boils to the surface in the most hysterically, horribly funny manner. After Douglas\u2019 preening lawyer survives what he thinks is a heart attack, Turner\u2019s exhausted housewife tells him the whole debacle made her imagine what life would be like with him dead and, to his disgust, it made her feel happy and free. She tells him: \u201cWhen I watch you eat. When I see you asleep. When I look at you lately, I just want to smash your face in.\u201d He dares her to do it. She does. And then the gloves are really off. He destroys her shoes, she locks him in the sauna, he pisses on her food, she ruins his car and they continue to verbally and physically abuse each other until a final brutal showdown ending with them both dead after falling from a chandelier mid-fight. For a moment, we\u2019re fooled into thinking the film is softening as a dying husband lays a hand on his dying wife but as the music swells and we think she\u2019s reaching to hold him back, instead she pushes it off. It remains one of the most staggeringly sour endings to a studio comedy I\u2019ve ever seen and one that I can\u2019t even imagine making it to the big screen now. For me, the single, never-married product of divorced parents, there\u2019s always been something grimly compelling about watching a marriage fall apart on such a grandiose and grotesque stage, no holds barred, played for sadistic laughs. Maybe it\u2019s the savage, if exaggerated, honesty of it I always admired, that underneath the civility of married life, there are two people quietly waiting to piss all over the other one\u2019s dinner. BL Like Crazy Like Crazy documents the mostly long-distance love between Anna (Felicity Jones) and Jacob (Anton Yelchin) that withers under the pressures of time and 6,000 miles (Jacob based in LA, Anna confined by an overstayed visa to the UK). While doing press for the film, the director Drake Doremus said the actors were given an emotional outline of the characters, and the actors filled the rest in, improvising how they\u2019d imagine their characters would fall in love, then fall apart. I can count on my fingers the number of movies that have made me actually cry, and perhaps this is why Like Crazy is one of them: it captures exactly the spontaneity of a relationship\u2019s growth and decay \u2013 in particular, the magnetic pull of phone as a portal both treasured and loathed, the gap between where your mind is and where you are, the realization that someone\u2019s life has gone on without you. (It did not help that I watched it in light of Yelchin\u2019s devastating accidental death at age 27). At the end, Anna and Jacob stand together in the shower, embracing, finally getting what they wanted only to doubt that want in the first place. They look at each other and say nothing, but I heard: you don\u2019t know this person anymore. Maybe you never really did. It\u2019s not a breakup scene, per se, but their unguardedness is broken. The last shot lingers on Jacob\u2019s face in the shower, haunted not by Anna\u2019s absence but her presence, and processing one of the most unsettling experiences I know \u2013 the feeling of your old certainty about someone crumbling into doubt, and realizing your own sparks can fade. AH Le Chat The breakups that break my heart are the ones that don\u2019t involve a break at all. No dramatic exits, just the misery of a relationship\u2019s long-drawn-out demise. That\u2019s the painful case in Pierre Granier-Deferre\u2019s melancholic 1971 movie Le Chat. It stars two magnificent actors: Simone Signoret and Jean Gabin, who would have made a sizzling on-screen couple once, smouldering across the age-gap. Here, in a film made towards the end of both their careers, they give electric performances as people trapped in a relationship that has run out of love. Married for more than 25 years and now retired, they live separately but together, sharing a house in a city district that is being razed for redevelopment. Nothing stands around here but their funny little home, just as nothing exists of their marriage but their shared address. Perhaps they were always an unlikely pair, a typesetter and a circus star, but once upon a time in a flashback Julien and Cl\u00e9mence loved each other. And then one day he didn\u2019t any more, so now Cl\u00e9mence is miserable. They\u2019re cruel to each other, in petty ways, and sometimes she drinks too much and flies into a rage, but otherwise they pass their days eating, reading and sleeping in each other\u2019s stifling presence, in a bitter silence made up of all the sentences left unsaid \u2013 words of recrimination or regret, or \u201cI\u2019m leaving\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t go\u201d. The only messages that get through are notes on scraps of paper, like the one passed day after day from Julien to Cl\u00e9mence that reads: \u201cLe chat?\u201d. Because if it\u2019s awful enough to watch these two people suffering, it\u2019s nothing to what happens to Julien\u2019s poor cat. PH Starship Troopers I can\u2019t say I\u2019m a particular fan of movie breakups: they\u2019re miserable enough to endure in real life without having to see them projected on the big screen. But I always admired the way Denise Richards dumped Casper Van Dien in Starship Troopers \u2013 via interplanetary video message, the sci-fi equivalent of Daniel Day Lewis\u2019 fax to Isabelle Adjani. Recollect the scene, if you will. Casper \u2013 or Johnny Rico, as this blond alpha male is called \u2013 receives a much anticipated missive from the lovely Carmen; she, being a thousand times smarter than him, is on her way to becoming a military pilot, while he is stuck with the grunts in the infantry. So, while all Rico\u2019s squadmates are leering over his shoulder, Carmen gives him the old dagger in the heart: \u201cI\u2019m gonna go career\u201d. Her job comes first. That\u2019s one in the eye for the perfectly-chiselled schlub. But this breakup is a bit more than simple teen-movie trauma. Starship Troopers is one of the all time great satires, and this is just part of it. Johnny Rico, the Buenos Aires-dwelling ubermensch, might be a superman on the football field but outside school he\u2019s the opposite of a high flyer. Getting dumped by Carmen is just the start: he messes up his command, gets mercilessly flogged and is reported dead after a disastrous mission against the alien Bugs. Carmen\u2019s progress is equally questionable: she makes the grade professionally, but the man she dumped Rico for gets his brains sucked out by a revolting giant insect in front of her. You win some, you lose some. AP Blue is the Warmest Color Have there ever been quite so many tears in an on-screen breakup before? \u201cTears\u201d is putting it delicately, in fact. Really, it\u2019s the streams of snot running down the blotchy, swollen face of then-19-year-old actor Adele Exarchopoulos that give the climactic separation in Abdellatif Kechiche\u2019s three-hour lesbian coming-of-age romance a particular kind of brutal, wrenching authenticity. Nobody cries prettily in a breakup; rare is the film that admits as much. Still, the stakes in this breakup are higher than most. Radiant blue-haired artist Emma (Lea Seydoux) hasn\u2019t just been Adele\u2019s first girlfriend, but her guide into a new sexuality and a new self, from teenage uncertainty into assured womanhood: her memories of life before Emma are memories of another life entirely, one she never wants back. That kind of severance more than merits a bit of snot. But it gets better, as these things tend to do. Kechiche lingers on his film\u2019s exquisite post-breakup coda, showing how lives are rebuilt around the scar of an ended relationship, even if the pain never entirely goes away. We see Adele and Emma meet again twice, amicably but awkwardly. In a cafe, hopes for a reunion are dashed by Emma\u2019s announcement of her new, less sexually fulfilling relationship; later, at an exhibition of Emma\u2019s paintings, Adele spots a large nude of herself and leaves, as if finally assured that she\u2019s left something of herself behind. Emma will always have \u201cinfinite tenderness for her\u201d, she says, but Kechiche\u2019s intimate epic understands that recovering from a breakup is mostly about mending the split within yourself. GL Casablanca Much like when the kids say \u201cbad\u201d they mean \u201cgood,\u201d when Humphrey Bogart says \u201cI\u2019m no good at being noble\u201d what he means is \u201cstand back, world, I\u2019m about to be extremely good at being noble.\u201d Hollywood lore tells us that Casablanca was well into production before the last scene was written. A \u201chappy\u201d ending where Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) and Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) end up together was considered, but that would also mean Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) ended up dead or at least without \u201cthe thing that keeps him going\u201d (eg Ilsa) and, thus, unable to lead the fight against Nazism. No, Rick and Ilsa can\u2019t stay together, because \u201cthe problems of three little people don\u2019t amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world\u201d. What\u2019s strange, though, is no matter how many times I\u2019ve seen the film (and it\u2019s got to be over 30 by now) I still weirdly hope that one of those longing glances between Bogart and Bergman will break them out of their fate. Maybe this go round Louis Renault (Claude Raines) will come up with some kind of solution that gets Major Strasser (Conrad Veidt) off everyone\u2019s back, allowing for a moment to think this through like adults. Victor Lazslo isn\u2019t a bad guy; once he sees that being with Rick is what Ilsa wants (what Ilsa needs) he\u2019ll loosen his grip. And yet, every time, she acquiesces to Rick\u2019s martyrdom (\u201cyou said I was to do the thinking for us\u201d) and gets on that plane to Lisbon. Luckily, joining a Free French garrison in Brazzaville with Louie ought to keep Rick occupied as he mends his broken heart. JH Hannah and Her Sisters Annie Hall is Woody Allen\u2019s great breakup movie. Manhattan his prickliest; Crimes and Misdemeanors the one in which the dumping has the direst fallout. It would have been apt to choose that film for this feature, as Noah Baumbach riffs off it in While We\u2019re Young \u2013 plus its fabulously crass turn from Alan Alda, who\u2019s also in Marriage Story. But I\u2019m going for the Allen film I most frequently revisit, one which is really a series of breakups and hookups, bookended \u2013 and sandwich-filled \u2013 by three Thanksgiving parties, with plenty of flashbacks for added narrative zip. The biggest split is the one in which the viewer would assume they\u2019d have the least investment, because you\u2019ve been encouraged to eyeroll at its casualty. Lee (Barbara Hershey, incredibly raw and luminous throughout) has spent her first hotel room afternoon with Elliot, the besotted accountant played by Michael Caine and \u2013 unhappily, he says \u2013 still married to her sister, Hannah (Mia Farrow). Lee returns to the loft she shares with Frederick (Max von Sydow), an intolerant and intellectually superior artist many years her elder. He tells her about a Holocaust documentary he\u2019s been watching, in a long monologue von Sydow wholly inhabits, despite it being pure Allen at his most miserablist. Suffocated, Lee says she needs to move out, that that was always inevitable. Frederick guesses the truth \u2013 or part of it, at least. And he\u2019s wracked: with grief, with anger at her, and most of all frustration at himself. It\u2019s two long takes, with one discreet edit. And it\u2019s just virtuosic. The odious snob becomes a sympathetic victim. Lee\u2019s reasons, even without Elliot, are completely sound, yet for the first time, you sense her decision might not be right. Even the most ploddingly obvious breakups can come suddenly; the viewer is slapped with this truth almost as hard as Frederick. Hannah and Her Sisters is a movie of extraordinarily acute emotional intelligence, especially about female feelings. It\u2019s also one of Allen\u2019s warmest and funniest. This scene is sober, perfect and unshakable. CS"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
