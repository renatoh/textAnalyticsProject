I couldn't afford to live in London on what I earned as a novelist any more, and living in China has been a lifelong ambition of mine. So I bought a one-way plane ticket, a travel guide and a suitcase, and got myself a 90-day tourist visa. When that ran out, I planned to fly to Hong Kong and get it renewed, or buy a six-month business visa from a visa agent in Beijing. I wasn't entirely certain whether this was legal, but the agents didn't seem to care. I didn't expect getting permission to stay to be a problem back then, as I'd heard visas were easy to obtain. My family were bemused. My dad joked about me joining the Red Guards and being sent to a re-education camp. I promised not to try any herbal medicines or practise Falun Gong. My mum is Chinese Malaysian - her father emigrated from China to Malaysia in the 40s and she moved to Britain in 1969. She didn't understand why I wanted to live in China. My family in Malaysia go on organised tours to the motherland, with coach trips to temples and cultural relics. Why didn't I want to do the same? Why follow the chain of immigration backwards to a developing country? Still, a month later I arrived at Beijing Capital Airport, jetlagged and euphoric, my possessions scaled down to the 22kg airline luggage allowance. I moved into a friend's vacant apartment in a run-down building by the third ring road. The deposit and six months' rent in advance was less than one month's rent in London, which meant I could get by on my savings for a year before having to get a job. In the first weeks I explored the city by bus, choosing routes at random. Beijing is a city in flux and an exhilarating place to be. I love the sci-fi landscape of the Central Business District, the shiny metallic skyscrapers impaling the clouds. On the ring-road overpass by my flat you can lean over the exhaust-blackened railings and see 12 lanes of traffic speeding beneath you. Half of Beijing is a construction site: workmen scaling buildings caged in scaffolding, the swing of wrecking balls and rumble of pneumatic drills a kind of pre-Olympics anthem. The air quality is terrible here - there are days when visibility is so poor buildings 50 metres away are like faded apparitions. But I soon became used to the dust irritating my eyes, to seeing the sun haloed with smog and dimmed so pale you can stare directly at it without damaging your retinas. Within days I realised the Chinese I had learned in Britain wasn't Chinese at all, because I neglected to learn tones, which are integral to Chinese speech. When I thought I was asking a passer-by for directions to the internet cafe, I was actually calling him a \"son of a turtle\". When I said, \"I've caught a cold,\" others heard, \"I have sex with cats.\" At parties where hardly anyone spoke English, I'd smile a lot as the other guests had animated conversations around me. Because I was illiterate as well as mute, I'd choose dishes in restaurants by pointing at the photos in the menu. When there were no photos, I'd point to dishes at random and end up with a plate of stir-fried pig's intestines. During trips to the local supermarket I'd wander the aisle, lassoing shop assistants with my helplessness. I became a mime artist to describe what I was looking for, using an invisible knife to spread invisible butter on invisible bread. I shopped by a process of trial and error, discovering in my kitchen that what I thought was sunflower oil was actually vinegar, and what I mistook for flour was powdered rice. Once I cracked an egg on the edge of a frying pan and discovered it was boiled. Simple things like answering a knock at the door could be perplexing. Sometimes I'd open the door to people with clipboards, who'd deliver sales pitches at breakneck speed, before noticing my mute incomprehension, apologising and backing away. Once it was the man who lives in the flat directly beneath me shouting and jabbing his finger at my chest. What was he trying to tell me? That my pipes were leaking? That my ceiling was collapsing? Another time it was a stranger who smiled and held up a laminated card on a cord around his neck. He was wearing a tie and looked official, so I let him in. He took two see-through plastic socks out of his pocket and pulled them over his shoes. \"So as not to dirty my floor?\" I wondered. \"So as not to splatter his nice leather shoes with my blood as he bludgeons my skull with a lead pipe?\" He went to the kitchen and read the water meter. When he left I shut the door behind him, and felt very foolish as my heart beat decelerated. After a summer in Beijing I enrolled on an intensive language course: four hours a day, five days a week in a classroom, then several hours after school practising writing Chinese characters in an A4 notepad. After two months of language school, I became semi-literate. I discovered what the businesses once shrouded in mystery actually were. That the shady-looking establishments at the end of my road were not a gambling den and the local gangsters' HQ, but a key-cutters and travel agents. How disappointingly ordinary! There are 16 million people living in Beijing, but the expat community is very small. I keep bumping into the same foreigners at bookshops, bars and restaurants. When expats get together we tend to make vast generalisations about China and complain. This is understandable, as many western cultural values are turned on their head here. Generalising is a way of making sense of things, and people have a lot of frustrations to vent. But rather than creating a support network, I find the negativity brings me down. So the people that I am closest to here are Chinese. With my new limited language ability I have befriended my neighbour, a woman in her 60s. She lives with her 80-year-old mother and a fierce little dog called Wei Wei, who growls and struts about shaking a maimed teddy bear in her jaws. I drink tea in their living room on Sunday evenings, as Peking opera singers warble on the TV in the background. When I told my neighbour that I am half Chinese, that my mother is Chinese Malaysian, she shook her head and told me, firmly but kindly, that my mother is not Chinese. She wasn't born in China, so how can she be? My neighbour, who was born in Shandong province, worked in a canning factory during the cultural revolution. She graduated from university at 30 and worked for an accountancy firm. She has a 27-year-old daughter who lives with her biker husband and has many multi-coloured tattoos. When I asked her if she is bitter that her only education between the ages of 16 and 26 was studying the catechisms of Chairman Mao, she smiled and said: \"Why are you foreigners so obsessed with the cultural revolution? Look at Beijing now - what a city it has become! And the Olympics are coming this year! Why aren't you married? Twenty-nine is a bit old to be single, isn't it?\" She insisted that I teach her some English swearwords. Now she and her mother know a wide range of profanities. Her 80-year-old mother shrieks, \"Motherfucking son of a bitch!\" every time the dog rears up on its hind legs and pokes its nose in the dustbin, and I am very proud of her pronunciation. Last month I found out that the Chinese government has changed its visa regulations: it wants to remove superfluous foreigners from Beijing before the Olympics, probably because it's worried about Free Tibet protests. All business visas will expire on July 1, regardless of when they were issued, and tourist visas are now limited to 30 days - which means I may have to make a visa run to Hong Kong once a month. At the moment I am very confused about whether I can stay here for the Olympics or will have to leave and come back afterwards when the visa regulations are back to normal. Emigrating here has not been as easy as I thought it would be. That I may have to leave soon is a real disappointment, because after nearly a year here, Beijing is not nearly as bewildering as it used to be. I go to the supermarket and return home with exactly what I need. I hear the weather report and know it is going to rain. I answer the phone and know the recorded message is telling me to pay the phone bill. I know the names of my neighbours, their only children and government-regulation 35cm-high one-dog-policy dogs. I've become used to 24-hour construction sites, to skyscrapers mushrooming overnight, to staring up at the sky and not knowing where the pollution ends and the clouds begin. The tasks that used to be complicated, such as calling a repair man, ordering food, haggling in the market, I now do unthinkingly. The transition happened gradually, without me even noticing. But now I have, and though I still have a long way to go, things are finally going OK. \u00b7 Susan Barker's new novel, The Orientalist and the Ghost, is published by Doubleday. \u00b7 Do you have a story to tell about your life?
