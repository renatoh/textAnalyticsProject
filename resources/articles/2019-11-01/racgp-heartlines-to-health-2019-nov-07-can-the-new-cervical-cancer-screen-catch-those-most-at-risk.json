Medical developments have made the test much more accurate, and testing less frequent - which may help those most at risk. Pap smears, the tests used from 1991 until the new screening was introduced in 2017, are at best a nuisance, at worst a traumatic ordeal. For many, that has meant foregoing them altogether. Only six out of 10 Australian women test at the required interval of every two years. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people, those from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, and the economically disadvantaged are overrepresented in the number that don\u2019t test. This has real consequences for those individuals. More than 80% of cervical cancer occurs in people who aren\u2019t screened regularly or at all, and therefore aren\u2019t warned early enough to prevent cancer developing. DIY makes testing an option for more people People can administer the new cervical screening test themselves, providing a more acceptable option for women, nonbinary or transgender people who don\u2019t currently test and are most at risk. Cervical screening is a very intimate procedure. A speculum is inserted into the vagina and used to widen the opening, allowing the doctor or nurse to take a sample of cells from the cervix, which sits at the neck of the uterus. If you feel uncomfortable, you\u2019re not alone. Dr Lara Roeske, a spokeswoman for the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP), says it can be overwhelming for some. \u201cFear, embarrassment, pain, or the perception of pain, are big barriers to getting tested,\u201d she says. Also, cultural sensitivities, a history of abuse, trauma, and discrimination experienced by women and LGBTQI people can make what is an already a potentially difficult experience much worse. \u201cThat\u2019s not a small group,\u201d says Dr Roeske, a co-author of the National Cervical Screening Program guidelines. With the help of detailed instructions, people can perform the test alone, in a private room, at their GP or family planning clinic (it can\u2019t be taken home).

If you haven\u2019t heard of it, ask your GP Self-collection has been an option for Australians since December 2017. Anyone over the age of 30 who is not experiencing symptoms, is not pregnant, and whose last screening was meant to happen more than two years ago is eligible. Research has proved that the self-collection test is as good as a test done by a doctor or nurse. The evidence shows that the new test is something women want, with more than 85% of participants in an Australian pilot program taking it up when it was offered. But there\u2019s still a surprising lack of general awareness. \u201cWe would love more people to know about it and to talk to their GP or nurse about whether they\u2019re eligible for self-collection,\u201d says Dr Roeske, adding that GPs conduct more than 85% of cervical screening in Australia. \u201cThey\u2019re a really powerful voice in getting women to participate. \u201cIf you decline the speculum exam, for whatever reason, your doctor or nurse can support you and explain how to take the test. It\u2019s a life-saving pathway and it\u2019s about access and equity. Those who don\u2019t test for a whole host of reasons now have an option.\u201d Safer than ever, more accurate and less often The new cervical screening test only needs to be done every five years, from the age of 25 until the age of 70-74. RACGP president Dr Harry Nespolon says: \u201cIt\u2019s a better test done less often. And telling a woman she will only need to be tested every five years has meant more patients are willing to be screened.\u201d The longer interval is possible because the new test looks for the human papilloma virus (HPV) strains that may eventually cause cervical cancer. The pap smear detects already existing abnormalities, and doctors need to make an educated assessment about the risk of cancer developing. Dr Roeske says: \u201cNow we\u2019re looking directly for cause, at the DNA of the HPV virus. That\u2019s the big difference. \u201cWe test specifically for 14 types of HPV known to be causal and contribute to over 93% of cervical cancer in Australia. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have any of those types, we can actually say your risk of developing cancer of the cervix or a significant lesion in the next five years after this test is extremely low. \u201cYou\u2019re safer at five years with an HPV test than at two years after a pap smear.\u201d The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) is Australia\u2019s largest professional general practice organisation - our mission is to improve the health and wellbeing of all people in Australia by supporting GPs, general practice registrars and medical students."}, "isHosted": false}}}
