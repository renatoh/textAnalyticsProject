Calluses mean work, and work means he can feed his family. Just a few years ago, the only homes being built in Bogot\u00e1 were the plastic-sheeted tin-roofed shacks of refugees fleeing the violence in Colombia's countryside. Today, luxury apartment buildings are rising up on nearly every street corner, enticing buyers with squash courts, club houses and heated pools in this chilly high Andean capital. Mr Mej\u00eda, a 27-year-old construction worker, hasn't finished on one site before he's already found work at another. \"The boom started about two years ago. Before that we had to scrape to get by - now there's no shortage of work,\" he said as he swept brick and concrete dust from the street in front of his current job site, where a five-storey building of luxury apartments is being built in Bogot\u00e1's posh Bella Suiza district. A square metre here goes for $1,600 (\u00a3880). The government of President Alvaro Uribe points to the construction boom as a tangible sign that the country's economy, once crippled by recession and low investor confidence, is making a robust turnaround thanks especially to the government's crackdown on leftist rebels which has eased the threat of extortion and kidnapping dramatically. At the same time, President Uribe has been negotiating the demobilisation of rightwing paramilitary forces whose leaders often double as the heads of the new drug cartels in Colombia, the world's largest supplier of cocaine. Few Colombians are willing to speculate publicly about the coincidence of the construction boom and a huge influx of dollars into the economy coming at the same time as the paramilitaries-cum-drug lords are trying to clean up their act. But privately they wonder if they are moving back to the heady days of Colombia's narco-economy, when the big drug cartels laundered their millions through construction, and their dollar stockpiles helped keep the country out of the Latin American economic crashes of the 1980s and early 90s. Once the old-style cartels were dismantled, the Colombian economy tumbled. 'You don't see the same kind of narco-palaces going up that we used to see, but this does remind me of that time,\" said Mar\u00eda Pab\u00f3n, 42, as she strolled down a bustling pedestrian street lined with pubs and speciality restaurants in an area of Bogot\u00e1 known as the Zona Rosa. \"You have to wonder, though, where all the money is coming from for so many new buildings when the economy isn't doing all that well. There seems to be something illegal happening but nobody says anything.\" While internal refugees continue to pour into the sprawling city slums from violence-torn provinces, another kind of refugee is also coming into the city. Immigration officials report a turnaround in the net outflow of Colombians from their homeland in the past two years. Many well-to-do Colombians are coming back from self-imposed exile in Europe and America, where they went to escape death threats from paramilitary forces, kidnapping attempts by leftist guerrillas, and the country's general economic malaise. Those who aren't ready to return are sending money home, fuelling the construction boom, according to the government. Officials are aware that illegal money could be filtering through the system of expat remittances but haven't found a way to monitor these cash movements without cutting off an important source of hard currency for the economy. Mr Mej\u00eda isn't troubled by the provenance of his salary. \"We don't care where the money comes from - all that's important is that we're working.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
