Henman beat Argentina's David Nalbandian 6-2, 6-7, 7-5, 6-3, a scoreline which hid incredible fluctuations, notably in the third set. \"I played some great tennis early on, but he took the wind out of my sails in the second set. The longer the match went on the slower and slower the conditions became, and the third set was crucial. I won the mental battle. I was not going to give in,\" said a mightily relieved Henman, who had lost both his previous matches against last year's beaten Wimbledon finalist. \"The crowd were phenomenal at the end,\" he added. \"The last four games the atmosphere was absolutely incredible.\" The first set could scarcely have gone better for Henman, who won it with almost indecent ease in 32 minutes of measured tennis during which he broke the Argentinian's serve twice. As an indicator of what was about to unfold it was about as reliable as a long- range weather forecast. Nalbandian is a heavy man but exceptionally quick and with a mighty forehand. But during that first half-hour his mind must have inevitably slipped back to last year's final, his only previous match on Centre Court, when he was unable to find the least semblance of rhythm against Lleyton Hewitt and lost tamely. Midway through the open ing set Henman lifted a moribund bumble bee off the grass and carried it carefully away to the back of the court. Nalbandian probably felt a little like the bee at the end of the set - unable to move and with no sting. A double fault right at the beginning of the second set sent a sudden chill through Henman watchers, who have long realised that their man is often most vulnerable when he is ahead. But he held his serve safely, and then a double fault by the Argentinian in the fourth game set Henman up for a 3-1 lead. Nalbandian closed his eyes, bit his lower lip and lifted his shoulders in a long shuddering sigh. Everything was going wrong for the man from Cordoba, with no obvious sign that he was about to rectify matters. But even as he expelled the air from his lungs, the Henman Wimbledon roller coaster - that whitest of white-knuckle rides - was about to take its first stomach-lurching plunge. Henman dropped his serve, Nalbandian sharply grunting encouragement to himself after gleefully belting a backhand service return beyond him for 3-2. At 30-30 came news via the radio that Andre Agassi had lost and, as if picking up some telepathic signal, Henman made a forehand volley winner to set up another break point. Then, with the court wide open and a 4-2 lead in the making, Henman missed a seemingly easy forehand. It was not a gift that Nalbandian was about to pass up, and the second set eventually went to a tie-break which the No6 seed won 7-4. It was a close-run thing, the telling moment coming at 4-3 when Nalbandian, stretching hard to his right, managed to get his forehand to a 120mph first serve, the ball arcing in an unplayable parabola past a startled Henman and dropping plumb on the line. What happened in the third set was hardly credible. Suc cessive service breaks are as common as muck in the women's game but a relative rarity in men's matches. Yet there were no fewer than six consecutive breaks, and seven in total, as Henman and Nalbandian vied with each other in the \"After you, David - no, after you, Tim\" brand of nerve-racking tennis. Nalbandian's serve is not exactly powder puff but it is his least decisive weapon. In this respect he is almost accustomed to losing it, and does not let it worry him unduly. Henman, on the other hand, knows that if his serve gets the shakes then the rest of his game is likely to turn to jelly. He simply could not believe what was happening to him, although Nalbandian has a quality of return that can surprise the best, and everybody other than Hewitt here last year. Having served for the third set and failed, Henman had a second chance and this time he took it, dragging his fastest serve of 126mph from the depths when it was most needed. Relief was written on every line of Henman's face, some of which had not seemed to be there at the start of that extraordinary third set. And the pattern was set. Nalbandian lost his serve at the start of the fourth set, only to break back three games later and level. But Henman's break to lead 4-3 was decisive, and he will return tomorrow to play either S\u00e9bastien Grosjean or Juan Carlos Ferrero, the French Open champion. Both men have recently conquered the British hope."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
