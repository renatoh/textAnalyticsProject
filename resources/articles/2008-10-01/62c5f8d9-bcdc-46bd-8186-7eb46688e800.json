But Bor doesn't tell him off or lecture him, he merely presses play on the DVD of Canadian stand-up Glenn Wool and resumes the lesson. \"Faggots,\" announces the DVD, \"fuck\", \"shit\". Coogan-Jobes and his classmates Henry Willmore and Umut Budak clearly aren't staying behind for detention or for extra lessons, they're here to learn about stand-up comedy. And for Coogan-Jobes, it's a spot of \u2013 heavily uncensored \u2013 careers advice too. London-based stand-up Joe Bor first encountered Coogan-Jobes two years ago when he was a teaching assistant giving him extra maths tuition at Acland Burghley comprehensive school in London's Tufnell Park. Says Bor, \"He wasn't badly behaved but he did seem to want to talk more about comedy than maths. After finding out that I was a comedian part-time, he and a few other students kept asking me to tell jokes and I would say, 'When you answer four questions then I'll tell you a joke.'\" Eventually Bor got the go-ahead to run an after-school club for budding stand-up comics and so Coogan-Jobes' interest was piqued and, with Bor's help, he began writing his own material. At the end of his GCSEs Coogan-Jobes was \"booked\" to play for ten minutes his leavers ball in March. \"My first joke was something to do with a girlfriend and from there Joe helped me build the character up,\" says Coogan-Jobes, a sweet, soft-spoken boy, \"I used to have loads of jokes that Joe would tell me were rubbish. He's probably using them in his set\u2026.\" Coogan-Jobes' material is very personal, based on being at school, being bullied and being overweight. \"It's all real,\" he says, \"but my character is exaggerated. I don't put myself down that much in everyday life.\" This year at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, Bor had enough faith in Coogan-Jobes to let him loose on his own audiences with a ten-minute open spot which saw him win the audiences over with material about school obesity classes, not getting a girlfriend and eating cake at Weightwatchers. Now, just eight gigs later, Coogan-Jobes has got the bug good and proper. Studying for A-levels in history, media studies, politics and sociology, Coogan-Jobes sees his future as a stand-up: \"Hopefully. You have to see how it goes\u2026you never know.\" Says Bor, \"Liam was very shy when I first met him and he really lacked confidence, but since doing stand up he seems to have become a completely different person. He seems really passionate about it and really knows his stuff. He's got the ingredients to do very well, I think.\" Bor (pictured left), who runs his own monthly club Laugh and a Half at the Dartmouth Arms in Tufnell Park, and is a member of sketch troupe the Gadabouts, is now a full-time stand-up. But the comedy workshops are still important to him so he keeps his hand in, tackling subjects such as stage presence, gag structure, call-backs, image and heckling in weekly hour-long sessions. Head of drama Rachel Board mock-sighs and rolls her eyes, \"We call it 'boys' club' and sit here listening to their willy jokes through the wall.\" The Comedy School in nearby Camden has long recognised the social benefits of stand-up. It runs arts and issue-based projects with young people in schools, youth centres and prisons in collaboration with local London boroughs and the Metropolitan Police and runs summer comedy programmes for 16-20-year-olds. Bor is in no doubt about the transformative power of comedy. \"Seeing Liam at the leaving do was one of the most amazing things I have ever seen. I thought it would be social suicide for him but people were laughing constantly throughout the whole thing. I feel like this has made such a difference to him.\" Back at Acland Burghley and we are learning about stage presence. Bor asks the boys what they note about Wool's delivery. \"He's probably one of the most charismatic comics on the circuit,\" he says, \"but why do we like him?\" \"He finds the ridiculous in life,\" notes Coogan-Jobes, insightfully \"yet the things he's talking about are quite controversial. Like religion and gay-bashing.\" \"What do we note about his appearance?\" asks Bor, \"His look matches his accent,\" says Willmore. Cue a discussion about Bor's own stage attire. \"Yeah, that white tie you wear doesn't work,\" says Coogan-Jobes. \"Cheers man,\" sighs Bor. We have a bash at some joke writing and Bor asks the class to think of some adverts that they find ridiculous. \"People who put their own personal adverts on the front of cars for personal training,\" says Coogan-Jobes, \"The Cartridge-World advert,\" ventures Budak. There is palpable camaraderie among the boys in this group, who laugh at each other's jokes and listen carefully to each other, something Coogan-Jobes may not have seen if he hadn't discovered he could make people laugh. \"There is real support in the comedy world,\" he says, \"People are always keen to help and see you do well.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
