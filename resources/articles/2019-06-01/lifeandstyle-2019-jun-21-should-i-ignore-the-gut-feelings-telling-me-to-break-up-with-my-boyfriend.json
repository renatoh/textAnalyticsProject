I\u2019ve swung between thinking we should break up, and convincing myself we can make it work and that my gut feeling of uncertainty stems from my own issues. While we have our problems, we are willing to work through them, and he is by far the best partner I have had in many ways. There is no reason to believe that we can\u2019t overcome our difficulties (except perhaps that we haven\u2019t yet, despite counselling), so I don\u2019t know why I feel this way. Has anyone ignored their instincts and put in the effort to improve the relationship with positive results? \u2022 When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Private Lives asking for help, and may well view your comments here.
