Fulham played their part in an entertaining match in Turin last night but David Trezeguet's goal just as half-time beckoned means the Premier League club have a two-goal deficit to overturn. The task is not impossible and the crucial away goal that Dickson Etuhu grabbed earlier in the first half means Fulham are not entirely without hope but Juventus, and in particular the irrepressible Trezeguet, caused enough problems going forward to suggest keeping a clean sheet will be a tall order for Hodgson's team next week. The Fulham manager certainly knows that his side will have to defend better than they did in the opening 25 minutes here, when Juventus raced into a two-goal lead. At that point Fulham looked as if they were facing an exercise in damage limitation but, to their credit, they came back into the game and pilfered a fortunate goal when Etuhu's shot left the former Arsenal goalkeeper Alex Manninger wrong-footed after taking a wicked deflection. Three presentable chances came and went in the five-minute period before the break and the failure to take one of them was punished when Trezeguet registered his 170th goal in Juventus colours. It was a moment that Hodgson was still cursing afterwards as he reflected on the concession that \"killed the game\" for Fulham. \"Our major regret was that at 2-1, when the possibility of a result was in our hands, we conceded a goal in added time in the first half,\" said Fulham's manager. \"But we're not out of it yet. I've certainly seen stranger things happen in my career than us turning it around.\" Fulham will have to begin much more brightly in the return leg. Juventus's opening goal came after nine minutes when Nicola Legrottaglie made the most of the time and space that Fulham afforded him to head Diego's corner powerfully into the net from about 10 yards. It was the worst possible start for Fulham and Juventus's early dominance would soon be rewarded with a second goal. Again Fulham contributed to their own downfall as Simon Davies and Etuhu allowed Jonathan Zebina to dart between them. Thereafter, however, it was impossible to ignore the quality of the finish as the full-back fired a wonderful 25-yard shot from wide on the right past Mark Schwarzer and into the far corner. Fulham were hanging on but Etuhu's goal changed the complexion of the tie for a period. Suddenly Fulham began to play with more belief and Brede Hangeland, Bobby Zamora and Zoltan Gera all troubled Manninger in quick succession before Trezeguet, who had earlier forced a fine save from Schwarzer with a glancing header, showed lightning reactions to volley home after his first shot cannoned off the upright. Diego might have added a fourth for Juventus in the closing seconds but that would have been harsh on a Fulham side whose disappointment at the final whistle provided a measure of how far the club has come under Hodgson."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
