Felice Belloli, who was speaking during a meeting to discuss funding in women\u2019s football, was forced to resign as head of the National Amateur League after his comments unleashed a torrent of criticism in Italy and beyond. Coupled with the national team\u2019s fourth consecutive failure to reach a World Cup finals which got underway in Canada a few weeks later, the episode signalled the lowest ebb for women\u2019s football in a country where in the 1970s and 80s it had enjoyed increasing popularity. But it also marked a turning point after propelling Milena Bertolini, the current coach of the women\u2019s national team, to put her head above the parapet. Bertolini, who at the time was president of the Reggio Emilia Foundation of Sport, edited a book called \u201cGiocare con le tette\u201d (\u201cPlaying with tits\u201d). The bold title caused embarrassment and the book was mostly ignored by the media but its publication in the wake of the debacle broke the silence on sexism within football, forcing the higher echelons of the Italian Football Federation (Figc) to take note while challenging stereotypes across wider Italian society. \u201cThis book anticipated the times ahead,\u201d Bertolini tells the Guardian. \u201cIt was provocative but useful in getting us to where we are today.\u201d Italian women\u2019s football is in the midst of a revival after Bertolini led the team to its first World Cup in 20 years and a quarter-final meeting with the Netherlands in Valenciennes on Saturday. As the women progressed through the group stage, excitement built at home. Sky Sports Italy secured non-exclusive rights to broadcast the tournament while Italy\u2019s first match against Australia was also aired on the terrestrial Rai 2. The team\u2019s victory encouraged the state-owned broadcaster to shift the next match against Brazil to its main channel, Rai 1. It was the first time a women\u2019s game had been transmitted on Rai 1 in the channel\u2019s history and attracted over six million viewers. \u201cWinning helps, as it attracts more interest and the media is more attentive,\u201d says Bertolini. \u201cBut at the end of the day people are beginning to appreciate the women\u2019s game. I said in the book that women would save football as the men\u2019s game was becoming unwatchable, with all the protests and little enjoyment. With women it\u2019s different. They play to win but with correctness, joy and fair play.\u201d Stefano, who has been televising the games from his bar in central Rome, agrees: \u201cIt\u2019s much cleaner play, free of the idiocy you see in a men\u2019s game. People haven\u2019t specifically come in for the matches but, when they see that they\u2019re on, they stay to watch \u2013 initially out of curiosity, then enjoyment. It\u2019s wonderful to watch, especially after the hurt caused by the men failing to get to their last World Cup.\u201d The history of women\u2019s football in Italy has been strewn with highs and lows. The first team was established in the 1930s and again after the second world war. But it was not until 1968 that the first women\u2019s federation was created by a group of businessmen. Elisabetta Vignotto, a celebrated striker who scored 107 goals in 109 games with the national team, experienced the early highs of that period, performing at packed stadiums during the second unofficial women\u2019s World Cup in Mexico in 1971 (the first unofficial tournament having been held in Italy in 1970). \u201cIt was beautiful,\u201d said Vignotto. \u201cI was a girl of only 17 and to go there was an incredible experience. They put us up in the same hotel where the men\u2019s team were hosted [for the men\u2019s World Cup] the year before.\u201d Sonia Pessotto, another former player and coordinator of Figc\u2019s department for women\u2019s football, said that, while sexism was more accentuated in the past, it was mostly felt in the stadiums, with the women subjected to the typical cries of \u201cget back in the kitchen\u201d by male spectators. \u201cCivil society could not quite accept us playing football,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the managers and coaches were always very supportive. They believed in it.\u201d After a long lull, the women\u2019s game finally regained prominence following a requirement for the top men\u2019s clubs to have a women\u2019s team. Then came the World Cup qualification in 2018, while the 2018-19 Serie A campaign was the first to be organised by Figc. In a further sign of growing interest among spectators, Juventus Women\u2019s first game at the club\u2019s Allianz Stadium in March was a sell-out. However, there is still a long way to go when it comes to pay. Unlike the multimillion-euro contracts enjoyed by their male counterparts, the women are still considered amateur athletes and many who play for middle-tier clubs are unpaid, forcing them to work other jobs. Their amateur status also exempts them from contributions towards social benefits, such as healthcare and pensions. Giusy Versace, a Paralympic athlete and parliamentarian, is battling to change this. \u201cThey are women who have been able to train and reach this level thanks to thoughtful sponsors and their own pockets, not to the state,\u201d she said. \u201cNow that women\u2019s football is generating chatter, the time is right to change the law.\u201d On top of this Bertolini also hopes that the World Cup will inspire more women to take up football. She said there has been an increase in recent years, with 23,000 women, including girls signed up to football schools, playing. \u201cBut it\u2019s still very small compared to England, France or the Netherlands. My dream is that we reach 100,000.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
