I will fight! I will fight!! Until I take my last breath!\" And Kipling no less. That was a very Serbian presentation. I'm half Serb by heritage, so I'm allowed to say it. Serbs love being under attack and scorned. It merely reinforces for them how correct they are. They love a fight, they have long memories and they like revenge. Remember, these are a people whose great national holiday. St. Vitus's Day, commemorates something that happened 600 years ago -- and that something was not a great military victory, but a defeat! My Dad was one of the most enlightened and liberal and gentle men you could ever know, except for two things. One, he had a temper. And two, if you got him talking about the Turks, he'd suddenly start sounding like Curtis LeMay. It would have been helpful if he'd mentioned whether he still intends to appoint a senator."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
