A hyperactive Ethan Hawke plays Lars Nystrom, a mustachioed, bewigged, leather-jacketed ex-convict who bustles into the Kreditbanken with a machine gun, demanding one million US dollars and \u201ca Mustang like Steve McQueen had in Bullitt\u201d in exchange for his hostage, bank teller Bianca Lind (Noomi Rapace). She falls for her daffy, inept captor; the term \u201cStockholm syndrome\u201d is invented. There\u2019s comedy in its depiction of the Swedish prime minister as a caricature of even-temperedness, but from its gaudy 70s costuming to its goofy, wobbling tone, everything about this film feels uncomfortably broad."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
