Liam Byrne, chief secretary to the Treasury and one of the party's leading thinkers, said the Tory leader's central case on combating poverty amounted to little more than the politics of \"crossing your fingers\". He was trying to rebut Cameron's Hugo Young lecture, delivered on Tuesday night. In a speech to the Institute of Governance, Byrne argued that Cameron had no guaranteed way of achieving his ideal of replacing Labour's \"big, insensitive state\" with a more active civic society looking after the public good. Both sides of the political divide accept that the battle of ideas over the future state, although abstract, could yet decide the next election. If Cameron can convince voters that his vision of the state as a catalyst of a stronger civil society is not code for 21st-century Thatcherism, he may win a vital tranche of middle Britain that is still sceptical about his party, if not him. In a key passage, the Tory leader argued that the role of the state is galvanising, catalysing, prompting, encouraging and agitating for community engagement and social renewal. It must help families, individuals, charities and communities come together to solve problems. He said: \"We must use the state to remake society.\" There are clear dividing lines emerging in the approaches of the main parties: Labour is considering a manifesto pledge to turn institutions such as schools and hospitals into mutualised co-ops where staff and local people have a real stake in improving services; the Tories are experimenting with an \"easyCouncil\", no-frills, easyJet-style approach to council services in outrider authorities such as Barnet, where a basic level of service is provided, with extras available to those prepared to pay more. Cameron's claim that Labour has squeezed out kindness prompted a detailed rebuttal from Byrne, who first challenged the Tory leader on his accusation that Labour had stifled civic society. He said: \"Cameron argues that government has crowded out civil society. \"But that flies in the face of all the evidence showing how the third sector has flourished under Labour. He wishes it were true because he likes to pretend there's a trade-off between state and society. He thinks more of one means less of another. Yet the opposite is true. The state and society aren't alternatives. They're partners.\" Byrne refused to cede ground to the Conservatives, saying: \"The number of charities has grown by nearly 40%. Their income has more than doubled. Volunteering and giving are up. Levels of trust are high. This is a strength we can draw on in the years ahead.\" He said: \"If you want a strong society you need a fair society. And fair societies have a strong state. Compare for a moment Sweden and the US. In Sweden 60% think their fellow citizens can be trusted \u2013 in the US it's less than 40%. Cameron will struggle to identify a country in the world with a strong society and a weak state. Yet that's the experiment he offers for Britain.\" He claimed Cameron's case was no different from Conservative plans of the past that started by rolling back the state and ended by increasing spending on benefits and widening inequality. Byrne also argued that history on both sides of the Atlantic shows where the rolled-back society ultimately ends: in recession and huge payments to subsidise the unemployed. He said: \"The growth in inequality of the Tory years was among the steepest in the western world since the 1940s at a time when inequality was falling, not rising, among our European competitors.\" But less than three weeks ahead of the crucial pre-budget report, Byrne acknowledged that the state cannot remain the same in size or shape. He said: \"We were always to going to hit the point when spending growth had to slow \u2013 when the investment gap the Tories left us was fixed, when we not only reached international averages for spending on police and education and health, but exceeded them. And that point is now.\" The chief secretary also sent out a tough message to ministers in big-spending departments as negotiations over future budgets reach a climax. He said money could be saved by rationalising departments, selling assets and simplifying the landscape of public sector agencies. \"Where there are difficult decisions, we need to take them, not flinch from them. The right tough-minded balance on tax and spending was key to us winning trust in 1997. It is key to us winning trust in 2010. Because if we do not show that we are a party for all seasons, then quite simply, we won't be hired to work in all seasons.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
