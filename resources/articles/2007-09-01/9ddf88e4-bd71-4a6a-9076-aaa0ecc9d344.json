I'll drink to that", "bodyText": "It is important not to get too aggrieved at what others think - water off a duck's back, better to be talked about than not talked about, etcetera - but during the Edinburgh Festival it's hard not to bridle a little. Take Roy Hattersley, a welcome brother soldier in the battle to defend the Union. Last week, he offered his views on the arts in Scotland, at least after he had complained about being banned from taking Buster, his faithful friend, to visit the statue of Abraham Lincoln in the Calton burial ground. This, he fumed, in the city of Greyfriar's Bobby. He raised the issue of a play he saw a couple of years ago at the Traverse - I'm guessing Martin J Taylor's East Coast Chicken Supper - where blokes sat around 'swearing a lot and drinking beer from cans'. That is why Scotland will never be free, he suggested, because in our art we hark back to the last time we got pissed, rather than some fabulous time in our history. Where, he asked, was the Scottish equivalent of Yeats's The Celtic Twilight 'Blimey,' as one blogger said. It's true that Scottish nationalism was, originally, a romantic movement before it became about 'Scotland's oil'. The prime movers, such as Hugh Macdiarmid, were driven by similar urges to Yeats, as Rosemary Goring's forthcoming Scotland, the Autobiography, shows. The book opens with a Macdiarmid epigraph. 'Scotland small? Our multiform, our infinite Scotland small? Only as a patch of hillside may be a cliche corner/To a fool who cries \"Nothing but heather!\".' Quite right, Only an Englisher would miss, among the stems, the hairy caterpillars, long black slugs and wee bit of grouse poo. But the drink! It appears that Londoners are baffled by our artistic yearnings. Goring, wonderfully, reprints Hattersley's fellow columnist, Simon Jenkins as he attacks the 'literary vandalism' of James Kelman winning the 1994 Booker, the only time a Scot brought the award north. Jenkins is his usual witty self, wondering why Kelman's drunk and blind Glaswegian is such a hero. Reading Goring's book, which I recommend, you do see the outsiders' point. If our history isn't entwined with our relationship with booze, then it's caught up in religion (with the occasional exception for genius and incest). Early on, there is a drunken King Kenneth getting his comeuppance after being rude about England's King Edgar. Later, a woman called Mary Macintosh is being sold in Edinburgh's Grassmarket for 'Drunkenness and Adultery'. This scene bears repeating at some length. A Highlander and a tinker had just made their bid: 'At this time, one of the Killarney pig jobbers, with his mouth open as wide as a turnpike gate, and half-drunk, cried loudly, FAUGHAHOLLICE, and I will give you two shillings more, for she is a pretty woman. A Brogue maker, from Newry, coming out of a public house, as drunk as 50 cats in a wallet, came up to the Killarney man, and hits him in the bread bay, and he lay there for the space of ten minutes, which made the woman for sale laugh heartily.' That was in 1828. Are we surprised that visitors recoil? And so it goes ... drunk after drunk after religious bigot after David Hume after drunk. Bless the good people of Edinburgh. They used to get grumpy about nudity on the Edinburgh stage, but drunkenness? No problem. Booze flows, from Whisky Galore to AL Kennedy's Paradise (although, to be fair, hers is an indictment). My favourite line of late is from Kevin MacNeil's The Stornoway Way: '[This is] the only place where the birds are woken by the sound of drunks singing.' So it goes. Perhaps it's time for a new Scottish dance, the 12-step."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
