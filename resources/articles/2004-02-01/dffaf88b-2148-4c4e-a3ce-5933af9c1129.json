Having seen his new team show more spirit in 45 stirring minutes than they had shown in their previous 10 matches put together, Kinnear rounded on his critics past and present in a gloriously wilful diatribe that - ironically, because it was intended to do the opposite - summoned up memories of the man whose legacy hangs over the City Ground like a suffocating blanket. \"It's a hard club to come to for players because from the moment you walk into the place you get the history rammed down your throat day in day out,\" said Kinnear, after analysing a performance that saw Forest come back from 1-3 at half-time to take a deserved point with an injury-time equaliser from the late substitute Gareth Taylor. \"It's a pain in the arse but you have to live with it. You can't break wind without names like [Brian] Clough and [former player turned local media pundit Garry] Birtles being mentioned.\" And then he really got into his stride. \"I know all the crap about winning the European Cup but the people who hang around the club pontificating haven't had the guts to become managers or, if they have, they've failed. People criticise me, say I'm a route-one manager, but it's always the same- if Robert Pires threads a 20- or 30-yard ball inside the full-back for Thierry Henry to run on to and score it's a brilliant pass but, when my teams do it, it's a boot down the middle.\" There was much more in the same vein, much of it justified, as Kinnear harked back to his long spell in charge at Wimbledon. His point, just about decipherable through the obscenities, was that, while it might be aesthetically pleasing, making 15 or 20 passes in midfield was not much use if there was no end-product. \"We're a good passing side and no one's going to take that away, irrespective of what's been said, but I want to see a result,\" said Kinnear. Encouraging the players to be more direct got exactly that as, having failed to score in their previous seven league games, Forest were up in three minutes through the loan signing Andy Impey on his debut. But Walsall, hard working and intelligent on the break, exploited three individual errors to go in well clear at the break. Kinnear told them \"to show some bollocks\" and, assuming he meant courage and skill, that is exactly what they did, roaring back so effectively that Walsall barely crossed the halfway line in the second period as Forest laid siege to James Walker's goal. Marlon King's goal, his first in the 11 league games he has played for Forest, raised the temperature nicely and Taylor's header was almost sucked across the line by the delighted Trent End, whose reaction to Kinnear and the performance was such that it made the idea they might disdain his methods ludicrous. \"There were pluses and minuses but I saw enough to know we can avoid relegation, that's for sure,\" said Kinnear. \"We need a ball-winner; we're too nice in the middle of the park and we have to get the ball back quicker when we lose it. \"But a couple of key players like [centre-half] Michael Dawson and [striker] David Johnson aren't far away from being fit and, when everyone's available, there's a strong possibility we'll stay up.\" On this evidence, playing his way, he may be right - and that does not mean lumping it.
