But Whirlwind, an ambitious new work from Will Todd, is an exception. Alongside professional singers, it has found room for 50 homeless and formerly homeless people from Tyneside, who take an active part in every area of the production. Streetwise - The Opera (11am, Radio 4), follows them on their journey to the world premiere at the Sage, Gateshead. In tonight's instalment - the first of two - we hear their stories as the workshops begin in Newcastle and Gateshead. Meanwhile in London, an unlikely cast of young homeless people and corporate lawyers is working on a new version of Carmen - Carmen Electric - with rap, street dance, and a live DJ. Elsewhere, two music moguls are slugging it out to see who's got the most impressive record collection. 6 Mix (10pm, 6 Music) pits Tony Wilson, the founder of Factory Records, against Alan McGee, the man who gave us Creation. Who's your money on: Wilson, whose artists included the Happy Mondays, Joy Division and New Order, or McGee, with Primal Scream and Dirty Pretty Things?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
