Watching it is like eating something silky or entering those few endless moments of total relaxation before you fall asleep. And if that doesn't sound exciting, well, it's not. It's beautiful. And intense. Sophisticated but tantalisingly human. The precision qualities of Ballet Freiburg Pretty Ugly's dancers and the live Bach quintet selected from the Freiburg Baroque Orchestra come together like a meeting of old friends. Nine dancers perform within a flat white rectangle that juts into the audience at an angle. Those in the raked seating to the back can watch the audience watching the dancers who watch the musicians who watch them back. There is an easy attitude about the whole cycle. The performers could be meeting at the gym or in the park. And we are there with them. It is casual almost, as some dancers move and others wait to take their turn on the reserve benches or in the shadows. Yet there are strict boundaries at work here. Amanda Miller's elegant choreography, bending classical ballet into modern dance, folds and unfolds bodies in an exacting origami that reaches every corner and accounts for every finger, as Bach fills the rest of the space. The fugue is a repetitive and thoroughly calculated form, so what is striking about this performance is its capacity for tenderness. In the first act the dancers work through what seem like infinite variations. For the second, pas de deux, solos and ensemble pieces come to play. Throughout it all a cool concentration allows for warm engagements, and Miller has masterful control of such contradiction. The giant genetic-code backlighting that she uses for a solo subtly hints that we are all in this together, both by chance and by design. And when the piece stops abruptly mid-stream, you feel it could go on for ever. Miller is an American who has lived in Germany since the early 1980s. Her company, now permanently located in Freiburg Stadttheater, are a joyfully disciplined troupe, working with an equally urbane collection of musicians. It is to be hoped that Scottish Ballet scouts, now on the lookout for a new artistic director, were taking notes.
