Max Clifford", "bodyText": "I left school at 15 with no qualifications and I was soon sacked from my first job in a department store for being rude to the customers. Then, all I wanted to do was play sport and enjoy myself. Luckily, the sports editor of my local paper, the Merton and Morden News, got to know me and gave me the opportunity to report on water polo matches I was playing in around the country. When a vacancy for a trainee reporter came up I was handed it, through the back door. My love of music soon gave me the chance to write a records column for the group of newspapers, which also guaranteed I would receive stacks of free records. So, I used them to start a disco and I plugged the venue in the paper. After two years in the world of newspapers I left - although I am still a member of the NUJ - to cross into publicity, working for EMI Records. This began more than four decades of promoting, protecting and advising the world's biggest stars in entertainment. But in those days public relations was not as we know it today. An early task was being given an unknown Liverpudlian band to launch: the Beatles. Their global success introduced me to an array of media figures throughout the world very quickly. My boss Syd Gillingham gave me free rein in the job while promoting talent from Cliff Richard to the Bee Gees. Within a couple of years, Syd left EMI to form his own company - and I followed him there. But when he decided soon afterwards that he wanted to return to print journalism, this was my chance, at the age of 25, to crack the industry - solo. In reality, it was fairly easy establishing my own company because it was before the PR industry started to burgeon and luckily I had already built up several good accounts in my few years promoting the stars. Yet I never had to pitch for business then - or in fact at any time since. I never ever ask anyone to phone me with information and I never tout for business. It might sound glamorous, but PR has got to suit you. It is essential to have an interest in the media as well as understanding your clients' needs. The majority of my time is spent protecting clients rather than promoting them in the press. So life becomes a constant battle with the media, trying to outmanoeuvre them. And most significantly, if you look back over the past two decades, I have broken more major stories than any journalist in Britain. I have been behind exposes of scandals involving big names such as Jeffrey Archer and David Mellor. The stars, such as Simon Cowell, come to me. And I do the job on my terms, because, if you let them, stars are a real pain to work with. If they need you more than you need them, it's a wonderful job. But if it's the other way round, a PR man's job can be a nightmare. Fortunately, for me it's never been like that. There are very few people who do a job they love, but I am lucky to count myself among them. In the past 15 years, PR has become very glamorous and it is now one of the most popular degree courses and I sponsor a course in Bournemouth. My small team of nine have all taken degrees, but then it requires three or four years' experience until they become PR workers, because theory is one thing, but practice is a million miles away. Life in public relations is an adventure and I love it. I've never had a life plan and I intend to get away with it for as long as I can - it beats working for a living and I regard myself as being incredibly fortunate. People have described me as the most powerful man in Britain, yet I am only third in my own house, behind the dog! Over the years there have been countless people claiming they are going to be the next Max Clifford, but you should want to be original and do things your own way - that's how I have always carried out my job.
