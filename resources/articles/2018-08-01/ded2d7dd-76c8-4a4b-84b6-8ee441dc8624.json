Lowy announced his intention to quit on Friday in a move that will end his family\u2019s more than 50-year association with football in Australia. He told reporters that \u201cthe future is unclear\u201d for Australian football, as it faces a stalemate between the FFA board and the owners of A-League clubs. \u201cThe main purpose is to give the game every possible chance over the next couple of months to expand the [FFA] congress and at the same time preserve the independence of the FFA board,\u201d Lowy said. \u201cThe period ahead will be one of uncertainty and intense debate.\u201d For years, club owners have wanted an overhaul of how football is run, arguing for the A-League to be run independently of FFA, and an expanded congress that would grant them more power. In a bid to end the stalemate, Fifa brought in a \u201ccongress review working group\u201d in April, which this month mostly backed the club owners. The working group recommendations are to be voted on in September, but the FFA board oppose the move, and have the votes to block it. On Friday, Lowy said he hoped his exit would force the club owners back to the negotiation table. \u201cI wanted to remove myself from the debate so the stakeholders focus on the core issues at hand,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not about me, it\u2019s not about my dad [previous FFA chairman, Frank], it\u2019s not about my family. \u201cThere is a possible outcome that stakeholders take a step back and...agree on a compromise that delivers an expanded and balanced congress, charts a course for greater autonomy for an expanded A-League, but also retains a structure for an independent FFA board.\u201d He said the current structure recommended by the review would damage the grassroots game, and hand power to those with the most money. \u201cThe clubs want to take a larger share of the revenue from the game,\u201d he said. \u201cBy definition the national team and the grassroots will lose out. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t allow representation to be driven by money. We should not move to a model where the money flows back automatically to where it comes form. The governance model advocated by our critics leads to the trading of political favours between a few individuals who would control the many.\u201d If the recommendations are opposed on 7 September, Lowy said it would plunge the game into \u201ca stalemate and further uncertainty\u201d. Fifa has the power to sack the FFA board and replace it with a \u201cnormalisation committee\u201d, and to potentially suspend the national men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams from international competition. But Lowy said he believed he was \u201cshowing leadership\u201d and making the right decision by stepping down. He also fired parting shots at some of the A-League owners, including the City Football Group, owners of Melbourne City. \u201cWe welcome foreign investment in our league,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is more than welcome; it is crucial. But when it comes to the whole of the game, it should not be controlled by foreign interests. That is what is at stake here. \u201cTo those who are tired of the debate and wish for an outbreak of peace so that the game can get on with life, I say: be very careful what you wish for.\u201d Lowy, the son of previous FFA chairman Frank Lowy, said he left \u201cwith a heavy heart\u201d but believed he had left the domestic game in a better state. \u201cNo fair minded person could say that the game overall is not in a much stronger place than it was 15 years ago, or even a few years ago. We are now at a tipping point, the game could get stronger or it could break, if vested interests prevail.\u201d Lowy was elected unopposed as FFA chairman in November 2015, taking over from his father in a move that drew accusations of nepotism from opponents, such as former Adelaide United chairman Greg Griffin. Alongside FFA chief executive David Gallop, he oversaw the announcement of a record six-year broadcasting deal with Fox Sports in December 2016, worth $346m, and securing Caltex as a major naming rights sponsor for the Socceroos after Qantas opted not to renew its sponsorship."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
