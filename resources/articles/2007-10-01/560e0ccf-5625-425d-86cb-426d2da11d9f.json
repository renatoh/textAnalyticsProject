They have often been regarded as parasites, unable to create art themselves but capable of ruining reputations with the stroke of a poison pen. However, the critic has a vital role to play in culture and one that is under threat. When Samuel Beckett's play Waiting for Godot was first produced on the London stage in 1955, it was greeted with derision. Catcalls came from the early audiences and half the theatre emptied by the second act. But when favourable reviews appeared in the Sunday papers by the leading theatre critics Kenneth Tynan and Harold Hobson, the play was taken seriously. Waiting for Godot is now regarded as the most important play of the 20th century. Controversial artists have often been brought to a resistant public by prominent critics. Clement Greenberg did it for Jackson Pollock. John Ruskin did it for Turner. But are there now critics of sufficient authority to perform this role? Is this because we are all critics now? There has been a tremendous democratisation in response to the arts. It can be traced to the anti-authoritarian spirit of the late 1960s, when deference to tweedy academics seemed at odds with the age of Aquarius. But the idea that one opinion is as good as another has accelerated in recent years. If you want to know whether to read a book you can always look at the readers' feedback on Amazon, even if you are not a visitor to the innumerable blogs devoted to all forms of cultural output. Alongside the popular expansion of criticism, the academic study of the arts has become much more specialised and esoteric. The Cambridge don F R Leavis, the leading British literary critic of the 20th century, sought to preach to the widest possible audience because he regarded High Culture as the modern world's only hope. Now academics are content to speak to each other in technical language, published in small-circulation journals. At a literature conference these days you are much more likely to hear about hegemonic discourses than about the aesthetic merits of a writer. The popular widening of criticism and its academic contraction might seem opposites but are in fact symptoms of the same assumption: that artistic value is simply a question of personal taste. The critic-as-instructor, as objective judge and expert, has yielded to the critic who shares personal reactions and subjective enthusiasms. The bloggers and reading groups often claim that they would rather get recommendations from someone they know, someone with similar tastes. One problem with this is that the public are relying on a reviewing system that confirms and assuages their prejudices rather than challenges them. An able and experienced critic, with sufficient authority, could once persuade readers to give unfamiliar work a second chance, to see things they did not see at first glance. In that respect, critics can be the harbingers of the new. Can we rely on the bloggers to bring vital if alienating art to a wide audience? The conviction that educated taste is an elitist ruse, that one opinion is as good as another, and that we should take our lead for our cultural life solely from people like us might seem like an instance of \"people power\". Yet the death of the critic is to be mourned. If we only listen to those who already share our proclivities and interests, the supposed critical democracy will lead to a dangerous attenuation of taste and conservatism of judgment. Without critics of authority, the size and variety of contemporary criticism may ultimately serve the cause of cultural banality and uniformity. \u00b7 R\u00f3n\u00e1n McDonald is the author of The Death of the Critic.
