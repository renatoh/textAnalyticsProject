Yesterday, in the lingering aftermath of England's seven-wicket defeat to South Africa A in Potchefstroom and with the first Test starting here tomorrow, a 45-minute team meeting was followed by a group huddle and a vigorous practice session. It was almost like old times. Almost, but not quite. England are riding so high on the back of 10 Test wins out of 11 that it would require Steve Harmison and Andrew Flintoff to be fed to the performing dolphins along Port Elizabeth's beach front to plunge them into anything even approaching a crisis. Seven-wicket defeat? What seven-wicket defeat? To listen to the coach Duncan Fletcher yesterday was to sense the mood of a team who really believe they can become the first English side to win a Test series in South Africa since Mike Smith's men 40 years ago. \"We're definitely ready for this Test series,\" Fletcher said, bridling at the suggestion that the pre-nets meeting was anything other than routine. \"The defeat is not a big deal for the team at all. We saw it all along as a practice match. The wicket was very difficult to bat on and these are individuals who have come from behind on numerous occasions.\" For the moment, Fletcher is backing his big-name players to find their feet and be all right on the night. Since the top-order batsmen Marcus Trescothick, Mark Butcher and Graham Thorpe managed only 23 runs in six combined innings in the Potchefstroom debacle, and Harmison and his new-ball partner Matthew Hoggard claimed only four wickets, it is tempting to say that he does not have much alternative. But Butcher's recent track record is of turning it on when it matters, and Fletcher regards Thorpe as the master of the big occasion. Most crucially of all, Harmison reported yesterday that he had suddenly rediscovered his rhythm in the nets after taking two for 120 against South Africa A. What would have sounded like bluster a few years ago rings with conviction today. \"We used to struggle to beat the West Indies in the West Indies,\" said Fletcher, \"and we gave them a good hiding. And when they came to England we beat them convincingly. We have the same attitude now: we feel we can go out there and beat South Africa in this Test series.\" The kidology leading up to any series, of course, dictates that South Africa take the opposite view. \"It's going to be quite interesting to see how they [England] bounce back and adapt to the conditions here,\" said the all-rounder Andrew Hall, one of several players in the South African squad to have struggled this week with a bout of food poisoning. \"We know that they haven't had a lot of cricket in the last couple of months and they've only had the one warm-up match. As a team we're looking to strike early and get our tails up. The longer the series goes on and the more they get used to the conditions, the tougher it's going to be for us.\" South Africa have had a miserable time over the past two years, slipping from the top of the world rankings (they momentarily and rather unjustly led Australia in the early part of 2003) to sixth and winning only one of their last 10 Tests away from home turf. But their home form - 10 wins out of 11 since March 2002 - along with a sense of urgency engendered by their new, plain-speaking coach Ray Jennings has given them something to cling on to. \"We know that we're better than sixth place,\" said Hall. \"But only one of our last seven series has been at home and we haven't toured well. It's something the guys have been working at, and in India recently we competed in a lot of aspects even though we lost 1-0. But we know where we want to go. This is a vital series for us.\" For all the talk about the Ashes, it is vital for England, too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
