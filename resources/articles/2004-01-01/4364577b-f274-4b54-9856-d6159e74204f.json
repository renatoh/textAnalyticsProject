Here they can sample their country's wild new dance music, in which traditional samba beats collide with funk, R&amp;B and hip-hop. Favela Chic is also the title of a Parisian restaurant where a collective of DJs, cooks, stylists and drummers organise parties and events to promote this new music. This compilation is a taster for a forthcoming London appearance, and provides a rousing introduction to the new Brazilian scene. There's a bit of everything here, from the brash, jangling Latin funk of Os Diagonais, to the light but gutsy samba of Sandra Sa, or the spluttering funk-rap of Marcelo D2, who sounds like the Brazilian answer to Manu Chao. Then there's cool, rhythmic and slinky balladry from Seu Jorge, son of the great Jorge Ben, and the relaxed, warm vocals of Beth Carvalho. A fine, if wildly varied party album, all it lacks is decent sleeve notes to introduce Brazil's new artists to a wider audience. \u00b7 Favela Chic play the Notting Hill Arts Club in London on January 27."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
