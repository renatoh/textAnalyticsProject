Police said he appeared to have died from a massive 'chop wound' to the head, possibly inflicted with a machete or a hatchet. The attack happened in the small village of Norwich, where Berbick lived. He was found at 6.30am, having last been seen at a party earlier that night. The violence of Berbick's death is unlikely to surprise many followers of his life and career, which have often been marred by violence and strange incidents. His untimely end is likely to cast yet another shadow over boxing, which frequently suffers from an image of violence outside the ring. Nor will it help Jamaica's efforts to stem a tide of violent crime that is hurting the island's image as a popular tourist destination. But Berbick was not a convincing boxing hero for fans, even proud Jamaicans, despite beating Ali and fighting other greats, including Larry Holmes and Mike Tyson. In fact his troubled history and frequent run-ins with the law make Tyson's troubled life look almost normal. Berbick returned to Jamaica in 2003 after being deported from the United States following a series of run-ins with the authorities. It was the second time that he had been ordered to leave the country. His criminal problems began in 1991 when he was convicted of assault after attacking his business manager and putting a gun to her head. In 1992 he was convicted of sexually assaulting a babysitter and sentenced to four years in jail in Florida. That year he was also found guilty of fraudulently obtaining a mortgage. After coming out of prison Berbick was deported from the US and moved to Canada. He eventually moved back to America, but was deported for a second time and returned home to Jamaica. Berbick's private life was as troubled as his public one. Though he was believed to be 52 when he died, his true age is not known for sure. Some records show him to be as old as 56, others as young as 49. Explaining the discrepancies, he once said: 'Legally, I'm a spirit. I have no age.' But, despite his problems, Berbick - who once claimed to have had a vision from God when he was 16 -did excel inside the boxing ring. Though far from a giant of the sport, he beat Ali in 1981 and five years later he the World Boxing Council heavyweight title briefly five years later after winning a bout against Pinklon Thomas. It was Tyson, then just 20 years old, who ended Berbick's reign with a knockout in the second round of a fight in 1986. That made Tyson the youngest heavyweight champion in history and started the decline of Berbick's career. His career total was an impressive 50 wins, 11 defeats and one draw, and he was known for his strong punches. His wins included 33 knockouts and he represented Jamaica at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal. But his career also included some bizarre bouts including a 'boxer vs wrestler' fight in Japan. The fight ended in farce and Berbick walking out during the first round claiming he had been 'double-crossed' into appearing. He also made the classic journeyman boxer's mistake of staying in the sport for far too long. His last professional fight was in 2000 in Florida. He won, but afterwards a scan of his brain showed a blood clot. That caused the boxing authorities to revoke his licence and he never fought again. His last job had been helping to train young boxers. He leaves six children from his two marriages."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
