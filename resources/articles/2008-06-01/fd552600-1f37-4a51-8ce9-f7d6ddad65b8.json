For those who were organised in the spring, it is a cause for celebration as they harvest the fruits of their labour. But others, who didn't quite get around to sowing, feel like losers. I have often found myself in this latter group, but have learned not to brood on another wasted season because all is not lost. There is much you can do now to keep harvesting into winter. Those who managed their spring sowings will call it the second big push of the year. For the rest of us, it's a second chance. Seed can be sown straight into the ground. However, if you have a problem with slugs and snails eating young plants, it may be worth starting off plants in pots and transferring to open ground once they're established. Pay careful attention to watering. When sowing, water the ground first to encourage root growth. If you lack outdoor space, there are plenty of crops to be sown in pots and trays. Here are some of the things I'll be sowing this summer: Oriental greens With such a variety of tastes, shapes and colours, oriental greens can be particularly rewarding for a small garden or for container growing: treated them as a cut-and-come-again crop (send of article), they make a ready-made salad bag with distinctive peppery flavours. Varieties include red mustard, pak choi, mizuna and mibuna, but they are often sold as mixes - see the Organic Gardening Catalogue (0845 130 1304; organiccatalog.com) and Thompson &amp; Morgan (01473 688821; seeds.thompson-morgan.com). Call it control freakery, but I prefer to grow these leaves separately - I like to be the one who decides on the proportions of different leaf in my salad. I grow more mizuna (a less peppery rocket) than red mustard because the latter becomes coarse if left to get too big. Pak choi is a good one to leave to mature, and then eat steamed or in stir-fries. Although some seed packets claim oriental greens can be sown from spring right through summer, it's best to hold off until late July. This avoids eager plants bolting in the hottest months, and allows them to reach maturity in a cooler, autumnal garden. Her greens There are many other leaves that prefer to grow on in cooler temperatures and that will bolt only if it gets too hot. Rocket is one example, and will grow like a weed given half the chance; what's more, it is largely ignored by slugs and snails. Leaf beet refers to perpetual spinach and Swiss chard, both members of the beetroot family but grown for their leaves. Perpetual spinach has a coarser leaf than normal spinach and a stem that can be on the chewy side. But what it lacks in subtlety of taste, it makes up for in ease of cultivation: it's hardier and less prone to bolting. If planted between now and the end of summer, perpetual spinach can be harvested as cut-and-come-again leaves for salad, or left to grow on, where it will give fresh leaves into early winter and will probably even tough it out to next spring. Swiss chard is similarly rugged. 'Rainbow' chard and 'Bright Lights' are pretty, old-fashioned types, but the taste vote goes to the green varieties, such as 'White Silver'. Harvest mature chard and perpetual spinach by twisting off as many leaves as needed from the outside of the plant. With its handsome crinkly leaves, kale, like chard, is an attractive plant; 'Red Russian' can be grown either as baby leaves or left to mature. 'Black Tuscan', known in fashionable eateries as cavolo nero, will probably not make mature plants if sown now, but its distinctive, blue-green leaves will pep up a salad come autumn. Other easy leaves are texsel greens, which taste like spinach with a slight garlic note, and American land cress, the land-lubber equivalent of watercress. And don't forget lettuce. Many varieties are still good to plant now, so scan the seed catalogues for one that takes your fancy. Roots At the beginning of July, the sowing of \"early\", or quick-maturing, varieties of beetroot and carrot will give you a crop in autumn. Beetroot is more appetising harvested as baby roots and should be largely problem-free - popular choices include 'Boltardy' and 'Burpee's Golden'. Carrots, however, are a different story. They are temperamental on heavy clay ground, preferring well-drained, sandy soils. If you have clay, it is better to grow a stubby or rounded variety that has less depth to penetrate - 'Parmex' (from Thompson &amp; Morgan, as before) is a reliable round variety that's also ideal for sowing in a window box or pot. Suitable long-rooted varieties include 'Early Nantes', 'Sytan' and 'Autumn King'. Beans Normally, one would expect to sow french beans in May or June, but you can get away with a July sowing of quick-maturing dwarf varieties: french beans can be ready to crop in as little as eight weeks, so should they bear fruit before summer's end, but are small enough to go under a cloche should frost threaten as winter approaches. Suitable varieties include 'Masterpiece Stringless' and 'Duel' from Marshalls (01480 443390; marshalls-seeds.co.uk). Cut-and-come-again This describes the repeat sowing of immature seedlings for salad, and means that seeds can be planted much closer together than it says on the pack (about 1cm apart). Sow outside in little ditches known as drills with about 10cm between them, or alternatively in a pot or tray that has holes for drainage. Leaves are ready when between 6cm and 10cm high. Always cut leaving the two baby leaves closest to the ground (about 2cm high) and the seedling will regrow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
