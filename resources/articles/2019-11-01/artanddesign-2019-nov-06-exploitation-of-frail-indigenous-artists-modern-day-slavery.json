Sally Scales, a Pitjantjatjara woman from Pipalyatjara, called on supporters and buyers to \u201cstand up and be counted\u201d in addressing the apparent resurgence of shady practices by some individual art dealers. On Tuesday Guardian Australia reported on urgent demands for a full investigation into allegations that at least three artists had been taken from their remote central Australian communities by a private dealer, and at least one was being forced to pay off a $20,000 debt by producing new paintings. The award-winning APY artists\u2019 collective from central Australia alleged \u201cdamaging, dangerous, unscrupulous\u201d practices were occurring in Alice Springs, in a letter to the South Australian premier, Steven Marshall, the federal minister for the arts, Paul Fletcher, and the federal minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt. Wyatt and Marshall have both said they are \u201cconcerned\u201d by the reports and both have committed to investigate the issue further. Scales said there were a \u201cwhole range of carpetbaggers\u201d preying on vulnerable people, and it was \u201cdisheartening and worrisome for elders and for the leadership of the APY arts centres.\u201d Scales said art centres were a safe space for Indigenous elders and disabled people to work, as well as younger generations, but once an artist gained a high profile the \u201ccarpetbaggers move in\u201d, luring them to town. The impact on the community is immediate. \u201cArtists are the providers in their families,\u201d she said. \u201cThe carpetbaggers are literally taking food off the table for kids and elders.\u201d Scales said there needed to be a greater focus on the exploitation of artists than on current concerns around fake Indigenous art. The Indigenous Art Code \u2013 a voluntary code of conduct for the industry \u2013 was not having an impact. \u201cWe\u2019ve got modern-day slavery happening in central Australia we need to deal with,\u201d Scales said. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we change that?\u201d Director of Tjala Arts, Nyunmiti Burton, said she has been talking about this for decades. \u201cWe keep talking to government about why art centres matter,\u201d Burton said. \u201cWe will keep fighting this with every new generation.\u201d Marcus Schutenko, director of the museum and art gallery of the NT (MAGNT), said allegations of artists being made to paint off the debts of their family members was \u201cincredibly serious\u201d and should be a police matter. Schutenko said there was a long history of artists being exploited, and there needed to be stronger guidelines and definitions around ethics. \u201cThere\u2019s a concern about finger pointing and an individual saying they\u2019re ethical but pointing to someone and saying they aren\u2019t ethical,\u201d he said. \u201cWe really do need some strong sense of guidelines when anyone is accused of not being ethical.\u201d Schutenko said the Indigenous Art Code was at arm\u2019s length from the different parties \u2013 artists, gallerists, and art centres \u2013 but was working for them. MAGNT hosts the annual Telstra National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Awards (Natsiaas) , and frequently acquires nationally significant Indigenous artworks. \u201cOur process is that we\u2019ll always try to work directly with an art centre through who an artist is represented by,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to us to be able to follow the provenance.\u201d This included conducting investigations to ensure best practise and ethics were followed throughout the history of a work\u2019s creation and procurement, he said. \u201cThere have been instances where an individual wished to donate an artwork to the museum, and I\u2019ve been aware of at least one instance that we can\u2019t guarantee that best practise was followed and we declined the acquisition.\u201d He said he couldn\u2019t think of an instance where MAGNT had collaborated with the dealer named by the APY letter. Asked what MAGNT could do to address exploitation of artists in the NT, Schutenko said they could be \u201cpart of the conversation in facilitating the discussion of the real definitions and guidelines in this space.\u201d Scales is calling for the industry to support Aboriginal artists in their fight against carpetbaggers. \u201cI want my elders to have some support in this. If you are a supporter, stand up and be counted. \u201cWhen are people going to say, enough is enough?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
