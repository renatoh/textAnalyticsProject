You imagine the belle-\u00e9poque spas, casinos and balls that made the area the playground of the European elite - a legacy continued today by Milanese fashion designers, Roman aristocrats, and Hollywood star George Clooney, who owns a \u00a37m mansion by Lake Como. And you envisage the famously opulent Villa d'Este hotel, where a jacket and tie is de rigueur for dinner and a club sandwich will set you back \u00a317. A trip to the region need not, however, be prohibitively expensive - if you're prepared to travel off-season, fly budget airline, and stay in smaller, family-run hotels that aren't always right by the water. It is also possible to enjoy the fascinating variety of mood imparted by each of the five major lakes - Maggiore, Lugano, Como, Iseo and Garda - in a driving holiday of 10 days or so. From Maggiore in the west to Garda in the east is a distance of just 160km and, while circuitous lakeside roads and dizzying mountain passes can make the journey at least twice that distance, it's easy to find strategic bases from which none of the unmissable attractions are very far. We started at Maggiore, a small section of which stretches north into Switzerland. While the area can appear quite industrialised and built-up - this is decidedly not the bucolic Lake District or Lakes of Killarney - there are views from the road that sweeps along the western shores of Maggiore that beguile and transport you like few others. In late spring and autumn the temperature sits comfortably above 70F - the gentle, pale blue water so still, and the thin, opaque mist that lays upon it so delicate, it looks like a meditative Japanese watercolour. It's at times like this that you can see why the Italian Lakes appealed so ardently to English romantic poets and Italian opera composers. There is something theatrical yet elegiac about the scenery. There is none of the bluster and brashness of the seaside, none of that dazzling sunlight. To Italians, this can be a distinct disadvantage. Some regard the lakes as too triste (sad) to holiday in. On Maggiore, we stayed at a great value hotel that may have been a little away from the more popular resorts of Stresa and Verbania, but that was quiet, unhurried - and lakeside. The 55-room, four-star Hotel Cannero, located on the northern tip of the lake, was built in the mid-1800s as a monastery, and has been owned and run by the Gallinotto family since 1902. From here we visited lavish, grandiose Isola Bella, just offshore from Stresa. On the island is a vast baroque palazzo, overflowing with art treasures, and an extravagantly terraced garden with artificial grottoes and ornate fountains, obelisks and statues. Our next base was Lake Lugano. Perhaps it's because most of the lake lies in Switzerland, or because its surrounding landscape is wilder and less inhabited, but Lugano was supremely restful and relaxing. Here the charm is that there is little activity on the lake. We checked into the Stella d'Italia in San Mamete on the northern, Italian shore, and kicked back for a few days, taking leisurely breakfasts on the arboured terrace by the water's edge, swimming in the cool and invigorating lake, and sampling superb dishes such as ossobucco . From San Mamete it is a quick 20km journey to busier Lake Como, where we took in two of the area's most celebrated sites - the elegant Villa Carlotta mansion and gardens, and the lovely town of Bellagio, best approached by water. The early-18th century Villa Carlotta in Tremezzo has a neoclassical symmetry and perfection to it, and a large garden with lemon and orange trees, climbing roses, azalea and specimen rhododendron. From the pontoon opposite the villa, you board a ferry that takes you across Como to beautiful Bellagio. Perched at the tip of a promontory that divides the lake in two, Bellagio's natural position and long watery aspects is enough to draw admirers. Add its pastel-shaded historic hotels, a maze of steep cobbled alleys, fine shops and lakefront cafes and bars, and you have one of the lakes' most enchanting attractions. We also took the scenic road south along the Como shoreline to Cernobbio, driving nonchalantly by the \u00a3420-a-night Villa d'Este, and nipping across the Swiss border to the Foxtown shopping village in Mondrisio. It is a dispiriting, American-style mall, on four levels, but it has 130 shops offering designer labels such as Prada, Gucci, Guess and La Perla at heavily discounted prices. On the way to Lake Iseo, we stopped off at Bergamo, which, despite being looked down upon by its haughty near neighbour Milan, is not to be missed. On a hill to the north of the city stands one of the finest walled medieval towns in Italy. There's a stunning old square, Piazza Vecchia, and narrow cobbled streets that lead to funky modern clothes shops and historic cafes. Smaller Lake Iseo, just west of Bergamo, is much more low-key than Como. The architecture in the 12th-century town of Iseo seems less elaborate than elsewhere on the lakes and the lakefront is more open, the mountain views more spacious. We stayed at a four-star hotel high up the wooded hills, I Due Roccoli. The views from the 19 guest rooms out over the lake were reason enough for the detour, as was the simple yet beautifully executed food in the restaurant. The wine list featured a fine selection from the nearby Franciacorta region. Garda, the largest of the lakes, is perhaps the area's number one attraction, with the picturesque medieval spa town of Sirmione often crowded to capacity in the summer. The mood was not just more touristy, but more Germanic, too. There were none of the gossamer northern mists here; the sharper southern light made everything almost hyper-real. The shorelines seemed closer than they actually were, the buildings and the landscape felt lit from within, and the lakeside promenades had the breezy feel of the seaside. We stayed near Gardone Riviera at the Locanda agli Angeli, opposite the preposterous but compelling Vittoriale degli Italiani. The one-time residence of 20th-century Italian poet, poseur, womaniser and egomaniac Gabriele D'Annunzio, the Vittoriale is worth a visit just to see the coffin in which D'Annunzio meditated and the prow of a battleship lodged in the gardens to commemorate his attempt to \"liberate\" the city of Fiume from Yugoslav rule. The locanda has 16 stylish rooms divided between two buildings - the original trattoria and a large 17th-century house restored with a tasteful eye. The owners Patrizia and Elisabetta Pellegrini have imported smart colonial-style furniture from Indonesia; guest rooms have canopied four-poster beds and rustic marble bathrooms. It's a small, two-star operation yet the delicious home-made food (grilled perch from the lake, rabbit cooked in a local red wine) was about the best, and best value, we tasted. It was our last great \"affordable lakes\" moment, but perhaps not the finest. That belonged to the pretty medieval village of Orta San Giulio by lesser-known Lake Orta, near Maggiore. Arriving late in the afternoon at the graceful main square, Piazza Motta, we found a table right by the water and ordered a prosecco and a Campari. Behind us was an elegant row of weathered and sun-bleached houses. By the pier, a dapper boat captain in a crisp white polo shirt and peaked cap chatted amiably with two elderly women. Past old wooden rowing boats named Sofia and Filomenia, was the glorious deep turquoise lake sparkling in a sun that slowly set behind the hazy, blue-white mountains beyond. It seems almost vulgar to mention it, but at just \u20ac3 each, the aperitifs were a bargain. The view, of course, was just about priceless.
