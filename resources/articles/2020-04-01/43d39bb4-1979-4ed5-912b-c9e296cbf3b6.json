Some of the rules are unclear and the different penalties for each state and territory makes some of the new infringements confusing. While police commissioners have said they will use discretion in issuing fines, there are reports of people being stopped by police for undertaking activities \u2013 such as buying takeaway coffee \u2013 that appear to be allowed. We\u2019d like to hear from people about their experiences dealing with police on the new social distancing measures in all states and territories. Share your experiences Have you been stopped by officers or had any interaction with police while going about your day since the new rules were introduced?
