In the event the concluding stages proved something of a travesty: this maritime marathon was plagued with light winds and calm patches and a topsy-turvy switch of positions overnight. The final leg was won by Knut Frostad's Djuice, more commonly found at the other end of the eight-boat fleet. Erle Williams, who took leave from Team New Zealand's America's Cup campaign to co-skipper the boat, ditched three of the 12 regular crew and almost half the sail wardrobe to combat Djuice's inherent slowness. Shedding almost a tonne was the only way to compete. Illbruck finished 35 minutes behind Djuice, but the spirits of the crowd that had gathered to cheer home the first German-flagged winner of this race were not dampened. More than 500 boats of varying sizes accompanied the green-and-white-hulled overall victor, while a further 350 were moored on the west side of the channel leading to the short finishing line. The next three boats were still 20 miles off that line when Illbruck crossed it, but a close contest was developing between Neal McDonald's Assa Abloy, guaranteed second place overall wherever it finished, Grant Dalton's Amer Sports One, with a third place overall, and Lisa McDonald's Amer Sports Too. Trailing them by another five miles were Gunnar Krantz's SEB, Jez Fanstone's News Corp and Kevin Shoebridge's Tyco, the three boats which had led at the halfway stage before hitting a calm patch to the east of Anholt Island."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
