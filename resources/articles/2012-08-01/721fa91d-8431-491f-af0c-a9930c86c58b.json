One century and one half century in 23 championship innings in 2011 meant the 36-year-old's place in the Yorkshire team was far from secure and the prospects of his contract being renewed at the end of 2012 were minimal. They are rather better than that now. A century, the Bradfordian's second of the season, ensured Yorkshire picked up five batting bonus points and put them in a dominant position against the league leaders. Whether they can go on to enforce a win may depend in part on the weather \u2013 Friday's forecast is dire \u2013 but their cause has been strengthened by England's releasing of Tim Bresnan. Having made his way up from London, the all-rounder struck with the last ball of the day to remove the Derbyshire captain Wayne Madsen leg-before. \"It was a pretty good day for us \u2013 we'd hoped for two or three wickets, but we'll take one, especially off the last ball,\" said McGrath. \"Speaking personally I'm still enjoying my cricket and I want to carry on as long as I can, so it's nice to score a few runs. It's not been easy because I've been batting in different positions all season, so that felt good.\" The morning session had seen Adam Lyth and Gary Ballance pick up where they had left off the previous day, playing with a pleasing freedom in bringing up a 100 partnership off 147 balls. Lyth seemed certain to go on to three figures, but to his obvious disgust contrived to steer a wide half-volley from Ross Whiteley gently into the hands of point when on 93. Ballance was less culpable in missing out on a century, edging a catch behind off a Tim Groenwald delivery that left him off the pitch. But McGrath, never one to be rushed, was already accumulating quietly. There was the odd startling moment of aggression, such as lifting Wes Durston for a straight six to go to 35, but otherwise it was a case picking up his ones and twos, and it took him 121 balls to get to 50. Adil Rashid came and went quickly but McGrath found a more adhesive partner in Andrew Hodd, the Sussex wicketkeeper, who has moved to Yorkshire on a short-term deal to cover for the absence of Jonny Bairstow. Having previously had talks with Yorkshire about a permanent move, Hodd must have been anxious to impress, and did so. He too declined to be hurried, so much so that by the time he and McGrath finally began to accelerate there was some danger the fifth batting point would slip away. As it was McGrath timed it perfectly, a sweet on-drive to the boundary off Groenwald bringing up both his century and, with three balls to spare, the Yorkshire 400. With a poor forecast for Friday, it seemed an obvious moment for the Yorkshire captain Andrew Gale to declare and have as many overs at Derbyshire as possible. Instead he chose to bat on and saw his side lose their last five wickets for nine runs in just 15 balls. The primary beneficiary of an appalling series of slogs \u2013 with Bresnan playing the worst \u2013 was Wes Durston, the former Unicorn picking up his first five-wicket haul in first-class cricket."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
