The court's 3-2 vote cleared the way for Pinochet to be tried on the latest charges of human rights abuses during his 1973-90 regime. \"The sentence ... has been confirmed,\" the court secretary, Carlos Meneses, said, referring to Pinochet's appeal. Gen Pinochet remained at his countryside residence west of Santiago, where he will remain under house arrest during the trial. He has been there recovering from a stroke he suffered in December. The ruling prompted applause and cheers from relatives of victims of Gen Pinochet's regime. \"We are happy, the entire world is happy,\" said Lorena Pizarro, president of an association of relatives of dissidents who were killed. \"Pinochet cannot continue to live in impunity.\" Gen Pinochet's chief lawyer, Pablo Rodriguez, said the house arrest of the former ruler \"will be carried out as ordered by the court, but we will ask authorisation to transfer General Pinochet to a hospital in case of a new stroke\". He insisted that \"this ruling does not respect General Pinochet's basic right to a just process.\" Presidential spokesman Francisco Vidal said: \"This shows that we have developed a solid, stable democracy than can absorb this ruling with calm and tranquillity.\" Tuesday's ruling upheld the indictment and house arrest ordered on December 13 by Judge Juan Guzman, which had been questioned by Gen Pinochet's defence lawyers, who claim he is not well enough to stand trial. In 2002 the supreme court struck down an indictment filed by Mr Guzman against Gen Pinochet in another human rights case, after doctors diagnosed the former dictator with a moderate case of dementia. Judges have clearly changed their mind regarding Gen Pinochet's health. Guzman has said he was influenced by an interview Gen Pinochet gave to a Spanish-language TV station in Miami last year in which he appeared lucid."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
