If Arsenal have a weakness it's still that they lose their rag pretty easily, and there are no more obstructive, aggressive and downright violent a bunch of thugs in Division One than United. Matt Rowson Watford www.bsad.org \u00b7 They can't. I suppose their best hope is to get the ball out wide for Ndlovu and Tonge and get some decent crosses in. With Arsenal's defence destabilised by injury, there's always the chance of an error. Warnock sides are very sly, though, so I wouldn't be surprised to see the United players leave in a foot or two as the early exchanges transpire, to try to rile Arsenal into getting Vieira sent off. Ben Wilson Palace www.cpfc.org \u00b7 They should just go for it - without being reckless, of course. If they sit back and Arsenal score, it'll be a goalfest. Oh, and they'll need an enormous amount of luck and some dodgy decisions. We wish them well. Pauline Pratley Burnley surf.to/londonclarets \u00b7 Black Magic? Plague of locusts? The Blades look to be suffering from too many games and frankly I think a defeat would be a blessing. A cup final could mean no chance of promotion. Martin Brailli Reading www.star-reading.org \u00b7 Close them down and don't let them play - easy. They have got to match their work rate. Arsenal are a great side because they work incredibly hard both in possession and out of it. Sheffield United must follow their runners. Jonny Barton Coventry www.letsallsingtogether.com \u00b7 One of two ways: a) use their wide players to get behind an Arsenal defence not renowned for pace, or b) chase and press Arsenal every time the Gooners have the ball, not giving them time to play their normal game. Then there's always c) - employ the services of a sniper to take out Thierry Henry before kick-off. Chas Rayner Gillingham Gillsconnect.com \u00b7 Maybe the question should be how could Arsenal lose to the Blades? Sheffield United's defence isn't blessed with the physical (or mental) attributes to keep out Arsenal's strikers, so it will be up to the midfield, where United run around a lot, closing down, tapping ankles and generally being pests. It will be won and lost in midfield, and that depends on the attitude of Vieira and Silva. By the way, Kabba kills. Tony Butcher Grimsby www.electronicfishcake.com \u00b7 Sheffield United could employ their usual tactic and try to get a few Arsenal players sent off early on. Carefully does it, though. They are very good at it and risk getting the match abandoned if too many leave the field - something else they are familiar with. Either that or a miracle. I'd like United to win, though. Julian Watkins Ipswich TractorBoys.com \u00b7 United will have to be at their best and Arsenal at their worst - but then that goes for most of the rest of the Premiership, too, when they play the Gunners. United's exploits this season have given the lie to the supposed gulf between Div One and the Premiership. If there's a gap between the top eight and the bottom eight, it is more to do with the strength in depth of Premiership squads, not the qualities of the best XIs. Colin Farmery Portsmouth pompey-fans.com \u00b7 United have been a credit to the Nationwide. Going forward, Tonge is a fantastic player, and so is Kabba. If Paddy Kenny can keep the score down at the other end then they'll have a chance. The Blades always seem to score against quality opposition. Rob Cooper Reading www.Reading-MAD.co.uk \u00b7 Tie Henry's bootlaces together. But United aren't a bad side when they try to play football rather than get physical. They have an excellent midfield and, as shown against other Premiership teams this season, they'll give them a run for their money. Arsenal will still need to have a real off day, though. Chris Miller Walsall www.SaddlersNet.com \u00b7 They have to avoid sitting back and praying for a 1-0 win. If they do that Arsenal will pin them back and pound them. United also need to target Arsenal's central, which has been weakened by injury. Tom Sperrink Wolves www.thewolves.info Divine intervention? We don't need it... Most neutrals, Gooners and even some Blades probably think the only way United can beat Arsenal is with divine intervention, but that wouldn't be fair to a side who are in their second cup semi-final of the season and challenging for a return to the Premiership. Neil Warnock (pictured right), with a fine mix of youth and experience, has fashioned a side that combines industry, commitment and no little skill. This season we have seen some of the best Bramall Lane football in years. Warnock's players have beaten Leeds (twice), Sunderland and Liverpool, showing that, contrary to the manager's reputation, we aren't a team of cloggers and long-ball merchants. United have the luxury of knowing they're in a no-lose situation, and Warnock says: 'We'll play our normal game. There's no point going defensive because we'll get beat easy if we do that so we might as well have a go at them. If we sit back and get beat it's going to be a crap day.' Quite. In a league encounter, United would probably play 4-5-1 in an attempt to stifle Arsenal but at Old Trafford they'll switch between 4-4-2 and 4-3-3 as play dictates. And rather than worrying about Arsenal's strikers they'll seek to hold the likes of Vieira and Ljunberg in midfield and rely on the creativity of Brown, Tonge and Ndlovu to test Arsenal's weakness - their defence. Steve Kabba's pace will worry Campbell and whoever partners him, Wayne Allison will deliver the aerial threat, and any loose ball around the edge of the box will provide Michael Brown with the perfect opportunity to add another spectacular strike to the dozen or so screamers he has scored this season. And if, despite all that, we still need divine intervention, inspiration will surely come from the midfielder of whom the faithful sing 'Michael Brown, my Lord'...
