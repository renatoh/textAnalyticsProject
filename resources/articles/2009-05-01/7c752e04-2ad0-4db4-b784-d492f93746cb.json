Broad was one of the match officials who was left stranded on a Lahore roundabout in a minivan after an attack on the Sri Lanka team coach killed six police and security officials and injured seven Sri Lanka players. More than two months later, as he recalled yesterday, normality is returning. The Pakistani umpire, Ahzan Raza, who had lain bleeding next to him with a serious stomach wound, has started umpiring again, Broad has made his own gentle return to match referee duties by standing in a couple of World Cup qualifying tournament ties in Johannesburg. There is also the exciting prospect of watching his son, Stuart, take on Australia in this summer's Ashes series. It is something, he nodded in agreement, that it is worth staying alive for. But a visit to watch State Of Play, a crime thriller starring Helen Mirren and Russell Crowe, was a reminder that all is not entirely well. \"The flashbacks had been getting fewer and fewer. But we were sat right at the front of the auditorium and the film starts with a bullet being fired at one of the characters. Instantly I realised it was exactly the same sound that I heard when I was lying in the van at Liberty Roundabout in Lahore. \"It is a very difficult sound to describe but it was a real thudding sound of a bullet hitting body. As soon as I heard it, I flinched. It was unbelievably real to me. That is the first film I have seen since with gunfire and true-to-life events. Whether it brought it all back or whether the sound was just too loud, I don't know, but it caused a shudder.\" Broad accepted the ICC's offer of counselling after the terrorist attack but believes that, like most of those involved, \"we have now gone past that stage and we are dealing with it ourselves\". He is privately unimpressed by the Pakistan Cricket Board's threats of legal action because they have been withdrawn as co-hosts for the 2011 World Cup, but his anger has died down and he settles for saying that their action \"is not ideal \u2013 it would be nice if everyone concentrated on making the event a success\". The Broads, father and son, were together in Nottingham yesterday to open the fourth of five npower urban cricket centres in socially deprived areas, part of cricket's determination to rid itself of the reputation as an exclusively middle-class game. Stuart needs one more impressive Test, against the West Indies at Chester-le-Street beginning on Thursday, to take the new ball in the opening Ashes Test in Cardiff in July. For his father, who scored hundreds in three successive Ashes Tests in Australia when England retained the Ashes in 1986-87, it would be a marvellous end to a traumatic year. Chris Broad talks about his son with a hint of trepidation. Too many opinions will invariably ruffle the feathers of an equally independent character. On Stuart's rejection of the IPL, however, to commit full energy to England's summer, family pride cannot be disguised. \"IPL was certainly talked about but it was Stuart's decision, a very mature decision,\" he said. \"He is being asked to do an awful lot in the team for a very young player. Part of being an international cricketer is knowing when to take your rest. The money on offer at the IPL is enormous and something that you have to consider but he is looking at the bigger picture. He is a very sensible young man who thinks long and hard about where he is going. \"He has an unbelievable future ahead of him providing he stays fit and his form continues. He is the type of kid who just loves the game and has the ability to it. If he stays healthy, I certainly won't have to give him too much of my pension when he retires.\" Broad Jnr batted loosely in the first Test at Lord's last week and has vowed to adopt a more sober approach at Chester\u2011le-Street. Chris may regret this harmless revelation of a family conversation: \"Funnily enough, he said to me this morning 'I don't have the patience yet to build an innings because the time I come to the crease I'm normally batting with the tail and I feel I have to get on with it and get runs. \"But you have better batsmen down the order in Test cricket these days so you can afford to build an innings. To be dropped four times, he was chasing a lot of wide deliveries. It is like any youngster coming into the game \u2013 it is about choosing the right balls to hit and to leave alone. \"He has concentrated mostly on his bowling to this point, but absolutely he can do both. He has learned so much in such a short space of time.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
