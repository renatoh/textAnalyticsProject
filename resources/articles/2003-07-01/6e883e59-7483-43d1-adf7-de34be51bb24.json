Half a billion pounds in unclaimed Child Tax Credits will revert to the Treasury, because of the families who are likely to miss tomorrow's midnight deadline. But MPs and campaigners are rounding on the Inland Revenue and Treasury because of the complexity of the credits and a series of computer glitches at the call centres handling claimants. In addition to the non-claimants, about 220,000 application forms are still being processed by Revenue officials, three months after payments should have started. 'The Treasury is sitting on over half a billion pounds which belongs to one million families. To have one-sixth of these eligible families left out in the cold is unacceptable,' says Steve Webb, Liberal Democrat spokesman for Work and Pensions. 'The deadline has to be extended, and the application procedure has got to be simplified.' Amid mounting pressure on the Revenue for the unrelated decision to sell its building to a company based in an offshore tax haven, the Treasury last week launched a probe into its tax collection agencies. The review, headed by Treasury Permanent Secretary Gus O'Donnell, could see the Revenue merged with sister organisation Customs &amp; Excise. But the move was attacked as a 'classic diversionary tactic' by Opposition MPs who believe that the Treasury is trying to avoid responsibility for a dogmatic approach to complicated means-tested credits and private finance projects. Chas Roy-Chowdhury, head of taxation at the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, said that the Inland Revenue had not made it clear that there was a dead line to claim payments, even for people who were looking for it. The credit is available to all families with children, and with incomes up to \u00a358,000 a year, or \u00a366,000 a year if there is a child under one year old. It is worth up to \u00a3545 a year and double that in families with a child under one. The Tories will also put pressure on tomorrow over delays in payments of the credit. They will claim that the Government is planning to pay backdated credits in instalments rather than lump sums, although this has been denied by the Revenue. Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary David Willetts will call on the Government to allow tax credit applicants who are waiting for money to apply for emergency interest-free loans from the Social Fund. These would be repayable only once their tax credit claim had been properly resolved. 'Gordon Brown says that tax credits are designed to help people on low incomes,' Willetts said. 'But millions of families have found it impossible to claim the correct money from the Inland Revenue.' The Revenue is advising late claimants to fill out a form on the internet before midnight tomorrow to avoid losing this year's entitlement. Union will tell tax chief: It's time to quit The chairman of the Inland Revenue, Sir Nicholas Montagu, will face a call this week for his resignation, writes Nick Mathiason. The PCS union, which represents the civil servants who work for Montagu, is expected to pass overwhelmingly a conference motion demanding that he goes. The union, which is meeting in Blackpool, is furious at the bungled introduction of tax credits, which has provoked threats and violence against its members. It is also angry that Montagu allowed the sale of 600 Revenue properties to Mapeley, a company based in a tax haven. The motion, backed by the PCS national executive, rails against the 'mismanagement of the Inland Revenue and the impact this has had not only upon PCS members but the community at large'. Montagu is set to retire next year but there have already been persistent calls to him to go early. He claims the support of Chancellor Gordon Brown, but opposition MPs say the Treasury is using him as a scapegoat to hide its own role in the tax credits fiasco and the property sale. Montagu told MPs at a Commons Treasury sub-committee hearing last month that he had offered Brown his resignation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
