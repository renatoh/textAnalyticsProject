For the Senefs, the nickname for the Senegalese of France, one historic triumph has more than demonstrated the strides they have made since their skills have been polished on the professional fields of Lens and Lorient, Monaco and Montpellier, Sedan and Sochaux. Aim\u00e9 Jacquet, France's technical director since leading his nation to the World Cup nirvana four years ago, was not the only one to note that Senegal, in defeating the country where all but the two reserve goalkeepers earn their living, were not just proving a point. Many were also saying au revoir . 'We've outgrown you now.' While the thrill of their fairytale was still fresh, midfielder Khalilou Fadiga encapsulated the essence of Senegal as 'small team, big people'. All that, though, is about to change, with big teams thumbing their chequebooks. An exodus from the French league is inevitable. Even before the tournament began the Lions of Tarenga saw this World Cup as a passport towards the land of the super club. Twelve of the French squad they humiliated experienced Champions League football last season, the arena in which they now feel they belong. The majority favour a switch to England. Liverpool have already made inroads in fixing up deals with the wonderboy El Hadji Diouf and midfield powerhouse Salif Diao. Intriguingly, with news that the Premier League have abolished the restriction on non-EU players to three per club, G\u00e9rard Houllier could buy up the entire Senegal team if he wanted to. If England's work permit rules were also relaxed Liverpool, or any other Premiership club, would be able to buy Africans younger and cheaper. But until that changes, countries such as France will remain the stepping stone. And what an invaluable route to progress that has been. Talents such as Diouf, who grew up playing on dusty streets because his parents didn't have the money to send him to a football school, fancied a life of mischief until he was spotted by Lens at the age of 14. The 21-year-old Diouf, incidentally, was man of the match against France and still believes he can be top scorer here. If he masters the offside trap, that is. French coaching methods are probably the most sophisticated in the world and Senegal's players couldn't have chosen a more poignant game to demonstrate how that has helped them to develop from playful cubs to such a powerful force. The inextricable link between French and Senegalese football was crystallised by the image of Djibril Ciss\u00e9 and Fadiga, team-mates at Auxerre, with their arms clamped around each other after the game. Afterwards, Diao explained how the Senegalese always used to look up to the team he described as a big brother: 'We look up to this team. We watch them play and try to copy them. But now we have shown them what we learned. It is like the children have beaten their parents.' What an extraordinary achievement for the coach who masterminded it all, the Frenchman Bruno Metsu. Bringing European experience and an open mind to immerse himself in Senegalese culture, he instantly earned their respect. The perfect man for the job. Diouf summed up his country's gratitude: 'Bruno Metsu has done a lot for Senegal. He has all the qualities in the world, I find him to be a very good coach and a pleasure to be with as a person. He understands Africa, and is at home in Senegal just as he is in France. He's the man we need at the moment.' Fadiga identified the key Metsu brought to release their potential. 'We have a lot of technical skills but before, like most African teams, we used to play with enthusiasm. Now we are stronger tactically.' So much so that Senegal out-Franced the French. Their game plan was so reminiscent of the model the world champions excelled with in 1998. Based on a solid defensive block, upon which moments of attacking inspiration did the damage, Senegal hardly looked like the World Cup novices they are. Rightly, this shock bore comparison with Cameroon's opening-day victory over Argentina in 1990. But while Cameroon became more and more wild as the game wore on, Senegal never lost their cool - rowdy celebration dance excepted. France's will had ebbed away long before the end anyway. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, in Seoul's marvellous stadium to commentate for Japanese television, was surprised by that. 'It is quite unlike France,' he remarked. 'Until the 60th minute you felt we would score, but after that we lost our composure, became more nervous, and passed with less belief. Maybe it's a warning for France. It will be interesting to see how they react in the next game.' The France coach Roger Lemerre, clutching a video tape as he left the ground, looked shellshocked. Will he learn from it? Not necessarily. He is frustratingly conservative. Frank Leboeuf, such a shambolic figure at the back, will probably retain his place for the next game against Uruguay. Marcel Desailly reckons they need to watch out for South American dirty tricks, but that's hardly necessary to outwit Leboeuf. Lemerre, though, is reluctant to do the obvious defensive repairs by shifting Lilian Thuram into his club position of centre-back and introducing Vincent Candela or Willy Sagnol, two competent right-backs. At least Lemerre has admitted that Youri Djorkaeff was an inadequate replacement for Zinedine Zidane. But who isn't? He is, Diao reflected, 50 per cent of their team, and until the maestro returns to fitness, France may well remain offensively subdued. They are emasculated without him, and the bad news is Lemerre says he would be 'astonished' if Zidane were fit to play. Unfortunately, the sight of him juggling the ball at half-time during the Senegal game was a mirage. It was only an advert on the big screens. 'Of course we missed Zidane,' Bixente Lizarazu admitted, 'but we missed other things too.' Pace, fitness and imagination sprang instantly to mind. Fatigue was clearly a problem for the French and Emmanuel Petit confessed it was a struggle to cope with 85 per cent humidity. 'Maybe the African players handled it better than us,' he said. They had better shape up fast because, as he so succinctly put it, they have no joker left. Within minutes of the final whistle, French players set themselves a target they dare not miss of six points against Uruguay and Denmark. The pressure to do so is clamping down to such an extent the captain Desailly mused that they are no longer even thinking about being world champions, but simply getting out of their group. Naturally, Senegal have similar hopes. Metsu hopes he has instilled enough belief to ensure they prove more than one-shock wonders: 'We are here to learn, and must not get big heads. It is imperative we beat Denmark. We mustn't let up now - what would be the point of beating France in the opening game and then losing to the other two teams and going home? The President did contemplate bringing them home after the opening game to join in the national party, until he realised it was probably sensible for them to honour the name of Senegal for a while longer out in Asia.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
