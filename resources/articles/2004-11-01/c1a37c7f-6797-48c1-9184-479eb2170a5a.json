Austria were the surprise co-leaders with England one behind, two ahead of Japan. Scotland (Alastair Forsyth and Scott Drummond) and Wales (Phillip Price and Bradley Dredge) are at eight and six under respectively. Only one of the 24 teams - Mexico at two over - was over par, although quite how Eduardo Romero and Angel Cabrera of Argentina were second last at two under par is difficult to fathom. Harrington had five birdies, as did McGinley, but McGinley also eagled the long 13th, holing a bunker shot of some 25 feet. Harrington is the eighth ranked player in the world but he said yesterday that he wished he could play with the same adventure all the time as he does when playing with a partner. \"It has a liberating effect,\" he said. \"You tend to play better. I'd like to play my normal golf the way I was playing today.\" Paul Casey, with six birdies, was marginally the stronger man in the England partnership but it was Luke Donald who got the team off to the best of starts by birdying the first two holes. For much of that time Casey was still struggling to get his mind off his recent comments about America and Americans. He had said, in the course of a long interview, that he hated Americans and late yesterday, when the story was picked up in the States, he started getting \"a huge negative feedback\". \"The feedback has been pretty nasty and it has weighed on my mind. I struggled to sleep on Wednesday and the whole thing has upset me and made me angry. Obviously it has made a lot of other people very, very angry, which I understand - but there is one line in that interview that has been run with and yet nobody understands how it was used.\" In the story, first used in the Sunday Times and picked up by the Daily Mirror, the Englishman is quoted as saying: \"I hate Americans.\" \"I don't,\" said Casey yesterday. \"I wouldn't live there if I did. I pay my taxes there, I have an American girlfriend, an American coach, friends. So I wish I could take it back.\" Casey does not dispute he said the word \"hate\" but explained yesterday that it was used in the context of competition; that when he was trying to beat an American, or anyone else in the Ryder Cup or Seve Trophy, for that brief period he \"hated\" his opponent."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
