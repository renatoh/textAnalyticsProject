UK airport operator BAA reported that the number of passengers travelling through major airports declined in November but showed a slight improvement over October's figures. The company said 8.1m passengers passed through its seven UK airports in November, down 10.6% on the same month a year ago. This is a small improvement on October's figures, when BAA's airports saw a fall of 12% over October 2000. Heathrow and Gatwick continued to be the worst affected by the impact of the September 11 terrorist attacks. The number of passengers passing through Heathrow airport was down 13.5% at 4.3m, while Gatwick saw a fall of 19.8% to 1.6m. North Atlantic traffic was down by 26.1%, while all other long haul traffic saw a fall of 12.7%. However BAA said the North Atlantic routes were \"showing signs of improvement,\" as the fall in October had been 31.3%. BAA said Stansted, Edinburgh and Glasgow were again the best performers in November, fuelled by the success of budget airlines. Passengers volumes at Stansted were up 7.2%, with growth of 8.2% in Edinburgh and 3.3% at Glasgow. Meanwhile, the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) reported that nearly 1m people are expected to fly away for a Christmas break, about the same number as last year. An Abta spokeswoman said: \"These statistics will boost travel confidence. People are going on their travels. They don't want to put their lives on hold any longer.\" \"We are not going to do quite as well as last year, but Christmas is looking healthy,\" she added. Despite the September 11 terror attacks, British Airways announced that 30,000 people were flying to New York for the holidays, making it BA's top long-haul destination over Christmas. Abta reported that packages to the Canary Islands were nearly sold out and that mainland Spain was the second-most popular destination. The ski programme was going well with France and Austria the most popular countries for winter sports enthusiasts. The most-booked long-haul destinations were Florida and the Caribbean. A spokeswoman for holiday giant Airtours said: \"Tenerife, Gran Canaria and Lanzarote are our top sellers this Christmas and there had also been demand for Florida with its Disney and Universal Studios attractions. Things are looking extremely promising.\" However, tour operator Thomson Holidays said the number of bookings for summer 2002 package holidays has halved since September 11 compared with the autumn period last year. Next summer's numbers are expected to be about 10% down on the summer 2001 market."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
