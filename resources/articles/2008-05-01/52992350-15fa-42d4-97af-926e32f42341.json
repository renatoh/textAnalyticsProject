Born in Bruges, he dropped out of school at 15 and, unhappy at home, left soon after for the second world war, working in a sugar factory for a while. He soon began writing poetry, joining the group of mostly Dutch poets often referred to as \"the Fiftiers\". As a visual artist - Claus was the son of a painter - he was also involved with the international art movement Cobra (which took its name from the first letters of the major cities of its proponents COpenhagen-BRussels-Amsterdam). In English, his Selected Poems 1953-1973 was published in Scotland in 1986 and a more recent collection, Greetings, in 2005. A large selection of his poetry also appeared in the volume Living Space: Poems of the Dutch Fiftiers in 2005. It is as a novelist, however, that Claus is best known to the English-speaking audience. His first novel, The Duck Hunt - a work inspired by William Faulkner's As I Lay Dying - was published in the US in 1955, and other works, The Swordfish (1996) and Desire (1997) followed. He is perhaps best known, however, for his 1983 masterwork, The Sorrow of Belgium, published by Penguin in 1991 and recently reprinted by the Overlook Press. In the tradition of G\u00fcnter Grass's The Tin Drum, the novel recounts the story of Louis Steynaeve from his time in a Catholic boarding school through the second world war. Claus's clearly autobiographical narrative explores the natures of the Dutch and French-speaking Belgians, and their various collaborations. His intricate insights into the interrelationships of social and governmental corruptions, black-market profiteering, revenge, antisemitism and simple stupidity reveal the reasons for complacency and outright acceptance of the Nazis by thousands of his countrymen, including his own early romanticising of the Germans. As he later admitted: \"The Germans were disciplined, sang marching songs - they were very exotic enemies. Like Louis, I liked them very much.\" In all his works, Claus tackles difficult subjects, including incest, homosexuality, and what he determined were the detrimental effects of religion. Desire depicts a world of small-time drunkards and gamblers, in particular Michel and Jake, who travel together to Las Vegas in search of excitement; what the two discover in the American desert are the entangled tragedies they have left behind; Michel, we gradually perceive, has abandoned the woman he was to marry, Jake's daughter Didi, for a homosexual affair with another of the bar denizens, leaving her in mental collapse. Jake, a seemingly jovial and peaceful man, suddenly lashes out in anger, killing a young gay dancer. Claus's novel The Swordfish recounts the story of a wealthy woman and her son left by her husband in a small, provincial town. Martin, an intense child, who has been converted to religion by a local teacher, sees himself as Jesus bearing the cross to Golgotha, while their drunken hired hand, Richard - a former veterinarian who has been imprisoned for performing unlawful abortions - looks on. Accusations of child abuse and the sexual coupling of the woman, Sibyelle, with a nebbish-like schoolteacher, ends in the brutal murder of Richard's wife. In his 1969 play Friday, Claus explores an incestuous relationship. When George Vermeersch returns from prison, he discovers his wife is having an affair with another man. Partially in revenge, but also in an attempt at reconciliation, he admits that he has had a sexual relationship with their daughter; the wife, in turn, admits that she had known of the situation without demanding it come to an end, and, as the lover leaves her, the two are left to reconstruct their empty marriage. For all his seemingly dark and despairing portrayals of Flemish life, however, Claus was a great believer in the human race, recognising everyone as interconnected and linked; accordingly, any evil or mean act of his figures affects the entire society. The betrayal of anyone is the betrayal of all. As Claus noted in a magazine interview: \"We cannot accept the world as it is. Each day we should wake up foaming at the mouth because of the injustice of things.\" He was often nominated for the Nobel prize and it is on record that he had given up hope of winning. He did, however, receive numerous Belgian and European prizes for his writing. Claus was also a film-maker, and from 1953 until 1955 he lived in Italy, where his lover and, later first wife, Elly Overzier, acted in films. Overzier bore Claus his first son, Thomas, in 1963. In the early 1970s, he had an affair with Sylvia Kristel, the star of the Emmanuelle films; their son Arthur was born in 1975. Claus married his second wife, Veerle de Wit, in 1993. Often described as a \"contrarian,\" Claus was a writer who might be described as both traditional and experimental, often blending the two to produce powerful messages that, for sympathetic readers, could not be ignored. And in that sense Claus's canvas was, as he describes it in his poem A Woman: 14, a \"landscape of anger\": Don't run from me (lame humans) Meet me, feel me, Crease and break, break, According to his wife, he had chosen euthanasia, which is legal in Belgium, as his agent of death. As the head of the Flemish Literature Fund, Greet Ramael, responded: \"He chose the moment of his death himself. He left life as the proud man he was.\" \u00b7 Hugo Maurice Julien Claus, novelist, poet, painter, playwright and film-maker, born April 5 1929; died March 19 2008"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
