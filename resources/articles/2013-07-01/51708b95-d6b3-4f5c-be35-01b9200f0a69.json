Graeme McDowell called him \"maybe the coolest man alive\". SHOTS OF THE DAY Teenage amateur Jimmy Mullen lofted a Boy's Own dream of a bunker shot straight into the hole on the 15th. And Lee Westwood's eagle putt from off the green at 5 to take the lead at -3 was a game-changer. COLLAPSE OF THE DAY Martin Laird, taking a ruinous quadruple bogey on the third, minutes after joking with his caddie on the way to the 1st tee: \"Do we have enough balls?\" WHINGE OF THE DAY \"The sand is very soft and there's lots of it. The bunkers are a real hazard. They've been created for the balls to stick around the lips. It brings an element of chance into it which I don't love\" \u2013 McDowell, unhappy with sand hazards being hazardous. RIPOSTE OF THE DAY Peter Alliss, weighing up such complaints about the \"unfairness\" of the course. \"That's one of the problems with golf today, everything's supposed to be fair. You're not supposed to go into a bunker and get a bad lie, you're not supposed to end up in a divot, it's not supposed to rain or blow, you're never supposed to have a spike mark in your way, the course should be perfect, prize money for everyone! Muirfield is the way it was, and has been for a couple of hundred years.\" BIG NEWS OF THE DAY Hallamshire Golf Club, revealing their planned festivities to celebrate member Matt Fitzpatrick making the cut: \"The board has decided that the TV will be positioned in the main lounge. In addition, there will be a free finger buffet.\" COMEBACKS OF THE DAY Paul Lawrie and Thongchai Jaidee both left the course on Friday, thinking they had missed the cut. Then it started to drift. Lawrie was walking the dog in Aberdeen when he found out; Jaidee was in London, about to board a flight to Thailand. \"At about 8:45pm I was told that I had a seat in business class and I thought: 'Wow, I'm lucky.' Then my manager called and told me I had to fly back to Edinburgh. This is the first time this has happened to me. But it was fun.\" Lawrie returned with a 70 and Jaidee a 71. AMERICAN OF THE DAY Phil Mickelson \u2013 flying the linguistic stars and stripes by insisting early on that he's still \"putting phenomenal\". THOUGHT FOR THE DAY @GaryLineker \"Things change so quickly in golf \u2026 in a slow sort of way\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
