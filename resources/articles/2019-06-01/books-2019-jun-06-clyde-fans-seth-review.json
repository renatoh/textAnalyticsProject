He calls it \u201cthe biggest book I will ever make\u201d. This collected edition pulls it all together for the first time. It is a deeply realised labour of love. It follows two brothers mired in mutual antagonism from the 1930s to the century\u2019s end. Introspective Simon dreams of drifting unnoticed through life, while bullish Abe\u2019s practised sales patter never quite hides the fractures in his heart. Their father founded Clyde Fans in 1937, when fans were a growing business, before abruptly leaving his family and his firm, and his absence is a wound that festers. Abe takes over, but underestimates the rise of air conditioning, and in the 70s the business crumbles in the face of so much cool air. The narrative captures key moments through the decades: Simon\u2019s one disastrous sales trip, their mother\u2019s departure for a nursing home, Abe\u2019s decision to close a vital parts factory. The 90s is a time of reminiscence, as he sits in the company\u2019s deserted headquarters and looks back on life, contemplating what is left behind as it fades. Time and place have always been central to Seth\u2019s work, and Dominion - the fictional Ontario town that features in Clyde Fans - is both the setting for many of his comics and a set of model buildings, carefully constructed by the artist. Unsurprisingly, Clyde Fans is packed with affectionate detail: models of fans, contemporary adverts, wonderfully realised street scenes and re-creations of the hokey 20s postcards that Simon collects. Several pages scan through the brothers\u2019 late mother\u2019s possessions, giving bygone tat and beauty products the weight of relics. The result is a sad symphony in blue and grey, drawn in a style that harks back to postwar newspaper strips. Thick lines form expressive faces and art deco facades, and panels linger on shadows, empty streets and daily rituals, lending the graphic novel a gentle but compelling rhythm. This is a book about nostalgia and regret, but it finds magic in all manner of places: the creaking boards and shadows of an old building, paper floating under a dark sky, the romance of a miniature golf course at night. Seth presents an idyllic small-town Canada that he and his lonely, melancholic characters, finding solace in the past, know never quite existed. This artful and heartfelt book balances rosiness and realism, making precious fiction from the stuff of ordinary lives. \u2022 Clyde Fans is published by Drawn &amp; Quarterly (\u00a342).
