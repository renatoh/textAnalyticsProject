Happily he is also a man who takes his responsibilities seriously. At a recent meeting of the \"journalism group\", Byford marked director of news Helen Boaden's promotion on to the executive board in a fashion that ensured those present will not quickly forget him. To collective \"alarm\", reports a mole, Byford lit a candle and solemnly handed it to the startled Boaden, entreating her to \"keep the flame of BBC journalism alight\". Boaden is said to have \"flinched\", but politely accepted the candle. After which, we don't doubt, she bore it aloft in a stately procession to her office where, in the manner of an altar votive, dead presidential grave or comical cake decoration, it flickers still. \u2712A welcome reunion for everyone's favourite warring brothers, the Hitchenses, whose fraternal relationship over the years makes Noel and Liam Gallagher resemble a close harmony gospel duo. Not in the flesh, you understand; rather, separate interviews with Mail on Sunday columnist Peter and big brother and literary provocateur Christopher will be screened on Thursday on Sky Arts. (\"They weren't offered the option\" of a joint interview, confides a spokeswoman, perhaps wisely since a face-to-face encounter six years ago, for this newspaper, saw the pair agree only grudgingly even to make eye contact.) It was, evidently, an idyllic childhood: \"I would get on his back and pound heavily ... with my tiny fists and he would claim that it didn't hurt,\" confides Peter. \"I can absolutely assure you that it did, though. I was putting a lot of force into it.\" From Christopher, meanwhile: \"I'm sure I can remember telling him he was adopted, with a reasonable chance he would believe it.\" But with Hitchens the elder now facing inoperable oesophegeal cancer, the pair recently buried a hatchet that has been flailing for decades, and met privately. Christopher cooked, Peter reveals. \"Astonishing. You might as well expect to see Mick Jagger playing crown green bowls.\" The very best of health to them both. \u2712An unhappy tale from Consett, in County Durham, where staff at the Co-operative Funeralcare were assured, following the installation of a large advertising billboard on the side of the funeral home, that \"no insensitive adverts\" would be placed there. And so a pat on the back to the talented individual who considered it a fitting site for a large poster \u2013 reader, it is possible you are ahead of us \u2013 advertising The Walking Dead, a post-apocalyptic TV series in which shuffling hordes of decomposing zombies have taken over smalltown America, chasing a straggling group of humans \u2013 including Egg from This Life \u2013 into an ever more desperate battle for survival. If you were making arrangements for a loved one's funeral, said one local, \"it could be very upsetting\". Clear Channel UK, which owns the site, has called the placement \"unfortunate\". \u2712Onwards to today's extract from the Diary book of the week, a feature which has been a huge hit with readers, judging from the rapt silence with which it has been greeted. Once again, we turn expectantly to Kate \u2013 Kate Middleton: Princess in Waiting, by Claudia Joseph, where our reading sees the heroine leaving school and heading to Florence to learn about Italian and share a flat with Chris Rea's niece. On one fateful evening at the Caf\u00e9 des Artistes, we learn, Kate is \"sipping a glass of wine\" when rumours begin circulating that Prince William may come to Florence. \"Friends\" say \"she seem[s] blase about the news\"; just as well since he would shortly fly to Patagonia. \"Over the next eight months\", Joseph reveals, \"Kate did some more travelling. Some reports indicate that she had been in Chile during her gap year, although when or what she was doing there is not known \u2013 and nor is whether this was definitely the case.\" Join us tomorrow for the final instalment, when our scene shifts to the University of St Andrews and His Royal Highness finally claps eyes on her common lowness. It's a fairytale."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
