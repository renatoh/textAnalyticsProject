Trainer Howard Johnson's six-year-old arrived with a tall reputation having won his last three starts in Irish point-to-points and a Gowran Park bumper in April. After that win he was bought from the Wexford trainer John Berry for a six-figure sum by Johnson's big-spending patron Graham Wylie. Yesterday Bewleys Berry was backed as if defeat was out of the question and went off at 8-13 in the opener over an extended two miles. The powerfully built chestnut won as he liked: in fact, Johnson gives Wylie's big-money recruits a daunting 50% strike rate on their first starts over jumps. \"He's a lovely horse, a proper racehorse and will make a right good chaser,\" said Johnson. \"We'll keep him to novice hurdles and then go chasing next season. He hasn't got the speed like Arcalis, but Arcalis is a two-miler while this fellow could go over three miles.\" And the news of Arcalis, another big Wylie buy, is that he is set to reappear at the weekend. The four-year-old strolled home on his debut at Ayr last week after six Flat wins including the John Smith's Cup at York in July. Johnson said: \"Arcalis will go to Newcastle on Saturday, but he must have good ground. Hopefully Tony Dobbin will be able to ride - I will not run him unless he can.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
