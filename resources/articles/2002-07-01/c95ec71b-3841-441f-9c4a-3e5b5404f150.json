A straight-talking operator, with little patience for elected politicians, Pickering, 53, was born to working class parents in York. His route to the NAPF included 20 years' experience in the tough environment of the Electrical Electronic Telecommunication and Plumbing Union. On record as calling for the retirement age to be raised to 70 by 2030 to rectify the crisis in pensions, Pickering has always been upfront about its causes. \"People need to appreciate that you can't work from 25 to 55 and then live the life of Riley to 95,\" he told one interviewer. Pickering has been blind for 20 years, but in interviews has described this as \"a characteristic, not a disability\". He took the helm at the NAPF in 1999, when many occupational funds were still reaping the rewards of the dotcom boom, and pensions were low down the news agenda. By the time he left last year, falling markets and the exodus from final salary to defined contribution schemes had sparked talk of a \"pensions crisis\". A partner at Watson Wyatt, one of the \"big four\" actuarial firms, since 1992, Pickering won friends in government when, as NAPF chairman, he embraced the Treasury's earlier proposals for pension reform in the Myners review, published last spring. As well as being a big-hitter on the British pensions stage, Pickering was appointed chairman of the European Federation of Retirement Provision in October last year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
