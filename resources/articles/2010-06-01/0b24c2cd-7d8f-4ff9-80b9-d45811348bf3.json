In truth, the opening show of what will be the final series on Channel 4 (after falling ratings and rising criticism) brought to mind a more low-brow and contemporary adjective: Cowell-esque. For the first time in its decade on air, the series televised the audition process that will choose the people who will compete for regional pantomimes at Christmas 2012. This move felt like a belated acknowledgement that the franchise had missed a trick spotted by Cowell's audition formats: why wait a whole week for the first rejection when people can be kicked out from the beginning? Accordingly, Davina was found surrounded by a shoutier crowd within the usual shouty crowd outside the house. This was the longlist of 81, from which the disembodied voice of Big Brother announced the 13 housemates. The show used a circus theme. Initially, it was not clear why but then we realised the whole apparatus of big tops and rollercoasters was to allow the hostess a dirty joke about who would \"enter Big Brother's ring\". The lucky 13 were phased in a way that deliberately seemed to play with the audience's expectations. The first of the 81 to be called, Josie, waggled her breasts at the camera and squealed \"Omigod!\" repeatedly in the way that Big Brother has helped to introduce to the national vocabulary. Subsequent entrants at least varied the template: including a posh medical student called Sunshine, Ben who's a \"journalist and broadcaster\" and Steve, an ex-soldier and father of eight, who lost his legs in a roadside bomb blast. As Steve limped in, a member of the crowd seemed to shout \"Lose!\", an example of the pointless nastiness introduced to TV by this series after a promising beginning, in 2000, with the first series providing genuine psychological insight. The war veteran was not the only contender to be disliked on sight. \"Guess what? I got booed as well,\" one new arrival consoled another. The biggest visual surprise was Dave, the first ever entrant to the house to stalk up the catwalk in a monk's cassock. He claimed to be a Christian minister, although he said he was into \"heavenly intoxication\" and \"getting sloshed\". With the 13 in, McCall pulled the first surprise, announcing that a 14th housemate would be chosen from the rejected 68. Channelling another TV format that will outlive it, Big Brother staged a national lottery, picking a name at random from a tombola. Again, this seemed largely intended to permit the presenter a crack about \"Big Brother's balls\". This final competitor, Mario, has been sent into the house as a mole, charged with betraying the other players. It will be a long summer: McCall revealed that the winner this time will stay in the house and compete with champions of the past. One of the contestants is a wannabe movie director who calls herself Shabby. Even if she gets expelled in week one, this feels like a series that will have her name written all over it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
