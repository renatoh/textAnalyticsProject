But it was never a realistic hope. Too much of America's history and ideological ferment pushes the other way. They were reminded in the flap over the incendiary remarks of the Illinois senator's former pastor that white racism is not the only hurdle to overcome. In fact, Obama's campaign may come to represent not the culmination of the civil rights movement but its failures. Here you had perhaps the ideal black presidential candidate to make a run at the White House. His education, political savvy and background should have allowed him to escape the trajectory of previous African American politicians and candidates. Instead, Obama had to answer questions and deliver a speech about why he was standing by his old friend, come what may, even though he disagrees with the Rev Jeremiah Wright about a great many things. Such as? Oh, those chickens coming home to roost, and whether the US government had intentionally introduced the Aids epidemic to hurt blacks, and also the wisdom of uttering the phrase \"God damn America\" from the pulpit. Many white Americans were incredulous that Obama would choose to place himself under this man's spiritual leadership. As his rival Hillary Clinton put it, Wright most certainly would not have been her pastor. Those same would-be voters were then treated to the explanation by Obama's spinners on cable news programs that the reverend's views are really not all that \"out there\" in the black community. The spinners had a point. Wright's conspiracy-tinged, grievance-laden worldview found a ready market in Chicago's black neighborhoods. Trinity United Church of Christ had a handful of members when he took it over in the early 1970s; about 10,000 this year when he retired. From the video clips of Wright's sermons, we can see what they reacted to. In one bit, he cast Jesus as a persecuted black man and the Romans as the dreaded European white power structure. The crowd ate it up. The most charitable explanation for Obama's membership in Trinity United is a cynical one. As an Ivy League-educated outsider with political aspirations, he needed the votes of its members and the street cred that attending the church would give him in the black community. But he has already banked those votes and is a shoo-in for reelection to his Senate seat, at the very least. And yet, Obama chose to stand by Wright and the church he built up because he felt his hand had been forced. He cast the proposed abandonment of the preacher as essentially a betrayal of who he (Obama) was. In his Philadelphia speech, the Illinois senator defended black grievances even while conceding that the angry white reaction to increased crime and affirmative action is also \"legitimate,\" if misdirected. He argued that poor whites, blacks, and Hispanics should team up to bring corporate power to heel, but offered only rhetorical concessions for why non-black voters should sign on. Obama may well be the eventual nominee of his party. He could even end up president. But his failure to push for policies that are any different than those dictated by typical Democratic interest group calculation will have serious ramifications. It will mean that one big reason for many idealistic voters supporting him is be null and void. On race relations, we'll have still more of the same - with national health care thrown in. Can I add, I hope that doesn't happen. While researching my new book, The Warm Bucket Brigade, I became morbidly curious with the decline of the post-civil war Republicans. Here the reader of history could see a party, which had clearly been in the right, lean on its own moral superiority so hard that the crutch snapped. The old Republican coalition devolved into graft and bloody shirt waving and election stealing, and was eventually rejected by voters. The Republicans' failure then led to the fall of Reconstruction in the South, and the rise of Jim Crow. The civil rights movement wasn't able to raise blacks back to the class of fully vested America citizens until about a century later. Now, the inheritors of that movement - both black and white - are at a turning point. They need to decide whether they want a politics of grievance or one of reconciliation.
