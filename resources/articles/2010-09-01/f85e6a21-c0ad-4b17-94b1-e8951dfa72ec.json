Deep breath. Perhaps even a stiff drink. It's time to discuss Ann Widdecombe's transition from toxic Tory diehard to living national treasure. Consider the evidence. She's no longer an MP. She loves cuddly animals (a rare anti-hunting Tory who lists Buttercups Goat Sanctuary as one of her favourite causes can't be all bad). She's been asked onto Strictly Come Dancing \u2013 and admits she's the pantomime act. She makes jokes: \"I have no raunchy side. I told producers 'what I wouldn't show the pope, I won't show the audience. And I would show the pope very little'.\" At least one randomly selected website has declared her to be a gay icon. She writes for the Guardian these days. She probably annoys David Cameron. And Nick Clegg. She turned down an offer of a job as Britain's ambassador to the Vatican. Michael Howard doesn't like her. She once dressed as a miner and went down a coal mine when fighting Burnley as a Tory candidate. She's a campaigner for prison education. It wasn't easy being an outspoken female politician in the Conservative party. Or the Commons. She appeared in Doctor Who. Her parliamentary expenses were very low. She isn't being paid an appearance fee for this column. She didn't complain when a Guardian review described her first novel as \"a piece of moralising masquerading as fiction of the most mediocre sort\". She almost certainly can't dance. She'll probably be the last contestant to be voted off the show. She is, like it or not, unforgettable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
