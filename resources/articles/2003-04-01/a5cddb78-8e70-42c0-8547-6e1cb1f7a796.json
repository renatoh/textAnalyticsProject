Fortunate not to be sent off when he handled outside the box and glad to see a clearance of his strike Roberto Carlos and go wide. But twice made saves from the Brazilian full-back. 6/10 Gary Neville Might wish he had been closer to Figo for the first goal. Read play neatly on a couple of occasions to prevent further damage but struggled in the second half and will miss the return leg 5 Rio Ferdinand Suffered against Ronaldo and Raul at the heart of the defence. He lost Raul for the second goal and was beaten by Ronaldo when the Brazilian went on a forceful run. 5 Wes Brown Not a night he will remember. He was beaten by a Zidane trick in the build-up to Figo's goal, was very lucky not to concede a penalty when he tripped Ronaldo and was thankful that Barthez saved him the embarrassment of an own-goal. 4 Mikael Silvestre Forced off before the hour mark by a knee injury which hampered his effectiveness in the second half. Had some bright moments going forward before the interval, when he went on the overlap whenever possible. 5 David Beckham Not the evening he would have liked. Could not be faulted for industry, getting back to help Neville and looking to get into the Real box to support Van Nistelrooy, but no killer passes among some neat distribution. Wasted a chance to make it 3-2. 5 Nicky Butt Spent plenty of time chasing shadows Should have been quicker to close down Raul when the forward scored No3 from the edge of the penalty area. More assertive in attacking areas before the interval than might have been anticipated. 5 Roy Keane Use of the ball could not be faulted as United sought a way back. Made important challenges, but could not offer the defensive shield or forward breaks which might have made this a happier night. 6 Ryan Giggs A thoroughly peripheral figure wide on the left in the first half. Brighter when he got into central areas more often in the second half, having a shot saved which led to Van Nistelrooy's goal. 4 Paul Scholes Will be kicking himself over the error which cost United the second goal, giving away possession near the edge of his box. Misses the second leg after being cautioned. Did a decent job going forward, having an early shot saved. Played on the left in the second half and drifted in to contribute but to less effect. 5 Ruud van Nistelrooy Led the line bravely in difficult circumstances. Could have had more than his one goal but how important might that single close-range header prove? Chased hard in the first half, when he had to operate as a lone forward. Generally used the ball sensibly. 6 Substitutes John O'Shea Second-half replacement for Silvestre. Delivered a couple of useful crosses. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer On for Gary Neville but too late to make an impression"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
