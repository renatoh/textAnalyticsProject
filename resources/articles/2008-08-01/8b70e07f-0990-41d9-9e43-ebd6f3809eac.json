It worked a treat on her folksy 2003 debut, but here she mopes between MOR flavours; cafe swing, string quartet, dreary waltzes and faux blues. The songs have their moments, but their creator sounds as sulkily uninvolved as a model at a boorish party."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
