Like Richard's opening gambit, it's fairly simple: Chelsea are 3-1 down after the first leg. A 2-0 win would be enough to see them book a place in the final against Porto. A 3-1 win would ensure extra time, after which the match will be decided by a silver goal or penalties. William Gallas returns from illness to take his place alongside John Terry at the heart of Chelsea's defence, while Jimmy FLoyd Hasselbaink and Joe Cole have finally whined their way into the Chelsea starting XI. After all their moaning this season, I'll be expecting them to deliver and shall be highly amused if they don't. 1 min: Chelsea in blue ... Monaco in red and white ... loud music ... handshakes etc. Chelsea kick off playing from right to left. After a mere 40 seconds, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink pounces on a defensive error, makes room for a shot and scuffs a tame effort straight at Flavio Roma in the Monaco goal. What a start that would have been for Chelsea. \"I thought you'd like to know I am at work, have the Undertones first album on at a suitable volume (headphones of course) and am all set for a great match,\" writes Howard Davies, who has very serious ego problems if he thinks I give a monkey's how he idles his way through the working day. I can't let the moment pass without commenting on how very punk it is of Howard to play The Undertones at work ... with the headphones on. You're really sticking it to The Man there, aren't you Howard? Yep, I'm even crankier tonight as a result of picking up some manner of bronchial infection type thing. You have been warned. 2 mins: A punt from Flavio Roma goes straight to his opposite number, Cudicini. Both teams are playing 4-4-2. Interestingly, just three of this season's signings are playing for Chelsea. Well, I think it's interesting. 4 mins: Monaco attack through Giuly, but Wayne Bridge tidies up in the left-back berth and strokes the ball forward. Hasselbaink comes for it and doesn't get it. 6 mins: \"I'd like it to be known that I am not, never have been or never will be a Chelsea fan and I would love for them to lose tonight. The way they have treated Ranieri is a disgrace,\" writes Ben Jilbert from California. 7 mins: Apart from Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink's early miss, there's been no shots on goal so far. Any time Chelsea win possession, Monaco quickly settle back into their starting formation and prepare to soak up the pressure. In just such an instance, Cole attempts to cross from the left wing but he doesn't beat the first man and Hugo Ibarra heads clear. 10 mins: After a delightful Chelsea move involving seven players and lots of short passing, Jesper Gronkjaer loses his footing and the ball out on the right wing, deep in Monaco territory. In a flash, Monaco counter, attacking the Mario Melchiot-shaped hole left in Chelsea's defence from their last sortie. Morientes shoots, but his feeble effort is no match for Carlo Cudicini. 13 mins: Sustained Chelsea pressure results in two corners. Nothing comes of either, although Falvio Roma in the Monaco goal does show signs that he might be suffering from what is known in the trade as \"a dose of the Lehmanns\". 15 mins: Joe Cole fluffs a brilliant chance to put Chelsea ahead. In the Monaco goal, Roma could only parry a thunderous drive from Geremi. The ball fell to Cole and with all the time in the world at his disposal, he scewed a relatively simple chance horribly wide. Dreadful finishing from the under-achiever who thinks he should start and finish every match for Chelsea. 16 mins: Under pressure from Patrice Evra, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink brings an excellent save out of Roma at the near post, and injures the Monaco defender in the process. Chelsea are certainly making the chances they need, but their inability to convert them could be their undoing. 19 mins: Geremi attempts to cross twice in quick succession from the left wing. His first effort is blocked by Sebastien Squillachi, his second effort goes wide, much to the displeasure of the scowling Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink. There's a lot of ball going to waste out there on the left hand side of the sward - how Chelsea could do with Damien Duff. After being patched up on the sideline, Patrice Evra returns to the field. 21 mins: GOAL: Chelsea 1 - 0 Monaco (Agg: 2-3) Jesper Gronkjaer puts Chelsea ahead with what looked suspiciously like an attempted cross. Out on the right wing, he cut inside and looped the ball across the penalty area, over Flavio Roma's head and in under the angle of cross-bar and far post . If it was Ronaldinho I'd be inclined to say he meant it, but as it was Jesper, I'm going to hazard a guess that it was a fluke. 25 mins: A low drive from Morientes rifles through a crowded Chelsea penalty area, takes a small deflection, smashes off an upright and bounces out. A real let-off for Chelsea. 28 mins: Not sure what happened, as I was in the throes of a bout of death-rattle coughing. Nobody's scored, so don't worry - you haven't missed anything too important. And before you all mail in to ask ... don't worry, I'm fine. I know how concerned you all get. 30 mins: Eidur Gudjohnsen misses a glorious scoring chance, heading across the goal and wide, when it must have been easier to score. Awful. 34 mins: Eidur Gudjohnsen attempts to thread two consecutive passes through the Monaco defence towards Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink in the space of a few seconds. The first should have gone to Joe Cole, who was in acres of space on the left, while Hasselbaink was unable to run on to the second one. 35 mins: Not far outside the Monaco six-yard box, Frank Lampard chests the ball down - and in one fluid movement - swivels and drives a volley goal-wards. In Monaco's goal, Flavio Roma flings himself low to his right and puts the ball around his right-hand post for a corner. A great effort, stopped by a fantastic save. 38 mins: Chelsea need a minimum of two goals tonight. Having scored one and missed at least five splendid scoring opportunities so far, it shouldn't be beyond them. For Monaco, Patrice Evra is booked for jostling Jesper Gronkjaer off the ball unfairly. Moments later, having been put through, Fernando Morientes slots one of the easiest chances you'll ever see wide. With finishing like that, he should be playing for Chelsea. 43 mins: GOAL Chelsea 2 - 0 Monaco (Agg: 3-3) Frank Lampard scores a peach to put Chelsea in the driving seat of this tie just before half time. On the end of a rampaging run, he swapped passes with Gudjohnsen on the edge of the box before curling the ball around Flavio Roma from about 12 yards. 45+1mins: GOAL Chelsea 2 - 1 Monaco (Agg: 3-4) Monaco's right back Hugo Ibarra bundles a looping Fernando Morientes header in at the far post. The move came about after Rothen skinned Mario Melchiot down the left wing, and pulled a neat cross back from the byline. Interestingly. Ibarra was actually leaning against the post at the time and the ball may have bounced in off his arm rather than his head. In goal for Chelsea, Carlo Cudicini went absolutely ballistic with the referee and linesman. Advantage Monaco. Half-time SEcond half: Monaco get the second half underway, but Chelsea win possession and attack. After brilliant work on the edge of Monaco's six-yard box, Wayne Bridge rolls the ball towards Gudjohnsen. A slight deflection tees the ball up perfectly for the Icelandic international, but he swivels and kicks a big boot-full of fresh air. If a four-year-old did it you'd laugh at him. Absolutely useless. 47 mins: Chelsea win a free-kick wide on the right, where Monaco midfielder Lucas Bernardi gets booked for time-wasting. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink swings in a good cross, which John Terry gets his head to at the far post. Alas, his contact was poor and he skies the ball over the bar. 48 mins: Wayne Bridge picks up the ball on the left, pelts down the wing, cuts inside and shoots an optimistic effort way over the bar. 50 mins: Whose turn is it to miss a sitter for Chelsea? Step up to the plate Mr Jesper Gronkjaer. With nobody near him and a gaping expanse of goal to aim at, he sweeps a beautiful John Terry cross over the bar. If Chelsea miss out tonight, their players are bound to waffle on with the usual guff about not getting the rub of the green. Rest assured they've had plenty of good luck tonight - most of which they wasted. 53 mins: During all the excitement of Chelsea barn-door/cow's ar*e/banjo festival, I forgot to mention that Monaco have brought on a substitutue for the second half. The Czech, Plasil replaces Sebastien Squillachi. 56 mins: Jerome Rothen gets booked. 57 mins: Monaco's West Ham reject Eduoard Cisse goes down injured. While he's receiving treatment for what I suspect may not be an entirely genuine ailment, Chelsea skipper John Terry walks around trying to rally his troops. Given the wasters he's playing with, he might as well try getting blood out of a lettuce. When play resumes, Wayne Bridge thunders down the left wing and sends in a sub-standard cross that's no use to man or beast. 58 mins: GOAL Chelsea 2 - 2 Monaco (Agg: 3-5) After a sizzling piece of interpassing that eviscerated the Chelsea midfield and defence, Morientes picks up the ball just inside the Chelsea box and slots it home through Carlo Cudicini's legs. Chelsea only need - lengthy pause as Baz gets confused by the permutations - three goals to win it now. 63 mins: The tinkering begins. For Chelsea, Glen Johnson replaces Mario Melchiot. No matter what happens, there cannot be extra time in this match now. That's bad news for Chelsea, but excellent news for me. 65 mins:More death-rattling from your bronchially traumatised minute-by-minute commentator. My apologies for the shoddy service, but it's certainly no worse than that provided by Messrs Gronkjaer, Gudjohnsen, Hasselbaink and assorted others on the Chelsea team. For example, I think Joe Cole is still on the field, but I couldn't be certain. If he is he certainly isn't doing anything worthwhile. 69 mins: Chelsea substitutions: Crespo for Hasselbaink and Parker for Geremi. Monaco substitution: the excellent Dado Prso for his skipper Ludovic Giuly. You want to see Crespo's hair - it looks like a bubble perm gone wrong. 71 mins: The Chelsea supporters are lifting the roof off the stands in an attempt to gee their team on. No wonder footballers are spoilt and pampered - they completely blow an excellent chance to make the Champions League final through nothing other than their own ineptitude and they're still the subject of adoration. 73 mins: \"Not many mails today - are you in a grump because of your cough, or is there nobody out there?\" writes Matthew Cobb, who appears not to have noticed that it's been kind of busy in this second half. To answer your question, Matthew, I'm being subjected to the usual deluge, but I've decided to exercise a bit more quality control. The Howard Davies of this world seem to have got it into their head that any old balderdash will get them the highly sought-after mention they so disturbingly get their kicks from. Not any more!!! Meanwhile away from my high horse, Chelsea haven't missed a sitter in five minutes. An improvement, but one I suspect may have come to late. 78 mins: Jesper Gronkjaer, who is having an absolute shocker in this second half, gets the ball on the right wing and sends in one of the worst attempts at a cross I've ever seen. How much do these bozos get paid? My apologies to those of you who can't see the game, but I just don't have the necessary words in my vocabulary to describe how appalling Chelsea have been tonight. 80 mins: Monaco substitution: Morientes off. Didn't see who went on, as I was too mesmerised by the glare of Glen Johnsen's studs as he attempted to cut Jerome Rothen in half with a wild tackle. Just when we thought Chelsea couldn't get any worse ... 85 mins: The best email I've ever received from Mike Gover who, with no apparent trace of irony, says: \"I've noticed a couple of similarities between your commentary and that of soccernet.com? Random coincidence perhaps?\" I'm not sure whther you're accusing me of copying them, or them of copying me, Michael. However, I suspect any similarities you have noticed are probably more to do with the fact that we are actually describing the same match. Ibarra tries a shot from distance, which goes a good three feet wide. Monaco are given a corner, although no Chelsea player touched it. 90 mins: Let it end lord. Let it end. 90+1 mins: Dado Prso attempts to adjust his body to get on the end of a Jerome Rothen cross. As impressive and seductive as his 70s-disco hip-shimmying is, he makes a mess of it and misjudges the bounce of the ball. Monaco are just playing down the clock now and, as many of you have written in to point out, so am I. 90+2 mins: Peep! Peep! Peep! Chelsea are out of the Champions League. For all their fresh financial backing this season, their team of wasters has completely squandered the best opportunity they'll ever have of getting into a Champions League final. Twice.
