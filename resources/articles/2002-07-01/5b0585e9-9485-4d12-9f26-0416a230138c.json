But now it is the history writers who are heaving their quills. Painkillers and the physiotherapy table were summoned and yesterday he returned from the second round having shot 69 (after 68 in the first), to announce only a little residual groin pain and that his odds to win the title had been cut from 200-1 to 40-1. In public at least Smyth is still saying he does not \"want to think about winning\", but if victory were to come in this his 22nd - and possibly final - Open, at 49 he would become the oldest ever winner of a major title. Sixteen months after becoming the oldest ever winner on the European Tour after triumph in the Madeira Island Open, he goes into the third round on five under par. \"I love this tournament and if I have a chance to win I'll go for it,\" he said. \"But my first hurdle was to make the cut and I've done that. Now the top 15 is the next target so I can come back next year. Anything else is a bonus.\" Smyth has good reason not to want to think about the possibility of victory, of course. \"I had a chance once upon a time in 1982,\" he said. \"I say 'once upon a time' because that's how they usually start old stories.\" That was at Troon, and in his best ever Open he had the chance of tying with Tom Watson. He needed to par the last eight holes to do so. Instead he finished fourth. \"I remember being in the middle of the fairway at the 14th, a couple of shots off the lead,\" he said yesterday, \"and I turned to my caddie and said, 'I'm going for the pin'. But I don't regret doing it. I'm not saying I'll have a chance but, if I did, I'd go for it again.\" Certainly plenty of that determination was in evidence yesterday, when the Irishman collected three birdies on the outward nine, two at the fifth and ninth par fives and a two at the 185-yard 7th. But this was no hit-and-run. For Smyth the 7,034-yard, par- 71 Muirfield course, with its heathery rough and slim fairways, was ideal for players like him who did not rely on hitting big. \"A lot of the golf courses we play give such an advantage to power hitters,\" he said. \"I hit the ball a decent distance, 270 or 280. But, when you're standing next to a guy who's hitting 315 yards and he's hitting a six-iron on to a par-five and you can't reach it, it's a huge advantage.\" Smyth has been contesting British Opens since 1975. But he has never been to the Masters, US Open or PGA Championship because his results have never been good enough to qualify. Whatever happens at Muirfield this weekend he has already made up his mind to enter the senior ranks next season. The oldest-ever winner of a major was American Julius Boros; he won the 1968 US PGA title at 48."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
