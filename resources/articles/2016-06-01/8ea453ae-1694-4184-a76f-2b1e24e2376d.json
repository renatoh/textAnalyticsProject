The concessions, intended to meet concerns raised by the parliamentary intelligence and security committee (ISC) as well as by Labour, Liberal Democrat and backbench Tory critics, include the introduction of a privacy clause designed to ensure that the new mass surveillance powers are not authorised in situations where less intrusive means could be used. The two-day Commons report stage of the investigatory powers bill, which will extend the powers of the security services, is scheduled for Monday and Tuesday next week. It will be the last substantive piece of parliamentary business before the EU referendum in three weeks\u2019 time. The home secretary\u2019s concessions also cover protection for journalists, the Wilson doctrine on shielding MPs from snooping, and the retention and use of \u201cbulk personal datasets\u201d such as medical records. The ISC, chaired by the former Conservative attorney general Dominic Grieve, and parliament\u2019s joint human rights committee, chaired by the former Labour cabinet minister Harriet Harman, have also tabled amendments to the bill demanding much tougher safeguards preventing the powers from being abused. The ISC in particular demanded that privacy protections should be made an overarching part of the bill. The bill not only enshrines in law the bulk data collection and mass computer and phone-hacking operations carried out by GCHQ, which were revealed by the whistleblower Edward Snowden in 2013, but also extends the security services\u2019 powers to track everyone\u2019s web history by introducing internet connection records that can be stored for 12 months and that can be accessed by the police and security services. The new Home Office concessions include: \u2022 Privacy: a new clause that makes clear that warrants and other authorisations should not be granted where the information could reasonably be obtained by less intrusive means. The clause makes explicit the implicit privacy safeguards in the bill and puts \u201cbeyond doubt\u201d that there will be severe penalties for those who deliberately misuse the powers. \u2022 Protection for journalists: clarification that the judicial commissioner will be required to consider \u2018the overriding public interest\u2019 when authorising the use of communications data to identify a journalist\u2019s sources. \u2022 Wilson doctrine: prime minister must give explicit approval for law enforcement agencies to hack into MPs\u2019 phones and computer as well as to access their communications data. \u2022 Bulk personal datasets and medical records: the legal test needed to retain and examine these highly personal records is to be raised to \u201cexceptional and compelling\u201d cases only. A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cWe have always been clear that we will listen to the constructive views of politicians from all sides of the House to ensure the passage of this important bill. We have said the government will be bringing forward amendments at report stage and are willing to consider amendments that are in the interest of both improving the bill and of demonstrating the necessity of the powers it contains.\u201d Labour has already secured from May a commitment to an independent review of the operational case for bulk personal data collection and hacking powers by Britain\u2019s watchdog on terrorism laws, David Anderson, and protection from surveillance for legitimate trade union activities. However, Labour intends to press for further changes, including stronger safeguards in five areas: privacy, using internet connection records only in serious crime cases, toughening rules on the judicial authorisation of intercept warrants, stronger safeguards on the use of medical records and other bulk datasets, and protections for legal and journalistic confidentiality. The Liberal Democrats, who could prove influential when the bill reaches the Lords, have tabled amendments that would remove \u201cinternet connection records\u201d \u2013 tracking everyone\u2019s web use \u2013 from the bill and that would ensure that people who are the targets of unlawful surveillance are told what data of theirs has been accessed so they can seek redress. The Liberal Democrats\u2019 home affairs spokesman, Alistair Carmichael, said the ISC told May to go away and rewrite the bill to include a dedicated section on privacy: \u201cInstead she re-labelled the title \u2018General Protections\u2019 to \u2018General Privacy Protections\u2019, a one-word aesthetic addition that fools no one. That is why the Liberal Democrats will continue to fight, both in the Commons and Lords, for privacy to form the backbone of this legislation. \u201cTheresa May\u2019s concession allowing for an independent review into bulk powers is welcome but this goes nowhere near far enough. Too many of the proposals in the bill are vaguely drafted and disproportionate; for example, we are clear that proposals to collect and store everyone\u2019s web histories for 12 months has to go. We should be equipping our police and security services with the resources they need, not drowning them in data,\u201d he said. A report by the parliamentary joint human rights committee published on Thursday welcomes the \u201cdirection of travel\u201d in the bill but proposes further safeguards. The committee\u2019s chair, Harriet Harman, said: \u201cThe bill provides a clear and transparent basis for powers already in use by the security and intelligence services, but there need to be further safeguards. \u201cProtection for MPs\u2019 communications from unjustified interference is vital, as it is for confidential communications between lawyers and clients, and for journalists\u2019 sources. The bill must provide tougher safeguards to ensure that the government cannot abuse its powers to undermine parliament\u2019s ability to hold the government to account.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
