Nobody knows what fate will greet the former England spin bowler tomorrow; whether a new career as star of stage and screen, or several years of media overexposure and psychotherapy bills. In 10 days' time \"Tuffers\" will be joined in the unblinking gaze of the public eye by the cast of Big Brother 4 (or, to give it the numerals it deserves, IV). In fact, there are now so many reality TV shows that a point may soon be reached when everyone will live at least part of their lives under the permanent glare of the cameras. As the possibility of finding oneself a contestant increases, it is all the more important to find out what the movies can teach us about how to deal with the experience. The first lesson to draw would have to be this: don't do it. Whatever the temptations of cash prizes or instant celebrity, the movies are very clear that putting your life up on the small screen can only be to the detriment of your humanity. The Truman Show may have turned out to be a mawkish comedy-drama, but it was intended as a savage satire on the increasing influence of TV on our lives. You could tell it was a serious film because Jim Carrey was barely allowed to roll his eyes as he puzzled over why all his friends were cardboard cut-outs in sta-prest slacks. Truman Burbank was particularly unfortunate because his entire life was a reality show. Thanks to the conspiracies of viewers across the world and the cunning set design of puppetmaster and producer Christof (Ed Harris, with appropriately menacing beret), Truman is kept from realising his true state until the denouement of the film when he discovers a door in the middle of the sky. In the film, this development is used to elicit sympathy from the audience. If Wayne Sleep were to have done the same thing in I'm A Celebrity, ITV would presumably have demanded a drug test. As Truman had no choice in the matter, his life as TV is afforded a happy ending. There is no such outcome for the stars of My Little Eye, perhaps the most needlessly depressing horror flick since Jason X (Friday 13th part 10). The premise is that five contestants sign up to appear in a reality show broadcast over the web. If they all stay in the house for six months each contestant gets a million dollars. Sadly, when the time comes to collect their prize money, they're all dead. While each of the contestants has their own foible - one is too greedy, one too vain, another just too dull - the moral of the story appears to be that aspiring to fame is not smart, as your celebrity will be defined by those who watch you. And if that happens to be a small coterie of wealthy human-being hunters, then tough. With shots frequently taken through the eye of the big brother camera, or sound effects skewed by the hidden microphones, My Little Eye encourages you, the audience, to assess your role as voyeur in the whole reality experience. While such philosophical contemplation can only be welcome, you can't help spending more time wondering why on earth these five studly twenty-somethings would decamp to a secret location without ever signing an insurance disclaimer, still less talking to a lawyer. Astonishingly, My Little Eye is not even the nadir of the silver screen reality TV experience; everyone dies, but at least that wasn't part of the deal from the outset, as it is in Series 7: The Contenders, where each of the contestants is given a gun and challenged to be the last on his feet. The overwhelming conclusion of the movies is that fame hurts, and reality TV is where you start paying. An odd message to come from the Hollywood machine, you might think, but if it makes us focus our ambitions on those closest to us it can't be too bad a thing. Perhaps we should seek celebrity and approbation among our own friends and family, rather than among millions of strangers. As one of the contestants in My Little Eye says - shortly before suffocating another with a plastic bag - \"you're always primetime somewhere\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
