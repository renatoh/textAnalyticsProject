But at least Run Lola Run had zip. This, I'm afraid, is a terrible disappointment, and that flatulent, orotund title is the first tip-off that something is very wrong. Franka Potente, Tykwer's favourite leading lady, is Sissi, a psychiatric nurse who gets hit by a tanker lorry in the street. Benno F\u00fcrmann is a disturbed ex-soldier who saves her life by giving her a tracheotomy - with fateful results. This is a long and tiring film, with no real fire to the narrative or clarity in the characterisation. Tykwer's diffuse story is supposed to be held together with cosmic correspondences, but they are just nebulous and dull. Finally, Sissi and Benno become a sort of Germanic Thelma and Louise. But at least Thelma and Louise had the decency to die at the end."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
