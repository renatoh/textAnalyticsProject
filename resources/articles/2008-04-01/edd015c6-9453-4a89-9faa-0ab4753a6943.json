There was too much lazing about, he said, and too many late nights - or, more accurately, early mornings. But the recordings that come out of the concerts never suggest there was any slackness in the music-making. EMI's latest collection of Lugano recordings is one of the best so far, largely because it is dominated by the great lady herself - and because this is clearly the atmosphere in which Argerich is most relaxed and able to give of her dazzling, inspirational best. On the first of the discs, Argerich appears in three roles. She partners Renaud Capu\u00e7on and Mischa Maisky in an edge-of-the-seat account of Beethoven's D major Piano Trio, the Ghost; the unremittingly high-voltage playing may not be to every taste. She also joins Lilya Zilberstein and Gabriela Montero for quicksilver accounts of - respectively - Busoni's Fantasie f\u00fcr Eine Orgelwalze, and Schumann's rarely heard Andante and Variations. The disc ends with Schumann's Kinderszenen. Her playing is more self-consciously poetic than her famous studio recording from the early 1980s, but still peerless and precious. There's more Argerich later in the set, too, combining with Capu\u00e7on in a magnificently intense performance of Bart\u00f3k's First Violin Sonata, and playing Ravel's Mother Goose suite and Lutoslawski's Paganini Variations. While the works in which she is not involved - including Beethoven's early D major Piano Quartet, Glinka's Grand Sextet and Dohnanyi's Piano Quintet No 1 - do not generate the same level of excitement, standards remain very high, with some exceptional playing, especially from pianist Karin Lechner and violinist Alissa Margulis. All the performances convey a sense of sheer enjoyment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
