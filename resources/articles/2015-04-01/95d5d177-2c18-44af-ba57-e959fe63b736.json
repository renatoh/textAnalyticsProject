We haven't'", "bodyText": "In Bradford, fans were reeling from the revelations in Martin Fletcher\u2019s book, many angry at what they saw as unnecessary muck-raking. At the time of the blaze on 11 May 1985, Alan Wintersgill was financial director of Tebro, the soft toy company run by Stafford Heginbotham, Bradford City\u2019s flamboyant chairman. Then 34, Wintersgill was at the fateful match, sitting in the directors\u2019 box with Heginbotham\u2019s family. His father was in the stands and was burnt, but survived. Wintersgill is adamant that three of the eight fires said by Fletcher to be linked to Heginbotham were indisputably not Heginbotham\u2019s fault. The first of these three was at the five-storey Douglas Mills on Manchester road in 1977. He claimed a young man called John Disley admitted arson and was prosecuted. Two further fires, in 1981 and 1982 or 1983, hit a single-storey unit next to Douglas Mills occupied by a company called AB Plastics. Heginbotham had sold the unit by the time it went up in flames, according to Wintersgill. Mike Harrison, editor of City Gent, the Bantams fanzine, who was also at the ground when the fire took hold, said fans accepted the findings of judge Oliver Popplewell\u2019s inquiry. \u201cNo Bradford City fan wanted to blame the club at the time. We all felt it was handled respectfully \u2026 there was nobody clamouring to apportion blame.\u201d He cautioned against equating the apparent acquiescence of fans with an unwillingness to face the truth. Until now, City Gent had never written about the fire, he said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s one of those things people don\u2019t want to talk or write about\u201d. He added: \u201cThey see what\u2019s happened with Hillsborough. We have been quite stoical about it. We don\u2019t outwardly show our pain. We just got on with our lives. Probably it\u2019s a particularly Bradford thing. But the Scousers had an injustice to fight. We haven\u2019t, until now, with Martin Fletcher\u2019s book.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
