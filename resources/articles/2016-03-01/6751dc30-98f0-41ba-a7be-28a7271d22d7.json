Borthwick, who was Japan\u2019s forwards coach under Eddie Jones, admits to being an obsessive, but in the modern game analysis is everything and there is no time for quaffing champagne when players need to be fully briefed. \u201cThe players have now got apps for everything\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I was a player at Bath we had a VHS player in the clubhouse at The Rec and if you were going through a game you\u2019d have to get up and press pause manually all the time; the machine did not have a remote control. \u201cNow players have apps where everything is on their computers. They are used to instant analysis of us or the opposition and we all watch the footage. After the Ireland game, I went through the game making notes of things I wanted to see, then looked at those specific elements and went through it again having done the detailed analysis. It is what players are used to.\u201d On Saturday England face Wales, their biggest match since Jones took over in November. Victory would give them a tilt at the grand slam on the final day in Paris. Having tweaked their tactics against Ireland, not least in the way they defended lineouts, they will tailor their game for their main rivals for the title. \u201cEddie is really good at making the gameplan specific to the opposition,\u201d says Borthwick. \u201cThe bulk of it is about what we do and how we improve and a bit is the tweak towards the opposition, which Eddie does. We have made progress in the first three games but we still have work to do and are far from where we need to be. \u201cA big element is that our set piece has to be in sync with the rest of our play and something Eddie does incredibly well is develop a game model with nothing in isolation. We said from day one we would hook the ball at the scrum because we want the ball at the No8\u2019s feet as quickly as possible to give him options. We are making progress in the lineout but there is still quite a bit of work to be done there.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
