With his white button-down shirt rolled up at the sleeves, the president stopped to look inside one of the cells, marked 123, which despite measuring just 9-by-10ft, has on occasion housed three inmates. Although a ray of sunlight shone down on the corridor from a row of ceiling windows, inside the cell the only source of light was a barred window not much larger than a picture frame. It looked out on the prison\u2019s sprawling outer grounds \u2013 enclosed by tall, barbed-wire fences. The inmates had been temporarily moved so Obama, the first sitting US president to visit a federal prison, could get a glimpse of life inside the medium-security, all-male facility in central Oklahoma. The cells were nearly identical: twin-sized mattresses on two single bunks, a shared bedside table that typically contained a handful of books, two blue plastic chairs stacked next to narrow, white steel cabinets, a toilet with no seat and a sink with a small mirror and an even smaller shelf. Obama had just spent 45 minutes in a roundtable setting with six of the inmates who inhabit such cells \u2013 all nonviolent drug offenders. His administration is pushing a sweeping overhaul of the nation\u2019s criminal justice system. The visit, he told reporters following his tour, would hopefully \u201chighlight both the challenges and opportunities that we face\u201d in ensuring that the system is not only fair, but also both preventative and effective. Obama toured the facility with Charles Samuels, director of the Bureau of Prisons, and correctional officer Ronald Warlick. While he praised the prison as \u201can outstanding institution within the system, Obama added there were \u201cenormous overcrowding issues\u201d, referencing the cell he had glanced inside. \u201cThree, whole-grown men in a 9ft by 10ft cell \u2013 there\u2019s been some improvement, now we have two, but overcrowding like that is something that has to be addressed,\u201d Obama said. Hailing El Reno \u2013 which has roughly 1,300 inmates \u2013 for its emphasis on education, job training and drug counselling, Obama underscored the need to grant nonviolent offenders a second chance. Reflecting on his meeting with the inmates \u2013 some of them serving \u201cvery long sentences\u201d \u2013 Obama said he was struck by how their lives might have been different had they been born with the structural and societal support the average citizen takes for granted. \u201cWhen they described their youth and their childhood, these are young people who made mistakes that aren\u2019t that different than the mistakes I made and the mistakes a lot of you guys made,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThe difference is they did not have the kind of support structures, the second chances, the resources that would allow them to survive those mistakes.\u201d \u201cSo many young people end up in our criminal justice system \u2013 it\u2019s not normal. It\u2019s not what happens in other countries. What is normal is teenagers doing stupid things, what is normal is young people making mistakes, and we\u2019ve got to be able to distinguish between dangerous individuals who need to be incapacitated and incarcerated versus young people who are in an environment in which they are adapting, but given different opportunities and a different vision of life could be thriving the way we are. \u201cThat\u2019s what strikes me,\u201d he concluded, somberly. \u201cThere but for the grace of God.\u201d Above Obama as he spoke, a slim wall separating the two floors was adorned with bold words painted in green and yellow. They began grimly \u2013 with \u201cdiscontinuity\u201d and \u201cindolence\u201d \u2013 but concluded in a more hopeful vein, with \u201coptimism\u201d and \u201cintegrity\u201d. \u2018Our kids, America\u2019s children, so often are isolated, without hope \u2026\u2019 That transition \u2013 from a life marked by discontinuity to one of a more optimistic future \u2013 is at the heart of Obama\u2019s pitch on criminal justice, as momentum grows for both prison and drug sentencing reform across the political spectrum. The president spent much of the week spotlighting the disproportionate policing, prosecution and detention of minorities \u2013 beginning with an announcement on Monday that he was commuting the sentences of 46 federal prisoners who had been jailed for nonviolent drug offenses. The move brought Obama\u2019s total number of commutations to 89, the most in a single day since President Lyndon B Johnson. The issue of criminal justice in America has gained a new sense of urgency over the last year, particularly amid a series of high-profile killings of unarmed black men at the hands of police \u2013 bringing the nation to a crossroads with shadows of the 1960s civil rights movement. Obama laid out a comprehensive approach to reforming a system that is stacked against black and Hispanic communities in particular \u2013 most of which would require Congress to take action \u2013 during an impassioned speech on Tuesday before the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the oldest and largest civil rights organization in the US. Addressing the group in Philadelphia, the president spoke bluntly of a deep-rooted discrimination against minorities that he said ranged from the justice system to everyday life, dubbing it \u201ca crisis\u201d that can no longer be ignored. \u201cThe bottom line is that in too many places, black boys and black men, Latino boys and Latino men experience being treated differently under the law,\u201d Obama said, citing statistics showing that 60% of the nation\u2019s inmates are black and Hispanic even though both demographics combined make up just 30% of the population. \u201cBy just about every measure, the life chances for black and Hispanic youth still lag far behind those of their white peers,\u201d he said. \u201cOur kids, America\u2019s children, so often are isolated, without hope, less likely to graduate from high school, less likely to earn a college degree, less likely to be employed, less likely to have health insurance, less likely to own a home.\u201d The president called for lowering \u2013 if not ending \u2013 mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenses, restoring the voting rights of ex-felons, revisiting hiring practices that require applicants to list criminal activity, and expanding job training programs so inmates are better prepared to reintegrate into society. Easing mandatory minimums has gained particular steam on Capitol Hill, bringing together the unlikeliest of bedfellows \u2013 from Tea Party conservatives to liberal firebrands \u2013 and leaving the Obama administration optimistic that at least some legislative victories are within reach. Obama\u2019s aggressive efforts to fix the criminal justice system are also the latest reflection that he wishes to give a new meaning to being lame-duck president, viewing his final two years in office not as with little choice but to watch from the sidelines \u2013 but instead to cement his legacy with the culmination of the \u201chope and change\u201d he famously campaigned on in 2008. \u201cThere\u2019s a certain freedom with where the president is. He knows he\u2019s never going to have to be on a ballot again,\u201d Michele Jawando, the vice-president for legal process at the Center for American Progress, told the Guardian. \u201cWhen you think about where do you want to have significant impact both culturally and symbolically \u2026 the system that he is in charge of has perpetrated years of systematic bias and discrimination on the poor and people of color, and he recognizes he has an opportunity, however fleeting, to capture this moment and move forward.\u201d For much of the first six years of his presidency, Obama waded more cautiously into racial politics. He often found himself acknowledging an issue that resonated with him personally, while grappling with the soaring expectations of being the nation\u2019s first black president. \u201cI think that has been a very real part of the presidency,\u201d Jawando said. \u201cHe has had to consistently deal with challenges \u2013 on one side unique obstacles because he was the first African American president, and on the other challenges that only he would have to ever embrace or speak to because he was the first African American president.\u201d But the death of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed Florida teenager who was shot and killed in 2012 by a neighborhood watchman, George Zimmerman, marked a turning point. As the details unfolded \u2013 Zimmerman trailed Martin, suspicious of the black teen sporting a hoodie, provoking an altercation that left the 17-year-old dead \u2013 public outcry spread across the nation. The Obama administration maintained the caution it routinely applies to ongoing criminal investigations. That was until the president was asked about the incident directly, prompting a response that within a few short words spoke volumes. \u201cIf I had a son, he\u2019d look like Trayvon,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWhen I think about this boy, I think about my own kids.\u201d He expanded upon those comments in summer 2013, after a jury acquitted Zimmerman of murder charges, sparking nationwide protests. After a week of silence, Obama emerged in the White House briefing room to offer the most extensive remarks on race of his presidency to date. He reflected personally on what it was like to be a black man in America \u2013 from the woman who clutched her purse in your presence to the sound of people locking their car doors as you walked by. The speech marked a rare opening into the thinking of a president who shared the frustration felt by communities of color across America \u2013 because he had lived it. And as he alluded to in his visit to the prison on Thusrday, Obama empathized with the inmates he met \u2013 because he could have been them. In his second term, Obama began a piecemeal approach to boosting minority youth \u2013 launching My Brother\u2019s Keeper in February 2014 as a signature initiative designed to help at-risk black youths and invest in their educational opportunity and potential. Under the program, the White House teamed up with both nonprofits and private companies to address gaps in education, employment and criminal justice. In contrast, however, to his repeated advocacy for other items on his agenda \u2013 such as immigration reform, climate change and LGBT rights \u2013 some civil rights advocates have argued that Obama\u2019s focus on criminal justice reform is long overdue. Texas representative Sheila Jackson Lee, a Democrat and member of the Congressional Black Caucus, said it was not for a lack of wanting on Obama\u2019s part to be engaged. The president, she said, has simply had to contend with a series of crises \u2013 ranging from those manufactured by Congress to the threat of terrorism abroad \u2013 and channeled many of his criminal justice proposals through the former attorney general Eric Holder. \u201cLeading a nation is very difficult. You can have an agenda that gets distracted for the reason that you have to respond to crises in this country and on the world stage,\u201d Jackson Lee said, pointing to Obama\u2019s signing of the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act, which reduced the penalties for crack cocaine offenses, as evidence that criminal justice has been an important piece of the president\u2019s agenda since his early days in office. But the systemic barriers against minorities were thrust into the spotlight again last summer, forcing the issue of criminal justice back to the forefront of Obama\u2019s agenda. Two unarmed black men \u2013 Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in New York City \u2013 died at the hands of police. Protesters of all stripes took the streets across major US cities and in Ferguson, images and videos of a militarized police force clashing with demonstrators were broadcast throughout the world. The moment captured not only the outrage over the killings, but long-simmering tensions between law enforcement and the racial minorities they disproportionately target. Even then, Obama navigated the unrest with his signature pragmatism. He condemned the small faction of protesters who engaged in looting and arson and called for peaceful demonstrations, while acknowledging the factors that created mistrust between police officers and communities of color. The president also requested $263m in funding for body cameras for police and better training \u2013 policies that have begun to gain traction at the state level, but where local law enforcement say they lack sufficient resources. The subsequent national attention on inherent racial bias \u2013 aided by increased awareness, with many incidents being caught on camera \u2013 in many ways opened the pathway for Obama to litigate his case on criminal justice before the court of public opinion. The climate has, at the very least, ensured that US lawmakers can no longer turn a blind eye to the correlation between an inequitable justice system and the deterioration of race relations. And it has enabled an ever-emboldened Obama to maintain pressure on Congress to send legislation to his desk that addresses not just the consequences of an unjust system, but also its causes. That encompasses investments in early education \u2013 the president has pushed for universal pre-kindergarten \u2013 an end to mass incarceration and a chance at redemption. Alternatives to prison, such as drug courts and treatment and probation programs, should also be considered, Obama said. \u2018An injustice system\u2019 The number of people behind bars in America has quadrupled since 1980, he told reporters following his tour of the prison on Thursday. American taxpayers, Obama added, are left to pick up the tab of roughly $80bn a year. \u201cA primary driver of this mass incarceration phenomenon is our drug laws \u2013 our mandatory minimum sentencing around drug laws,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd we have to consider whether this is the smartest way for us to both control crime and rehabilitate individuals.\u201d The president also reiterated his hope that Republicans who have expressed interest in criminal justice will come through. A bill to lower some mandatory minimums, as well as legislation that would allow lower-risk prisoners to enroll in recidivism-reduction programs and earn an earlier release, have Democratic and Republican co-sponsors in the Senate. Jackson Lee said she was preparing to introduce bills in the House of Representatives to establish a rehabilitation process for juveniles behind bars and protect them from practices like solitary confinement, among other legislation designed to improve police-community relationships. John Boehner, the Republican House speaker, also surprised many by endorsing a bill to reduce mandatory minimums on Thursday \u2013 a major boost to criminal justice advocates. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of people in prison, frankly, that don\u2019t really in my view need to be there,\u201d Boehner told reporters on Capitol Hill. \u201cIt\u2019s expensive to house. Some of these people are in there for what I\u2019ll call flimsy reasons.\u201d The issue has also entered the 2016 presidential contest, with Republican candidate Rand Paul often speaking on the campaign trail about the need to restore voting rights for nonviolent ex-felons and criticizing the disproportionate number of minorities in US prisons. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner, has routinely broached the subject. She dedicated the first major speech of her campaign to criminal justice after riots erupted in Baltimore in May over another police killing of an unarmed black man. Her husband, former President Bill Clinton, has acknowledged the so-called \u201ctough on crime\u201d laws he signed in the 1990s caused the prison population in America to skyrocket and made mass incarceration worse. While it early yet to say if the wide-ranging support will translate into the transformation Obama seeks, the president has laid down his marker \u2013 issuing a moral call to action in his remarks before the NAACP. \u201cAny system that allows us to turn a blind eye to hopelessness and despair, that\u2019s not a justice system, it is an injustice system,\u201d he said. \u201cJustice is giving every child a shot at a great education no matter what zip code they\u2019re born into. Justice is giving everyone willing to work hard the chance at a good job with good wages, no matter what their name is, what their skin color is, where they live.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
