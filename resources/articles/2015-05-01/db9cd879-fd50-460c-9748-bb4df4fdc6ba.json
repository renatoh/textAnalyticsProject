The three-part series will include harrowing interviews with victims of former Radio Caroline DJ, Ray Teret, who was sentenced last year for the rape and indecent assault of girls in Manchester in the 1960s and 1970s. Detectives in the case told of the \u201cthrill\u201d when wallpaper in his former flat was peeled away to reveal the names of girls graffitied on the wall, corroborating victims\u2019 evidence given to police half a century later. It also includes footage of the first police interview given by Cathy Hymas, one of the first women to come forward, who was 12 when she first met Teret. Hymas told police she found herself getting \u201cchurned up\u201d whenever she saw Savile on television because \u201cthe mannerisms and stuff reminds me of Teret\u201d. \u201cI took my friend to see this man, he had me doing sex while she was there like, you know, this is what you do. When he\u2019d finished I just went home, I just felt so embarrassed,\u201d said Hymas, breaking down in tears. \u201cI thought Teret was my friend, I trusted him as a friend.\u201d The series, called The Detectives, was filmed over two years at a specialist unit to investigate sex offences set up by Greater Manchester police three years ago. It includes a number of cases including Paul Fenner, a Wigan man who was jailed in 2013 for raping a 13-year-old girl on her way to school, and briefly features former TV weatherman Fred Talbot, who was jailed earlier this year for five years for indecently assaulting two schoolboys when he was a teacher. Teret initially denied the allegations, telling detectives in an early interview: \u201cI\u2019ve got my mouth open, nothing has ever happened like that. I have never had sex with underage girls.\u201d The series director, James Newton, said: \u201cI think he was playing games with us when we first filmed him in custody. He wants to have control. We did talk to him a little bit. He was an odd man, a really odd man.\u201d Executive producer Colin Barr, talking at the programme launch on Monday, said: \u201cIt is really difficult to get programmes on a subject like this on to television. It is dark and grim and all of those things. I hope by having a series like this, it has the narrative twists \u2026 that people will want to come back and see what happens next.\u201d Det Sgt Carol Barlow, one of the officers in charge of the Teret investigation, said: \u201cThis isn\u2019t a drama, it\u2019s real life. I can\u2019t tell you the thrill the incident team had when \u2018oh my god, we have got the evidence [on Teret], we have got something that corroborates that those girls were in that flat\u2019. It was a very uplifting moment.\u201d She said historical offences against celebrities were \u201cpretty much the flavour of the moment and there are two categories [of responses]. There are those that think it\u2019s a great thing but sadly there are those whose opinion is well, it was all so long ago, why haven\u2019t they moved on, what\u2019s their motive, are they lying?\u201d Barlow added: \u201cFrom speaking to some of the victims \u2026 the hurt it has caused them is terrible and I really hope this programme might promote some thought into the long term effect that an event like that has on a child and how it forms their adulthood.\u201d The series will be shown on BBC2 on three consecutive nights, beginning this Sunday. Det Supt Jon Chadwick, who set up the new Manchester unit, said he hoped the series would encourage more women who had been attacked to come to the police. In the past three years, the number of rapes reported to the Greater Manchester force has increased by 130%. \u201cPolicing gets a lot of bad press, it would be very easy to misquote us out of context,\u201d said Chadwick. \u201cCops are human beings under pressure, they say the wrong thing now and again, including myself.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
