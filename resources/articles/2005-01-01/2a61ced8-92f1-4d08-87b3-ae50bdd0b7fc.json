So thank goodness, then, that Exeter applied a dose of Grecian 2005 (\u00a9 Fiver contrived gags dept) to this year's competition by holding Manchester United's C team to a 0-0 draw at Old Trafford - a result which not only staved off financial obliteration, but sparked delirium in the town. How else to explain Exeter's Odeon cinema selling out 700 seats to watch the replay - no doubt at a healthy premium - when it will be shown, free of charge, in every home in the land on BBC1? Still, you can't blame all Exeter for being giddy: after all, it's not every day Sir Alex Ferguson promises to play his big-name stars, including the fit-again Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs, in a domestic cup competition, is it? The replay should also swell the Grecians' coffers by at least \u00a3800,000 - not bad seeing as they're currently losing \u00a320,000 a month (and were \u00a34.5m in debt just two years ago). But even though St James's Park is built on a pig farm (when the club took over in 1904, it signed a lease stipulating \"no menageries, shows, circuses or steam roundabouts\"), United - Wayne Rooney's flabby thighs apart - surely won't get stuck in the mire again. Which is more than can be said for Liverpool, who chanced the likes of Zak Whitbread, John Welsh, Darren Potter and David Raven against Burnley at Turf Moor last night and paid the Djimi Traore OG. Despite shamelessly flaunting FA Cup rules - which [Fiver dons anorak] include a toothless clause banning teams from fielding weakened line-ups - Rafa Benitez's side won't be punished. Which surely gives Arsenal and Manchester United carte blanche to do the same during their fourth-round games, which take place just three days ahead of their Premiership clash on February 1? Still, good news for Jens Lehmann, eh? Follow Exeter v Manchester United with Barry Glendenning from 7.30pm: here * * * * * * * * * * * * SEEN THIS?

Neil Sullivan. * * * * * * * * * * * * PRIDE COMES BEFORE A WINNER'S MEDAL The Fiver didn't initially warm to Jose Mourinho. Smug, self-satisfied, and so painfully, exquisitely good-looking - he reminded us so much of ourselves that it was all we could do to stumble crestfallen to the nearest mirror for a cathartic ogle. But he soon turned us round. Humility may be the pretence of choice among football managers in England, but is it really so wrong that Mourinho - who today said that the Premiership is all but Chelsea's - does his best Catchphrase-contestant impersonation? Say what you see, Jose! \"There is so much ground for the teams chasing us to make up,\" Mourinho said today, while idly trampling a couple of squabbling ants on his coat-tail. \"Could you ever imagine that with all the new players and a new coach we could be 10 [points] clear at this stage?\" he added, massaging his pesky \u00a370m Achilles' heel. \"In this league, we cannot sleep. If one day the gap goes from 10 to seven or eight, we are ready to accept it as natural and keep going, controlling the distance.\" It's true that pride usually comes before a fall, but then a 10-point lead usually comes before a championship. Let's be honest, it makes a pleasant change from 'taking each game as it comes': Mourinho's attitude is as refreshing as a jammed F5 button. \"If it goes from 10 to 12 or 13 points then maybe it will be over,\" he concluded. And it's not like Jose's got much wrong so far. \u00a35m for Mateja Kezman you say? Well, everyone's allowed one mistake. * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Arsenal are being linked with a potential goalkeeping swap, involving Jens Lehmann and Stuttgart's Timo Hildebrand, whose contract talks in Germany have just collapsed. Steve McClaren is giving Roma's Olivier Dacourt the glad eye. Spurs are apparently considering an exchange deal in an attempt to prise Wayne Routledge from Iain Dowie's clutches. * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Lomana LuaLua has been charged with improper conduct for the fit he threw after being harshly sent off for sticking the heed on Blackburn's Andy Todd on Saturday. West Brom boss Bryan Robson has spotted the words 'World Cup-winner' next to Bernard Diomede's name and taken him on trial. Uefa have named their team of 2004, with Ashley Cole, Cristiano Ronaldo and Thierry Henry all featuring as well as Fingers Mourinho as coach. The team in full: Buffon, Cafu, Carvalho, Nesta, Cole, Ronaldo, Maniche, Ronaldinho, Nedved, Henry, Shevchenko. * * * * * * * * * * * FIVER LETTERS!/FA CUP BILE SPLATTERING! \"It's all down to money. The FA Cup doesn't bring in the cash that a Big Cup run would bring - never mind the feelings of the people who pay the wages. Of course the same squad can't be expected to play in every match; after all, don't they have to train for up to two hours a day? Time that the training was rotated too? Or time for me to point out to my employer that I can't be expected to work every single day?\" - Roy Anderson. \"Re: Burnley beating Liverpool. How nice to see that 'industry' and 'teamwork' can be recognised to be the equals of talent and good fortune - we value the former pair too little nowadays and the latter pair far too highly\" - Patricia. \"Today I somehow found my way to what claims to be Boudewijn Zenden's official website.
