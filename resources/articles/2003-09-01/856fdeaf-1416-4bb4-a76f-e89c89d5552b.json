The keenly-awaited show, scripted by Drop the Dead Donkey writer Andy Hamilton, tells the story of a successful but neurotic sports agent played by Neil Pearson, and has featured appearances from This Life's Andrew Lincoln and ex-EastEnder Jo Absolom. Its first episode was watched by 3.2 million people in the difficult 9.30pm slot. But ratings slipped to 2.8 million in its second week and its third episode last Friday showed no sign of improvement, with 600,000 viewers fewer than Griff Rhys Jones' Restoration on BBC2. The remaining three episodes will be broadcast at 10.35pm on Mondays, beginning on 15 September. The sitcom was part of BBC1's much-trumpeted comedy \"triple bill\" on Friday nights, along with long-running Ardal O'Hanlon sitcom My Hero and another new series, Paul O'Grady vehicle Eyes Down, set in a bingo hall. Eyes Down has fared little better in the ratings but has survived the chop. From tonight it is shifted half an hour later into the old Trevor's World of Sport slot to make way for a ratings banker, an Only Fools and Horses repeat. Trevor's World of Sport had a mixed reaction from the critics. Charlie Catchpole in the Star said it was \"shaping up as one of the best home-grown sitcoms in years,\" while The Sun's Ally Ross said it was \"brilliantly acted, beautifully written and captures the essential hatefulness of sports PRs perfectly\". Others were not so kind. David Stephenson in the Express said the show, along with Eyes Down, was \"about as funny as a trip to the pensions consultant - and just as depressing\". James Corrigan in the Independent said it was lame and made him \"envy the New York powercut\". But it's not the first BBC1 sitcom to struggle in the Friday night ratings battle. Harry Enfield's Celeb was mauled by the critics last autumn and ended up with only 3.5 million viewers in a similar slot last year. In his review of the first episode of Trevor's World of Sport, the Guardian's Rupert Smith had warned the show, along with Eyes Down, \"could gather enough momentum to start flying, but on the evidence of the first episodes these are shows that may get burned in the scorching spotlight of prime-time Friday TV\". A BBC spokeswoman said: \"The show has not really found its audience on a Friday night. Hopefully it will be able to do that in the new slot on Monday.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
