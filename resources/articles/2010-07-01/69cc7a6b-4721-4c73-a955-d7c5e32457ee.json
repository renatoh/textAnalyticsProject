Michael Johnson will run on the track at the main stadium, Sir Chris Hoy will pedal away in the velodrome, a volunteering scheme will be launched, and the first Olympic shop is due to open. On Tuesday we pass the \"two years to go\" mark. When we are nearer to the next Games than the last, the media and the public take notice. Two questions are asked more often than any others. They are: \"How do I get tickets?\"and \"How much will they cost?\" The answers are not clear yet, though there is a guide on page 12 of this section. When prices are announced in about three months' time, the headlines will, inevitably, be about the most expensive tickets. When good news happens, such as the delivery programme coming in \u00a351m under budget, it is buried away, as happened last week. When tickets are priced at \u00a3200 for the 100 metres final (a guess, not a fact) there will be outrage. Is this fair? Perhaps not, judging by recent prices. The Champions League final in May was the first club football match to have an average ticket price higher than \u00a3100. The World Cup final was even more expensive. A good County Stand seat for the Grand National was \u00a380; a Wimbledon Centre Court ticket for the men's final \u00a3104 (if you were lucky enough in the public ballot); a covered grandstand ticket for Silverstone, covering qualifying and the British grand prix, \u00a3270; a season ticket for the week at the Open at St Andrews, \u00a3240. A day at Lord's for next month's Test against Pakistan is \u00a380, and a Ryder Cup four\u2011day ticket is \u00a3370. Tickets for top sports events are ever more expensive. Yes, \u00a3100-plus is steep, and there will be plenty of sessions priced at that level in 2012. But there will be many thousands of cheaper tickets, too. Preliminary rounds in the handball, wrestling and taekwondo might not hold much attraction this far out, but being there at all will be an experience and they will sell out. Big sport in Britain (and on tour, for that matter) always sells out. What should you do? Last year, a survey by a British travel company revealed that the average spend for a family holiday was just over \u00a32,000, down by more than 12% on the 2008 figures. The recession was to blame, and the most popular way of saving on holiday expenditure was staying in the UK rather than travelling abroad. The next most effective cost-cutter was spending less on the holiday wardrobe. All of which is good news for London 2012, and for anybody thinking about tickets. Don't worry about the beachwear, forget the Far East and head down to the East End instead. Make a holiday of the Olympics. You can start saving now..."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
