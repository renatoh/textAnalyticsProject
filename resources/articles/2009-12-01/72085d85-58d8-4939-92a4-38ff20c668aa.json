In a few weeks you might just have changed your tune", "bodyText": "It has stormed the US television ratings, been hailed as the best new show of the year and spawned two hit albums. Now the musical comedy Glee \u2013 an upbeat but spiky drama about a school's struggling singing club \u2013 arrives next month to liven up UK screens in a whirl of jazz hands and power ballads. Watched by more than 8 million fans \u2013 who call themselves \"gleeks\" \u2013 during its first-season run in the US this autumn, the show follows the attempts of an idealistic Ohio teacher to mould a bunch of high-school misfits into an award-winning \"show choir\". Its feelgood mix of optimism, powerhouse vocals and dark humour immediately won over the critics when it debuted in May. Entertainment Weekly described it as \"so good \u2013 so funny, so bulging with vibrant characters \u2013 that it blasts past any defences you might put up. Glee will not stop until it wins you over utterly\". It has been nominated for four Golden Globe awards, including best TV series. But the show, created by Nip/Tuck writer, Ryan Murphy, has caused just as much of a stir through its impact on the album and single charts. Glee has proved that there is a new way to make TV shows profitable and sell music. Each episode features half a dozen songs, ranging in style from classic show tunes to current chart hits. Two tracks have been released digitally each week during the series, to huge success \u2013 so far the cast have notched up 3m sales with songs such as their version of Beyonc\u00e9's Single Ladies. The biggest hit to date, with over half a million downloads, has been the cast's recording of Don't Stop Believin', a 1981 soft-rock anthem by Journey. The music industry has not been slow to take notice \u2013 the X Factor winner, Joe McElderry, performed the song twice during the finals of the British talent show this month. Glee's cast have already released two albums, covering artists from Amy Winehouse, Kanye West and Rihanna to John Lennon and Neil Diamond, as well as tunes from shows including Wicked and Cabaret. The first soundtrack volume went straight into the Billboard charts at No 4 last month and the second entered at No 3 earlier this month. The albums, which now have nearly a million combined sales, were released by Columbia, a subsidiary of Sony, to which Simon Cowell's label SyCo is also affiliated. A cast tour is planned for summer amid claims by its stars that the show has inspired a boom in school singing clubs. Matthew Morrison, who plays the teacher, has announced a solo disc that he hopes will be \"a classier Justin Timberlake album\". Part of the show's success stems from the way it has struck a chord across the generations. The young audiences of High School Musical (which Murphy claims never to have seen) and American Idol appear to have responded to the aspiration voiced by the ambitious teen Rachel: \"Nowadays being anonymous is worse than being poor. Fame is the most important thing. But no one is just going to hand it to you.\" Meanwhile, older viewers have recalled the 1980s series Fame (and perhaps Murphy's shortlived but witty cheerleader comedy Popular, which ran 10 years ago) while enjoying the viciously pointed humour. In particular, the reviewers have raved about the casting of the sadistic sports teacher, played by Jane Lynch, who regales her charges with lines such as: \"You think this is hard? Try being waterboarded \u2013 that's hard.\" It remains to be seen whether UK audiences will respond in the same way to the show's blend of innocence and mischief when it begins its run on E4 on 11 January. But viewers in the US seem in no doubt that it is a class act.
