About 100 people had gathered round an act that involved a man dragging people out from the crowd and persuading them to look daft while he performed a few tricks. It turned out that the noise was coming from a balcony belonging to the Punch and Judy bar and overlooking the piazza. About 20 men in their 30s and 40s had lined up with their drinks and were hurling racist abuse at the performer, who was Afro-Caribbean and wearing a beret in Rastafarian colours. The crowd around the performer clearly felt for him, but did not seem to know what to do. They stayed watching in silence and when the act was over stepped forward to give him money and their sympathy. That was encouraging, but it did little to expunge what had been one of the most ugly displays of racism that I've ever seen in Britain. This has very little to do with the usual subject of my posts here, except perhaps in one respect. We assume that our society is a known and basically unvarying quantity. There have always been racists in Britain. The anarchic London mob of the eighteenth century is not far beneath the surface in a modern crowd of men with beer in their stomachs. But as I walked away to my meeting, I wondered how things would be if in the gathering storm of the economic crisis our less than robust democracy suddenly became prey to racist extremism. Certainly on a local level, it's not beyond the bounds of possibility, and we have only to think of the powers Labour has given to local councils, police and other agencies to realise what a disaster this would be. This may still seem very unlikely but I am sure that few have really grasped how this economic crisis could destabilise apparently secure free societies. We assume that our society is rock solid, yet for the last dozen years we have allowed our democratic traditions and institutions to be attacked by a small number of determined politicians, backed up or led by \u2013 I am never sure which \u2013 a group of ruthlessly controlling servants in the Home Office and Justice departments. They have built a state apparatus of surveillance that no dictatorship in the history of the world has ever possessed. Where does that leave us? How vulnerable are we in the future to an extremist government \u2013 right or left \u2013 that comes to power during circumstances that we never imagined? Anyway, that grim thought is the preface the collection of a few links from my researcher Hannah Lease. The first, appropriately, refers to the outrage felt by German MPs at the arrest of Damian Green. In a public statement, they say: \"Britain's democracy and Parliament is admired across the world. We are astonished that an opposition member can be arrested in this way, and that the British police can enter the British Parliament to search an MP's office without a warrant. In Germany such a procedure would be unacceptable. As members of Parliament in a fellow democracy, we express our strong support for Mr Green in this ordeal and his right to do the job he was elected to do.\" And here is Nature's editorial on the DNA decision by the European Court of Human Rights, which concludes: \"The idea that the identity of a human can be revealed from samples of any cell in his or her body is a symbol of the fact that every person is unique. The declaration of human rights asks us to treasure and honour all these unique individuals with respect for their autonomy \u2013 not to simply look for better ways to barcode them.\" This thought has never occurred to New Labour's authoritarian leaders, but it has to the Socialist party website, which carries an article by a law lecturer from the University of Kent, David Radlett. \"Clause 18 of the counter-terrorism bill 2008,\" he begins, \"will allow DNA and fingerprints to be gathered and held by a vast range of public bodies ranging from the security services to local councils. Such material will be available for 'national security' purposes, investigating and prosecuting crime, or for identification.\" This extraordinary measure has largely gone unreported, a common feature in the slide of our democracy. Here is a speech made in the Lords by the retired head of MI5, Baroness Manningham Buller, who with her opposition to 42 days \u2013 and now this speech about the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act \u2013 is turning out to be a true democrat. This is how she laid into the powers granted by the government to local authorities and hundreds of agencies to snoop on our private affairs: \"The legislation was drafted at the urgent request of the intelligence and security community so that its techniques would be compatible with the Human Rights Act when it came into force in 2000. I can remember being astonished to read that organisations such as the Milk Marketing Board, and whatever the equivalent is for eggs, would have access to some of the techniques. On the principle governing the use of intrusive techniques, which invade people's privacy, there should be clarity in the law as to what is permitted and they should be used only in cases where the threat justified them and their use was proportionate.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
