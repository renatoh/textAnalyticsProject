Mr Jackson has already pleaded not guilty to child molestation charges made last year, involving a different alleged victim, in Santa Barbara county, California. The new Los Angeles police department investigation was announced by a spokeswoman late yesterday. Mary Grady, commander of the department's public information office, said the Los Angeles county district attorney's office had asked the LAPD to investigate the new allegation a month ago. She declined to elaborate on details such as the age or sex of the alleged victim but said: \"The victim alleges the acts took place in the city of Los Angeles in the late 1980s.\" The allegations are being investigated by the child protection section of the LAPD's juvenile division. Mr Jackson's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, yesterday said that he was unaware of the new investigation. \"Since I have been involved in this case, I have addressed literally dozens of completely baseless rumours on a daily basis, and this appears to be just another one of them,\" Mr Brafman said. Steve Cron, a defence lawyer who has represented clients accused of molestation, said that the new alleged abuse would be within the statute of limitations if it occurred after 1988. Santa Barbara county prosecutors were last night unavailable for comment. Late last year, Mr Jackson was charged by the Santa Barbara district attorney with committing lewd or lascivious acts upon a child and administering an intoxicating agent to the child. Mr Jackson pleaded not guilty, and a pre-trial hearing is scheduled for April 30. The singer reportedly reached a multi-million dollar settlement with a boy who accused him of molestation in 1993. No criminal charges were brought in that case."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
