Hodgson, whose appearance did not go entirely to plan \u2013 an unlikely caption error briefly billing him as the \"Premier League's all-time top goalscorer\" \u2013 admitted he felt the weight of expectation before the decisive World Cup qualifiers against Montenegro and Poland at Wembley, but was confident England would progress. \"I've had some weeks in the past with other national teams leading up to final qualification games where you feel a lot of responsibility for the country and for trying to get your team through. But when it's your own country it weighs that little bit more heavily.\" Hodgson said England would improve from their last, much-criticised performance \u2013 a goalless draw against Ukraine. \"In hindsight, we've had better attacking days, though our defending was very good, our shape was very good and in the circumstances to take a point from a difficult game was not bad. But when we have what I think is our best team on the field we have some marvellous attacking players and pass the ball very well. \"I know 80% of my team for Friday. There are always positions where I still have to make decisions, but I have a pretty good idea, and I am confident.\" Hodgson also reiterated his faith in Joe Hart, who made another error in Manchester City's defeat of Everton, and confirmed the goalkeeper will play in both Wembley games. \"Goalkeepers are in a very difficult position\u2013 every mistake is so easy to see. Midfielders can make mistakes, forwards can make silly runs, we don't always notice. But with a goalkeeper everyone sees it. But this is a time for experience and for people who really know what its like to play for England in important games.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
