Obama, who will dine with Xi on Thursday night, is expected to address hacking concerns, notably the disastrous breach of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which exposed the personal information (including psychiatric evaluations and background checks) of some 21.5 million current, former and prospective federal workers. In answer to a question about Chinese hacking at Thursday\u2019s White House press briefing, the presidential press secretary, Josh Earnest, said Obama was prepared to respond to large-scale cybercrime with economic punishment. \u201cI will just say that we have made clear our concerns about China\u2019s activity in cyberspace,\u201d Earnest said. \u201cThere are a range of tools that are at the president\u2019s disposal to respond to those concerns. We do believe that having those tools on the table, including possible financial sanctions, have been effective as a deterrent and in advancing our interest in that regard.\u201d Chinese hacking and corporate espionage, both the apparently state-sponsored variety and individual, has made for an awkward series of meetings with Xi in Silicon Valley. Tim Cook, Satya Nadella, Jeff Bezos and other leaders of the American tech sector have met Xi, but it is unclear what effects the meetings will have. Microsoft\u2019s Nadella played host to Xi on the tech company\u2019s campus yesterday, where Xi posed for a photo op with that company\u2019s CEO, Cook, Bezos, Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Alibaba\u2019s Jack Ma and a host of others. Notably absent from the picture is Sundar Pichai, newly appointed CEO of Google, which is blocked in China over its refusal to censor search. Nadella eschewed controversy in a statement to the Guardian. \u201cIt was an honor to host President Xi Jinping and first lady Peng Liyuan at Microsoft, and to have the opportunity to discuss our vision for how technology can help advance health, education and business around the world,\u201d he wrote. Dean Garfield, president and CEO of tech business lobbying group and thinktank the Information Technology Industry Council, opened his address to the US-China Internet Industry Forum (where Xi was in attendance) in Silicon Valley on Wednesday thus: \u201cWe live in a world where the list of societal challenges is long, and getting longer, but where the collective collaboration between the United States and China is just, say, suboptimal.\u201d Earnest said further that talk from Chinese officials on this subject was cheap. \u201cI think we will pay particular attention to China\u2019s behavior and their conduct,\u201d he told the press corps. \u201cTheir actions are more important than their words.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
