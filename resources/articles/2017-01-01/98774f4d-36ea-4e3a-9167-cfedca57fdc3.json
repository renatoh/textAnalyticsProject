Alan Langdon, and his daughter, Que, spend 27 days sailing across the Tasman Sea in a 21-foot catamaran with one broken rudder, arriving in the coastal port about midday on Wednesday. Que\u2019s mother, Ariane Wyler Langdon, lives in Switzerland and is estranged from Langdon. In April last year, she contracted a child recovery specialist to help find Langdon, and Que, so she could serve him court papers. Wyler Langdon, who has reportedly not seen her daughter for 21 months, has been informed of the pair\u2019s safe arrival in Australia. In Ulladulla harbour on Wednesday, Langdon spoke with reporters as he tidied the boat and packed up from the voyage. Fairfax Media reported the 46-year-old played down concerns over the potential dangers of the voyage, despite one of the catamaran\u2019s rudders breaking four days into the journey, leaving them only one rudder with which to steer. \u201cYes, we are safe and well. We were always safe, we just couldn\u2019t let anyone know,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had plenty of food and saw lots of whales.\u201d Langdon said his daughter was \u201chappy\u201d but that they were both tired, and planned to spend the night in an Ulladulla motel. Australian Border Force agents have requested for the Langdons to travel north to Port Kembla harbour. Langdon is an experienced sailor and Que has spent much of her young life living on board boats. Langdon and his daughter sailed out of Kawhia harbour on the west coast of New Zealand\u2019s North Island on 17 December. The were formally reported missing on 27 December, having made no contact with other vessels of the coastguard. The Royal New Zealand Air Force, coast guard and marine patrols launched a massive aerial and sea search, scouring an area as far as 65km offshore. Interpol was also alerted in case the boat crossed international waters. Other ships and boats in the region were asked to report any sightings."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
