The 29-year-old, who made his debut against Albania in March 2001, will make his 86th appearance against Montenegro this evening with Capello following Sansom and the likes of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho this week in praising the defender's qualities. The former Chelsea manager anticipates Cole going on to become England's most capped outfield player with Sansom, who also played at Arsenal and Crystal Palace, hopeful that he receives a generous reception at Wembley this evening. While Cole's relationship with the England support has occasionally proved fractious, his worth to his national manager remains clear. \"The number of caps he has is not a surprise to me,\" said Capello. \"He is a really good player, strong when he has to defend and dangerous when he goes forward. He is one of the best left-backs in the world. He's intelligent, his movement is clever and he is quick. \"He passes the ball well but when he arrives up-field, he knows what he has to do where other players are less effective in those areas. His crossing is accurate and dangerous. He is a player who wants the ball and is always aware.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
