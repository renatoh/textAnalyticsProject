But that is what happened to the runner from Devon after she fell ill during the closing stages of the Great North Run. Pavey had to be supported by race officials after crossing the finishing line at South Shields in fourth place having completed the 13.1 miles from Newcastle, and she was taken for treatment. \"I was really disappointed because I wanted to do better than that,\" she said. \"I was really enjoying it and looking forward to the bit on the seafront but then it was like flicking a switch and I felt really weird. \"By 800 metres to go I felt delirious. I feel really drunk now - like I've had two bottles of wine. It was not like I felt more and more tired - one second I was fine, and one second I wasn't. With 800 metres to go I didn't think I would make it. My hands were blue for ages after the race.\" Yet the Commonwealth Games silver medallist over 5,000 metres still had plenty of reason to take heart from an encouraging first attempt at the distance, one which suggested her future will one day lie in the marathon. Her time of 70min 42sec was just over a minute slower than Radcliffe achieved on her debut at this distance five years ago. \"I want to try again and do it right,\" said Pavey, who received encouraging words at the end from Radcliffe, whose pregnancy confined her to the commentary box. \"I'd like to give it another go but I need some answers.\" Up until the final downhill section, which turns on to the coast road where the race finishes, and where she lost touch with the leaders, Pavey had been in contention with an illustrious group of runners. Berhane Adere, the Ethiopian who was such a thorn in Radcliffe's side when she was racing on the track, broke away to win on her fifth attempt at the race in 70:03. She beat Benita Johnson, Australia's 2004 world cross-country champion, and Susan Chepkemei, the Kenyan Radcliffe beat in the New York City marathon two years ago. South Africa's Hendrick Ramaala won the men's race for the third time in five appearances when he claimed an emphatic victory in 61:03. He looked a likely winner when he joined Ethiopia's Dejene Berhanu and the American Dathan Ritzenhein in a breakaway from the start of a race started by the England football team's head coach, Steve McClaren. Ramaala, 34, was unable to shake off his rivals until the 11-mile mark despite numerous injections of pace but he then surged ahead to open up a decisive gap which saw him finish 19sec ahead of the second-placed Berhanu with Ritzenhein 3sec further back in his first half-marathon. \"It was the slowest of my three victories but it was much easier than in 2003 when I had to go all out in the finishing straight,\" said Ramaala. \"It was kind of a tactical race, especially compared with last year when the guy just went from the start. I was saving myself for the finish because I know Berhanu has a finish. I know at his best he can fly.\" A record 80,000 people applied for the 50,000 places - despite the deaths of four runners last year. Extra safety measures and medical cover were introduced but the race organisers, Nova, yesterday announced a 29-year-old man had collapsed and died in this year's event. Among those taking part were the family of Reuben Wilson, who died in last year's silver jubilee race. \"To be honest, I don't actually like running,\" said Miriam Wilson, one of his sisters. \"But we're doing it for a good cause and that's the main thing.\" A number of celebrities took part, but surely the bravest runners were Sonia O'Sullivan and Craig Mottram, the 2000 Olympic 5,000m silver medallist and World Cup 5,000m champion respectively, who jogged round in Sunderland shirts - after being encouraged to do so by Steve Cram."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
