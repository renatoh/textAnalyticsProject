We got the inside take on the best this unspoilt gem has to offer, from locals in the know: photographer and gallery owner Dee Kramer, Shellharbour Square Fish Market manager Miles Williams, and Rebecca Dunning, owner of Stand Up Paddle Boarding Shellharbour. 1. Bushwalk Macquarie Pass National Park \u201cOne of the most picturesque spots in Shellharbour is Macquarie Pass National Park,\u201d says Dee Kramer, who spends his time observing the natural wonders of the Illawarra region from behind a camera and, more recently, a drone. \u201cThe Cascades walk is wonderful. It takes less than an hour and there\u2019s a beautiful waterfall at the end.\u201d Higher up the pass is the Clover Hill trail, an old logging route through rainforest and open fields to Rainbow Falls, with plenty of wildlife and birdwatching opportunities. 2. Killalea National Surfing Reserve Discovered by surfers in the 60s, Killalea was declared a National Surfing Reserve in 2009. \u201cIt\u2019s a magic spot,\u201d Kramer says. Visitors can book a surf lesson at Killalea Beach (also known as The Farm) or Minnamurra Beach (AKA Mystics) or stay dry on the bushwalking trails. Killalea is a picnicker\u2019s heaven and the kiosk serves coffee and light meals. 3. Book a stay Reserve one of 50 spacious unpowered camping sites and wake up to enjoy the full glory of Killalea Reserve before the day trippers arrive. There are barbecue sites and a camp kitchen, and bigger groups might consider the backpacker-style bunkhouse options for six or four. Reflections Killalea Reserve has a $10 Tuesday deal in June if you book a three-night midweek stay. If camping is not your style, check out Shellharbour Beachside Holiday Park for a stay in a beachside cottage, spa cabin, family cabin or beach hut. 4. Bass Point Indigenous Cultural Walk With six shipwrecks and undersea cliffs to explore, the heritage-listed Bushrangers Bay Aquatic Reserve at Bass Point Reserve is a much-loved diving and snorkelling spot. Back on shore you can follow a series of interpretive signs to learn about the significance of this beautiful location to the Indigenous Wodi Wodi people. A traditional camping and meeting area, Bass Point Reserve is recognised as one of the most important archaeological sites on the New South Wales coast. 5. Lake Illawarra art trail With the escarpment looming behind and the coast on its other shore, Lake Illawarra is a natural playground for Shellharbour residents. Kramer recommends cycling around the picturesque lake, stopping to view sculptures by local artists and read up on local history, Aboriginal heritage, and flora and fauna en route. 6. Navigate Lake Illawarra The cycle path can also be walked, of course, but Miles Williams reckons the best way to enjoy Lake Illawarra is by boat. \u201cLake Illawarra is great for young kids,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of places to fish along the foreshore and it\u2019s nice and safe.\u201d Bream, whiting, blackfish, flathead and flounder are all there to be caught, Williams says. \u201cYou can even hire boats for half a day, delivered to you at the foreshore, no licence required.\u201d 7. Stand up at sunrise Catch the tranquility of Lake Illawarra as the sun rises, the reward for making it to the Stand Up Paddleboard jump-off point in Reddall Parade at 6.30am. \u201cOne lady comes every Friday morning,\u201d says Rebecca Dunning, owner of Stand Up Paddle Boarding Shellharbour, who assures us the water is warmer than the frost on the grass. Dunning\u2019s boards are long and wide to give learners the best possible chance of staying dry. She will also turn a blind eye to waterproof ugg boots. 8. Seafood and eat it Licensed local fishermen sell their catch direct to the Fish Market at Shellharbour, and Williams says winter bargains include mirror dory and gemfish as the cold water fish start coming around. Williams names fine dining restaurant Relish on Addison and new poke bowl hub Nourished at Shellharbour as go-tos for seafood lovers. Or pick up fish and chips - and a fishing rod - from lakeside Pep\u2019s Takeaway or from the foreshore\u2019s Olympic Take-Away. 9. The Farm\u2019s Market On the first Sunday of the month, Killalea Reserve hosts The Farm\u2019s Market, in arguably the most picturesque setting on the South Coast. Pick up all manner of locally produced goods, from wholefoods to flowers and have a chat to brewers and artisans while the kids roam the grassy headland. \u201cThere are up to 100 stalls,\u201d Williams says. \u201cAnd live music. It\u2019s a great day out with the most spectacular views.\u201d 10. Tee off at The Links A hidden gem of a course, The Links Shell Cove is an 18-holer occupying a slice of land between the Princes Highway and Killalea Reserve. Buy a bucket of balls for a hit at the driving range, book a lesson with a pro, or strike out on your own. Book ahead if you want to dine at the on-site restaurant with views of the course and the escarpment. 11. Planes, trains and automobiles Aspiring aviators will love the hands-on experience at the HARS Aviation Museum, run by the Historical Aircraft Restoration Society at Illawarra Regional Airport, Albion Park Rail. \u201cYou can hop into planes including a F1-11 and have a good look around,\u201d Kramer says. Take a walk along the wing of a Qantas Boeing 747, or a enjoy a cockpit tour. You\u2019re on the spot for joy flights in a helicopter too. Next door to the airport is the Illawarra Light Railway Museum, providing steam, diesel and miniature train rides. And if motoring is more your speed, nearby Kembla Grange is home to the Australian Motorlife Museum and its collection of cars, bikes and memorabilia - including a display dedicated to local hero, former world motorcycling champion Wayne Gardner. 12. Bliss out at Love Yoga Stretch out and breathe in a Vinyasa yoga class at the new Shellharbour studio Love Yoga. Georgia Adye\u2019s class line-up focuses on mindful movement, breathing, meditation and relaxation at various intensity levels. In cooler months, Love Yoga uses a far-infrared radiant heating system to keep the studio cosy and boost blood circulation and relaxation during sessions.
