Biden leads the electoral college vote tally 264-214 after he was declared the winner in Michigan and Wisconsin on Wednesday and Trump gained one vote in Maine. Adding Alaska for Trump \u2013 which had not been called but where the result is not in doubt \u2013 gives the president 217. From there, four states remained to be called as of Friday: Nevada, North Carolina, Georgia, and Pennsylvania. Trump\u2019s paths For Trump to find the 53 electoral votes he needs, he would need to win Pennsylvania, plus all three other states. But a huge Democratic vote share remained to be tallied in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, meaning Trump could have difficulty hanging on to a narrow lead gained elsewhere in the state. Biden\u2019s paths Biden has more paths to find his remaining six electoral votes. One path lies through Pennsylvania, which would net 20 votes. Without Pennsylvania, Biden could win by winning Nevada, where he held a clear but narrow lead. A Biden victory in either of the two reddest states in the mix \u2013 Georgia or North Carolina \u2013 would almost certainly foretell wins elsewhere and a Biden victory."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
