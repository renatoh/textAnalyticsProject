But there was a time when our financial institutions were more granite and sandstone than steel, plastic and glass. The Bank of England, better known for its fine-tuning of interest rates than its fine architecture, was, for much of its history, a great patron. Its headquarters on Threadneedle street are a case in point. Designed by John Soane, it was a physical expression of all the bank was supposed to stand for \u2013 stability, safety, imperial power (there were plenty of Greek and Roman flourishes). Then, as now, things were not as stable as they appeared. After the infamous panic of 1825, it was decided that the bank should set up outposts in major regional centres. These magnificent columned halls, in Liverpool, Manchester, Plymouth and Bristol, were designed by Charles Robert Cockerell. Of these, all but the Plymouth branch survive. Liverpool's, on Castle street, was described by Pevsner as \"combining Greek, Roman and Renaissance in a remarkably vigorous and inventive way. Only three bays wide, but overwhelmingly massive and powerful\". Architectural gravitas was not enough to prevent financial crises, of course, but the seriousness with which the bank took the design of its buildings is something to be grateful for. It's hard to imagine the City's recent crop of plate-glass clones winning similar accolades."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
