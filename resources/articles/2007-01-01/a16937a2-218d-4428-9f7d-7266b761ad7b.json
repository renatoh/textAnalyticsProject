The US food regulator, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), recently declared meat and milk from cloned cattle, pigs and goats to be safe for human consumption, pushing such products a step closer to the supermarket shelf. Cloning is no longer just the stuff of science fiction, and students need to be aware of the implications of this development. Introduce the issue into the classroom by viewing a brief BBC news report: http://news.bbc.co.uk/nolavconsole/ukfs_news/hi/nb_wm_fs.stm?news=1&amp;nbram=1&amp;nbwm=1&amp;bbram=1&amp;bbwm=1&amp;nol_storyid=6216043. The next step in the US is a period of consultation on whether to allow the sale of cloned animal products. Challenge students to provide an information leaflet to help the average person make up his or her mind on the issue. Their leaflet should be informative rather than persuasive. Finding the facts Initially, students will need to find out about what cloning is. A fun introduction is the Clone Zone, downloadable from Planet Science (www.planet-science.com/parents/fun_pack/games.html). As well as some colourful cartoon clones to spot, there's an array of facts to introduce some of the issues. The BBC has a useful quick guide to cloning (http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/5098286.stm) and Guardian Unlimited has a clear interactive guide (www.theguardian.com/flash/0,5860,534450,00.html). More detailed information can be found at the Human Genome Project website (www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/cloning.shtml). Challenge students to explain (in their leaflets) the different types of cloning (embryo, reproductive, therapeutic) and to create a cartoon strip that describes reproductive cloning. Cloning first really hit the headlines with the birth of Dolly the sheep, the first mammal to be successfully cloned from an adult cell. The Science Museum has a neat and accessible guide to Dolly (www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/antenna/dolly/index.asp) and the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh, which created Dolly, has useful pages, too (www.roslin.ac.uk/publicInterest/cloning.php). A worksheet for older students, with information and questions about Dolly, can be found at www.bbsrc.ac.uk/society/engagement/schools/resources/case_studies/Welcome.html Dolly died in 2003 but she has been preserved and can be seen face-to-face at the National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh (www.nms.ac.uk/me2.aspx). Dolly's death raised questions about the health, longevity and life quality of cloned animals. She developed a serious illness, and many cloned animals do not live long lives. Indeed, about 98% of clonings are not successful, with most clones dying before birth or just after. Consequently, cloning animals is an expensive business. It is currently used to clone elite animals from which to breed. Many scientists believe it will be a means to provide for the world's increasing food demands. Others are working on preserving endangered species and reproducing favourite pets. There is even talk of one day reviving extinct species. Opponents to cloning, however, are concerned about safety and ethical issues, claiming, for example, that there are a host of potential problems when so many cloned animals are born with illnesses or abnormalities. They worry, too, that high levels of hormones and antibiotics given to the surrogate mothers of cloned animals will enter the food supply. The greatest controversy, of course, is whether to allow the cloning of humans, which is prohibited by UK law (punishable by 10 years in prison). Students can investigate the legalities of cloning at www.bionetonline.org/English/Content/sc_leg1.htm - it is undoubtedly the holy grail of many scientists around the world. Despite the risks and the low success rate, some believe it will help childless couples or recreate exceptional individuals. Students can investigate the arguments for and against, using the excellent links at Planet Science, where they are asked to debate whether to use cloning to improve Britain's footballers (www.planet-science.com/sciteach/index.html?page=/sciteach/debating/cloning.html). Food labelling If products from cloned animals are sold in the UK, will we be peering at labels looking for cloned content? The FDA, in the US, sees no need for labelling. Discuss with students whether they feel it is important information for consumers. Food labelling is already a hot issue in the UK. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is running an advertising campaign to promote \"traffic light\" food labelling to help consumers better understand food content. The system has been adopted by some supermarkets (eg Sainsbury's, the Co-op, Waitrose) but others fear that traffic lighting will demonise certain foods and have developed their own systems, which has led to accusations of confusion and misleading labels. Set up some research asking each student to look up and report back on the labelling of a basic product, eg a cereal. Compare the different labelling and judge its clarity and usefulness. Finally, explore the FSA traffic lights system (www.eatwell.gov.uk/foodlabels/trafficlights/) and challenge students to create an advert (eg poster, radio, TV) to explain the system. Encourage them to look out for the FSA advertising being launched this month and compare it with their own ideas.
