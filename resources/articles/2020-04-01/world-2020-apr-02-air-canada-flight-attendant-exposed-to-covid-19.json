I had to sit down on the sidewalk,\u201d said the veteran flight attendant. Throbbing muscle pains cascaded through her body, accompanied by an \u201ceerie dry throat\u201d that she had never before experienced. Wilson, who works for Air Canada and asked to use a pseudonym, had recently completed a return flight from Toronto to Frankfurt and back. Accustomed to occasional discomforts caused by her job, she waved off the symptoms. \u201cI\u2019m not really a hypochondriac. I didn\u2019t honestly think, \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019ve got the coronavirus\u2019 or anything.\u201d That evening, however, a fever had set in, and her chest became tight, as if \u201csomeone was yanking an elastic from either end\u201d of her lungs. By the next morning, with her body weak and racked by chills, Wilson\u2019s calmness had given way to full-blown panic. Within days, she was quarantined in the basement, but her family also began showing symptoms, prompting the grim realization that she had probably infected her loved ones with Covid-19. Wilson\u2019s experience highlights what many in her profession increasingly view as dangerous work, as the virus passes between travelers and flight crews enclosed for hours on long-haul flights. And as borders close and governments advise their citizens to return home, Wilson fears that infected crew members \u2013 some of whom will remain asymptomatic \u2013 have become \u201csuper spreaders\u201d of the coronavirus, potentially infecting many more. When Wilson first realized something was wrong, she resisted a visit to the hospital \u2013 worried she might be adding an unnecessary burden on to Canada\u2019s healthcare system which was already feeling the strain of the first wave of Covid-19 victims. But she relented after speaking with a pulmonologist, and was tested for the coronavirus at a Toronto hospital. Doctors told her to return home and to remain in self-isolation as she waited for the results. \u201cI had sleepless nights, which didn\u2019t help me as I tried to get over the illness. I thought about my family, but could only ever see them through FaceTime,\u201d she said. Her only real-world interaction with them was the meals delivered to the top step of the basement stairs. After six days the test came through positive, but by then, Wilson had learned she wasn\u2019t the only one from her flight to be infected. Seven other Air Canada staff members \u2013 two deadheading pilots and five flight attendants \u2013 had tested positive for Covid-19 following the return trip to Germany. The crew had been flying a Boeing 777-300, the company\u2019s largest plane. Depending on configuration, it can hold as many as 450 passengers. \u201cWe call it a high-density aircraft,\u201d she said. \u201cIronic, I know.\u201d The two pilots who tested positive had been sitting in business class. Wilson had been working in the back of the plane, on the opposite side of the aircraft. \u201cIt led me to believe that there were many people who were Covid-19 positive on that flight,\u201d she said. Meanwhile, Wilson\u2019s family also began developing symptoms \u2013 fevers, breathing difficulties and body pains. As she battled a fever and aching body, she was also overwhelmed by guilt \u2013 believing if she had acted sooner, recognizing the symptoms as the coronavirus \u2013 she could have spared her two daughters and husband. While the family\u2019s symptoms are mild compared with thousands of cases that require hospitalization and intubation, the virus nonetheless also took an immense mental toll. \u201cI only was trying to consume minimal media about coronavirus, because we\u2019re all living it. But the uncertainty just eats away at your mental health,\u201d she said. \u201cFor days, I couldn\u2019t fall asleep. For hours on end, I was shaking and my mind was racing. It\u2019s been tough.\u201d In recent days, as more flight attendants and their families test positive for Covid-19, Air Canada has dramatically stepped up precautions on flights. In-flight service has been curtailed to minimize interactions with passengers. Flight crew have access to N95 masks and surgical-level gloves. The company also screens passengers for any sign they might have the virus \u2013 and will deny boarding to anyone displaying symptoms. Unions representing flight attendants say the moves are not enough, and say face shields and gowns are also needed. At least 14 flight attendants in Canada have tested positive for the virus and hundreds are in quarantine after suspected exposure. Wilson, who has been temporarily laid off alongside 16,000 other Air Canada employees, is skeptical of policies meant to prevent the further spread of Covid-19. \u201cIf I was flying with my symptoms, I would not have triggered any alarm bells. If you\u2019re not heading to ICU or needing a respirator, you can totally get by with not showing any symptoms,\u201d she said. \u201cThe headaches, the fever \u2013 they all went away with Tylenol and ibuprofen.\u201d Wilson doesn\u2019t believe \u2013 given what was known at the time \u2013 that her infection could have been avoided. She had worn gloves, washed her hands and minimized contact with travelers. But as new research reveals the efficiency with which the virus can establish infection, such precautions may not always be enough. \u201cWe got it from passengers. That\u2019s a fact,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now, we\u2019re a part of the spread. We\u2019re the super spreaders, as people frantically fly home.\u201d The one upside of her family testing positive was that Wilson was able to leave the basement \u2013 if only to enter quarantine with her husband and daughters. Now, they are slowly recovering, but the anxiety seems likely to leave a lasting mark. \u201cWhenever we all start to feel better, I read a story about someone dying and I get anxious again. I\u2019m just freaking out,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s this overwhelming uncertainty over how it\u2019s going to going affect the next person you know \u2013 how it might impact my sister or my brother or my mother. It\u2019s absolutely heart-wrenching.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
