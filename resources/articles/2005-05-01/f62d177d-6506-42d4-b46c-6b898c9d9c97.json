Rosemary concentrates on Spanish classes, I concentrate on history classes and cello. Although my playing is still fairly poor, the tone weedy, the notes rarely spot on and the sound of it would drive my poor mother to drink if only she could swallow, how fortunate that I plodded on with it and can play in an orchestra. This is the perfect thing to do when one is trying not to think of catheters, bedsores and a wasted Mama. Stop concentrating for two seconds and the Beethoven has galloped away without you. And if orchestras are not up your street, I recommend going back to school. If this century stinks, why not plunge into another one? I have plumped for the 18th - best music, best jokes. And Rosemary is riveted to her Spanish dictionary. She trots along to her class, she concentrates like mad, but all too soon she must wade back into the morass of her normal life: her unplanted seeds, her unreturned library books, countless hours spent crouching in front of the little clock sign, fiddling and wondering how to stop the central heating and hot water blazing all through summer, and a message written to herself: \"Ring Janet on Friday.\" Who the hell is Janet? Which Friday? Has she already rung this person? But at least, for a short while now and again, we can block out the world. We have suddenly learned how to brush aside our problems and compartmentalise. Until now I had thought this an exclusively male skill. But no. Elderly women can do it too. When I was young and in love, I couldn't concentrate for toffee. But now it is a breeze and a fabulous escape. No wonder chaps do it at every opportunity. Sadly, Fielding's main distraction is something of a disappointment. \"The brain locks into the logic and aesthetic of footer,\" he drones, and blabbers a hymn of praise to Rooney: his spatial awareness, defiance of gravity, top-spinned, side-spinned and curled balls, and tonight's game is crucial. Or he wallows in rock'n'roll, or Tommy Cooper videos. \"It's an escape from this crap election and the tragic universe,\" he cries dramatically. Not too tragic. When the sun shines, it looks rather charming. My mother doesn't want to leave it. I can see why."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
