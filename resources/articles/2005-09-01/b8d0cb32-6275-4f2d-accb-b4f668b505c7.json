Here, Mike Skinner can produce strange-sounding sonics for the equally weird yet wonderful wanderings of Roll Deep's Trimbal and no one bats a lash. Kano and Ghetto's voracious Mic Check remix also sounds superb, sandwiched between the conscious concerns of JME's Serious and Lady Sovereign's ragascruffin Little Bit of Shhh! Whether hip-hop, garage or bashment-based, as long as the accents and slang are strictly UK, the lyrics sharp and insightful and the beats brilliant and bold, then everyone's allowed in. And that includes the women: 17-year-old producer Mizz Beats' beautifully menacing Saw It Coming inspires Wiley to spit some of the most revealing rhymes he's written in months. With not one duff track, the main problem with this album is tearing it from the stereo; a world without Bear Man, Plan B, Doctor, Big Seac, Crazy Titch, Bruza, Jammer and Klashnekoff seems suddenly dull. A must for aficionados and novices alike."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
