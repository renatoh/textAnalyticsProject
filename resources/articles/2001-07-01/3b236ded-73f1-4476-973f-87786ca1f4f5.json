United are poised to break the British transfer record for the second time in three months after finally agreeing personal terms with Juan Veron to seal a \u00a324.6m move from Lazio last night. Arsenal signed Ipswich\u0092s England goalkeeper Richard Wright in a deal believed to be worth \u00a36m. United have finalised a package that will make Veron the highest-paid player in the club\u0092s history, with a weekly salary in excess of \u00a380,000. The deal, which remains subject to Veron\u0092s medical examination, will reaffirm United\u0092s intent to match the financial muscle of their leading European rivals, having already signed Ruud van Nistelrooy from PSV Eindhoven for \u00a319.5m. Sir Alex Ferguson is determined to mark his final year in office by returning the European Cup to Old Trafford and has apparently persuaded the club\u0092s hierarchy to back him. He is still looking for a goalkeeper and a central defender. The 26-year-old Veron has built a reputation as one of the world\u0092s most influential midfielders during his time in Serie A, with spells at Lazio, Parma and Sampdoria as well as a wealth of international experience with Argentina. He is expected to fly to England in the next couple of days for a medical at a private hospital in Cheshire. If all goes to plan, he will be introduced to his new teammates when they report for pre-season training on Monday. \u0093I don\u0092t foresee any problems,\u0094 he said. \u0093Everything I have heard about Manchester United has been positive and I am looking forward to testing myself in England. This has removed a burden from me and naturally I am very satisfied.\u0094 When he was acquitted last week of using falsified documents to obtain a European Union passport it opened the way for United\u0092s chief executive Peter Kenyon to intensify the club\u0092s efforts to lure him away from Rome. Internazionale, to name but one, launched a late attempt to beat United\u0092s bid but seemingly to no avail. \u0093We have struck a deal with Manchester United. I would expect that everything is completed early next week,\u0094 Lazio\u0092s president Sergio Cragnotti confirmed yesterday, when it was also announced that he plans to quit the club and sell his controlling stake. Arsenal\u0092s signing of the 23-year-old Wright could spell the end of the 37-year-old David Seaman\u0092s first-team reign. \u0093We looked for somebody who can challenge David Seaman straight away, and I think Richard can do that,\u0094 said their manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. But Feyenoord are not happy that Arsenal have jilted their Polish international goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek. \u0093They broke their agreement to sign Dudek and left us with a frustrated player,\u0094 said their president Jorien van den Herik. \u0093If [the Arsenal vice-chairman David] Dein doesn\u0092t come up with a satisfactory explanation we may sue.\u0092\u0092 Wenger said that Wright, who is understood to have signed a five-year deal, would be his last acquisition of the summer unless he could finalise a deal for the 21-year-old Gamba Osaka and the Japan midfielder Junichi Inamoto. Mustapha Hadji has signed a four-year deal with Aston Villa to complete a \u00a34.5m move from Coventry that involves a part exchange with the \u00a32.5m-rated Julian Joachim."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
