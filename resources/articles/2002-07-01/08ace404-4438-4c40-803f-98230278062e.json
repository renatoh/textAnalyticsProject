They have sauntered through this World Cup, shamelessly taking advantage of the elimination of the fancied sides, profiting from dodgy refereeing decisions as they strode on ruthlessly towards the final, but eventually - praise be! - they got theirs. The bookies, I mean. Those of us following the advice of ITV's panellist Andy Townsend, who confidently predicted Brazil to win 2-0 in 90 minutes, finally got to recoup some of our unwise investments in France/Portugal/Italy etc. Admittedly, and typically, William Hill was offering only a miserly 6-1, but that was the only cloud on a beautiful day for the beautiful game. It was the result everybody wanted: the bookies having to shell out for once, and defeat for Germany - or as I ought to call them, \"The Germans\". I am grateful to Leon Wilson, who writes to me to note \"with regret\" that on several occasions I have failed to describe Germany as The Germans. \"If you check your Football Pundits' Handbook,\" writes Leon, \"you will see it clearly states that at all times the Aryan supermen must be referred to as 'The Germans' and not 'Germany' - thereby reversing the normal naming of international teams. \"May I suggest you reread this section of the handbook. It also offers sound advice on exactly when phrases such as 'clinical efficiency' and 'machine' can be used in connection with 'The Germans'; ie as much as possible.\" He adds: \"Seven World Cup finals for The Germans and not a single memorable goal, move or moment from them in any tournament - fancy that. The Football Pundits' Union continues to suppress moments of excellence from The Germans being broadcast on UK television.\" So, anyway, there I was with two televisions on - the first time I have tried to watch both sides simultaneously, and not an overwhelming success - and my notebook poised to note just how beastly we were to The Germans. Goodness me, I could have done with two notebooks as well, as references to \"The Germans\" pinged between the TV sets like a rally at Wimbledon. \"Will the brilliance of Brazil beat the efficiency of the Germans?\" asked Des. \"You have to give the Germans credit,\" countered Alan Hansen, and so it continued. Giving credit to the Germans, of course, is not generally regarded as a vital ingredient of soccer punditry in this country. Bobby Robson, for instance - the only analyst, I believe, to note that Germany had reached the World Cup final without five of their very best players - went about as far as we are prepared to go. \"You have to, you know, to some degree, er, admire them,\" he said glumly. If the former World Cup player Uli H\u00f6ness is to be believed, the Germans would be far less grudging were it us in the final. H\u00f6ness, on Radio 5 Live on Saturday, said German fans had a more mature attitude to international football rivalries. \"May I remind you in England that the war ended fifty years ago,\" he said. And there was the 5 Live reporter trying awfully hard not to mention the war. The other hostilities - between BBC and ITV - were also wrapped up yesterday (\"For you, Herr Lynam, ze World Cup is over\") with the BBC winning in audience terms but ITV contributing greatly to the entertainment, not unlike Germ . . . sorry, The Germans. Despite a torrent of email disagreeing, I stick to my view that ITV picked the better squad; not only Townsend, who has been the Trevor Sinclair of the tournament, a fringe player who forced his way into the first team and then fully justified his place, but also Robson, whose \"lovely boy\" Ronaldo won it and had Sir Bob filling up, and Terry Venables, tactically still miles ahead of any other pundit. Honourable mentions too for Matt Smith, a superb anchor for the late highlights show, and for Robbie Earle and Gary Neville, who contributed the odd unexpected nugget. We will overlook Graham Taylor and Gazza. I found the BBC too jokey by half, suffering from what we doctors call Question of Sport-itis, the belief that when two or more sports personalities are gathered together they need to be joshing with each other, and giggling, as though in the clubhouse at a pro-celebrity golf tournament; which the BBC panel sometimes resembled. For instance, by the time the final whistle had gone yesterday most of us had come to terms with Ronaldo's haircut. Not Gary Lineker, though. \"The first time I saw it,\" chortled Gary, \"Ha, ha, I thought he had massive eyebrows.\" Cue collapse into paroxysms of helpless mirth of panel of pundits. This is not what we want from the BBC pundits. What we want is a tip from Martin O'Neill about the Leeds job, so we can really make those bookies pay."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
