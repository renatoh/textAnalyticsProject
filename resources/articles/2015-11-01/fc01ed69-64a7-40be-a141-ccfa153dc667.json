It was the Villa owner\u2019s love and long-term vision for the club that sold the job to the former Lyon coach, according to Garde, despite Lerner\u2019s desire to sell up. The American billionaire has turned to a coach without Premier League managerial experience, and who has been out of the game for over a year due to personal reasons, to save a team that last won a league point on 29 August and has merely four in total with almost a third of the season gone. \u201cI feel the club is in a hole,\u201d said Sherwood shortly before he was sacked last month. A dreamer is the last thing Villa need in the circumstances. \u201cIn football, things can change,\u201d said Garde, who has signed a three-and-a-half-year contract and begins his reign at home to the leaders Manchester City on Sunday. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t think I could change things I would have said \u2018No, this job is not for me\u2019, but I\u2019ve got the hope that we can do it. I don\u2019t know what happened before, I was not inside and I can\u2019t judge. I can only focus on what will happen from now on. \u201cI haven\u2019t the certainty we will stay in the Premier League because the situation we are in is difficult but I have strong belief we will do it. \u201cI\u2019m not a dreamer or a magic man, I have strong ideas. Maybe that was why I stopped at Lyon \u2013 because you need strong energy for what I want to do \u2013 but now I think there are things I want to change. That is not saying what went on before was wrong. There is not only one way to win games but I have my ideas and a strategy that I want to implement.\u201d Garde\u2019s friendship with Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, who managed the former midfielder at Arsenal between 1996-99, had been cited as a key factor in the 49-year-old\u2019s decision to follow his compatriot\u2019s advice and take the Villa job. While admitting Wenger and the ex-Villa manager G\u00e9rard Houllier are trusted confidants, Garde insists his return to England had no outside influence. \u201cI had made my decision 98% before I read what Ars\u00e8ne said,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t make this kind of decision because someone said I should. I have big respect for Ars\u00e8ne Wenger but I\u2019m not crazy enough to say \u2018OK, let\u2019s go\u2019 because Ars\u00e8ne said so. He is not sat here next to me with this job.\u201d Garde confirmed he rejected a previous offer to manage in the Premier League \u2013 from Newcastle United in January \u2013 having given Lyon his word he needed an extended sabbatical from the game. \u201cThat time I was not ready to start again after leaving Lyon,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to stay honest to the chairman.\u201d The Frenchman also claimed he was \u201cnot desperate\u201d to return to the game nor depressed at being out of it, but had a feeling for Villa following talks with Lerner and the club\u2019s chief executive, Tom Fox. He explained: \u201cI had a very good feeling from speaking with the owner, with the way he wanted to fix this bad situation. I think the feeling and the way people share ideas about the future is important in a club. If not, it could be difficult. I love how they want to make Villa for the future, so I agreed.\u201d But that does not tally with Lerner\u2019s attempts to sell the club he purchased in 2006. \u201cYou have to ask the owner about that,\u201d Garde replied. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you the private conversation I had but he never appeared to me to be wanting to sell the club. He loves the club and I was very impressed with how he spoke about Villa. He gave me the belief. To be honest, I was surprised to see how much he loved the club. He made me want to work with him. I can\u2019t speak in the name of Randy Lerner, I have only just met him, but he did not seem to be a man who doesn\u2019t love the club and doesn\u2019t care \u2013 it was the opposite.\u201d The new Villa manager insisted he had no qualms about working with a transfer committee, a source of clear frustration for Sherwood. Garde said: \u201cIt is something we are used to in France. What\u2019s important is that I will have the final say. I can\u2019t watch all the games. The organisation is a support, not something I will fight against. We will have discussions and I will say what I want.\u201d Garde\u2019s assistant manager, Reginald Ray, who had occupied the same position at Bastia, and his former fitness coach at Lyon, Robert Duverne, have joined the coach at Villa Park. Hopes of a swift reunion with his Lyon assistants G\u00e9rald Baticle and Bruno G\u00e9n\u00e9sio have been thwarted for the time being by the French club\u2019s owner, Jean-Michel Aulas."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
