The party will personally label Farage the \u201cex-Tory, ex-banker\u201d and rubbish Ukip\u2019s claims to be the party of the working man, as it prepares to descend on Doncaster for its party conference on Friday. Ukip\u2019s decision to hold its annual gathering in the northern town rather than a southern coastal stronghold is a direct challenge to Ed Miliband on his home turf. Farage is likely to make an appeal to voters who feel Labour\u2019s leadership have taken them for granted, particularly those with grievances about the impact of immigration on their local area. Labour has long been conflicted about how to deal with the threat of Ukip, with some arguing it should be ignored as the party poses a bigger threat to the Conservatives. However, senior shadow cabinet sources told the Guardian that the party needs to stop Ukip replicating the success of the SNP with poorer, less well-educated voters in Scotland. The threat might not be huge at this election but the appeal of Ukip could develop gradually over a number of years, one said. At the same time as Labour prepares to attack the party head-on, Ed Miliband and his shadow ministers have been referring disparagingly to a \u201cWestminster elite\u201d that must get back in touch with public concerns over the last week. Michael Dugher, the shadow cabinet office minister, said that on key issues \u2013 the NHS and living standards \u2013 Ukip is a \u201cparty of Tory people and Tory money\u201d. \u201cNow they want to go even further than the Tories by giving another tax cut to millionaires,\u201d he said. Dugher said an analysis of Ukip\u2019s tax plans show they are standing up for millionaires and the richest, not ordinary hardworking people, and are offering a tax cut worth more than \u00a3100,000 to more than 16,000 millionaires. \u201cThis multi-billion giveaway to the very richest at a time when families are struggling exposes Nigel Farage\u2019s fraudulent claims to be a friend of hard-working families. Ex-Tory, ex-banker Nigel Farage is showing his true colours. \u201cTory and Ukip policy platforms are merging: tax breaks for those at the top, working people left behind,\u201d Dugher added. Labour also claimed Ukip supports increased privatisation and charging to see a GP, although this is not official party policy. Dugher\u2019s position was backed up by Douglas Alexander, Labour\u2019s election co-ordinator, who said: \u201cWe need to be absolutely clear that Ukip represents a clear and present danger to working people.\u201d Nottingham University academic Matthew Goodwin has identified the typical profile of Ukip voters as blue-collar, struggling and left behind by the mainstream parties. Around 45% of the party\u2019s voters supported the Conservatives in 2010, while 15% gave their vote to the Lib Dems and 11% to Labour. However, there was evidence of Ukip\u2019s growing influence across the spectrum in the local elections, where the party averaged 20% in Conservative-held wards and 25% in Labour-held wards."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
