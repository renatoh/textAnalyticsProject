See! the mountains kiss high heaven, And the waves clasp one another; No sister flower would be forgiven, If it disdained it's brother; And the sunlight clasps the earth, And the moonbeams kiss the sea; - What are all these kissings worth, If thou kiss not me? To a Stranger by Walt Whitman Passing stranger! you do not know How longingly I look upon you, You must be he I was seeking, Or she I was seeking (It comes to me as a dream) I have somewhere surely Lived a life of joy with you, All is recall'd as we flit by each other, Fluid, affectionate, chaste, matured, You grew up with me, Were a boy with me or a girl with me, I ate with you and slept with you, your body has become not yours only nor left my body mine only, You give me the pleasure of your eyes, face, flesh as we pass, You take of my beard, breast, hands, in return, I am not to speak to you, I am to think of you when I sit alone or wake at night, alone I am to wait, I do not doubt I am to meet you again I am to see to it that I do not lose you. Low, sweet and low by Alice Cary Low, sweet and low, Sing to the shore, O Sea! And softly, softly, west wind, blow My lover's love to me; Blow and fill my heart with bliss As full as it can be. Light, low and light, Let your whisper, west wind, be, And tell me whether he sleeps to-night By the window nearest me! For if he loves me as I love him, 'Tis there his bed will be. Creep, west wind, creep Under the sheets, and see Whether or not his arms in sleep Are reaching out for me! For if the love of my love is mine, 'Tis thus his arms will be. About his pillow flit, And see if you will see A name in love's red letters writ On his cheek, then fly to me, For I know if a name is written there, Whose name the name must be!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
