According to the company and the mayor\u2019s office, Lyft\u2019s grant will pay for a participatory design process for the creation of new parklets and bike share stations, and a bike lending library. It will also provide subsidized local transit passes and Lyft rides in cars and on scooters for qualifying low-income residents in areas of Oakland where transportation infrastructure is chronically underfunded. But last year, Lyft and Uber lobbied Oakland officials to kill a proposed municipal tax of $0.50 per ride. According to city staff, the tax could have generated up to $2.5m per year when applied to the city\u2019s estimated 13,699 daily Uber and Lyft trips \u2013 substantially more than Lyft\u2019s recent donation. Lyft did not immediately respond to questions. Uber previously declined to comment on the record about the proposed Oakland tax. The ride-hailing tax was introduced by the councilmember Rebecca Kaplan in September 2017 to generate revenue to improve transportation and transit services, among other needs. To justify a new tax, Kaplan cited the rapid growth of Lyft and Uber in Oakland and said the pair are paying no tax to the city even while studies have shown they cause increased traffic congestion and wear and tear on city streets. \u201cThe use of a new technology, such as a smartphone app, to order a good or service, should not be a justification for tax evasion,\u201d Kaplan said at the time. However, other Oakland leaders have been hesitant to explore ride-hailing taxes. Instead, public records reveal that city leaders have sought ways to help Uber and Lyft bolster their corporate images by having them invest in city real estate or make grants to local not-for-profit organizations. For example, in 2016, the Oakland councilmember Larry Reid and Schaaf\u2019s staff sought a meeting with Uber officials to discuss the possibility of Uber buying the naming rights to the heavily indebted Oakland Coliseum, which is partly owned by the city. Oakland\u2019s elected officials also played the role of broker between Uber and various not-for-profit groups seeking grant funding during a time when Uber and its then CEO, Travis Kalanick, were attempting to rehabilitate the company\u2019s image. In one instance, Girls, Inc, an organization that works with young people in Oakland, wrote to Schaaf in August 2016 seeking a connection to \u201cthe powers that be at Uber\u201d. The group hoped to obtain a \u201csignificant grant\u201d. The mayor\u2019s office made the introduction. Later that year, an Oakland landlord wrote to Schaaf\u2019s staff seeking a meeting with Uber executives in the hope Uber would lease one of his company\u2019s properties to test autonomous vehicles, as Uber was already doing in Arizona. The mayor\u2019s staff forwarded the request to Uber\u2019s lobbyist with a quick note: \u201cLet\u2019s talk.\u201d By the time Kaplan proposed adding the $0.50 ride hailing tax to Oakland\u2019s November 2018 election ballot, few other city officials appeared supportive of the concept. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what the problem is we\u2019re trying to solve with this tax,\u201d said the councilmember Abel Guillen during a city hearing. Lobbying disclosure records show that Lyft officials met with Guillen to discuss \u201cmatters affecting transportation and the transportation network industry\u201d, as well as proposed regulations of scooters, which Lyft also operates. City records show that Uber\u2019s lobbyist had meetings with the mayor\u2019s chief of staff and multiple city councilmembers about the proposed tax measure throughout 2018. Lyft also joined the local Oakland Chamber of Commerce, and afterwards the chamber\u2019s lobbyist met with the mayor and several councilmembers to convince them that the ride-hailing tax was a bad idea. According to city records, the companies promoted \u201cmutually agreed upon pilot projects\u201d similar to Lyft\u2019s recently announced charitable grant, instead of the tax. At the final hearing on the proposed Lyft and Uber tax last July, a city council committee voted to kill the tax proposal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
