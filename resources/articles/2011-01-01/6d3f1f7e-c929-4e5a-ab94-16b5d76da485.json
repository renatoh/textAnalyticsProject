That was the challenge facing Ali Samadi Ahadi when he was working on his documentary about the abortive uprising, The Green Wave. The answer? Get online. The Green Wave is based on first-person accounts collected from tweets, Facebook entries and blogs. It features footage of protests and public gatherings shot on cell phones. But after the government militia turned on protesters and hauled them away to jail, the documentary trail ran cold. That's when Ahadi turned to animation. Ahadi's film captures the initial exhilaration of the green revolution. For a few exciting and heady days, he says, it really did appear inevitable that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad would be toppled from power and replaced by Mir Hossein Mousavi. The sheer numbers on the streets suggested the protests against the election results would be effective. \"These elections were unique,\" he says. \"The way people started to involve themselves was unbelievable.\" His plan was to collate personal experiences from the thousands of blogs and tweets written by the protesters. He created two fictional \"students\" whose experiences mirrored those of the real characters. There is more than 40 minutes of animation in the film and what it says is horrifying. Using eyewitness accounts alongside the animation, Ahadi depicts the squalor and brutality of the Iranian jails. The protesters suddenly found themselves locked up in dark, overcrowded cells. They were intimidated and tortured. Ahadi himself left Iran as a 13-year-old, and now lives in Germany; he last visited Iran in April 2009 \u2013 two months before the election. He hadn't intended to make a film about the failed green revolution at all. He had originally received support for a completely different documentary on Iran from German TV channel Arte. However, when the election appeared on the horizon, Arte allowed him to change tack. The animation was expensive and time-consuming but Ahadi was determined to make The Green Wave quickly. He eventually managed to complete the movie in just 10 months. He says he wasn't influenced directly by other political movies using animation, such as Waltz With Bashir and Persepolis. \"For me, animation was the only way to tell this story, to make this documentary.\" The imagery, he adds, was so strong and so disturbing that no physical re-enactment could do it justice. The fact that he was making The Green Wave abroad also pushed him towards the medium. \"It was the only very clear way to tell the story.\" While Ahadi was working on the movie, he heard stories about Jewish artists who had fled Germany for America during the Nazi era. \"They started to write a comic about a hero who came back to Europe and fought against Hitler and the Nazi regime. That was so interesting for me, to see the parallels with my film. When you are not able to tell a story in your country, you have to use another way. They used it 60 years ago also.\" Ahadi doesn't claim his film is an exhaustive account of everything that went on in Iran during June 2009. \"I don't say we all have all aspects of this time in the film. I don't say it is an objective view of the situation. It is a subjective, very personal view of the situation in Iran after the election.\" Whatever else, The Green Wave will certainly open people's eyes to what happened in Iranian jails. The Green Wave screens at the Sundance film festival on 21 January."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
