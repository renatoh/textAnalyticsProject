The article \u201cwent beyond political comment and showed the premier being the subject of potential significant violence\u201d, the media watchdog said. The Sunshine Coast Daily breached the press council\u2019s standards of practice which require papers to avoid a substantial risk to health or safety. \u201cThis could have been taken by some readers as condoning violence against the Premier or had the potential to trigger violence against the Premier,\u201d said the adjudication, published in Monday\u2019s Sunshine Coast Daily. The Queensland government lodged a complaint with the Australian Press Council in May on the grounds that the image encouraged violence against women, and asked the Rupert Murdoch-owned regional paper to remove the image and apologise. \u201cThe council considers it was deeply regrettable that the publication made the original decision to publish the image, initially refused to apologise and delayed in removing the image page from its digital platforms,\u201d the council said. \u201cHowever the council welcomes the prominent apology by the publication and its subsequent action in addressing the complaint.\u201d In May the Sunshine Coast Daily belatedly apologised. Its editor, Craig Warhurst, said sorry \u201cto those of you in the community who feel let down and betrayed by the image\u201d. The image accompanied an analysis of the federal election result in which the paper argued that the Queensland Labor leader was now in danger of losing power after her party\u2019s poor showing in the state. The acting Queensland police minister, Craig Crawford, was among those who called the image disgraceful, particularly in the context of an epidemic of violence against women. \u201cI don\u2019t condone a newspaper or anybody putting anybody\u2019s head in crosshairs,\u201d he told ABC radio in Brisbane. \u201cBecause that does incite violence. To some people out there it is an invitation to shoot the premier. There is absolutely no doubt what a person\u2019s face in crosshairs means.\u201d After the initial complaint the the paper\u2019s deputy editor, John Farmer, told Palaszczuk\u2019s office he did \u201cnot intend to pull down the front page from online, nor apologise\u201d and offered to publish a letter. \u201cThe front page is not an attempt to incite violence against the Premier,\u201d Farmer said. \u201cThis was never our intention and it would never be at any time. \u201cWhat the front page seeks to highlight is the fact that Labor\u2019s poor performance in the federal election in Queensland means the State Government is now in the political sights of the conservative parties in Queensland. A lot of that centres around the Adani process.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
