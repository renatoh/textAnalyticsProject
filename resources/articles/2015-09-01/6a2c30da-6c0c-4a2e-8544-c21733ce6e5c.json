The trend towards airtight houses could also worsen allergies as well as breathing problems, and even exacerbate lung cancer and heart problems, according to a leading expert in indoor air quality. Airborne pollutants created by cooking, cleaning and using aerosols such as hairsprays will increasingly stay indoors and affect people\u2019s health as homes are made ever more leak-proof to help meet carbon reduction targets, a report by Professor Hazim Awbi claims. Small amounts of chemicals found in detergents can stay on the fibres of washed clothes, be emitted into the air and combine with particulate matter from logs burned in a real fire, for example. \u201cPoor indoor air quality is connected with a range of undesirable health effects, such as allergic and asthma symptoms, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, airborne respiratory infections and cardiovascular disease,\u201d says the report written by Awbi, who is professor of the built environment at Reading University\u2019s school of construction management and engineering. \u201cWith the expected increase in airtightness for UK dwellings, it is anticipated that indoor air quality will generally become poorer, resulting in an increase in the number of cases of health symptoms related to poorer indoor environment quality.\u201d People with long-term health conditions and three groups who spend a lot of time indoors \u2013 young mothers, children and older people \u2013 will be particularly at risk, the report says. It predicts that by 2050 \u2013 the date by which Britain is supposed to have achieved an 80% cut in carbon emissions \u2013 declining indoor air quality could have led to: \u25a0 An 80% rise in the 5.4 million people already suffering from asthma. \u25a0 Concentrations of volatile organic compounds \u2013 chemicals linked to the use of aerosols \u2013 being 60% above World Health Organisation 24-hour limits. \u25a0 Nitrogen dioxide levels rising to 30% above the WHO\u2019s limits. The report\u2019s findings reflect growing concern that indoor pollutants, not just fumes and other chemicals in the outdoor environment, can damage health. The WHO has already identified indoor air quality as a health hazard. And Public Health England, an agency funded by the Department of Health, is finalising a report on \u201cclimate change and the domestic indoor environment\u201d, which it will publish before Christmas. Lack of proper ventilation in both newly built homes and those that have been refurbished to reduce their consumption of gas or electricity is storing up future health problems, Awbi said. \u201cMany people spend 70-80% of their time at home, or even as much as 90% indoors if you include workplaces. Given that the average person takes in 500 litres of air an hour, if the air you are breathing in is polluted, you can imagine how much of this pollution is going to be absorbed,\u201d he added. He fears that increasingly airtight houses in which too little fresh air gets in are causing indoor air quality to deteriorate and preventing pollutants from being dispersed quickly. Humidity caused by poor ventilation also helps the proliferation of mould and house dust mites, which can cause asthma and other allergic conditions, according to Professor Peter Howarth, a professor of allergy and respiratory diseases at Southampton University. Formaldehyde, a toxic gas emitted by wooden furniture, can also be problematic, added Howarth, who said he believed Awbi\u2019s estimates were a realistic assessment of the harm to human health if building regulations are not overhauled to improve ventilation and ensure \u201cair exchange\u201d. Simply opening windows to let in fresh air is not enough, and some form of mechanical ventilation is needed, according to Awbi. \u201cPoor indoor air quality can have a negative effect on people\u2019s health, including aggravating asthma,\u201d said Dr Sotiris Vardoulakis, Public Health England\u2019s\u2019s head of environmental change. \u201cWhile energy-efficient houses will help address climate change, it is important to ensure that adequate ventilation levels are maintained and indoor air pollution sources minimised to protect public health.\u201d Awbi\u2019s report was funded by Beama, a body which represents the UK\u2019s electro-technical industry, which includes firms that install ventilation systems. Andrew Proctor, director of advice and support at Asthma UK, said: \u201cWe know that indoor exposure to allergens can be a real problem for some people with asthma, but it is difficult to avoid them.\u201d The one in 11 Britons with asthma should always seek help promptly when they have symptoms suggesting an attack, he said. The Department for Energy and Climate Change said simply that government was committed to ensuring energy efficiency improvements in homes met the highest standards of installation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
