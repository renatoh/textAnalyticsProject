Tsunami waves caused by the earthquake have killed thousands of people in Sri Lanka. Test matches are currently scheduled at Hamilton from January 15-19 and at Wellington from January 22-26. \"Cricket is not the thing in our minds right now,\" said Sri Lanka's manager, Brendon Kuruppu. The country's short under-19 tour to Pakistan, which was due to begin on New Year's Eve, has been postponed indefinitely. In Melbourne, the fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar took three for 56 as the home side reached 203 for five in reply to the tourists' 341 at close of play on day two of the second Test between Australia and Pakistan. After his side had lost their last four wickets for only 23 runs, Akhtar removed Matthew Hayden and Ricky Ponting cheaply to keep the match in the balance. Damien Martyn, with 67, and Adam Gilchrist, on 26, stayed unbeaten for Australia. Pakistan's all-rounder Shoaib Malik did not bowl after biometric tests conducted at the University of Western Australia concluded that his off-break and \"doosra\" deliveries are illegal under International Cricket Council rules. \"We have received the report by the university and have shown it our group of bowling advisors who have also concluded Malik needs to undergo remedial work on his action before he can bowl again,\" said a Pakistan Cricket Board spokesman Abbas Zaidi. In Dhaka, India scored 348 for five in 50 overs against Bangladesh, doing something to expunge the memory of their one-day defeat on Sunday. Sourav Ganguly, Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh and Rahul Dravid scored half centuries before Bangladesh replied with 257 for nine, to lose the series 2-1."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
