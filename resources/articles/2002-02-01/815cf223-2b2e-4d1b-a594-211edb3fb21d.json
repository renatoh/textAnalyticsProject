The 21-year-old from Hampshire finished on 15-under-par, a shot clear of South Africa's Tich Moore, one of the four men with whom he shared the lead going into the last day. \"It's the first time I've won from the front like that, and I found it more difficult than making a charge,\" he said. Rose, having won his first title, the Dunhill Championship, last month, is within striking distance of the Southern African Tour of Merit leader Tim Clark."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
