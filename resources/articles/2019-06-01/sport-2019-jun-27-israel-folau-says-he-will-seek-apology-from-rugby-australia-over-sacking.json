On Friday morning Folau will attend a hearing at the Fair Work Commission regarding his unlawful termination dispute with Rugby Australia and the New South Wales Waratahs, arguing his termination amounts to unfair dismissal on religious grounds. The Instagram post in question stated hell awaits \u201cdrunks, homosexuals, adulterers, liars, fornicators, thieves, atheists and idolaters\u201d. The post was deemed a high-level breach of RA\u2019s code of conduct after previous warnings from the governing body not to denigrate people on the basis of their sexuality. Folau told Alan Jones and Peta Credlin on Sky News on Thursday night he hoped to receive an apology and an admission that RA had made an error in terminating the contract. \u201cIt starts tomorrow with the commission there,\u201d he said. \u201cI am hopeful for an apology from them, an admission they were wrong. That is something I\u2019d like to get.\u201d Folau said the words in the post \u201ccame from a place of love\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not personal,\u201d he said. \u201cJust wanting to share that message of love that God is trying to extend to all people. \u201cI can certainly see it from both sides. If I had a child that was a drug addict, I would still love that child without anything attached to that. It\u2019s something I am trying to share in love.\u201d Folau alleged that in addition to RA asking him to take the post down, the sporting body had offered money to remove it, but he said he couldn\u2019t live with that \u201cas a person convicted by my faith\u201d. RA told the Daily Telegraph that any suggestion money was offered is false. Folau was hesitant to say whether he ever saw a return to playing rugby for Australia in his future. \u201cI\u2019m extremely proud to have represented my country, it\u2019s truly an honour but tomorrow is the first step in terms of legal stuff.\u201d The rugby star has raised more than $2m through the Australian Christian Lobby as part of his legal fight with RA after a similar fundraising campaign was cancelled by GoFundMe on Monday. Jones, who told Sky News viewers that he had been in frequent contact with Folau during the controversy, described the man as a \u201cgentle Polynesian, Christian soul\u201d and said the battle was not about money but about \u201cprinciple\u201d. \u201cYou or I could be next,\u201d Jones warned, accusing Qantas and its chief executive, Alan Joyce, of \u201ccalling the shots\u201d for RA over the contract termination. \u201cThis will be a costly battle for all Australians.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
