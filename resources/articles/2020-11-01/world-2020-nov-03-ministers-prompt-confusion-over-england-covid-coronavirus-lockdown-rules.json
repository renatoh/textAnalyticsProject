Amid uncertainty over the lockdown coming into effect on Thursday, Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, issued an apology for signalling that singles tennis and golf in pairs could still go ahead. It came as Jenrick, the communities secretary, confirmed that a family could go for a walk with a friend \u2013 despite there being a two-person limit on people meeting outdoors when outside of households or support bubbles. The government\u2019s own website detailing the restrictions states that people can exercise or visit an outdoor space \u201cwhen on your own, with one person from another household\u201d, unless an exemption applies. During a question-and-answer session with constituents on Monday, Gove said: \u201cYou\u2019ll probably be able to play singles tennis at the moment. The guidance that we have is that if people are appropriately socially distanced they can take exercise with one other person \u2026 We are looking at allowing people to play on golf courses with one other appropriately distanced [person].\u201d But on Tuesday morning Gove reversed, tweeting: \u201cMy apologies, I got this wrong,\u201d and sharing a link to guidance explaining that indoor and outdoor leisure facilities including swimming pools, golf courses and riding centres would all be forced to close from Thursday. Speaking to BBC Breakfast on Tuesday, Jenrick confirmed golf and tennis would not be allowed under the new rules. \u201cThere are some differences to the national measures that we had in March and April which will benefit people. For example, you are able to do unlimited outdoor exercise during this period, so we\u2019re not going back to the time where there was only, you know, one walk a day for a limited period. \u201cYou can go out with your own household, or with your own household plus one other person and walk the dog, go for a run, go for a walk around the town or city where you live or to the countryside...\u201d Pressed to clarify his comments, host Louise Minchin said: \u201cI think I heard you say that outside you can be one household, plus one other person, is that what you meant and is that right?\u201d Jenrick replied: \u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d Suggesting a scenario that would be allowed, Minchin said: \u201cSo a family could go for a walk, with for example, a friend.\u201d Jenrick confirmed they could, saying \u201cyes\u201d. Pressed again by Minchin who asked whether it was correct it would apply to four people and one person, Jenrick appeared to contradict himself: \u201cYes, so you can go out in your own household, or with one other person.\u201d The government\u2019s website sets out the new rules warning people must not leave their home except for specific circumstances, including \u201cto exercise outdoors or visit an outdoor public place - with the people you live with, with your support bubble or, when on your own, with one person from another household (children under school age, as well as those dependent on round-the-clock care, such as those with severe disabilities, who are with their parents will not count towards the limit on two people meeting outside)\u201d. Tony Kerr, strategic development manager at National Tennis Association, said that Gove\u2019s initial remarks had given \u201ca glimmer of hope which was dashed \u2026 We don\u2019t understand the decision and it doesn\u2019t sound like the government understands the decision.\u201d \u201cNot to be able to coach even one on one, we just don\u2019t get it,\u201d he said, adding that NTA \u2013 a social enterprise aimed at expanding the number of people who play the sport \u2013 has \u201cmeasures in place that make it completely safe. Players don\u2019t even touch the ball with their hands when they\u2019re getting coaching.\u201d Hopes of a reprieve for grassroots sport during a second national lockdown were dashed by Boris Johnson on Monday. While elite sports have been given the go-ahead to continue, community sports and facilities will be forced to close. Asked in the Commons on Monday whether golf courses would be exempted from the new restrictions, the prime minister said: \u201cI must apologise to my honourable friend for not being able to offer the house a huge list of exemptions to the rules we\u2019ve set out. Because once you unpick at one thing alas the effectiveness of the whole package is compromised. \u201cThat\u2019s why I want everyone to work together for the next four weeks to get the R rate under control so that we can open things up again in time for December.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
