Sunderland argued, not without reason, that Cole had handled and Michael Gray was dismissed for dissent. Soon after this Cole and Alex Rae were sent off following an exchange of blows in the Sunderland goalmouth and ultimately only a frozen female streaker brightened Wearside's evening. This time Sunderland's has been a longer haul to a position of high esteem. Whereas last season Peter Reid's side, newly promoted from the Nationwide League, rose like rockets only to fall like sticks they now look like maintaining their challenge for a Champions League place a little longer. Not that the most optimistic Wearsider would have suspected as much last September, when after a 3-0 defeat at Old Trafford Sunderland lay in the bottom three. Before last night, however, they had lost only twice in 19 league matches and another encounter with United offered them a chance to remind the champions of just how dramatic the improvement has been. For Sunderland there was also the practical necessity of victory to leapfrog back above Arsenal into second place. Of course Reid's team had already knocked United out of the Worthington Cup this season but that night they were playing Sir Alex Ferguson's reserves. In fact the ease with which United's youngsters passed the ball around was a poor augury for Sunderland's hopes of holding the real thing. As ever they looked to Niall Quinn's power in the air complementing the goalscoring instincts of Kevin Phillips. In the fourth minute a high ball from Jody Craddock skimmed Quinn's head and fell to Phillips at the far post. His shot was off target but the most likely threat to United's defence had quickly made itself apparent. United's most recent conquerors, Liverpool in the league and West Ham in the FA Cup, had relied on outwitting them at their own passing game but Sunderland were always more likely to prefer the broadsword to the rapier. After 10 minutes Gray's low cross might have seen Sunderland score had Quinn been a fraction further forward in the goalmouth. With Don Hutchison pushing up on the right and Gavin McCann and Stefan Schwarz pressing forward to support the front men, United's early attacking pressure soon gave way to containment punctuated by quick, economical breakaways. As Giggs steadily gnawed away at the Sunderland right so United began to take the heat and passion out of the evening. The loss of Quinn with a shoulder injury on the half-hour did nothing for Sunderland's hopes of reimposing themselves. How they could have done with the suspended Danny Dichio, the usual alternative to Quinn, at that point. By half-time, with Roy Keane and Paul Scholes dominant in midfield, United were controlling the tempo and pattern of the game. Half-chances fell to Keane and Teddy Sheringham (twice) which, while they failed to produce a goal, left little doubt about which team was the more likely to score. Not that any such doubts lasted long into the second half, about half-a-minute in fact. A defensive muddle allowed Keane to send Cole clear with a short lob. Cole duly chipped the ball past Thomas Sorensen but appeared to handle it first. When Graham Poll allowed the goal to stand Sunderland's fury erupted on and off the pitch. In the end Gray protested too much and got himself needlessly sent off when Sunderland more than ever needed to be up to strength. In the event they were soon down to nine men. After 56 minutes Rae followed Gray, along with Cole, following a dust-up after the United striker had made a strong challenge on Sorensen. Three dismissals is about par for the course for Poll, who had flourished a similar number of red cards in the Arsenal-Liverpool match last August. Undaunted, Sunderland would have drawn level had Jaap Stam not got back to block a shot from Kevin Kilbane which had beaten Fabien Barthez. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
