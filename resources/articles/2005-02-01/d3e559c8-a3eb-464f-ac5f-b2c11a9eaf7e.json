Voting was 267 to 253 opposing the move, spearheaded by Labour rebels and Liberal Democrats with Conservative backing, after a stormy six-hour Commons debate. The result is a humiliating blow for the prime minister and home secretary Charles Clarke who saw the Government's 161-strong majority crumble in the face of a heavy backbench revolt over the new anti-terrorism powers. It came despite fresh concessions by Mr Clarke tonight as the government battled to get its controversial Prevention of Terrorism Bill through Parliament. Mr Clarke said he would bow to pressure to allow a judge to be the first to decide whether \"control orders\" amounting to house arrest could be imposed on a suspect. But the home secretary also announced he would be seeking to grant police \"a new and specific power\" to arrest and detain a suspect while the application to the judge was being decided. The size of the revolt signals further problems ahead for ministers in the Lords, where without further concessions, the legislation faces a severe mauling and even defeat."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
