That's a drop of 21%, with falls in people buying both CDs and digital music. This, as you'd imagine, was decidedly bad news for those in the business side of the music business. But it seems unlikely that those 24 million people have simply found better things to do with their ears. Last week, another research company revealed that some 31% of all videos watched on YouTube fall under the category of \"Music\", making it by far the most popular category. Given that YouTube now streams a billion videos per day, an awful lot of people clearly still like music. It's just that many of them \u2013 even the law-abiding ones \u2013 are beginning to realise that free, on-demand music can rather negate the impulse to spend money on it. YouTube appears well aware of this, as it's recently introduced a new discovery feature to help turn the service into a fully fledged music-streaming site (with added moving pictures). Search for a favourite artist at youtube.com/disco, and you'll get a continuous playlist of their music, alongside videos by similar acts. You can then customise, save and share your playlists. The hope is clearly to encourage users to stick around longer, and it's a job well done. Although, this being an innovation from YouTube, which is expected to generate revenue of $1.1bn in 2011, there is an advert every few songs. While YouTube now offers a decent alternative to Spotify, Spotify has this week begun a very gentle encroachment on YouTube's turf. Until Sunday, it's offering video of a live performance from Amy MacDonald to its 3 million UK users. Actually, that's not strictly true \u2013 if you're among Spotify's small band of paying Premium subscribers, you can't watch the Scottish warbler on your Spotify front page. That's because the videos qualify as an advert (implying the promotion was paid for by MacDonald's label). While Spotify obviously needs to generate revenue to continue its terrific service, you'd imagine Amy MacDonald-loving Premium subscribers might be irked. But they can, like anyone, watch the videos at spotify.com/blog. If you prefer making your own music, thounds.com is worth a look. The intuitive site lets you use your computer's mic to record a part of a song, which other users will then build upon. Or you can build upon theirs. In fact, I just laid a fierce (dreadful) rhyme over a guitar hook put together four hours ago by a Chilean named Psychedelic Disco Angels. If you have any kind of musical ability, this site could be great fun."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
