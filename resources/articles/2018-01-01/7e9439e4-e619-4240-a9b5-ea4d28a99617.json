In particular, it\u2019s the line three\u2011quarters of the way down that jumps off the page with its description of the player as a \u201cblack guy who was the butt of a lot of jokes\u201d. It is an awkward choice of words at the best of times \u2013 why mention the player\u2019s skin colour? \u2013 but particularly so bearing in mind what we know now and the fact it is referring to one of the boys who now alleges his treatment at Stamford Bridge went a long way beyond innocent humour. According to the author, that boy \u201cwas almost too nice to make it in football\u201d. The player will argue it is not a case of being too nice when there were people, two or three times his age, who were allegedly subjecting him to racial abuse. It is certainly jarring, to say the least, to hear the words that have been alleged, the claims that black players as young as 12 or 13 were treated like \u201ca race of fucking dogs\u201d and the specific allegations against Graham Rix and against Gwyn Williams, a man who gave over 25 years to Chelsea, that have left one of England\u2019s leading clubs facing civil claims from three of their old youth-team graduates. At least Chelsea, to give them their due, have recognised the seriousness of the issue and I actually have a certain amount of sympathy with the modern-day club bearing in mind, more than 20 years since the alleged events took place, it is a completely different regime at Stamford Bridge now. Their statement says they are \u201cabsolutely determined to do the right thing, fully support those affected, assist the authorities and support their investigations\u201d and the club have offered at least one of the three players in-house counselling. Chelsea, I suspect, will be mortified about what is being alleged. It should be stressed that Rix and Williams have denied the allegations, saying they are fully cooperating with the authorities and pointing out that the police had already decided not to involve the Crown Prosecution Service. There is no wish here to prejudge the civil action but it is also clear that Chelsea need to start interviewing players from the relevant era. Several have indicated they have information that would be useful and Chelsea \u2013 one of the clubs to commission a QC-led review into their involvement in the sexual-abuse scandal, investigating as far back as 1950 \u2013 have the means to instigate a proper inquiry. Yet there is also a much wider story here bearing in mind the other headlines in the last week about Peter Beardsley fighting to keep his job coaching Newcastle United Under\u201123s because of allegations \u2013 denied by Beardsley \u2013 from Yasin Ben El-Mhanni, a 22-year-old reserve, about racism and bullying. Before that, there was the racial discrimination that Eni Aluko and Drew Spence experienced during Mark Sampson\u2019s time as England Women\u2019s manager. Add in what Rhian Brewster had to say, when one of the players from England\u2019s World Cup\u2011winning under\u201117s chronicled his own experiences, and it is difficult to think of another time in football when more people have felt emboldened to speak out. That doesn\u2019t make it an easy process and it certainly wasn\u2019t pleasant for Aluko to experience the briefing against her from inside the Football Association, the victim\u2011blaming from one or two journalists and all the other nonsense she had to endure after an FA inquiry that, to recap, was summed up by the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association as a \u201csham\u201d that was \u201cnot a genuine search of the truth\u201d but \u201cdesigned to close down the complaint and absolve Mark Sampson\u201d. It cannot be much fun for El-Mhanni, either, to be a fringe player at Newcastle and taking on a man who could rival Kevin Keegan\u2019s status, as Jack Charlton once put it, for being the kind of guy who could fall into the Tyne and come out with a salmon in his mouth. Beardsley is a hero in Newcastle, one of the greatest players ever to wear those black and white stripes and, without any idea of how that case will conclude, the only thing that can be said for now is that it is terribly sad someone with his status should find himself in this position, with five other players apparently backing El-Mhanni\u2019s story. Ultimately, though, it cannot be a bad thing if football has moved into a new age, or is getting closer to it anyway, when footballers who feel they have been victimised are far more willing to come forward than they would previously. That was brought home after the interview with Brewster, when a former player, with his own experiences of enduring racism, got in touch to say how glad he was that a player of 17, still to make his professional debut for Liverpool, had felt able to come forward. In his day, he explained, black players were given the impression that it was a sign of weakness, not strength, to complain. We were talking about the 1980s, not Victorian times, but the culture was not to say anything, to suck it up and go by the mentality that if you wanted to make it in football it was something you had to go through. Herman Ouseley, the Kick it Out chairman, summed it up when he talked about how hard it once was \u2013 and still is \u2013 for many players to speak out. \u201cCertainly anyone with aspirations as a black person to play professional football has kept their heads down and tried to avoid taking on the established status quo of challenging the coach, the trainer or the football manager. They have not gone outside of that arena to try and get redress because, when they have, they have had their heads chopped off. That has been the death of their careers.\u201d It is certainly a very difficult issue. Frank Sinclair, another product of Chelsea\u2019s youth system, made the point on Twitter that \u201cwe grew up in a world of discrimination acceptance\u201d and said it was regarded as a test of character. Sinclair has sided with Rix and Williams and says the Chelsea he remembers was a tough environment where players of all shapes, nationalities and backgrounds, not just the black lads, got stick. Yet, speaking generally, it is strange if he thinks that, just because someone accepted that culture back then, they should not bring it up now, and perhaps he would take a more sympathetic view if he had seen the evidence from one player about how the alleged abuse \u2013 including, he says, physical attacks from Rix and one incident when a cup of hot coffee was thrown in his face \u2013 had affected his life, stripped his confidence and, at times, left him wondering if he has the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Perhaps Sinclair, who did not play in the same team, might understand that, by questioning that player\u2019s version of events, he is showing again \u2013 even unintentionally \u2013 why people in that position feel reticent about coming forward because of the backlash. And there is, always, a backlash, as Aluko, Patrice Evra and many others, most recently Mason Holgate, can all testify. New procedures have just been announced for whistle-blowing and that at least is a start if the FA wants to repair some of the damage caused by the Aluko affair. Yet that raises other issues, if you recall Greg Clarke\u2019s mea culpa last October when the FA chairman admitted it had \u201cfailed\u201d, lost the trust of the public and been exposed for \u201chow out of step we are\u201d. Clarke might have apologised for his description of institutional racism as \u201cfluff\u201d but that will probably always be the comment that defines his time in office. As for the rest of the organisation, the FA\u2019s own polls show that only 27% of football fans think it is a competent governing body. Even fewer, 24%, have a positive perception of the organisation and I\u2019m not confident those numbers will be improved by the explanation why Dan Ashworth, the FA\u2019s technical director, has quietly been taken off England Women duties. Martin Glenn, the chief executive, would like us to believe it has nothing to do with Ashworth\u2019s handling of the Aluko inquiry. And pigs might fly. Maybe one day it will be different and the FA will no longer inspire this kind of suspicion. I doubt, however, that will be with this regime and that, in a nutshell, is the problem when it comes to encouraging people to trust the authorities. The damage is done and it feels very contradictory at a time when more and more players have decided that, no, they aren\u2019t going to stay in that world of acceptance any longer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
