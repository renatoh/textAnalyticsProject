Chin\u2019ono was rearrested at his home in the capital, Harare, on Tuesday evening for allegedly breaking his bail conditions and has been detained since. The respected documentary-maker was first arrested in July after publishing a series of investigations into corruption by senior public officials in Zimbabwe. He was held in an overcrowded cell in Chikurubi high-security prison for almost six weeks pending trial on charges of inciting violence. On his release in September, Chin\u2019ono was effectively banned from using social media for anything that could be seen as critical of the Zanu-PF government. He did, however, give a series of media interviews in which he described the horrific conditions he faced in prison. Beatrice Mtwetwa, Zimbabwe\u2019s best-known human rights lawyer, told the court on Friday that Chin\u2019ono, who has not yet faced trial, was being detained with convicted prisoners and had been held for more than 48 hours before being brought to court. He was brought to court just before the end of the day on Thursday, which his lawyers said was a deliberate tactic to delay proceedings. The new charge is related to comments Chin\u2019ono made about possessing classified information from the national prosecuting authority relating to Henrietta Rushwaya, the president of the Zimbabwe Miners\u2019 Federation, who was arrested last week at Harare\u2019s airport and has been charged with attempting to smuggle gold to Dubai. According to court papers, Chin\u2019ono \u201cclaims to be engaged in a relationship with the national prosecution authority thereby jeopardising the integrity of the case against himself and that of Henrietta Rushwaya.\u201d Rushwaya has denied any wrongdoing. Chin\u2019ono, who denies the new charge against him, was brought to court in leg irons. The EU\u2019s office in Zimbabwe expressed concern over his rearrest and detention. \u201cHopewell Chin\u2019ono\u2019s detention sends a chilling signal on freedom of opinion and expression in Zimbabwe. Exposing corruption is not a crime, the fight against corruption is a declared government priority,\u201d it said on Twitter. The British ambassador to Zimbabwe, Melanie Robinson, said Chin\u2019ono had \u201cconsistently spoken out about corruption in Zimbabwe\u201d and expressed concerns \u201cabout the signals the case against him sends to journalists here\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
