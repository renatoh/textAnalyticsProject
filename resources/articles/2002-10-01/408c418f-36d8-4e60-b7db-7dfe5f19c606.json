Thousands will queue in the rain at the prospect of auditioning for stardom, but there seems to be no crash that rings louder than a falling reputation. These days falling stars are not put in the pocket; they are blazoned over the media. What we seem to dislike most is being hoodwinked, and it seems that the judges are now catching on. Last week was a bad one for Naomi Campbell. The court of appeal handed down two judgments against her. The first, and better known, was the rejection of her damages claim against the Mirror for publishing a story and pictures of her attending a drugs self-help group. The key fact in the case was the finding of the first instance judge that Campbell had earlier lied when denying drug addiction. The process turned an initial damages award in her favour for \u00a33,500 into an order on appeal to pay the Mirror's legal costs, estimated at \u00a3350,000. We judge many celebrity cases on two levels. One is the instinctive, social judgment, often characterised by the words \"they shouldn't be allowed to get away with that\". Media personalities are, to some extent, manufactured, and, while playing our part in the process, we seem happy to dismantle the product. The other is the legal reasoning, which has both to resolve the case in accordance with established principles and to set clear guidance for the future. There were three main legal planks to the Campbell argument against the Mirror; confidentiality, privacy and data protection. Each comes from a different source. The law of confidentiality is a long standing part of our common law which seeks to protect ideas and actions communi cated in confidence. The second, personal privacy, is a co-product of centuries of international human rights gestation culminating in our Human Rights Act 1998, which adopts the European Human Rights Convention. It is worth noting that article 8 gives the \"right of respect for private and family life\" - not a right to \"privacy\" as such. The third plank is of more recent origins, formulated in the Data Protection Act, also of 1998. Section 2 of this act particularly recognises the need for greater protection of what is characterised as \"sensitive personal data\", a category that includes information relating to a person's physical or mental health or condition, and thus drug addiction and its treatment. On the other side of the contest are freedom of expression and public interest, long seen and underpinned as an essential bulwark of democracy. The three stumps of the Campbell case were clean bowled in the court of appeal by a straight delivery of public interest. The court held that the Mirror's report and photographs were \"a legitimate, if not an essential, part of ... [demonstrating] that Ms Campbell had been deceiving the public when she said that she did not take drugs\". The law of confidence, said the court, could not be used as a defence to prevent the record being put straight where a public figure chooses to tell untruths. The Data Protection Act also contains an express public interest exemption, which the court decided applied pre- and post-publication. Finally, and heralded by some of those who have not always been its champions, the self-regulation of the press complaints commission (PCC) was seen to be exonerated in the process. Order seems to be restored. But the judge at the previous hearing appears to have been influenced by the fact that the photographs in question were obtained surreptitiously, in apparent breach of data protection principles and the PCC code of practice. Moreover, Campbell should not be discouraged from owning up to and seeking treatment for her addiction. Campbell received a second blow from the same appeal court judges in her case against her former PA. Vanessa Frisbee had entered into a formal confidentiality agreement with Campbell. When the relationship went sour, Frisbee sold her story of Campbell's alleged affair with a famous actor to a newspaper. Frisbee claimed that Campbell's conduct towards her had been so extreme as to amount to a repudiation of their contract and, following precedents in relation to employment law, freed her from her duties of confidentiality. The trial judge disagreed; he gave Campbell summary judgment but was in turn overruled by the court of appeal. One major difference in this case is that the appeal was against a summary judgment; the overall case itself has still not been decided. Unsurprisingly, in the light of Campbell round one, the appeal court ruled that confidentiality could not be absolute where public interest issues were concerned. So where does this leave us? First, it seems that obligations of confidentiality are now clearly subject to the public interest test, and confidentiality obligations cannot be used to beef up privacy or data protection rights where there is genuine public interest at stake. Second, while being famous does not justify intrusion into private lives, public dishonesty will lower the drawbridge, especially where, as here, the subjects go out of their way to deny the allegations. The media response must still be measured and limited to what is appropriate to put the record straight, but it will now be a very rich and bold star who will be willing to take on the press where there is clear evidence of an untruth. Third, the case seems not to enhance and possibly to shrink the likely ambit of \"privacy\" rights under the Human Rights Act. \u00b7 Charles Boundy is a partner at Fladgate Fielder."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
