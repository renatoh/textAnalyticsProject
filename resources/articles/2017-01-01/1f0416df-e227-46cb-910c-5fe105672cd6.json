They will never take my spirit\u2019", "bodyText": "\u201cI never thought I\u2019d hear myself say this, but maybe there will be an I\u2019m a Celebrity in me soon,\u201d says Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan with a breezy cheeriness at odds with the drab January day outside the industrial estate in Essex where he practises. \u201cI\u2019ve spent so many years saying no to everything, but if the price is right and it\u2019s a nice trip \u2026\u201d His voice trails off, but it quickly becomes clear that the prospect of chomping down on sheep\u2019s testicles wouldn\u2019t put him off. \u201cI had bull\u2019s cock in China,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt was quite nice. Best thing on the plate. And I\u2019d be all right psychologically too, as Steve Peters would help. It\u2019s a few weeks in the jungle, you\u2019re having a laugh. Some people in this country are living on food stamp, they don\u2019t know where their next meal\u2019s coming from.\u201d Welcome to Ronnie 2.0: traveller, raconteur, intensely political and pushing at fresh boundaries \u2013 and liking what he is finding. They say that life begins at 40. O\u2019Sullivan is living proof. \u201cI was just unhappy before,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t know anything else beyond potting balls. I was scared to break out\u201d. But now, aged 41, he is doing so with a vengeance. Last year he was on the road for four months straight, travelling to China to coach and play the odd game of snooker, and to the US to film Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s American Hustle, a four-episode travelogue in which he discovers the history of pool, which will be shown on British TV this month. He\u2019s also doing punditry for Eurosport, and has even taken up boxing. \u201cJust with a few old boys,\u201d he says. \u201cNo one takes it too seriously. I wouldn\u2019t get in there with a psychopath. I just do it for the fitness.\u201d However, before his opening round match against Liang Wenbo in the Masters on Sunday he has a confession. \u201cI took Christmas off which I never normally do,\u201d he says. \u201cI spent 10 days in bed, watching TV, some darts, loads of Netflix. I had a great time. Just chilled out. I haven\u2019t really done a lot of practice but I will try my nuts off against Liang and if I win I\u2019ll have four more days to prepare and maybe my game will come.\u201d O\u2019Sullivan, the defending Masters champion, knows he will be roared on by the sell-out 2,000 crowd at Alexandra Palace. And it is clear that he hugely appreciates being regarded as a working-class hero. But increasingly, he finds that he wants to do more: he wants to speak out at what he feels are the widening injustices in society. \u201cI just think: \u2018How bad is it when the world is brought to its knees and not one person got punished for it?\u2019 There\u2019s no jobs. No jobs in this country or America. There\u2019s a lot of people on food stamps over there. Meanwhile, the boss of Walmart gets a $20m salary or whatever it is. It\u2019s just wrong. There\u2019s too much of a divide. People can\u2019t afford to fill their fridge, never mind buy their son a pair of trainers. It\u2019s sad. People just want, want, want, take, take, take. \u201cWe are all human beings, we all have a purpose in life, we all want to enjoy this time on the planet, there is enough in the world for everyone in the world to have the basic needs without feeling under depression. I believe a lot of our illnesses and struggles and suicides and drug addictions and whatever is brought on by hopelessness.\u201d O\u2019Sullivan is warming to his theme now. \u201cI come from a working class background. My parents worked hard and got up the ladder. In the 80s you could do that. But since they took away the unions and people power, people are fucked, basically. They have nowhere to go. The more you crush someone, the less hope they\u2019ve got. They become numbed-down and they give up. People give up, that\u2019s what happens. You kill them so much that they think \u2018Fuck this, we can\u2019t win.\u2019\u201d O\u2019Sullivan talks about how much he admires Ed Miliband and talks fondly of going up with him to visit his Doncaster constituency and hanging about with \u201cproper, working-class people\u201d. \u201cI can\u2019t relate to a bunch of bankers sitting there, fucking drinking wine and splashing money like it\u2019s going out of fashion,\u201d he confesses. \u201cIt\u2019s obscene, it makes me feel sick. I don\u2019t like being around that kind of behaviour. It makes me feel disgusted.\u201d He sees similar injustices going on in the game of snooker. For despite there being more tournaments, those who get knocked out in the early rounds now struggle to make any sort of living. \u201cI\u2019m not going to support a system that doesn\u2019t benefit the bottom-ranked players,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s no trickle down. All the top players get everything and those at the bottom are in poverty, keeping them in debt. \u201cSnooker, unfortunately, isn\u2019t like golf, football and tennis where the bottom players can be sustained. In snooker, a lot of players can\u2019t afford a pair of trainers for their kid, they can\u2019t afford to buy the train ticket for a tournament. They can\u2019t afford the hotel room. They are waiting for someone to lose and then ask for your hotel room. How is that right? How can that be right for a good snooker player who has devoted all his life? Then you see board members flying business class, drinking red wine, schmoozing, wearing nice suits, saying they are doing wonderful things for the game and it\u2019s never been in a better place.\u201d O\u2019Sullivan cites the case of the Irish player Fergal O\u2019Brien, a tournament winner who he says he is struggling to stay on the tour. He believes a player ranked 32 in the world would be on \u00a330,000 a year, after paying tax and their expenses. \u201cIt\u2019s not bad but those between 33-128 in the world are not making a good living.\u201d O\u2019Sullivan clearly has little time for World Snooker but says he won\u2019t antagonise \u201cthe people who run things\u201d because \u201cthey are looking for any little excuse to throw the book at you.\u201d To make sure he does not have to deal with them directly, O\u2019Sullivan now employs someone to handle all his dealings with the game\u2019s governing body. \u201cI\u2019ve told them you are not allowed to email me. You have to go through someone else and we will keep it professional and keep that distance. I ain\u2019t going to accept the bullshit. I can\u2019t help it \u2013 if I smell something I say it\u2019s bullshit.\u201d \u201cI know how they try to bring certain people down, but they will never take my soul. They will never take my spirit. I just won\u2019t have it. My favourite film was Braveheart and as a character he signalled everything to me, which was freedom. We all should have freedom and that\u2019s what I believe in and no one is going to take my freedom.\u201d When young players tell him they want to become snooker players, how does he respond? \u201cI tell them no every time,\u201d he replies, shaking his head. \u201cIf my son \u2013 who turns 10 in June \u2013 chooses to play snooker, I\u2019ve told him he won\u2019t get support. That\u2019s the deal. If you want to be in motor racing or tennis, or you want to be a doctor or lawyer or want to go and study, whatever, you get my support. But anything with snooker, I\u2019m going to have to tell you that you are on your own.\u201d O\u2019Sullivan recently watched the documentary I am Bolt, and expresses his deep admiration for Tiger Woods in our interview. But when asked whether he is in their bracket, as a naturally gifted sporting genius, he hesitates. \u201cI just do my best,\u201d he replies. \u201cI know I can perform to a high level and when I don\u2019t, I\u2019m prepared to tough it out more than I was before. I love to compete.\u201d As our hour talking comes to an end O\u2019Sullivan is still chewing the fat, despite having been up until 2.30am the previous night playing in an Ireland versus England legends exhibition match and having had to get up at 6am to get the flight back from County Kildare. He seems in a good place. \u201cSnooker\u2019s the bit I don\u2019t really like,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut since doing all this other stuff, I started coming out of myself. I\u2019m a lot happier. I thought, \u2018I want to be happy now. I want to have a laugh. I don\u2019t want the grind, the treadmill.\u2019 And I\u2019m having an absolute ball.\u201d This article was amended on 16 January 2017 to correct the name of O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s travelogue."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
