A dress that I made myself and a jacket by Karl Lagerfeld. Also a Vivienne Westwood pin and a vintage Christian Dior pin that I took from my mother. I have a tendency to adopt things of hers, then if I wear them long enough she thinks they are mine anyway. My shoes are Charles Nolan - I bought them in New York, where I live - and my socks were a value pack from a kids' store. I made this shirt into a tuxedo shirt from a regular shirt - now it has tails. I have a lot of high-waisted pants and I hate stuffing shirts in, and I like having tails out, so it's completely functional. Your bowtie isn't so functional though. It's fashionably functional. It was my father's - he is 68 and used to go to a lot of black-tie events but he obviously didn't know how to tie them because this is a clip on. Describe your style. I dress based on mood. I'll have an image in my head. Today I wanted to look like a 20s portrait - like a doll. What about your colourful bag? This is the only one I brought over from New York because I had to conserve space. It's my happy 60s bag by Lulu Guinness - it goes with everything. The umbrella is from a drugstore, or pharmacy as you would say. Do you spend a lot of time and energy shopping? Yes, it's a disease. Right now I'm trying to spend more time playing with my own things - redesigning them. When I shop I'll be looking for something specific to complete a look that I have in my head, so I hate it when stores are pushy because I'm already in the zone. Is this an everyday look for you? Yes, but it changes a lot. Every time my hair gets long enough for me to change it, it gets cut. I've had every colour and every cut but right now, since I'm modelling, I have to keep it consistent. Is there anyone whose dress sense you admire? Not really. I think Audrey Hepburn is completely glamorous, but now you can't have any American style icons because they're all styled by someone else, so I'd be paying homage to the wrong person. Do you apply those huge false eyelashes every day? No, it's just for this look. I'm scared of applying them every day because there was a time when I did but the adhesive stuck so well that it pulled out a few of my own eyelashes. That visual freaked me out, so I had to take a break for a few weeks. But I'm back on the wagon now. Does this outfit give out any clues about your personality? I think it does. It's a hybrid that shows the different levels of my personality. It's a little girl's dress but in adult proportions, with a man's tailoring aspect to it, and then with showgirl eyelashes. What's the most expensive item of clothing you've ever bought? An Issey Miyake dress that was $1,600 (\u00a3810). The truth behind the dress - as degrading as it may be - is that I had lunch with my friend and we had a bottle of wine between us. Never go shopping drunk. It's a fantastic piece, though, and I think of it as an art piece - there were only four dresses made like it. But I never told my mom what I'd really spent on it. I lied and said that I found it for, like, $400. I've worn it a lot of different ways and quite a few times, but I feel like some places don't deserve to see that piece. You have to be really worthy for me to bring out my Issey Miyake dress."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
