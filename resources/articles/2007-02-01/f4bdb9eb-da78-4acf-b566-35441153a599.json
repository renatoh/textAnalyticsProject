The Sheffield-based training and skills provider, A4e, works as a contractor for Jobcentre Plus, which helps the long-term unemployed to get off benefits and into work or training. In 2005, the company won a bid for a two-year pilot scheme to set up and run Israel's first welfare-to-work programme, to provide training and job opportunities for the long-term unemployed in Jerusalem. The pilot provided training for more than 8,000 people, secured 3,000 jobs, and was even praised by former Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who described the UK as a world leader in achieving economic success through social change via welfare-to-work schemes. \"Israel has a chance to learn from the UK, and hopefully catch up,\" he said. In partnership with Israeli-based firm Aman, A4e has won the contract to roll out the UK model across Israel, including politically sensitive East Jerusalem, where it will benefit jobless Palestinians. The fact that the deal meant that an Israeli-financed scheme was working in a mainly Palestinian area drew hostile reactions, with media allegations that the British government, and A4e, were profiting from the Israeli occupation. It is understood that A4e had talks with the Palestine Liberation Organisation and involved prominent Palestinians in its work to provide reassurance that A4e's motives were simply to provide opportunities for anyone who needed help Mark Lovell, A4e chief executive, says that the long-term unemployment problems of Jerusalem are similar to those in Sheffield and, as a result, A4e's work in both cities focuses on high unemployment, high welfare costs, diverse populations, and high incidences of poverty amid declining industries. \"You had areas where people said there are no jobs, when that's not really the case,\" Lovell says. \"It's about access to the jobs - and that is what we provide.\" According to Lovell, the pilot's success was based on the fact that it recruited local staff from the wide cross-section of ethnic and nationality groups in Israel. \"We don't just parachute in solutions,\" he stresses. \"We customise services and engage with clients, so then we can enable the local community to provide solutions.\" Examples include providing basic Hebrew for jobseekers from Ethiopia or Russia. \"They may be highly qualified in their own countries, but the qualifications may not be immediately transferable,\" Lovell says. \"Or it may be that the job may be very technical and requires very little in terms of language skills, but the candidates don't have the language to get past the interview.\" In the initial bidding stage, A4e was up against one US and two Dutch companies that were more focused on cutting benefit fraud and reducing government spending on welfare and unemployment. \"There was a lot of hostility to this sort of approach,\" Lovell says. \"One firm that had its office in Nazareth was firebombed.\" As the scheme is rolled out, it will provide specific services for unemployed Arabs. \"People need to understand that we don't get involved in the high-level politics,\" Lovell says. \"We believe in equal access to opportunities for everybody.\" The UK model is also about to be deployed in Gelsenkirchen, in Germany, and Choisy-le-Roi and Cr\u00e9teil, two of the banlieues on the outskirts of Paris that are blighted by unemployment and social problems. Lovell says: \"It's nice to know that the UK has some good stories to tell and good things to export.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
