By the time Mr Buck returned to his home town more than 20 years later to take up his current job at the coat maker at the age of 42, things had changed: \"The town was totally unrecognisable.\" As Bank of England governor Mervyn King and the monetary policy committee visit the north-east this week, they will not see the dark and dangerous Gateshead of Mr Buck's youth but the gleaming curves of the Sage centre and the white, half-moon millennium bridge. The Baltic arts centre is the town's most visible symbol of regeneration. In its heyday Newcastle had thriving shipyards, textile industry and mines. At five o'clock in the evening Barbour's clothing factory in South Shields is filled with the buzz of sewing machines as the company's employees work overtime to fill an order. But this is unusual in Newcastle: most manufacturing industries have either closed or dramatically downsized. The town has had to reinvent itself to survive. The arts centre and a thriving bar and nightlife scene have made Newcastle a popular destination for city breaks, creating service sector jobs to replace many of those lost manufacturing jobs. There are other success stories. The town is home to the only bank headquarters outside of the south-east and Scotland. When Northern Rock floated in 1997, many expected it to be taken over. But its focus on providing mortgages has proved successful, with the company's share price rising by 74% since flotation. At its base in Gosforth, the company employs about 4,500 people. Chris Jobe, the bank's north-east director, said: \"We will soon be opening a purpose-built site in Sunderland where we will be employing another 1,000 people by 2008.\" Newcastle is home to another FTSE company, the IT group Sage. Paul Rubinstein, head of economic and cultural affairs at Newcastle city council, sees science and technology as the future for the city. There is a new Life Science Centre with scientists carrying out cutting-edge stem cell research. Mr Rubinstein's vision is for a combination of research scientists from the city's universities and private funding creating science firms based on redeveloped brownfield sites and staffed by Newcastle's brightest graduates. But the academic success of the region's pupils needs to improve. \"Our children do well in primary school but between the ages of 11 and 14, the success falls away and we don't know why,\" says Mr Rubinstein. This problem is acute in Scotswood. Perched on a hill above Newcastle, the streets are bleak with many empty houses, metal plates replacing windows, waiting to be demolished. Shops are boarded up and the streets are quiet. \"Our biggest challenge is to ensure that the bright kid growing up in Scotswood who enjoys maths goes on to university and can a see a future staying in Newcastle,\" says Mr Rubinstein. Scotswood will be the site of a new city academy donated by the philanthropist Irvine Laidlaw. The council hopes to redevelop the suburb. But Andy Gibson of the Scotswood support centre says there is no magic wand. \"It's a long, hard grind to persuade kids that there is value in education. Everyone is looking around for snake oil but it will involve a lot of hard work with the young people.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
