No, a \u00a338 Marks &amp; Spencer number, actually. I'd like to assess the difference for myself. Is there a pictorial record of this pulchritudinous player's strange sartorial decision? Yes, in a number of our national newspapers, thanks to a photographer who happened across the sight on the beach near Sharapova's Florida home. So why didn't a woman who's just won \u00a3560,000 at Wimbledon splash out on a designer swimsuit? Hard to say. Possibly she still considers herself primarily a sportswoman and inclines to a bikini that can withstand greater exertions than snogging the nearest permatanned Z-list freak. Or perhaps she labours under the apparently ineradicable delusion among foreigners that M&amp;S is the last word in British chic and is unaware that such swimsuits are traditionally worn by women like me, whose thighs have separate postcodes. Still, Stuart Rose must be pleased with the exposure. As it were. He hasn't commented, but one imagines it's been a brief ray of sunshine in his otherwise bleak existence. All he needs to do now is persuade us to buy eight million of the things. Perhaps Rose could persuade Sharapova to become the face of M&amp;S? She could sit on the beach in an elasticated skirt, eating some really well-thought-out ready meals and saying, \"Well, you get what you pay for, don't you?\" Or they could show her wandering round a store in a welter of confusion, searching desperately for a shop assistant and muttering, \"Would it kill them to put some bloody signs up?\" Exactly. Unfortunately, rumour has it that Louis Vuitton are about to sign her. She's going to model luggage? They do clothes too, you fashion philistine. Not to be confused with: The Kournikova bra, the Molotov cocktail, the Romanov dynasty."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
