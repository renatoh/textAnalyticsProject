This showcase of repertory, takes its title from the Sanskrit word Sri \u2013 \"the divine female principle\". In Aakriti, abstract dance and solo voice wind an intricate pattern of sound and movement that evokes the rich detail of temple sculpture. This is followed by Srimayi, an intimate work inspired by romantic poetry of the 12th century. Vibhakta is another duet for singer and dancer, in which the two performers engage in a love song that is also a celebration of the unity of mind and body, reality and illusion. All three works are choreographed by Surupa Sen, with Pandit Raghunath as the principal composer. King's Theatre, Fri to 29 Aug Scottish Ballet Double Bill Jorma Elo, resident choreographer of Boston Ballet is one of the most sought-after contemporary dance makers on the international circuit, but \u2013 in what seems to be an incredible oversight \u2013 his fractured, high-powered choreography is still getting only sporadic exposure in the UK. Scottish Ballet, with its finger on the pulse as usual, has commissioned a new ballet from Elo, set to music by Mozart and Steve Reich. Completing the programme is Kenneth MacMillan's 1965 balllet Song Of The Earth, arguably his greatest work, its expressive, austere choreography and its evocation of life, death and renewal inspired by Mahler's sublime song cycle, Das Lied von der Erde. The music is played by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra (under Sian Edwards) with mezzo-soprano Katarina Karn\u00e9us and tenor Peter Wedd. Edinburgh Playhouse, Fri to 28 Aug Protein Dance: LOL (lots of love) Luca Silvestrini is at his comic, imaginative best in this satire on love and the age of social networking, which has its Edinburgh premiere at this year's festival fringe. Telling the stories of those who search for romance, friendship or just plain human contact in the worlds of Twitter, Facebook and online dating sites, this fine piece of dance-theatre is both wickedly accurate and tenderly humane, justifying both interpretations of LOL: \"laugh out loud\" and \"lots of love\". The cast of six dancers, headed by the ever remarkable Sally Marie, are superb and the work comes with an intelligently composed original sound score by Andy Pink, with video animation by Rachel Davies to complete the colourful show.
