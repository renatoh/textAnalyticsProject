Why are they doing this, they wondered on Wednesday after health's new boy, Alan Johnson, unveiled a review of the embattled NHS. \"Because they've run out of ideas,\" the Tories told each other. Yesterday's English university student grants offering from John Denham, the Iraq war refusnik returned to government as innovation, universities and skills secretary, was more generously received. Most politicians like the idea of expanding university access to low-income families with smart kids who would benefit. The economy needs them too. So they queued up to applaud what looks like a very modest gesture towards greater social mobility, something they know has slipped back since most of them were young. There was scepticism, but not too much. Labour MPs who gritted their teeth voting for (or against) Tony Blair's top-up fees bill in 2003-04 felt a wrong had been partially righted. Certainly there were useful proposals in the Denham statement: guaranteed support in years 12 and 13 and university for youngsters from low-income families; more mentors for those whose parents did not get a degree; a \"loan repayment break\" for graduates buying a home or starting a family themselves. And yet, doubts persist that overall this might not be the best way to spend the notional \u00a3400m being allocated for better maintenance grants for families with incomes up to a solid \u00a360,000 a year, benefiting up to 250,000 students, but means-tested. The Tory spokesman, David Willetts, will not be alone in asking what may be cut to pay for it. Nothing, he was assured, though it is not new money, merely unallocated money. In fact, contrary to hysteria all round during debates on the 2004 Higher Education Act and fears that fees would discourage them, the number of poorer children attending university has remained stubbornly around the 28% mark. What the massive increase in numbers since 1997 - 400,000 including overseas customers, Mr Denham told MPs - has confirmed is a trend dating from the 1980s: extra capacity has been soaked up by middle-class daughters. Mr Denham has a review of the student fees system in the pipeline. But if he wants to help the poorest he might look again at yesterday's Cinderellas - part-time students."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
