The tremendous response of fire crews from Hertfordshire and the other 31 other brigades which gave assistance has been rightly praised. In the days immediately following Buncefield, the Hertfordshire emergency fire control and those fire crews not at the Buncefield site responded to hundreds of other 999 emergencies. At a Downing Street reception held in their honour Tony Blair said there were \"no finer set of public services and public servants in the world\". What is now happening to these fine sets of public servants is a scandal which goes beyond even the familiar hypocrisy of some politicians. All of the stations which were the first to respond to Buncefield are facing the loss of frontline firefighters. Two of those stations - Radlett and Bovingdon - are facing closure and the 23 retained firefighters at them facing redundancy. More than 40 frontline firefighter posts will be lost. Hertfordshire's modern emergency fire-control room, which played a magnificent part in dealing with the initial response to Buncefield, is to be closed in the next two years and the control room firefighters made redundant. There are plans for a remote regional centre based near Cambridge to handle all of the 999 calls to six separate fire and rescue services in the east of England, including Hertfordshire. Despite the government having a truly appalling track record of managing such major projects they want to press ahead. It is the next IT disaster. Perhaps Ruth Kelly, the new cabinet minister, can look again at what her predecessor, John Prescott, started, halt the cuts to fire services and stop the closures of our fantastic emergency fire-control rooms.
