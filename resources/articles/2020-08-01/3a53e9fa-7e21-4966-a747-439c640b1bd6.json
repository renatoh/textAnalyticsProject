And that really does begin and end with brilliant sound. Here\u2019s how to best replicate a movie moment that was captured in a recording studio at home. Greg McAllister, sound experience manager for Sonos, smiles as he remembers the day that one of the scores from the 2014 movie Maleficent was recorded inside the famous Abbey Road Studios in London. \u201cThere\u2019s this really lovely score that accompanies the scene where [Angelina Jolie] is seen flying around,\u201d McAllister says. \u201cWhenever I hear it, it takes me back to working on it.\u201d Greg McAllister, sound experience manager for Sonos. Composed by James Newton Howard and titled Maleficent Flies, the score commands the depth and power of a large orchestra. Fluttering woodwinds, twinkling chimes and rich brasses are set against the sinister heroine swiftly soaring over the moors - a mossy and lush wonderland populated by mythical creatures. \u201cThere would be times where I would go and stand in the room with the orchestra,\u201d McAllister says. \u201cI\u2019d be literally one metre away and the amount of air that they were moving and the amount of sound that was being generated was just colossal. You could feel it. \u201cThe entire piece is just one big crescendo. It gradually gets louder and louder and builds and builds until the final moment where there\u2019s horns, a big string swell and a gran cassa bass drum, which is a huge percussion instrument that is taller than me. It all comes to this climax at the end.\u201d Take a look at this Maleficent Flies scene. Now compare it to Disney\u2019s clip from the film where the beginning of the score is omitted, or to the soundtrack capture. The inclusion of the gran cassa drum is both deliberate and important. Howard has purposefully added the instrument into the score at this exact moment to brilliantly capture a feeling of triumph and power. The cinemagoer absorbs this sound as they watch Maleficent show off her giant wing span - and those distinctly Jolie cheekbones - a winning combo that depicts her as the strongest of the fairies and the protector of the moors. Sadly, however, a lot of people won\u2019t hear this entire score because of the quality of their television speakers. In fact, as McAllister tells it, if you\u2019re watching a movie with a bad sound system, the speaker will actually omit certain sounds, whether they be \u201cthe low kind of rumbles and sub-elements or the really high frequencies\u201d, McAllister says. \u201cIf you were listening on a TV speaker or a poor quality speaker, you\u2019re going to get a narrower frequency band with limited dynamics. That crescendo - you\u2019re not going to hear that. You\u2019re not going to hear the gran cassa bass drum and you\u2019re not going to get the harmonics of the strings or the really high-frequency registers. \u201cSo the whole experience is kind of dulled down, it\u2019s just kind of muted. If you are to watch a film with a great sounding speaker, then suddenly you have this huge crescendo and really rumbling bass drum and it\u2019s very easy to see the difference in an emotional reaction. It\u2019s so much more immersive. It\u2019s much easier to lose yourself in it and it\u2019s much more representative of you actually being there.\u201d Award-winning Australian film composer and multi-instrumentalist Damien Lane will sit down with directors and editors on a film and go through scene after scene to identify where music should come in and what function it should serve. He likens the experience of watching a movie on a laptop or with a bad television speaker to \u201cgoing to an art gallery and wearing sunglasses\u201d. \u201cThe vibrancy of the colours is not going to be really available to you,\u201d says Lane, who recently worked on an ABC documentary about Australian artist Ben Quilty. \u201cWhen I\u2019m composing a film score, I\u2019m looking for the subtext. Film music can communicate things that are not written into the script or delivered with the performances of the actors or shown by the cinematography or communicated with sound effects. There might be some sort of ambiguous emotion that the music can contribute. \u201cThese projects have been created with an incredible attention to detail. This isn\u2019t to say you can\u2019t be engaged in a story by watching it on a laptop, but you\u2019re basically not getting the full picture.\u201d McAllister says: \u201cIt\u2019s about getting you closer to what it would be like in real life if you were stood there in front of the orchestra, like I so fortunately was that day.\u201d Pass the popcorn. Listen to movies your way with Sonos."}, "isHosted": false}}}
