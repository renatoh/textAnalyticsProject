Having already beaten the Gunners in February's League Cup final, Marley believes Everton are set to challenge the near-total domination of a team that despite yesterday's setback are almost certain to carry off a seventh league title in eight years. \"We've added maturity and composure to our passion and drive,\" said Marley, \"And that's been crucial in the way we've improved to the point where we can match the best team in the country. For a while I've been telling my team they can be great but it's only now that their starting to believe it themselves. If they carry on believing then we can be the team of the future.\" The future may look bright for Everton but not for Cardiff City, who were relegated without kicking a ball over the weekend. Birmingham City's 4-0 win at Charlton Athletic ensured the Blues' survival but condemned Cardiff along with the already doomed Addicks. Elsewhere, Chelsea scored a 2-1 victory at Blackburn Rovers, and Leeds United won 1-0 against the visiting Bristol Academy The battle to replace the two relegated clubs is set for a thrilling finale in the league's two regional divisions. In the north, Lincoln City went to the top top on goal difference from Nottingham Forest with a 4-0 victory over Aston Villa. Whether it is the Imps or Forest who move up will be decided next week, when each play their last matches of the campaign. In the south, the leaders, Fulham, and the team second in the table, Barnet, drew their games to leave Fulham requiring four points from their final two fixtures to reclaim the place they lost in the top division last season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
