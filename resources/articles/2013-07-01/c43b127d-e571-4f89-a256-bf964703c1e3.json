Serves 4 600g white fish For the mayonnaise 1 egg yolk \u00bd garlic clove, crushed \u00bd tsp English mustard powder 105ml vegetable oil 1 tsp white wine vinegar 1 tsp lemon juice 1 tsp chives, chopped Salt and black pepper For the coating 70g puffed rice 3 tsp sesame seeds 2 eggs 3 tbsp plain flour \u00bd tsp smoked paprika 3 tbsp sunflower oil Black pepper 1 For the mayonnaise, combine the egg yolk, crushed garlic, mustard powder and a pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl and whisk. Pour the oil into a jug and, while whisking the egg mix, gradually add a drop or two to the bowl. Slowly add more oil, until the mix starts to thicken and emulsify, then add the white wine vinegar and whisk. Add the rest of the oil very gradually, until it is all incorporated and the sauce resembles a mayonnaise. Mix in the lemon juice and chopped chives and set aside. 2 Cut the fish into finger-size portions and set aside. Add the sesame seeds and puffed rice to a bowl and crush to a fine powder with your hands, but keep some puffed rice whole. 3 In a separate bowl, beat the eggs to make a wash. In another bowl, season the flour with paprika and black pepper and place the fish fingers into it one at a time, coating them on all sides. Shake gently to remove any excess flour. Next, dip them into the beaten eggs, then coat them in the crushed puffed rice and sesame seed mix. Repeat until each piece of fish is coated. 4 Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat. Once hot, add the fish fingers in batches and fry for 1\u00bd to 2 minutes on each side, or until golden and cooked through. 5 Remove the fish from the pan and place on a plate covered with kitchen roll to absorb any excess oil. Serve with the tangy mayonnaise dip. Recipe by Marcello Tully, greatbritishchefs.com Sticky toffee pudding in a jar You'll need four 250ml ovenproof jars to make these heavenly little puddings. If you can't find muscovado, you could simply substitute soft brown sugar. Serves 4 100g pitted dates \u00bd tsp bicarbonate of soda 25g softened butter, plus extra for greasing 30g soft brown sugar 30g dark muscovado sugar 1 egg 1 tbsp golden syrup 80g self-raising flour For the toffee sauce 200ml double cream 50g soft brown sugar 25g butter 1\u00bd tbsp golden syrup 1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Butter the insides of the jars using a piece of kitchen roll. Make sure the sides and bottom are completely covered. 2 Boil the kettle. Meanwhile, finely chop the dates and put them in a bowl. Sprinkle with the bicarbonate of soda. Carefully measure out 250ml boiling water and pour over the dates. Set aside. 3 Put the butter in a mixing bowl. Add both the sugars and mix well, until it looks almost creamy. Crack in the egg and beat well. Then add the golden syrup and beat again. Add the flour and stir with a wooden spoon until it's just mixed in. Pour in the dates and water mixture, then stir well. 4 Carefully half-fill the jars with the batter. Wipe any splodges off the jars and place on a baking sheet that has a rim (so they won't slide off). Bake for 20 minutes. 5 While you're waiting, put all the toffee sauce ingredients in a small pan. Set the pan over a medium heat and stir constantly as it comes to the boil. Turn the heat down and let it bubble, stirring now and then until deliciously smooth and thick. 6 Take the sponges out of the oven. They should be golden and springy. Spoon over some of the toffee sauce and pour the rest into a jug. Serve with a scoop of ice-cream and extra sauce. The Kids Only Cookbook by Sue Quinn (Quadrille) Mexican salad What's the difference between a salad and a salsa? With big chunks it's a salad; just add leaves. With tiny sweetcorn-size bits, it's a salsa; eat it with tortilla chips, grilled fish or chicken. Serves 2 adults and 2 children, or 6 children 100g frozen sweetcorn 3 medium tomatoes 1 apple 1 large ripe avocado 1 lime 1 tsp agave syrup or sugar 2 spring onions A child's handful of coriander 1 Place the sweetcorn in a bowl and cover with boiling water from the kettle. Leave for 5 minutes until the water is cold, then drain. 2 Cut the tomatoes and apple into chunks. Place them in a bowl with the sweetcorn. Cut the avocado open. Remove the stone, then run a knife over the avocado to create a lattice. Draw lots of lines for small chunks, fewer lines for big chunks. Scoop out the chunks with a big spoon and add to the bowl. 3 Roll the whole lime on a table, pushing hard \u2013 this trick gets more juice out of it. Cut the lime in half, hold it over the bowl and squeeze each as hard as you can to get all the juice out. Add the agave syrup or sugar, and stir gently. 4 Snip off the end of each spring onion with scissors, then carefully snip each into little slices. Add to the bowl. 5 Now pick the leaves of the coriander and place them in a glass. Hold the glass with one hand, place the point of the scissors inside the glass and start chopping. Tip the coriander into the bowl and toss. Recipe by Vava Berry; valerieberry.com Chocolate salami A popular Italian treat \u2013 no baking required. The \"salami\" needs to stay in the fridge for two hours before you eat it. You'll need a good-quality freezer bag, a rubber band, clingfilm and a 10cm piece of string. Makes a 12cm salami (20 slices) 100g milk or dark cooking chocolate 25g butter 4 dried apricots 1 tbsp raisins 1 tbsp pine nuts 6 tbsp puffed rice 4 oat biscuits (or any healthy biscuits) 3 medjool dates 2 tsp icing sugar 1 To melt the chocolate, break it into squares, place in a medium bowl, add the butter and set on top of a small pan of simmering water. When the chocolate and butter are melted, stir well; remove from the water and leave to cool for 5-10 minutes. 2 Using scissors, cut the apricots into small pieces and place in a medium bowl. Add the raisins, pine nuts and puffed rice. 3 Place the biscuits in a good-quality freezer bag, pressing on it to expel the air inside. Seal the bag using a rubber band, then take a small saucepan and bash the bag until the biscuits are in small pieces (but stop before they turn to crumbs). Add the biscuit pieces to the bowl. 4 Open the dates with your fingers and remove the stones. Mash them with your fingers, then add to the other ingredients. 5 Add the chocolate to the bowl. Roll up your sleeves and start mixing the dough with your hands. When the mixture is really well blended, shape as a rough sausage and place on a square of clingfilm. Wash your hands. 6 Fold the string in half and tuck the ends into one end of the sausage so the loop sticks out. Wrap the clingfilm around the dough, then squeeze and shape into a really tight 12cm roll. Place the salami in its plastic wrapping in the fridge for at least two hours. 7 Spread the icing sugar on a plate. Unwrap the salami and roll it in the sugar. Tap, to remove any excess, slice and enjoy. Recipe by Vava Berry, valerieberry.com Chicken shawarma pitta with chop-chop salad Sandwiches stuffed and squished with all manner of different things make for a great summer supper.

Recipe supplied by Claire Thomson: @5oclockapron; 5oclockapron.com Vegetable sushi These vegetable maki are a cheap and easy way to introduce \"sushi\" to kids. You'll need a bamboo rolling mat (easily found online). Raw cucumber, carrot and peppers, cooked spinach, mushrooms, cooked sweet potato, and blanched green beans are good fillings. Makes 24 rolls 3 toasted nori sheets 300g sushi rice 3 tbsp rice vinegar 2\u00bd tbsp sugar \u00bd tbsp salt Vegetables of your choice To serve Soy sauce (optional) Pickled ginger (optional) 1 Precook the rice an hour beforehand. (It needs to be cool for you to work with.) Prepare the vegetables. 2 Once the rice is cooked, dissolve the sugar and salt in the vinegar then add it to the rice and mix well. 3 When you're ready, lay out the fillings, the cool rice, the nori sheets, and the bamboo mat, plus a bowl of water for the kids to dunk their hands in before working with the sticky rice. 4 Select one sheet of nori and place it shiny\u2011side down on the bamboo mat. Get the kids to wet their hands, pick up some of the rice and spread it on the lower third of the nori, then press it down gently with their fingers. The rice should be in a layer about 5mm thick when they're done. 5 Add the fillings to the centre of the rice and gently press them down. Feel free to try two or three fillings per roll. Always put down the biggest fillings first. Smaller fillings go on top. Don't pile the fillings too high, or it will be hard to roll. 6 Now begin rolling. Lift the end of the bamboo mat nearest to you and fold it over the ingredients. Be sure to pull the end of the mat out in front of you, so it doesn't roll up into the maki. Dip your fingers in the bowl of water and lightly moisten the end of the nori sheet furthest away from you. With a gentle rolling motion, fold the roll into the end of the nori (the part you just moistened) and seal it. Squeeze the roll gently with your hands and, with the palms of your hands, roll it back and forth between the fold of the bamboo mat to help shape the roll and ensure it is sealed. 7 Use a sharp knife to slice the kids' maki rolls into eight even pieces. Serve with soy sauce and pickled ginger, if using. Recipe adapted from thekitchn.com Pizza omelette This is a pizza with a difference. Use whatever toppings you fancy.

Ella's Kitchen Cookbook (Hamlyn) Frozen yoghurt dots These yoghurt dots are a fun riff on that pudding stalwart, the bowl of yoghurt, and are especially good for teething toddlers. If you like, you can freeze some berries to serve with the dots. Blueberries work well as they are comparable in size. Thick yoghurt or fromage frais, various flavours Frozen berries (optional) 1 Line a large tray with clingfilm and place it the freezer. 2 Once the tray is ice-cold, use a piping bag or small spoon to create small rounds of yoghurt, around the size of a 5p coin, on to the tray. 3 Freeze for at least 2 hours, or until hard. 4 Scrape off the dots and serve immediately.
