Protesters gathered on green spaces across the UK holding placards describing the lockdown rules as unlawful and claiming that the government measures were suppressing civil rights. In Hyde Park, London, about 50 people defied social distancing guidelines to gather close together at Speakers\u2019 Corner holding placards with slogans including \u201canti-vax deserves a voice\u201d and \u201cfreedom over fear\u201d. Dozens of police officers, including some on horseback, patrolled the protest, issuing 10 on-the-spot fines and making 19 arrests. Corbyn\u2019s brother, Piers, was taken away after using a megaphone to declare that 5G and the coronavirus pandemic were linked and branding the pandemic as a \u201cpack of lies to brainwash you and keep you in order\u201d. He also said \u201cvaccination is not necessary\u201d and that \u201c5G towers will be installed everywhere\u201d, adding: \u201c5G enhances anyone who\u2019s got illness from Covid, so they work together.\u201d There is no evidence to link 5G and Covid-19 and scientists fear that a rise in measles among children can be attributed in part to unfounded fears about vaccines. Corbyn was taken away after declining to leave when asked by a police officer and refusing to give his details when asked. A flyer advertising the protest called for \u201cno to mandatory vaccines, no to the new normal, and no to the unlawful lockdown\u201d. David Samson, 50, a finance worker, who attended the protests told the Press Association news agency: \u201cI never thought I\u2019d see in my generation the suppressing of civil rights [over a] fake virus. This is nothing compared to what\u2019s coming.\u201d There was a large round of boos whenever protesters were arrested, and repeated shouts of \u201cjail Bill Gates\u201d. Another demonstrator, 62-year-old Catharine Harvey, said she was defying the rules to highlight the \u201cdevastation this lockdown has caused\u201d. The shop owner said: \u201cDeveloping countries will have no trade, no tourism. I have had to close my shop on Columbia Road flower market. The effects of the lockdown are far, far worse than the virus \u2013 mental health, domestic violence, shops are closed, theatres, cinemas, restaurants. It\u2019s unnecessary.\u201d Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor said: \u201cWith the easing of restrictions we fully expected open spaces to be busy this weekend. \u201cIt was disappointing that a relatively small group in Hyde Park came together to protest the regulations in clear breach of the guidance, putting themselves and others at risk of infection. \u201cOfficers once again took a measured approach and tried to engage the group to disperse. \u201cThey clearly had no intention of doing so, and so it did result in 19 people being arrested, and a further 10 being issued with a fixed-penalty notice.\u201d A separate protest in Southampton saw about a dozen protesters gather on Southampton Common, holding placards saying \u201cStop the Lies\u201d, \u201cSay no to tyranny\u201d and \u201cFight 4 Freedom\u201d. One protester, Dee, who did not wish to give her surname, said her job in the hair and beauty industry had been hit by the crisis. She said: \u201cI am here because I am worried about civil liberties being taken away. \u201cReading the Coronavirus Act that has gone through parliament, it seems there are changes being made which infringe our freedom. And I am worried the media has run away with the Covid-19 thing and blown it all out of proportion.\u201d In Belfast, police monitored a crowd of about 20 people who had gathered in Ormeau Park to denounce the lockdown measures. Officers warned participants to socially distance and they complied. The gathering dispersed without incident after an hour. Protests also took place on Glasgow Green in Scotland, with estimates of about 40 to 50 people taking part. People at the event reportedly chanted \u201cexperts lie \u2013 people die\u201d, \u201cdon\u2019t listen to the media, listen to the people\u201d, \u201cNicola Sturgeon is a traitor\u201d and \u201cwe are not livestock\u201d. Demonstrations also took place across Europe. In Germany the death toll from the virus has been lower than most of its European neighbours with some lockdown measures already relaxed. However, protests against the measures that Chancellor Angela Merkel insists are needed to slow down the outbreak have grown with demonstrations held for a second weekend. In the UK flyers for about 60 protests to be held in parks in cities such as Manchester, Leicester and Southampton were circulated online. It is understood they were produced by the little-known UK Freedom Movement, which is thought to have links to the far right. In the US, conservative figures and rightwing groups have backed protests against stay-at-home rules in many states."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
