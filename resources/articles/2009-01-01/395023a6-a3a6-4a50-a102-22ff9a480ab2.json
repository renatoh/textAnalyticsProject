Aviva Investors, which owns 2% of the stockmarket, said it wanted a \"moratorium on pay rises\" together with \"considerable restraint and prudence\" towards bonuses as the economy deteriorates rapidly and employees face redundancy. With investors facing mounting criticism for failing to prevent the collapse of boardroom standards in Britain's banks, Aviva has taken the initiative and written to the pay consultants and City lawyers who devise remuneration for top bosses to say they must put the brake on pay. The letter notes that basic pay for directors has risen by 94% since 2000 and total cash pay, which includes short-term bonuses, is up 259%. Aviva said there was no justification for rises based on increased company size or share price. The new Lloyds Banking Group, which is 44% owned by the government, has had to withdraw plans to give pay rises to its executives after shareholders said no. The bank had argued that the pay rises were justified because it had doubled in size after its rescue takeover of HBOS. Aviva said many companies had \"paid little more than lip service\" to pay and conditions for staff but said \"particular attention\" should be given to employees, especially where a \"company is retrenching and/or making redundancies\". Special awards and retention packages will also be rejected by Aviva, which believes such deals for key executives are \"inappropriate, ineffective ... and poorly designed\". The fund management group, which prides itself on its corporate governance record, is also urging consultants and lawyers to look for ways to change bosses' contracts so bonuses can be clawed back if it becomes clear they were earned on an \"illusory performance\". It makes special reference to bankers \u2013 the subject of most criticism after profits were wiped out by credit crunch write-downs and share prices shattered by government bail-outs \u2013 whose pay it argues should be \"risk-adjusted\". Aviva also wants companies to compare pension benefits for directors with those available for staff and said it wanted a say in pay issues, rather than just being presented with \"a fait accompli\". It warns companies \"the sensitivity of executive pay issues should be obvious\". The letter was signed by Iain Richards, Aviva Investors' regional head of corporate governance. But the fund manager declined to comment on its contents. It is understood that Aviva sounded out other investors about the tone of the letter, which reflects sentiment among most major investors. The investment community has been stunned by criticism of its inability to rein in corporate excess in the run-up to the credit crunch. Lord Myners, City minister, has suggested shareholders were not doing their job properly. Legal &amp; General tried to defend institutional investors at a frank meeting with MPs this week, insisting it had repeatedly asked for the resignations of Royal Bank of Scotland's chairman, Sir Tom McKillop, and chief executive, Sir Fred Goodwin. The two men refused to quit until the government made their departure a condition of a \u00a320bn taxpayer bail-out. Executive pay is also being discussed in the House of Lords, where the Labour peer Lord Gavron has introduced a private members' bill that would require firms to state the ratio of bosses' to workers' pay at the front of the annual report. Aviva is also objecting to attempts to retrospectively reduce performance targets to ensure bonuses are paid out. Earlier this month shareholders threw out the remuneration report of the housebuilder Bellway after it made such adjustments. It was only the second time that a vote had gone against a remuneration report since GlaxoSmithKline five years ago. Other firms trying to push through pay rises are being warned that they stand to be treated the same way as Bellway. Similarly, Aviva has warned firms they will need permission to change any targets."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
