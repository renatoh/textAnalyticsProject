The club's British record signing will lead the line against Basel at St Jakob-Park in the first leg of their Europa League semi-final on Thursday as he attempts to maintain the eye-catching form that has illuminated Chelsea's campaign to date. Torres has mustered 18 goals and impressed in recent outings, suggesting a return to the form that earned him a \u00a350m move to Stamford Bridge in January 2011 and fuelling his desire to see out his contract despite the club's ambition to add to their options up front. Asked specifically about Falcao, who is expected to leave Atl\u00e9tico Madrid this summer, with Chelsea one of a clutch of elite clubs hopeful of securing the Colombian's signature, Torres said: \"When you play for Chelsea you're always hoping big players come and the big names are always being linked. You cannot stop that, especially when the summer comes. Every player is welcome at Chelsea, every top player. Since I came to Chelsea only top players have come, so it would not be a surprise [if Chelsea signed Falcao]. \"I know I want to stay here. I want to be at Chelsea at least the next two years. If they change their minds it's a different question, but the relationship between me and the club is always very straight. It's not a problem at all. I have always felt part of the club. Things have changed [since last year when he appeared to be an understudy for Didier Drogba] and you could see this season that I've been the main striker, then Demba Ba came to join the club. \"But I really think the club always told me the truth. They have hopes of me. They trust in me.\" The Europa League is the only trophy Chelsea can claim from a campaign that will be extended to 62 games against the Swiss side, who have not lost in six European home matches and top their domestic league. The interim manager, Rafael Ben\u00edtez, must juggle his ambition to win a trophy with the necessity to qualify for the Champions League and, having slipped to fourth place in the Premier League, is unlikely to risk starting with Ashley Cole or Gary Cahill, who have travelled to Basel after lay-offs through hamstring and knee injuries respectively. \"They have very good players, are well organised and work very hard as a team,\" said Ben\u00edtez. \"It will be tough. We can talk about Manchester United before [in last season's Champions League group stage], we can talk about Tottenham now [in the Europa League quarter-final]. Those teams are top level and still could not win their games at Basel. \"My message in the last months is we have to be in the Champions League \u2013 especially for the players. It depends on them, their performance on the pitch. If we can win a trophy, that also depends on players. For me, everything will be a bonus, fantastic. If we win [the Europa League], if we finish in the top three \u2026 but the players have to realise it is more important even for them.\" Ben\u00edtez is keen to land a trophy as tangible reward from his seven-month spell at the club. \"We assume it will be until the end of the season and that's it,\" he said. \"I have to do my job. How will I be remembered? I hope [for being] professional, working hard, trying to do my best.\" Chelsea have lost four of their past five European away games. Torres, as the only recognised striker in the squad given Ba is cup-tied, will start, with the forward hopeful success in the competition would serve to further the development of a new-look side ahead of next season. \"I hope there's more to come from me as I'm still young, and I want to win many things for this club,\" he said. \"We've won the Champions League and we could win the Europa League this season but we can [go on and] win much more. \"We have improved as a team this season, and the squad and the players we have are young and can still do great things. I would like to be involved in this team for the next few years. We can become one of the best sides not just in England but in Europe.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
