The Everton captain speaks from experience as a player who, along with his brother Gary, has been a target of fearsome abuse in the past. Neville, who led his side in their defeat at Manchester United yesterday, appreciates the stance taken by Portsmouth's Sol Campbell who claimed last week that the vitriol had \"gone too far\" in the wake of the reception he was given by Tottenham Hotspur fans the previous weekend. Neville, though, also feels that many players do not help themselves due to their confrontational approach to some referees and he says young players earning fortunes at clubs have it far too easy. \"As footballers, we need to look at ourselves,\" Neville said. \"Eighty to 90% of footballers handle themselves with dignity and in the right way. But it's a small minority that are letting us down, and the vast amounts of money we earn means we have a lot of responsibility and are there to be shot at. \"If we are going out for a drink then you have to make sure you are going to the right places and behave in the right way. If you don't, let's make sure the punishment is severe enough so you don't do it again. I look at young kids at clubs now and they don't seem to have the same upbringing in terms of punishment and things like that. There's a softness coming through, not helped by the foreign influence. \"I know when I was an apprentice I not only did my football duties, I went to college one day a week and I also cleaned boots, showers and cars. Nowadays, they are not allowed to do that. I asked a young apprentice at Everton the other day to fill the fridge up with drinks for the first team and the youth coach said he was not allowed to do that. \"I find it incredible there is that softness because young players are being paid vast amounts of money and they don't seem to be working for that money. Too much is coming too soon to these players.\" Neville said one way to address the behaviour of younger players was for seasoned professionals to provide a better example and stop verbally abusing match officials. \"We need to look after ourselves a lot better than we are doing, both on and off the pitch, but it is only a small minority,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. \"For young kids coming through, it is only right for them to look at us as examples. \"Having a go at referees, and the language used by footballers nowadays, is not acceptable. Maybe that's where we need to improve.\" PA"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
