Jostling for the headlines that day were the manager's debut and a stunning goal by the then darling of the Bramall Lane terraces, Paul Devlin. Brown was barely noticed by the home fans, who were just relieved to watch their team win after the short-lived regime of Adrian Heath. Warnock must have spotted something the crowd missed, because 40 days later Brown became the new manager's first signing. He announced his arrival with the only goal of the game - a superb 20-yard shot - against the club that had just sold him, Manchester City. And so began the renaissance of a career that had started with great promise, went awry and is now back on track. If there is one player to watch out for in tomorrow's play-off final, it is Brown. Signed straight from comprehensive school in Hartlepool, Brown was playing for City in the Premiership at 18. A year later, he was earning \u00a35,000 a week playing alongside Georgiou Kinkladze, Niall Quinn and Nigel Clough. Five England under-21 caps followed and, although his popularity at Maine Road grew, his on-field and off-field behaviour was beginning to frustrate fans and managers. If his entry on the Friends Reunited website is anything to go by, Brown was revelling in his sudden wealth, status and role as chief wind-up merchant. 'I was earning \u00a35,000 a week at the age of 19 and playing in the Premier League. Eric Cantona once nutted me after a game and Roy Keane tried to but couldn't catch me!' Just like Lee Sharpe across at Old Trafford, Brown was falling prey to the trappings of success and the illusion of invincibility. The word was that Brown was spending more time in the pub than on the training ground. With plenty of midfielders to choose from, and under pressure to reduce the playing staff, Joe Royle dispatched him on loan to Portsmouth, managed by Royle's old pal Alan Ball. Frozen out at Maine Road and with a bright future in tatters, Brown changed his attitude. After his sobering experience on the South Coast, he was offered a second chance by Warnock, and to his credit the midfielder took it. Despite that debut goal, it would be 18 months before Brown really made an impact. Two goals in a solid, if unexceptional, first full season suggested little of what was to come. That all changed last season. With midfield colleague Devlin making little secret of his desire to leave, Brown, in the spotlight, grabbed the opportunity. Despite often playing out of position, and missing several games through injury, he turned in a string of sparkling performances that won him the player-of-the-year award. Brown has matured into the player he was always capable of becoming. He is tough, but nimble enough to dance through opposition defences and deliver crosses from unfeasibly tight angles. The attitude that once threatened to drag him into obscurity has largely gone, evolving with age into a mischievousness that is both his strength and his weakness. Restored to the spine of the team, with the veteran Stuart McCall anchoring the midfield, Warnock's 'likeable rogue' has been given the freedom to express himself and hone his remarkable knack of scoring special goals. A return of 22 in league and cup would be the envy of most strikers; for a midfielder it is phenomenal. No wonder he is widely regarded as one of the best players in the division - the best, according to Steve Coppell - and is being linked with a number of Premiership clubs. For now, he says, he is happy where he is. 'I love it here and would love to play for Sheffield United in the Premiership. Sometimes your future's not in your hands, but I'm not thinking that far ahead.' The fact that he is stalling on United's new contract offer suggests the debate over a possible exit has moved on to 'when' rather than 'if', but Warnock is not worried. 'He'd love us to get in the Premiership and if we do there's no way he'd go anywhere,' says the manager. 'His career was going nowhere before he came here. He knows that. We've spoken about me and him, how quickly that would go with another manager. Certain things that happen with him at the training ground other managers might not put up with.' Whatever Brown says, his future is very much in his own hands. If he plays well, United play well. And if they play well tomorrow, Brown can look forward to next season in the Premiership.
