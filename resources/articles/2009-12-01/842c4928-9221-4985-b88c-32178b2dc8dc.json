Even more worrying is that this sickening practice is becoming increasingly evident in Britain, leaving victims with permanent scarring, blindness, and a lifetime struggling with shame. Sixty-seven people in Britain were admitted to hospitals in 2007-08 after being \"assaulted with a corrosive substance\", according to the NHS Information Centre. Forty-four were admitted the previous year. Acid attacks where the perpetrator is a relative of the victim are common in the Indian subcontinent. Often a woman is attacked when she rejects a marriage proposal or declines her husband's sexual advance, or her family discovers she has a boyfriend. An attack is not intended to kill but to permanently disfigure so that the victims will always remember what they did. The practice is seeping into Britain, as part of so-called \"honour violence\", when individuals are punished by their families. The perpetrators are said to extract acid from car batteries or use contacts in laboratories or schools to obtain sulphuric and hydrochloric acid. A charity called Acid Survivors Trust International is carrying out the first ever research into this issue in Britain and will work with ethnic minority communities in areas such as Bradford and Glasgow to look into the motives of attacks. One victim is Farah, who had acid thrown on her face by her two brothers in Birmingham after they discovered she had married her black boyfriend. The 21-year-old said: One of my brothers came towards me and started kicking me. He said my beauty had got me into trouble in the first place and threw something at my face. All I remember is that my face was burning and I fainted. The scars on my face will always be a reminder of what they have done. I don't ever want to see my family again. I am determined to go where they will never find me to live my life normally. Maybe then I'll reunite with my husband. Farah's story should be reason alone for the authorities to act and address the fact that acid attacks are a hidden issue. Five years ago, forced marriages were a taboo subject. While the scale of the problem is still not known, it has been thrust into the limelight and is now taken seriously by the government. This has led to more victims coming forward and support groups being given funding to tackle the issue. It is important to nip in the bud the spread of acid attacks, starting with an awareness campaign about the impact it has on victims and the punishments for such callous actions. There is real danger of the problem escalating if cases of attacks are dismissively seen as isolated incidents. Recent cases include a woman being charged with assault and grievous bodily harm after throwing acid in a man's face in west London, and an accountant being jailed for hurling hydrochloric acid over three high court lawyers. The best way to tackle this issue appears to be providing resources for support groups. Because of the recession and a change of tack by the government, these services are in danger of being phased out as local councils are merging them with mainstream services. One high-profile casualty could be the Honour Network helpline, Britain's only national advice line for victims of forced marriages and honour attacks. It has received more than 6,700 calls since being launched in April 2008 by the Karma Nirvana charity. From January, the helpline will restrict its opening hours and unless it finds more funding, it will close. It has not received any government money since April when a \u00a343,000 grant from the Forced Marriage Unit ran out. Another is the Iranian and Kurdish Women's Rights Organisation, a charity that helps victims of honour violence. It will not have its funding renewed in 2010. The importance of specialist services like these cannot be stressed enough, especially to tackle an issue shrouded in stigma like acid attacks. These charities have bilingual counsellors and more importantly an understanding of the cultural nuances that prevent victims coming forward."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
