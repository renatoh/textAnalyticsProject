Bell was so angry when he learned that the West Stand of the new City of Manchester Stadium would be renamed after the former manager Joe Mercer that his family have written to the chairman John Wardle complaining of their \"shock and surprise\". Wardle was so embarrassed that he has arranged to meet Bell today in hopes of placating a player who made almost 500 appearances for the club, scoring 150 goals and winning 48 England caps during his time at Maine Road. One option to be put to him is that an approach road to the stadium will be named after him. The reason for Bell being so upset is that his name had polled the most votes when the club's supporters were asked in March to decide from a six-man short list who most deserved the honour. His family were told he had \"convincingly won\", only to learn seven months later that the stand would \"definitely not\" be named after him. City's explanation is that they suspected rival fans had \"hijacked\" the Internet vote, and Wardle says he has ordered an investigation. \"I am concerned about this whole issue,\" he said. They feared the player had been voted for so that fans from other clubs would have the opportunity to refer to the stand as the Bell End.\" Jon Bell, writing on behalf of his father, describes him as \"deeply concerned\" and accuses the club of going back on their word. \"As a family, proud of our father's achievements, we simply cannot understand City's rationale for apparently failing to comply with the fans' vote. If there was no intention to name the stand after Colin Bell, then his name should have been excluded from the list.\" He also says his father had contacted the club's managing director Alistair Mackintosh because he was so concerned \"with the manner in which the voting was being either ignored or manipulated\". The Dr Martens tycoon Max Griggs announced yesterday that he is to sever his ties with Rushden &amp; Diamonds after spending 11 years and an estimated \u00a330m on the club. He has been at the helm at Nene Park in Irthlingborough, Northamptonshire, since the summer of 1992, when he merged Rushden Town and Irthlingborough Diamonds, two non-league clubs who, in their combined guise, have risen to the Second Division. Griggs, who is 65, said he had done all he could and was now willing to let someone else take the Diamonds forward. \"When we set out in 1992 my intention was to give something back to the local community and to achieve league football for the area. \"In these two areas I have fulfilled my ambitions. I am not looking for any financial gain. I would be happy to pass on Rushden &amp; Diamonds Football Club to the right person for nothing.\" Griggs added that the stadium and surrounding industrial units would also be put up for sale. The manager Brian Talbot and managing director Mark Darnell will lead the search for new owners."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
