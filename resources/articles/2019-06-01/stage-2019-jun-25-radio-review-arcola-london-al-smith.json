It\u2019s not that Radio isn\u2019t lovely to watch. Josh Roche directs with graceful restraint and Sophie Thomas\u2019s set is backed by sweeping colourful strings that hint at radio waves, jet streams, swinging hammocks and shooting stars. Adam Gillen is quietly compelling as a young boy who dreams of space travel but finds himself crashing back down to Earth with a thud. However, there\u2019s something about Al Smith\u2019s searching 2006 play \u2013 which has been revived by Audible, the audiobook and podcast company, to mark the 50th anniversary of the first moon landing \u2013 that\u2019ll make you want to close your eyes and dream. Gillen plays Charles L Fairbanks Jr as a walking apology of a man, rippling with regret and with a forgotten sparkle in his eyes. Charles falteringly remembers his childhood spent growing up in \u201cflatter than a pancake\u201d Kansas, the exact centre of the US. Gently, and oh so cleverly, Smith reminds us that this country that Charles believes in, the father he loves, the flag he waves proudly, the ambitions of becoming an astronaut, which he wears like a badge of honour, all are founded on shaky ground indeed. This is a peculiarly subtle show and sometimes it feels a little too still and thoughtful, a little too \u201cmade for radio\u201d perhaps. But there are moments that\u2019ll transport you, lift you up with the radio waves and take you to a different and more hopeful time. There\u2019s also a sticky sort of sadness to this play about a country that dares to dream big yet is doomed, surely, to fail. \u2022 At the Arcola, London, until 13 July."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
