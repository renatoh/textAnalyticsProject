So in November 2008, the image of a youthful Elvis Presley signalled that money had not been so cheap since his first hit; in December, rates dropped to 2%, pushing the precedent back to Battersea pleasure gardens in the Festival of Britain. Some time in early 2009, however, the black and white snaps disappeared. The 0.5% rate set that March has, as of this week, now prevailed for five full years. But at the time it was without precedent in the 315\u2013year history of the Bank of England. Go back to the days of William III's full-bottomed wig, and you still find nothing like the ultra-low rates which have become the new normal. This was an experiment which some thought dangerous, and others irrelevant, but it is one which has proved its worth. Some leftwingers doubted monetary policy could do any good unless it came coupled to deficit-financed public works, a prospect which always grabs the socialist imagination more than prosaic monetary management. In the name of Keynes, although without regard for the large parts of his work which stress cheap money as the first response in a slump, these critics pronounced a \"liquidity trap\", and suggested cheap money would achieve nothing more than \"pushing on a piece of string\". Some voices on the right, meanwhile, were raised in instinctive sympathy with savers with cash in the bank. Especially after quantitative easing was added to the monetary mix in early 2009, these voices warned that thrift was being penalised, painful but necessary economic adjustment postponed, and dangerous inflation created. Some of these worries have been borne out, especially in the dismal productivity figures and the inflationary spike of the last couple of years; likewise, the low road that GDP followed as coalition cuts began biting lent support to the leftish insistence on the primacy of fiscal policy. In the grimmest assessment of all, cheap money is pumping a new bubble which will soon enough bust, wreaking fresh ruin on an unreformed economy. This dismal view is, however, almost as speculative as the financial behaviour that it condemns. For all the undoubted disappointments of these last five years, super-low rates find all the vindication they need in the relatively short dole queue. Yes, there are far too many unreliable jobs, and yes, unemployment remains too high. But given the scale of the calamity that hit the economy in 2008, worklessness has been nothing like as bad as we had any right to expect. Whereas in previous downturns, each percent knocked off output translated into at least an equivalent drop in jobs, during the recent slump a 7% decline in output pushed the employment rate down by only about two points. This is a tremendous contrast not only with the 1980s and 1990s, but also the Great Depression, when a slightly smaller overall hit to the UK economy was initially answered with the \"sound money\" requirements of the gold standard, and unemployment shot through the roof. Super-low rates have, then, proved preferable to the alternative, but that did not guarantee they would prevail. For they undoubtedly have their costs \u2013 as anyone trying to retire with a money-purchase pension is keenly aware. The squeeze on modest investments helps explain why politicians have felt obliged to protect universal perks for pensioners at the same time as savaging welfare for the young. But overall, savers, who are more numerous than mortgage borrowers in Britain, have been fairly quiet. George Osborne, who during the darkest hour in 2008 pledged in frightening 1930s parlance to \"put sound money first\", has in office done no such thing, instead encouraging the Bank of England to run rather more risks with inflation for the sake of growth. The chancellor's record is wanting in many ways, but where interest rates are concerned, the change of administration in 2010 made no difference at all. And however stagnant Britain remains, it should be grateful for that. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 March 2014. The earlier version referred to mortgagees where mortgage borrowers (or mortgagors) was meant; mortgagees are mortgage lenders."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
