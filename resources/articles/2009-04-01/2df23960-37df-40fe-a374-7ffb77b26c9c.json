The report of the All Party Parliamentary Football Group, which will be published today, is understood to be critical of the current constitution, in which the chief executive, Richard Scudamore, and part-time chairman, Sir David Richards, are the Premier League's only directors. According to sources close to the inquiry, the group concluded that the structure gives Scudamore and Richards too much control over decision-making, and makes the Premier League not sufficiently accountable. The report is expected to recommend the appointment of independent non-executive directors, possibly including a supporters' representative, to provide checks and a wider context to the running of the league. The report is also expected to call for the Football Association to introduce a licensing system, defining specific rules to govern clubs, including a prohibition on clubs spending more than they earn. That is understood to mean that clubs should not rely on borrowing \u2013 or, more controversially, billionaire backers \u2013 to finance wage bills that would otherwise not be affordable. The Parliamentary group, chaired by the backbench Labour MP Alan Keen, does not have any power to insist its recommendations be implemented, but the report will add to the current debates about football's direction and its finances. The source said Keen and the group's other 11 members, including Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader, concluded that the wider financial crisis lends more urgency to the need for football to improve its governance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
