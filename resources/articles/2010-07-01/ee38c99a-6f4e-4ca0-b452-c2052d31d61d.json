Like many auteur figures, he cuts an odd dash. Grungy-looking, with a stoop and neurotic mannerisms, he talks quickly, tangentially, constantly self-analysing. On the subject of his music, though, he speaks fearlessly, with conviction. \"I was been raised to believe I was an artist,\" he says. \"I believed what my parents said and fulfilled it, like a prophecy.\" Ariel has been making music since 1996, recording from a bedroom studio in Pico-Roberson, Los Angeles. A peculiar melange of psychedelia, 80s drivetime pop and white funk, Pink's music gains an extra weird frisson thanks to his taste for imperfect recording fidelity; his songs have a woozy sound akin to the fuzz of a well-used VHS tape. It's a sonic hallmark that's been influential, primarily on the current crop of so-called \"chillwave\" artists like Washed Out, Toro Y Moi, and Memory Tapes, touting lo-fi takes on 80s pop. Ariel's music is not nostalgic \u2013 he sounds like nothing but himself \u2013 but he is protective of the music he loves. \"All we have is the past, but for people of the future, there's not even going to be a history there,\" he worries. \"The history of recorded music has turned into a flat fucking screen of an iTunes playlist.\" He raises his voice: \"I'm preserving something that's going extinct! That's all rock'n'roll has been since day one. It's all necrophilia.\" Ariel is a child of eerie LA, the one of David Lynch's Mulholland Drive and Alex Cox's Repo Man, the one soundtracked by the Doors and the Germs. He sits far outside Hollywood, but observes it with fascination: \"Some people don't have the stamina for LA, But the people that stay there, that learn to exist there, those people are very much what LA is about. It's a place where chaos reigns, dreams run amok. You get all these wonderful by-products from this tapestry of lost souls.\" Ariel could have stayed on the outside were it not for meeting Animal Collective in 2003. He handed the band a CD-R of his music and they then released several Ariel Pink albums on their Paw Tracks imprint. A proper record deal has previously eluded him; in the end, it took a new \"professional\" attitude and a full Haunted Graffiti band. His excellent 4AD debut, Before Today, cleans up some of the rough edges, but there's still a perversity resistant to any marketing polish. The Guide tells Ariel that reading what people say about his music, they always make it sound ironic or kitsch, but on actually listening, it's surprising how heartfelt it is. His eyes gleam: \"Maybe that's the irony. I take it seriously; I take everything I do way too seriously.\" Before Today is out now on 4AD"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
