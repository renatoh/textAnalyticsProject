A song meant to protest Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s (Ice) controversial network of detention camps and their policy of separating children from their parents, it\u2019s part of a new direction for the rapper both lyrically and musically. \u201cThere was one particular comment made by Matthew Albence that inspired the song,\u201d Mensa says from his label Roc Nation\u2019s New York City headquarters of the current deputy director of Ice. \u201cHe said that immigrant detention centers were more like a summer camp than a prison. It was obviously an extremely disrespectful and offensive distinction, but I also found it to be really interesting in a dark way.\u201d With his creativity piqued and with an urge to speak out, Mensa started jotting down lyrics and took the idea of crafting a song about a summer camp literally, right down to its singalong chorus that brushes up against brash verses, such as: \u201cTake your clothes off baby, let me see what you got / We can have a good time if you\u2019re legal or not / It\u2019s an ignorant, arrogant, terrorist, heritage / You can finally be an American.\u201d Explains Mensa: \u201cThinking about the artists I\u2019ve loved through the years, my favorites are the ones who\u2019ve made music with cultural, societal and political significance. The Clash is pretty much my favorite band, and their songs like Rock the Casbah are political dance tracks. I like music and art with dimension that you can appreciate on different levels.\u201d Fans of Mensa won\u2019t be surprised by his increased desire to make music with an added dimension given his specific worldview, built on a foundation of growing up in Chicago and a childhood spent on the city\u2019s South Side, a reality he likened to living in a dual world. \u201cI came from a two-parent household and my father is a PhD from west Africa, but at the same time I grew up five blocks from where Obama lived and five blocks from the projects,\u201d he says of having a front-row seat to social injustice while also gaining an appreciation for his own fortunate situation. \u201cThe disparity between the haves and have-nots was always blatantly obvious to me, and it\u2019s that exact gap that drove me to start writing and pick up a pen. I wanted to explain and understand the world around me because it was easy to see it was corrupted.\u201d With that in mind, Mensa started building a career. The strength of his 2013 mixtape Inanetape (which also featured close friend and fellow hip-hop social activist Chance the Rapper) landed him on the cover of XXL magazine\u2019s Freshman Class in 2014 and he signed a deal with Jay-Z\u2019s Roc Nation. Along the way, he\u2019s helped pen tracks for Kanye West (his Wolves scored a Grammy nomination for best rap song in 2014) while Mensa\u2019s debut album, 2017\u2019s The Autobiography, cemented his status as a hip-hop force. But despite his success in the genre, Mensa is quick to point out that he was actually a fan of rock before he developed an appreciation for rap. He was most taken with acts like the aforementioned Clash and the Cranberries, releasing a cover of Zombie on the anniversary of lead singer Dolores O\u2019Riordan\u2019s death this past January. \u201cSome of the most punk people in my mind are Nick Cave doing piano ballads or Lou Reed. He wasn\u2019t the loudest, but he was singing about transgender people in Walk on the Wild Side. It\u2019s a spirit of rebellion, anti-establishment and counterculture.\u201d Taking its moniker from a clothing line of the same name and using Pharrell Williams\u2019 band NERD as a template, 93PUNX (the 93 derived from Mensa\u2019s birth year) turned into the perfect vehicle to channel his frustration concerning the current political climate. \u201cIt felt to me like an opportunity to use music as a commentary on the ills of society, and as a way to say \u2018fuck you\u2019 to the oppressors,\u201d says Mensa. \u201cIt was a different creative process for me than doing rap music where I\u2019d listen to a beat over and over again and write on top of it. With a lot of these 93PUNX songs, I\u2019d sit down with a concept in mind and figure out how to convey the message in that concept.\u201d When Camp America was released earlier this month, it received immediate blowback from conservative news outlets like Breitbart, attacking Mensa for the video in which he stars as an Ice agent. One article (headline: Rapper Vic Mensa Puts White Kids in Cages in \u2018Camp America\u2019 Video) garnered over 1,300 comments including one calling Mensa \u201ca tattooed racist thug\u201d and many others sharing that sentiment. \u201cI think that we get so desensitized to egregious human rights offenses today because of the advent of social media, global interconnectivity and instant gratification of the internet,\u201d Mensa says of his overarching goal of the video and song. \u201cSeeing so many images of immigrants detained and being treated like criminals and kids with emergency tinfoil blankets sleeping on the ground behind chain-link fences, people forget how fucked up it is. [I\u2019m talking] specifically about those who support the people who push these policies of family separation through.\u201d While it\u2019s clear Mensa doesn\u2019t support President Trump, he\u2019s throwing his weight behind Bernie Sanders to unseat him in 2020. \u201cI voted for Bernie last time around and went to a private talk he was doing in Hollywood the other day,\u201d he says, noting that Sanders\u2019 track record is what sold him. \u201cI like the fact he was fighting with us as far back as the civil rights movement. You can see the receipts on Bernie, he was getting beat up alongside black people in the 70s. So his motivations to me are clear.\u201d At the same time, Mensa is frank about what he calls the perils of imperialistic capitalism. \u201cWhether it\u2019s Trump, Obama, Clinton or Bush, behind the scenes the same things go in any presidency by nature when the dollar is the most valuable commodity above all else, even human life,\u201d he explains, pointing out that labels like Democrat, Republican, liberal and progressive are \u201cones people hide white supremacy behind\u201d. Says Mensa of Clinton in particular and the increased incarceration rates under his presidency, \u201cAt the time, he was playing the saxophone and it was like, \u2018He\u2019s the first black president!\u2019 But in actuality, his 1994 crime bill (the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994) destroyed our communities. He didn\u2019t objectify us in the same way as Trump, but the policies that passed through his pen destroyed us just as much, if not more.\u201d With a full 93PUNX album due by the end of the summer, Mensa alludes to lyrics that will touch on hot button issues concerning sexual assault and toxic masculinity. But at the same time, don\u2019t expect it to be a protest record either. \u201cWhile there are moments that are political, it\u2019s not explicitly a political record,\u201d he notes. \u201cThere are also moments that are personal as well. But at the same time, there\u2019s a famous refrain in the movement spaces that the personal is always the political.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
