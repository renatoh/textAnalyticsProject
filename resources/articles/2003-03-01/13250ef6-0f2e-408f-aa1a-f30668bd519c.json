Chelsea found themselves engaging in a similar exercise on Saturday except that to describe Manchester City as a works team would be an insult to shop floors everywhere. Claudio Ranieri's side will nevertheless benefit from this exercise when they face Arsenal at Stamford Bridge tomorrow night in an FA Cup quarter-final replay. Scoring five times against rank bad defending should stand Chelsea in good stead when they reacquaint themselves with Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's wobbly back four. Ranieri now has to decide whether the strategy which brought his team this impressive victory should be retained for the Cup replay. On Saturday Chelsea's strikers, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Eidur Gudjohnsen, were closely supported by Gianfranco Zola. Playing all three again tomorrow might weaken the midfield defensively. Zola, nonetheless, made out a powerful case for again being on at the start, his instep cradling the ball as if it were a new-laid egg. He was the illusionist, City the stooges. \"He's a player I've always admired,\" said Kevin Keegan once his spleen concerning City's non-performance had been exhausted. \"He has brains, talent and commitment. I haven't got anything quite like that in my squad.\" Keegan was entitled to be equally envious of Chelsea's defence. Tomorrow Ranieri will have the luxurious option of keeping Marcel Desailly, just back from injury, on the bench because the centre-back partnership of John Terry and William Gallas is doing so well. Manchester City's defending is still not up to Premiership standards. They have now conceded 49 goals, only one fewer than poor, porous Sunderland. The fact that Chelsea did not score until eight minutes from half-time was largely down to Peter Schmeichel's goalkeeping. Then Zola's cunningly flighted chip to the far post deceived Sylvain Distin and he let it fall to Hasselbaink, whose volley had too much power for Schmeichel, falling backwards, to keep it out. This was the start of a Chelsea cannonade. Terry, unmarked, headed in Graeme Le Saux's hard-driven corner six minutes later, then glanced on a corner from Hasselbaink for Mario Stanic to tap in a third two minutes before the hour. Frank Lampard worked a simple one-two with a substitute, Carlton Cole, before adding Chelsea's fourth in the 69th minute and Gallas completed the scoring 10 minutes later after Stanic had caught City square with a sharp nod-on. City's woebegone afternoon was completed by the dismissal in stoppage time of one of their substitutes, Sun Jihai, for a second bookable offence. In truth the sun had set a little earlier with the departure of Zola. \"I'm not going to slag any of my players off in front of you because I don't do that,\" Keegan told reporters. So he slagged them off collectively, Schmeichel excepted. Manager and staff had been insulted and City's travelling fans had not had value for money. Robbie Fowler was barely mentioned apart from the information that his substitution at half-time had been because of a damaged shoulder. It could not have been suffered by putting it to the wheel.
