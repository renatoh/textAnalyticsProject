Chris had been involved in community projects in his Warwick and Leamington constituency, including spending a week renovating a local youth club, and decided to use the opportunity to support the voluntary and social enterprise sectors. Picking up on one of our manifesto recommendations, the bill calls for public sector procurers to try to weave in social and environmental value that's beyond the primary purpose of a contract. For example, they could require contractors \u2013 whether they are civil society organisations or private businesses \u2013 to deliver services in a way that also creates local jobs for disadvantaged groups or reduces a company's waste and carbon emissions. Social enterprises have been delivering services in this way for years, finding inventive ways to deliver contracts and reinvesting profits back into the community. For example, social enterprise bus company HCT Group runs public transport routes around the country, including London red buses, school transport and park and ride services. They regularly tender for new contracts and always offer added social value, such as training long term unemployed people as bus drivers and employing them through the service. The enterprise was started in the 1980s with six vehicles and a group of volunteers, and now has a turnover in excess of \u00a328m and employs over 700 people. Recognising the benefits that this can bring to local communities, some local authorities have already started to factor social value into commissioning and procurement showing that it's possible. Camden Council has worked with the new economics foundation to implement a way of commissioning that systematically takes into account the wider social, economic and environmental impacts of services, using outcomes drawn from Camden's sustainable community strategy. Similarly, Durham council (one of the largest in the country) has worked with legal experts to implement a Whole Life Value programme that incorporates social and environmental criteria into commissioning and procurement practice. Even though this approach doesn't have to cost more and can even save local authorities money in cross-departmental savings, many procurement officers feel powerless to be creative and buy services in this way. In an environment where the lowest price has often been the default position, a cultural shift needs to be encouraged by chief executives and other senior colleagues. By supporting procurement officers to consider social value, councils could make a huge difference to the overall value that communities around the UK get from the considerable \u00a3236bn that the government spends each year on procurement. This proposed legislation would greatly benefit communities at any time, but now more than ever \u2013 we need decisions that are going to bring about economic and social recovery. Following the mass lobby we held on the day of the bill's second reading last November, social enterprises are rallying behind it again ahead of its first committee reading on 19 October. Last week, we met the civil society minister Nick Hurd to ask for his support and soon Chris White will be visiting Street League, a charity that runs education and training programmes for disadvantaged 16-25 year olds. Meanwhile, social enterprises, charities and their supporters are writing to the committee to let them know how much of a difference the bill if it becomes law would make to communities.
