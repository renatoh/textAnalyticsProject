The Wales manager\u2019s current contract expires after the European Championship finals in France this summer and he wants to stay on to lead his country into the 2018 World Cup qualifying campaign. But talks still have some way to go if Coleman is to continue in the job he took up in January 2012, despite steering the country to their first major tournament in over half a century. Coleman said: \u201cWe opened negotiations last Monday and it never went very far. But it wasn\u2019t disappointing because it\u2019s an important decision to go into the World Cup, for me and Wales. \u201cIt has to be right. I didn\u2019t expect the first negotiations to be: \u2018Great, is that it? Let\u2019s do it.\u2019 It\u2019s not going to be like that. We are apart. \u201cI\u2019ve never signed a contract where the first negotiations are: \u2018You want that? I can give you that. Shake hands and it\u2019s done.\u2019 That never happens.\u201d Wales continue their Euro 2016 build-up this week with friendlies against fellow finalists Northern Ireland and Ukraine. Coleman\u2019s side welcome Michael O\u2019Neill\u2019s men to Cardiff on Thursday before Wales play in Kiev four days later, and the manager says contract talks will have to wait until after both games. Last week Coleman announced Gareth Bale was to be omitted from his squad for the two friendlies after the Real Madrid forward\u2019s recent injury struggles. However, Bale scored and hit the bar in Real\u2019s 4-0 league win against Sevilla on Sunday. Coleman added: \u201cI\u2019m now in game mode \u2013 all I can think about is Northern Ireland. Everything else has to wait until those two weeks are done, and once it is we go straight back into it. The powers that be know me \u2013 they know I just want to get my head down with these two games. It\u2019s not a stalling tactic because it\u2019s all about the games. \u201cOnce they have gone, then who knows? In the next one we could nail it. Ideally it will be done before we go to the tournament \u2013 but if we don\u2019t agree, then it won\u2019t be done.\u201d Earlier this month Coleman expressed his wish for contract discussions to take in changes to the Welsh national side\u2019s set-up to help the side in future qualification campaigns. He said: \u201cIt is not just about my personal contract but what we see in terms of the structure and whether we go on to do the things we need to make sure it is not a one-off. Qualifying for France cannot be a one-off.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
