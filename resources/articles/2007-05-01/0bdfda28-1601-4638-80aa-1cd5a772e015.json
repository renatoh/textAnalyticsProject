A group carried out an act of religious terrorism on American soil, raining indiscriminate death on innocent people. It remains a scar on the country's collective memory. This was the 'other' 11 September, in 1857, when fundamentalist Mormon settlers opened fire on a wagon train, leaving more than 120 men, women and children dead in a flowery field. The Mountain Meadows Massacre, which happened about 300 miles south of Salt Lake City in Utah, is an episode often left out of history books in Britain and even in the United States. There will be no hiding place next month when Hollywood delivers a retelling of Mormonism's darkest hour. September Dawn, starring Jon Voight and Terence Stamp, draws parallels between the Mormon militia and today's Islamist terrorists. The film promises to be highly controversial among the 5.8 million Americans who belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as the Mormon church is officially known. There is even speculation that it could have an impact on the presidential campaign of Mitt Romney, a Republican who happens to be a Mormon. Most of the Mormons' victims in the 1857 massacre, who had been heading west to seek a better life in California, were marched single file through the grass and shot at close range, stabbed or beaten to death. Another wagonload of the immigrants, wounded during four days of gun skirmishes with Mormon militiamen and some Paiute Indians, were also shot and killed. For nearly 150 years, the depth of the church's involvement in the massacre has been debated in dozens of books from historians and by the descendants on both sides. Most sensitive is the question of whether Brigham Young, the revered Mormon prophet, knew of or even ordered the killing. The film, released in the US on 22 June and in Britain later this year, will argue that he shared direct responsibility for the attack. Speaking from Los Angeles, Christopher Cain, the film's director and co-writer, told The Observer he was seeking modern resonances. 'I feel that with the religious wars going in the world today, this massacre runs as a close parallel,' he said. 'An incident that took place here brings home what's happening more than something on the other side of the pond. If it's in our own backyard, it's not easier to excuse or accept but it is easier to understand how religious fundamentalism can lead otherwise reasonable men to take violent actions against innocent people.' Cain, whose son, Dean, makes a cameo appearance, acknowledged that the Mormon group had suffered persecution but said this could not excuse their actions. 'Does this mean you march people out single file for a mile and slaughter them like cattle? There are some things which have no justification. Just as there's no justification for a man to strap a bomb on his back and walk into a marketplace in Baghdad to blow himself up. I believe they were acting out religious fanaticism.' Oscar-winner Voight plays a fanatical Mormon bishop, Jacob Samuelson, while the controversial role of Young is taken by Stamp, the British actor who worked with Cain on Young Guns. Cain said: 'We knew there would be conflict regarding Brigham Young's involvement so we tried to use only dialogue taken directly from his speeches and writings. He condemns himself by his own words. If you read his speeches and writings ... there is evidence that links him not only in spirit to the massacre but decisively to the massacre.' Cain says he was helped by a great-granddaughter of Young who has left the church and become a born-again Christian. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which erected a memorial on the massacre site in 1999, maintains Young had no role in the event. Kim Farah, a church spokeswoman, said: 'The weight of historical evidence shows that Brigham Young did not authorise the massacre. This evidence includes a letter that Brigham Young sent telling church members in southern Utah to let the wagon train pass. Unfortunately, the letter arrived two days too late.' She said: 'The Church has no comment on the September Dawn movie.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
