I left Boston comic and Saturday Night Live writer Sam Jay\u2019s UK debut in no doubt of her skill but disappointed by her 50 minutes on stage. The problem isn\u2019t that the two parts of her set \u2013 bawdy first half and satirical second \u2013 don\u2019t dovetail. It\u2019s that her good work up to this point is squandered by anxieties about the audience\u2019s reaction, then by a rambling finale and abrupt exit. It\u2019s true that the reception is quieter than she might be used to in the States. Or at a club night, where the lurid opening section on her queasy memories, as a gay woman, of heterosexual sex (\u201cI\u2019m definitely not a balls-to-butt bitch!\u201d) might raise the roof. But there\u2019s laughter: the devil-may-care attitude and the jokes on her distaste for strap-ons and \u201cdick juice\u201d ensure it. There\u2019s plenty to enjoy when the show takes a cultured turn, too, as Jay offers a comedian\u2019s contrarian stance on #MeToo and Trump, feminism (a white woman\u2019s racket, she claims) and \u201cgay cake\u201d. With the exception of a big-hitting riff on the politics of women peeing, these positions \u2013 while often off-handedly amusing \u2013 are rarely well argued. A routine on \u201cwhite men\u2019s ambition\u201d risks suggesting that other races and genders aren\u2019t as enterprising. Bum notes elsewhere include a routine on Jada Pinkett-Smith, whose UK profile is low. Then there\u2019s the tailspin when Jay interrogates the crowd on its insufficiently vocal response, at which the show haemorrhages momentum. Later, she essays a closing routine on American history which evaporates into incoherence. Jay\u2019s got talent, but on this evidence, not a show. \u2022 At Soho theatre, London, until Saturday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
