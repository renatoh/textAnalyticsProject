The England midfielder is convinced he will fulfil a childhood dream by emulating Emlyn Hughes, Phil Thompson and Graeme Souness in lifting the trophy. Yet he will remind his team-mates before kick-off that this is effectively a chance in a lifetime. \"We have to make sure we don't have any regrets at the final whistle, that we have given every drop when that time comes,\" said Gerrard. \"This is the biggest game of our lives, so we have to give everything we have, and to come back with a winner's medal in the biggest club competition around would mean the world to me. But I will lift that trophy. I know I will. We have world-class players and, believe me, they are in the mood to do this. \"It's so important for the future of Liverpool. Imagine how much that would help us in terms of prestige and attracting top-class players, plus the financial impact it would have. \"This is the ultimate. There will be a lot of pressure to perform but you just have to deal with that. The pressure only comes in big games and that's where you want to be, but maybe there is even more on Milan. I hope they under-estimate us because, if they do, they are in for the shock of their lives.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
