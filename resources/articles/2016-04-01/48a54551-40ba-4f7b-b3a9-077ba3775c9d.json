We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy\u2019s own insights. Here is the latest dilemma \u2013 what are your thoughts? I work in central London but live in Bedfordshire. My commute is about an hour each way. As my husband and I have two children of young school age, I do the school run in the morning while my husband looks after the afternoon pickup. I negotiated a deal with work whereby I don\u2019t start until 10:15am each day and work later. However, over the past year or so the mainline train service I use has become so unreliable that I\u2019m often late, despite leaving in plenty of time \u2013 if the trains ran to timetable I would be at work easily on time. My boss, who lives just 20 minutes from the office, is seemingly unaware of the difficulty of the school run, as well as just how bad the train service is (I don\u2019t think he can believe they are quite so rubbish as they are!). He has suggested I catch an earlier train to arrive at work on time, but this would mean I can\u2019t take the children to school, which I have explained to him. He remains unmoved. My company claims to have a family-friendly policy, and was good enough to agree to the situation as it is, but I now find myself under pressure from a child-free male to dump the children on someone else in order to catch a train 30 minutes earlier than I should have to. How can I negotiate some sort of leniency when it\u2019s the train company\u2019s failure that is making me late? Do you need advice on a work issue?
