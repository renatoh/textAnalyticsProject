It has long been an article of cynical faith that public ownership attracts lower-calibre managers, and gives them no incentive to rise above their miserable selves. The other side of the coin is that private-sector managers, incentivised up to the gills, supposedly use their super talent to superior effect. Substitute these wizards for the public-sector weirdos, said Thatcherite-Majorite-Blairite theory, and wonders would never cease. But they did. The early successes of liberated organisations such as BT and BA in large measure reflected their ludicrously cheap sale. After the massive once-for-all benefits were exhausted, the management magic vanished. Ultimately, an underperforming, pressurised BT lost both its chairman and chief executive. So did GEC-Marconi. Private catastrophes have shattered the management myth just as surely as the public calamities. Marks &amp; Spencer and Ford were once highly respected names in management. Both recently lost CEOs who - one through over-ambition, the other through a lack of it - led their firms down blind alleys. What's going on? Public-sector managers fail partly because they have too little freedom. Private company executives, on the other hand, have too much. The Enron slaughterers murdered the shareholders without let or hindrance. The wreckers of Railtrack, for their sorry part, were placed in an impossibly cramped position (which they promptly made even worse). Politicians, civil servants, investors, passengers and regulators all had different agendas that the managers in the middle of the track couldn't conceivably satisfy. The backdoor, bungled, Byers return to public ownership won't work either, unless the managers are saved from outside interference. They won't be. Their masters will continue to ignore the basically awful economics of a fixed-track transportation system. Try to make it genuinely profitable, and it will spit in your eye. The NHS is an even worse case: it doesn't really exist as a unified, manageable organisation. All the trusts, regional bodies and chief executives can't conceal the fact that it is a complex, disparate collection of inherently uneconomic, freestanding hospitals with loose links to a general practice system that could hardly be more localised. Try to impose central controls on this, and two things must follow: you fail, exacerbating the very ailments you are trying to cure; and you create hugely counterproductive frustration among professionals who need not management, but excellent administration. That distinction strikes to the heart of the public/private debate. It is salutary to recall that MBA stands for Master of Business Administration. The great forerunners of modern management, such as Frederick Taylor, who died with a stop-watch in his hand, or Alfred Sloan, creator of General Motors, were very hot on administration and organisation. But nobody nowadays likes to be called an 'administrator'. This is second-grade stuff, far below the heady heights of strategic, executive management. Yet strategies come and go, usually in step with prevailing fashion. But admin goes on. No matter what the strategic blunders at the top, somebody has to mind the store, or stores. One of M&amp;S's mishaps was that its once-admired admin systems began visibly to slip. But good administrators can be turned into bad ones by a bad set-up. Great administrators are brilliant at putting the right people in the right places to carry out rightly designed tasks. The American prophet of statistical quality control, W Edwards Deming, argued that 85 per cent of all corporate failure stems not from bad workers, but from bad systems. If you don't believe that, just look at Railtrack. Great administrators, moreover, don't practise their arts and crafts superbly because they are incentivised by stock options and the other thrills and spills of private enterprise. The aces administer excellently because that is their pride and their passion. Thus the political faith in private management for public services is absurdly misplaced. True, the profit motive is powerful. But Swiss and Japanese trains run on time because that's what their managers/administrators are paid to achieve. Public services can function perfectly well without entrepreneurs. But both entrepreneurs and administrators will plan more wisely and execute more effectively if they involve their people in the design task. A recent survey, alas, showed that, while all managers agreed that participation improved strategic performance, none actually practised their own preaching. Performance is the issue, not democracy. In 1993 the now-derided Post Office claimed to be the most efficient in Europe, thanks to a programme that led then chief executive Bill Cockburn to boast that his 100,000 postal workers were free 'consultants'. Then the rot returned, and 40,000 'consultants' face the chop. Deming was right. It isn't their fault. 'Public managers bad, private managers good' was always a nonsensical mantra. 'Profit motive good, public service bad' is equal rubbish. Get the objective right (which doesn't mean setting silly targets) and let self-organising administrators administer. Then public service managers can manage as well as private ones. But remember: in too many cases, they could hardly do worse. heller@dircon.co.uk Robert Heller's latest book is 'Roads to Success' (Dorling Kindersley, \u00a325)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
