It's 480 BC, and a small bunch of heroic Spartans have to hold a narrow pass against a squillion Persian invaders. It's all rather modest in comparison with the digitally-enhanced variety, Richard Egan - as Spartan king Leonidas - is slightly less expressive than his shield, and some of it looks as though it were shot one sunny afternoon in Hyde Park. However, it's a stirring tale, efficiently told by old-hand Mat\u00e9. Something To Talk About (Lasse Hallstrom, 1995) 2.55pm, Five Scriptwriter Callie Khouri has Thelma &amp; Louise to her credit but this is a much more mellow, even anodyne, account of a woman's fight to assert herself. The woman is Julia Roberts, a mum and manager of the family's successful stables, and when she finds her husband, good ol' Dennis Quaid, has been cheating on her she heads home to parents Robert Duvall and Gena Rowlands. Most of the sporadic fun comes from Kyra Sedgwick as Roberts' sparky sister. Sister Act (Emile Ardolino, 1992) 3pm, ITV1 Lame farce with Whoopi Goldberg as a nightclub singer hiding out from Harvey Keitel's mob in a convent. Mother Superior Maggie Smith (and they don't come more superior than Maggie) recruits her to jazz up the house choir, and soon they're belting out soul classics - about the best joke in it. Toy Story (John Lasseter, 1995) 6.20pm, BBC1 The Disney film that signalled a new age of computer-generated animation, courtesy of the cutting-edge Pixar studio. There's more to it than the thrill of the whizz-bang special effects, though: the tale of a boxful of abandoned toys struggling for survival is fast, funny, and thoughtful about issues of friendship and loyalty, particularly in the rivalry between long-time fastest gun in town Woody the cowboy and arrogant upstart astronaut Buzz Lightyear. Biloxi Blues (Mike Nichols, 1988) 6.30pm, Five The second instalment of Neil Simon's autobiographical trilogy, following on from Brighton Beach Memoirs: Matthew Broderick plays Eugene Jerome, a young recruit undergoing military training at Biloxi in 1945. Simon's snappy one-liners sit oddly with the coarse realities of boot camp, but it's worth seeing for Christopher Walken's mesmerising, deranged drill sergeant. Chocolat (Lasse Hallstrom, 2000) 9.25pm, BBC2 In 1950s Gascony, the village of Lansquenet is a museum piece, preserved in staunch Catholic values by its stern mayor (Alfred Molina). Then in breezes Juliette Binoche's Mme Rocher to turn the old bakery into a chocolate shop - and at Lent, too. There is a reactionary backlash, but her sweet wiles win over many of the villagers, not to mention the handsome Gypsy down by the river (Johnny Depp). Hallstrom's soft-centred adaptation of Joanne Harris's bestselling novel grows a little sickly, but it's hard to resist. The Shawshank Redemption (Frank Darabont, 1994) 9.25pm, C4 Darabont's film started quietly but grew into the stuff of legend - it seems to climb ever higher in the top 100 movie lists. Maybe that's because although it contains all the cliches of jailbait drama, it breaks free to create a richly emotive and life-affirming tale of comradeship in the harshest conditions. Tim Robbins is accountant Andy Dufresne, convicted of wife-murder in the 1940s, despite protesting his innocence; Morgan Freeman is Red, the fixer, who befriends him at the bestial Shawshank state prison. The Witches Of Eastwick (George Miller, 1987) 10.40pm, ITV1 Jack Nicholson is Daryl Van Horne, \"a horny little devil\" dreamed up by sultry trio Cher, Susan Sarandon and Michelle Pfeiffer to banish their Eastwick ennui; but he proves rather too stimulating. A spellbinding, sexy comedy, retaining the latent threat of John Updike's clever novel, though the overheated finale seems unnecessary. 15 Minutes (John Herzfeld, 2001) 12.05am, C4 Two young east European immigrants arrive in New York, steal a camcorder and record themselves as they go on a murder-and-mayhem spree. Then they try to sell the tape for $1m and the attendant fame... It's a little raw, but Herzfeld's serial killer-thriller-cum-vicious-satire seems almost plausible. It sports an alpha-male cast: Robert De Niro, Edward Burns and Kelsey Grammer, but they're all upstaged by Karel Roden and Oleg Taktarov as the punks. Sunday March 25 Horizons West (Budd Boetticher, 1952) 1.10pm, Five A hard-riding western from the old sagebrush stalwart Boetticher. Set in post-civil war Texas, this has Robert Ryan and Rock Hudson as ex-Confederate brothers who find themselves on opposite sides of the law (Rock the solid marshall, Ryan, as ever, the anti-hero). Raymond Burr is the baddie responsible for splitting the brothers. War, law, loyalty and family, it's all there in a trailblazing 80 minutes. Runaway Bride (Garry Marshall, 1999) 2.50pm, ITV1 Marshall reunites his Pretty Woman co-stars for another light-as-Air Nikes romantic comedy: Julia Roberts is the bogus bride who likes leaving grooms at the altar; Richard Gere the New York journo who scents a good story. There is of course no doubt where the couple are headed, but the decent script and assured performances make it undemanding fun. Stuart Little 2 (Rob Minkoff, 2002) 6.40pm, Five Return of the lovable little rodent from EB White's classic children's story. This is a less gripping yarn than the original, with the orphan mouse-boy (voiced by Michael J Fox) falling for a pretty little bird (Melanie Griffith's Margalo) while an evil falcon (James Woods) hovers menacingly; but the digital animation is picture-perfect and there are droll, tongue-in-cheek performances from Geena Davis and Hugh Laurie as loving parents the Littles. White Men Can't Jump (Ron Shelton, 1992) 10pm, Five Director Shelton, who created an excellent romantic comedy around baseball in Bull Durham, plays a mean game of basketball here. Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson are ace backstreet players in Los Angeles who develop a hustling double-act. Loaded with funny, fancy street insults, it turns a sharp eye on modern American urban realities. Jay And Silent Bob Strike Back (Kevin Smith, 2001) 11.15pm, BBC2 The dopeheads from Smith's earlier films (Clerks, Dogma etc) are rewarded with their own movie, but it's a self-indulgent tale that has the crude duo - Jason Mewes and Smith himself - heading to Hollywood where a movie about them is being shot. It has its droll moments, notably some game self-satirising from Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. Billy Madison (Tamra Davis, 1995) 12midnight, C4 A goofy Adam Sandler comedy, in which he plays a spoiled rich kid who wants to take over the family business: but first he has to repeat his school education in just a few months. This gives Sandler plenty of opportunity for slapstick, not to say infantile humour, as he proves no more grown-up than his schoolmates - until he sets eyes on teacher Bridgette Wilson, that is. Monday March 26 Traffic (Steven Soderbergh, 2000) 11pm, Five Loosely based on the Channel 4 drama, Traffik, this is a superbly gripping and detailed account of the human cost of the narcotics trade. Told in semi-documentary style, it melds several subplots into an outstanding whole: Michael Douglas is the new US drugs tsar who discovers his daughter (Erika Christensen) is a user; Catherine Zeta-Jones is the wife who has to fight for her family when husband Steven Bauer is revealed as a drugs baron; Don Cheadle and Luis Guzman are dedicated DEA agents. But the ace in the pack is Benicio Del Toro as a Tijuana cop fighting the cartel and corrupt bosses. Following on from his Erin Brockovich, it won Soderbergh a best director Oscar. The Astronaut's Wife (Rand Ravich, 1999) 11.05pm, BBC1 Astronaut Johnny Depp returns from a space mission apparently unharmed by a mysterious accident during a two-minute communications black-out. His wife (Charlize Theron), however, begins to notice changes. Soon she becomes pregnant and doesn't know if she's carrying human twins, or a pair of aliens. It is basically a sci-fi Rosemary's Baby, and Theron - in a performance containing many shades of fear, anxiety, and gutsy strength - sports Mia Farrow-style cropped blonde hair. But this is a quieter, slower movie than Polanski's. Tuesday March 27 True Confessions (Ulu Grosbard, 1981) 12.15am, BBC1 Robert Duvall and Robert De Niro as cop-and-priest brothers is a pairing made in heaven, but Grosbard's dark drama never quite lives up to the heady billing. With powerful support from Charles Durning, Burgess Meredith and Cyril Cusack. The seedy tale is as murky as the 1940s Los Angeles in which it is mainly set. Wednesday March 28 The Dead Pool (Buddy Van Horn, 1988) 9pm, Five Clint Eastwood's fifth outing as wayward cop Harry Callahan is no Dirty Harry. With new partner Inspector Quan (Evan C Kim) and a TV reporter (Patricia Clarkson) in tow he hunts a psychopathic killer of celebrities - a trail leading to sleazy film director Liam Neeson. But when you find yourself terrorised by a remote-controlled toy car, it really is time to throw in the badge, Harry. Thursday March 29 Johnny Come Lately (William K Howard, 1943) 12.40pm, C4 Ace reporter James Cagney bowls into town and when a kindly old widow (Grace George) saves him from going to jail on vagrancy charges, he agrees to help save her ailing newspaper. From then on it's hold the front page for a series of splashes about crooked tycoon Ed McNamara and his cronies. The performances are stronger than the worthy script. Friday March 30 Invitation To A Gunfighter (Richard Wilson, 1964) 12.45pm, C4 This serious-minded western fable has George Segal in his first starring role as an embittered Confederate soldier back from the civil war and oppressed by the Unionist townsfolk. When he barricades himself into the house they're trying to cheat him out of, they send for Creole gunslinger Yul Brynner (in a knockout performance) - and find themselves in a heap of trouble. Some lively shoot-outs in among all the moralising."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
