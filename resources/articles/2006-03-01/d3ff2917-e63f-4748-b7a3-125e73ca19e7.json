His mother, who, unlike her husband, had been to university, was a GP, and had appeared in student cabaret as Burlington Bertie. From this fizzing mix of Jewish intellect, social purpose and showbiz panache emerged one of the most attractive and influential figures among the first generation of modern British television. Isaacs, producer of The World at War, the best history series ever made, and first chief executive of Channel 4, the most radical creative act in television's history, has his place assured in British TV's hall of fame, but his value lies in his never exactly having had a career. Rather, as this roving, entertaining, sometimes disjointed memoir reveals, he lurched from job to job, from broadcaster to producer and back to broadcaster. His is the antithesis of the Schlieffen plan careers of BBC director generals such as John Birt or Mark Thompson, or the rough-diamond opportunism of Paul Fox and Greg Dyke. Dangerously imprudent, he has been unembarrassed to wear his intellectual interests, in opera, the arts, history and politics, on his sleeve. Isaacs has never been that interested in television for television's sake. Wherever his ebullient ideas led him, his career followed. Isaacs did his national service in the Royal Scots Fusiliers, where the parade ground had a mirror embedded in the tarmac so that officers could be checked to ensure they wore nothing under their kilts. (This sort of detail suggests that Isaacs would have been rather good at making the sort of smutty Channel 4 entertainment shows he says he abhors.) After Oxford, he found himself at Granada soon after ITV went on air. The best chapters of Look Me in the Eye are an elegy to the lost ambition that was ITV in its first 30 years. Isaacs's hero is Granada's founder, Sidney Bernstein. Bernstein never doubted that TV could be both commercially successful and a weapon for social and cultural emancipation. It was Granada that first televised a by-election, at Rochdale in 1958. Bernstein got the idea for What the Papers Say from the New Yorker. Isaacs was regularly rung by Sidney, who urged him to get his friend Orson Welles to present it. One evening, Isaacs saw a Granada executive taking Auden, Isherwood and Spender by sleeper to Manchester to record a programme. Bernstein cared about television because it could have something to say about the world. His influence is evident through the rest of Isaacs's career. In 1963, Isaacs moved to Rediffusion, the London weekday ITV station, to become editor of This Week, ITV's counterpart to BBC's Panorama. This Week used the power of film over studio, of reportage over presenters. It interviewed Rhodesia's Ian Smith during talks in London; Panorama did not, as the BBC bowed to pressure from Downing Street. As This Week was judged increasingly to be leaving Panorama flat-footed, the BBC poached Isaacs to be Panorama's editor. Eighteen months later it fired him. Isaacs's account of Panorama is the familiar BBC story: interference from on high, internal plotting, the constant smoothing of star presenters' egos, all distracting from the journalism. When Richard Dimbleby died, Isaacs resisted Robin Day's demands to be editor, partly because he could not stand Day's pomposity but also because, rightly, he feared Panorama becoming a purely political, studio-dominated programme. (Day, when reporting from Vietnam, objected to having to talk to a village headman on the front line on the grounds that \"I should not be interviewing anyone of less than cabinet rank\".) So Day conspired to get rid of him. Isaacs was fired by the man who hired him, Paul Fox, head of current affairs. Isaacs never worked at the BBC again and, in escaping its maw, probably ensured his enduring creative success. As Thames's director of programmes, his achievement - Bill Brand, Rock Follies, Rumpole, Edward and Mrs Simpson, The Sweeney and The Naked Civil Servant - outshone the BBC's programmes of the same era. He and the BBC had two further encounters. In 1968, he was asked if he would produce a history of the second world war. Isaacs was enthused, only to find out that, behind his back, the BBC had made others the same offer, and then decided it did not have the money. So he took the idea to his bosses at Thames and went on to make a history series that the BBC has never emulated. In 1987, after the success of Channel 4, Isaacs was interviewed for the post of director general. It didn't go well. \"Mr Isaacs,\" said one governor, \"you don't look to me like a man who takes kindly to discipline. Now I can see by the smile on your face that you take that as a compliment. But I can assure you that I, and others here, see it as a criticism.\" Look Me in the Eye is not a book to read from cover to cover; sometimes it is too much a name check of those Isaacs has worked with. But this in itself reveals something of the man. For Isaacs, unlike most of today's TV chief executives, knows how to make a programme. Programmes are never one person's inspiration but the collective will of passionate, stubborn individual intelligences somehow bonding for a moment to create something more than any one of them alone could have imagined. The chapter on The World at War is a masterly exposition of how documentary series get made - the autonomy of the researcher and producer, the essential genius of the film editor and the creative restraint necessary in the executive producer. Of his greatest creation, Isaacs today writes \"Channel 4, my baby, is not a baby any more\". He recognises that his Channel 4 dates from a now vanished age before television turned into just another market. Isaacs's leap of imagination was to recognise that whereas the BBC and ITV saw its viewers as passive, regular in their habits, expecting more of the same, there was a new generation, not centred on the family, but of individuals, often living alone, who wanted to decide for themselves what to watch. In breaking apart television's claustrophobic corporate culture, and in opening programmes to independent producers, Channel 4 changed British television for ever. It did so at the last moment when it was possible not to be subject to today's inexorable ratings competition of multichannel TV. In the beginning, Isaacs's Channel 4 did not have to raise its own income, it was guaranteed its budget from ITV, which sold its advertising. Channel 4's creative success inevitably led to its breaking free from ITV, but even then Isaacs saw that commercial independence would inevitably change its nature. He is scrupulously generous to those who have followed him but the disappointment is clear in every line. Today, it is doubtful whether a 22-year-old with Isaacs's cultural convictions would readily think of television as a career, certainly no longer at ITV. But Isaacs's passionate argument that the purpose of television is not simply to entertain but to secure the future of an interrogative, informed democracy is one that he makes better than anyone, and he also made the programmes to win it.
