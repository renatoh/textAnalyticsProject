Replete with quotations from Wagner which he subsequently deleted, it was aired by Nagano in a 2002 Barbican concert which impressed with its majestic sweep. Nothing less than 'the juxtaposition of the joys and sorrows of life' is Bruckner's bold aspiration for the last movement, climaxing a titanic second half which grows organically from a more tentative opening. In what will surely prove a landmark performance, Nagano wrings every last nuance from fine German players."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
