But this album is where sentiment clashes with the question of whether she's got what it takes. Boyle has apparently chosen the songs herself - handwritten sleeve notes explain, often movingly, what each track means to her - but her taste runs exclusively to ballads. Is her ringing voice best served by an entire album of tremulous, trickling cover versions, ranging from Cry Me a River, to Madonna's You'll See, to the titular track made famous by Elaine Paige? Of course not. The earnest piano arrangements and Boyle's tender but colourless readings of 12 familiar songs will undoubtedly be bliss to fans of musical theatre; anyone else will be gnawing the sleeve in frustration after five minutes"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
