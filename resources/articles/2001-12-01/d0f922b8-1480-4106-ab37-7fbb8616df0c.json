Total clearances of 136 and 137 in Lee's previous match set the stage for his impressive display, which featured breaks of 64, 119, 53, 73 and 52 as he surged to a 7-1 interval lead. Higgins, after winning the first three events of the season, had neglected practice in favour of spending as much time as possible with his new-born son. His innate class carried him through two matches but his lack of preparation found him out yesterday in the face of formidable opposition. Ken Doherty and Matthew Stevens finished their opening session 4-4 with never more than a frame between them. Doherty's 80 and Stevens' 109 were the highest of their afternoon session. Ronnie O'Sullivan is to play Peter Ebdon and Stephen Hendry will meet Mark Williams in today's quarter-finals. As for McKenzie, the first time he was dismissed he took successful legal action against the governing body, for breach of contract, and its then chairman Rex Williams, for libel. It was widely believed he had not had a fair run in the job. This time even those who supported his return will have fewer regrets that his second tenure of some 14 months has ended. McKenzie's departure follows Mark Wildman's resignation from the chairmanship last week. Most of his fellow directors apparently felt he had given McKenzie and other executives too much rein. There are concerns that money has been spent too freely. The WPBSA, which has its agm on Monday, will receive an annual report putting its costs, in a wrangle that went to the high court, at \u00a31.174m. It still has reserves of \u00a33m but the end of tobacco sponsorship, except for the Embassy World Championship, is only 18 months away by government decree and replacements are hardly rushing to the door. The current UK Championship, which despite nine days' BBC coverage has no sponsor, carries a prize fund of \u00a3746,900. In the perpetual morass of snooker politics it is not always clear who is to blame for what, but there is concern that the WPBSA has still not announced what action it intends to take on the findings of the report this administration commissioned into the previous two. The report by Mark Gay, a lawyer specialising in sport, revealed that the Williams regime operated a network of patronage and favours including, as Gay put it, \"an interesting relationship between voting behaviour and receipt of benevolent-fund grants\". It also confirmed that Williams supporters had been given quasi sinecures on the coaching committee; that excessive expenses had sometimes been run up; and that the membership's funds had been abused in initiating unsuccessful libel actions against critics. Though the Gay report chiefly criticised Williams and his vice-chairman Ray Reardon, a six-times world champion, it also criticised Jim McMahon, a driving instructor, who remains on the board, and Joe Johnson, the 1986 world champion, who joined it last January. A QC's report is believed to have advised there are grounds for action for breach of fiduciary duty in some cases. When McKenzie was dismissed first time round, Hendry declared: \"The game is poisoned from top to bottom.\" There is still poison in the system and the game cannot go significantly forward while it remains."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
