We had a front-row seat as Labour renewed itself to regain the trust of the electorate. We all support the current Labour government with the same level of commitment that we did when the party spent 18 years out of office. Since the local elections this month there has been much talk of Labour's time in government coming to an end, with the Tories now ready for office in the same way Tony Blair's team were over 10 years ago. Nothing in our view could be further from the truth. Tony Blair by 1997 had achieved two fundamental goals: he had not only reconnected his party with the public, but he also outlined an eloquent progressive programme for government, having won the argument for change within the party. David Cameron has only achieved some of the former, has produced comparatively little significant policy and has only papered over cracks within the Tory party. We do not underestimate the government's problems, but 11 years on from 1997, it is still the Labour party which offers the big answers to the big questions facing this country. That is why the prime minister and Labour's talented team of ministers are more than capable of winning the next general election. We wish him the best.

This will be the biggest vote loser of the lot. Just picture the numbers of electors everywhere around the country in the weeks and months ahead meeting regularly at threatened post offices and discussing the impending loss of essential services and of a focal point of a community. It's a gift for the opposition parties. Michael Meadowcroft Leeds Wednesday's proposals in the prime minister's speech that the NHS reform bill will contain provisions to divert funds away from (and possibly close) hospitals rated poorly in patients' surveys are fundamentally flawed. Look at Banbury and Kidderminster. Clinically led plans to downgrade outdated facilities offered at their district general hospitals led in the former to huge demonstrations and in the latter to the unseating of the MP and his replacement with a local doctor. Public opinion always favours local provision over quality of service. Gordon Brown had wanted to keep the NHS off the political radar. He will come to regret his latest U-turn. Ken Harper Manchester When the Bank of England was given responsibility for setting interest rates 11 years ago, inflation was regarded as likely to result from an overheated economy running at overcapacity. But current inflationary pressures are from external sources. Inflation caused by increased world prices for oil and cereals takes money out of the economy and has a deflationary effect. So far, there is little evidence of wage-led inflation. Among other deflationary factors at work are higher mortgage payments, reduced prospects for property equity and lower incomes in finance and property sectors. Trying to reduce inflation through interest rates would not affect the external root causes of that inflation and would only add to the deflationary pressures. In this context, the fiscal effect of the recent income tax reduction is helpful, as would be an interest policy that focused more on maintaining growth than on inflation.
