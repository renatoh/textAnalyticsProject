There's nothing better than lying down the phone about your \"illness \", and then spending eight hours when you should be in the office napping and pottering about the flat. However, it's crucial that you keep up the front when you return to work the next day. At no point do you crack and start being over-elaborate, or offering to make up the time. Your company screws you constantly, so this is just payback. They practically factor this stuff into your wages anyway. Just ride it out with poker face and then flick the Vs at your manager as they walk off. How you certainly don't behave is like the miserable little git in the latest Lemsip advert. Honestly, this guy is such a disgrace to men that by the second viewing I was seriously considering chopping my penis off. We join Steve the Creep while he's being ticked off by his boss for being ill as \"I was really counting on you for that presentation, Steeeeeeeve. \" At this point, , you're itching for him to reply: \"Yeah, sorry. TB. One of those 24-hour things, \" while staring at his computer screen with bored uninterest. But no. The crawling little toad \"surprises \" her by revealing that - dosed up on Lemsip - he did the work from home and emailed it in. As if this wasn't bad enough, he adds that he's arranged to take her for dinner. This guy's problem isn't flu - it's Stockholm syndrome. For all the dignity he's behaving with, he might as well put his balls in a little presentation case and give them to her as an executive toy. Apart from his miserable, willing subjugation, I hate Steve and Lemsip propagating the idea that whenever you're (genuinely) sick you're at risk of losing your job. Enough people are stressed and insecure at work, without Nazi-boss behaviour being further normalised. As a productive member of society, it's your hard-earned right to have the odd day at home binge-eating/ smoking/staring at the ceiling etc. Unless you're a bin man, or a nurse or something, your job can probably wait. It's not that important, and no one really cares whether it gets done today or tomorrow. Seriously."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
