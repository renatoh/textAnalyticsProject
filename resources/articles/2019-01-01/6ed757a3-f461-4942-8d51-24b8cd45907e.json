In a newspaper interview on Thursday, Jean Wyllys said he was currently outside of Brazil and had no plans to return after a growing number of threats over the past year. Wyllys, who was re-elected in October and had been set to begin a third term in February, was a close friend of Marielle Franco, the gay Rio councilwoman who was shot and killed along with her driver in March. His departure is likely to add to fears among Brazil\u2019s LGBT community that homophobia is set to rise even further under the government of president Jair Bolsonaro, who has won notoriety for his overt homophobia. In the interview, Wyllys said his decision to leave wasn\u2019t because of Bolsonaro\u2019s rise, but rather the climate of heated rhetoric and intensifying violence toward members of the LGBT community in the wake of last year\u2019s heated election campaign. Bolsonaro made no explicit comment on Wyllys\u2019s announcement, but soon after posted a thumbs-up emoji on his twitter feed. Bolsonaro\u2019s son Carlos \u2013 also a Rio city councilman \u2013 greeted the news with a tweet saying: \u201cGo with God and be happy.\u201d Wyllys told the Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper that the decision had been a painful one, but he asked: \u201cWhy would I want to live four years of my life in an armoured car with bodyguards? Four years of my life when I can\u2019t just go where I want to go?\u201d Wyllys first found national fame when he won Brazil\u2019s version of Big Brother, and went on to become one of the country\u2019s most high-profile advocates for gay rights \u2013 a role which led to frequent attacks from the religious right. \u201cIt is a difficult battle to fight. Sometimes I feel like Don Quixote, you know?\u201d he told the Guardian in 2012. \u201cBut this is my vocation. My calling. I feel that I need to be here.\u201d Wyllys said that the former Uruguayan president Pepe M\u00fajica had advised him to take the death threats seriously. \u201cHe told me: \u2018Take care, man. Martyrs are not heroes.\u2019 And he\u2019s right: I don\u2019t want to sacrifice myself,\u201d Wyllys said. In Congress, Wyllys was frequently at odds with Bolsonaro, a congressman for 28 years with a long history of homophobic, racist and sexist comments. In their most notorious public clash, Wyllys spit towards Bolsonaro on the floor of the lower House of Deputies after Bolsonaro dedicated his vote to impeach then-president Dilma Rousseff to a dictatorship-era torturer. In a tweet on Thursday, Wyllys said: \u201cPreserving a threatened life is also a strategy to fight for better days. We did a lot for the common good. And we will do much more when new times come.\u201d Despite Brazil\u2019s image as an inclusive nation that is home to the world\u2019s largest gay parade, homophobia is rampant, and often violent. In 2017, at least 445 LGBT Brazilians died as victims of homophobia \u2013 a 30% increase from 2016."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
