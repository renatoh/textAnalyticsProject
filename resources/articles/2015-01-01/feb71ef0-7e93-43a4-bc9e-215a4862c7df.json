A long pass from Cesc F\u00e1bregas, intended to send a static Diego Costa sprinting behind the Newcastle United defence, sailed away for a goal-kick midway through the first half and the Chelsea manager leapt from the dugout to remonstrate with his striker about his lack of movement. Shouting at Costa is a brave thing to do at the best of times. He is not blessed with the longest of fuses but then again neither is Mourinho when he sees his \u00a332m striker performing a passable impression of Fernando Torres and his team playing without any intensity against Newcastle at home. The visitors were dominating and creating chances and Chelsea looked like they were still reeling from the defeat at Tottenham Hotspur on New Year\u2019s Day. Slowly but surely Chelsea dragged themselves out of their torpor and by the end, with victory assured after goals from Oscar and Costa, Mourinho was relaxed enough to turn his attention away from the action and on to John Carver\u2019s employment status. If Newcastle continue to play as well as they did in the first half, then Carver has an outside chance of being upgraded from caretaker to permanent manager. \u201cHe said to me, \u2018if you keep playing like this you\u2019ll get a five-year contract as Newcastle manager\u2019,\u201d Carver said. \u201cIt was nice. At the end of the game he said, \u2018you deserve the job, you\u2019re ready for it now. He said \u2018I hope you get it\u2019. We just laughed and he gave me another hug \u2013 he must have hugged me 10 times today.\u201d Carver has not spoken to Newcastle\u2019s owner, Mike Ashley, yet and R\u00e9mi Garde is rumoured to top the list of likely replacements for Alan Pardew. The caretaker really wants that job, even though he has not won any of his three matches in charge. \u201cWe\u2019ve got Southampton next Saturday, then we\u2019re not playing the following week because we\u2019re out of the FA Cup, so there is a little bit of time there,\u201d Carver said. \u201cIt\u2019s been two weeks now, so by that time it will be a month. That\u2019s a long time to decide what you are going to do, so I think it should be in place by then.\u201d Chelsea were too powerful in the end and moved two points clear at the top after Manchester City drew with Everton. Oscar gave them the lead shortly before half-time after capitalising on some quick thinking by Willian and Branislav Ivanovic at a corner and the Brazilian\u2019s magnificent backheel set up Costa for Chelsea\u2019s second goal after 59 minutes. It was a slog at times, though, and Mourinho had strong words for his players at half-time. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have enough players playing at the level we\u2019re used to seeing,\u201d Mourinho\u2019s assistant, Steve Holland, said. \u201cJos\u00e9 reminded them at half-time what he wanted them to do, their roles and responsibilities. We wanted to play higher up the pitch. We wanted the ball more, recover the ball more, sustain attacks. Mentally dominate the game, which we didn\u2019t do very well in the first half. The players responded well and it was a very good second half.\u201d Holland was speaking because Mourinho did not turn up for his post-match press conference. He was charged with misconduct by the Football Association last week following comments about an apparent campaign against Chelsea \u2013 they were denied another penalty when Fabricio Coloccini got away with handling Costa\u2019s cross in the 55th minute \u2013 and the club are backing his stance. Yet Chelsea did not need any favours from the officials to beat Newcastle. A few tweaks and some constructive criticism from Mourinho was all it took for them to rediscover their spark. \u201cThey have to be psychologists at times,\u201d Holland said. \u201cThey have to recognise what is required at the time and get the necessary reaction. That\u2019s why the top managers are the top managers. Jos\u00e9 got the reaction he wanted in the second half. It was a collective thing. Not individuals. It was a general, collective half-time team talk. \u201cIt gets mentioned quite a bit, blip, playing poorly, but we\u2019ve played 31 matches and we\u2019ve lost two. We\u2019re top of the league in one of the hardest leagues in the world, two points clear, we\u2019re in the round of 16 of the Champions League, we\u2019re in the semi-finals of the Capital One Cup and the fourth round of the FA Cup. So it\u2019s not so bad, eh?\u201d Man of the match Oscar (Chelsea)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
