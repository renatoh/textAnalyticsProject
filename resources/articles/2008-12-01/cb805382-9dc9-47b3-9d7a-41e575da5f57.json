And commentators on the far right are decrying Obama's appointments as shrewd Machiavellian positioning, insinuating Obama's ultimate goal is not righting the ship, but ensuring his own political survival come 2012. As in most things political, those occupying the outliers on either side of the spectrum are wrong. Obama's appointments are neither petty political manoeuvring, nor a betrayal of his true believers. Not since 1933 has an incoming president faced such monumental challenges in such unsure times. Thus far, Obama's cabinet appointments reflect the historic nature of his incoming administration. He has built a meritocratic cabinet of intellectual heavyweights, where reason, debate and consensus will govern his administration. The president-elect has refused to play to the gallery of his core supporters, but also refused to make symbolic, bi-partisan appointments. The announcement that Robert Gates would stay on as secretary of defence was welcomed by security pragmatists and hawks alike. Gates has overseen a complete reversal of fortunes in Iraq, and he is certainly the best man to finish the job. Keeping Gates in the cabinet also sends strong signals to the Pentagon that Democrats are tired of their second-tier reputation with the military establishment, and are ready to get serious about security. Given the ugliness of their summer contest, there is still disbelief over Hillary Clinton's appointment as secretary of state. While it is tempting to interpret the move as politically motivated, the fact remains that Clinton is a significant force. Questions remain about how effectively the two will maintain an air-tight relationship \u2013 a must for successful foreign policy \u2013 but her abilities are unquestionable. Complementing Gates and Clinton will be Obama's national security adviser, retired Marine General James L Jones \u2013 a man known more for his ties to Senator John McCain than to the president-elect. Jones' appointment is a strong one and it should serve to revive the National Security Council, which was all but dissolved under the Bush administration. While it is reassuring to see the president-elect taking a pragmatic line on security, the economy will take priority. Obama is wasting little time. The Times has already dubbed Obama's economic team \"the Robert Rubin Memorial All-stars\", after the pro-business and anti-regulation former treasury secretary under President Clinton. Tim Geithner, a former protege of Rubin's, has been given the keys to the treasury. And Rubin, along with Larry Summers \u2013 a man that Henry Kissinger once said should have a permanent White House office \u2013 will serve as Obama's chief economic advisers. It's arguable that all share some culpability in the current financial quagmire, but they remain three of the top minds in economic and financial policy, and are well-placed to find a way out the mess they helped create. Rounding out Obama's cabinet appointments are health secretary Tom Daschle, attorney general Eric Holder, homeland security secretary Janet Napolitano and commerce secretary Bill Richardson. The last crucial piece in the cabinet puzzle will be Obama's education secretary. The majority of public educators are still fuming at Bush's No Child Left Behind initiative. The incoming president will need to appoint an educational reformer with top credentials. But given his appointments thus far, education should be in very capable hands. On January 20, Team Obama will hit the ground running and the countdown clock to 100 days will begin. Public expectations are nearing unreachable levels, but with the administration assembled thus far, Obama is giving himself every chance to make significant strides within that crucial, but small, benchmark."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
