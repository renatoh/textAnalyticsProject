The huge painting was created to honour Mike Jones, who started volunteering at the RNLI in New Brighton on the Wirral in 1980 when he was just 18. Painted by the Australian graffiti artist Smug One, the Unsung Heroes mural covers the side of a house on Virginia Road in New Brighton meaning Jones, depicted wearing a life jacket, is looking out towards the Irish Sea. \u201cIt\u2019s very humbling,\u201d Jones told the PA news agency. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing, but it\u2019s nice.\u201d Jones, who works in a school, said he has been a fan of boats since he was a child and one of the reasons he enjoys the role is \u201cthe toys we play with\u201d. However, he said one of the main draws is the people he has met along the way. \u201cIt\u2019s helping other people, and the teamwork \u2013 the camaraderie of the crews,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody works together as a team, one big team all the time. It\u2019s one big family.\u201d Ian Thornton, operations manager at New Brighton Lifeboat station, said: \u201cThis is a fantastic and fitting tribute to an amazing person who has volunteered for 40 years with the RNLI. \u201cDue to the location of the mural, Mike will always be looking out to sea to keep an eye on what\u2019s going on.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
