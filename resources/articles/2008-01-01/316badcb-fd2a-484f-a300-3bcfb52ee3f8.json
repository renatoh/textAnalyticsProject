While followers of the movie version know the character is single with a sweetheart, as far as comic book fans are concerned Spider-Man has been married to Mary Jane Watson for the past 21 years. Now, in a plot twist by the publishers Marvel, Spider-Man, known otherwise as Peter Parker, and Mary Jane, make a deal with the devil-like villain Mephisto. The story, in Spider-Man comic number 545, sees the couple's marriage annulled in return for the life of Peter's Aunt May, of late stuck in a deep coma. Suddenly, Peter is once again a 20-something bachelor, nerdy, living with his elderly aunt - and single. His marriage has been, in fact, erased from everyone's memory. Mephisto says that he is offering the deal, in which Spider-Man's identity is also made secret again, because Parker's relationship with Mary Jane \"is the rarest love of all\", a bond that is \"pure, unconditional and made holy in the eyes of He who I hate most\". Mephisto says: \"A love like yours comes about but once in millennia and to take that away from Him ... is a victory like none other imaginable.\" Marvel claims that a married Spider-Man made life difficult for its writers and had been a source of regret ever since the couple's big day in 1987. According to an interview with Comic Book Resources, Marvel Comics' editor-in-chief, Joe Quesada, said: \"At the end of the day my job is to keep these characters fresh and ready for every fan that walks through the door ... while also planning for the future and hopefully an even larger fan base.\" Spider-Man was created by Stan Lee and the artist Steve Ditko, first appearing in August 1962. The hero, while still at school, gains his extraordinary powers after being bitten by a radioactive spider in a science demonstration. Following Marvel's latest move, fans are objecting to the \"continuity issues\" created by the volte face, saying the change may have the opposite effect to Quesada's aim. A writer on the Comics Should be Good web forum says: \"Cloned Spidey? It sucked, but I accepted it and I could explain it to a non-comics reader in a couple of sentences. Mephisto erases memories and changes continuity? Well, that's a harder one swallow and to explain.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
