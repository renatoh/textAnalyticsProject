In an interview with BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Green vowed to \u201cget to work, grasp this new marketplace and get on with the job\u201d to get Arcadia back on track. The company owns the Topshop, Burton, Dorothy Perkins, Topman, Wallis, Evans, Outfit and Miss Selfridge chains. Green said: \u201cThe marketplace \u2026 has fundamentally changed forever. Whether we haven\u2019t changed quickly enough or we had too many shops or whatever, I think it\u2019s a combination of a lot of things. The answer is you can\u2019t get it all right. For a long time the company made a lot of money. Literally only in the last couple of years it fell off.\u201d As part of Wednesday\u2019s rescue deal, Arcadia pledged to spend \u00a3135m on a turnaround plan, including \u00a375m in revamping dowdy stores and \u00a360m in improving its online operations in order to raise its game against rivals such as Asos, Primark and H&amp;M. The entrepreneur said the British public did not trust him because the media \u201cmake them all fucking jealous, it\u2019s quite basic. These people writing all this shit couldn\u2019t spell 50 quid. They all get jealous. The fact that someone can actually write out a cheque and writes one out, people don\u2019t like it\u201d. Green paid \u00a3363m payment into the BHS pension fund in 2017 after coming under pressure from the Pensions Regulator. The family also paid themselves a \u00a31.2bn dividend from Arcadia in 2005, the biggest corporate payout in British history. \u201cThat was 14 years ago,\u201d Green said in the BBC interview. Green, who was long known as the king of the high street, has faced a barrage of criticism in recent years for pursuing a lavish lifestyle on his yacht in Monaco while his retail empire struggled. His other retail acquisition, BHS, went bust in 2016, a year after he sold it to a former bankrupt for \u00a31. He denied that Arcadia had come close to collapse, despite the fact that documents sent to creditors who voted on the CVA stated that the group was \u201chighly likely, either immediately or after a short time period, to enter into insolvent administration or liquidation\u201d, if the CVA did not go ahead. Green said: \u201cIt didn\u2019t come close to collapse \u2013 we won the vote. It was a legitimate vote and it was won. Many more landlords clearly voted yes than no.\u201d Landlords of its 570 UK standalone stores approved the complex rescue plan on Wednesday, avoiding a collapse into administration that would have threatened 18,000 jobs. At least 23 stores will close in about four months\u2019 time unless the CVA is challenged by creditors within the next 28 days. A further 25 are set to close as part of a wider restructuring plan in which the property arms of Miss Selfridge and Evans are being being put into administration. Property sources say dozens more stores could close within a year as, under the terms of the CVA, landlords subject to rent cuts have the right to turf Arcadia out if they can get better rents from a new tenant. The creditors\u2019 meeting had been adjourned last week. To win over landlords, the Green family offered to put up about \u00a39.5m a year over three years to reduce rent cuts for landlords to 25%-50%, from the 30% to 70% previously planned. Green\u2019s Monaco-based wife, Tina, who is the official owner of Arcadia, also agreed to pump \u00a3100m into the pension scheme over three years. That cash injection is on top of \u00a3285m of cash and assets that Arcadia itself has agreed to put into the fund. Green told the BBC: \u201cYou don\u2019t want to end up having a car crash, do you? You don\u2019t want to be in business and then see an ugly car crash and all the people out of work and you could have assisted, for however you got there, to rescue the business. Why would you want to see that?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
