In the new film Mari, Bobbi Jene Smith plays a dancer who discovers she\u2019s pregnant just as she is choreographing her first big show. After the shoot, Smith became pregnant herself, and now must face some of the same challenges to her character. When I Skype the dancer in her New York apartment, she looks suitably glowing in the laptop\u2019s wan light. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m glowing!\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m pretty tired. I can tell my body\u2019s telling me: slow down.\u201d Smith has been dancing almost every day since childhood. She left home in Iowa for ballet boarding school in Canada at 11, studied at New York\u2019s Juilliard and spent a decade with the company Batsheva in Israel, where she gained a reputation as a fearless performer of full-bodied commitment. She relocated to New York in 2014 (as chronicled in the award-winning documentary Bobbi Jene) and has tirelessly worked to build her own career as a choreographer. To suddenly stop dancing can be a shock to the body, the psyche and a dancer\u2019s sense of identity, but also their career trajectory \u2013 especially in New York\u2019s very competitive, very precarious dance world. \u201cI\u2019ve been working towards this point, and now to take some time off, it\u2019s scary,\u201d says Smith. \u201cIt is a fast pace and people forget easily.\u201d So if you take too much time out you\u2019ll lose momentum, your profile? \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true, but it feels like that,\u201d she says. \u201cBut if it sets me back a bit, I\u2019ll just keep going.\u201d Mari is the meditative debut feature from British writer/director Georgia Parris. Smith\u2019s character Charlotte contemplates the tensions between motherhood, creative ambition and family responsibilities as her grandmother lies dying in hospital. The dance in the film paints moods and inner lives, as well as plot, and is choreographed by Punchdrunk associate director Maxine Doyle. Charlotte\u2019s pregnancy is the unexpected result of a fling with a younger dancer. For Smith, it was rather more planned. She is married to fellow dancer Or Meir Schraiber, whom she met at Batsheva. \u201cIn Charlotte\u2019s case the pregnancy came as a shock, and for me it was a very beautiful realisation,\u201d says Smith. Was the physical reality of pregnancy anything like she\u2019d imagined when she was acting the part? \u201cIt\u2019s actually pretty similar, surprisingly,\u201d says Smith. \u201cIt\u2019s like, oh, I\u2019ve acted like I\u2019ve felt this way and now I feel like that!\u201d Dancers, more than the rest of us mortals, are in touch with their physical selves. \u201cIt\u2019s scary and amazing,\u201d says Smith of her changing body. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole lesson in letting go.\u201d She\u2019s spent her life fine-tuning the control of her body, \u201cand now I can\u2019t control it!\u201d she laughs. \u201cIt controls me. But also, I mean, I have another heart beating inside of me. It\u2019s unreal, it\u2019s magic.\u201d At six months pregnant, Smith is still dancing. She just premiered her biggest work to date, Lost Mountain, performing with a visible bump. \u201cHer first performance!\u201d Smith says of her daughter-to-be. She and Schraiber danced a \u201chopeful parents\u201d duet. \u201cI made sure not to do anything that would make the audience worry for me,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t want them to think \u2018Who\u2019s that irresponsible woman?\u2019 The doctor says it\u2019s OK to keep dancing but I\u2019m taking it easy.\u201d It\u2019s after the baby is born that the real challenge begins. As a freelance dancer in the US, Smith has no maternity entitlement. (In the UK, freelance workers can apply for state maternity allowance, up to \u00a3148.68 per week, for nine months.) Her husband is freelance too. What do you do? \u201cYou try to save up, and get back to work as fast as you can,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd be thankful for family and friends to help.\u201d When birth itself is so unpredictable, never mind life with a baby, and the job of a dancer so physically demanding, it\u2019s impossible to know when \u201cas fast as you can\u201d will be. \u201cEvery birth is so different and I have no idea what to expect,\u201d says Smith. \u201cSome moms are back in the studio in two weeks and some people need a whole year. We have to figure that out together, my husband and I, how it\u2019s going to work, but for sure it\u2019s scary.\u201d Some choreographers take their children into the studio and on tour. Some dancers who have children move away from performing to teaching or other more steady careers. Smith has no doubt that she will return to dancing. \u201cEvery woman that I\u2019ve seen come back from giving birth dances even better, with more heart and clarity,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I\u2019m not scared of that part.\u201d Do you think it will change you as an artist? She smiles. \u201cI hope it does.\u201d \u2022 Mari is in UK cinemas on 21 June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
