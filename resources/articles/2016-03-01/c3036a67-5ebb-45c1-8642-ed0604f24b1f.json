I haven\u2019t endorsed him or anything like that. But I also think: he\u2019s an evangelical Christian, and probably one of the worst ones when it comes to trans issues.\u201d Last year, the Texas senator called the federal government\u2019s support for gender-neutral bathrooms for trans students \u201clunacy\u201d. Jenner, of Keeping Up With the Kardashians fame and one of the most visible transgender women in the world, has often been criticized for her own lack of understanding of trans issues. Thanks to her money, fame and years of privilege as a successful white male athlete, her experience does not mirror that of most trans people. However, Jenner offered to be a \u201ctrans ambassador\u201d for Cruz, with all the girls from her show I Am Cait \u2013 the second season of which begins on Sunday \u2013 sitting on a trans issues advisory board. \u201cYes, trans ambassador to the president of the United States, so we can say: \u2018Ted, love what you\u2019re doing, but here\u2019s what\u2019s going on,\u2019\u201d Jenner said. Jenner acknowledged that most trans people are Democrats, but said she was a proud Republican. \u201cNumber one,\u201d she said, \u201cif we don\u2019t have a country, we don\u2019t have trans issues. We need jobs. We need a vibrant economy. I want every trans person to have a job,\u201d she said. Trans activist Cherno Biko told the Guardian Jenner\u2019s political comments were \u201cdangerous\u201d, after last year saw the highest rates of murder of trans and non-gender conforming people on record. \u201cWe simply cannot afford to have Caitlyn Jenner supporting people who hate us,\u201d said Biko, 24, co-chair of the Young Women\u2019s Advisory Council for the city of New York. \u201cAnd if she continues down this road, she will have blood on her hands. \u201cHer being a Republican. Her not supporting marriage equality. Being negative about people needing income support. You can\u2019t do all of that and them claim to be an ambassador for a community that you can\u2019t represent.\u201d Biko suggested how Jenner\u2019s help was in fact most needed. \u201cWe don\u2019t need your help in the way that you\u2019re doing it now,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need your money.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
