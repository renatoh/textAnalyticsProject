More women taking positive leadership roles in our society. More women full stop. I know we're doing pretty well: I know we only got the vote a while ago, were only taught to read a while ago, only allowed to publish under our own names a while ago, etc. We've come a long way, baby, but ... I watch the news from parliament and see a majority of suits and ties, minority of kitten heels. I flick through the Radio Times and see that the vast majority of writers, directors and producers are men. I listen to I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue, The News Quiz, watch Have I Got News For You - all three favourites of mine - and there are always more male voices than female. I know that most editors of our national newspapers are men. I walk into our major theatres and know the majority of those buildings are run by men, often doing work primarily by male writers. Very many of my best friends are men. I like them, like their work, like their company, and I certainly don't believe that a world dominated by women (as it is, currently, by men) would be any better. But a world where women could see ourselves in public, in prominent and valued roles, would be different. Wider. Fuller. We ALL bring different perspectives and the larger the range of perspectives offered - in politics, arts, daily life - the better-off we'll all be. And this certainly isn't all men's fault. Too many women are satisfied with the basic goals of feminism: more or less equal pay, more or less equal representation, more or less lack of overt discrimination. We've lost sight of the possibility of seeing ourselves taking responsibility on a bigger stage. We're great at doing it for our families and friends, but the planet's in a bit of a state right now. It needs all of us stepping up. It might take a bit more effort, it's not that easy - if it was, it would have happened already, but I reckon it might be about time. Fourth-wave feminism anyone?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
