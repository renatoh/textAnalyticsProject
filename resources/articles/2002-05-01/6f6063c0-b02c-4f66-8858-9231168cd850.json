With a crop of specialist gourmet hotels springing up all over the country, you can dine like a king if you know where to go. 'You expect just to get haggis in Scotland,' says Scottish chef of the year, Scott Dougall from the Craigsanquhar Hotel. 'But you'll find more and more good food here now. After all, we have the best fresh produce right on our doorstep, from fish to meat and vegetables.' Here's our pick of six of the best foodie hotels north of the border: PEAT INN Cupar, Fife (01334 840 206) www.thepeatinn.co.uk It's easy to imagine yourself in France as your tastebuds are tantalised by the three-course set menu in this five-star restaurant with rooms. That's because owner and chef David Wilson, who has travelled widely in France, has tried to recreate what top restaurants there have done to attract people from miles away - providing accommodation for them. It's certainly worth travelling miles to this hamlet, which seems to be in the middle of nowhere despite its proximity to St Andrews, to eat in the former coach house complete with the smell of woodsmoke. Don't miss the little pots of chocolate and rosemary - though before getting to them, you might find yourself eating delicacies such as halibut on vegetable risotto followed by guinea fowl casserole with red wine and vegetables. The restaurant has three AA rosettes, but the eight rooms aren't treated as an afterthought here; the modern split-level suites in a small building at the back are very inviting after a hard evening's eating. Price: Double suites with breakfast - including home-made croissants and venison - cost \u00a3145. A three-course set lunch with coffee and petits fours is \u00a319.50, with a three-course set dinner \u00a328 and an \u00e0 la carte menu \u00a333. AIRDS HOTEL, Port Appin, Argyll (01631 730 236) www.airds-hotel.comairds-hotel.com A converted eighteenth-century ferry inn overlooking Loch Linnhe, this small family-run hotel boasts a clutch of awards, including a Michelin star and three AA rosettes. The proof of the pudding is in the eating here, where fresh seafood and game is incorporated into a menu that typically might feature ravioli of langoustine, roast squab pigeon with foie gras and wild mushrooms, and raspberry and Drambuie ice cream. An added bonus comes with the comprehensive wine list. Afterwards, drag yourself into the inviting drawing-rooms with open fires and flowers, which provide the perfect spot to collapse in after a little over indulgence. The most sought after of the 12 antique-furnished bedrooms have a spectacular loch and mountain view, and outside there are plenty of inviting walks where guests can walk off the excesses of the meal the night before. Price: Dinner, bed and breakfast \u00a3150 or \u00a3135 in a small room. SUMMER ISLES HOTEL, Achiltibuie, Ullapool (01854 622 282) www.summerisleshotel.co.uk The hotel's directions to go north of Ullapool along a 'twisting single track road' which leads after 15 miles to a 'straggle of white cottages gazing over the bay at the Summer Isles and beyond to the Hebrides' tells you what splendid isolation you will be in if you choose to stay here. You will share that isolation- with associated fishing, walking, bird- and seal-watching and glorious beaches - with tables heaving with home-made and locally caught produce. Seafood is obviously a speciality here, and only hours after it has been caught, it is turned into an array of dishes by former Scottish chef of the year Chris Firth-Bernard, who has also won a Michelin star. The five-course set dinner is served at 8pm and might begin with a goat's cheese starter followed by Aberdeen beef carpaccio, seared scallops with leeks, hazelnut and strawberry meringue torte, and an impressive cheese trolley. The 13 rooms are decorated in a rustic, but comfortable fashion, and include a log cabin and a cottage. No children under six are allowed. Price: \u00a353.50 B&amp;B per person without a sea view, though the scenery means it's worth the \u00a367 charged for a sea view. Dinner costs \u00a341 per head . BOATH HOUSE, Auldearn, Nairn (01667 454 896) www.boath-house.com It's no surprise that this beautiful Georgian mansion set in 20 acres with its own lake won a Good Hotel Classic Country House 2002 award. The bonus is that the beautiful setting makes the perfect backdrop for the gastronomic delights that await in the restaurant; a typical five-course meal starts with a tomato and basil soup with hot smoked salmon and caviar followed by foie gras and fresh figs, halibut on a white-bean puree with chorizo sausage, cheese with pear and rocket salad and hot chocolate cake with pistachio ice cream and strawberries. If you get a conscience attack afterwards, there is a health and beauty suite in the basement. The seven bedrooms are all individually furnished with antiques, but it's worth paying a little extra for the two superior rooms; number four has a four-poster bed with views of both the lake and the walled herb and vegetable garden while number three has a bathroom the same size as the bedroom. Price: \u00a375 per person with breakfast, including locally made black pudding and specially made organic pork sausages, in a standard double, or \u00a3100 in a superior double. A five-course dinner costs \u00a338. THREE CHIMNEYS, Colbost, Isle of Skye (01470 511 258) www.threechimneys.co.uk With the look of a simple B&amp;B from the outside, this old crofter's cottage on the shores of Loch Dunvegan in the remote north-west of the Isle of Skye is now one of Scotland's most acclaimed restaurants with rooms and has a five-star tourist board rating. The restaurant is the focal point of the croft, and is a cosy place to munch through the selection of mouth-watering meals made from local seafood, meat and vegetables, with home-made breads. Owner Shirley Spear's hot marmalade pudding with Drambuie custard is so sought after she says she hasn't been able to take if off the menu in 18 years. If you've digested that by breakfast time, there are bowls of creamy porridge and smoked duck and venison to start the day on. The six bedrooms are in a separate building and all have a sea view and plenty of space to sit and appreciate it. Price: \u00a3175 per room including breakfast. A three-course dinner is \u00a337. CRAIGSANQUHAR HOTEL Cupar, Fife (01334 653 426) www.craigsanquhar.com Stay here and it won't take you long to realise why Scott Dougall won Scottish chef of the year. Yes, there is haggis on the menu, but it's a delicious part of the full Scottish breakfast that can include porridge (without lumps) and fresh kippers. Make sure you get plenty of exercise in the day to work up an appetite for Dougall's signature starter dish - a terrine of ham, duck confit and foie gras followed by a lip-smacking main course such as roast filet of beef with braised oxtail and fried quail's egg, and to-die-for warm chocolate pudding with cherry compote. Everything served up by the kilt-clad waitresses is made here, from the bread to the ice cream and petits fours. The 13 rooms in this nineteenth-century, creeper-clad mansion set in its own grounds - just six miles from St Andrews - are, for the main part, large with period furniture and supplies of fresh tea and coffee. If you fancy something stronger, there are strategically placed trays of brandy, whisky and port in the upper corridors and plenty of comfy chairs dotted around in which to sup them. Price: \u00a3150 per standard room, B&amp;B, or \u00a3175 per deluxe room (ask for number five). A three-course table d'h\u00f4te dinner is \u00a328, or pay \u00a330 for a six-course gastronomic tasting delight."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
