Yes, no and yes. I'm often asked questions like this, particularly by people who have just bought a last-minute flight and suddenly realise they may need to queue at an embassy before leaving. The easiest place to find out is the excellent and absorbing Foreign &amp; Commonwealth website. I want to go diving in Israel and then travel to Syria and Jordan. Several Arab League countries won't let you in if you have an Israeli stamp in your passport. Bear in mind that it will stay there until the passport expires, and ripped-out pages make immigration officials very suspicious. What's the best currency to carry in the Russian Federation? US dollars, says the FCO, and they should be in pristine condition. But bear in mind that accounts can't be settled using dollars in cash. I'm only going to the Maldives... But did you know that nudity (including topless sunbathing) is against the law? Is it safe to go on safari in Zimbabwe? It's probably better avoided. Even waving can apparently be misinterpreted, as an open hand is a symbol of one of the main political parties. Is nowhere safe? Denmark is fairly calm. (\"Drivers should, however, beware of cyclists and always remember to look over their shoulder before turning corners,\" warns the FCO). Iraq? Don't even think about it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
