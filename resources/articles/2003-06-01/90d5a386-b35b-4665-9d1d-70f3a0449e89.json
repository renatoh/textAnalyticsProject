Sven-Goran Eriksson will have had eyes only for the dates and for him there is no thrill at all. The England coach met with a predictable disappointment over scheduling that disregards the aspirations of the national team. Assuming they have qualified for Euro 2004 there will be a firestorm of patriotism and emotion next summer over England's prospects, but this continues to be a country that daydreams about success instead of scheming to achieve it. Eriksson will not be able to prepare for the tournament as he would wish. The Premiership will start on August 16 and wind its way to a close on the weekend of May 15, with the FA Cup final to follow seven days later. There will then be a gap of only three weeks before the hosts Portugal kick off Euro 2004 in Oporto on June 12. Even that period will not be entirely clear if there is a Premiership club in the European Cup final in Gelsenkirchen on May 26. It will be hard for England to gather their powers before trying for their first honour in 38 years. Eriksson knows how elusive the trophies are. His men were plodders in mind and body when losing to Brazil in the World Cup last year, and the coach was not only issuing excuses when he pinned some of the blame on the lingering weariness inflicted by the Premiership programme. The prospects in Japan would have been enhanced if an arduous campaign at their clubs had not left Steven Gerrard, Gary Neville and others unfit to play for the national team. Any compromises have been one-sided, with Eriksson placating managers by substituting every member of the line-up at the interval in the now notorious friendly match with Australia. Despite the uproar and the allegations that he was bringing international football into disrepute, he is adamant that he will act in a similar fashion in future. His sympathetic attitude towards the clubs is not being reciprocated. The Swede had recently called for a significant pause prior to Euro 2004. \"Hopefully, if we qualify, this time we will have four weeks between the FA Cup final and the start of the tournament, even if I doubt it will happen,\" he said. \"It's a real fact, though, that if we go on playing football like this with so many games, we are more or less dead at the end of the season.\" Eriksson had no expectation of persuading the administrators, and his main aim will have been to put his objections on record. It is disturbing to reflect that the coach may already be making his case in anticipation of the furore that will ensue if England flounder in Portugal. Everyone is adopting a customary stance, with the usual murmurs of regret from the authorities. \"It is a perennial issue, unfortunately,\" said the Premier League spokesman Dan Johnson, \"but we have done the fixtures as tightly as possible. It is also a European issue. We have to fit in with Champions League and Uefa Cup dates, and international fixtures. We don't set those dates. \"There are less Champions League fixtures this year but more European weeks because they are alternating the Champions League with the Uefa Cup. We have also got to cater for the FA Cup and the League Cup.\" The principal problem that defeats the planners and bedevils Eriksson is, in essence, the bloated nature of the Premiership. It contains 20 clubs, whereas the top leagues in Italy and Germany have only 18 members, with room for manoeuvre incorporated into the design of their football. In England, however, clubs will not call for a reduction lest they turn out to have voted for their own relegation. There are too many sides and the Premiership itinerary is too long, but there is still fun to be had in seeing the contenders set off. The reigning champions Manchester United start at home against Bolton, and Arsenal face Everton at Highbury. Newcastle will examine the condition of careworn Leeds United at Elland Road. Portsmouth and Wolves, making their Premiership debuts, take on Aston Villa and Blackburn respectively. Having been beaten to a Champions League place by Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in the closing game of last season, Liverpool now take on Claudio Ranieri's side at Anfield. A peculiarly early Merseyside derby awaits at the end of August. Eriksson will attend many of these games, brooding on the toll they take on his players. If there is any comfort at all, it lies in the cosmopolitan nature of the Premiership. Other countries, too, may be aghast at England's rituals. How much will Ruud van Nistelrooy have to offer Holland next summer once he has drained himself in United's cause? If England meet France in Portugal, they might also be consoled by the leg-weary state of Arsenal's Thierry Henry and Patrick Vieira. Premiership exhaustion is no respecter of nationalities."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
