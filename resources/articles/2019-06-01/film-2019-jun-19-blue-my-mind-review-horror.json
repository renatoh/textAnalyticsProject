The film looks at first like a young girl\u2019s Euro-arthouse teen awakening, full of damaged sexuality, but it gradually becomes a body-horror romance in the manner of David Cronenberg, with a worrying hint of Ed Wood Jr. The corporeal surreality could be read as a metaphor for menstruation or depression or abuse, but it is presented as true and comes across as perfunctory and a bit flippant. Mia (Luna Wedler) is a shy 15-year-old who has just arrived in town and has to negotiate the horrors of a new high school. In time-honoured movie style, she tries hanging out with the mean-girl clique and finally becomes accepted by them, particularly the queen bitch, Gianna (Zo\u00eb Pastelle Holthuizen). In a sad attempt to be supercool and impress them, Mia hooks up with a middle-aged man in a seedy hotel room. But something is very wrong: she has strange marks on her legs, the skin on her toes seems to be joining up and she has weird yearning memories of the ocean. On a realist level, there are flaws: having been terrified and upset by Mia\u2019s behaviour, would her parents really leave her alone in the house for the weekend while they go away for a wedding? Something awful would surely happen and duly does. When the big reveal happens, I wondered if perhaps a little more of the budget should have been spent on the special creature effects. It is flawed, but has a good performance by Wedler."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
