England were leading six minutes into injury time when Nacho D\u00edaz headed past Josef Bursik to make it 2-2 at the end of their 80-minute match. The game went straight into a penalty shootout, with England\u2019s heads clearly scrambled, having been seconds away from winning the tournament in Croatia. In the shootout, with Uefa trialling a system similar to the tie-break in tennis, with one team taking a penalty, and thereafter everyone taking two in a row, Aidan Barlow tucked the first penalty away but he was the only England player to convert as Rhian Brewster and Joel Latibeaudiere missed. Spain\u2019s Victor Chust scored the final penalty to make it 4-1. England had taken the lead after 18 minutes through Callum Hudson-Odoi although Mateu Morey equalised before half-time in a game with five yellow cards. Phil Foden put England back in front after 58 minutes with Steve Cooper\u2019s men then trying to hold on for a third Under-17 tournament win in eight years, before D\u00edaz struck deep into stoppage time. \u201cWe should be proud,\u201d said Cooper. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a fantastic tournament and a fantastic season, which I\u2019ve said to the players. My emotion is pride and although it doesn\u2019t feel it now this experience will be a good one when we get over it and we can do a little bit better in future tournaments.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
