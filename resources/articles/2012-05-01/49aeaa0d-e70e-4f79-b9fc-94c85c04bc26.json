Welbeck left the Etihad Stadium after United's 1-0 defeat by Manchester City on Monday evening with a protective boot on his left ankle following Nigel de Jong's second-half tackle. Although it is understood the striker will recover for Euro 2012, his participation in United's penultimate match with Swansea City at Old Trafford on Sunday and their final game \u2013 at Sunderland the following weekend \u2013 is in doubt. If he is unavailable for one or both games it represents a blow to Sir Alex Ferguson, who praised the 21-year-old's performance and goal in Sunday's 4-4 draw with Everton at Old Trafford, stating that his developing partnership with Wayne Rooney could be the club's first choice for many years. Ferguson will also find out next week if Paul Pogba has decided to stay at United or join Juventus, according to Mino Raiola, the midfielder's agent. Raiola said: \"I'm in Brazil. I'm back next week and I will handle it next week. I don't know [which way it will go between United and Juventus]. It could be United. I will know next week. I think the boy has a very difficult decision to make.\" Ferguson has continued to talk positively about Pogba in an attempt to retain him at the club and Raiola added: \"I think Paul's very positive about Ferguson too. It's a very difficult decision. He will make it next week.\" The wage demands of Pogba, 19, have led to the impasse, with the midfielder wanting a deal in the region of \u00a315,000 to \u00a320,000 per week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
