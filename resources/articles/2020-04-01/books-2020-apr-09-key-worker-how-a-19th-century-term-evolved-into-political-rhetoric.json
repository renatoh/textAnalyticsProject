One answer to that is to classify certain citizens as \u201ckey workers\u201d: people who work in health, food, transport, utilities, and so forth. Though this phrase has the doomy smell of modern bureaucratic jargon (as in key stakeholders, key performance indicators, and the like), it is actually more than a century old. Some years ago a Whitehall style guide tried to ban the adjectival use of \u201ckey\u201d to mean \u201cimportant\u201d \u2013 rather quixotically, since this sense has been around since the mid-19th century. Within a few decades, the first \u201ckey workers\u201d appeared: they were telegraph operators (who literally pressed keys in Morse code), or, more punningly, burglars who picked locks. In the mid-20th century \u201ckey worker\u201d acquired its present, chiefly British, sense of people considered essential to maintaining the productive peace of entire communities. In modern times, though, \u201ckey worker\u201d has often been used as a rhetorical pat on the head to those whom society nonetheless deems unworthy of pay commensurate with their social importance. That, like so much else, might be on the verge of changing. \u2022 Steven Poole\u2019s A Word for Every Day of the Year is published by Quercus."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
