Middlesbrough have inquired about Phillips but they have yet to make an offer. Sunderland want a minimum of \u00a34m and Boro may yet face rivalry from Tottenham and Blackburn Rovers. Of the three Phillips would prefer a move to Sunderland's north-east neighbours as his family have settled in the region. \"In an ideal world I'd love to stay up here,\" he said. \"I need to get my career sorted out and I hope it is sorted out quickly. Mick McCarthy has said he would like to do business quickly so he knows what plans he can make for the summer, and I would like it to be sorted so I can go away on holiday and relax. \"I am leaving the club. It is disappointing but I did ask at the beginning of the season and that was turned down. I asked again in January and it was turned down then. \"I suppose it has happened in the wrong circumstances but I have had six fantastic years here. The last two have not been great but I like to think I have given everything to the club and they have been great to me as well. I feel it is the time to move on. I feel I have become stale.\" Phillips said he retains his England ambitions and wants to play in Europe. Middlesbrough may not offer the most obvious route to either and Steve McClaren may well have to offload Massimo Maccarone 12 months after spending \u00a38m on the Italian. Maccarone has been a disappointment on Teesside and McClaren recently bought Michael Ricketts from Bolton and Malcolm Christie from Derby County. Newcastle appear to be edging closer to securing their long-standing target Brett Emerton. The Feyenoord player has three games left of the Dutch season but said yesterday that he had heard Newcastle were hovering. \"Newcastle are a big club and everyone knows I have wanted to play in the Premiership,\" Emerton said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
