In the distance, 30 miles (50km) across the turguoise water, White Island\u2019s rumbles are slowly quietening, its flanks just visible through the murky haze of early summer. Waimarla Richards, 42, doesn\u2019t know where else to go, or what else to do, so she sits on a park bench and stares at the sea. Her relative, Tipene Maangi, 23, is presumed dead on the island. More than 24 hours after the volcano erupted, Maangi\u2019s whanau [family] have now given up hope of their boy returning home safely. \u201cWe thought it was just having a blow-out, we didn\u2019t know it would cause harm and take lives \u2013 it\u2019s just horrible,\u201d says Richards. \u201cI don\u2019t have any hope. Now we know how the people at the Pike River mine [where 29 people died in 2010] felt \u2013 you can\u2019t do anything, you just feel helpless.\u201d Maangi started working for White Island tours in September, and his is one of eight bodies thought to on the island. Richards say that Maangi \u201cloved the ocean, loved nature, loved people\u201d and being a guide suited him perfectly \u2013 until the volcano he was showing off to tourists exploded under his feet. \u2018When you go out to the island, you know there\u2019s risk,\u201d says Sharon Honatana, another of Maangi\u2019s extended whanau. \u201cThey have safety procedures, and masks, but it\u2019s unpredictable. It\u2019s mother nature. No one controls her. \u201cKnowing there\u2019s eight still over there, I don\u2019t know what to do but watch over them. And wait.\u201d Police, working with the military, have tried in vain all day to retrieve the bodies, but conditions remain too treacherous, and even drones have been unable to conduct reconnaissance missions amid strong winds and thick, toxic gases. Patience is quickly wearing out among grieving families, and anger is beginning to simmer about why police will not land. Whakat\u0101ne on Tuesday was sombre. Police cars and emergency vehicles cruised up and down the main street of the small coastal town, and the Red Cross set up an emergency support office in the public library, assisting family members with missing loved ones. At Mataatua \u2013 the tribal meeting house for the local iwi, Ng\u0101ti Awa, who run the White Island tours \u2013 a large TV was erected, and an endless loop of Jacinda Ardern\u2019s emergency press conference when the prime minister visited the town on Monday evening. Sandwiches and fruit were laid out for grieving families, who gathered first with some hope, and then eventually with resignation, as police remained firm in their assessment that no one remained alive on the island. At the Whakat\u0101ne wharf, three large White Island tour boats were berthed, one with a dingy still covered in ash. Operators cancelled tours offering dives or trips to nearby islands, and commercial fisherman spent the day scrubbing their boats after police banned any vessels from travelling within five nautical miles of White Island. Roy McIntyre, 60, has been a fisherman in Whakat\u0101ne for decades and says the volcano \u201chas been meek and mild for about 30 years\u201d, but prior to that it was \u201ca blowing-up, burnt mess for about 20 years\u201d. \u201cIt is a tragic, natural event but I am sure there will be people to blame, and there should be people to blame,\u201d said McIntyre. \u201cOlder people in town envisaged this when they started doing the tours 30 years ago. Because White Island is White Island \u2013 you don\u2019t know when it\u2019s going to blow up. I thought it was a matter of time and they were probably lucky to get away with it for this long really.\u201d The mayor of Whak\u0101tane, Judy Turner, said she would continue to support tourism on White Island, despite Monday\u2019s tragic events. But with the death toll likely to climb, due to some of the injured being severely burned, hers is a sentiment that is finding little traction. \u201cAt the time they went out [the eruption alert] was a level two, and in the matrix of things that is not considered a high reading ... they have been out numerous times at that level,\u201d Turner said, appearing to defend the tour company\u2019s decision to take 47 people to the island, despite weeks of increased activity. \u201cYou\u2019ll be aware that tourism is significant for our local area. We are aware there are questions and you can be assured ... that at the appropriate time we will answer the questions that need to be asked.\u201d However, many local residents told the Guardian they have felt unease about the tours for years. Some local M\u0101ori say the island, viewed as an ancestor by many, erupted as a sign of protest at too many visitors, too many boats. \u201cIt must be one of our largest tourism disasters, it\u2019s major for our small town and the country\u2019s tourism industry as a whole,\u201d says Phil van Dusschoten from Diveworks Charters Fishing and Diving, who has worked off White Island for 24 years. \u201cLike anything, I guess, to do with nature, if you\u2019re going to put more people out there, more frequently, in greater numbers, over a longer period of time \u2013 it is always going to increase the chances of something happening. We\u2019re still learning about volcanoes all the time; to have only a second\u2019s notice, I suppose we just can\u2019t account for it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
