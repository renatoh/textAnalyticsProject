Now new subcultural types distinctive enough to be intelligible to adults have emerged, in large part via trend superconductor TikTok. You can read about VSCO girls (beachy and eco-conscious and inconspicuously rich) and e-girls (emo types who are very online) in publications such as the New York Times and the Columbia Journalism Review. Yet the holy trinity of Gen Z teen girl taxonomy would not be complete without the soft girl, the internet\u2019s new favorite girl-next-door. Though she may be lesser-known than the VSCO or e-girl, the soft girl is nonetheless a codified persona mainstream enough to have her own BuzzFeed quizzes, viral hashtag challenges, and six separate Urban Dictionary definitions in 2019. (The \u201csoftboi\u201d also exists \u2013 he\u2019s an emotionally exploitative lothario described here). \u201cI feel like the soft-girl aesthetic is really popping off if you look in the right places,\u201d says Jamie, a 14-year-old West Virginian and creator of Reddit\u2019s r/softgirl, over Messenger. \u201cOn TikTok, I see a lot of videos radiating soft-girl energy.\u201d That means, she says, \u201chair clips, soft colors, mom jeans, glossy lips and overall just a dreamy vibe\u201d. You will find the soft girl online, pigtailed, clad in pastels, perhaps with a spray of faux freckles \u2013 or little clouds, or hearts \u2013 painted across her blush-pinkened cheeks and highlighted nose. She may wear toned-down versions of this look to school and in daily life, but its fully realized, campy extreme can only be found when she broadcasts on social media, usually from her bedroom. The soft look isn\u2019t new \u2013 teens have pursued cuteness forever, and the underpinnings of soft-girl style have long incubated on Instagram, and on Tumblr, where glittery girlishness has been associated with a controversial fourth-wave \u201cTumblr feminist\u201d effort to satirize gender expectations by amplifying feminine stereotypes. Several of the genre\u2019s components also have roots in anime fan culture; for instance, peppering one\u2019s textual speech with the manga-derived emoticon \u201cuwu\u201d, (pronounced \u201cou-wu,\u201d like babytalk) meant to resemble a smiling face with closed eyes, and used to indicate the speaker either is being cute themselves or is responding to something cute (similar to \u201caww\u201d). Although glitter, pastel hair and \u201cuwu\u201d have been around for a while, it\u2019s only in the last year these components have truly coalesced into the latter-day manic pixie dream girl, catching sufficient fire to garner an official \u201csoft szn\u201d (spring), \u201cget-the-look\u201d shopping guides, and rap shout-outs. For the latter, listen to SoundCloud rapper Haroinfather\u2019s TikTok-famous track Tunnel of Love, an ode to soft girls featuring the verse \u201cYou so fucking cute / When I see you I uwu\u201d (in case you were wondering, yes, his use of \u201cuwu\u201d as a verb is novel). All together, the vision of femininity soft girls evoke can be seen as dispiritingly retrograde \u2013 a kittenish broadcast of reductive tropes from a generation older feminists probably hoped would grow up more enlightened. Don\u2019t these girls have anything better to do than spend their time and money trying to look harmless on the internet? The impulse to dismiss the soft girl as silly may overlook the deeply felt vulnerability of girlhood, and the desire to reckon with it on one\u2019s own terms. In 2015, the author Lucy Ellman described teenage girls as living \u201cin terror of the society in which they find themselves \u2026 their main aim is to reach adulthood without being raped, shot, manhandled, or murdered.\u201d It\u2019s a dark statement, but not an inaccurate one. Teen girls are often discredited and exploited for being pretty and eager to please others, characteristics dominant culture pressures them to have. Girls are disproportionately penalized by school attire policies, body-shamed, and blamed for \u201cinviting\u201d sexual harassment, which most begin experiencing at about 14. According to Simon May, professor of philosophy at King\u2019s College London and author of 2019\u2019s The Power of Cute, there is more going on with soft girls than just blush and Bambi eyes. Cuteness, he says, especially when it\u2019s over the top, \u201csteps outside the power paradigm\u201d. \u201cTo me, these girls are ironizing the whole question of power. Do they have it, don\u2019t they have it, what is it to have it, and does it matter?\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I look at [soft girls] I have no idea how much power they have or want, whether they are playing or protesting, or playing at protesting. Something about their playfulness seems to question why we see human life so exclusively, almost one-dimensionally, through a lens of power.\u201d So, is the soft girl aesthetic a sarcastic send-up of power dynamics? Is it a kind of sublimation of teen girl frustration at society\u2019s hypocrisy towards them? Could it be a self-soothing attempt to cultivate tenderness in a frightening world? It may be a all these things and more. Irony, as May points out, is clearly a factor of the soft-girl look. The popular 2019 #softgirlchallenge, in which teens edited their videos so they appeared to spontaneously transform from grungy e-girl to glimmering soft girl particularly conveys how lightly Gen Z wears its group affiliations. These subcultures exist simultaneously as personas, styles, statements and jokes. Once, high-schoolers may have rigidly aligned with their in-groups, committing to being a punk or a hippie, a theatre kid or a cheerleader; today, the performative medium of TikTok encourages mutability \u2013 you can play with being an e-girl or a soft girl or any other archetype you please. As for Jamie, she says she likes the soft-girl look because it\u2019s fun to express herself through softness. \u201cEmbracing cuteness, getting into cute things, it really boosted my happiness and made me more comfortable with my life,\u201d she says. She thinks she\u2019ll stick with the soft-girl aesthetic for a while due to its \u201cpositive energy\u201d, but she may change it up one day. Why? Because, she says, \u201cthat\u2019s what you do when you\u2019re finding yourself.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
