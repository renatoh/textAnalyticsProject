So far, against Bayern Munich and Roma, Pellegrini\u2019s squad have lacked inspiration, with Tour\u00e9 a particular disappointment. After losing 1-0 in Bavaria and drawing 1-1 with Roma at the Etihad Stadium, City have a point and are virtually playing sudden death in Group E. In those two outings Tour\u00e9, David Silva, Sergio Ag\u00fcero, and Edin Dzeko were among those who disappointed. Asked how important it was the Ivorian and his other big guns fire, the manager said: \u201cI always say when you want to win something you need a team that knows how to play and after that you need to have your best performance. \u201cWe have very important players and of course they must make the difference after the team plays in a way I like. Maybe against Bayern Munich we were a little bit unlucky, it was a game we play away. Against Roma we didn\u2019t play well, but I hope we start now in Champions League playing the way we have in the last two games in Premier League.\u201d This was reference to the 2-0 win at Aston Villa and Saturday\u2019s 4-1 victory over Tottenham Hotspur, which featured an Ag\u00fcero quadruple. Yet here was a topsy-turvy affair that featured four penalties \u2013 one missed by the Argentinian \u2013 plus a Federico Fazio red card and ended up as a thumping from the champions while featuring sloppiness from them, as noted by Pellegrini. The chief culprit was Fernando, who gave away possession in threatening positions, a cardinal sin for all holding midfielders. His manager said: \u201cWe must be balanced. Football is always different, if you are talking about the game we played [against Spurs], of course, it\u2019s not normal to concede or lose so many balls near our box. But if you talk to me about the [other] games we play, we didn\u2019t lose balls but we didn\u2019t have clear chances to score. \u201cWe had excess of [clumsiness] with the ball at our foot because we lost three or four important balls near our box, that can finish with a goal. And in that way I am sure we will have the concentration we need first to not concede a goal [against CSKA]. And, after, to work the 90 minutes, and working as an offensive team as we always do, we are going to score goals.\u201d The City executive have targeted the quarter-finals to show progression from last term\u2019s achievement of reaching the last 16. Yet despite this the Chilean refuses to bill the clash at the Arena Khimki, which will be empty due to CSKA\u2019s stadium ban for racist behaviour from fans, as the campaign\u2019s most important match. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t agree about that because when we started the game against Bayern Munich it was a very important game and against Roma also,\u201d Pellegrini said. \u201cWe are talking just about Champions League. What we know is that we must win if we want to continue to have options to qualify for the next stage. But we are not just playing Champions League. If we don\u2019t win against Tottenham and Chelsea wins, eight points behind Chelsea is very difficult. \u201cWe are involved in four competitions, at the moment in three. After that we\u2019re going to start the FA Cup. I hope we are going to play in the same way as we did, especially against Aston Villa, not conceding one chance \u2013 well I think one chance in 90 minutes.\u201d Ag\u00fcero\u2019s four against Spurs featured two penalties plus two of the sharp finishes that have marked his time with City, and throughout his career. The striker is now the club\u2019s highest Premier League scorer on 61 goals, passing Carlos Tevez\u2019s record of 58. If Ag\u00fcero continues in similar vein against Leonid Slutsky\u2019s team in Moscow they could be blown away. Joe Hart, whose fine save at 2-1 from a Roberto Soldado penalty was pivotal, offered an intriguing revelation regarding Ag\u00fcero: \u201cI don\u2019t think he will be unhappy with me saying it \u2013 that some days in training he is useless. That is just down to him. He\u2019s a big-match player. Finishing-wise he is the best.\u201d While Frank Lampard will not travel due to the muscle injury suffered against Spurs, City badly need Ag\u00fcero and his team-mates to prove, again, how good they are in Moscow.
