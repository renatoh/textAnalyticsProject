The governor, Jay Nixon, said the national guard had been involved in extensive police planning for any eventuality after the announcement of a decision by jurors considering the potential prosecution of officer Darren Wilson, who killed Brown on 9 August. National Guard forces \u201cwill continue to be available when we determine it is necessary to support local law enforcement\u201d, Nixon told a press conference. \u201cI\u2019m prepared to make that order,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the time operationally that it is necessary to move forward, we will.\u201d Authorities around Ferguson, a northern suburb of St Louis, are braced for further unrest amid widespread expectations that Wilson, 28, will not be indicted for the shooting, which took place in sharply contested circumstances after he stopped Brown and a friend for jaywalking. Intense protests in the days after Brown\u2019s death met a militarised police response that drew sharp criticism from regional leaders and civil rights organisations. Nixon on Tuesday declined to comment on whether police were again prepared to use teargas and rubber bullets. Criticising a minority of activists for blighting earlier demonstrations with \u201csenseless acts of violence and destruction\u201d, Nixon on Tuesday said \u201cthat ugliness was not representative of Missouri, and that cannot be repeated\u201d and warned \u201cviolence will not be tolerated\u201d during any future protests. \u201cThe world is watching,\u201d he said. \u201cPeace must prevail\u201d. \u201cThis is America,\u201d said Nixon, a Democrat once discussed as a potential vice-presidential candidate in 2016. \u201cPeople have the right to express their views and grievances, but they do not have the right to place their fellow citizens and property at risk.\u201d Nixon\u2019s remarks came days after James Knowles, Ferguson\u2019s mayor, said that they would \u201cprepare for the worst\u201d following the grand jury\u2019s announcement.\u201d He told a local television station last week: \u201cThere are expectations that demonstrations probably will break out in several places.\u201d Grand jurors have been hearing evidence gathered by county police on the shooting in secret for almost three months. Bob McCulloch, the prosecuting attorney for St Louis County, has said only that he expects their decision to be announced in \u201cmid-to-late November\u201d. The US Department of Justice and FBI have been carrying out a separate inquiry into Brown\u2019s death for potential federal civil rights charges against Wilson. However officials have indicated in leaks to the media that such charges are also unlikely. Nixon stressed that officials had been drawing up policing plans \u201caround the clock\u201d not because authorities were \u201cconvinced that that violence will occur\u201d and \u201cregardless of the outcome of the parallel local and federal investigations\u201d. He said that unrest would be policed by a \u201cunified command\u201d of officers from St Louis County, which led the much-criticised response to early protests, along with the Missouri state highway patrol and the city of St Louis\u2019s metropolitan police. Wilson\u2019s colleagues in Ferguson\u2019s police force will apparently not be involved in policing future protests. Reports earlier this month indicated that federal and regional authorities may be readying an overhaul of Ferguson police that would include the resignation of chief Thomas Jackson, who gave a calamitous response to Brown\u2019s shooting, and possibly the dissolution of the force. Nixon said on Tuesday that the issue of the force\u2019s future was a \u201clocal one that will be dealt with by local officials\u201d. The governor said that 1,000 police officers had undergone a total of 5,000 hours of training in crowd control over recent weeks as they prepared for potential unrest. He said that he had received hundreds of applications for seats on his \u201cFerguson commission\u201d to address the deeper-seated problems brought into focus by the reaction to Brown\u2019s death. Captain Ron Johnson of the Missouri state highway patrol, who won plaudits for his liberalised approach to policing August\u2019s protests following the earlier crackdown, said on at Tuesday\u2019s announcement that officers would ensure that the region\u2019s children were safe to attend school, that their parents were able to go to work and that senior citizens felt secure. \u201cThe history of our nation and our community will not be determined by destruction, but it will be exemplified by the great character of the people of our region,\u201d said Johnson."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
