When asked at an event organised by Politico in London on Wednesday whether the wartime British prime minister was a hero or a villain, McDonnell replied: \u201cTonypandy. Villain\u201d. He was referring to the incident in the south Wales town in November 1910 when one miner was killed and about 580 people, including 80 policemen, were injured after Churchill, the then home secretary, sent 200 Metropolitan police officers with a detachment of Lancashire Fusiliers held in reserve in Cardiff to stop riots that erupted after police attempted to break the miners\u2019 picket line. The soldiers were eventually deployed, although it has been long disputed whether Churchill personally sanctioned the decision. Churchill nonetheless remained deeply unpopular in the south Wales valleys and within the Labour party. In response to McDonnell\u2019s answer, Churchill\u2019s grandson Sir Nicholas Soames claimed the shadow chancellor was seeking publicity and branded him a \u201cPoundland Lenin\u201d. \u201cFrankly it\u2019s a very foolish and stupid thing to say, surely said to gain publicity,\u201d he told the Daily Telegraph. \u201cI think my grandfather\u2019s reputation can withstand a publicity-seeking assault from a third-rate, Poundland Lenin. I don\u2019t think it will shake the world.\u201d There has been renewed debate recently over the legacy of Churchill, who in 2002 was named the greatest Briton ever in a BBC poll. The Good Morning Britain host Piers Morgan rebuked the Green party MSP Ross Greer on live TV last month after the politician called Churchill a \u201cwhite supremacist mass murderer\u201d in a tweet. During the live Politico London Playbook interview, McDonnell also conceded that it was unlikely that Labour would be able to force a general election to renegotiate Brexit, after the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, suggested it was not a credible option. \u201cWe\u2019re still in the hope of a general election, but it\u2019s unlikely, so, yeah, I think [Starmer was right],\u201d McDonnell said. The MP for Hayes and Harlington also said Theresa May was \u201cfloundering\u201d and predicted parliament would soon take Brexit \u201coff her hands\u201d to force a softer exit upon the government. Suggesting that Labour\u2019s demand for a permanent customs union could be the price for supporting the EU withdrawal agreement, McDonnell said: \u201cWe think it could fly with parliament eventually.\u201d He later warned: \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate the strength of feeling to prevent no deal.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 15 February 2019. An earlier version reported that McDonnell\u2019s response to the Churchill question was: \u201cVillain \u2013 Tonypandy.\u201d This has been corrected to \u201cTonypandy. Villain\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
