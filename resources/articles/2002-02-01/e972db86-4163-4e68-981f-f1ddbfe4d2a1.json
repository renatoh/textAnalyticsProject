I am reporting from the thick of Cambodia's first local elections for thirty years. The Cambodian People's Party (CPP) has been in power since Pol Pot was toppled in the late 1970s, and they are now in a bit of a flap if the rather desperate parades and rallies are anything to go by. With me on one side of the road, and Pren my hired driver on the other, I had to wait a good twenty minutes for the CPP parade to pass by outside my guesthouse near Angkor before I could cross. There were schoolkids with flowers, robed nuns and monks, military on horseback, pick-up trucks loaded with workers blasting Khmer pop tunes from their bullhorns and a fleet of motor scooters. The whole lot was decked out with CPP bunting and seemed very unspontaneous to me. The main opposition parties are Sam Raimsy (who I thought directed The Evil Dead) and Funcinpecs (which sounds like we're back with the Bangkok go-go boys). Song, who I met over a chicken noodle curry breakfast at a street stall, was a Raimsy supporter, but still would lean over and cover his mouth every time he mentioned Raimsy's name. And hearing from Song that eight candidates had been murdered during the campaign soon wiped the smirk of my face. Public transportation in Cambodia? What's the Khmer for \"You're havin' a laugh\"? The only public transport a guy can rely on is his taxi-boy. You cannot step out into the street here without youths on motorbikes all over you like a rash, offering a driver for the day, not to mention massage and bum-bum with a taxi-girl. Supply of taxi-boys outweighs demand by a long way, and I picked Mr Ya who had the best English, the coolest business card and the nicest shirt-and-trouser combo. That he was heart-breakingly handsome was a coincidence. I asked Mr Ya to drive me out to Tuol Sleng, the suburban high school that the Khmer Rouge turned into a prison and holding pen for transportation of prisoners to the so-called Killing Fields. Potted history and photographs apart, Tuol Sleng has been left pretty much as it was discovered by the Vietnamese in 1980. It is truly the creepiest, most horrible place I have ever been to. I could even say evil. Individual brick cells were crudely built in the classrooms, and some chains are still attached to the floor. The Killing Fields themselves, or Choeung Ek as they are called here, are haunting and sad, but dignified. A central 'stupa' houses more than 8000 skulls arranged in rows on glass shelves. Piles of rags, which were once someone's clothing, are heaped up below each shelf. Perhaps because the victims were dead by the time they got there, the site doesn't seem haunted, just a moving tribute. But the air at Tuol Sleng is thick with death. After that, I told Mr Ya, I needed to do something fun. He suggested a visit to a shooting range to fire an AK47. Though the timing could have been better, I absolutely loved it. I donned fatigues and pumped off twenty bullets one by one, then another ten on automatic. About half hit the target. Not so bad. I felt like Sabrina in Charlie's Angels. They had the maddest menu I have ever seen - alongside Orange Fanta were Hand Grenade and Luger. I didn't indulge. After that, I told Mr Ya, I want to do something else that's fun, but maybe not quite so violent. He hit the jackpot with a uniquely Cambodian \"hammock bar\", way outside of town. From the road, a walkway is built out over the wetlands, with individual screened platforms on each side. Each one has mats and hammocks, and Khmers come here to chill. There were groups of men playing cards and slapping them on the mats in the way they do. There were canoodling couples, old biddies having a natter, and me and Mr Ya. A real treat. Tourism in Cambodia is mostly centred around Angkor, site of the greatest collection of temples in South East Asia. I spent two days there this week, and seeing the remains of this great civilization at a time when Cambodia no longer has a skilled workforce or intelligentsia is very sobering, and I just couldn't shake off the chill of those hideous brick cells at Tuol Sleng. My Angkor taxi-boy Mr Pren was great, giving me a bit of background on all the temples, and even finding someone who could repair the tread that was flapping off one of my trainers. He couldn't explain why all the Japanese women were wearing white gloves though. The sun? The dirt? The stones? Anyone know? At this point in my itinerary, it dawned on me that I had travelled myself into a corner. To complete the circle I had to get to Malaysia, which was the next stop after Thailand, Laos and Cambodia. But once in Cambodia, I realised that this eager-to-please, charming but messed up country is in no fit state to be running ferries to Malaysia. My only option was to head back to Bangkok then overland south to Thailand. Two major journeys, best part of a day each. All this is fine, character building, whatever - except that during the night some serious problems kicked in down below. Now I wouldn't normally block myself up with diarrhoea medication, but with such a long journey ahead of me - on a minibus - I decided I had no choice. That morning my breakfast was like something out of the film Valley of the Dolls: two sachets of rehydration salts, two immodium capsules, one Larium, and a banana."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
