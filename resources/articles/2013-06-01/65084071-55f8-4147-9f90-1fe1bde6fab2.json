His photos of US troops wading ashore at Omaha beach have passed into popular memory of that morning. In the second world war version of embedding, Capa was with the 16th Regiment of the 1st Infantry Division as they hit French soil. \"My beautiful France looked sordid and uninviting, and a German machine gun, spitting bullets around the barge, fully spoiled my return,\" he recalled. And through all this, he squeezed off shot after shot of the soldiers in the surf. When the film got back to Life magazine, the staff were in such a rush they ruined all but 11 frames. The Hungarian Capa had been a brilliant photographer of the European slump, but it was war that made him a legend \u2013 and which killed him. On assignment in Indochina in 1954, aged 40, he trod on a mine and did not live to make it to the field hospital. \u2022 This article was amended on 6 June 2013. The original version said the D-day invasion passed another anniversary on Wednesday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
