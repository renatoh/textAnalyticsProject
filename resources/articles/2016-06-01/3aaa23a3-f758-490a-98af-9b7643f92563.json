Women who are overweight or obese have a higher risk of breast cancer. But accumulating evidence suggests that becoming fitter and losing some pounds after a diagnosis could cut the chances of a recurrence and even lower the risk of death. A number of small studies looking at the benefits of exercise and weight loss on cancer by researchers at Yale University in the US are being presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting (ASCO) in Chicago. Prof Melinda Irwin, associate director at Yale Cancer Center and professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health, said: \u201cWe found a strong connection between exercise after diagnosis and mortality afterwards. \u201cMost interestingly, it showed the impact on changes in activity on mortality \u2013 even if you\u2019ve never been active before taking regular exercise seemed to show a great impact.\u201d The studies followed women who went on a diet and started taking exercise after cancer but they did not randomly assign women to a fitness regime or not, so it is possible those who did well were also better at taking their drug treatment. \u201cBut I am in the camp that says this association is causal and reversible \u2013 and that\u2019s what these latest studies indicate,\u201d said Irwin. \u201cThey show that losing weight and taking up exercise have a significant effect on the biomarkers of cancer. They are showing that it\u2019s causal \u2013 that by changing activity or weight loss it could improve your prognosis. This is crucial.\u201d Among these small studies is one involving 144 women with ovarian cancer who did 150 minutes of aerobic exercise each week for six months. Early results show they had a drop in the levels of certain hormones linked with the growth of tumours, compared with women who did not exercise. Another study of 221 women with breast cancer found those who lost weight on a diet had a drop in the levels of a protein that fuels tumour growth. The trial of 3,200 women in Canada and the US, which will start on 1 August, will seek to answer the questions raised by these small studies. It will be a randomised controlled trial, allocating the participants into two groups to compare their progress. One group will be put on a diet and exercise regime, supervised and supported by a fitness coach who will speak to them regularly on the phone. The other group will be given advice on healthy eating and activity. \u201cWe have known for many years that women who are overweight or obese and diagnosed with breast cancer have a higher risk of their cancer recurring and ultimately dying from breast cancer as compared to leaner women with similarly sized tumours at a similar stage with similar treatment,\u201d said Dr Jennifer Ligibel, of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston,who is leading the breast cancer. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know why that is the case but it\u2019s been seen over and over now in more than a hundred studies. \u201cThere is some preliminary evidence that helping women to lose weight after they\u2019ve been diagnosed with breast cancer could be helpful. That\u2019s never been tested in the setting of a large-scale randomised trial. \u201cSo we are very interested in testing the hypothesis that if you take women who are overweight or obese, complete their standard treatment for breast cancer and you have them take part in a weight loss programme that that would lower their risk of breast cancer recurrence.\u201d The aim is for women to lose 10% of their starting weight, through a diet of 1,200 to 1,500 calories and bout 150 minutes of activity a week over first six months. \u201cThen for women who attain that try to get them more up to 220 to 250 minutes if we can because that\u2019s really the level that\u2019s been shown to help keep weight off after you\u2019ve lost it,\u201d she said. They can choose any activity they like and she expects walking to be popular. \u201cIt\u2019s a very accessible form of exercise. It doesn\u2019t cost anything. You just need a pair of shoes. My patients always ask me what\u2019s the best form of physical activity and honestly the answer is the one that you\u2019ll do,\u201d she said. The results of the trial will not be known for several years, but if it is successful, she hopes to see doctors prescribing exercise and weight loss diets as well as drugs where necessary. \u201cThis would be the first time that a lifestyle programme was really something that was standardly prescribed as part of cancer treatment,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
