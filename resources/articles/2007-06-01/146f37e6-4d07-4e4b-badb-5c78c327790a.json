Fortunately I don't have to change anything. I just have to make sure I'm on the right route. \"Of course I try to do what is best, not only for me but also what is best for all the youngsters. I've noticed there are a lot of young kids very interested. I've read letters from them this week and last week and they are telling me that all of a sudden they want to be racing drivers.\" David Coulthard said yesterday that he was driving as well as Hamilton and doing \"remarkable things\" with his Red Bull-Renault RB3. \"Everyone who enters a formula one race is obviously in it to win,\" said the Scot. \"Opportunities to win come with the car that you drive.\" Robert Kubica has been given the go-ahead to race on Sunday. The Pole missed the United States grand prix after a spectacular crash in Montreal which was measured at 75 times the force of gravity. He sustained nothing more than light concussion, however, thanks to the strength and safety of his BMW Sauber. He was denied the chance to race at Indianapolis because of fears that after his concussion another accident could have had serious consequences, but the 22-year-old will be back in action for today's two practice sessions. \"I am 100% fit and looking forward to the French grand prix,\" said Kubica. \"Although I wasn't allowed to test [at Silverstone last week] I've used the time to focus intensively on the next race. Now I can't wait to get back into the car.\" In Kubica's absence at Indianapolis Germany's Sebastian Vettel, 19, became the youngest driver to score a point in formula one when he finished eighth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
