If confirmed after a re-count demanded by her establishment-backed candidate Melinda Katz, the 31-year-old public defender and queer Latina will have pulled off an upset some say could mark a new direction for criminal-justice reform in America. Among her campaign promises, Cab\u00e1n said she will reverse decades-old polices that have led to record levels of incarceration, including not asking for cash bail. She also would not prosecute sex workers or their customers. Cab\u00e1n is also in favor of closing down Rikers Island, the notorious prison in Queens. Last night, with 98% of the vote reported, Cab\u00e1n held a razor-thin 1,229-vote lead over Katz, the borough president backed by the same Queens Democratic machine that Ocasio-Cortez crushed a year ago. But Katz has so far refused to concede, and claims 3,400 absentee votes still to be counted could still put her over the winning line. \u201cWhen we started this thing, they said I was too young. They said I didn\u2019t look like a district attorney,\u201d said Cab\u00e1n, a Democratic socialist, at her raucous election-night party. \u201cThey said we could not build a movement from the grassroots. They said we could not win. But we did it, y\u2019all.\u201d The Republican candidate for DA, Daniel Kogan, 61, said he might not even contest Cab\u00e1n in November. \u201cI sorta sensed a lot of the enthusiasm for her. I expected it,\u201d Kogan said after Cab\u00e1n claimed her surprise victory. At Cab\u00e1n\u2019s election-night party at a nightclub in Queens, chants like \u201cBlack lives matter!\u201d and \u201cPeople power!\u201d could be heard over the festivities. Two prominent progressive prosecutors, Philadelphia\u2019s Larry Krasner and Boston\u2019s Rachael Rollins, joined the celebrations. In her victory speech, Cab\u00e1n acknowledged the support of Ocasio-Cortez, who tweeted about the apparent victory. \u201cWe meet a machine with a movement,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. Cab\u00e1n also received endorsements from Senator Elizabeth Warren and the New York Times. Senator Bernie Sanders congratulated Cab\u00e1n in a tweet. \u201cTiffany Cab\u00e1n took on virtually the entire political establishment and built a grassroots movement,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis is a victory for working people everywhere who are fighting for real political change and demanding we end cash bail, mass incarceration and the failed war on drugs.\u201d Outside the club, some of Cab\u00e1n\u2019s supporters from the transgender sex worker community came to celebrate her victory. TS Candii, a 26-year-old transgender sex worker, said it will be \u201camazing to have a DA who wont prosecute us just for wearing a little skirt and a pair of heels\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
