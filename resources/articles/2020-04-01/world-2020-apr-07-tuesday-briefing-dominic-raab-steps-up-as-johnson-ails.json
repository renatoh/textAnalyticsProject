I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories this morning. Dominic Raab has taken charge of running the country following the decision to move Boris Johnson to intensive care in St Thomas\u2019 hospital in London after his coronavirus symptoms worsened significantly yesterday. A spokesperson for No 10 said the move was a \u201cprecaution\u201d in case the prime minister needed to be placed on a ventilator. He is understood to have received oxygen through a mask since going to hospital on Sunday. Raab, the foreign secretary, attempted to reassure the public by telling the BBC last night that government business would continue. His elevation came after senior cabinet ministers became concerned that Johnson\u2019s health meant he could no longer be in charge of the government\u2019s response to the emergency. Our columnist Simon Jenkins warns that Johnson\u2019s hospitalisation shows the machinery of government is malfunctioning. Donald Trump led world leaders in sending his best wishes for Johnson\u2019s recovery, adding that he was praying for his \u201cgood friend\u201d and \u201cincredible guy\u201d. Others included Emmanuel Macron, Justin Trudeau and Angela Merkel. Johnson also received messages of support from the new Labour leader Keir Starmer and his own predecessors Theresa May and David Cameron. Johnson\u2019s admission to intensive care shows that he has a severe case of the disease, our health editor writes. Around 5% of people with Covid-19 require treatment in ICU where a ventilator can help them breathe while their damaged lungs recover. And it comes as the Doctors\u2019 Association UK warns that its members are being \u201cbullied and shamed\u201d into not wearing protective equipment during the crisis because of shortages. Some have been told to \u201chold their breath\u201d while treating patients. This week marks 100 days since the first report of an unknown illness affecting a number of people in Wuhan but today China recorded no deaths for the first time since January. The global death toll from Covid-19 has risen to almost 75,000 and there are now close to 1,375,000 cases. Here is our latest at-a-glance summary and we will have all the developments throughout the day on our coronavirus live blog.

Sitting in Brisbane, the judges granted leave for Pell to appeal and ordered his immediate release. They said the jury in his trial should have entertained a doubt as to Pell\u2019s guilt. The cardinal, a former financial controller of the Vatican, said he held \u201cno ill will\u201d towards his accuser, a former choirboy in Melbourne. * * * Quiz question \u2013 The writer of a new television drama about the Who Wants To Be A Millionaire cheating scandal says the couple at the centre of the story might not have been guilty. James Graham, whose show Quiz airs next week on ITV, says the case against army major Charles Ingram, his wife Diana and their coughing accomplice Tecwen Whittock \u2013 who were convicted of defrauding the show \u2013 might not be \u201cblack and white\u201d. He says their accent and class meant they were more easily turned into \u201ctabloid fodder\u201d and claims new evidence points to their innocence. * * * Reef at risk \u2013 Australia\u2019s most senior Great Barrier Reef scientist has issued a grim warning about the marine wonder, saying that it has suffered a third mass bleaching event in five years in a clear signal that \u201curgent help\u201d is needed on climate change. Dr David Wachenfeld, chief scientist at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, told Guardian Australia: \u201cMy greatest fear is that people will lose hope for the reef. Without hope there\u2019s no action.\u201d * * * Brand Archewell \u2013 The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are planning to launch a new charitable organisation to replace the Sussex Royal brand. The couple said the new foundation will be called Archewell, revealing that the Greek word in the project, Arche \u2013 which means source of action \u2013 was also the inspiration behind the name of their son Archie.
