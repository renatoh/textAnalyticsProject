Not only has it been hard to escape Payne \u2013 whose daughter Sarah was murdered in 2000 by the known paedophile Roy Whiting, and who has since that awful crime campaigned for a \"Sarah's Law\" to give parents information about convicted child sex offenders \u2013 but it also remains difficult to be seen to criticise her position. To do so appears insensitive and cruel, although frankly if we want to take her seriously we must leave sentiment behind and expose her thinking to a much more critical analysis than it has so far received. Should the criminal justice system be reshaped towards victims? I can think of nothing worse. Surely we want to prioritise what is reasonable, proper and proportionate in relation to those cases which come before the courts, as opposed to the inevitable emotion that some victims of crime \u2013 for all the right reasons \u2013 inspire. Leave reason and proportionality behind and we are on the slippery slope towards state-sanctioned vigilantism in our courts, with the law being administered according to media sensation and moral panic. I'm also not convinced that the criminal justice system is in any event the best place for victims' needs to be addressed. I would have presumed that these were much better managed through, for example, the NHS \u2013 if counselling or health needs were paramount \u2013 or though any number of NGOs and charities if there were broader needs or questions related to the courts, the probation or prison service. So too \u2013 I know from my own experiences \u2013 that this very phrase \"victims' needs\" totalises what victims actually want, and so hides a mass of differing views, issues and experiences. Payne says that she wants the justice system to support the victim to overcome the impact of crime so that they can get on with their lives. But what form should that support take? I have met the victims of house burglary, for example, who have been traumatised by what has happened to them and find it impossible to \"move on\" from that event, and I have spoken with those who want to meet the person who committed the burglary to tell them how this has made them feel. On the other hand, I have come across those who simply want their property back, or to be awarded compensation. And, here's the thing, each and every one of these different groups of victims would be able to access support to meet these needs, or be able to achieve what it is that they want within the criminal justice system as it stands. Period. No one \u2013 least of all me \u2013 would dream of criticising the family of a murdered child for the position that they subsequently take in relation to how they were treated in relation to that crime, or what they want to change as a consequence of that shocking event. But are such individuals in the best position to advocate for these changes? Or might they instead \u2013 for perfectly understandable reasons \u2013 be partial and driven to campaign for policies that might not necessarily deliver on their hoped-for objectives? So, despite my admiration for what Sara Payne has done since 2000, I do not want our criminal justice system reshaped towards victims, but rather I want justice to continue to characterise what that system does. For when justice is at the heart of our criminal justice system, we all benefit \u2013 victims, society, and, dare I say it, offenders too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
