The Ireland full-back broke his leg in a pre-World Cup friendly against Scotland at Murrayfield in August and a pin that was inserted to help the injury mend may need to be removed. Murphy, who reports back to training with Leicester on Monday, was out of action until February, but returned to help turn around the Tigers' season and also won back his place in the Ireland side. His Ireland team-mate Guy Easterby has agreed a one-year contract with Leinster, subject to his passing a medical, having spent last season with Rotherham. The Irish Rugby Football Union has denied reports that it has told its provinces not to field their national squad players in Celtic League fixtures in Wales and Scotland. The IRFU chief executive Philip Browne admitted the union wanted to restrict leading players to 30 matches a year, but said nothing had been set in stone."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
