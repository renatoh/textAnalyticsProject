I would hate to think that the game was off. I know people might say it gives us an extra week to prepare because of the internationals this week but we just want to get on with it. It looks like, unless anything major happens over the next couple of days, the game will go ahead. I can understand the Tottenham game being off because of what happened there last weekend. It has been great that some of the players and managers have come out and tried to keep people calm, the people involved in the incidents, and tried to let them see how damaging it is to our country as a whole\ue11d Steve Kean, Blackburn Rovers We've been told the match goes ahead unless there are some major issues over the next couple of nights. \ue11cIf the police think crowd safety is an issue then they are well within their rights to call games off. Things settled down last night in Manchester, which is the only problem that would affect us as our police force would be called away to deal with issues there. Hopefully, it has settled down for good now and we can get on with the football\ue11d Owen Coyle, Bolton Wanderers We've been told the match goes ahead unless there are some major issues over the next couple of nights. \ue11cWe are all aware what is happening in the world but until we hear otherwise we have to prepare as though we have a game. We all love football and want the Premier League under way but safety is paramount and I am sure the police and councils will come to the right decision\ue11d Alan Pardew, Newcastle United We've been told the match goes ahead unless there are some major issues over the next couple of nights. \ue11cI'm pleased to see the Premier League going ahead, it's sending out the right message. It's a shame about the Tottenham game but it's understandable. It often goes unnoticed but football clubs do a lot of very good community work and are frequently heavily involved in social projects in their areas. Here at Newcastle United, for instance, we have our own foundation. I'm sure some clubs in certain communities will have important roles in helping to try and change things for the better now\ue11d Neil Warnock, Queens Park Rangers We've been told the match goes ahead unless there are some major issues over the next couple of nights. \ue11cIt would be a major blow not just to me but to everybody in the country. At a time like this you have to have an outlet. The Premier League is without a shadow of a doubt the best league in the world, not just in the country it serves. In our country it gives people something to do and look forward to. To let a few mindless thugs destroy it would be wrong. However, I do realise that people's safety comes first so you have to listen to what the police authorities finally come up with. If anything I think playing on Saturday will help the situation, it will put people back to normality and putting it off will be giving in to people who have shown just what they are really. I've been absolutely shocked and I think 99.9% of people in the country have\ue11d Steve Bruce, Sunderland We've been told the match goes ahead unless there are some major issues over the next couple of nights. \ue11cI think I stand for the whole country. We are outraged and shocked by what we have seen. I hope the Premier League gets started. In my opinion it would be wrong to let these idiots and thugs who are doing what they are doing disrupt everything. We will be guided by the authorities. But I echo what most people think and what most people are saying. I am saddened and shocked that our country could come to something like this. Brendan Rodgers, Swansea City It's obviously sad in relation to what's happening and We've been told the match goes ahead unless there are some major issues over the next couple of nights. \ue11cI heard the Tottenham game is off. It is sad that football is interrupted but we are preparing for the game [against Manchester City] and I was happy my players got through the international games last night and we are just looking forward and are really excited about Monday's game. This is a bigger issue than football, it is sad that socially that's where we are at. There was an image of a guy sitting down with his face covered in blood and people tried to help him up but were stealing out of his rucksack at the same time, which is incredible\ue11d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
