The original, included here, was a series of fragile duets with harpsichordist Tamar Halperin, while the new element is a live concert with Frankfurt Radio's hr-Bigband. The contrast turns Wunderkammer from an understated sound-voyage of tick-tocking piano motifs, pinging glockenspiels and regal harpsichords into a rousing concerto that won a 20-minute standing ovation at the 2012 Deutches Jazzfestival, where the live CD was recorded. From the intro to Kabinett II (opening on a charging harpsichord soliloquy and developing over deep brass growls and hard-whipped drumming) to the pin-sharp ensemble shouts on Kabinett IV, and from the thundering tenor sax that opens the Hexentanz section to the free-improv skitterings of its eventually rousing finale, this set cherishes the keys-focused purity of the original while significantly broadening and deepening its impact."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
