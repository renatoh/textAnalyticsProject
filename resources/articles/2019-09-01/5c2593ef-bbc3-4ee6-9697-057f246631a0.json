London Broncos deserve credit for taking this most remarkable of relegation battles to the final night of the season, but this was a step too far for a team who have defied the odds all season long. With London, Wakefield, Hull KR and Huddersfield separated by points difference alone coming into the final round, the most enthralling relegation battle in Super League history looked set for a dramatic finale on Friday the 13th. But by the time the Broncos had troubled the scorers here, their race - and one-season stay in the top-flight - was over. Late tries for Alex Walker and Brock Lamb added the hint of respectability London\u2019s season-long spirit perhaps deserved, but by then, they were 19 points behind and, finally, cut adrift at the bottom of the table. \u201cWe\u2019ve fallen at the final hurdle, but what an experience,\u201d their coach, Danny Ward, said afterwards. Nobody gave the Broncos a chance of survival this season, and the fact they have been relegated with a record points tally of 20 underlines how competitive they have been in 2019. \u201cWe\u2019ll regroup and we\u2019ll get on with the rebuild and try get back,\u201d Ward said. This was, in his own words, a game too far for this group: but while London fell short in their hour of need, how Wakefield rose to the occasion. Defeat here could have seen Trinity relegated depending on results elsewhere following a run of one win in 11 games, but they were near-perfect for the first 70 minutes here, establishing a comfortable 19-0 lead London never looked likely to overturn. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have asked for any more,\u201d Chris Chester, the Wakefield coach, said. \u201cIt\u2019s been the most challenging time of my coaching career.\u201d Wakefield led 8-0 at half-time courtesy of a try for Ryan Hampshire and two goals from the boot of the outstanding Danny Brough. The 36-year-old was at the heart of everything Wakefield did well, and after Brough converted Hampshire\u2019s second try to make it 14-0, his inch-perfect pass sent Reece Lyne over for another. The half-back then kicked the drop goal which, realistically, secured survival for the hosts - as well as Hull KR and Huddersfield, whose results elsewhere were irrelevant due to London\u2019s shortcomings. Their late tries from Walker and Lamb underlined how they will be in the mix for an instant return to Super League next year, but for now, they must head back to the Championship.
