A statement on the investment manager\u2019s website said dealings in Woodford Equity Income Fund were suspended after an \u201cincreased level of redemptions\u201d. It said the move intended to protect investors and give Woodford time to sell off investments, including in private companies. The suspension only affects the single fund, which has been the most popular among retail investors. Woodford\u2019s Income Focus Fund and Patient Capital Trust will continue trading. The City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority said: \u201cThe FCA is aware of this situation and in contact with the firms involved to ensure that actions undertaken are in the best interests of all the fund\u2019s investors.\u201d Woodford\u2019s equity income fund has shrunk by \u00a3600m in one month, including at least \u00a3187m worth of redemptions and the rest represented by a fall in the value of the fund\u2019s investments. The sudden outflows have helped slash the total value of the fund from \u00a34.3bn on 1 May to \u00a33.7bn by the end of May, according to data from ratings agency Morningstar. That compares with a 2017 high of \u00a310.2bn. A request by Kent county council to withdraw its \u00a3250m investment from the fund last week may have tipped the scales, according to reports. But the suspension means the council will not be able to access its funds until further notice. \u201cThis is a similar position to that faced by numerous open-ended property funds in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, all of which later reopened,\u201d said Jason Hollands, a managing director at Tilney Investment Management. \u201cWhile this news is clearly not going to be received well by those who might have wanted to withdraw in the near future, it is in the best interest of remaining investors that the fund is stabilised and not forced into a fire sale of existing assets.\u201d The suspension means that thousands of retail investors are unable to cash out of their investments for at least 28 days. Stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown announced on Monday that it was removing the suspended Woodford quity Income Fund from its Wealth 50 list of favourite funds, which is used to help customers choose their investments. It also cut Woodford Income Focus Fund from the list, even though it is still trading. The move is a blow to Woodford, as Hargreaves Lansdown just six months ago owned around 30% of shares the equity income fund, according to Woodford\u2019s annual report. Based on the fund\u2019s \u00a38.2bn value at the end of 2018, that stake was worth around \u00a32.5bn. \u201cWe are advocates of long-term investing and think Woodford\u2019s multi-decade track record remains compelling \u2013 but we don\u2019t underestimate the disappointment investors must feel with Woodford\u2019s recent performance,\u201d Emma Wall, head of investment analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown, said. The management company behind Woodford\u2019s fund, Link Fund Solutions, said: \u201cAfter consideration of all relevant circumstances relating to the fund\u2019s asset we have \u2026 come to the conclusion it is in the best interest of all investors in the fund to suspend the issue, cancellation, sale, redemption and transfer of shares in the fund. \u201cFollowing an increased level of redemptions, this period of suspension is intended to protect the investors in the fund by allowing Woodford, as previously communicated to investors, time to reposition the element of the fund\u2019s portfolio invested in unquoted and less liquid stocks, in to more liquid investments.\u201d The news of the suspension has come as a shock to the City, just five years after investors rushed to pour billions into the equity income fund at its launch in June 2014. Woodford, 59, was awarded a CBE for services to the economy in 2013 and surprised the City when he left investment management firm Invesco in the same year to strike out on his own. Having been in charge of \u00a333bn worth of assets at his former employer, he was known as the City\u2019s kingmaker, with the power to eject FTSE 100 bosses from their jobs through multibillion pound stakes. He garnered enough admirers during his 26 years at Invesco that many of his investors took their cash and followed him out the door. He launched the Oxford-based Woodford Investment Management just months later and got off to a flying start, attracting \u00a38bn from small investors and delivering market-leading returns. Industry experts say Woodford has been stung by bad bets on domestic stocks, which have underperformed after the Brexit vote. They include his investment in British outsourcer Kier. Kier\u2019s profit warning triggered a 41% slump in the company\u2019s shares on Monday hitting Woodford\u2019s 20% stake and reducing its value by \u00a337m within hours. Reports also emerged on Monday that Woodford was holding talks with the German publisher Axel Springer to sell his stake in struggling online estate agent Purplebricks. A spokesman for Purplebricks said the firm \u201cwould not comment on this kind of speculation\u201d. Purplebricks shares have lost around 70% of their value over the past 18 months alone. \u2022 This article was amended on 4 June 2019 to clarify the value of Hargreaves Lansdown\u2019s stake in Woodford\u2019s equity income fund."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
