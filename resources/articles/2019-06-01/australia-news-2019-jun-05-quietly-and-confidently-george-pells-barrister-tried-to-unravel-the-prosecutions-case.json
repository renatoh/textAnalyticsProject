Judges are masters of disguise. Baleful can be applause. Smiles can be the kiss of death. But the verdict at the end of the first day of George Pell\u2019s appeal has to be that the bench is listening to the case being argued on his behalf by Bret Walker SC with a little more than respect. Unusual features of the day\u2019s proceedings include the chief justice Anne Ferguson giving trigger warnings to the crowd before argument got under way, plus the phone numbers of Lifeline and Beyond Blue. Pell was in the box by this time. Life in prison suits no one, but the cardinal is looking fine. He was in clericals, not using his stick. He took notes. At a mention of him sitting on his throne in St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral, he closed his eyes in a little gesture of self-deprecation. Security had been tight for the crowd entering the court. We spread our arms and turned over our belt buckles. But did Pell really need the four prison guards in armoured vests sitting behind him all day? Were they there to protect him from his detractors or prevent him making a dash for the door? We learned a lot. Pell\u2019s accuser gave his evidence in private. The transcript will never be released. But after today we have more detailed accounts of the two incidents at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral that sent Pell to prison. And we learned for the first time that at his trial Pell\u2019s counsel, Robert Richter QC, took the tack of accusing the man directly of being a purposeful liar. \u201cI counted four or five occasions on which that line of attack was taken,\u201d said Justice Chris Maxwell who read the transcript of Richter\u2019s line of attack. \u201cYou went back and read the transcript of the committal, didn\u2019t you, and you realised there were gaps in your story, didn\u2019t you, and you invented new bits of the story to fill the gaps \u2026 \u201d Walker spoke quietly. Calm equals confidence. His task was not to sweep the judges away with a stirring narrative of innocence. That\u2019s for television. In real life \u2013 if that\u2019s what the proceedings of a court of appeal can be called \u2013 the job of great advocates is to pick apart the prosecution\u2019s case, to unravel their knitting. Which brings us to rule number one: appeals are essentially impossible to follow in all their detail. The crowd doesn\u2019t have the cartloads of documents parked around the court and lined up like mobile libraries behind the judges. \u201cCan I draw your attention to an incident in table L which I can amalgamate with table M,\u201d Walker asked the judges. They grabbed folders, found tabs and opened wide. We saw not a page of those documents. We\u2019re left to follow as best we can. What\u2019s clear is that Pell\u2019s fate rests on Walker convincing the judges that the jury last year was wrong to dismiss doubts they must have had about the case against him. Unlike many of his defenders in the church who rushed to publication the moment his fate became public, Pell\u2019s barrister is not arguing the jury\u2019s verdict was impossible. Nearly but not quite. The English language was ransacked by Walker to try to capture the difference: barely possible, extremely improbable, inherently improbable, so unlikely as to make it barely possible, not realistically possible etc. The theologian in Pell may have enjoyed all this and the argument that took up a good part of the morning about the difference between \u201ctrue\u201d and \u201ccorrect\u201d and \u201ccredibility\u201d and \u201creliability\u201d and the due weight to be given to the word \u201cmust\u201d in analysing the duties of the jury to entertain doubts about the prosecution\u2019s case. This might suggest the nitty gritty of Pell\u2019s case was neglected. Not so. Walker discussed the West Door Alibi; the difference between robes worn by an archbishop when \u201cpresiding\u201d rather than \u201cofficiating\u201d at mass; the polishing of the doors to the archbishop\u2019s sacristy; and the failure of Pell\u2019s accuser to mention, 22 years down the track, the school holidays that fell between having a penis forced into his mouth in December and his genitals being grabbed as he processed down a corridor in February. \u201cMay it please the court,\u201d said Walker as he sat down after a hard day\u2019s talking. All over the legal district of Melbourne, barristers were neglecting their work to keep an eye on the proceedings being livestreamed on the supreme court\u2019s website. The verdict of one or two of them: Pell\u2019s case has legs. But now the crown replies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
