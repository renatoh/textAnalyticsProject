During the 1980s, suspicion was not an unusual reaction, and bereaved parents regularly contacted our helpline, devastated and utterly bewildered not only because they had lost a much loved child but also because of the way they were being treated by police and other professionals with whom they came in contact. We at FSID have always acknowledged that in a proportion of sudden and unexplained infant deaths - a small proportion, according to the last major study of this subject in Britain - the death was probably caused by maltreatment. Child abuse may be misdiagnosed as cot death, but we worked throughout the 1990s with the various professional groups to raise awareness that, for the vast majority of parents, the sudden and unexpected death of their child is a terrible but natural tragedy. Gradually, calls to our helpline complaining of harsh treatment began to drop and we thought that mistreatment of cot death parents was a thing of the past. However, during the late 1990s there were several well publicised cases in this country and abroad in which babies thought to have died as cot deaths were subsequently found by the courts to have been harmed by their parents. These cases attracted huge media attention because of their rarity, and that which is rare began to seem commonplace. General suspicion soared once again, fuelled by calls from some professionals to \"think dirty\" whenever a baby dies suddenly and unexpectedly. Now we are back to the bad old days, with bereaved parents regularly calling our helpline in great distress at their treatment by suspicious, even hostile, professionals, who are terrified of missing another child abuse case and failing in their child protection responsibilities. It is an extremely difficult situation. The most recent and comprehensive British research available - by the Confidential Enquiry into Stillbirth and Death in Infancy, which analysed 1993-96 data from several areas of England - suggests that 6% of deaths diagnosed as cot death are probably cases of child abuse (intentional or otherwise). In another 8% poor care may have been a contributing factor. It is important that these cases are identified. But it is also important to recognise that in 86%-94% of cot deaths, families have just suffered their most terrible nightmare - the death of their precious infant for no obvious reason - and that to treat them as suspected murderers compounds their distress in ways that can hardly even be imagined by the rest of us. It is not at all uncommon now for the police to refuse to allow the parents to hold their dead infant to say good-bye, lest they \"contaminate the evidence\", despite the fact that the first reaction of virtually every parent on finding their child dead is to grab them up and hold them, long before the police arrive. In other cases, police have more or less evicted parents from the \"crime scene\", cordoned off the home, and not allowed them to return until they searched for evidence. And it is not only police; we know of one accident and emergency doctor who, when the baby was rushed to the hospital, immediately - and very publicly - pronounced that the baby had been shaken to death. This led to a chain of horrendous events for the parents; the parents felt that the public apology later printed in the local newspaper, following the confirmation that it had been a cot death, in no way made up for the accusation so publicly thrown at them. When a child dies, the parents may dial 999, rush the child to the hospital themselves, call their GP, or run for a neighbour. But, one way or another, they can come into contact with up to 13 different professionals in the hours, days and weeks immediately following a cot death, including ambulance staff, accident and emergency nursing staff, pathologist, coroner, paediatrician, social worker, and police. The police are the one constant, required by law to investigate every sudden and unexpected death, whether child or adult. They can be represented by a uniformed officer, CID, family liaison officer, special child protection officer, or all four kinds. Procedures vary tremendously in different parts of the country, depending on factors that include: - The wishes of local coroners (will they call an inquest or will they let the death be certified without an inquest?); - The views of the local police (do they think such deaths should be investigated by CID or do they think they should be investigated by child abuse specialists?); - The attitudes of pathologists (do they \"like\" the term cot death, or are they one of a growing minority who will not use that label, thus triggering different treatment for parents?); - The degree of interest in cot death of the local paediatrician (will he or she get involved in the police investigation or not?); - Whether the accident and emergency department involved is among those that have a procedure for what to do when a baby is brought in dead or moribund. It is essential both for the sake of natural justice for the child and for the protection of other or future children in the family that where abuse exists it does not go undiagnosed. But it is also essential that we find the right balance between the needs of the majority of parents who are innocent of committing deliberate harm, and the requirements of child protection. What we at FSID are trying to do is encourage standardised, comprehensive investigation of all sudden infant deaths, to minimise misdiagnoses, and maximise the chances of finding out why babies die, whether from natural causes (the vast majority) or not. We would like every sudden unexpected infant death to be investigated as thoroughly as possible by a multidisciplinary medical and police/forensic team working together to an agreed standard protocol, not only to distinguish natural from unnatural death, but also to learn as much as possible about the causes of natural cot death. We are currently working with professionals up and down the country to try to encourage voluntary adoption of multidisciplinary protocols that balance child protection and bereavement support for parents. And we are making progress. Thirty areas - some of them county-wide, others at the level of NHS trusts - have adopted such protocols. \"Think dirty\" is not the answer. Rather than suspicion, let us have sound information - comprehensive, standardised investigations of every sudden unexpected infant death, to leave no stone unturned in the search for answers to why nearly 400 babies are classed as dying for no obvious reason each year in Britain. - FSID's recommended protocols for professionals can be found on sids.org.uk/fsid/ - The Confidential Enquiry into Stillbirth and Death in Infancy (CESDI) studied 450 babies who died between 1993 and 1996 in the former NHS regions of South-western, Yorkshire, Trent, Northern and Wessex. Of these, 325 had been categorised as cot death. The study was funded by the Department of Health, the National Advisory Body for CESDI, and the Foundation for the Study of Infant Deaths"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
