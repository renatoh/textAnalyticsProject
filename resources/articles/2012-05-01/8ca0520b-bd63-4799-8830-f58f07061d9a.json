The news emerged ahead of the start of a two-day Nato summit dedicated to discussing the future stability of the country. The proposed troops will be in addition to the 90 British officers due to stay behind to train senior Afghan officers in what has been described as \"a Sandhurst in the sand\". It is the first time there has been a recognition that some UK troops will remain in a combat role, even if the vast majority of UK forces will pull out on schedule. A senior British official said: \"British forces will not remain in a combat role in Afghanistan beyond 2014. The majority of forces that remain in Afghanistan will be in a training and mentoring role, for example the Afghan Officer National Training Academy. But I would not rule out a small number of forces playing a counter-terrorism role This would be in keeping with how we protect ourselves from the terrorism threat emanating from other parts of the world such as the Arabian Peninsula.\" The training academy will also be staffed by Americans and Canadians with the intention of tutoring 1,300 Afghan National Army officers a year. Nato hopes Afghan security forces will have grown to 352,000 later this year, though their quality is questionable. Almost all 130,000 combat troops in the international security force are due to leave by the end of 2014, but key decisions on the speed of the pull-out and the composition of any remaining troops will not be made until the middle of next year. The timetable allows Nato to respond to the possibility of Republican Mitt Romney winning the presidency and then imposing a rethink on the withdrawal timetable. Romney's foreign policy views have yet to be fleshed out. Nato is hoping at its summit to announce it has assembled a $4bn (\u00a32.6bn) a year programme to help the Afghan government post-2014 to improve the resilience of the Karzai administration against Taliban attacks. So far Britain, Germany Australia and Austria have committed funds. Nato's planning has been disrupted by the decision of the new French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, to announce he is removing all 3,500 French combat forces by the end of this year, but Britain is relieved he has said troops will remain longer both to remove equipment and train the Afghan army. The French sector is due to be handed over shortly and in practice the French have not been conducting operations for some time in response to the killing of four French soldiers. It is also hoped that the Pakistani president, Asif Ali Zardari, will tell the summit that he is lifting the six-month blockade against Nato supply trucks put in place after US air strikes killed 26 Pakistani troops in November. Nato has also pressed Islamabad to do more to prevent insurgents from taking advantage of the porous Afghan-Pakistani border region to take sanctuary inside Pakistan. \"We can't solve the problems in Afghanistan without the positive engagement of Pakistan,\" Nato's secretary general, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
