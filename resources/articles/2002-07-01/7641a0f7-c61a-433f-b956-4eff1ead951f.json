When I moved between the clubs 25 years ago I was struck by just how massive Manchester United are. What hits you is the scale of the place: how big the stadium is, how big the welcoming party is when you sign. There were hundreds of people waiting for me and the press conference was larger than anything I'd been involved in. It wasn't exactly Maradona signing but I thought: \"Crikey, this is big business.\" The first few games hammered that home. In those days there weren't the same restrictions on travelling fans and I remember the phenomenal following at away matches. Of course you also got massive support at Old Trafford. That would be Leeds' biggest game of the season. Suddenly you're there at least every other week. The pressure on me was greater because I'd cost a British transfer record and it's the same for Rio now. Manchester United didn't want me to be the first half-million-pound player, so I joined for \u00a3495,000. In Rio's case they've had to hit the \u00a330m mark. You feel you have to play like the country's best player, which you're not. But you're welcomed with open arms by team-mates and fans at Old Trafford, as I'm sure Rio will find. I've no doubt he'll cope. He handled the \u00a318m move from West Ham to Leeds brilliantly and I don't think a lot fazes him. It doesn't seem that Rio will go on Manchester United's pre-season trip to Norway but on those tours you realise how big the club are abroad. Of course it's an awful lot bigger now than it was then. I think Rio will be taken aback by the reception. We went to places like Kuala Lumpur as well as Europe and the welcome is staggering. It was similar in Scandinavia. Leeds, Liverpool and Arsenal were pretty big in those places but Manchester United were bigger. Heaven knows what it's like for these guys now. Obviously Leeds fans are less welcoming when you've left for Old Trafford. The reaction I got was horrendous, especially through the mail. I'd been pretty popular at Leeds and won player of the year twice but I expected the abuse and could understand it. I'd signed a four-year contract shortly before I left and there was a column in Shoot magazine where I'd said: \"I'm at Leeds for life.\" I got about 100 copies of that through the post with notes and letters not wishing me all the best. I'm pretty sure Rio will get a lot of post as well. For four or five months after the move I lived in Leeds and I felt uncomfortable. I once made the mistake of sitting in the main stand at Elland Road for a midweek game and had to leave early because there was a lot of abuse flying around. The circumstances of my move were similar in some ways to Rio's. I'd just signed a contract and the club promised me they had plenty of money and were going to sign all the top players available, so Leeds would continue to be a great side. By then famous names like Johnny Giles and Billy Bremner had gone. A few months later they sold Joe Jordan, one of the top young players, to Manchester United. I couldn't believe it, I thought the club were heading in the wrong direction and put in a written transfer request. As with Rio there'd been talk in the papers of Manchester United wanting me. Manchester United didn't have as good a team then as they do now but they were always looking forward. I felt that wasn't the case at Elland Road at the time. Although Leeds were a big team and a big club, Manchester United were just so much bigger. At Leeds we probably had a far better side. We had won the championship in 1974 when Manchester United got relegated. Manchester United weren't the force they are now and it was Liverpool who were dominating. The expectation was huge but different from what Rio will face. We were trying to win Manchester United's first championship for years, whereas it's about maintaining success now. During my spell at Old Trafford I never got the trophies I hoped for. I won only one FA Cup but I had a great time there and I'm glad I went. The chances are Rio will pick up more medals and there's no question he has a much better opportunity of winning things now. Leeds fans might not like that but it's a fact. And there's something more to Manchester United. In my first press conference I remember saying: \"Ninety per cent of players would want to join Manchester United and the other 10% are liars.\" I expect Rio Ferdinand might go along with that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
