Iwan Tukalo is recounting the team talk delivered by Scotland\u2019s revered coaching double-act of Ian McGeechan and Jim Telfer at their hotel before heading to Murrayfield. It was, he believes, the \u201cdefining moment\u201d when hope was infused with conviction they could topple Will Carling\u2019s England and seize European rugby\u2019s biggest prize themselves. \u201cNormally it was a little bit like being back at school, with the teachers \u2013 the coaches \u2013 at the front and then our chairs set out in rows,\u201d the former wing says. \u201cThis time all the seats were in a circle and on the front of each chair was a jersey but you couldn\u2019t see the numbers, just the thistle. They said: \u2018Come in, just sit anywhere.\u2019 \u201cSo Geech gets into the circle and starts to talk to us about tactics, all the things we do when we\u2019re in certain parts of the field. Then he stepped out and Creamy [Telfer] stepped in. He started this whole thing about not just playing for the jersey but for yourselves, your friends and families, saying: \u2018If you win this game, it is life-changing for you.\u2019 \u201cAt the end he said: \u2018There is a jersey on the front of your chair; pick that jersey up and give it to the person it belongs to and make a commitment to them\u2019.\u201d At this point Tukalo, now 58, pauses to wipe away a tear. \u201cSorry, but that\u2019s how powerful it was, it still has that emotion.\u201d On Tukalo\u2019s chair was the No 6 jersey belonging to the flanker John Jeffrey. \u201cI just said: \u2018JJ, there\u2019s your jersey, I won\u2019t let you down.\u2019 For me, after that, nobody was going to beat us that day.\u201d Saturday\u2019s latest Calcutta Cup passion play will not lack for intrigue as both countries plot a route back from opening defeats \u2013 Scotland in Dublin, England in Paris \u2013 but even were a grand slam still on the line, it is doubtful the emotional pitch would reach 1990 levels. The patriotic fervour swirling round Murrayfield was fuelled by the political backdrop, with many Scots none too impressed at being used as a testing ground for Margaret Thatcher\u2019s hated poll tax before its imminent introduction south of the border. If England were characterised in the buildup as the embodiment of this arrogance and brutality, the Scots, billeted in the Braid Hills hotel on the outskirts of Edinburgh, were \u201coblivious\u201d to the off-field noise until the day of the match, according to Tukalo, who was sharing a room with the captain, David Sole. \u201cSoley is not the most talkative of individuals. The nerves were jangling and there was a deathly silence. So I said: \u2018Do you mind if I put the TV on?\u2019 It just so happened the opening credits of Grandstand came on. There was every Scotland-England sporting event that had ever happened, not just rugby but football, boxing and everything else. It only lasted a couple of minutes and then there was silence. We looked at each other and just went: \u2018Fuuuuck!\u2019 That\u2019s when it hit home.\u201d England\u2019s dominant form in the Championship made them favourites. Scotland earned narrow wins in Dublin and Cardiff but a 21-0 home victory over France bolstered confidence, as did the recall of only their second ever grand slam six years earlier, to the day, 17 March. Coincidentally, Telfer\u2019s birthday. \u201cI was there when Jim Calder scored his try in \u201984 against France,\u201d says Tukalo, who is behind plans to reunite Scotland\u2019s 1984 and 1990 squads at a unique charity dinner in May. \u201cWhen it was our turn to have the opportunity, to know it was achievable, those guys were an inspiration.\u201d Home fires were stoked further when Scotland ran out to warm up and found the England players\u2019 girlfriends being interviewed on the pitch. \u201cTalk about red rag to a bull,\u201d Tukalo says. \u201c\u2018You are on our turf, you have got no effing right to be there until the day is done.\u201d Scotland\u2019s slow walk out for the kick-off, led by Sole, is enshrined in rugby folklore. Tukalo believes its origins lay in their annual trial match two years previously, when Gary Callander, who led the \u201creds\u201d against the more established \u201cblues\u201d, used it as motivation. \u201cGary said: \u2018We are not Christians at the Colosseum being led to the slaughter. We\u2019re going to walk out there with purpose\u2019. It resonated.\u201d Finlay Calder, Jim\u2019s twin brother and a victorious Lions captain in Australia in 1989, harboured doubts about the plan. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really buying into it because you can look helluva foolish,\u201d says the former flanker. \u201cI did it for the first Test with the Lions and we got murdered but I played along and it worked out fine, didn\u2019t it? The whole idea was to destabilise them. It was a bit of gamesmanship. I can still remember when we walked out. It was a sense of there is a big fight on the cards.\u201d A spine-tingling moment on a day full of them. \u201cIt must have rattled the England players,\u201d Tukalo says. \u201cThe noise was off the scale.\u201d It went up several notches more when Tony Stanger, Scotland\u2019s other wing, reached Gavin Hastings\u2019 kick first to score the decisive try. Calder was alongside him, arms wide in celebration. The euphoria around Murrayfield reverberated far and wide, and not just in rugby circles. \u201cOne of my work colleagues was a Dundee United supporter and was at Tannadice on the day,\u201d says Tukalo, then a distribution engineer with British Gas. \u201cHe said people suddenly started jumping up and down and it was like a Mexican wave making its way to the centre of the stand. When it reached the PA announcer, he said: \u2018Scotland have defeated England at Murrayfield.\u2019 The whole place erupted.\u201d Strangely, perhaps, Calder recalls no great celebrations among the players. \u201cIt was more relief. We were professional in all but pay and we made huge sacrifices, to our families, to our employers. Some of us went down to Goldenacre [home of Heriot\u2019s rugby club] where there was a live broadcast going on. Others may have gone out but I was back at work on Monday morning.\u201d \u2022 Tickets for the grand-slam reunion event are available at heartsandballs.org.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
