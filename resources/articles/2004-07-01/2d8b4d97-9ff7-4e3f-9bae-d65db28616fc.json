Peter Hill", "bodyText": "Job: editor, Daily Express Age: 59 Industry: publishing Circulation: 884,120 (Dec 2003-May 2004) Staff: 300 2003 ranking: new entry Having breathed new life into the Daily Star, Peter Hill is now being asked to work the same trick reversing the tumbling circulation of Richard Desmond's Daily Express. He will be hoping that lightning can strike twice. Hill was voted editor of the year at the What the Papers Say awards last year after he boosted the paper's circulation by a third in three years to nearly 900,000 copies a day. But the Star's staple diet of stories about reality TV, scantily clad women, and football is hardly likely to have the same impact at the Express, where the twin obsessions appear to be \"bogus\" asylum seekers and the state of the housing market. Hill has only been in the job eight months but the Express is in need of a quick fix. In April its circulation had slumped to 882,000, nearly 20,000 behind the Daily Star. He has already began making over the paper in his own image. In April it switched its allegiance to the Conservatives after seven years supporting New Labour. A front page headline told Mr Blair: \"Enough is enough.\" A full page leader signed by Hill said that under Tory leader Michael Howard the party offered a plausible alternative government \"for the first time since the early days of Margaret Thatcher\". Hill's leader also touched on one of the paper's favourite preoccupations - asylum. \"Immigration is a national disaster,\" he said. \"Anyone who raises the issue is falsely branded racist... Unless the flood is curbed it will lead to chaos, public disorder and the growth of repugnant far rightwing political thugs.\" The newspaper veteran took the top job at the Express after former Express editor Chris Williams walked out to join the Daily Mail. Hill said he felt \"incredibly optimistic about the whole thing, even though it came as a complete shock.\" Of Mr Desmond, he said: \"Yes [he] can be difficult, but so can I.\" Hill joined the Star in 1978 after reading American studies and political philosophy at Manchester University in the 1970s. Unusually for a tabloid editor, he is given to quoting Marx and Hobbes and carries a lucky conker to ward off colds. But can it help boost the Express's circulation?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
