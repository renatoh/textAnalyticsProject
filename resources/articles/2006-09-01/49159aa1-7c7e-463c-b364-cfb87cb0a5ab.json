As the Australian enthralled Headingley one last time yesterday, you could have unearthed the most flint-hearted, ungenerous Yorkshireman in the place, the sort who would still bolt the door on an overseas cricketer, and he would have said: \"Course he is, lad. He's champion.\" Lehmann saved his best for last, an unbeaten 261 from 302 balls surpassing his 252 in the 2001 Roses match - Yorkshire's championship year. It was a fitting end to a glorious chapter in the county's history. Every half a flask of coffee or so the crowd stood in homage to an innings containing 43 fours and two sixes. At lunchtime Yorkshire awarded him a silver county cap. He began his final match with 8,532 runs for the county at 66.66. It is an incomparable record. Geoffrey Boycott averaged 58, Herbert Sutcliffe 50, Michael Vaughan has managed a mere 37. And Lehmann's runs have been harvested at 80 runs per 100 balls. But it is not only the runs, it is the ebullience. Never can a Yorkshire batsman have performed in such unbuttoned fashion. Off the field, strapping on the pads or leaning on the bar, he has shone with a straightforward, generous spirit. It is tempting to call it Falstaffian but, unlike Falstaff, Lehmann would never claim that discretion was the better part of valour. Yorkshire need more points than Durham in this match to send their opponents into the Second Division in their place, and 473 for three was not a bad start. Lehmann's innings was a six-hour feast of jolly, strong-arm drives and extraordinary manipulation. At the end he rolled off, grinning at the fun of it all, an immensely watchable batsman in need of a fag and a pint. Staggering, in more ways than one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
