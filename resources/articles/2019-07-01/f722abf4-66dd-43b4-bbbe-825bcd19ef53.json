The recent cluster of accidents and deaths, the worst on record in Queensland for 22 years, has prompted the state government to commission two independent reviews into mine safety. In the meantime, safety experts and the mineworkers\u2019 union have raised concern about the \u201creporting culture\u201d at mine sites, where most workers are now employed on a casual basis by labour-hire companies, rather than working directly for the multinational mine operators. \u201cMorale is absolutely the lowest I\u2019ve ever seen it,\u201d the CFMEU Queensland mining and energy division president, Stephen Smyth, told Guardian Australia. Major mining operations are increasingly staffed by workers without the security of a permanent job. About 60% are contractors working for labour hire firms. \u201cPeople don\u2019t think they can speak up. People think: how am I going to put food on the table if I can\u2019t get regular work? The workplace practices mean that workers, for fear of reprisals, won\u2019t stand up and speak out. \u201cSomething drastic has to happen. We\u2019re calling for a reset. The industry has got to take stock, because how do you keep doing what we\u2019re doing and nothing changes?\u201d Guardian Australia is aware of a recent incident at a large Queensland coalmine, where labour hire workers were instructed to operate bulldozers near a body of water, in similar circumstances to a fatal accident that occurred at a separate mine site in December. The experienced mineworker was killed when his bulldozer rolled about 20m into a body of mud and water on 31 December. Subsequently, the Queensland government made non-binding recommendations to prevent a similar incident. The most recent fatality occurred on Sunday. A 27-year-old mineworker, Jack Gerdes, was crushed and killed while trying to get into an excavator at the Baralaba North mine in the Bowen Basin. On the same day another man, aged 57, was seriously injured after falling about 10m from a platform at a coalmine at Collinsville. David Cliff, a leading health and safety expert, says modern safety standards meant all mine workplace accidents should be preventable. \u201cTo get one or two may be an aberration,\u201d Cliff said. \u201cTo get six is not an aberration.\u201d Cliff, from the Minerals Industry Safety and Health Centre, said high degrees of automation and larger machinery had resulted in fewer workers on mine sites, and workers who were required to perform more diverse tasks. \u201cYou need to be eternally vigilant. The key to fixing things is to predict the precursor events or situations before they become an accident. \u201cWe need to get a really good reporting culture with no fear of blame. If someone does something wrong, we don\u2019t want them not reporting it because they\u2019re afraid to lose their job.\u201d The Queensland Resources Council, in a statement on Monday, said that \u201cno death on a mine site is acceptable\u201d. \u201cIndustry is working on measures for a safety reset to refocus on safety in light of the recent tragedies,\u201d the statement said. Real issue in workplaces On Tuesday the Queensland mines minister, Anthony Lynham, went public to confirm that an advisory committee on mining safety had not met for four months, because it had been unable to meet state-mandated gender quotas. While the committee\u2019s inaction has stirred some minor political and media outrage, most in the sector acknowledge the real issues are occurring at the coalface, not in a committee room. Cliff said it was \u201cdrawing a very long bow\u201d to suggest the incidents were in any way linked to the committee. Smyth said issues with the committee were \u201ca smokescreen\u201d. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cThere\u2019s no way a committee would stop someone being killed. It\u2019s a beat up, they\u2019re missing the point,\u201d Smyth said. \u201cThe lack of experience, the lack of supervision, the push for production, the influx of labour hire. They\u2019re the real issues. \u201cIf I have an accident on the highway, I can be charged and go to jail. What happens with a multinational? They hire someone else and get back to business. The next CEO will get up and say safety is paramount. But they\u2019re all full of shit. It\u2019s a big machine and they just want production at any cost. \u201cNothing is going to really change until we change the work practices.\u201d On Sunday, as news filtered through of the most recent fatality and another accident, residents of the Bowen Basin\u2019s mining towns experienced a familiar panic. Most mines don\u2019t allow workers to carry mobile phones on shift. People could not reach their loved ones. \u201cIt flows on to their partners in the communities,\u201d Smyth said. \u201cWhen one person dies in the mining industry it has a ripple effect that runs through the communities. There\u2019s the mental stress of it all. It\u2019s just like one big pot. \u201cI was an underground coal miner, I get what they\u2019re going through. But I haven\u2019t seen morale as bad.\u201d with agencies"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
