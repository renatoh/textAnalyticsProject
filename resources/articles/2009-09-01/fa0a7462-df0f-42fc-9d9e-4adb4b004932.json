In his recent events Short has been notably strong against the Caro-Kann 1 e4 c6 featured below. All the Kolkata publicity was for Vlad Tkachiev's loss on time while drunk at the board. Other GMs have suffered from alcohol, notably Alexander Alekhine in the disastrous middle rounds of the 1935 world title match. In Tkachiev's case, jetlag was probably a factor as he flew to India with hardly a break after winning the French championship, and the drunk game was his only defeat in Kolkata. One of Short's potent weapons in his recent surge has been the anti-Caro-Kann strategy shown below, which he already used to beat Erwin L'Ami in the England v Netherlands match. It used to be thought that White's bishops were biting on granite in this line but Short's vigorous pawn advances (10 b4! 21 b5! and 27 d5!) showed that White can open up the position and smoke out the black king. Black missed the tougher defence 37...Rd8 and had to resign faced with mate or loss of a piece.
