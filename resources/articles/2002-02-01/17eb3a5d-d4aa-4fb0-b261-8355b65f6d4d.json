A rare display of sustained attacking excellence took Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's team to second in their second-round group with the promise, on this form, of a place in the Champions League quarter-finals. Bayer Leverkusen, the new leaders of the German league, were literally left standing by the pace and sweep of Arsenal's play. They simply could not keep up with the slickness of the mental and physical processes that enabled Dennis Bergkamp, Robert Pires, Thierry Henry and Sylvain Wiltord to draw and quarter their defence with an almost embarrassing frequency. Two early goals in two minutes, from Pires and Henry, all but settled the contest. Patrick Vieira scored Arsenal's third at the start of the second half and Bergkamp their fourth late in the match when he lobbed J\u00f6rg Butt, the Bayer goalkeeper, from just outside the penalty area. Zoltan Sebescen's goal for Leverkusen, scored from a tight angle four minutes from the end, rewarded the German team's attacking spirit but was otherwise an irrelevance on a night when a chilly Highbury was warmed to the cockles by such an awesome reminder of Arsenal's present form. With games against Deportivo La Coruna, who now lead the group after beating Juventus 2-0 last night, and Juve to come, Arsenal clearly have some crucial work in store. But the quality of last night's performance removed any lingering doubts about the ability of Wenger's side to dominate games at the highest level. Arsenal went into this match beset by a lengthening list of injuries and again missing players through suspension. Before kick-off they learned from scans that Giovanni van Bronckhorst had ruptured knee ligaments against Fulham on Saturday and would be out for some nine months. Wenger shored up a left flank deprived of natural left feet with Lauren, which might have exposed Arsenal to the pace and penetration of Oliver Neuville, who played wide on Bayer's right. In midfield the absence of Ray Parlour, after his dismissal in Leverkusen a week earlier, could have found Vieira bearing an unreasonable burden as he combined his protection of a weakened defence with the need to augment Arsenal's attack. Yet these things never became a problem and Vieira had a significant part in each of Arsenal's first two goals. Klaus Toppmoller, the Bayer Leverkusen coach, admitted his team had been outclassed. No one would have disputed that but he had surely reduced Bayer's chances by starting without Yildiray Basturk, whose profound creative play had caused Arsenal problems in the 1-1 draw in Germany. It was presumably in the hope of containing Arsenal's brisk, free-flowing style that Toppmoller kept Basturk on the bench in order to have the burly Carsten Ramelow patrolling the back of his midfield and keeping a weather eye out for Henry. Arsenal's response was to use Ramelow as a marker for a remarkable burst of attacking play which put them one up in five minutes and two up in seven. The first goal was simplicity itself as Vieira won the ball with a sliding tackle which at the same time launched Pires through a wide and inviting corridor in the Bayer half. The Frenchman outpaced a spreadeagled defence before driving a low shot into the far corner of the net. Arsenal's second goal was one to treasure, an immaculate example of scoring on the break. Pires, deep in his own half, appeared to be going to pass back to David Seaman but instead swung round to find Bergkamp, who exchanged passes with Vieira, then broke away through the middle. Bergkamp took the ball on at speed before sending Wiltord past the defence on the right. Wiltord's cross, low and true, offered Henry a tap-in at the far post and Highbury could have been forgiven for wondering why Bayer Leverkusen were top of the Bundesliga. \"This goal was everything you want to see in football,\" Wenger enthused, \"good passing, technique and collective spirit.\" Arsenal nearly scored a third midway through the half when Igors Stepanovs met Henry's corner with a header which Butt managed to tip on to and over the crossbar. Too late, Toppmoller brought on Basturk for a second half which had lasted only three minutes before Vieira did head Arsenal's third goal after Dimitar Berbatov, another substitute, had obligingly nodded on a free-kick from Henry. Thereafter Arsenal began to wind down but they picked up their earlier momentum sufficiently for Bergkamp to catch Butt off his line in the 83rd minute with a lob struck as the Dutchman was falling. The substitute Sebescen's goal was smartly taken but by then neither Bayer nor their supporters were in a cheering mood. \u00b7 Real Madrid became the first side through to the quarter-finals when they won 2-1 at Porto last night in their Group C match. Arsenal (4-4-2): Seaman; Dixon, Stepanovs, Campbell, Lauren (Inamoto, 83); Wiltord (Pennant, 90), Grimandi (Edu, 67), Vieira, Pires; Bergkamp, Henry.
