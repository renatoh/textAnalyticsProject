The coronavirus crisis has meant that most of us are shut in together and mostly just trying to get along \u2013 but even the best relationships can be strained. We know what that could mean: China\u2019s divorce rate spiked after its quarantine period ended with countless couples heading for splitsville. So we all need tips and advice on how to avoid that fate from those who\u2019ve figured out how to stay together, no matter what. Those couples who\u2019ve made it through in good times and bad \u2013 sometimes with help and sometimes with bare grit and determination. We\u2019ve already collected some great tips in our How we stay together series: advice like plan projects together like Warren and Kevin, be silly as suggested by James and Rebecca and remember there are always two sides to the story, as Marcia and John have learnt. And there have been plenty of other tips too. But we always need more so we want to hear from you. This is your opportunity to share your journey and advice on how to have a successful and lasting relationship. Share your story We\u2019re keen to hear from couples of all backgrounds and orientations \u2013 especially if your relationship is non-traditional. Tell us about what you\u2019ve learnt and we may interview you and your partner for our How we stay together series.
