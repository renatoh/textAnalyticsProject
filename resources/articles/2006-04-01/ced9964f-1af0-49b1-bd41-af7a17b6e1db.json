Foster's Twist, a citrus-flavoured lager, will go on sale following the World Cup and will be backed by a multi-million pound advertising campaign, brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle said. The move comes just days after S&amp;N paid \u00a3309m to Melbourne-based Foster's for the trademark throughout Europe, the Russian Federation and Turkey. The last big launch of a Foster's product in the UK was Foster's Ice more than a decade ago."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
