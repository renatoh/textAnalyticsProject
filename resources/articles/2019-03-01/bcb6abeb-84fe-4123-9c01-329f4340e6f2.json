Edwin Hardeman of Santa Rosa was the first person to challenge Monsanto\u2019s Roundup in a federal trial and alleged that his exposure to Roundup caused him to develop non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL), a cancer that affects the immune system. In the next phase of the case, the jury will weigh liability and damages, and Hardeman\u2019s lawyers will present arguments about Monsanto\u2019s influence on government regulators and cancer research. \ufeffDuring the trial, the 70-year-old Santa Rosa man testified that he had sprayed the herbicide for nearly three decades and at one time got it on his skin before he was diagnosed with cancer. He used the chemical to control weeds and poison oak on his properties, starting in 1986. Hardeman\u2019s case is considered a \u201cbellwether\u201d trial for hundreds of other plaintiffs in the US with similar claims, which means the verdict could affect future litigation and other cancer patients and families. Monsanto, now owned by the German pharmaceutical company Bayer, is facing more than 9,000 similar lawsuits across the US. The unanimous ruling on Tuesday follows a historic verdict last August in which a California jury in state court ruled that Roundup caused the terminal cancer of Dewayne Johnson, a former school groundskeeper. That jury said Monsanto failed to warn Johnson of Roundup\u2019s health hazards and \u201cacted with malice or oppression\u201d, awarding Johnson $289m in damages. Hardeman\u2019s trial has been more limited in scope. While Johnson\u2019s attorneys argued that Monsanto had \u201cbullied\u201d scientists and fought to suppress negative studies about its product, the federal judge barred Hardeman\u2019s lawyers from discussing Monsanto\u2019s alleged influence on research and regulations during the hearings. The US judge Vince Chhabria went so far as to sanction Hardeman\u2019s lawyer for bringing up Hardeman\u2019s \u201cpersonal history\u201d, referring to internal Monsanto documents, and explaining the process behind various regulatory decisions about glyphosate in her opening remarks. With Hardeman\u2019s trial limited to a strict discussion of whether Roundup exposure caused his cancer, his attorneys have argued they were facing a significant disadvantage. Monsanto has continued to argue that Roundup is safe to use and does not cause NHL. Although the judge restricted the first part of the trial to a limited discussion of Hardeman\u2019s cancer, he issued something of a rebuke of the company in one procedural order last week, saying: \u201cAlthough the evidence that Roundup causes cancer is quite equivocal, there is strong evidence from which a jury could conclude that Monsanto does not particularly care whether its product is in fact giving people cancer, focusing instead on manipulating public opinion and undermining anyone who raises genuine and legitimate concerns about the issue.\u201d Bayer expects to prevail later in the trial, a spokesperson said following Tuesday\u2019s ruling. \u201cWe are disappointed with the jury\u2019s initial decision, but we continue to believe firmly that the science confirms glyphosate-based herbicides do not cause cancer,\u201d spokesman Dan Childs said in a statement. \u201cWe are confident the evidence in phase two will show that Monsanto\u2019s conduct has been appropriate and the company should not be liable for Mr Hardeman\u2019s cancer\u201d. Child also argued the decision would not impact future cases, \u201cbecause each one has its own factual and legal circumstances\u201d. Jennifer Moore and Aimee Wagstaff, Hardeman\u2019s attorneys, said they were prepared to show the jury examples of Monsanto\u2019s \u201cbad conduct\u201d in the next phase of the trial. \u201cNow we can focus on the evidence that Monsanto has not taken a responsible, objective approach to the safety of Roundup\u201d, they wrote in a statement. Environmental advocates were quick to celebrate the verdict. Ken Cook, the president of the Environmental Working Group, said the ruling supported previous conclusions that \u201cglyphosate causes cancer in people\u201d. \u201cAs similar lawsuits mount, the evidence will grow that Roundup is not safe, and that the company has tried to cover it up\u201d, he added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
