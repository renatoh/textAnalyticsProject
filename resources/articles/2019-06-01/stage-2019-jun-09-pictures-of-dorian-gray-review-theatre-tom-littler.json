Just as in Oscar Wilde\u2019s 1890 novel, there is, in Lucy Shaw\u2019s adaptation, only one portrait that mysteriously reveals the \u201cleprosies of sin\u201d that rot the soul of Dorian Gray, even as his physical form stays young and beautiful. (William Reynolds\u2019s design frames water, lit by coloured lights, in a catafalque-like box, suggesting stagnation, refraction, reflection and distortion.) What gives the title its plural \u2013 and the production its singularity \u2013 is the multiplicity of its possible presentations. Director Tom Littler presents the text in four variations. Depending on which you see, the gender of characters will or will not have been swapped. On the night I went, Dorian was played by Helen Reuben as a young woman led into dissolution by Augustina Seymour\u2019s Lady Henry. Sybil Vane, the actor destroyed by Dorian\u2019s cruel rejection, was presented by Richard Keightley as an adolescent boy. Only Stanton Wright\u2019s Basil, the portraitist who, in striving to capture Dorian, achieves more than he realises, is gendered as in the original. In a programme note, Littler explains that there is no particular point to the reassignments, just a desire to pose the question: how and why does a character seem different if it is a woman or a man? Shaw\u2019s writing also suggests the shape-shiftingness of identity. Actors are narrators as well as characters; now in role, now relating the action or echoing fragments of leitmotif Wilde lines (\u201cto influence a person is to give him one\u2019s own soul,\u201d for instance). This conceptual approach is intriguing and offers some fine moments but, ultimately, it sags as drama \u2013 a sketch of Wilde\u2019s story rather than its portrait. \u2022 Pictures of Dorian Gray is at Jermyn Street theatre, London, until 6 July, then touring"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
