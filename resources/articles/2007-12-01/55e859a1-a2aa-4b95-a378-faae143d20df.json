'It was the first New Year's Eve I'd spent in England since I was 12 years old,' he says, on the phone from New York. 'And then I ended up spending the rest of my year there.' He's convinced that this is what he calls 'karmically decisive', and maybe he's right. Over the past 12 months Ronson has become a minor UK celebrity ('sometimes the paparazzi say, \"Hi Mark\", but they don't often take my picture'), and his 2007 personal highlights - playing Glastonbury and the Electric Proms - did not just take place on British soil, they were very British events. 'They were the highlights of my life, not just my year! Though I can't watch back the footage of the Electric Proms - I was caught in the moment and didn't realise I was so boring in between songs. Someone said I was like a mildly flustered flight attendant. I need some jokes.' Whatever, it was hard to get away from Ronson in 2007; if you weren't shaking a tail feather to Lily or Amy (he produced a couple of tracks on Allen's Alright, Still and much of Winehouse's Back To Black), you were chin-scratching or toe-twirling to the oompah tunes of Version, his album of covers. Version's schtick was classic songs (including Radiohead's 'Just', the Smiths' 'Stop Me' and Britney's 'Toxic') reinterpreted Ronson-style, usually in a horns-n-smiles manner. Various of his starry mates, like Our Amy, Robbie Williams and ODB, contributed vocals. And, unlikely as it seemed, it took off. That LP soundtracked everything this year, from Topshop to tapas bars. At least, it did here: America is yet to completely catch on. 'It's hard to make people understand that it's you behind the record if you don't sing. I'm cool with that - I get it. I had the same problem with my first record [Here Comes The Fuzz]. But for some reason, with this record, in England, it got more press. Like in the Sun, with the Arctic Monkeys talking about \"Stop Me\".' They hated it. 'Yeah. But, you know, at the beginning of 2007 the editor of the NME wrote that I had more talent in the tip of my dick than most artists. And now the NME have been blasting me for the last three months. It's kind of schoolyard. I don't know how it works.' Still, there must be compensations. His bank manager must have sent him a Christmas card this year. 'Oh no. Royalties take quite a while to come through,' Ronson demurs. 'There hasn't been a marked difference in upholstery in our apartment. Though I have got a projector screen that comes down from the ceiling. I like to watch movies with my dog and girlfriend.' That sounds quite cool. 'You want to know my cool moment for this year? I DJ'd at the premiere for the Joe Strummer film, and I saw the actor who plays Neil in (the US version of) The Office. I was so starstruck! And then I DJ'd at the Damien Hirst opening in New York and he was there, and he said, \"So you're stalking me, Ronson\". I couldn't believe he was even aware that we'd been in the same room! I took a picture with him.' Which sounds endearingly un-cool to me. Despite this, America is slowly waking up to Mark's talents, mostly via his connection with a multi-Grammy-nominated beehive babe. Famously, when Amy Winehouse made a passing comment about how her previous management 'tried to make me go to rehab, but I said no\",' Ronson suggested that she turn it into a song. Today he says he only did so because she was 'incredibly sober and together' at the time. 'It wasn't written as a \"fuck you\",' he insists. 'It's gimmicky, but it's strong. It's not funny to hear, like, Pete Doherty sing about drugs, you know.' He's meant to be working with Winehouse next year on her next album: 'We'll see.' Surely whatever he's doing will be determined by his New Year's Eve, anyway? 'I've not got a DJ gig booked,' he admits. 'I might rock up to a shitty bar on the Lower East Side with my records.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
