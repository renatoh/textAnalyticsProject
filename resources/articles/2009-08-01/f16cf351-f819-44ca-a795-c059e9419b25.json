Casualty, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation and New Tricks \u2013 three of TV's longest-running titles \u2013 recently ran with the respective subtitles No Fjords in Finland, Leave Out All the Rest and Fresh Starts. Such tagging \u2013 which has spread because of the rise of box sets and fan chat-sites, both of which benefit from differentiation \u2013 originates in US television, where Friends famously adopted a laconic labelling method reflecting the way in which viewers talked about a show: from first (The One with the Sonogram at the End) to final (The Last One), each followed the same formula. Desperate Housewives reflects its camp, showbizzy spirit by marking each part with a borrowing from Stephen Sondheim: a show title (Sunday in the Park with George), song title (My Husband, the Pig) or a line from a lyric (Sweetheart, I have to Confess). The Wire started with low-key B-film episode names (The Detail, The Cost), then became more lyrical (Moral Midgetry), and the tag given to episode four of series three \u2013 Hamsterdam, a drug-dealer's mishearing of a reference to a city with a liberal narcotics policy \u2013 became so resonant that it appeared on T-shirts. Among UK and US long-runners, only 24 fails to conform. Its writers simply look at their watches for inspiration: each week is merely called Day 5: 4.00am-5.00am or the equivalent. Channel 4's teen series Skins has the simplest system, naming each script after its central character (Tony, Michelle and so on). Listing magazines usually don't bother to print these, which may be why most franchises go for something more ambitious. But the result of this flourishing sub-discipline of TV drama is that writers, who often find titling hard, can no longer relax when they've named the series; now they must come up with dozens of other titles as well."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
