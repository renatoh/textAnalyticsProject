All the turmoil, the change of coaches, you've got this happening and that happening \u2026 it's definitely something of a first. There's nothing from my playing days that really compares. We were always very professional. We just all knew what we needed to do and went about our business as normal. There weren't any tours where we were worried about matters off the field or where things just didn't go right. It was: \"Here we go again. This is what we need to do to prepare.\" The current side have been a bit all over the place for quite a long time now, particularly with the India tour. They didn't play well there \u2013 they lost the four-match series 4-0 \u2013 and there was a lot happening off the field. It has all come to a head with Mickey Arthur being stood down and Darren Lehmann being appointed. In a way it was what Australia needed. The appointment does seem to have changed the mood around the camp. Hearing a few of the comments from the players and from people around the team, I don't know how good things were under Arthur. It got to be a lose-lose situation. With 'Boof' there I think it's a lot more relaxed. The boys respect him, he respects them and he knows how to get the best out of the side. From the start of the tour to where we are now within the team is probably a whole different feel. That's a huge positive for the Australian team. Between now and the first Test his job will be getting the boys to relax, to look at the positives of the matches they've already played and then telling them to get out there and enjoy it. That's the way 'Boof' used to go about things as a player \u2013 he didn't stress too much. He was a quality player who didn't play international cricket for a long, long time; but when he got there he made the most of it and always enjoyed it. When I was playing that was the main focus \u2013 you knew what you had to achieve but you want to have fun doing it, otherwise there's no point in doing it. The more you enjoy it, the more you have that love, that passion for what you're doing and you can't help but be successful. That's what he'll be telling the boys: we've had a real good lead-up; we're playing better as a unit. And the good news for Australia is that England and India are chalk and cheese when it comes to playing cricket. India's in the past and it'll be the last thing on their minds, a distant memory. That was always going to be a tough tour because the guys we had there, other than Michael Clarke, don't play spin that well. So, though it was disappointing, it wasn't massively surprising. In contrast a lot of the guys have played in the conditions over in England and they enjoy them a little bit more. Fair enough, they're playing a quality attack led by Jimmy Anderson but they have a little bit more confidence going into these conditions than they had in India. And getting Chris Rogers in, and especially Brad Haddin, brings that toughness, that experience that the team has been lacking since Ricky Ponting and Mike Hussey hung up their boots. Rogers, along with Shane Watson, is the way that I'd go at the top of the order, and Lehmann has said that's the plan. I'd have Phillip Hughes at three, then at four either Usman Khawaja or Ed Cowan, who is still hanging in there, putting scores on the board. I'd prefer to see someone between Clarke at five and Haddin in the order. In the past I was saying maybe David Warner but he hasn't played in the two county games, so perhaps Haddin comes in at six and opens up for James Faulkner, who has actually played quite well, at seven, with Peter Siddle at eight, and then James Pattinson, Mitchell Starc and Nathan Lyon. Even though Faulkner has batted quite well, Haddin at six is probably a place higher than I'd prefer to see him but the guys below him aren't bunnies and they've done well in the past so that might be the way that they'll go. I've been watching from afar to see how they've gone in these two matches against Somerset and Worcestershire and they're looking pretty good. Early on in the tour it's just important to get out there and get used to the conditions, get used to the different ball. Once you get the feel for the conditions, you get a bit of rhythm, everything is flowing well, then you can focus on the Test matches. You still have to enjoy the tour games. If you go out there and just go through the motions, you can easily get into bad habits, you lose a bit of rhythm or a bit of form and then things can go pretty bad pretty quickly. So you've got to go in with a plan: 'What do I want to achieve from this?' If you're a bowler it's getting overs under the belt, getting the ball coming out well, hopefully getting a few wickets for confidence. For batsmen you just want to spend time in the middle, get used to the pace of the wicket, get used to the conditions \u2013 and again build confidence. So those games are important for individuals but that's not to say the result doesn't matter. If Australia had lost the first two county matches, the media would've had a field day \u2013 everyone would. It's always good to get a couple of results under the belt. I liked the way they played in Taunton, coming back after a decent start from Somerset and then dominating from there. And they looked pretty good at Worcester, too. Yet for all those positives we are the underdogs here. The pressure is on England. They're under pressure to perform, while we've got nothing to lose."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
