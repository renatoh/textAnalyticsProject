Billed as McSweeney's v They Might Be Giants, it sounded vaguely combative, but there was no way of telling what it would all entail. A friend who is an Eggers fan declined to come along on the grounds that it might be 'annoying' and, as a self-consciously literary hybrid, it had that potential. The McSweeney's people wheeled out John K. Hodgman Jr, a self-proclaimed 'former professional literary agent' to set out the manifesto for the evening, something he managed not to do, although he was hilarious in his not doing it. A two-hander from Dave Eggers and TMBG frontman John Flansburgh was no more illuminating. Even the crowd didn't seem to know quite who they were or quite what they were doing there; for every literary type who walked in, Granta in pocket, there was a rock fan stumbling into their seat in the dark, unable to understand why the event had started more or less on time. Writer Arthur Bradford showed us a little bit about what the synchronicity might be about when he accompanied himself on the guitar while telling his bizarre story about a man who has sex with his dog, which later gives birth to his son, whom he later ends up accidentally killing. It was an awful lot funnier than it sounds. Zadie Smith's story was a music-free zone but lyrical in its own way, although when surrounded by the flashiness of the boys' writings (and delivery) there was a sense that her tale of frustrating lesbian love would have worked better on the page than the stage. In sharp contrast, Nick Hornby's chilling story of a VCR that can show the future stilled an auditorium occasionally made hysterical by the between-readings commentary of Hodgman as MC. Throughout the readings, They Might Be Giants broke into accompaniments, but most often took little strolls or sat with their instruments, waiting for their own gig in the second half of the evening. Their contribution really peaked, however, during Eggers's reading of Something Might Plummet. Something Might Soar , a beautifully delivered story charting a boy's passion for his neighbour, Mrs Gunderson. His ardour for the words of 'Mr Morrissey' almost equalled his stirrings for Mrs Gunderson, and when a Smiths song - the haunting 'Well I Wonder' - came on his Walkman, the band provided the sound effects, possibly the world's only cover version of that song. Eggers broke off to ask, 'Do you like the way we did that? The words and the music working together?' Once we knew what it was about, yes, we liked it a lot."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
