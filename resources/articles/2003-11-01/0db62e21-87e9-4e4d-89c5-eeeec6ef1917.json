The find came during a police search of a storage building known as the hangar on August 16 last year, after keys to it were found in the bedroom of the girls' alleged killer Ian Huntley. Plainclothes detectives had gone to the caretaker's home and told him they were increasingly suspicious of him and wanted to search his house and car, the court was told. Mr Huntley and his then girlfriend Maxine Carr were told they would be put up in a hotel if the search went on in to the night, but the pair were not arrested until the following day. The clothes were found by PC Timothy Wade, whose statement was read to the jury by prosecution counsel Richard Latham QC. The jury had already been told that the 10-year-old girls were wearing identical red Manchester United tops with \"Beckham\" and the number \"7\" on the back when they disappeared on Sunday August 4. PC Wade went to the hangar around 11pm with the keys and saw five yellow plastic bins as he began searching inside. The officer said he checked the first two bins and when he came to the third he saw that a rubbish bag had not been pushed down in to it, giving the appearance the bin was full. His statement read: \"I lifted a black bin bag out which was knotted, checking it. I checked the black bin bag lining the bin. It was empty. I removed it and looked in to the bottom. I could see something in the bottom. I bent over into the bin. I picked up something that felt like cloth. I could see it was the remains of a red T-shirt. \"I could smell a strong smell of smoke and obviously the T-shirt had been scorched. I could see further red material with similar writing and three small white training shoes. From the information I had been given about the clothing the missing girls had been wearing, I was positive in my mind that this was their clothes.\" The prosecution alleges that Mr Huntley murdered the girls within hours of their disappearance and dumped their bodies in a remote ditch near Lakenheath, Suffolk. They claim he cut off the youngsters' clothing and say a large pair of scissors were later discovered in his boot. Their naked bodies were discovered on August 17, the day after the charred remnants of their clothes were found in the hangar. Mr Huntley, 29, denies murdering the friends but has admitted conspiring to pervert the course of justice. Ms Carr, 26, a former classroom assistant at the girls' primary school, denies conspiring to pervert the course of justice and two charges of assisting an offender. The prosecution alleges she gave Huntley a false alibi for the day the girls went missing. The trial continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
