Alastair Campbell, for better and, many would say, for worse, was part of the soul of the Labour government. He was more than a media communicator; his personality was written into Labour's approach to power \u2013 bullish, sometimes misdirected, but unafraid to press on where others might have faltered. The new government paid him an odd tribute this week when it refused to put up a minister to face him on the BBC's Question Time; and though that decision was wrong, Labour would do well to ask why an unelected former adviser has proved a better and more controversial advocate for its cause than scores of lately discarded ministers. Today the Guardian begins the serialisation of extracts from Mr Cambell's diaries \u2013 being published in more complete form now that his party has lost power. They are, as even his detractors agree, compelling in their record of the minutiae of politics \u2013 the small human battles, the anxieties and contradictions that determine what happens as much as any grand public policy programme. But they are also characteristic of another political truth: that observations taken from below are more interesting than those made from the very top. Mr Campbell was of course close to the leaders of his party. But he was not one of them. Like Chris Mullin, a junior minister and MP whose diaries have been much read by incoming Conservative ministers, he kept just enough distance to record other people's absurdities. There was a time when every important former minister could count on a book contract, but now the public are growing tired of stolid political memoirs. Tony Blair is writing one; Alistair Darling, if he chooses to be waspish, might produce an unexpected hit. But by and large people want to read diaries. Perhaps a distrustful public hope that a contemporary account might be more honest than a retrospective retelling \u2013 though there is nothing to stop selective editing of the kind that means Chips Channon's political diaries are still sadly incomplete 80 years after the events they describe. But even this immediacy is being superseded by another. Mr Cambell used Twitter to mock the government over its refusal to confront him on Question Time. Perhaps he wrote a note in his diary too, but by the time it is public will anyone be interested? The alternative, of course, is to make the delay even longer. This November the complete version of Mark Twain's autobiography is to be published: he made us wait 100 years for unexpurgated truth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
