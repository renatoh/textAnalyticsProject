We therefore call on the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) to take the lead on this matter and consult on bringing in new measures without delay. There has been cross-party support for this campaign, including support from Theresa May, Jeremy Hunt, Anna Soubry, Sajid Javid, Jo Swinson, Caroline Lucas and Valerie Vaz. We believe the current process discriminates against women and acts as a deterrent to gender equality within Westminster. We also believe it sends a negative signal about how pregnant women and new mothers should be treated when they are working. With 54,000 women a year being pushed out of their jobs due to pregnancy and maternity discrimination it is important that Westminster sets the gold standard in how it treats new mothers. This change in policy is important for MPs and the diversity of the parliamentary workforce, but it is also important for all UK citizens; firstly because we need to know that constituents will be in receipt of proper representation but also because, by legislating for parental leave for MPs, the government will send a strong signal to employers that parents who work are valued.
