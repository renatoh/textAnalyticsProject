I can state clearly that this is not the case. I represent Breckland council as leader, and Thetford is our largest market town. Redundancies at the factory are due to an old and inefficient plant, which has been operating at a loss for many years, and both migrant staff and locals have lost jobs due to the closure. Our economy has benefited from migrant workers taking jobs that are difficult to fill, ensuring that many companies can afford to stay here. We do not agree with former mayor, Thelma Paines, who said: \"People will inevitably start asking why their taxes are going to support jobless foreigners.\" New migrants contribute through taxation, national insurance and council tax. Large numbers of Portuguese, Polish and Lithuanian workers have moved here, as you state. The football-related disturbance in 2004 that you report is not a true reflection - community relations are good and we work hard to ensure this. We provide English classes, joint sporting and cultural events, and our community associations and community liaison officers help people secure employment, training and local services. We agree that migrants are often \"on poorer terms - lower rates of pay, mostly just the minimum wage, less overtime money, less holiday, more antisocial shift patterns, uncertain hours\". As you suggest, there is a role for government to protect migrant workers and give the same rights to agency workers. The issue, however, is wider. The better that migrant workers are able to speak English, the less likely they are to be exploited. We believe the government should do more to meet increased demand for local services. The chief constable of Cambridgeshire has argued for additional funding and we believe this is an issue throughout East Anglia. The funding we receive is based on data from the 2001 census, which underestimates the migrant community in Breckland by at least 20,000. While the economic benefits of growth are clear, we must maintain public services and this means more money. Thelma Paines says: \"There are development plans and regeneration plans, but in the short term, it's bloody devastating.\" We disagree. The local job centre has been on high alert but reported only small numbers registering as job seekers. The difficulty with our economy is not primarily unemployment, but reliance on low-paid industries and the decline in manufacturing in general - this is not caused by migrant workers. Our work in building the local economy will benefit everyone. Thetford is planning for sustainable development and we are bidding for \u00a325.5m for improvements to transport, health facilities, schools, and up to 6,000 jobs. Work is already being done locally; all we need is more urgent national investment to support all of our community. \u00b7 William Nunn is leader of Breckland council communications@breckland.gov.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
