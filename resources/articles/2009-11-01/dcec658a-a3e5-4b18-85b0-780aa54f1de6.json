But Smith, having resigned as Oxford's manager the previous summer, was actually manager of QPR that day at Wembley, and the late Maurice Evans was in charge of Oxford. And relegation to the Conference (in May 2006) did not lead to \"the resignation of the unpopular Firoz Kassam as chairman\", as he had sold the club in March 2006. Apologies to readers of those editions of Sport that also inadvertently carried incorrect results for the Championship and FA Cup. A club once run by Robert Maxwell were perhaps always destined to suffer but the past two and a bit decades have, nonetheless, been a bewildering bleak time for Oxford United. Memories of that heady day in April 1986 when, under the chairmanship of Maxwell and the management of Jim Smith, they beat QPR in the League Cup final, have grown distant as financial problems and poor leadership have sent the team down the divisions. When they went out of the league altogether in 2006 it seemed then that the good times would never return. But three years on and the despair is starting to drift away. Oxford lead the Blue Square Premier League and will be in the draw tomorrow afternoon for the third round of the FA Cup for the first time in seven years following a 1-1 draw with Barrow. In the city of dreaming spires, they are imagining an early January visit to Old Trafford, Stamford Bridge or Anfield. First comes the replay with Barrow on Tuesday week, but Oxford will travel to Cumbria in a confident, defiant mood. They took the lead against their fellow Blue Square Premier side through a ninth-minute drive from Jamie Cook but then had to play the majority of the match with 10 men after defender Luke Foster was sent off just before the interval for pushing down Robin Hulbert inside the area. Andy Bond converted the penalty but neither he nor his team-mates could secure a winner after Oxford, despite their handicap, dominated the second half and were unlucky not to score again. \"The players showed that they will never give in, even when their backs are against the wall,\" said the Oxford manager, Chris Wilder. \"We deserve to be in the hat [for the third round] and are now looking to finish off the job at Barrow.\" If recent away days are anything to go by, Oxford will be well supported in the replay. Many of those who make the long journey north will no doubt reminisce about 4 January 2003, the day Oxford last played in the third round. They travelled to Highbury and caused Arsenal concern before the then Premier League champions eventually won 2-0. That was a truly proud moment for Oxford, particularly in light of what has happened to them since. Having staved off financial ruin following the death of Maxwell in 1991, the club went through a period of huge flux, with five managers hired in two years, including Smith who ultimately had the task of stopping the club from sliding into the Conference. He could not stop the long-term decline, however, and resigned soon after to take up a role as a director at the club that he still holds to this day. Relegation also led to the resignation of the unpopular Firoz Kassam as chairman but his legacy lives on in the stadium Oxford have played in since 2001. Holding close to 12,500, the Kassam Stadium is arguably the most eye-catching ground outside the Football League and is undoubtedly a gleaming symbol of Oxford's ambition to escape the footballing wilderness. Should they achieve that, the current owners, Nick Merry and Ian Lenagan, have stated their desire to take up the option of buying the site from Kassam for \u00a313m. If current form is anything to go by, that purchase could be undertaken next summer. \"With the history Oxford has, there is definitely a desire here to get back into the league soon,\" said Wilder. \"All we can do it keep on winning and I have confidence this side can go on doing that for the rest of the season.\" In that regard, the FA Cup is something of an unwanted distraction forWilder, but 23 years on from the famous victory over QPR, Oxford are only allowing themselves to dream of better times again."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
