Famed as one of the original Zap Comix artists alongside Robert Crumb but perhaps best known for his 1979 painting Appetite for Destruction, which provided both the title and cover art for Guns N\u2019 Roses\u2019 debut album, Williams is a West Coast art icon and underground culture legend. His fans revere him for his lurid psychedelic mash-ups of hot rods, hot girls and bug-eyed men, like a Tex Avery cartoon run riot, with lashings of sex and violence all wrapped in biting sarcasm. Yet despite its popularity, Williams\u2019s work, currently the subject of a major solo show at the Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery entitled Slang Aesthetics, continues to confound the art establishment. He has been critically snubbed and vilified for decades. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten a lot of bad write-ups in newspapers over the years and they like to refer to my stuff as \u2018kitsch\u2019,\u201d says Williams. \u201cWell, my stuff is way fuckin\u2019 kitsch. It\u2019s kitsch to an abstract level, you understand. It\u2019s fuckin\u2019 meretricious.\u201d Born and raised in the American south-west, Williams talks in a reedy voice that, befitting his reputation as a bad boy of contemporary art, makes everything sound like a sneer. Nevertheless, with his southern ways, he comes across as unfailingly polite and erudite, even when pouring scorn in the most scabrous of terms on those who would underestimate him. At 72, there is little sign he has mellowed or is willing to give ground. The art world at this point, he believes, is little more than a fight for the use of real estate: \u201cIf you can get into those big museums, in a big white room, and you\u2019ve got a pedestal, and you put a dog turd on that pedestal, that thing is going to be sanctified.\u201d Even if he\u2019s never been fully accepted, Williams, by his own admission, has always had one foot in the art establishment, whether they like it or not. His work was included in the 2010 Whitney Biennial. He was featured in MOCA curator Paul Schimmel\u2019s groundbreaking show Helter Skelter: LA Art in the 90s, alongside Mike Kelley and Paul McCarthy. Williams likes to boast that he was described as the \u201cnadir\u201d of a show that, while a huge hit with the public and now considered hugely influential, was critically reviled at the time. He was also represented for 27 years by gallerist Tony Shafrazi alongside Francis Bacon, Ed Ruscha and Jean-Michel Basquiat. Shafrazi, according to Williams, saw his charge as the next Andy Warhol. \u201cHe realised that I had a certain capability and that could be turned into an acceptable academic direction.\u201d But despite his gallerist\u2019s best efforts, Williams says he remains \u201cthe same asshole I\u2019ve always been\u201d. Shafrazi\u2019s belief in him is not as far-fetched as it may sound. For Williams has had an enormous, almost immeasurable impact on the art world not only through his own work but also through Juxtapoz, the populist art magazine he co-founded in 1994 that is still going strong today, for which he also provided \u201cdirection\u201d during its first couple years. Styled, he says, \u201cin the same flavour of the old surrealist magazines in the 20s and 30s \u2013 La Revolution Surrealiste and Minotaure\u201d, Juxtapoz quickly found its place, becoming the biggest-selling art magazine in the world by covering artists that none of the others would touch \u2013 artists who had similar concerns as Williams and were unabashed in their love for and inspiration from pop culture. In the process, he says, it \u201cpunched a hole in the wall\u201d of the art world that \u201cpeople could pass through\u201d. Cars and girls: a fascination Raised for the most part in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Williams had to create his own way in. Some of his childhood was spent in Montgomery, Alabama, where his father owned a restaurant called the Parkmore, then \u201cthe largest drive-in restaurant in the world\u201d. There, he was first exposed to the two overriding obsessions in his life: cars and girls. The roller-skating waitresses in hotpants who worked at the Parkmore and the girls in bobby-sox who frequented it became, says Williams, \u201ca fascination I\u2019ve never been able to slow down\u201d. His father, who had invested proceeds from the restaurant in a fleet of stock cars, bought Williams, then 12 years old, his first car, a 1934 Ford Coupe. Soon he would become involved in illegal hot-rod road races that became the subject of a 1976 painting. \u201cI\u2019ve always been in trouble,\u201d he says. \u201cI just socially didn\u2019t fit.\u201d In the 50s, in the south, he says, \u201cyou were a good citizen or a criminal, there was no middle ground there. So I early on related to beatniks, the bohemian world of letters and art.\u201d In the early 60s, he moved to Los Angeles only to study fine art at the Chouinard Art Institute. At that time, abstract expressionism was in vogue and, despite the fact Walt Disney and his brother Roy had bought Chouinard in 1961 to incorporate it into CalArts, Williams was upbraided for his commitment to draftsmanship and denigrated as an \u201cillustrator\u201d. \u201cThat was the argument that\u2019s always thrown up to me in art school. \u2018You\u2019re not really a painter, you\u2019re really an illustrator. You should take up illustration.\u2019 Well, yeah. What am I going to do, be a commercial whore? No, my work\u2019s as fuckin\u2019 valid as anyone else.\u201d A break came working as an art director for Ed \u201cBig Daddy\u201d Roth, the Walt Disney of custom car culture, whose most famous character, Rat Fink, re-imagined Mickey Mouse as a syphilitic, thrill-seeking, hot rod-riding reprobate. After leaving Roth\u2019s employ in the late 60s to concentrate on painting, he joined the ranks of contributors to Robert Crumb\u2019s groundbreaking Zap Comix, and found fellowship with underground comics artists \u2013 like Gilbert Shelton, S Clay Wilson and Crumb himself, who had experienced similar discrimination in art school. After a while, he says, \u201cthe hippie thing started getting so saccharine and so self-righteous\u201d. When hippy culture morphed into punk, Williams found himself embraced by a whole new scene in Los Angeles. He exhibited in makeshift galleries and venues in vacant storefronts in Hollywood that used art as a front to sell liquor in the back. \u201cI loved the music,\u201d Williams says of the punk scene. \u201cIt was just pure energy.\u201d The musicians, in kind, recognised the same thing in his paintings. Debbie Harry, who Williams once described as \u201cto the 20th century what Jenny Lind was the the 19th century\u201d, confided in him the story of her near-abduction by Ted Bundy, which became the subject of a psychological portrait he painted of the singer and her neuroses. And in the mid-80s, Williams was approached by Axl Rose, the lead singer of a then-unknown Los Angeles rock band, to use one of his paintings on the cover of their debut album. The artwork caused a furore and brought the band instant notoriety. \u201cI knew exactly what kind of trouble they were going to get into,\u201d he says. \u201cI laid it all out to them. And it happened just as I said.\u201d From the 80s onwards, Williams\u2019s oil paintings, while continuing to be rendered in his familiar style, became ever-more structurally complex. Recent work, such as the Death of Sophistication and the Death by Exasperation (both featured in the LAMAG show), are a riot of ideas and fantastical imagery, albeit rooted in specific concepts or idea that Williams wants to express, that follow their own internal (albeit helter skelter) logic to tell a story. His canvases are, in effect, like pages from a comic book with all the panels removed. \u2018Sophistication\u2019 a barrier to unfettered creativity Williams puts great stock in never having painted the same image twice or basing his work on anybody else\u2019s ideas. \u201cI have a great deal of pride in imagination,\u201d he says. This at a time when he believes that the virtues of creativity and imagination, along with craftsmanship, virtuosity, even the very \u2018thinking\u2019 that conceptual art implies, have all been disregarded and dispensed with by the art world. \u201cThey\u2019ve run out of everything,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a crucifix and a bottle of urine and canned faeces, and [someone] doing nothing, and a pile of sand in a museum \u2013 what is left? The only thing left is wide open use of imagination.\u201d The only barrier to unfettered creativity and imagination, he says, are the highfaluting ideas of \u201csophistication\u201d demanded by the art world. Until the advent of abstract expressionism, New York, the vanguard and the gatekeeper of art in America, was the first port of call for all the \u201ccanons of sophistication\u201d, as Williams terms art movements like impressionism, surrealism and dada imported from Europe in the early 20th century. By the time those styles crossed the continent and reached the west coast though, Williams believes, they had transformed into something else, something peculiarly American. In his view, the west coast developed its own popular art forms: \u201cIf you take into consideration in the last 30 or 40 years, the advent of psychedelic art, underground comics, movie posters, B-movie posters, the pornography industry, skateboards, surfing, tattoos, biker art, hot-rod art \u2013 all of that is west coast.\u201d This is the art and these are the cultures that have long informed Williams\u2019s work, along with things like EC comic books and the golden age of Warner Brothers animated cartoons. \u201cThere\u2019s no question in my mind that the greatest art of the 20th century was the cartoon,\u201d says Williams. \u201cNo other form of art has such a great and giant form of vocabulary than the cartoon.\u201d There\u2019s probably a good argument to be made that the cartoon is also one of the most influential art forms of our time. But critical oversight says otherwise. \u201cEveryone has a certain appreciation for cartoons, but no one really wants to think of them as \u2018fine art\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cThe obstacle that stood in the way of the cartoon is fucking sophistication.\u201d Maybe Williams can have the last laugh after all. The work of once-fashionable artists inevitably fades from view but, decades on, Williams and his dirty, funky, kitschy pictures still feel vital and remain very much in vogue.
