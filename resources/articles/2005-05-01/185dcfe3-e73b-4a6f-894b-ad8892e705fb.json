Three weeks ago, a company called UK Online launched the first broadband service to breach the magical \u00a310-a-month barrier. Its only downside is that it's restricted to just 4.4m households. Even if you are unlucky enough not to be close to one of the BT exchanges that UK Online offers its service through, the price of broadband is still falling across the country. Tiscali is offering entrants the option of a fast service, or a vast amount of downloading, for \u00a315.99 a month. Virgin has matched that price and doesn't require its customers to sign a minimum 12-month contract. If you already have a modem, there are some even cheaper deals out there. And if that wasn't enough, it is now even possible to go for a pay-as-you-go broadband. Which ever way you look at it - the days of the old 56K dial-up service look severely numbered. The choice BT says broadband is now available to 97% of UK households and in July that will rise to 99.6%. Most homes (bar those in the outer-most regions) can receive a \"standard\" broadband service at 512Kb - 10 times the speed of the old dial-up service. Whether you can take advantage of the higher speeds being universally offered by all the big providers will largely depend on how far your house is from the exchange. In short, the closer the house, the faster the service. Speeds of 1mb and above are only required if you regularly download large files or play sophisticated games. For normal surfing around the web and sending and receiving emails, a 512Kb connection should be fast enough. It must be noted that where a company offers a faster rate, it generally offers the slower 512Kb service as well. Perhaps the more pressing matter for those deciding on which package to go for, is the limit on the amount of information that can be downloaded each month. A few broadband providers don't have a limit, but most big names do. Whether you are happy to have a cap on usage will, again, depend on the amount and type of surfing you do. Light users who just book holidays, email etc will probably be happy with a service capped at 1Gb. Those downloading film clips, songs and the like will soon exhaust such a limit and would be better off with a larger package, or best of all an unrestricted service. To see how your usage rates, look at the table below - although it should be noted that some companies will let you buy more capacity if you reach your limit before the end of the month. The packages UK Online is without doubt the bargain of the moment and those lucky enough to be in one of its areas will probably want to sign up. Its \u00a39.99 package offers 512Kb speed and the service is uncapped. To find out if you are one of the \"chosen ones\" - the service is mostly offered in the more affluent urban areas - you need to go to its website (ukonline.net) and input both your phone number and postcode. The company offers a free modem and to sign up you need to pay a \u00a325 fee. It also offers a faster (2mb) service at \u00a319.99 and a stratospherically fast 8mb service for \u00a329.99 a month. However, if you're outside its area, a few companies stand out as offering the best deals. For those who already have a modem (or are happy to acquire one for around \u00a340) ADSL 4Less and Lixxus both offer the next cheapest packages at \u00a311.99 and \u00a313.99 a month - but these services are capped. Tiscali is heavily advertising its \u00a315.99 a month services that offers a free modem as part of the package. Customers can either opt for speed or volume - those going for its 512k get 30GB of volume. Faster 1Mb users are restricted to 2GB of downloads a month. Virgin's basic package is a good compromise - it also costs \u00a315.99 and offers 3GB a month, but unlike the Tiscali offer (and most others) it does not require the customer to sign up for a minimum of a year. In fact, there is nothing to stop consumers signing up, taking up its offer of a free modem, and then terminating the service by giving the required 30 days' notice, although a spokesman for the company said it was confident this would not happen in large numbers. Lastly, it should be noted that BT is not being left behind. It is, by some margin, the UK's biggest provider of broadband to residential customers with around 1.6m users. Its basic package, which comes in at a speedy 1mb (capped at 1Gb) costs \u00a317.99 a month, although it is currently charging \u00a315.99 for the first three months. Again, you get a free modem, but you also have to sign up for 12 months. It has the added advantage of being billed alongside your existing phone. Switching If you're already a broadband customer and coming to the end of the first year's contract - or you're unrestricted in your choice - there is one service that stands out. ADSL 4Less's start-up charges for new users (\u00a358.75) mean that those who are new to broadband will be better off elsewhere. However, it is offering very attractive prices for those able to migrate over to its service. It currently has a service running at up to 2Mb with a 2Gb a month limit for just \u00a311.99 a month. It is also offering an uncapped 512Kb service for \u00a314.99 - both incur a \u00a314.99 connection fee for those currently using another provider. m.brignall@theguardian.com Pay-as-you-go broadband If you are a very occasional user of the internet, but one that yearns for the speed of broadband, you might want to try a little-known-about pay-as-you-go broadband service. Lixxus' fast (up to 2Mb) service is aimed at those who don't use the internet very often - or are someone wanting to trial broadband without signing up to a set monthly amount or a year-long contract. It works in the same way as normal broadband in that it is always on, but you are only charged when you actively start surfing. A spokesman for the company says that someone looking at 100 pages on the web would typically pay \u00a31.18 including VAT. The more you download, the more you pay. Lixxus says that most of its PAYG customers rack-up bills of between \u00a35 and \u00a38 a month - if you are not using it, you are not paying. The only major drawback is that it (quite reasonably) doesn't give you a free modem - if you sign up for most contracts you get one free - although Lixxus can supply one for \u00a336, which includes two free filters. There is also its standard \u00a311.75 set up charge. If you find your usage creeping up you can migrate over to one of the company's other packages at the end of the month - without incurring any penalties. It has a basic \u00a313.99-a-month package, which broadly offers twice as much capacity than if you bought it as a PAYG customer. If you decide you don't want to continue with it, you simply cancel it at the end of the month and keep the modem. Users can go to the company's website to check at any time how much their bill is. The product is also price capped at \u00a325.99 per month for those who fear they may find the brave new world of broadband irresistible.
