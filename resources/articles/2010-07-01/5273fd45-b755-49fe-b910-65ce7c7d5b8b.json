The festival's response is to \"launch personal safety awareness campaigns for female fans\". There is no mention of the various community groups which mobilise men to work together in preventing such crimes. I'm tired of living in a world in which young women are responsible for the sexual violence of others. Rebecca Partos Brighton \u2022 If other councils saved money by joining Westminster and Hammersmith in combining their education departments (Report, 19 July), they could call it the Inner London Education Authority. Murray Ward Godalming, Surrey \u2022 The New Labour leaders can't wait / To publish their memoirs of hate; / They're selling their stories / Ignoring the Tories / Dismantling the welfare state (Labour contenders round on Mandelson, 17 July). Paul Francis Much Wenlock, Shropshire \u2022 The pope appears not to have noticed that the first apostles were Jews (Letters, 19 July), but also that some were married, notably the first pope, St Peter. Andrew McKeon North Rigton, West Yorkshire \u2022 Hockney confined to his studio (Letters, 20 July)? No chance. You'll find him out in all weathers on bleak Yorkshire roadsides creating massive canvases and wreathed in clouds of smoke. Angus MacIntosh Burley-in-Wharfedale, West Yorkshire \u2022 The British Lung Foundation website says deaths from respiratory diseases in the UK are almost double the European average, even though the UK has one of the lowest percentages of smokers. Perhaps Mr Homer (Letters, 19 July) should remember this next time he starts his car. Colin Warner Alicante, Spain \u2022 Where is this \"oop north\", where \"crux\" rhymes with \"crooks\"? It isn't in Newcastle, where nobody says \"oop\", either. But then I never got the joke about the Yorkshireman who went into a hotel bar to ask for a room and was given a glass of rum (Letters, 20 July).
