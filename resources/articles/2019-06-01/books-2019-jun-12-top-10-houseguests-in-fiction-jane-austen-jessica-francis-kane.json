The first is from Carmilla, the early vampire novella by Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu. I found the story in my parents\u2019 library, in an anthology of gothic horror, and scared myself half to death reading it. I still don\u2019t like vampire stories. The second is more benign: the children\u2019s classic The Wolves of Willoughby Chase by Joan Aiken. Both involve carriages rushing through the dark and the anticipation of change that a guest brings. Allegedly there are only two kinds of story: someone goes on a journey, or someone comes to town. Either way the person has to stay somewhere, so the houseguest story is everywhere once you start looking for it. When I asked on Facebook for favourite examples, I received a flood of suggestions, many more than I would have guessed and ranging across all forms, from plays (Albee\u2019s A Delicate Balance) to short stories (Gorey\u2019s The Doubtful Guest) to novels (Hartley\u2019s The Go-Between). My own new novel, Rules for Visiting, follows a woman as she becomes something of a serial houseguest, having set her mind on visiting, one by one, a group of her oldest friends. She is particular in her ways and wants to be a good guest, so she arms herself with the original 1922 edition of Emily Post\u2019s guide to etiquette and gifts for her hosts. Her greatest gift, however, may be her willingness to travel for the sake of friendship. Just in time for the summer visiting season, here are 10 unforgettable fictional spare-room residents. 1. King Lear by William Shakespeare From one point of view, Lear is a failed houseguest. After the division of his kingdom, he plans to stay with his daughters Regan and Goneril. But when they object to what he wants to bring with him (namely, a number of men and horses), he winds up homeless. A cautionary tale about assuming you will always have a place to stay. 2. The Fall of the House of Usher by Edgar Allan Poe The unnamed narrator of Poe\u2019s story endures one of the worst houseguest experiences in all literature. When he arrives at the behest of the ailing Roderick Usher, he has no idea what he is getting into. The ending supplies a great metaphor for a visit that doesn\u2019t go to plan, but I\u2019ll refrain from spoilers. 3. Howards End by EM Forster Forster\u2019s novel opens with Helen Schlegel staying for a few days at the country home of the Wilcox family. This sets in motion the social and romantic entangling of the two very different families. You don\u2019t get a plot like this one started with a simple day trip. 4. According to Queeney by Beryl Bainbridge In this brilliant novel, Bainbridge imagines the year 1764, when Samuel Johnson met the Thrale family and became a regular houseguest at their home in then-rural Southwark. In the novel, Hester Thrale gives him his own room, which he often doesn\u2019t leave. The scenes of the household functioning around the resident irascible genius are priceless. 5. Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen Austen\u2019s novels are filled with visiting. She wrote in an era when going to stay with family or friends was an established way for an unmarried woman to meet a husband or make herself useful to those who already had them. Thanks to a rainy day, Jane Bennet winds up a sickly houseguest and her sister Elizabeth must come to her rescue \u2013 initiating all the celebrated romantic attachments of the story. 6. There but for the by Ali Smith Speaking of guests who won\u2019t leave, in this novel, a man retreats upstairs during a dinner party and locks himself in the host\u2019s guest room. There but for the contains the best, most wonderful indictment of a certain kind of hostess I\u2019ve ever read. \u201cThere is lovely, lovely furniture in there,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is a really outstanding spare room in there. Everybody who has stayed there has told us so.\u201d 7. The Spare Room by Helen Garner In this gorgeous novel, a spare room is used quite differently: the narrator prepares it for a visit from her friend Nicola, who is dying. What follows is a muted battle of wills, between life and death, and hostess and guest. 8. Swimming Home by Deborah Levy Levy brings two English couples to Nice for a holiday and puts a stranger in their rented villa\u2019s swimming pool. Do they send her away? Invite her to stay? For various reasons, the stranger is given the extra, under-furnished room in the villa, and her odd but compelling presence alters everything. 9. Very Nice by Marcy Dermansky A swimming pool features in this delectable novel, too, Dermansky\u2019s fourth, due out in in July. When Zahid Azzam becomes the houseguest of the mother of one of his creative writing students, all kinds of boundaries are crossed. No one is entirely innocent in this addictive story of money, sex, and bad house manners. 10. For Friends Only by WH Auden This is really an ode to having a spare room and the only poem about preparing for houseguests that I have found. I love the end of the first stanza and what it says about the importance of visiting: \u201cThis room awaits from you / What you alone, as visitor, can bring, / A weekend of personal life.\u201d Face-to-face time with our faraway friends, something we too easily forget in this age of social media. \u2022 Rules for Visiting by Jessica Francis Kane is published by Granta.
