There is no room for the former captain Roy Keane, who was sent home from the World Cup after falling out with McCarthy during his team's pre-tournament preparations. With his eyes on the forthcoming qualifying tie with Russia on September 7, McCarthy has selected six players who did not figure in the World Cup finals in South Korea and Japan in June. They are the goalkeeper Nicky Colgan, the defenders Stephen Carr and Gary Doherty, the utility player Rory Delap and the midfielders Colin Healy and Stephen McPhail. \"This is an opportunity for some of the younger players to show that they are ready to stake their claim,\" said McCarthy. Harry Redknapp made the Derby forward Deon Burton his 10th summer signing for Portsmouth when he agreed to a month's loan with a view to a \u00a3400,000 transfer. Burton began his career at Fratton Park as a 16-year-old in 1993. Nottingham Forest have completed the signing of Eoin Jess from Bradford on a free transfer. The 31-year-old Scot, was one of 16 players sacked by Bradford three months ago when they went into administration. Bradford's manager Nicky Law has added Andy Gray, Paul Evans and Gus Uhlenbeek to his squad. Gray has signed a two-year deal while the former Brentford midfielder Evans will stay with the club until 2006. Uhlenbeek has joined on a non-contract basis but is hopeful of agreeing permanent terms next week. Birmingham have had their application for a work permit for the United States international Jovcan Kirovski rejected by the Home Office. They will lodge an appeal against the decision after the weekend. The 29-year-old former Wimbledon utility player Neal Ardley has signed for Watford, and goes straight into the squad to face Leicester City. Republic of Ireland squad: Given (Newcastle Utd), Kiely (Charlton), Colgan (Hibernian); Carr (Tottenham), Finnan (Fulham), Cunningham (Birmingham), Kelly (Leeds Utd), O'Brien (Newcastle), Breen (West Ham), Dunne (Manchester City), Harte (Leeds Utd); McAteer (Sunderland), Holland (Ipswich), Kilbane (Sunderland), Reid (Millwall), Healy (Celtic), Kinsella (Charlton), Carsley (Everton), Delap (Southampton), Keane (Leeds Utd), Morrison (Birmingham), Duff (Blackburn), McPhail (Leeds Utd), Sadlier (Millwall), Doherty (Tottenham)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
