Chanel\u2019s Camellia Water Cream is light but incredibly effective. I used a mix of foundations, but I didn\u2019t apply it everywhere \u2013 just apply it where you need it. For an even, refined finish use a brush. A dot of liquid highlighter blended on the cheekbones with a brush gives a beautiful glow. I applied concealer \u2013 using my finger \u2013 under the eyes, around the nose and mouth. I love Becca\u2019s as it is not too oily. Blend out with a concealer brush. I finish off with a dusting of powder, but only apply on the T-zone so the skin still glows. To create this look, apply black liquid eyeliner across the crease of the eyelid. Extend it out further than normal for a point of difference. Apply mascara \u2013 looking down on a mirror results in fewer smudges \u2013 only on top lashes for a more natural finish. Blot between your lipstick applications \u2013 two or three should be sufficient \u2013 to intensify the colour. For skin prep try: Becca Aqua Luminous Concealer, \u00a321; NARS Radiant Longwear Foundation, \u00a331.50; Fenty Pro Filt\u2019r Instant Retouch Concealer, \u00a319; Becca Shimmering Skin Perfector, \u00a330; Cr\u00e8me de la Mer Loose Powder, \u00a375; Real Techniques Brushes, \u00a319. For the makeup try: L\u2019Or\u00e9al Super Liner in Black Lacquer, \u00a36.99; Chanel Les Beiges Healthy Eau de Teint Water-Fresh Tint Light Deep, \u00a348; Bobbi Brown Blusher in Rose, \u00a320; Chanel Rouge Coco Flash 60 \u2013 Beat, \u00a331; and Stila Huge Mascara, \u00a312.75 The eyes have it: mellow yellow To achieve an intense pigment around the eyes, it\u2019s best to start without a brush. Dip your finger into the colour \u2013 it should be dry not wet \u2013 and press firmly into the skin all around the eyes. The pigment at the top of the lid should be the strongest. Then take an eyeshadow brush and feather out the colour in a circular motion. This gives a watercolour effect. Do this until it blends into the surrounding skin. Apply a subtle blush. Choose a soft, less intense hue so it doesn\u2019t clash with the pigment on the eye. Try: Huda Beauty Nude Love Lipstick in Sugar Mama, \u00a318; Chanel Ombre Premi\u00e8re Gloss Eyeshadow 067 \u2013 Solaire, \u00a328; Mac Blush in Raizin, \u00a319.50; Chanel Ombre Premi\u00e8re Longwear Powder Eyeshadow 34 \u2013 Poudre D\u2019Or, \u00a326 Green flash: emerald effect Take a medium-sized brush and wet it (but don\u2019t soak it). Swirl it across the eyeshadow until you get a paint-like consistency. A lip brush that isn\u2019t too stubby is ideal \u2013 Real Technique\u2019s are some of my favourites. Regardless of how carefully you apply, this colour will get on the base of your lashes \u2013 that is unavoidable. The way around it is to take a liquid eyeliner and apply it across the root of your lashes. This will hide any mistakes and give a professional finish. Try: Kat von D Ultra Ink Liner, \u00a317; Chanel Ombre Premi\u00e8re Longwear Cream Eyeshadow 824 \u2013 Verderame, \u00a326; Hourglass Ambient Lighting Bronzer, Harrods, \u00a348; Chanel Rouge Coco Flash 72 \u2013 Rush, \u00a331 Winning streak: red lines Mix a rich powder eyeshadow with water to create a paste, or use a liquid high-intensity pigment \u2013 Make Up For Ever is brilliant. Dip the brush in the paste and simply paint on the shape you want. A medium-sized lip brush is a good way to achieve this, however you can adapt the brush size if you prefer thicker (or thinner) lines. I did an extra lip prep before applying the lipstick. Nuxe balm is great as it hydrates, but is matt so it doesn\u2019t add grease to the texture. Try: Le Volume R\u00e9volution de Chanel 10 \u2013 Noir, \u00a328; Make Up For Ever Chromatic Mix in Red, \u00a312; Bioderma Sensibio H20 Makeup Removing Solution, \u00a310; Chanel Le Rouge Crayon de Couleur Mat 259 \u2013 Provocation, \u00a331; Nuxe Reve de Miel Lip Balm, \u00a310.50 True colours: rainbow eyes This is an opportunity to play and experiment. I applied the principle of a colouring book by taking colours and placing them, very specifically, wherever I wanted, making sure I didn\u2019t layer colours over each other \u2013 otherwise you lose the boundaries between shades. I used my fingertips to keep it looking unpolished. Where I wanted more detail \u2013 the green on the lower lash line, for instance \u2013 I used a thin brush for precision. I used light-reflecting pigments for this. The shimmer is important \u2013 anything too flat will look theatrical. You can use as many colours as your eyes will allow, but best to keep to four or five. Try: Anastasia Beverly Hills Riviera Palette, \u00a346; Chanel Les 4 Ombres Multi-Effect Quadra Eyeshadow 228 \u2013 Tiss\u00e9 Cambon and 306 \u2013 Splendeur Et Audace, \u00a344; Fenty Beauty Moroccan Spice Palette, \u00a354; Chanel Rouge Allure Liquid Powder 962 \u2013 Electric Blossom, \u00a331 Model Adesuwa Aighewi at Storm Model Management; beauty direction Funmi Fetto; hair Yoshitaka Miyazaki; fashion editor Jo Jones; fashion assistant Peter Bevan"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
