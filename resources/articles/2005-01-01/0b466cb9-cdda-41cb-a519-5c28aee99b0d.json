Blues manager Steve Bruce confirmed: \"We have agreed a fee with Newcastle and we've got permission to speak to the player. \"We will be having talks with him over the weekend and we hope we can convince him to come to Birmingham City. \"He's a quality player, quality players don't become available very often and that's why we've made the offer that we have to Newcastle. My board have backed me ever since I came here and they've done it again.\" Bellamy was left out of the Newcastle team for last week's defeat at Arsenal after manager Graeme Souness accused him of threatening to feign injury to avoid playing at right midfield. The Wales international striker admitted he had told team-mates he was going to pretend to have a sore hamstring, but then went on television on Monday to brand Souness a liar. Any chance of a reconciliation between the pair was dismissed earlier today when Souness confirmed he would never select Bellamy again. \"He can't play for me ever again,\" said Souness, \"he can't go on television and accuse me of telling lies.\" Portsmouth, Norwich and Blackburn have expressed their interest in taking the player on loan, but Birmingham are the first club to have had a transfer bid accepted."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
