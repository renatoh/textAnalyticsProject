Eurocamp and Keycamp both operate there, and you can also pitch your own tent/caravan relatively cheaply. It is very handy for both Paris and Disneyland Paris, as there are direct RER Metro trains every 15 - 30 minutes, which go through the centre of Paris all the way to Disneyland. The local station is a five-minute walk from the site, and there are supermarkets and shops there as well. The facilities on-site are fairly basic, but that's camping, and the superb location easily makes up for this. Jake Brodetsky \u00b7 Did you not realise there is a campground at Disneyland Paris? It has excellent facilities and access to the Disney shops, as well as a superb indoor leisure centre. We stayed there in '97 and had a great time.
