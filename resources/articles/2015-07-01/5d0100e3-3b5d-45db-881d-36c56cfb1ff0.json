Hundreds of young people gathered in central Belfast in and around Castle Street and Millfield at 5pm on Sunday afternoon, after details of the planned fight spread on social media. Northern Ireland police stationed several police cars and dozens of officers around where the fight was expected to take place, according to the Irish Independent. As young people arrived, police moved in to the area to prevent large crowds from forming, it reported. A statement released on the force\u2019s Facebook page warned that those involved risked a criminal record. \u201cTwo teenage girls have been arrested after what we believe was a prearranged fight in Belfast City centre. \u201cDisturbances were reported in and around Castle Street and Millfield earlier this afternoon. Officers responded and as many as perhaps 200 young people were found to be present having apparently been alerted by social media. \u201cWe cannot stress enough how dangerous and frankly stupid this business of prearranging fights is. Teenagers are risking not only physical harm but also a criminal record. This needs to stop now.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
