Detectives are probing the council's management and letting of its \u00a35.5m National Grid for Learning scheme, a government initiative to give schoolchildren access to the internet. In 1998 Lincolnshire county council awarded the contract to a Nottingham-based computer firm DataBase, of which the Tory MP for South Holland and the Deepings, John Hayes, was a director. But an internal audit found that tendering procedures had not been followed and DataBase had been shown unwarranted favour. Documents relating to the awarding of the contract had disappeared, making it impossible for auditors to evaluate the tenders for the project. A confidential report states: \"Unless appropriate explanations and missing documentation are provided to internal audit, doubts will remain over whether the authority has maintained proper standards of conduct to ensure probity and propriety within this project.\" Auditors found that although the tendering process did not start until April 1998, DataBase had been involved with the council in connection with the project since the previous November. The report reveals: \"A file note dated 21 November 1997 recorded that John Hayes (Conservative MP and director of DataBase) wanted the county council to work with DataBase to extend the project across the LEA [local education authority].\" After the contract was awarded, the company was told by a high-ranking council officer that all written and verbal communications associated with the project should be made to him at his home address and not the council offices. Mr Hayes told Societytheguardian.com that he was not sure if he had discussed the National Grid for Learning scheme with the council in his position as a Lincolnshire MP or as a director of DataBase. \"I can't remember the details,\" he said. He said he had been a director of the company but that following his election to parliament in May 1997 he had wound down his work with the firm, and by the end of that year had become a non-executive director. He resigned in December 1999. He stressed that he had not prepared the tender, presented it or negotiated the contract. \"The key thing is I wasn't involved in the process,\" he said. It is not clear why, when the internal audit took place in 1999, the police have only now been called in. A police spokesman said: \"We can confirm that Lincolnshire police have been asked by Lincolnshire county council to investigate a number of issues concerning the National Grid for Learning project.\" A council spokesman said they did not wish to comment at this stage."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
