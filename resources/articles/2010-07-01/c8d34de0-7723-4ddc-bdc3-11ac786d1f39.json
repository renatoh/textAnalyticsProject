It is about to be merged with that of nearby Hammersmith and Fulham \u2013 not a geographical neighbour, but a close ideological cousin. Penny-pinching, as opposed to continental peace, is the name of the game. But as the European commission has found, when executive functions are pooled but popular sovereignty is not, questions of legitimacy soon raise their head. The two Tory majorities may have a shared agenda now. If Hammersmith went Labour, however, the children could suffer from a messy divorce. The Westminster experiment is only one of several ways in which fluid politics and austere economics are re-drawing the established lines of local accountability. This week we learned that primary care trusts were for the chop, even though the coalition agreement had signalled they had a future. In education, while Michael Gove talks of local authorities \"holding the ring\" on particular issues, the great push for academies could see their role wither. In policing, by contrast, the aim seems to be to increase rather than diminish voter involvement, through the direct election of individuals to call the shots. So this programme cannot be easily characterised, as either pro- or anti-democratic. If there is one constant theme amid all the flux, it is a readiness to challenge local officials and councillors within their own borders. The Conservative wing of the coalition, in particular, seems more inclined to take school governors, doctors and the new police chiefs as the voice of their community, rather than trust any local authority to provide this. Many Liberal Democrats will find that uncomfortable. During the long years during which national power was a distant dream, they built up a base within the town halls, and advocated handing them more power. And, far from abolishing PCTs, their manifesto proposed making them democratic. The coalition has, it is true, handed councils new powers over public health, and freed their hand a little on decisions about expenditure, although latter amounts to little more than a freedom to cut. In a thoughtful speech yesterday, Nick Clegg suggested that Liberals should want to decentralise power, regardless of whether that power went to councils, community groups or public servants. But his claim that David Cameron's Big Society is merely another name for the Liberal Society will have worried many Lib Dems. Britain's political parties are not used to having to carve out a distinctive identity from within a coalition. They may find that tightly defined local fiefdoms are important in that task."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
