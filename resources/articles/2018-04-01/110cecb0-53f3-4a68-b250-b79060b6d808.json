Tully lays out the grisly anatomy of motherhood: from exhaustion and non-stop breast milk pumping to the overwhelming demands of a neglectful partner and the tantrums of the newborn\u2019s siblings. Salvation for Theron\u2019s character, Marlo, eventually arrives in the form of Tully, a night nanny. Cinemagoers without children will probably not have heard of these Mary Poppins-like figures, who are the subject of urgent discussions by many new mothers. Night nannies, or maternity nurses, will come to your house in the evening to spend all night looking after the baby \u2013 feeding and winding, changing nappies and soothing them to sleep \u2013 allowing frazzled parents some respite. Many promise to get the baby into a sleep routine and to train families in ways to make it happen. The number of night nannies has been increasing steadily, with several agencies providing maternity nurses. Anastasia Baker, a former BBC journalist, claims to have been the first when she set up Night Nannies in 1999 after her second baby. \u201cI approached 17 agencies and no one was doing it,\u201d Baker said. \u201cNow we have about 200 nannies working in London and the south of England.\u201d The agency has helped more than 10,000 families in that time, and demand is growing. Typically a night nanny will arrive at 9pm and stay until 7am at a cost of \u00a3155. If that only solves half the problem, it is possible to hire a maternity nurse who will be available 24 hours a day at a cost of \u00a3220 per day, plus a \u00a3100 agency fee. The opportunities for comedy are not obvious, but Julia Lannaman, who has been a night nanny since 2005, says there have been plenty of funny moments during her career. \u201cOne client had just had her first baby and she didn\u2019t know anyone at all with a baby,\u201d she said. \u201cShe gave me an empty Pepsi bottle and asked \u2018can we use that to do the feed?\u2019\u2009\u201d Another client asked Lannaman to travel with her on a family holiday to a Spanish resort \u2013 but things went badly wrong when they embarked on the return flight. The mother refused to remove her baby from a car seat and hold it in her lap, as instructed by the cabin crew. \u201cShe had a proper meltdown,\u201d Lannaman said. \u201cThe pilot became involved and we were escorted off the plane. We couldn\u2019t get another flight, so they hired a private jet at a cost of \u20ac25,000. The cabin was so small I had to be sedated because I\u2019m claustrophobic.\u201d Most of her clients are much more easygoing. \u201cI have worked for some lovely people,\u201d Lannaman said. \u201cTrust is crucial. When the client turns over a baby to you, they have to know that you will take care of it. You have to build a bond with the baby, and there are some beautiful moments.\u201d There is a serious side to night nannying, because it is a way of taking the pressure off new mothers \u2013 if only for a few hours. Sarah \u2013 not her real name \u2013 was told about night nannies by a midwife after giving birth at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London. \u201cI began going through a divorce in my eighth month of pregnancy. We ended up in court in my ninth month. I also have a toddler. When my baby came two weeks early, possibly because of the stress, I knew I needed help.\u201d She can only afford a night nanny for a couple of days a week. \u201cBut just having an extra pair of hands is so important. I need to look after both the children, so I need to have a sufficient amount of sleep.\u201d Susie Whytock, one of the first night nannies to work with Baker\u2019s agency, typically does a number of 24-hour shifts over a 14-day period to help cement the baby\u2019s sleep pattern. \u201cI met one client in Selfridges \u2013 she was a real high flyer,\u201d Whytock said. \u201cShe said, \u2018I\u2019m having a meeting with my colleagues on Thursday to hand over, I\u2019m booked in for a C-section on Friday, so I\u2019ll see you on Saturday ... let\u2019s see how this first week goes\u2019.\u201d By the end of the week, the second-time mother had gone through the hormone crash that affects many women and needed all the help that Whytock could give her. \u201cAt the end of the two weeks, she broke down. I could see she was in a dangerous place. I said \u2018I\u2019ll take you to my home for five days and you can stay with me.\u2019 It helped head off post-natal depression, and now she\u2019s like an adopted daughter to me.\u201d She knows that her services are beyond the reach of most women but feels that early interventions could save the NHS a lot of money. \u201cWhen I spot post-natal depression coming on I know I have to be quick to step in,\u201d Whytock said. \u201cCertainly, there are some dangerous situations that can develop that midwives and health visitors just won\u2019t get a chance to see.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
