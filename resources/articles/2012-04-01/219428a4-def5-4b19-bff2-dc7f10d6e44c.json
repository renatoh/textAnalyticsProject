Legend has it that the locals once tried to build a walled tower to stop the cuckoo, and hence spring, from leaving the village and it is this tradition on which the weekend's celebrations are based. On Friday night a storyteller reimagines the legend, but the main action is the next day when the festival takes over the village and canalside. Dancing, music, duck racing and the all-important cuckoo parade are followed on Sunday by Maypole dancers. Various venues around the village, Fri to 22 Apr Iain Aitch Alternative Fashion Week, London Embracing \"edgy and elegant\" while eschewing exclusivity, this offbeat yet influential free fashion-fest shows work by new independent designers from as far afield as Uruguay and Sri Lanka. So expect to see stylists and stallholders rubbing shoulders with \"stumbled-ins\" catching a spot of couture in their lunch hour, as daily catwalk shows and clothes markets descend on east London. A la mode meets ethical as models sport original and recycled textiles, with the whole event emphasising responsible sourcing. There's humour too; all the strutting comes with live music from jazz-pop upstarts the Mannequins. Spitalfields Market, E1, Mon to 21 Apr Colette Bernhardt Exeter Food &amp; Drink Festival Avoid that pesky tax on pasties by making your own; Darts Farm's bakery workshop is one of many hands-on activities at this West Country foodie fiesta. You can also create a cycle-powered smoothie, try a tantalising taste-bud test or take a masterclass in seafood cookery with Michelin-starred chef Nathan Outlaw. Other dining delights include \"sizzling demos\" at Exeter Castle, pop-up restaurants from local eateries and a grow-your-own area. There's also a lively kids' section with magic shows, apple pressing and a chance to see chicks hatching \u2013 assuming that no one tells them about the Dartmoor Kitchen's chicken and leek pie.
