HSBC refunded the money but reversed this a month later, claiming the transactions were performed on a secure website using a valid email address and password. It asked Amex for the transaction vouchers but hasn't received them so says this is not fraud. MJ, Reading Your complaint to HSBC went down the wrong track and was handled incorrectly. Instead of being investigated as fraud, HSBC treated it as a disputed transaction and responded as though you were requesting a chargeback. It has now investigated and found that, although secure codes were used, the fraudster reset the Verified by Visa code just before transferring your money to Amex. The computer used for this was not yours. HSBC again contacted Amex which can't trace the transactions but does confirm that you have no account there. The bank believes your computer was infected with malicious software that managed to obtain your security details but you are certain that it wasn't, as you regularly run checks. HSBC has now restored \u00a31,930 to your account and added \u00a3100 compensation.
