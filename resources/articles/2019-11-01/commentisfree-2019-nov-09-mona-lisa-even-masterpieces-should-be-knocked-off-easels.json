After the great mortal-coil-shuffling of 2016, which saw popular culture\u2019s most beloved icons checking out en masse, adopting the former as the brace position is reasonable, but these days, who knows? Cancel culture is always hungry, never sated. Last week, the Mona Lisa was cancelled. The New York Times art critic Jason Farago wrote a provocative and convincing column headlined \u201cIt\u2019s Time To Take Down the Mona Lisa\u201d. Farago called her \u201cthe Kim Kardashian of 16th-century Italian portraiture\u201d and said that she had become \u201ca black hole of anti-art who has turned [the Louvre] inside out\u201d. She was an attention-seeker who has caused terrible overcrowding at the museum and to see the painting up close is not even all that satisfying. I felt a crackle of pleasure upon reading it. I don\u2019t have anything against the Mona Lisa and have trekked around the Louvre to see her, though, to prove Farago\u2019s point, I can barely remember catching a glimpse. But it is wonderful to watch a sacred cow being put out to pasture. In an interview last week, the writer Andr\u00e9 Aciman was asked to rearrange the literary canon, and he chose to demote Virginia Woolf. \u201cMrs Dalloway is an overrated novel that I don\u2019t find particularly gripping or interesting. I\u2019m not even sure it\u2019s well written,\u201d he said. Mrs Dalloway is my favourite novel of all time, but even so, I applaud the sentiment. Rip it up and start again. I grew up in an era where the musicians I worshipped took pride in declaring that they hated the Beatles. To say you hated the Beatles was a sign that you were DIY and punk and wanted to smash the system. I was desperate to hate the Beatles, but unfortunately I\u2019ve only ever loved them, even when the piano heralds the arrival of Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da, a song so bad that John Lennon thought it rubbish. There is a fantastic segment on Greg James\u2019s Radio 1 breakfast show called Unpopular Opinion, in which listeners and guests take absolute joy in simply putting something out there. Star Wars is overrated; Will Ferrell is not funny; it is not necessary to wash one\u2019s legs in the shower. These small declarations of cultural anarchy are a welcome and rare thrill. PS. The ending of Dublin Murders was really annoying. God, that feels good. Eleanor Tomlinson: sounds like she got a Brum deal Eleanor Tomlinson, of Demelza from Poldark fame, could have been a contender in another BBC period drama, as she told Jonathan Ross on his chatshow last week. Having explained that she kept her corset from Poldark as a souvenir, for its jovial and light-hearted but actually-quite-bleak-under-the-surface memories (\u201cNow I can eat a burger and chips and be able to enjoy as opposed to not be able to finish it,\u201d she said), she also talked about trying out for, and being rejected from, Peaky Blinders. \u201cI auditioned for Peaky Blinders when it was first starting, but they said, \u2018You need to be able to do a Birmingham accent\u2019.\u201d That will be news to anyone who has seen the show, given that its dedication to regional authenticity has never quite reached the vocal cords of its actors. The cast\u2019s various attempts at a West Midlands accent appear to have been on a magical mystery tour of Wales and Liverpool via a stint across the Irish Sea. \u201cI tried and they said, \u2018You just can\u2019t do it, can you, love?\u2019\u201d Tomlinson recalled. With all due respect, how bad must it have been to be too bad for Peaky Blinders? James Dean: anyone for lights, camera, resurrection? James Dean has joined the likes of Tupac, Roy Orbison and Whitney Houston in the booming business of the digital afterlife. The actor, who died in 1955, has been announced as one of the leads in new Vietnam movie Finding Jack, which is, in many ways, so inspirational that it should have a curly-font Instagram meme made about it. \u201cDon\u2019t let half a century of death stand in the way of living xoxo\u201d, or something along those lines. The film\u2019s producer, Anton Ernst, has explained this casting decision with unintentionally hilarious justifications that sound as if they\u2019ve been ripped straight from Brass Eye. \u201cWe searched high and low for the perfect character to portray the role of Rogan. After months of research, we decided on James Dean,\u201d he said, clearly not worried about endearing himself to any actor he\u2019s ever likely to work with in the future. Chris Evans, aka Captain America, who was himself digitally rendered into a normal non-buff human being for parts of the Marvel movies, is one of a number of actors objecting to casting choices being carried out via historical pick\u2019n\u2019mix. \u201cThe complete lack of understanding here is shameful,\u201d he wrote. Like self-service checkouts, using old footage and CGI to recreate a long-dead star in a new movie may get the job done, or a job done, unless you\u2019re buying anything loose or requiring ID, that is, but it\u2019s never going to be the same as having a chat with Theresa on the tills. What is good for inexplicably maintaining the careers of people who died during the last century is not so great for all those present-day employees with human-being-adjacent jobs like catering, hair and makeup, and the people who drive those little golf carts around, yet somehow resist the urge to make racing car noises while doing it. \u2022 Rebecca Nicholson is an Observer columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
