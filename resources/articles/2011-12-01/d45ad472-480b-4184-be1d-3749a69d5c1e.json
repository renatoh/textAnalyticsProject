The striker was devastated to be dropped by Harry Redknapp at Stoke City last Sunday, having started and scored in the club's previous two Premier League matches, the victories against West Bromwich Albion and Bolton Wanderers. Redknapp, who will not face any disciplinary action for his alleged gesture towards Shamrock Rovers fans during Thursday's Europa League match in Dublin, had mused that it would be a \"big call\" to omit Rafael van der Vaart from the lineup, only to do precisely that against Bolton. But, despite Defoe's scoring performance, the manager reinstated the Dutchman for the visit to Stoke, when the team lost in the league for the first time since August. Defoe, whose club host Sunderland on Sunday, has made 12 starts in all competitions this season, with a further seven appearances as a substitute and he is the club's top scorer with nine goals. Emmanuel Adebayor has eight and Van der Vaart seven. \"It is hard to explain the feeling when you are starting games, scoring, the team is winning and you are not playing in the next game,\" Defoe said. \"There is nothing more you can do as a footballer. If you are playing well and scoring and, the most important thing, the team is winning, and you are not being picked again, it is difficult. \"If I am not playing well and I am not doing it, then I hold my hands up and say, 'I shouldn't be playing because I am not doing well.' But if I am doing well and I feel sharp \u2013 and I have never, ever felt so sharp \u2013 and my record is good and I am doing all the stuff I have done \u2026 \"I don't know. I took my chance two games running by scoring goals. That's it. That's all I can do. It's out of my hands. What can I say? I can just do what I have got to do and make sure that when I play, I play well. That's it really.\" Redknapp has insisted that Defoe remains a valuable squad member and he will not be allowed to leave in January, when Queens Park Rangers will head the list of interested clubs. But Defoe is becoming increasingly fearful about his chances of making Fabio Capello's England squad for next summer's European Championship. He has not played a competitive game for his country since September 2010 and he was left out of the squad for last month's friendlies against Spain and Sweden. \"I am 29, I need to play football. \"There is a tournament in the summer. I have been lucky enough to play in one tournament for my country [the 2010 World Cup] and I want to play in a tournament again because I know if I play in a tournament, I will do well. \"I am working hard in the gym. I did a lot of work in the summer to get to this position and I am not going to waste it by sitting on the bench when I know I should be playing. If I was about 21, I could sit on my hands. But I am 29 and I just want to play football now every week.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
