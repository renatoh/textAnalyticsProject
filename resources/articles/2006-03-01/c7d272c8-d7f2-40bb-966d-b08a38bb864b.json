That didn't diminish his passion for the former Yugoslavia, an obsession that he blames on cold war spy movies and childhood holidays in Montenegro. Since then, he has huddled in brutalist football grounds from Slovenia to Azerbaijan, Sofia to St Petersburg, watching innumerable matches while working as a correspondent for a now-defunct website and the Financial Times. Behind the Curtain recounts his travels and gives a little footballing history of each country, focusing on prominent clubs or memorable incidents. Wilson obviously retains a particular affinity with the Serbs: he writes an unusually sensitive character sketch of Sinisa Mihajlovic, one of the most reviled men in European football, and even admits a sneaking warmth for the Delije, the hooligans closely associated with Arkan. Describing his journeys through a series of places that most Britons can't even pronounce, let alone find on a map, he imagines a Serbian mirror of himself, doing the same thing in Britain: \"I hope there is a Serb version of me, delighting in his journeys from London to Ipswich to Blackburn, smacking his lips at the thought of another lukewarm station pasty and revelling in the poetry of the Tyne-Wear Metro.\" Wilson knows an immense amount about eastern European football and has crammed a lot of it into 300 pages. He writes well and has a lot of good stories to tell. I particularly liked his description of sneaking into a dingy casino to join a horde of Muscovites watching Everton play Chelsea, that \"great symbol of the new Russia\". But he never quite manages to shake off his anorak. As he says himself: \"I have even, God help me, in a bar in Ljubljana, discussed the form of Yeovil forward Phil Jevons.\" I was also frustrated by his refusal to step back and analyse what he has seen and learnt, rather than simply recounting it. Perhaps he'll do that in his next book. Franklin Foer (brother of the more famous Jonathan Safran) has bigger ambitions, both geographically and intellectually. Although he never really fulfils the expectations created by his title - he doesn't explain the world through football and often forgets to discuss globalisation - he has written a witty, insightful snapshot of world football, focusing on case studies in Italy, Brazil, Spain, Serbia and wherever else he happened to travel on an eight-month sabbatical. There's one obvious flaw with the book: his visits were brief and his research often feels sketchy. In several chapters, there's not a huge amount of information which won't be familiar to literate European football fans. (If you've already read Simon Kuper, Jimmy Burns and Alex Bellos, you'll find yourself skipping quite a few pages.) Even worse, you often get the sense that people have been pulling his leg. In a pub in Chelsea, for instance, he meets a bloke who boasts that he is the only Jewish Nazi football hooligan on the planet. His dad was an SS soldier, his mum was a Jewish nurse, and he was in the SAS. And he fought as a mercenary in Kosovo. And seduced half the girls in California. And \"practically invented\" English hooliganism. Yeah, right. When Foer does venture into less familiar (and more credible) territory, the book becomes much more interesting. There's an excellent chapter on Iran, revealing how football has been used a focus for secular nationalism. He has a good survey of Jewish involvement in football, including a stomach-churning description of a grotesque game in Theresienstadt concentration camp. He saves the best chapter for last: an infuriatingly short description of his own upbringing, describing why his liberal, middle-class parents, living in a prosperous suburb of Washington DC, pushed him towards playing soccer rather than basketball, baseball or American football: because \"soccer came to represent the fundamental tenets of yuppie parenting, the spirit of Sesame Street and Dr Benjamin Spock.\" Foer's soccer league handed out \"participation trophies\" to every player, no matter who won, and discussed banning headers so the kids wouldn't damage their brains. Today, rednecks watch American football while middle-class, dope-smoking, French-cheese-eating anti-war-activists watch European football on cable and wear Barca shirts in bed. This, explains Foer, is why \"people with actual power believe that soccer represents a genuine threat to the American way of life\". Football is a global phenomenon, played with the same rules wherever you go, decided mutually by an international organisation. Much like the UN, in other words. Or the WTO. Or any of the other busybodies which threaten the hegemony of a superpower. To \"American exceptionalists\" who believe that the US is above all rules and beyond all laws, a global game like football is obviously just an insidious way of imposing international laws on the Land of the Free. Subrata Dasgupta describes yet another foreign country, one which seems much more bizarre and distant than any Balkan republic: Britain in the 1950s. Dasgupta was six years old when he sailed from Bombay to Liverpool with his mother and joined his father, then working as a doctor in Earls Court. They moved to Nottingham, then Derby. He describes a dull, drizzly country, monochrome and uniform, where he could find no one else \"who was Indian and English, whose world was a kind of amalgam, a masala of both Indianness and Englishness\". Not only did Dasgupta develop an undying devotion to Stanley Matthews, but he retained \"a sense of immense aloneness, apartness, alienation\", living between two cultures, belonging to neither. He's written a sweet, sad memoir of finding a kind of home in his love of football, then losing it again when he was 13 and his parents took him back to India. \u00b7 Josh Lacey's God is Brazilian is published by Tempus.
