Amarjit Chohan, 46, his 25-year-old wife, Nancy, their sons, Ravinder, eight weeks, and 18-month-old Devinder, and Mrs Chohan's mother, Charanjit Kaur, 51, were killed by the ruthless gang who wanted to take over Mr Chohan's haulage business, Ciba Freight, and use it to smuggle drugs. The family were kidnapped from their west London home, slaughtered and buried on a Devon estate. But the gang later dug up the corpses and dumped them at sea. The adults' remains were eventually recovered. The children's bodies have never been found. But the Guardian can reveal that Kenneth Regan, the career criminal behind the plot, was also a supergrass, who would not have been able to kill the Chohans if he had not been released early from prison because he gave vital testimony which helped convict fellow gangsters Regan, who has a long history of drug dealing, money laundering and passport fraud, was convicted in 1999 of heroin dealing and injuring a policewoman by running his car into her while trying to escape. But he swapped a 20-year sentence for eight years by turning Queen's evidence against his former associates. A dozen top criminals were convicted and millions of pounds of drug money confiscated on Regan's information and he was freed after three years. He muscled in on Ciba in July 2002 and eight months later the Chohans were dead. Detective Chief Inspector Dave Little, who headed the Scotland Yard investigation, said: \"Kenneth Regan is the most ruthless man I ever met. He wiped out an entire family through sheer greed. He was utterly without a conscience and he showed no remorse. \" But Mrs Chohan's brother, Onkar Verma, told the Guardian he was critical of police for a catalogue of errors that almost allowed the murderers to get away with their crimes. He said officers had fallen for Regan's web of deceit aimed at making it look like Mr Chohan had run away, instead of checking Regan's background. Mr Verma said he had to fly from New Zealand to demand the disappearances be treated as suspicious. Regan first lured Mr Chohan to a meeting near Stonehenge, tortured him to sign blank sheets of paper on which he later typed letters claiming the freight boss had fled the country and was handing the company over to him. But he realised he would have to kill the entire family to make the story credible. The gang did their utmost to cover their tracks, but a single drop of blood outside Regan's house was identified as Devinder's and a note addressed to Regan found in Mr Chohan's sock proved crucial. Regan, 56, showed no emotion as he and William Horncy, 53, were found guilty at the Old Bailey of the kidnap, false imprisonment and murder of all five victims. Peter Rees, 38, was convicted of the murder and false imprisonment of Amarjit Chohan. They will be sentenced next Tuesday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
