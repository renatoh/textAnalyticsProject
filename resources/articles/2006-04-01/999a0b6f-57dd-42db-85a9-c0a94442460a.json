Was the address correct? Does your intended recipient check that address regularly? Or might it have somehow been junked as spam? You probably didn't worry, though, whether sending that message would lead to a two-tier internet in which you would have to pay for your messages to be received; and in which some messages would receive favourable treatment, being express-delivered to the inboxes of people who might not have asked for them. But some people are deeply concerned about exactly that. The process by which \"paid-for\" emails could lead to a two-tier internet will be the topic of a debate tonight in California between Esther Dyson, editor of Release 1.0 for CNet Networks, who favours paid-for email delivery, and Danny O'Brien, of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), who will argue that the effects of such initiatives could spread far and wide until they engulf the \"neutral\" internet that we like to think exists now - and so must be stopped. And the argument over email is a microcosm of far larger disagreements about who should pay for what online, and whether the present model for internet economies - which turn many of the economic models we are used to offline on their heads - are viable. The argument about email has been simmering since AOL announced in February that it would be using the services of a firm called Goodmail. It guarantees the delivery of bulk emails for a fee of $2 to $3 per thousand, payable by the organisations sending them, which would be vetted beforehand. Their emails would arrive with an inline logo, guaranteeing their content as not being spam or phishing - at least by Goodmail's lights. Critics called it paid-for spam, saying AOL and Goodmail were creating a revenue stream for themselves in which customers would have to endure unwanted messages, while other messages they did want would increasingly be blocked by AOL's spam filters - creating a world where you'd have to pay to get someone to see an email that they wanted. AOL countered that it would keep plenty of avenues open for bulk-mailing organisations such as charities to reach its customers. \"This is all about protecting consumers from spam, phishing, viruses and fraud,\" said Richard Gingras, chief executive of Goodmail. Block busting The debate abruptly reached a head last week with the discovery that AOL was (almost certainly accidentally) blocking emails containing a link to dearaol.com, the site where the EFF has set up an online letter and petition asking people to oppose AOL's policy. Send an email without the dearaol.com link, and it would arrive; send it with the link, and the message would bounce back to the sender. Suspicions were heightened when the problem disappeared just 20 minutes after the EFF put out a press release about it. So is Goodmail and its principle of making people pay to send emails a bad idea? Dyson argues that the maturation of the internet - and, in particular, of online threats - makes such payment systems inevitable. She says opponents of \"sender-pays\" schemes are being naive. \"[They] seem to think that all internet mail must always be free, just because it was free before. Yet they pay for computers and internet access and office supplies,\" she argued in an article in the New York Times last month (available on her website at www.tinyurl.com/fgjxg. Dyson said that services like Goodmail are now necessary. \"It's idealistic and unrealistic in a world where there are bad people; you need to spend money to protect yourself. At the moment, the costs have to be borne by the recipient. Really you want to charge through third parties [such as Goodmail] who can work together with ISPs.\" She thinks Goodmail is \"better, but not best\" in terms of solving what she sees as the email problem. \"At least one start-up is coming on Thursday [to the debate] - they use a system where the recipient gets money.\" Despite scientists and engineers being among her opponents, she compared them to advocates of \"intelligent design\" (the anti-scientific idea that the universe had a \"designer\"). \"People who are anti-Goodmail say, 'Let's have an intelligent design for anti-spam systems',\" she says. \"I believe in evolution: there will be a lot of different attempts, and some will work and some won't, and the best will thrive.\" The weakness in this argument is that the internet was definitely designed, by humans. And it's exploited by them, too. Indeed, the driving force behind Goodmail is the high level of spam and the growing volume of phishing. Arguably, Bill Gates blessed such anti-spam projects by proxy when in 2004 he told the Davos conference that \"two years from now, spam will be solved\", and suggested systems whereby senders would have to get their computers to solve cryptographic puzzles, or \"pay\" a certain amount of (refundable) money, or work within a system where mail servers verified the identity of a server. Only the last has appeared, and only to a limited extent. Spam challenge systems have proliferated, and spam-trapping is now pervasive. But it can cause tremendous problems. In the UK, NTL last year began using Sorbs, which claims to identify \"rogue\" servers being used to send spam, and blacklist them. Unfortunately, as a long discussion on the Ask Jack blog demonstrated in January, emails sent from addresses such as hotmail.com silently failed to reach their destination. That caused a great deal of consternation - and anger that NTL had not told its customers or given them the option of allowing particular emails (see www.tinyurl.com/h3xa4) AOL, too, labels as \"probable spam\" messages from websites with \"registration\" links and URLs. BT uses Yahoo's spam-blocking system, which uses a Sorbs-like method that automatically marks as spam any email that comes directly from a PC, rather than going through an ISP or other mail server. Users, too, have a multitude of methods to defeat spam, with filtering programs such as Mailwasher, Spam Assassin, Post Armor or POP Monitor, which they can tailor to their needs. But none of these products has turned back the tide of spam. According to Postini, a mail-filtering service, spam makes up 82.5% of all email it sees. The argument about email is a microcosm of the debate about \"network neutrality\" - whether organisations responsible for the passage of internet data should have the right to pick and choose which get preferential treatment. It has already surfaced over the issue of telephone calls made via the internet (Trouble on the line, April 6), where cable providers argue that they should be able to block some calls to favour their own service. The same argument has begun about video over the net, as cable companies in the US - which also provide broadband services - contend that they should be able to give preference to their internet-delivered video, rather than having to treat all-comers equally as the law compels them to. The chief executive of AT&amp;T, Ed Whitacre, put this view to Business Week magazine last November (www.tinyurl.com/j3q99): \"Why should [Google et al] be allowed to use my pipes? The internet can't be free in that sense, because we and the cable companies have made an investment, and for a Google or Yahoo! or Vonage or anybody to expect to use these pipes [for] free is nuts!\" AT&amp;T was then completing a $67bn merger with BellSouth to create the US's largest telecoms company. Many people were outraged that he should think customers who had already paid for internet access should be denied access to online services without a behind-the-scenes payment to AT&amp;T from companies like Google. Email economics Spam may be too intractable and embedded a problem to yield to simple solutions. Dyson suggests that, in future, people who want to email her might have to \"pay\" a dollar, refundable if she accepts their mail (or perhaps not, if it's their first time contacting her). \"I think there will be lots of systems, and they'll all work differently.\" The economics of dealing with that would put off spammers, she suggests. \"I agree that pretty soon sending most email will cost money, but I think that's only right,\" she said in her March article. \"It costs money to guarantee quality and safety. Moreover, I think the market will work, and that it will not shut out deserving senders.\" Only one problem with that: a \"sender- pays\" free-for-all would actually benefit spammers and seriously inconvenience everyone else, according to research by Dr Richard Clayton, of the security group in the computer laboratory at Cambridge University. In a 2004 study, he noted a number of reasons why \"sender pays\" would fail: labour is cheap in Asia (where spammers could hire people to click on links or get computers to solve puzzles); middlemen would push up their price; and spammers offering profitable items (such as pharmaceuticals, real or fake) could afford to pay per-email prices that ordinary users wouldn't - so your inbox would see proportionally more spam. Plus, Clayton adds, \"for a consumer at home with some bit of malware on their machine stealing their resources, you'd get a bill for hundreds of pounds for the millions of spam emails it had sent out\". But he thinks that Goodmail is not as bad as has been suggested; that it is a legitimate way for airlines or banks to reach customers, when messages might otherwise be blocked. O'Brien disagrees, seeing it as the slippery slope towards a two-tier - or multi-tier - internet. The EFF argues (at dearaol.com) that those organisations that do not pay the \"email tax\" would increasingly be left behind with unreliable service. \"Your customers expect that your first obligation is to deliver all of their wanted mail, and this plan is a step away from that obligation.\" O'Brien adds that widespread \"sender-pays\" systems would be a disaster. \"What would you lose to do this? Basically, nearly all of the advantages email has over existing post. Mass mail in the postal system is mainly transactional mail (bills), advertising with a clear monetary return, and occasionally charities begging for money. Compare that with the richness of email conversations: long threads and discussions, updates from groups appealing from 20 to 20 million with no ask, and no money expected; shared knowledge about a hundred and one topics. \"Pay-to-send would be a way of filtering your incoming mail against spam. Like any suggestion for filtering, we should judge it on the false positives it falsely rejects. In this case, that's a vast chunk of the conversations and interchanges from across the world that makes mail what it is. It sounds an easy solution, but the collateral damage would be incomparably worse than even today's filters.\" \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
