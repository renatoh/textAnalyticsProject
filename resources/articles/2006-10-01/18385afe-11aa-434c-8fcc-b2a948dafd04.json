The Heineken pot has been bubbling to overflowing this week even before those timely assaults on the manhood of English rugby by Ronan O'Gara and Justin Marshall. So, at the risk of inflaming passions further, I'll throw another incendiary suggestion. French club rugby is pretty poor at the moment. It's wobbling. Not on its knees, but definitely not focused. The bad news is that it won't stay that way for long, so now is the time for English, Welsh, Irish and even Scottish clubs to land telling blows. Even allowing that Munster are the holders and Wasps won the cup in 2004, France has been the dominant country for the past four seasons with Toulouse consistently the strongest side. But take a peep across the Channel and some strange things have been happening. Clermont Auverge are the side everyone is talking about and they haven't qualified for the Heineken in four years. OK, Stade Fran\u00e7ais are top of the domestic league, but thanks to the marshalling arts of their new fly-half Brock James, Clermont sit above Toulouse, who they drubbed 46-9 a fortnight ago, and Biarritz. Perpignan had a dismal run of three defeats before beating Agen who, like Bourgoin, are midtable, that no man's land in the Top 14 Championnat where a coach's thoughts turn to domestic survival ahead of Europe. And Castres are in deeper trouble, three off the bottom, so Wasps are likely to see a depleted side at Wycombe on Sunday. What does this mean? No French side is ever a pushover, but the early rounds could see them vulnerable. Northampton still have a mountain to climb at Biarritz on Sunday, but Cardiff must fancy their chances at Bourgoin. Likewise Ulster, who host Toulouse at Ravenhill, still minus Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Michalak. Then next week London Irish travel in hope to Toulouse, the Ospreys to Paris and Wasps to Perpignan for what, even so early in the competition, is the key game in Pool One. Perpignan have only ever lost two Heineken games at home: to Wasps in their glory year of 2004 and to Leicester in 2002 when they also won the cup. Do I sense a tingle that history is repeating itself? Wasps have recruited well - pairing Tom Palmer with Simon Shaw has added power to the second row and having Phil Vickery at tight-head prop helps when it comes to big scrummagers such as the French sides - and are starting to play with the intensity and speed that should help them top the group and go much further. In Pool Two I'll take a long-odds punt on Gloucester, even though much depends on how their young midfielders come away from Dublin. Do well this weekend against the O'Driscoll-D'Arcy axis and a Leinster side that outplayed Toulouse at home last year, and they will have taken a big step towards playing international rugby. Stade Fran\u00e7ais, with 10 domestic wins from 11, buck my French theory, but they are suffering. Shaun Sowerby's broken ankle in the win over Biarritz at Stade de France on Saturday leaves them without a recognised flanker, and Pool Three will depend on how much Sale learned in Europe last season. It could be tight, but, with an Italian team in their group, Sale should go forward. Tonight at Swansea is doubly important. I like what the Ospreys are doing and there is no doubt that the Celtic League is much stronger, but they have to beat Sale to prove they are growing as a team. Defeat would also force Marshall to eat his words. Likewise O'Gara at Leicester on Sunday - particularly the bit about being the best fly-half in Europe. Not clever. However, his Munster should top Pool Four over Leicester and a resurgent Cardiff. Leicester, pretty dodgy away from home, have to face the holders in Limerick in the last pool round. And we all know what has happened to every Heineken side visiting Thomond Park. Ravenhill is the other Irish fortress and Ulster have used it well. But by that same weekend in January, Guy Noves will have cranked up Toulouse in Pool Five, their three defeats so far in the Top 14 a distant memory. The same with Biarritz. They may be playing some poor stuff at the moment but Pool Six is the weakest and I can't see the Borders or Parma standing in their way. However, this weekend would be a good time for Northampton to land a sucker punch. Melville's picks for the pools and semis Pool One Castres, Perpignan, Treviso, Wasps Prediction Wasps The London side are near their intimidating best. After two years of failing to get beyond the group stages, a summer recruiting programme has given them good depth in the squad and a beefed-up pack. Tom Palmer and Phil Vickery obviously catch the eye among the recruits and there are mouth-watering resources in the back row as well: Johnny O'Connor will soon be fit and the 22-year-old Tom Rees and the even younger James Haskell are already vying for the No7 shirt. Joe Worsley cannot get off the bench. Pool Two Agen, Edinburgh, Gloucester, Leinster Prediction Gloucester Leinster will be the bookies' group favourites and Edinburgh are going well in the Celtic League but Gloucester's young backs are flying and could upset the applecart in Dublin this weekend. If that happens it will blow the group wide open. Pool Three Calvisano, Ospreys, Sale, Stade Fran\u00e7ais Prediction Stade Fran\u00e7ais Sale and Ospreys both have the ability to wound Stade and with Calvisano in the group both will have hopes of progressing. Sale will also have learned from reaching the quarter-finals last year and have continued to build their squad. However, when it comes to depth of talent few can match the millionaires of Paris. Pool Four Bourgoin, Cardiff, Leicester, Munster Prediction Munster Winning last season after so many near misses has made Munster even stronger and, although Cardiff and Leicester might not fear them when they are this side of the Irish Sea, the fact is that no one has ever beaten them in the Heineken Cup in Limerick. Pool Five Llanelli, London Irish, Toulouse, Ulster Prediction Toulouse The French team are possibly not quite so commanding these days - remember, they were outplayed by Leinster in Toulouse last season - but they are another of France's rich kids with plenty of talent to burn and a history that has seen them in four of the 11 previous finals. Pool Six Biarritz, Border Reivers, Northampton, Parma Prediction Biarritz Capable of playing some dull rugby, but the last of France's Big Three should be more than capable of topping the weakest group in the competition. Northampton have a chance of squeezing through with big wins against Borders and Parma. Four for the semi-finals Wasps, Biarritz, Toulouse and Gloucester"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
