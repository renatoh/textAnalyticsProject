The cover immediately sparked passionate conversations around masculinity and gendered dressing: Styles dons a voluminous periwinkle blue gown paired with a black tuxedo jacket (both designed by Gucci). The image felt representative of a growing exploration of gender-fluidity and non-binary dressing taking place, popular among the very millennial and Gen-Z shoppers Vogue is targeted towards. However, prominent conservatives \u2013 from Candace Owens to Ben Shapiro \u2013 voiced disapproval of Styles wearing dresses. Owens wrote on her Twitter page Friday evening: \u201cBring back manly men.\u201d \u201cThere is no society that can survive without strong men,\u201d Owens, a rightwing media powerhouse, said. \u201cThe East knows this. In the west, the steady feminization of our men at the same time that Marxism is being taught to our children is not a coincidence. It is an outright attack.\u201d Shapiro, a conservative pundit, appeared to agree with Owens\u2019 attacks. He shared her tweet and added: \u201cAnyone who pretends this is not a referendum on masculinity for men to don floofy dresses is treating you like a full-on idiot.\u201d These comments fit in with how contested and divisive debates around gender expression have become in the US, even when a massively popular musician such as Styles, who identifies as cisgender, engages in progressive developments. This is not the first time Styles has played around with fashion in bold ways. The singer wore a black dress by the Japanese brand Commes Des Gar\u00e7ons on the cover of the Guardian Weekend and defended the queer aesthetics of his visual work. \u201cI\u2019m not just sprinkling in sexual ambiguity to be interesting,\u201d he said. \u201cI want things to look a certain way. Not because it makes me look gay, or it makes me look straight, or it makes me look bisexual, but because I think it looks cool.\u201d Fellow Hollywood stars were quick to come to Styles\u2019 defense. Olivia Wilde, who is currently directing a Styles-led film, replied to Owens\u2019 tweets with: \u201cYou\u2019re pathetic.\u201d And The Good Place actress Jameela Jamil tweeted out in Styles\u2019 defense: \u201cManly is whatever you want it to be.\u201d Meanwhile, others have argued Styles cover may not be enough for increasing acceptance towards non-binary expression and identities. \u201cHarry Styles\u2019 Vogue cover may be historic, but it isn\u2019t radical,\u201d the Daily Beast declared in a headline. If this is the furor a white, cis man wearing a dress on Vogue breeds, it is hard to imagine what a model from a marginalized background \u2013 say, a trans woman of color (which Vogue has yet to feature on its cover) \u2013 would face."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
