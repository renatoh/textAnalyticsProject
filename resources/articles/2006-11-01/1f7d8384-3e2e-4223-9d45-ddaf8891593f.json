However, after a BT \"repair\" that eventually fixed our line following a storm, we found ourselves without a broadband service and, after getting BT to identify the problem, blacklisted from an ADSL service. Cable is not an option here, 3G too expensive and dial-up is too slow, but we found an ISP that provided a one-way satellite service (AVC broadband). After signing up (\u00a3130 set-up fee plus \u00a330 a month subscription) we received a letter from AVC informing me that it will be ceasing its one-way satellite service from January 2007. So we are now having to once again search through a list of unknown suppliers of satellite based services which may/may not go bust at any time. Each one seems to use slightly different equipment and so requires yet another expensive purchase. There must be tens of thousands of people just like us having the same problems. Does anyone know of a reliable and reasonably priced provider of satellite based broadband (one-way and two-way)? Mike Thompson Jack Schofield replies: AVC users have the option to move to a Mediasat.ie service for home broadband (www.mediasat.ie/homebb.htm) but \"that's up to them,\" says an AVC salesman. An alternative would be to go for a BT or BTapproved service (BT also sells its satellite service wholesale), but these are generally aimed at business users and not particularly cheap for home users. For example, Broadband Wherever.net starts at \u00a360 per month. However, skyDSL (www.telesskydsl.com) might be an option. Since the withdrawal of BT's ISDN Home Highway service last year, users who are beyond the range of ADSL don't have much choice. We're interested in hearing from readers who are using skyDSL or another satellite broadband connection. AVG, still free I've been happy with AVG's free edition 7.1, but have been told that it will cease to be supported in January next year. Can you please suggest an alternative? Les Dixon JS: I suggest you switch to the new AVG 7.5, which is also free. Go to free.grisoft.com/ or, more specifically, tinyurl.com/lzu8z. Getting Xdrive From your recent item, Xdrive sounds just the ticket for backing up my data. But AOL seems to require a zip code (and not a postcode) in order to set up a screen name, and hence an account. Any idea how to get round this? Richard Rusbridger, James Gordon, Laurence Errington and others JS: You can sign up for Xdrive if you have an AOL screen name, and you can get one of those by signing up for a service at www.aol.co.uk. Otherwise use one of your fake US identities. American university websites are a good source of generic phone numbers and zip codes that are likely to be used by large numbers of students. Overheating routers I used to turn off my old broadband router overnight as it ran very hot and I live in a timber-framed house! It used to reconnect instantly, but in the past few months took up to an hour, so I began leaving it on permanently until it gave up the ghost. My new wireless router doesn't even have an on/off switch. Should I turn it off? Richard Byatt JS: Some cheap routers have small, badly designed cases and do tend to overheat, which can cause connection problems and means they tend not to last. After one died in my rug, I've taken to mounting them higher up, on legs or at least raised using Blu-Tack to improve air circulation. Certainly don't stand any router on something hot, and don't cover it with papers or whatever. Some do-it-yourselfers have been known to bore holes in the cases and install small fans. However, routers also tend to work better if left on all the time, so that's what I do and normally recommend. Just unplug it if going on holiday. An ADSL router should reconnect in a minute or two, at most. If there's a problem, the flashing lights should help you figure out what it is. Ghostly backup Having spent a lot of time getting a new PC set up as I want it with Windows XP Home, I'd like to take a snapshot of the system to an external drive, so I can recover to that point if I ever need a new disk, or have to reformat the old one. Can Windows System Restore be persuaded to do that? I don't really want a full disk image like Ghost generates. Clive Perkins JS: Sorry, System Restore does not do the job, and a Ghost-type disk image is what you need. Acronis True Image seems to be the software of choice at the moment, but there are half a dozen alternatives including Terabyte Unlimited's Image for Windows (www.bootitng.com/imagew.html), and Easeus (www.easeus.com/disk-copy), which is free. Backchat \u00b7 I suggested that Clare Nesbitt look at iSkoot for a Skype connection for her Treo. Dave Beck says: \"I have and use this successfully in the UK on my Treo 650. It has the signifi cant advantage over the two VoIP implementations you mentioned, Articulation and MobiVoIP, in that it only uses the data path (GPRS) to setup the destination of the call and uses normal 'local minutes' to carry the voice, no matter where the destination. Clare should ignore that the UK in not listed in the supported countries: my calls route via an 0208 number, automatically set when you configure the application. She can also look at Mino and Jajah.\" \u00b7Lewis Graham, Ken Baxter and others wrote in to say they were happy with their Shuttle PCs. Ken Baxter says: \"It has made a major diff erence in the space available in my small study and doesn't need to sit on the floor sucking in dust.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
