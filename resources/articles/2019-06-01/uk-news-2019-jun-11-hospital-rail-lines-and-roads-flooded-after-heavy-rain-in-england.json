The Environment Agency issued dozens of flood alerts across England and a flood warning, which is more serious, for Wokingham, Berkshire. One of the worst-hit areas was Lincolnshire, where floodwater had to be pumped out of Pilgrim hospital in Boston. There were so many emergency in calls in the county that fire crews said they could only deal with flooding incidents if water had entered people\u2019s homes. In the south-east, railway lines near Orpington in Kent and Mitcham Junction in London were flooded as the network struggled to cope with a month\u2019s worth of rain in 24 hours. Rain also damaged power supply to trains and signalling equipment, Network Rail said. The rail operator Southern warned passengers to expect delays and cancellations for the rest of the day across the Southern and Thameslink network and urged people avoid travelling in the south London area if possible. Flash floods forced the closure of dozens of roads, including in Wymondham in Norfolk and Bromsgrove in Worcestershire. Overnight the M25 was closed for several hours in both directions after a sinkhole opened up on the carriageway near Sevenoaks in Kent. After emergency repairs the road was fully reopened in time for the morning rush-hour. In West Kingsdown, near Sevenoaks, a woman in her 80s and her dog were rescued after her home was flooded to waist height. The Met Office has extended a yellow \u201cbe prepared\u201d warning for heavy rain from Tuesday to Thursday. It now stretches from parts of north Wales in the west to the Wash in the east and all the way to Edinburgh in the north. Another warning covers Devon and Somerset, where similar conditions were expected. Forecasters predict that some areas of the UK could be inundated with up to 100mm of rain this week, twice the monthly average for June. On Wednesday and Thursday, some parts of the UK could get between 60mm and 100mm of rain, the Met Office said. Advice was issued to avoid low-lying footpaths near watercourses and to plan driving routes to avoid low-lying roads near rivers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
