Reporter Sean Nicholls and crew began filming on Sydney\u2019s northern beaches at the end of March, documenting the struggle between incumbent Tony Abbott and independent Zali Steggall. They have filmed behind the scenes with both candidates, but the former prime minister has so far refused a sit-down interview. On Wednesday Nicholls was surprised to read in the Australian that Four Corners was \u201cembedded\u201d with the Steggall team. The claim came from the former ABC chairmain Maurice Newman, who has a weekly column in which he variously bashes the ABC for being a \u201ccampaigner for radical environmentalism and globalism\u201d and spruiks his peculiar brand of climate denialism. \u201cFor some time now, the ABC\u2019s Four Corners has embedded a journalist within independent environmentalist Zali Steggall\u2019s campaign team,\u201d Newman wrote. \u201cSteggall is looking to topple the incumbent member for Warringah, former prime minister Tony Abbott, who, for almost 25 years, has held the once safe Liberal seat. The national broadcaster is risking time and money to capture that surreal moment when Abbott may be out of the parliament.\u201d Nicholls called Newman and politely told him he was wrong, eliciting an immediate apology from the arch conservative. Four Corners executive producer Sally Neighbour corrected the record on Twitter, saying Nicholls was not \u201cembedded\u201d with Steggall and the program had filmed with both candidates. Despite the Newman apology, the Australian has not corrected the article. Hunt in full cry The language in Newman\u2019s piece was echoed by Andrew Bolt the next day in a column which claimed Abbott felt \u201chunted\u201d. Bolt warned the country would change dramatically if Abbott lost his seat. \u201cGlobal warming will become our dominant religion, the power of militant activists will soar, Liberal conservatives will be cowed and, given the swing needed, the Liberals will have lost the election,\u201d Bolt wrote. Abbott has relied on media mates like Newman and Bolt to campaign for him while largely shunning the mainstream media. He has declined interview requests and scuttled away from community appearances when the media turn up. Picking up Newman\u2019s theme, Bolt accused Sydney Morning Herald and ABC journalists of \u201copenly barracking\u201d for Steggall. \u201cThe ABC\u2019s hatred of Abbott \u2013 who as prime minister cut its budget and axed the carbon tax \u2013 is overwhelming,\u201d he said, using the same term \u201cembedded\u201d about another ABC journalist. \u201cNow the ABC\u2019s Four Corners is spending a lot of time on the Steggall campaign for a documentary on, obviously, how she beat Abbott. The ABC seems heavily invested in a Steggall win.\u201d Bolt clearly can\u2019t see the irony in his final line, published in the News Corp tabloids which have campaigned so hard against Labor: \u201cI have never seen activist groups and the media run such a ferocious campaign to destroy a Liberal candidate.\u201d Joyce loses bearings Not to be outdone on getting facts wrong, Barnaby Joyce also attacked the ABC this week over what he thought was the broadcaster\u2019s popular Vote Compass site. Except, it wasn\u2019t Vote Compass at all, but an item on The Drum, a fact he later grudgingly acknowledged after it was pointed out to him. Lego Masters of the Nine universe Journalists on the Sydney Morning Herald were a little startled to see not one but two of their new overlords on the newsroom floor on Friday. Nine Entertainment\u2019s chief executive, Hugh Marks, and chairman, former Liberal treasurer Peter Costello, walked around and chatted to journalists after a board meeting of the newly formed media giant at the Herald\u2019s offices in Pyrmont. Marks may have been a more popular figure among scribes after announcing subediting was coming back in-house. Newspapers aside, Marks is rubbing his hands with glee over Nine\u2019s new hit TV show Lego Masters, which attracted 2.15m viewers to its finale this week. Audiences over one million are rare these days, never mind two million. Star fades out The Star Observer, Australia\u2019s longest running LGBTI media outlet has entered voluntary administration, the board has announced. Chairman Sebastian Rice said advertising clients had been slow to pay their bills resulting in a cash flow problem. \u201cWe needed to enter voluntary administration to protect our creditors and staff, and provide a chance for the Star Observer to survive,\u201d Rice said. Unease at News Corp The Australian took a low key approach to accusations of bias last week by former News Corp journalist Tony Koch. The only mention of the explosive Koch column was by associate editor and Sky News commentator Chris Kenny. Kenny, who has quit Twitter (again) in a fit of pique, referred in passing to an \u201canti-News Corp rant last week by an award-winning former journalist on this newspaper, Tony Koch\u201d. But two other columnists for the Australian did share their views on the way the Oz has been covering the election campaign, albeit not in one of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s publications. Columnist and former Liberal adviser Niki Savva told ABC Radio\u2019s the World Today there was no doubt \u201cthere are grounds for concern about the way that some of the coverage has been handled\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not welcome, I don\u2019t think, certainly by a lot of journalists who pride themselves on their work,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there has been, you know, a decision taken, at whatever level, and I do not believe in edicts being issued from the very top. \u201cI think these are decisions that are made by the people who are running the newspaper, and they don\u2019t always make the right calls. Just like politicians, they make mistakes. And I think some very obvious mistakes have been made, and I think that\u2019s a great shame.\u201d The Australian\u2019s contributing editor Peter van Onselen said in his The Professor and the Hack podcast with Hugh Riminton that the Australian has been \u201cconsiderably harder on Labor\u201d in this election campaign. But PVO reserved his disdain for tabloids, in particular the Daily Telegraph\u2019s front page on Bill Shorten\u2019s mother. \u201cI understand Labor\u2019s frustration \u2026 because if you\u2019re a Labor politician you\u2019d feel like they were coming at you pretty hard \u2013 because they are.\u201d PVO said he was surprised that every News Corp Sunday newspaper editorialised that Scott Morrison should be re-elected. But the Daily Telegraph\u2019s political editor, Sharri Markson, had a different take, posting a photograph of herself accepting a News Corp award from Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch on Twitter and Instagram. \u201cI\u2019m proud to work for a company deeply passionate about journalism,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI\u2019m sick of rival outlets, who should be committed to free speech, trying to tear us down. The world is a better place for the journalism the thousands of people who work for News produce.\u201d The Australian is offering its subscribers tickets to an \u201cunmissable subscribers-only Q&amp;A event\u201d after the election with \u201csome of the country\u2019s sharpest political minds\u201d including editor-in-chief Christopher Dore, Van Onselen, Geoff Chambers, Kenny and former BuzzFeed reporter Alice Workman. It should be a barrel of laughs if Labor wins on Saturday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
