The Scotland coach, Andy Robinson, has opted for the attack-minded Ruaridh Jackson at fly-half, rather than the more conservative Dan Parks, and he has chosen his most potent three-quarter line, with Max Evans and Simon Danielli flanking the centres Joe Ansbro and Sean Lamont. Robinson has made seven changes, one positional, from the side that lost to Argentina last Saturday. Kelly Brown and Jim Hamilton were ruled out by injury, the latter's absence allowing the return of the captain, Alastair Kellock, who was not selected against the Pumas. Euan Murray, who was not available last Sunday on religious grounds, returns at tighthead prop and Robinson has opted for Mike Blair at scrum-half, ahead of Rory Lawson and Chris Cusiter, on the basis that he will add to Scotland's attacking threat. Chris Paterson will make his 15th World Cup appearance, a Scottish record. \"We have to go for it,\" said Robinson, who was part of England's management team when they won the World Cup in 2003. \"We have played three games in challenging conditions while England have been indoors but we have always tried to move the ball and play rugby. \"We have not got our execution right in the final third and we have to keep the scoreboard moving and play what is in front of us. This is not about knocking England out of the tournament but about Scotland making the quarter-finals.\" Scotland, whose side includes four Aviva Premiership players, need to win and deny England a bonus point to make the last eight. While they have failed to score a try in their past two matches, both played in the rain, England have yet to concede a try when they have had 15 players on the field. \"We know the challenge we face and the players are really excited by it,\" said Robinson. \"There is a great buzz about the place and the focus is on winning the match, not getting ahead of ourselves. It is important that we find wide spaces to attack in and that is why we have picked a side based on speed.\" The back\u2011line, with the exception of Blair, is the one Scotland took to Twickenham last March, a day they matched England on tries and caused the eventual Six Nations some grief before losing 22-16. Robinson added: \"We have moved Seam Lamont from the centre to the wing because he did well there in the Six Nations and he is a strong runner with the ball. The more he carries, the better for us. \"There is always a lot of emotion when Scotland play England. My first match as a player against them was a 12-12 all and my first game as a coach against them was a 15-15 draw. They were both chaotic and that is why I want us to play really quickly.\" Scotland Paterson; Evans, Ansbro, S Lamont, Danielli; Jackson, Blair; Jacobsen, Ford, Murray, Gray, Kellock (capt), Strokosch, Barclay, Vernon. Replacements S Lawson, Dickinson, Hines, Rennie, Cusiter, Parks, De Luca."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
