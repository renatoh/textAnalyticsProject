What a Carve Up! shares a title and narrative framework with a 1961 British film comedy. That book\u2019s 2015 sequel, Number 11, more tangentially draws on horror flicks; Expo 58 has a subplot modelled on Hitchcock\u2019s The Lady Vanishes; while Coe described The Terrible Privacy of Maxwell Sim as his attempt at a literary road movie. Coe\u2019s latest novel, however, is his most passionate marriage of screen and page. In 1977, Calista Frangopolou, a young Athenian woman, is backpacking across California with Gill Foley, a Brummie teenager she befriended at a Greyhound station. Gill is invited to dinner in Los Angeles with an old business contact of her dad\u2019s, who turns out to be Billy Wilder, septuagenarian Austrian \u00e9migr\u00e9 director of films including Some Like It Hot and Sunset Boulevard. Through contrived but amusing plotting, the ingenue from Greece is hired to provide local know-how during the shooting in Corfu of Fedora, the 1978 late-career movie by Wilder and co-writer IAL Diamond, another dinner guest. As always, Coe buries cross-references to earlier works by himself (the Foley clan have been recurring characters) and others, not impeding the progress or pleasure of readers who miss them, but adding another level for those in the know. Among Wilder\u2019s movies was The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes; he jokes to Calista about the Holmes story \u201cThe Adventure of the Greek Interpreter\u201d, with which Coe also has other fun. There are allusions to Wilder\u2019s films The Apartment and Ace in the Hole, and, as both Sunset Boulevard and Fedora feature forgotten cinematic superstars, the novel is affectingly underscored by the apprehension of Wilder and Diamond that a new type of Hollywood represented by \u201cthat shark film\u201d (Steven Spielberg\u2019s Jaws) may mean the end for them in the way that the talkies finished the protagonist of Sunset Boulevard. While shooting Fedora, Wilder\u2019s desire to move from comedies to more serious drama causes tension with Diamond, who wanted to keep up the gag count. Coe is well placed to animate both sides of this debate, as his novels have been an exploration of the limits of comedy. In a 2013 Guardian essay, he described the greater difficulty of writing in the English comic tradition of Evelyn Waugh, Kingsley Amis, David Lodge and Michael Frayn (his initial literary models) in a world of increasing political complexity and sensitivities over the inherent cruelty of humour. Coe\u2019s to-and-fro over jokes continues in Mr Wilder &amp; Me. It may seem strange that a short novel spends five pages on a narratively redundant encounter between the adult Gill (whose later family life interleaves the 1970s action) and a producer who has spent a quarter of a century trying to finance a movie based on a Kingsley Amis novel. But that impossible project can be seen to represent the broader, more farcical side of Coe\u2019s work, as found in What a Carve Up! and The Rotters\u2019 Club in opposition to the straighter strain of The Rain Before It Falls and The Terrible Privacy of Maxwell Sim. Coe\u2019s previous novel, the anti-Brexit Middle England, which won both the Costa novel of the year prize and the Prix du livre europ\u00e9en in France, occupied a mezzanine between laughter and darker tones, which the new novel also walks. There\u2019s a neat running gag involving Calista\u2019s cinematic knowledge being crammed from reference books, and a fine comedic set-piece in which she translates earnest interview questions to Wilder. A darker mood intrudes with the Nazi ghosts of Wilder\u2019s homeland. The presentation of that material in the form of a 50-page fantasy screenplay makes this generally light and simple novel the most formally experimental of Coe\u2019s later books. Stylistically, though, the prose is unusually relaxed about word repetitions. It also feels unlikely that, as a young single woman on a 70s movie set, Calista suffers no unwanted sexual attention. Coe may have been restricted here by using largely real-life characters, whose vivid plausibility is a great achievement. Wilder, charismatically wise-cracking but haunted by history, and Diamond, agonised by the lengthy complexity of turning words into pictures, give the book the feel of a real movie memoir. Although set mainly in Greece, Los Angeles and Paris, the novel also obliquely extends Coe\u2019s long commentary on Englishness. Diamond, after a long residency while shooting the Sherlock Holmes film, has concluded: \u201cI know that technically England is part of Europe, but \u2026 England is its own thing, you know?\u201d Calista agrees that, visiting London, her Greek family had a sense of \u201cvisiting not just a different country but a different continent\u201d. But such national analysis has second billing in this fiction to Coe\u2019s other career-long obsession, cinema. An afterword acknowledges that many of Wilder\u2019s best lines in the book are taken verbatim from interviews and biographies; impressively, a final footnote reveals that a startling detail of Wilder\u2019s response to Spielberg\u2019s Schindler\u2019s List was discovered by Coe during his research interview with the director Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff. As cineastes say, it\u2019s always worth reading to the end of the credits. \u2022 Mr Wilder &amp; Me is published by Viking (\u00a316.99). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com.
