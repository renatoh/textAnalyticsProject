Aimed at readers over 11, Runemarks is a fantasy based on Norse legends and is said to have leading roles for gods, goblins and demons. Harris has been signed by Random House Children's Books, whose managing director, Phillippa Dickinson, described her as \"a fantastic storyteller\". Meanwhile, Harris reports on her website that she is at work on a new novel. \"The Lollipop Shoes is the name of the book (or at least it is until the marketing people force me to change it), and I'm about 50 pages into it, which isn't far enough for me to know where it's going, or to feel entirely comfortable with the plot just yet.\" The Liverpool Culture Company has appointed Jason Harborow to be its chief executive from the beginning of next month. Harborow, who now becomes the figurehead as Liverpool's year as European capital of culture draws near, was formerly the company's chief operating officer. He was appointed interim chief executive this month after the resignation of Sir David Henshaw, but has now been confirmed in the top job, which carries a salary of \u00a3150,000. Harborow was formerly commercial general manager for the Commonwealth Games in Manchester in 2002. On bad days of Pennine rain, there appears to be as much water above ground in the Derbyshire spa town of Buxton as there is in the limestone rocks below. But when the sun shines in high summer, it is an ideal venue for a festival based around Frank Matcham's Opera House. Audiences have trebled over the last six years, with eight operas (including Monteverdi's Poppea and Shostakovich's The Nose) programmed this year, plus concerts and a series of literary events, some hosted by Roy Hattersley , the festival's chairman. This will be the last Peak District summer for Aidan Lang, artistic director for seven years: he is to join the NBR New Zealand Opera as general director. Michael Douglas is beginning to look like the magician hero of Shakespeare's Tempest so it is appropriate he has been given an award called a Prospero at the ninth Bermuda international film festival. A local newspaper describes Douglas as \"arguably Bermuda's most famous resident\": he and his wife, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and their two children have a home on the islands. david.ward@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
