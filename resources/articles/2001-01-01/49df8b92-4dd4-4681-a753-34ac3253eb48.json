He said the NHS inspectorate, the commission for health improvement (CHI) will examine the trust's management systems during a visit to the trust in a fortnight's time. In a damning emergency statement on the incident in the Commons, Mr Milburn condemned it as \"totally and utterly unacceptable\". He said: \"This was not a cash problem in the hospital. It was not a capacity problem in the hospital. It was a management problem in the hospital.\" Mr Milburn disclosed that he had been advised that an additional purpose-built mortuary facility was \"at no stage full\" while bodies were stored in the chapel. \"There were no policies or procedures in place in the hospital to ensure that the bodies of deceased patients were treated with respect and dignity at all times,\" he said. \"The events in Bedford last week should never have happened. They need never have happened. I am deeply sorry they did.\" In his statement, Mr Milburn said preliminary inquires had shown that in the past, bodies had been kept in the chapel of rest when the mortuary was full. He said the government's guidance on treating the dead with dignity and respect had not been \"adequately implemented\" and welcomed the decision of Mr Williams to step down. \"In the circumstances that was the right thing to do.\" An initial verbal report on the incident had been made to NHS chief executive Nigel Crisp and a full report would be published later. Mr Milburn said that in the past there were no clear guidelines about ensuring dignity and respect for deceased patients. Guidance had been issued in May last year and repeated again in November. \"In Bedford that guidance was not adequately implemented.\" He said: \"The preliminary inquiries appear to show that in the past when the mortuary facility was full the deceased were kept in the chapel of rest. \"Following the issue of guidance in May, an extra purpose-built mortuary facility was purchased. \"I am advised that the additional facility was at no stage full. It was functioning normally apart from a minor problem with the doors. \"The problem was reported on Monday of last week but final action was not taken until Thursday. During that period last week bodies were placed inappropriately in the chapel of rest.\" Hospital management had failed to implement the clear national guidance and failed to resolve immediately this local problem. \"The issue should and could have been sorted out on the spot. Instead deceased patients were denied their dignity. That should never happen in any part of the NHS.\" Mr Milburn denied that what had happened at Bedford was a reflection of what was happening across the country. The Health and Safety Executive will visit Bedford hospital on Thursday and CHI will begin an independent inspection on January 29. \"The inspection will now cover this matter as part of its wider inspection of the hospital,\" he said. Shadow health secretary Dr Liam Fox described the Bedford chief executive as a \"scapegoat\" and asked Mr Milburn if it was true that the same practice had been followed in the hospital for many years. Consultants had raised the issue of a shortage of pathology facilities, but it was not until photographs appeared in newspapers that any action was taken. \"Is it true that the chairman was also asked to resign but declined to do so?\" demanded Dr Fox. \"The government forces the managers to spend money on political initiatives, such as the waiting list initiative, rather than improving pathology services,\" raged Dr Fox. He turned to Mr Milburn: \"We see pathology as a priority, but you would rather it was spent on treating non-urgent cases within 18 months. Dr Fox continued \"The NHS is being used to deliver ministerial targets, rather than dealing with the clinical priorities of doctors and their patients.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
