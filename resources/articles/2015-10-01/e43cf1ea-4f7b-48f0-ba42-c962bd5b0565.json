For it is while walking his beloved dog around the park with friends and family that England\u2019s captain Chris Robshaw has attempted to make sense of all that has already slipped by in this World Cup and what could still transpire. \u201cI\u2019m sure for everyone in this room you do something different to relax, don\u2019t you,\u201d said Robshaw of his stress-relieving tactics. \u201cRichie McCaw flies gliders, Tom Wood likes shooting his bow and arrow, Tom Youngs likes to go farming. Everyone has got something. It doesn\u2019t have to be something extravagant and whatever it is, use it.\u201d During those solitary moments, Robshaw has also sought to disperse whatever demons linger from that fateful decision not to kick for goal in the dying embers of last Saturday\u2019s clash with Wales and clear his mind for the do-or-die battle with Australia to come. \u201cIt is on your mind a lot but that is when you use the experience from the past about what has worked well. It is just trying to not play the game in your mind too early,\u201d says Robshaw, who will lead his team out for the 41st time at Twickenham on Saturday. \u201cOf course you need to fuel the fire but I think everyone is pretty chilled at the moment and preparing nicely. We are building and building, and come Saturday we will be ready.\u201d From players to management and support staff, the entire England camp is trying \u2013 and largely failing \u2013 to convey the impression that it is business as usual. Both the coach, Stuart Lancaster, and Robshaw harked back to the way the side bounced back from defeat against South Africa in 2012 to overcome the All Blacks. But the stakes here are so much higher. As well as his decision making and leadership abilities, there is also intense focus on Robshaw\u2019s ability. Japan\u2019s coach, Eddie Jones \u2013 not, it has to be said, an altogether impartial observer \u2013 damned Robshaw with exceedingly faint praise this week. The former Australia coach said Robshaw was \u201can outstanding club player but at international level he just doesn\u2019t have that point of difference\u201d, a \u201cgood workmanlike player\u201d who is \u201cnot outstandingly good in any area\u201d. All of which criticism the Harlequins flanker vows will act as fuel in the most important match of his career. \u201cAs an international captain I\u2019ve learnt in the past you take the rough with the smooth. There\u2019s good times, there\u2019s bad times and you need to learn how to deal with it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to know what\u2019s happening, absorb it and use it, I think. That\u2019s the best way. You want to go out and prove a couple of people wrong.\u201d Along with Jones, he might add Will Carling, Sir Clive Woodward and a few others to that list. The RFU\u2019s \u201cmind mechanic\u201d Bill Beswick has been at Pennyhill Park this week to help individual players. Lancaster, who pinned his colours to Robshaw early on in his tenure, unsurprisingly backed his captain to emerge stronger for the experience and underlined the responsibility of the collective. \u201cIt\u2019s been tough for him but he is a tough guy. He is resilient and he\u2019ll be fine for Saturday.\u201d Ultimately, Robshaw is banking on a similar mental toughness throughout the squad to pull England back from the brink of the potential disaster of exiting their own party before the pool stages are even complete. \u201cThis is when teams come together I think, when you see actually how close you are as a squad because it is easy for a squad to splinter and as a squad we have come even closer together, understood each other a little better and we\u2019ve been there for each other,\u201d he said. \u201cThe guys have taken a tough time but that is international sport, isn\u2019t it? It is about what you do next and what you do from this moment now.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
