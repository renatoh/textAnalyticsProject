The Australian Christian Lobby, which set up the Folau fundraiser on its website, called the flow of donations overwhelming. \u201cWe have decided we should stop at $2m and raise more money if and when we need it,\u201d the ACL head, Martyn Iles, told the Australian on Thursday. \u201cThe sheer scale and pace of the response from donors has just been overwhelming.\u201d The ACL appears to be seeking to cash in on publicity generated by the Folau case, asking supporters to chip in for a separate religious freedom fighting fund to raise $1.6m by the end of the financial year. The outpouring of money for Folau\u2019s legal battle comes as the former Wallaby, RA and their lawyers prepare for a conciliation hearing on Friday with the Fair Work Commission. An RMIT University law school professor, Anthony Forsyth, said it was unusual for lawyers to be involved at this point. \u201cNormally people are self-represented at the conciliation stage,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. Forsyth said the presence of lawyers could mean two things \u2013 either the desire of both parties to settle or an indication that Folau wanted to \u201cgo in all guns blazing, to show how serious he is\u201d. He expects the conciliation hearing to be held in person rather than by phone hook-up. The Rugby World Cup kicks off in Japan in September and runs until November. Forsyth doesn\u2019t think the Folau legal saga will be concluded by then, particularly if it progresses to the federal court. \u201cIt\u2019s a fairly typical pattern that parties don\u2019t settle at these conciliation hearings but the closer you get to the actual [court] date \u2026 that\u2019s when you start to see people focusing a lot more on settlement and it\u2019s quite common to settle even up to the day or the morning of the hearing,\u201d he said. Folau wanted to raise $3m to fund his unfair dismissal claim, saying the termination of his contract amounts to discrimination on religious grounds. But employment lawyers have raised eyebrows at that figure, saying if he were hiring the most expensive legal team in the country $3m would be hard to spend \u2013 even if his case progressed to the high court. The players is seeking $10m in damages from RA and wants his multimillion-dollar contract to be reinstated. RA took issue with a social media post in April in which Folau paraphrased a Bible passage, saying \u201cdrunks, homosexuals, adulterers, liars, fornicators, thieves, atheists and idolaters\u201d would go to hell unless they repented. He took to Instagram on Wednesday to thank his supporters: \u201cI am humbled by the support I have received from so many of you since Rugby Australia terminated my employment contract after I shared a religious message on social media. \u201cTo those who have criticised me, I bear no ill will towards you. You have every right to express your own beliefs and opinions. To the thousands of you who donated to my GoFundMe campaign, I am forever grateful.\u201d By Thursday morning, Folau had raised $2.1m. The ACL\u2019s fundraising effort began on Tuesday, replacing the rugby star\u2019s appeal on GoFundMe that was taken down by the crowdfunding platform for breaching its terms of service.
