They were living in a staff house on campus and students would come and hang, just to be around a family. \u201cThere was one young woman who I loved, I adored her,\u201d the author says, \u201cShe started seeing this older guy who I was quite wary of immediately, there was a big age difference, and he had a back-story I found troubling. \u201cShe came to visit the babies, and she\u2019d been with us maybe an hour when he started hammering on the door, saying, \u2018Where is she? Where is she?\u2019 \u201cAnd this young woman immediately said, \u2018Oh, I told him I was going to be back in 15 minutes\u2019 \u2013 and left.\u201d Heyman reflects on the moment like a salutary lesson: \u201cWhile I did [tell her] at the time that I was instinctively worried about her, I think now that I would be much, much clearer and say, \u2018This sort of behaviour is consistent with this kind of follow-on behaviour,\u2019 but I didn\u2019t really have the language then.\u201d Fifteen years later, the award-winning Australian novelist is well-versed in the patterns of domestic violence and male power. She has the language, certainly, but this ability to elucidate is predated by a deeper familiarity with the subject, stemming from her own childhood with a violent father. Heyman has already written about this. Her first novel, The Breaking, excavated the layers of male violence and control in a family. She didn\u2019t talk about its autobiographical nature at the time, but it\u2019s all there in retrospect \u2013 and now it\u2019s between the lines of her latest novel, Storm and Grace. \u201cMy father was violent, it\u2019s not secret,\u201d says Heyman. She has written explicitly of the fear of the beatings and the bruises and the tears and the trauma that characterised her parents\u2019 22-year marriage. \u201cWhen my parents were engaged my father went off to Japan and had an affair with someone and then came back and charmed my mother into staying with him. He pushed her, that\u2019s all, just a push, but it was like, \u2018You knew! But you overrode it\u2019.\u201d This notion of proceeding into danger in spite of niggling instinct is the fulcrum around which Storm and Grace turns, and Heyman remembers the exact moment the idea gelled for her. \u201cThe Simon Gittany case was happening, and there was all the counting of dead women, and there had been the escalation where the statistics changed \u2013 instead of one woman a week killed by their partners or ex-partners, it was two a week. \u201cI\u2019d been watching the case, reading everything, and I was particularly obsessed with his new girlfriend, who was, quote unquote, \u2018standing by his side\u2019. I couldn\u2019t stop watching her, I was thinking, \u2018What the hell is going on there, you know categorically that this man is dangerous.\u2019\u201d Heyman is talking about Rachel Louise, who accompanied Gittany to his trial for the murder of his fiancee Lisa Harnum, who a court found was thrown by Gittany from their 15th floor apartment balcony after he discovered she planned to leave him. \u201cI kept watching her thinking, \u2018You know. You know he\u2019s dangerous, why are you overriding your instincts?\u2019 She knew he was violent. She might have believed that he did not kill her, but she had seen the footage of him dragging [Lisa] inside with his hand across her mouth, so whatever story she was telling herself, she was overriding what she already knew.\u201d Heyman had been compulsively reading the Gittany case, and the day after he was convicted \u2013 28 November 2013 \u2013 she went scuba diving with her teenage daughter and had a panic attack for the first time after she watched her daughter descend into the murky depths. She had to gather herself, overcome her fear, and proceed with the dive. \u201cIt felt connected to these few weeks of being immersed in and thinking about this really horrific violence,\u201d she says. Reading the news the next day, she saw the story of Nicholas Mevoli \u2013 a world champion in freediving, the sport of diving down into oceanic depths on one breath \u2013 who died while trying to break the record of diving to a depth of 72 metres without fins. Suddenly she can\u2019t get enough of watching freediving videos. Heyman watches the video of Mevoli\u2019s last dive, and is mesmerised by the choices he makes: he goes down, turns around to come back up, then second guesses himself and goes down again \u2013 proceeding into danger. \u201cBam!\u201d, she says, and claps a fist into her palm. Everything coalesces. Enter Storm Hisray and Grace Cain, the characters that materialise in this \u201cperfect meeting\u201d of her various obsessions. He\u2019s a charming egotist and world champion freediver, she a young scuba enthusiast sent to interview the star for a magazine. Their attraction is demanding and obsessive from the start, extreme. Grace leaves her home, her friends, her unfinished university degree to follow the man determined to be the best in the world \u2013 the man also determined to possess the beautiful young Grace. They travel to his free diving headquarters in the Pacific, where Grace is inexorably pulled into an isolated world that is both seductive and dangerous. If it sounds like bodices should be ripping at this point, you\u2019d be missing the point of Storm and Grace. Yes, the broody alpha male is irresistible to the vulnerable young woman but Heyman steps inside this popular culture trope and tears it to shreds. When it comes to dangerous male power, the bodice-ripping is half the problem. \u201cYou look at almost any big pop culture film \u2013 let\u2019s not even talk about the 50 Shades thing \u2013 but there was this thing going around recently, scenes from Star Wars, where Harrison Ford kisses Carrie Fisher and she says, \u2018Don\u2019t you ever do that to me again\u2019, and the next thing they\u2019re all over each other. \u201cOr that scene where the man pushes a woman up against a wall and she finds him unbearably sexy? Girls see so many versions of that scene, or the scene where the girl says \u2018I\u2019ll never kiss you\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019ll never be with you as long as I live\u2019 and then bam, guess what? \u201cAnd we go, \u2018Oh god that\u2019s where the energy is, that\u2019s where the sex is,\u2019 we long for that. That\u2019s Heathcliff. That\u2019s fireworks. And boys see it too. Boys see it too.\u201d Gender stereotypes, the sidelining of female voice and influence, the counting of dead women, dangerous and edgy men romanticised by popular culture \u2013 all this fomented a \u201cwhite hot fury\u201d in Heyman, which in turn compels her plot towards the brutal truth of male violence. While writing she had an overriding urge to be that maternal voice shouting at the young woman to watch out, to see the signs, to look both ways. Heyman cleverly channels this via a chorus of voices that ushers us through the terrible and compelling story, and it\u2019s not a spoiler to say who those voices are \u2013 it\u2019s clear from the beginning. They are the dead women we have been counting. Comments on this article will be premoderated"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
