The law, part of a new penal code submitted to parliament by Alexis Tsipras\u2019 administration only weeks before snap elections, had raised fears of convicted rapists being treated more leniently. In a move hailed as a historic victory by activists, the justice minister Michalis Kalogirou caved in on Thursday. Less than 24 hours after women\u2019s groups had converged on parliament in protest, he amended the bill, known as Article 336, clarifying that sex without consent would be considered rape and, as such, punishable under the law. \u201cWhoever attempts a sexual act without the consent of the victim is punished by imprisonment of up to 10 years,\u201d the revised law states. It is expected to be put to MPs on Friday. Reacting to the last-minute change, the head of Amnesty International\u2019s Greece office, Eirini Gaitanou, said: \u201cThis is a historic victory, not just for the campaigners who have fought long and hard for this day, but for all women in Greece. \u201cThe newly amended law finally recognises the simple truth that sex without consent is rape and makes it clear that physical violence is not required for the crime to be considered rape \u2026 [it] should give hope to people campaigning for consent-based laws wherever they are.\u201d Only a handful of countries have recognised that sex without consent should be treated legally as akin to rape. Once passed, Greece will become only the tenth country in Europe to enshrine that recognition in its criminal code. Gaitanou said it was also imperative that guidelines were given to ensure police and public prosecutors enforced the legislation. \u201cIt is now time for everyone involved in the criminal justice system to be given clear guidance as to how this change in the law must be implemented to make it easier for survivors to get justice,\u201d she said. Before the amendment there had been widespread fears the draft legislation would dramatically weaken laws on rape. It categorised some rapes as a misdemeanour rather than a felony, and critics \u2013 including female members of Tsipras\u2019 Syriza party - had argued that convicted rapists could face prison sentences of as little as three years. In redefining the crime, the new bill all but ignored the issue of freely given consent and focussed instead on the use of violence, resistance involved and the physical threat posed to a victim\u2019s life. Human rights groups had described the lack of emphasis on non-consensual sex as \u201cdeeply problematic\u201d citing \u201cinvoluntary paralysis\u201d or \u201cfreezing\u201d that experts have recognised as an instinctive response to sexual assault. The women\u2019s rights group Equality Now, which had called for the immediate withdrawal of the bill, had argued that the draft legislation offered wide scope in judicial interpretation. Had it been applied, the law would also have amounted to a dereliction of duty for a country that had committed to criminalise non-consensual sexual acts under the Council of Europe\u2019s Istanbul Convention, which Athens ratified last year. \u201cIt is very welcome that the government listened to the voices of women\u2019s rights advocates in Greece and other experts to make changes to the law,\u201d Equality Now\u2019s Europe director, Jacqui Hunt, said. \u201cAnything that lets potential perpetrators of sexual violence off the hook creates an environment for further violence and does a huge disservice to the women affected.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
