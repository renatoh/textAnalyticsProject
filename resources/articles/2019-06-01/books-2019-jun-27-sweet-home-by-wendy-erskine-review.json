To borrow from the balding man in a grey jacket, who makes a brief appearance commenting on the music of a fictional Belfast rocker in the penultimate story, each of these acutely observed portraits \u201cpenetrates to the heart of what it means to be lonely, or in love or to feel a failure\u201d. An exceptional ear for dialogue, an impeccable semantic rhythm and an uncanny ability to tease laughter out of the darkest moments mean Erskine is perfectly poised to stare, unflinching, into our neoliberal abyss. The result is a gripping, wonderfully understated book that oozes humanity, emotion and humour. The first story, \u201cTo All Their Dues\u201d, opens in a beauty parlour. When Kyle walks in, it\u2019s clear he\u2019s not seeking the back, sack and crack treatment. He\u2019s after money: he calls it \u201ccommunity\u201d, we\u2019d call it a protection racket. Kyle is terrifying. On a visit to his brother\u2019s grave, he forces flowers into the mouth of a man who has inadvertently upset him: \u201cHe was making a choking sound and the flowers were falling apart but he still kept pushing.\u201d The story unfolds in three parts. First we hear from Mo, who did time \u201con the fortune telling\u201d at a call centre while studying for the beauty qualifications to get the parlour started; then Kyle, who helped his brother kill their alcoholic and violent father; then the only person Kyle trusts, his girlfriend, Grace, who has learned to expect little more from life than \u201cholidays and meals and trips to the multiplex and city breaks\u201d. Early on, you feel this is heading towards an unpleasant climax, with Kyle\u2019s violent temper at its core, but as Erskine pulls us in deeper, comfortably leaping back and forth across time, she unearths the contradictions that shape a life \u2013 leaving us to work out why our sympathy just took another U-turn. In \u201cInakeen\u201d, a widow called Jean observes, with increasing affection, her new Somali neighbours. Occasionally, her obnoxious son drops in to watch television and complain about his ex, \u201cthat bitch\u201d, who has returned to Canada with their son. The day Jean learned her grandson was leaving, \u201cit had started to rain and everything around was ugly\u201d. Now, she misses the little boy and his mother more than her late husband, \u201csomeone she once overheard being described as a fellow who would put a bob on himself both ways\u201d. The tedium of Jean\u2019s life is excruciating, her feeling of abandonment searing. While Erskine shows no interest in triumphant endings, by layering one \u201clittle chip of humanity\u201d on another she creates a tenderness that resounds. \u201cObservation\u201d offers hilarious insights into the relationship between a pair of teenagers, Cath and Lauren, and Lauren\u2019s mum, Kim Cassells \u2013 \u201cnever just plain Kim\u201d. Cath\u2019s commentary is irresistible: Kim Cassells\u2019s two-tone hair reminds her of \u201ca broken Kinder egg\u201d; being close to Kim Cassells makes Cath \u201cfeel lumpen\u201d; Kim Cassells\u2019s tattoo, Only God Can Judge Me, proves \u201cmortal opinion was of no interest to her\u201d. Cath is strangely fascinated by her friend\u2019s mum and her string of boyfriends, the latest a creep called Stuart. As the observations stack up, though, Kim Cassells\u2019s insecurities are revealed. Erskine captures beautifully the painful neglect of her daughter, and the endearing way in which Cath tries to protect her best mate. All 10 stories are set in Belfast, where Erskine was born in 1968. Readers expecting tales of the Troubles will find glimpses and shadows, but her literary microscope is mostly focused elsewhere, on women and men contending with everyday boredom and disappointment. Like the couple in the title story, whose marriage has been crumbling since the death of their six-year-old. Gavin puts up with \u201cthose dreary and micro-managed handjobs\u201d, but he can\u2019t forgive Susan for the \u201cunspeakably quiet and modest\u201d funeral she had insisted on. Susan, meanwhile, has longed to have a breakdown \u2013 \u201cit would have been a relief\u201d \u2013 but she\u2019s so brittle, it just won\u2019t come. Others die as they lived, \u201cin front of the TV\u201d. Those left behind seem resigned to the idea that there\u2019s \u201ca time for this, a time for that, a time for whatever\u201d. They are looking for a bit of love and a bit of safety, a bit of hope for a bit of a future. It\u2019s not easy, though, when the place where you live is as tired as you are, \u201clike it can\u2019t be bothered with the afternoon either and longs for the shutters down\u201d. People stare out of their windows, or go for pointless walks looking into shop windows. They collect online vouchers for cheap meals at restaurants with inconvenient time constraints. They are trying either to destroy their past or forget some violence it served up \u2013 but the remembered sight of a murder, \u201cthe obscenity of an exploded head\u201d, can surface in the most uneventful of lives. Still, Erskine\u2019s subjects do their best to cope. They are trying to keep up; they are trying to reach out. They are doing their best to free themselves from the undertow of their lives. \u2022 Lara Pawson\u2019s This Is the Place to Be is published by CB Editions.
