Either way Newcastle would secure it before they next play \u2013 on Monday at Plymouth Argyle \u2013 if West Brom fail to beat Middlesbrough on Saturday. \"We are very close now and we can sew it up on Monday now. Whichever way it happens we'll be delighted,\" said Chris Hughton, the Newcastle manager. \"There are no celebrations tonight, it is business as normal but we have put ourselves in a great position. You saw what we are about. Reading were better than us for periods but we saw it out.\" With around 4,000 travelling fans in attendance last night, Nolan scored his first when taking control 12 yards out and rolling a defender before hammering a left-foot shot through the grasp of Adam Federici. The second came when he turned in a Wayne Routledge cross before half-time. \"Kevin has a composure about him and he has been a regular goalscorer throughout his career,\" added Hughton. \"He has played in a team this season that has created a lot of chances and there is no one better at getting in the box at the right times.\" At the top of League One, Norwich City lost 2\u20131 at relegation-threatened Leyton Orient, Sean Thornton scoring either side of Korey Smith's reply in the first half as the lowly Londoners, who thrashed Newcastle 6-1 in a pre-season friendly, moved into 19th place ahead of Gillingham, 1-1 with Brighton. Tranmere Rovers, in 21st, lost 2-0 at home to Wycombe, moreover, which made it an even better evening for the Brisbane Road caretaker manager, Russell Slade. A last-minute equaliser from the Tottenham loanee Jonathan Obika stretched Millwall's unbeaten run to 11 games after Dean Bowditch's 26th- minute opener for Yeovil Town put the skids under their push for automatic promotion. The 1-1 draw saw them slip to third behind Leeds United, who were one up at Carlisle after 13 minutes thanks to Luciano Becchio, starting in place of the dropped Jermaine Beckford and on hand to score from close range. Richard Keogh equalised two minutes before the interval but goals from Max Gradel and a second from Becchio made it 3-1 and allowed the Leeds fans to savour a third successive victory. Charlton had the on-loan forward Nicky Forster to thank as they saw off Colchester United 1-0 at The Valley and moved up ahead of Swindon to fourth. United's Kevin Lisbie, the former Charlton forward, was sent off for two bookable offences. Phil Parkinson's side next host Norwich on Saturday and will be looking to maintain their recent improvement. Huddersfield, in sixth, won 4\u20133 against Walsall, who had Mark Hughes sent off after 20 minutes. A penalty from Theo Robinson and an injury-time effort from Jordan Rhodes put them two up at the interval although a double from Troy Deeney levelled it and a third from Alex Nicholls saw them trailing. Antony Kay equalised in the last minute and the substitute Lee Novak secured full points in injury-time. They are now three points clear of seventh-placed Colchester and face Millwall on Friday. Bristol Rovers took the lead at home to Southampton but their former striker Rickie Lambert scored two before half-time to take him to 27 league goals for season. Morgan Schneiderlin, Adam Lallana and Jason Puncheon made it 5-1 with 15 minutes to go as they moved up to eighth and not for the first time had their fans wondering what might have been if they had not started the season under penalty of a 10-point deduction. In League Two Darlington, now under the control of Simon Davey, managed a creditable 1-0 win at Rochdale, although they still slipped into the Conference while Dale, in front of an expectant crowd of 5,371 who were expecting to see the club's first promotion in 36 years, were left to wait a few more days as their team slipped into second place. Notts County went top with a 3-1 home win over Lincoln City but technically need a point for promotion still. As they host Rochdale on Tuesday, one of the two is definitely up. Lee Hughes got them under way after a minute although the visitors played with 10 men after Moses Swaibu was sent off in the 16th minute."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
