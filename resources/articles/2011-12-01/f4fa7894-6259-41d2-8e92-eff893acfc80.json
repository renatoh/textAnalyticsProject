My uncle puts the car in neutral at the top of any slope he comes to and coasts down to save petrol, so you'll have to go quite far in your parsimony to impress me. Fortunately, the Cutting Edge team had found Judith, Rebekah, Stephen, Jonathan and Jalaj for The Ultimate Guide to Penny Pinching (Channel 4) \u2013 each of whom could choke a penny to death, never mind pinch it. For Judith, a visit to the supermarket not spent forcing some poor cashier to scan a two-inch-thick bundle of vouchers through her till is a visit wasted. She has a freezerful of freebies, over a year's supply of Dove deodorant (\"they were five, 10p each in one offer\") in the bedroom, a very, very quiet husband and two sons who treat her with the kind of patiently resigned affection that neither money nor coupons can buy. Judith's mother thinks she gets it from her dad: \"I never had a new washing machine,\" she sighs, \"because Alan kept insisting on repairing it. It was mostly held together by Araldite.\" Rebekah and Steven, affianced to \u2013 fortunately \u2013 each other, had a self-determined wedding budget of \u00a31,500. The meal was a finger buffet washed down with orange squash. \"\u00a31 a litre!\" said Rebekah. \"We bought 35.\" Her face was a picture of happiness, her guests' less so. \"I'd have had a few bottles of wine myself,\" said one girl friend of the bride, carefully. \"But that's just me.\" She was outdone in stoicism only by Jonathan's friends, who \u2013 when they discovered at his barbecue that they were eating roadkill pheasant, woodpigeon and squirrel \u2013 said brightly: \"Nice balance!\" and \"Very lean!\" Only the thousand-yard stares gave them away. His freezer is packed with such free fare. I imagine Judith's children at this point lunged for the TV off switch before she could get any more ideas. Before the weekly shop, Jalaj and his wife compile a list of the best (by price, weight and shelf life) deals from the web. \"It saves money for your family and for your future! It can't be wrong!\" he explains. At the supermarket, his wife sometimes spots a potentially better bargain. Jalaj scans the barcodes with his iPhone. \"I agree!\" he cries joyfully. \"Update the list!\" Jalaj is a man I could live with very happily. His wife, a former shopaholic, has been converted by Jalaj's enthusiasm. Let's hope her new faith sustains her 20 years down the line, when every device in the house is more Araldite than appliance. It was a fun documentary that kept \u2013 just \u2013 on the right side of the point-and-laugh line but still \u2026 you expect something with a bit more heft from Channel 4's flagship documentary series. A weightier subject, or even just a deeper delving into the psychology of saving versus spending. When does coupon-clipping move from useful tool to overwhelming obsession? If it's only about saving money, then surely Judith would get a full-time job. So is she filling empty hours, or driven by a deeper need? Jonathan said his roadkill habit and general frugality began of necessity when he was in foster care, but this was not explored. What made Rebekah and Stephen's approach to saving seem like petty meanness while Jalaj's seemed endearing? And where, above all, can I get some Araldite? America in Pictures: The Story of Life Magazine (BBC4) did exactly what it said on the tin, especially if the tin also read \"with a slightly dreary voiceover by the presenter, photographer Rankin, but it doesn't matter because the pictures speak for themselves\". It traced the history of the magazine \u2013 which at its peak was read by over half the US population and brought in $17.5m profit a year \u2013 its symbiotic relationship with the public, showing and shaping the country and the image it had of itself, the invention of photojournalism, and its weekly demonstration of the truth that a picture \u2013 be it of a country doctor's travails, a heroin addict's day or VJ celebrations \u2013 is worth a thousand words. It was undone, in the end, by the advent of celebrity culture in the 1970s and the new window on the world that was television. We should all mourn the passing. Which brings us neatly to It's All About Amy (Channel 5), the equally perfect demonstration of what celebrity culture has come to mean. Amy Childs was made famous in scripted reality TV show The Only Way Is Essex by her mastery of vajazzling (don't look it up). She then did Celebrity Big Brother and was told by TOWIE that she was now \"not real enough\" for the show. So she got her own show. She's utterly charming and a natural on camera, although there is nothing \u2013 hair, teeth, eyelashes, tan, boobs \u2013 natural about her. The programme is dreadful.
