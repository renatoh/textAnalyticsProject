With the demise of the ACT Marriage Equality (Same Sex) Act 2013 a legal reality, the process of strategic soul searching for equal rights advocates surely centres upon answering one question: what to do next? There could be hope for same-sex marriages to be ratified in a future amendment of the federal Marriage Act 1961 by a future government, whereas the states and territories can \u2013 and in the case of Tasmania does \u2013 provide for some form of civil union recognition for gay couples. But for many gay couples across Australia, civil unions represent something of a consolation prize. How long do they have to wait for a meaningful change in policy from the federal government to gain truly equal treatment before the law? I would argue that the most credible way forward for the gay community is to keep embracing what is a quintessentially classical liberal position of equality of legal treatment, but to add to that by arguing that the state ought not be involved in marriage recognition whatsoever. After all, what business is it of government to know about our love lives, even if it is a simple list of who is married, and to whom? And given how government crimps economic and personal liberties with alacrity, who could really trust politicians and bureaucrats with such personal information anyway? The basic idea behind marriage privatisation is that two (or even more, if so inclined) people, either gay, straight, or whomever else, can strike their own marriage contracts. Within those contracts, people can arrange their own standards concerning next of kin nomination, sharing of property rights, duties of care, parental rights, and even the process of relationship dissolution, under such arrangements. Consenting adults could ratify their own marriage contracts wherever they like, and the established religious orders would remain free to accept, or not accept, the process of ratifying marriage contracts between individuals. It is difficult to see why marriage privatisation is not more widely perceived as an appealing way to go beyond the current impasse between marriage equality advocates wanting institutional change, and the gaggle of social conservatives and religiously devout seeking to maintain the status quo. For gay couples around Australia, basically asking all and sundry to embrace a \"live, and let live\" attitude with respect to love, marriage privatisation would surely fit their needs perfectly. The Christian, Jewish, Islamic, Hindu, Sikh and Buddhist faiths would survive under freedom of association, and even for social conservatives, nothing they treasure about traditional family life would be lost. Perhaps the most overlooked aspect of the marriage privatisation proposal is that, as of today, gays and lesbians in fact enjoy the right to establish their own private marriage arrangements, in whichever form they please. We know this is true because of the limited, but very insightful, Australian literature on same-sex marriages of generations past, particularly those chronicling lesbian lives. In the early 20th century, Annie/Harry Payne impersonated a man in order to earn a male wage, and married two women during her adult life. Prominent medical professional Kerryn Phelps and her partner, Jackie Stricker, married in New York to great publicity in the late 1990s. Since then many gay couples, in the hundreds if not thousands, have travelled to marriage-equality jurisdictions overseas to get hitched there, arriving back at unequal-marriage Australia sometime thereafter. Were any of these people less married because their relationships were not officially recognised by the state? The answer to this is, self evidently, \"no.\" The Abbott government could strike a massive blow for civil liberty by repealing the Marriage Act during its next regulatory \"repeal day\" sessions. They should do it if they\u02bcre serious about promoting freedom in this country but, let\u02bcs face it, that is merely wishful thinking. Another gender-crosser of the early twentieth century, Marion/Bill Edwards, said of her wife, \"when two loving hearts beat as one, there was only one thing to do, and that was to get married, and that was exactly what we did.\" Rather than wait, maybe in vain, for the political chips to fall the way of marriage equality, gays and lesbians should embrace Edwards\u02bcs fine sentiments and not wait for state approval of their relationships. So marry now, as a simple but blissful act recognising a shared love, or even as an act of civil disobedience thumbing noses at the bigoted state. But don\u02bct wait for that elusive political blessing to marry that special someone you love. \u2022 Julie Novak is senior fellow, Institute of Public Affairs.
