Maximum batting points for 400 now look a struggle; the inability of any one batsman to muster a big score to ease such progress hinting at understandable distraction as Sussex's total soared in the Midlands. As ever here, the decision to bat first by the captain Mark Chilton had been correct. But it required some circumspection from him and partner Iain Sutcliffe as the much-improved James Bruce's bustling command of a good length impressed. The left-armer James Tomlinson's first championship bowl since 2004 proved fruitless, still not swinging the ball into the right-hander sufficiently. Sixty-three represented a solid start, only ended by the contentious decision of umpire Barry Dudleston to judge Sutcliffe caught behind off Dimitri Mascarenhas; bat appearing to make contact only with pad. Sutcliffe's displeasure was obvious. In contrast there can only have been delight earlier when Shane Warne, shorn of the bowling services of Sean Ervine, turned to the gentle left-arm swing of James Adams for four overs. Both Chilton and Sutcliffe tucked in eagerly but, when Bruce returned, Chilton could do little about a bouncing leg-cutter. So Loye and Law were united in demonstrating their considerable quality with a flurry of off-side drives and cuts. To think they only have one Test cap between them, Law's solitary call up coming against Sri Lanka in 1995. His easing of Warne against the spin through mid-wicket was the best of his seven boundaries while Loye hit none of his 10 fours more firmly than that which brought fifty through cover off Mascarenhas. Both succumbed to the off-spin of Greg Lamb, who was given an opportunity ahead of Shaun Udal. Catch of the day went to Warne, diving low to his right to dismiss Nathan Astle four runs after Hampshire had been convinced he had edged behind."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
