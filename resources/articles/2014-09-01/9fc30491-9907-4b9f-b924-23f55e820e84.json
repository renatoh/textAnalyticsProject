The club\u2019s under-21s coach will get his first chance to impress when Fulham entertain Blackburn Rovers at Craven Cottage on Saturday and the former Wales international has described his promotion as \u201ca great opportunity for me at a club I know very well and love very much\u201d. Following last season\u2019s relegation from the Premier League the Cottagers are anchored to the bottom of the Championship with one point from a possible 21 after a nightmarish start to the season. But despite their current predicament, Symons is confident he can turn things round. \u201cIt\u2019s been a difficult time for the football club,\u201d he says. \u201cI think everybody wants and craves stability at Fulham and I aim to bring that back.\u201d The former Celtic manager Neil Lennon told the BBC on Friday night that he was interested in the Fulham post and the vacancy at Cardiff City. \u201cThey are two excellent clubs,\u201d he told Radio 5 Live. \u201cWould I be interested in managing either of them? Of course I would.\u201d Khan has pledged to undertake \u201can exhaustive, thorough and deliberate\u201d search for a new manager but has confirmed Symons will have an opportunity to stake a claim. \u201cI plan to summon a number of qualified advisers for input, some within or close to the Fulham family and others who will bring a perspective from outside the club,\u201d \u201cAs Kit Symons takes the reins as our caretaker manager, I will personally lead the search for our next first-team manager,\u201d said Khan, writing in his programme notes for Saturday\u2019s game. \u201cTo address the obvious question as to whether Kit will be in consideration, the answer is yes. But this will be an exhaustive, thorough and deliberate process. No decisions will be made for the sake of deadlines or convenience. \u201cI plan to summon a number of qualified advisors for input, some within or close to the Fulham family and others who will bring a perspective from outside the club. In the end the decision will be mine, but the choice will be made with the benefit of excellent and highly respected counsel.\u201d Symons, having previously performed caretaker duties at Crystal Palace and Colchester, feels he has the necessary experience to succeed Magath, having won two promotions for Fulham as a player before working in their scouting network and coaching various youth teams. \u201cNo one understands the fabric of this football club better than me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big job but I\u2019m really excited and very confident that we can start moving up the table very, very soon.\u201d Invited to offer his opinion on Magath\u2019s training methods, which are reported to have prompted no end of disquiet among his former players, Symons was diplomacy itself. \u201cI\u2019ve not really seen too much of what\u2019s been going on during the week, so it\u2019s not really for me to comment on,\u201d he said. Subsequent remarks about results being \u201ca by-product of the work you do and the environment you create\u201d may have told a different story, even if Symons was describing his own methods. \u201cI\u2019ve got full confidence in the way I coach and the way I train and the way I manage and these players are going to love it,\u201d he enthused. \u201cI think doing the basics well is key. I do an attacking day, a defensive day, a transition day and if we\u2019ve got time, we\u2019ll work on the set pieces. Other than those four things, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s too much in a game of football you need to worry about.\u201d With no set time frame in which to stake his claim for the job full-time, Symons has already been in contact with Bryan Ruiz, the Costa Rica midfielder who is one of very few fit senior players not to have been given a game by Magath at some point this season. \u201cI spoke to him last night,\u201d said Symons. \u201cHe\u2019s very upbeat and confident.\u201d He isn\u2019t the only one. \u201cI\u2019ve been given an opportunity and it\u2019s one I intend to take with both hands,\u201d the caretaker added. Online polls suggest put-upon Fulham fans are already firmly behind Symons, who they would like to see in charge of their floundering club."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
