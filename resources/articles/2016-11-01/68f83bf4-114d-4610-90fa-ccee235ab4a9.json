How right he is. The challenges confronting western democracies as 2016 draws to a ragged close are of a breadth and intensity not seen since the early 1980s, when Leonid Brezhnev\u2019s Soviet Union was expanding its nuclear arsenal and suppressing Solidarity in Poland. Today, Russia under Vladimir Putin is again building bombs and meddling in neighbours\u2019 affairs. But he is not the only or even the biggest problem. Much of the danger to democracy comes from within. Angela Merkel, Germany\u2019s long-serving chancellor, and Obama struggled with this issue during meetings in Berlin that included walk-on parts for the leaders of France, Britain, Italy and Spain. The (Republican) elephant in the room was Donald Trump. Nobody mentioned him by name. But the threat to democratic values and the transatlantic alliance that sustains them implicit in his victory was the subject of a pointed article written by Obama and Merkel, and published in a German weekly. So great is the uncertainty about the political direction of travel in the US and Europe that the two leaders went back to basics, stressing their \u201cshared commitment to personal freedom and dignity, which only a vibrant democracy under the rule of law can guarantee\u201d. This included \u201cjoint responsibility to protect and preserve our way of life,\u201d they wrote. \u201cToday we find ourselves at a crossroads \u2013 the future is upon us and we will never return to a pre-globalisation economy.\u201d Merkel and Obama were evidently talking about a Trumpist agenda that questions the Euro-Atlantic settlement and Nato\u2019s relevance, mocks climate change, opposes free trade and treats refugees, Muslims and foreigners in general as potential enemies. Their references to pluralism and international law were obvious shots across Putin\u2019s bows. But their message was also directed at Europe. Their concerns are justified. The fear now is that the populist and nationalist insurrections witnessed in Britain in June and in the US this month may be replicated across Europe in coming months, further shredding the west\u2019s liberal democratic moorings. France is of foremost concern. This weekend saw the start of a primary process to select the centre-right\u2019s candidate for two-stage presidential elections next spring. This decision is crucial since the French left is largely discredited. Its leader, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, is a deeply unpopular president. Should Alain Jupp\u00e9, a former PM, beat rivals Nicolas Sarkozy and Fran\u00e7ois Fillon for the centre-right\u2019s nomination, as polls suggest, it is assumed he will win a second round run-off in May. It is a dangerous assumption. Conventional wisdom has never been more discredited. Pollsters tread treacherous ground. And Jupp\u00e9, 71, is very ancien regime. He lost the prime ministership 20 years ago amid a revolt against Jacques Chirac. He was later convicted of criminal abuse of public funds. Last week, Jupp\u00e9 was forced to reject comparisons with the US election. \u201cI am not Hillary Clinton. And France is not America,\u201d he declared. His protestations will do nothing to quiet the many voices now suggesting Marine Le Pen, the far-right, anti-immigration Front National leader and ardent admirer of Trump and Nigel Farage, has a chance to score another populist upset. It is taken for granted that Le Pen, 48, will reach the second round. But for the first time, the idea she could then beat Jupp\u00e9, or any other centre-right candidate, and win outright is taken seriously. Manuel Valls, France\u2019s prime minister, admitted last week it was entirely possible. It is a dreadful prospect. France may be part of a trend. If polls are correct, parliamentary elections in the Netherlands in March could see the triumph of Geert Wilders, an anti-Islam extremist who advocates a Dutch exit (Nexit) from the EU. Wilders predicts he will win partly because of Merkel\u2019s \u201cstupidity\u201d in opening Europe\u2019s doors to Syrian refugees. In Italy, the centre-left prime minister, Matteo Renzi, looks set to lose a controversial referendum on constitutional reform, and his job, next month. Pollsters say the \u201cno\u201d campaign, led by the anti-establishment Five Star movement (M5S), is benefiting from a \u201cTrump effect\u201d. Germany has elections, too, next year, which if she stands again, Merkel will be expected to win. But even in Berlin, the electoral balance is shifting in threatening, ugly and intolerant ways as the populist Alternative for Germany and the anti-Islamists of Pegida advance. With Obama no longer around to defend the west\u2019s liberal democratic order, Merkel could be the last woman standing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
