Cars and commercial vehicles that approach turn back or risk being stoned, while pedestrians wade on through the smoke. Standing among a group of young men overseeing proceedings is Wandy Drelien, 28. Beneath the fabric of his khaki shirt, pushed into the waistband of his trousers, a pistol bulges. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting against a system where we can\u2019t eat and we don\u2019t get paid. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve taken to the streets,\u201d he explains as a jet flies in low overhead to land at the airport. \u201cThe president [Jovenel Mo\u00efse] isn\u2019t working for us,\u201d Drelien adds. \u201cHe\u2019s no friend of the people. Only of the bourgeoisie and businessmen, while we live in poverty. \u201cIt\u2019s why young people have given up at school and taken up the gun. Because we need to defeat to this for ourselves.\u201d The sentiments are familiar in the crisis in Haiti that has flared up over the past year. Intermittent protests have seen roads blockaded and offices and institutions associated with the government attacked, including the major\u2019s office in the city of L\u00e9og\u00e2ne, about 42km from Port-au-Prince, which was petrol bombed and looted. Schools opened again this week after two months of large-scale protests almost completely paralysed the country. But as a semblance of what passes for normality returns, the causes of the crisis remain amid evidence of a darker, more covert strand of violence now emerging: the supply of weapons and cash to armed gangs by figures on both sides. While the proximate reason for the turmoil in Haiti has been a long running multi-billion dollar corruption scandal that has engulfed the presidency of Mo\u00efse, it has exacerbated tensions in a place long racked by brutal poverty and extreme inequality where political dishonesty has long been commonplace. Central to the protests is the Petrocaribe scandal, a controversy that arose from a scheme to buy discounted oil from Venezuela on cheap credit. The idea was to free up funds for social schemes, but the money thus freed got pocketed by politicians. The upwelling of popular outrage that greeted the official report into the scandal, which has tied Mo\u00efse to at least knowledge of the misappropriation, has played out in Creole slogans painted on walls demanding \u201cKot kob Petrokaribe?\u201d (\u201cWhere\u2019s the Petrocaribe money?\u201d). The scandal is debated angrily around the clock on radio talk shows, and denounced in the music of rappers, like Izolan, whose song Lage Pye Ou \u2013 Step On it \u2013 has been taken up by demonstrators. Opposition spokesman Andre Michel believes the unrest is down to the culmination of several factors. \u201cThe first is the circumstances around the election of Jovenel Mo\u00efse as president, a victory that was not accepted by the other candidates. \u201cThe second is a structural issue. Ever since its foundation, Haiti has been ruled by an oligarchic minority who have held the country hostage. We have a political system that allows a small number of people to take all the country\u2019s wealth.\u201d That, adds Michel, is the point dramatised by the Petrocaribe scandal. \u201cThe money was supposed to pay for education, hospitals, roads and agricultural development,\u201d he says of the billions misappropriated by those in government. \u201cNot a single hospital has been built or a single training centre.\u201d And the crisis is biting beyond politics. Disruption on the roads, combined with rising commodity prices and the depreciation of the Haitian gourde against the US dollar, has reduced the ability of Haiti\u2019s poorest to buy food. According to a joint statement by humanitarian organisations, already 35% of the Haitian population \u2013 an estimated 3.67 million people \u2013 require emergency food assistance. If nothing is done, that will rise to 4.1 million people \u2013 roughly 40% of the Haitian population \u2013 within the next three to five months. The dire state of affairs is summed up by security guard Junior Estinfort, 31, a father of two, who the Guardian meets outside the looted mayor\u2019s office in L\u00e9og\u00e2ne. Even before the attack on the building, he had not received his salary for six months. Unlike many, Estinfort believes Mo\u00efse should serve out his term until 2022, but he complains the system has been \u201cturned upside down\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m relying on handouts from friends just to survive,\u201d he says. Much is spoken about \u201cthe system\u201d in Haiti \u2013 la machine, as it is known colloquially. Talk of it is rivalled only by conversational use of the word pagaille, denoting utter chaos. Even those associated with the government are critical. \u201cIt is a nightmare,\u201d says Newton Louis St Juste, a government lawyer. \u201cEveryone is fighting for power.\u201d If many of St Juste\u2019s criticisms of the situation echo that of opposition figures, where he differs is blaming the opposition for many of the same sins as the government. Both sides, he suggests, are implicated in violence and corruption \u2013 including in the Petrocaribe scandal \u2013 in a weak state where politics have been co-opted by business interests. \u201cOn the one side you have an opposition that won\u2019t wait for the next elections in 2022 and on the other a president who can\u2019t deliver because he does not have the resources to solve the country\u2019s problems.\u201d In a place where gangs are better armed than the police, he adds, a sense of impunity is running riot, from the white collar criminals and corrupt politicians at the apex down to the poorest slums. Mo\u00efse \u2013 who critics say has rarely been seen outside the wealthy neighbourhood of P\u00e9tion-Ville, and who appears bolstered by the support of the US, which has sent senior diplomats in a show of solidarity \u2013 is more forthright. He has referred to a plot by individuals with interests in Haiti\u2019s energy sector to unseat him and accused the opposition of holding the country hostage, adding: \u201cIs it the resignation of the president that will free the state? No, it is reform.\u201d For now, however, the trajectory is not negotiation or political process, but rising political violence that has already claimed dozens of lives. Amnesty and other human rights organisations say they have validated claims of indiscriminate live fire on demonstrators by police. And other, more shadowy gunmen also appear to be at work. According to the National Human Rights Defence Network, a Haitian NGO, in a single month between 16 September and 17 October at least 35 deaths occurred in the context of protests alone, including at least nine at the hands of the police. In the same period, they reported that more than 200 people were injured, including at least eight journalists. In neighbourhoods like the capital\u2019s Martissant, long notorious for its insecurity and lethal gang violence, credible local human rights groups suggest that political figures are arming and paying gunmen to settle scores against opponents on the street. In a tiny, one-room house in Port-au-Prince\u2019s Solino slum, Jean Charles Jean Clauzel, aged 41, and other anti-Mo\u00efse activists gathered to meet the Guardian. Jean Clauzel explains he has moved his place of residence multiple times, fearful of being targeted by paid gunmen. His fears are apparently not without foundation. According to a November report by the human rights group Fondasyon Je Klere, there may be reasons to fear that political assassinations are returning to the country\u2019s politics. Je Klere lists a number of incidents to underline its concerns, including several involving passengers in cars without number plates firing on demonstrations. The group also cites the killing on 29 September of the political activist Josemano Victorieux, known as \u201cBadou\u201d, whose murder has been marked by memorial banners draped over his Delmas 33 neighbourhood. Jean Clauzel and the other activists have another reason to be concerned. Accompanying them is nine-year-old Dera Lourdjy, who was shot in the arm by an unseen gunman during a demonstration in the neighbourhood on 4 November. She is one of several children who have been caught in the crossfire. \u201cThe situation is not good at all,\u201d says Jean Clauzel. \u201cIt\u2019s why many of the activists are trying to stay away from trouble. I\u2019ve moved multiple times and I\u2019ve only slept around seven nights in this house in total. If they find me, I\u2019m worried they will kill me.\u201d If opposition figures point the finger at the government, it is a two-way street. \u201cThe president has broken his promises. He needs to understand that people are tired and angry,\u201d says Arnel B\u00e9lizaire, a charismatic former deputy and opposition leader who the Guardian meets at his warehouse, where workers are loading up a truck with planks. \u201cHe does not respect democratic norms. He has become arrogant and refuses to resign.\u201d Barely two days after his interview with the Guardian, B\u00e9lizaire is arrested for allegedly attempting to deliver weapons and ammunition to the city of Jacmel with seven other individuals. He is accused of \u201cconspiring against the state\u201d, and images of the weapons are shared with the Haitian media. Haiti\u2019s crisis seems far from over."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
