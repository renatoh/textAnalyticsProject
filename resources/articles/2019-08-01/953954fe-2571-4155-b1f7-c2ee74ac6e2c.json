It was wrapped up in an episode that managed to have a few interesting twists and turns but was, in some ways, a teeny bit muddled. In the most predictable plot development since Sir Evil George turning out to still be extremely evil, Ned found himself in prison and on trial for treason. This was always going to happen and it has been, in many ways, a very long and painful time coming. Now there are two questions to take us up to the end of this series. One, if Ned goes down, then how can Ross not go down with him? And, two, if Ned doesn\u2019t go down, then can Sir Evil George still triumph in some way against Ross? This episode still had plenty of old-school Poldark joy to offer (Christmas scenes, the children heading into Mrs Carne\u2019s school, John Conan\u2019s grandmother being a grumpy old battleaxe). But it also had a few missteps. Is my timing off or are we supposed to have completely forgotten that Kitty was pregnant and might have had a miscarriage? Or could she still be pregnant? Meanwhile, the slavery debate became complicated with the transformation of Sir Evil George into some kind of pro-slavery campaigner. (Good luck with that, George!) At the same time we seemed to veer very quickly away from Honduras and slavery into proclamations that \u201cthe King is mad\u201d. Plus, the Irish question was also randomly thrown in for good measure. Some sleight of hand and a little simplicity might have rendered this all a bit easier to swallow. But never mind. \u2019T\u2019is still Poldark. The subplot about the forging of the magic money paper was entertaining and a good way for Demelza to reassert her authority over Tess without risking too much. \u201cWhy would a body do such a thing?\u201d Well, if a body was sacked by Demelza, a body might be very angry and vengeful. That t\u2019is why. (\u201cI\u2019ve saved you a hanging, missy,\u201d was the basic conclusion; I paraphrase.) The scenes bridging the gap between \u201cthe action in London\u201d and \u201cthe action in Cornwall\u201d were very nicely balanced here. Including the heart-wrenching will-they-won\u2019t-they business over the potential kidnapping of four-year-old velvet-clad fencing enthusiast John Conan, which was handled brilliantly. (More effusive praise and the awarding of the pewter tankard below.) Back in London, though, and true to form, Ned was turning out to be a most annoyingly ineffectual and indiscreet revolutionary, resplendent in full Bob Geldof Live Aid mode. Obviously I agree with Ned\u2019s anti-slavery views as t\u2019is only right and proper. But I would seriously not like to get stuck next to him at a dinner party. To be fair on Ned, #TeamSlavery are a miserable bunch with very poor taste in house pets. The falcon (is it a falcon?) is gaining an ever-more prominent role and has started squawking menacingly. If Horace the Pug finds out about this usurper, he\u2019s going to be livid. In the next drawing room along, Geoffrey Charles made his eventual ill-fated proposal. Sir Evil George added insult to injury by wilfully throwing Elizabeth\u2019s child under the bus and agreeing to marriage with Cecily just to spite Geoffrey Charles. I decided to withdraw my previously sympathetic comments about Sir Evil George long before his speech entitled: \u201cLet Me Commend To You the Mahogany Trade.\u201d Although it was completely hilarious that he thought he could give the most racist speech in the history of racist speeches and still ask afterwards: \u201cBut why is everyone saying that I am a racist?\u201d (I make no comment about echoes with the present day.) Well, I suppose there was no better character to espouse the bonkers \u201clogic\u201d of racism. \u201cI am viewed as a friend of heartless slave-owners.\u201d Could that possibly be because you are the friend of heartless slave-owners, Sir Evil George? Put him back in the water-boarding bath with the leeches. Luckily, Cecily had some morals and was able to leak the letter telling the truth about the wildly uncommendable nature of the mahogany trade. And she knows that the only way to fix any of this is to \u201cdrive a wedge between my father and Sir (Evil) George. With a little more charm, she is a Sindy Doll in the making. Meanwhile, Sindy Doll herself reminded us of how brilliant she is at diplomacy. Thank heavens for real friends who know where they need to be at the right time. During the search of Ross\u2019s house, Sindy Doll was truly using her poshness to the best effect. \u201cYou were magnificent!\u201d \u201cYes, I was.\u201d But you always are, Sindy Doll, you always are! Pewter tankard award for bonkers brilliance as supporting actor The relationship between Drake (Harry Richardson) and Morwenna (Ellise Chappell) has very occasionally been trying, as long-term viewers will recall. (I think the word \u201csimpering\u201d may have been used in the below-the-line comments.) However, I think over time these two have truly earned our respect and the scenes in this episode were beautifully done, from Drake\u2019s desperation to do the right thing and his anguish that this always seems beyond him, to Morwenna\u2019s sadness at leaving her child and her eventual stoic acceptance of reality. As I\u2019ve mentioned in regard to other pairings in this series, the chemistry between these two actors is perfect. They\u2019ve managed to turn something that could be cloying and irritating into a poignant and believable relationship. I, for one, am ready to donate the contents of my purse to Mrs Carne\u2019s School for Learnin\u2019. Coins only, obviously. (Side note: was it my imagination or did they keep changing the child actor for John Conan? What happened there and why did they think we wouldn\u2019t notice?) Classic Poldark lines \u201cWhy do you not go to London, mama?\u201d \u201cBecause if I did, who would see to Cornwall?\u201d Rightly said, Demelza. \u201cDo we not know a man with the needful skillage?\u201d An expression which surely deserves more frequent outings. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done that, Ladyship.\u201d Drake rediscovers the inner strength he had during the toad-finding days. (Remember \u2018e they?) \u201cWhat possible use could you be in a carriage with your wife and a pug?\u201d Best line of the entire series? Or best line in any TV drama ever? I\u2019m torn. Regulation reverse sexism bare chest moment My eyesight has been so irreparably damaged by the mind-scrambling chest sightings witnessed in series one that it appears I failed to spot a pectoral glimpse faithfully reported by eagle-eyed \u2019Darkers on last week\u2019s episode. Many noted this below the line and a reader wrote to me from the Netherlands to berate me about this failure (I am not joking). I can only apologise. This week, though, it was back to business as usual. Which is to say no business at all. Next week Someone is stealing from the mine. Ned is in severe trouble. And Sir Evil George is back doing what he does best: marrying a woman who doesn\u2019t want to get married to him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
