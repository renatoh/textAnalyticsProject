Brazilian hip-hop has long been a movement associated with the left. Last year, the great and good of Brazilian rap launched a last-ditch attempt to avert the election of the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, with a manifesto denouncing him as an authoritarian \u201cwretch\u201d who threatened Brazil\u2019s poor, black and LGBT communities. \u201cHe\u2019s not on your side, he\u2019s not on my side, he\u2019s not on our side,\u201d the Rio rapper BNeg\u00e3o declared at the time. But as Latin America\u2019s largest democracy careens into a new era of conservatism, it is rightist rappers such as Alves who are providing the soundtrack. \u201cBeing progressive is mainstream \u2026 We\u2019re anti-establishment,\u201d proclaimed Alves, one half of the duo Mensageiros da Profecia (Messengers of the Prophecy). Many of Brazil\u2019s rightist rappers are unblushing cheerleaders for Bolsonarismo. Their recordings feature samples of their president\u2019s incendiary speeches, lyrics exalting dictatorship-era generals and torturers such as Carlos Alberto Brilhante Ustra, and shout-outs to Bolsonaro\u2019s US-based guru, Olavo de Carvalho. Luiz, O Visitante \u2013 a Recife-based MC considered the movement\u2019s godfather \u2013 has a track called My Son Will Be a Bolsonarista in which an expectant father savages Brazil\u2019s leftist Workers\u2019 party (PT) and plots a far-right future for his child. \u201cWhen my son is born he\u2019ll follow his dad\u2019s footsteps. His first words will be: \u2018PT never again!\u2019\u201d he raps. \u201cHe\u2019ll dress up like Ustra and be a fan of Bolsonaro. When he\u2019s at school with his mates, he\u2019ll be an oppressive motherfucker.\u201d The Belo Horizonte rapper PapaMike is another diehard Bolsonarista, with songs such as \u201cA Letter to Bolsonaro\u201d that deride the president\u2019s opponents as \u201ccokeheads and stoners\u201d and lionize Bolsonaro as a rifle-toting saviour. Other conservative MCs bash \u201cleftard\u201d journalists and politicians bent on \u201ccommunizing\u201d Brazil while they champion causes close to Bolsonaro\u2019s heart, such as burgeoning Brazil-Israel ties, and the 1964-1985 dictatorship. Alves, a thoughtful and softly spoken 30-year-old, is more circumspect about Brazil\u2019s new leader, rejecting the label Bolsonarista despite having voted for him in both rounds of last year\u2019s election. \u201cI don\u2019t feel any warmth towards Bolsonaro on a personal level. I don\u2019t like him,\u201d the rapper explained during an interview at the group\u2019s studio in Jardim Capelinha, a low-income community in south S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cI\u2019d sit down for a beer with [the former leftist president] Lula and there\u2019s no way I\u2019d do that with Bolsonaro. But his agenda contains many of the values that I believe in.\u201d Those values include being anti-abortion, pro-police, pro-God and pro-gun \u2013 beliefs the evangelical rapper claimed now define the deprived urban periphery where he grew up. Alves attributed his \u201cunquestionable\u201d support for the right to bear arms for self-defense to the bullet-riddled corpses he saw near his boyhood home in what was then known as S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s \u201ctri\u00e2ngulo da morte\u201d (murder triangle). \u201cThe lefties of Vila Madalena [S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s answer to Islington or Brooklyn \u201cchampagne socialists\u201d] don\u2019t get this. They\u2019ve never seen a body splayed out on the ground,\u201d he sniffed. \u201cIf they\u2019ve ever seen a coffin it\u2019s because their dog died \u2013 or their grandad of old age.\u201d Alves \u2013 whose group released a rightwing rap anthem called Rap de Direita to celebrate Bolsonaro\u2019s triumph - said that, unlike many observers, he had foreseen the result. He believed Brazil\u2019s left obsessed over \u201csecondary issues\u201d such as transgender bathrooms rather than the topics most voters cared about, such as crime and healthcare. \u201cHe\u2019s extremely boorish and all the rest of it,\u201d Alves said of Bolsonaro. \u201cBut he spoke to the clamour of the people. While the [other] rappers were going around talking about police violence, the main concern of your average slum dweller \u2026 wasn\u2019t police violence. Actually, he wanted more police on the beat \u2026 so nobody would nick his phone.\u201d For all that, Alves and his break-dancing band-mate, Felipe Ara\u00fajo, admitted feeling anxious about Bolsonaro\u2019s unfocused leadership style, troubled by the radicalism of some supporters and unimpressed by the president\u2019s rowdy behaviour on social media. \u201cI was watching Bolsonaro on the TV recently \u2026 and I said: \u2018Dude, we\u2019ve elected a meme,\u2019\u201d Alves added. \u201cBut that was what was on offer, you know?\u201d Ara\u00fajo, 31, said he was unsure how Brazil\u2019s right turn would turn out but vowed to chronicle the Bolsonaro presidency \u2013 warts and all \u2013 in his songs. \u201cWe will portray any screw-ups he makes in our music. We will challenge him. That\u2019s our role as rappers,\u201d he said. Despite Brazil\u2019s conservative tack, the musicians said rightwing rap remained a niche market and represented a tiny slice of the hip-hop movement, which remains largely hostile to Bolsonaro. \u201cIt\u2019s like 1%,\u201d admitted Alves, who is plotting a new album narrating Brazil\u2019s new political era called The Politically Incorrect Guide to Hip-Hop. But Alves \u2013 whose Maga cap was a gift from members of the rightwing group Movimento Brasil Livre \u2013 said he suspected many Brazilian rappers were closet conservatives. \u201cThey\u2019re afraid of the media \u2013 of getting dissed,\u201d he claimed. \u201cBecause being rightwing - it\u2019s not cool, you know?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
