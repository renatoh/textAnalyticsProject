Fortunately, that was only when he was lying by the pool reading George Best's autobiography. But when he abandoned the book, it was to reflect that his own international career was not exactly going to plan either. Johnson spent the night before the match fearing the worst. He had not played in England's first two warm-up matches and did not dare to imagine that he would figure in the last one before the first Test. Last night, his perpetually broad grin told that his first taste of senior international cricket could not have begun more spectacularly. Six years after he was forced to withdraw from an England tour of South Africa because of a serious back injury, Johnson finally had his opportunity. Three wickets in his first eight balls was quite a way to start. His fast-bowling rivals, Jimmy Ormond and Matthew Hoggard, had flogged themselves on two benign Indian pitches, but when Johnson's chance came, it was on surely the liveliest pitch that England will encounter this side of Christmas. Close-cropped and swarthy, with a slightly hunched, athletic approach, he had a breeze. With the third ball of his first over he produced a perfect outswinger that Vinayak Mane nicked to the wicketkeeper. His fifth delivery he ranked as one of the most memorable of his life, hinting at outswing then nipping back to bowl Yere Goud: India A nought for two. From the second ball of his next over, the left-handed Gautam Gambhir was lbw to an inswinger. When Andrew Flintoff then removed a third batsman without scoring, Rashmi Parida, India A were eight for four in the fourth over of the morning, and England were ready to propose that the Sawai Mansingh stadium, the prim, painted lady of Indian grounds, neatly attired in pink and terracotta, should host the entire series. \"I only knew I was playing when Nasser told me at the ground this morning,\" Johnson said. \"It was nice to get the England shirt on. The ball swung early and it did quite a bit. I've not bowled for the last two months so I'm still trying to secure my best rhythm, but it will do for a start.\" Johnson's first incarnation was as an aggressive back-of-a-length bowler, much in the mould of his Middlesex colleague Angus Fraser. His back injury set him back for several seasons, but a move to Somerset, specifically to work with their coach Kevin Shine, has revitalised him. He now routinely pitches the ball up and gives it a chance to swing. Yesterday, it did. Hussain will have been just as delighted with Flintoff. With a soft ball after lunch, he summoned a spell of two for 24 in eight overs that ensured India A's recovery did not become dangerously prolonged. Parida and Gagan Khoda were both unhinged by pace, Khoda out for 64 as he jabbed down late on a ball that scuttled through to remove his off-stump. The chief resistance came from Abhijit Kale, a stumpy batsman with hints of Gundappa Viswanath, and whose 122 in 4 hours represented more than half of India A's 233 for nine declared. Kale preyed on the more injury-vulnerable members of England's attack, carving Craig White and clipping Ashley Giles, and reaching his 100 by slog-sweeping Richard Dawson over square leg for six. However rusty Giles felt on his return from an achilles operation, a return of one for 48 from 17 overs was a solid return. If he was ready to be picked, it was only because he had been forced like early-spring rhubarb. With Martyn Ball ruled unfit shortly before the start because of a damaged left finger, Giles's return to the spin-bowling ranks was imperative. Hussain will ponder long and hard how to assess Johnson's performance. How much credence does he give a three-wicket display achieved in conditions that, even in Mohali, where quick bowlers occasionally gain encouragement, are unlikely to be encountered again? Hussain also won his third successive toss, all of them achieved in warm-up matches, after endless failures in Tests. It will never last.
