US stocks rebounded more than 11% in the afternoon in their best such showing since 1933 on signs that lawmakers and the Trump administration are nearing a deal on a $2tn stimulus package aimed at curbing economic distress caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The historic rally came a day after stocks recorded a record fall and Pelosi on Tuesday afternoon telling CNBC there is \u201creal optimism\u201d in Congress over a stimulus deal being reached. \u201cWe think the bill has moved sufficiently to the side of workers,\u201d she said. The US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, had told reporters on Capitol Hill, just before midnight on Monday: \u201cI think we\u2019ve made a lot of progress. There\u2019s still a couple of open issues, but I think we\u2019re very hopeful that this can be closed out [on Tuesday].\u201d Mnuchin said he and the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, had consulted the president and Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, on the details of the deal, which is believed to secure around $2tn in aid for workers and businesses. But the president took aim at Pelosi, who had introduced House Democrats\u2019 own $2.5tn stimulus plan overnight in an attempt to shape negotiations. In a late-night tweet, Trump accused Pelosi of seeking to derail a Republican-sponsored Senate bill. Republicans criticized Pelosi\u2019s rival bill as a wishlist, saying it included politically charged spending add-ons and regulations on federal elections, minimum wage, union regulations and climate change. Democrats made similar charges about the Republican Senate bill. Trump tweeted: \u201cRepublicans had a deal until Nancy Pelosi rode into town from her extended vacation. The Democrats want the Virus to win? They are asking for things that have nothing to do with our great workers or companies. They want Open Borders &amp; Green New Deal. Republicans shouldn\u2019t agree!\u201d The president returned to the attack on Tuesday morning. He tweeted: \u201cThis is not about the ridiculous Green New Deal. It is about putting our great workers and companies BACK TO WORK!\u201d He reiterated the message in a town hall-style live Q&amp;A on Fox News on Tuesday afternoon. At the same time, Trump was under fire from health experts for signaling in a lengthy press conference on Monday night that he could soon reopen the country for business. The US is just over one week into a 15-day self-quarantine and social-distancing initiative aimed at slowing transmission of Covid-19. Trump\u2019s lack of commitment to following expert advice appears to be creating stress within the coronavirus taskforce. Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has contradicted Trump at White House briefings and given interviews containing measured criticism of the president. Fauci was notably absent from the podium on Monday. Later on Monday night, a former Food and Drug Administration commissioner who served under Trump said opening America up for business too hastily could undo any progress that has been made to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d of infections and prevent the healthcare system from becoming overwhelmed. Scott Gottlieb tweeted: \u201cThere\u2019s a strong and understandable desire to return to better times and a functioning economy. \u201cBut it should not be lost on anyone that there\u2019s no such thing as a functioning economy and society so long as Covid-19 continues to spread uncontrolled in our biggest cities.\u201d On Tuesday, Trump tweeted that although \u201cthe world market for face masks and ventilators is crazy\u201d, his administration was \u201chelping the states to get equipment\u201d and had \u201cjust got 400 Ventilators for [New York mayor] Bill de Blasio. Work beginning on 4 hospitals in New York! Millions of different type items coming!\u201d New York\u2019 governor, Andrew Cuomo, said he communicated to the White House his state\u2019s immediate need for 30,000 ventilators and other protective medical equipment and \u201cthere has been no response\u201d. Cuomo warned at a press conference on Tuesday morning that New York\u2019s peak for the coronavirus crisis would be in the next 14 to 21 days and that other states should take heed. He urged the Trump administration aggressively to use the Defense Production Act to activate private industry to help provide medical resources. \u201cI understand the federal government\u2019s point that many companies have come forward and say we want to help,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have the ventilators in 14 days it does us no good. The federal Defense [Production] Act can actually help companies \u2026 Only the federal government has that power. And not to exercise that power is inexplicable to me.\u201d Cuomo also said that the number of cases in New York is greater than other large states. \u201cNew York has 25,000 cases. It has 10 times the problems that California has. It has 10 times the cases that Washington state has,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cWe need the federal help and we need the federal help now. What happens to New York is going to wind up happening to California and Washington state and Illinois. It is just happening to us first.\u201d Trump later blamed Cuomo for not ordering thousands of ventilators \u201ctwo years ago\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
