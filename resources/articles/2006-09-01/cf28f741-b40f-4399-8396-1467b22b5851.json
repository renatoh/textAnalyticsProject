Senior government figures are threatening to make the contest a bitter referendum on Brown's personal integrity after last week's vicious bout of infighting. They spent Friday discussing their choice of candidate and the mechanics of a bid after concluding they could no longer support him. This follows a serious breakdown between the two rival camps, culminating, according to one very close confidant of Tony Blair, in the Prime Minister telling friends: 'I have never known how mendacious he [Gordon] was, how full of mendacity.' Cabinet ministers spoke to The Observer before Blair's warning yesterday to both sides to suspend their damaging personal attacks - in which he also surprisingly let slip that he expected the next election to be in 2009. The Prime Minister also condemned the 'irredeemably old-fashioned' politics of MPs plotting against him and called for openness in debating Labour's future. This was seen as a signal that discussion will not be repressed by what Charles Clarke called Brown's 'control freak' instincts. The Chancellor will respond bullishly today, using an interview with BBC1's Sunday AM to say he will welcome an 'inclusive debate' and promise a cabinet of 'all the talents'. He will suggest Clarke could once again return to high office and deny any involvement in the plotting against Blair. However, it emerged last night that Tom Watson, the minister who signed a letter demanding Blair clarify his departure date, visited Browns' Scottish home last Monday. Watson said he was visiting their new baby, but further evidence of what was already known to be a close relationship will fuel suspicions. The cabinet source said while they had not chosen a rival candidate yet, the last week had tipped the balance to someone of 'credibility and stature' standing against Brown. Alan Johnson, Alan Milburn, John Reid and Charles Clarke are potential names. 'Until the beginning of this week, most of us would have ended up supporting him [Brown] because there wasn't anyone else,' said a source involved in the discussions. 'Now almost for sure, because of his behaviour, there will be a serious challenge from someone within cabinet and he's only got himself to blame.' Asked how many of the cabinet would back such a candidate, the minister said: 'Now, I think half a dozen, but I think it could be more like 10 [when a candidate is picked]. This week has been the cathartic moment. It's not about policy: the question is who has the character, the personal qualities. Gordon is his own worst enemy.' Brown's behaviour showed he lacked the 'honesty, integrity and trustworthiness' required, the source added. While declining to name those who would be willing to back an anti-Brown candidate, those with most to lose under Brown include John Reid, Hilary Armstrong, John Hutton, Lord Falconer and Hazel Blears. The Prime Minister is not now expected to publicly bless Brown's candidacy, and a senior minister said even a repeat of previous glowing testimonials were now out: 'He will describe him as having made an immense contribution, because he has, but I'm afraid that events of this week have changed things fundamentally and for ever. We have underestimated the extent to which he was prepared to bring the house down in pursuit of his own personal ambitions.' Brown's allies will, however, be reassured by an Ipsos/MORI poll for The Observer which found voters rated him more trustworthy, having better judgment and as more down-to-earth than most politicians, including Blair. Brown told the News of the World last night it was 'nonsense' to say that he egged on the revolt, and suggested that his critics were motivated by old disputes. He added that any Chancellor 'is in the difficult position of having to tell his colleagues \"no\" '. Blair yesterday demanded an end to the bloodletting, telling the annual Progress think-tank conference in London: 'We are not going to win if we have personal attacks by anybody on anyone, because it turns the public off.' However he added that Labour must not become 'defensive' about ideas after he had gone, and must be 'unafraid' of reaching out to the public. If there are further public attacks on Brown, a delegation of Labour MPs is said to be prepared to go to Downing Street this week to demand that Blair quit. Downing Street sources stressed Blair had phoned ministers and friends yesterday to demand self-restraint."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
