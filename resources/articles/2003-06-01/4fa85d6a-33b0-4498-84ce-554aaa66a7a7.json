Bouncing around on the back of a camel in the Arabian desert, or venturing across the polar icecap on a sled towed by a pack of yelping huskies are two that spring to mind. I am told the mosquitoes can be pretty fierce in the Amazon jungle and the M25 can be gruesome on a Friday afternoon. But 24 hours or so on a plane is a dreadful experience, as all who have made the trip would surely agree. So the England rugby squad have my sympathy today as they head south for the trip which may or may not underline claims being made that Clive Woodward's team are the best in the world. A John Grisham novel can kill an hour or two and there's the chance to catch up on all those films which never quite prompted a visit to the cinema. Then comes the tricky decision to be made about whether to make a Rod Marsh-David Boon-style assault on the aeroplane booze stocks. All are options but the one certainty is that you will arrive at the other end feeling as though you have been put through the mangle, uncertain as to what day it is and finding those immigration and customs cards a more than searching intellectual test. If that is not bad enough, consider that about half of Woodward's 37-strong rugby elite had to force weary bodies through the play-offs on a sweltering day at Twickenham on Saturday. At the end of a long season, irrespective of whether you believe the play-offs are a good thing (personally I don't), these matches must have seemed one big physical effort too many for some of the players. And now we expect them to raise their games again for the forthcoming Tests against New Zealand and Australia on June 14 and 21. Olympic athletes, who know more than most about peaking at the right time, have their pre-games schedules planned to the minutest detail. It is no coincidence that Paula Radcliffe, now the world's No1 female distance runner, is also the best prepared. She hopes to take the Olympic gold medal in the marathon next summer but is unlikely to put her body through the competitive demands of the race until Athens. By contrast England's top rugby players seem to face the equivalent of a marathon every other week. \"It is too much to expect, especially for the forwards,\" says Damian Hopley, once an England international of some repute and now chief executive of the Professional Rugby Players' Association. \"The gladiatorial nature of modern professional rugby takes a physical toll. I compare our game with the NFL in the United States, where they have a five-month season. \"There isn't a proper structure to the fixture list in rugby; it's a shambles. First the international matches are worked out, then the European programme, while the domestic matches come in piecemeal behind that. The public won't accept a season that lasts 41 weeks. Often it seems players don't really know what competition they are playing in, so goodness knows what the public thinks.\" Hopley says that he knows first hand that a number of England squad players are saying privately that they are close to burn-out. His argument is that any player should have a 16-week break from the sport, something which seems impossible as the demands of club and international rugby dictate that leading players are now closer than ever to a 12-month season. \"The entire structure of the season needs to be tweaked,\" he argues. \"There are problems which have developed because of the move towards professionalism and it is vital that administrators pay more attention to the needs of the players. If the playing side is right, then the rest will follow. \"As things are, the shelf life for an international rugby player is dwindling and it really is up to the sport to decide this is wrong. \"Players are being patched up when they get injured, and there may be the temptation to resort to performance-enhancing drugs. I hope that is never a problem in rugby. Drug testing is strict and I believe that the players have too much integrity. But it is a worry.\" Woodward, the England head coach, has taken the decision to fly out his strongest possible team, which some might see as a questionable step. After all, with the World Cup approaching, why lay all your cards on the table against your most dangerous opponents? Australia have had their share of injury worries but New Zealand, by common consent, are showing signs of putting together a side who could prove intimidating on home turf. Defeat now for England, I would argue, might leave damaging psychological scars which could have serious implications for the more serious skirmishes of the autumn. The former England captain Rob Andrew says Woodward is a man who has made mistakes but who has also shown a refreshing ability to learn from those setbacks and is determined to put right what he believes were inadequate preparations when the World Cup was held four years ago. \"I think Clive thinks the warm-up matches were not hard enough last time. They played some tune-up games against Premiership Select XVs and the United States, and they didn't prove much. This time he has decided to go for this in a big way. There are the matches against New Zealand and Australia, then Wales in Cardiff and fixtures home and away against France. It is his call, and those games show there is no intention of holding back. \"If it works out, then everybody will say great. If not, the critics will be lining up against him. He has picked his strongest available squad for the trip to New Zealand and Australia, and I think the players will be relishing the thought of proving themselves against the best southern hemisphere teams on their territory. If they had gone in there half-cock, with players being rested, those who went might have thought 'What is the point?' But that is not the case. \"The development of the professional game means that this is probably the strongest squad in depth that England have ever been able to send from this country. And there is now an awful lot riding on the outcome. \"This season Clive has managed to put the whole grand slam thing to bed, thankfully and you might say a little belatedly. Four years ago the World Cup came a little too soon but now here is a lot of experience in the England squad. They are ready to prove themselves a real force to be reckoned with.\" Let us hope so. With players resting aching limbs on the long journey today, I cannot help but wonder whether the scheduling of this short tour is awry and that a fair few might have benefited as much from a good holiday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
