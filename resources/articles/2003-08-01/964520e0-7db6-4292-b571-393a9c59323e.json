He finally flipped on the eve of the match when, with cameras and mini-discs whirling, he let rip with a few four-letter volleys which, expletives noisily deleted, made the news that evening. The R-word was back on the agenda after England achieved a record victory in Cardiff despite fielding none of the side that had accounted for Australia in Melbourne two months ago, but this time it was R as in resignation. \"I will not leave unless someone asks me to go,\" said Hansen, whose contract expires next May. \"My returning to New Zealand is not the answer to Wales's problems. I'm confident that I'm a good coach and I'm proud of the job I'm doing. This is not the time to roll into a ball and die. \"[The Welsh Rugby Union chief executive] David Moffett came to see me straight after the match and and was totally supportive and I believe I have the backing of all the players. I feel for our supporters because we were not good enough and they did not get their money's worth.\" If England's chariot was afire, Hansen was left, like his six immediate predecessors, looking at the smouldering remains of what was once one of rugby's strongest fortifications. The 10 consecutive defeats, a run that should be arrested on Wednesday when Wales take on Romania in Wrexham, have undermined his position. Since Tony Gray was sacked in 1988 after two 50-point defeats in New Zealand, no Wales coach has gone the distance. Nothing is worse to the Welsh than being caned by England, except when it is their reserves holding the stick. \"We have no excuses,\" said Wales's captain Stephen Jones. \"Our basic skills were poor and we let the nation down. Steve is getting flak but the players are 100% behind him. \"What the match showed was that England's league is head and shoulders above ours, something we all believe our new regional system will address.\" Hope is all Wales have left and as a currency it has less value than a Zimbabwean dollar. More than half the 60,000 crowd was supporting England and the Millennium Stadium is likely to be less than half full for the visit of Scotland on Saturday. Colin Charvis, one of two survivors from the ruins of Saturday, will lead Wales against the Scots. \"It's not my decision whether Steve stays or goes and it is not his,\" he said. \"If someone wants to remove him they will, but most of the players are happy to be under his command and believe in what he's doing.\" England have a better than 50% record against all their Six Nations rivals except Wales. The score stands at 49-49 with the next meeting between the sides likely to be in the World Cup quarter-final in Brisbane, when it should be a half-century for the men in white. England have passed 40 points in four of their past five matches against the Welsh, for whom it has become a case of three Rs: record reverses and resignations."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
