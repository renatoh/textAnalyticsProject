That puts a unique burden on those who do them. For the pharmaceutical companies that will have invested millions of pounds taking their product to the brink of the market, failure is disastrous. The incentive is to be as economical with the data as the rules allow. The results also create tough dilemmas for policymakers who have to make fine judgments about cost and benefit of one drug over another, and weigh the political uses of a drug that may be of limited benefit to the patient when it is the only treatment available. The row over antiviral drugs for treating flu raises all these questions. The usefulness of Tamiflu and its rival Relenza is a long-running debate. As we report, on Thursday the Cochrane collaboration, a group of independent scientists which investigates drug effectiveness, releases its meta-analysis of all the trials \u2013 rather than the partial evidence published by the industry. They found that in the normal outbreaks of flu the drug was designed to ease, it did not appear to do much good. It did not keep people out of hospital, and it did not help asthmatic children. The government has spent more than \u00a3500m stockpiling the drugs against a flu pandemic. On the face of it, that was a bad call. Only the politics of public reassurance \u2013 to have some kind of treatment rather than none \u2013 could justify it. But there is more to it than that. The man who advised the government during the 2009 flu pandemic, Professor Peter Openshaw, says antivirals did reduce the risk of illness and death. This is not evidence derived from randomised, double-blind clinical trials, but the professor argues that since flu viruses are becoming increasingly virulent, these drugs are clearly better than none. In a pandemic, pragmatism trumps all. The only way to resolve the argument is proper science. That means transforming clinical trials, harmonising the way they are carried out. It has happened with malaria drugs, and it is happening with HIV. The industry must allow access to their data. Confident that like is compared with like, trials can then be subjected to meta-analysis, allowing statisticians to drill down into sub-populations to establish when a drug performs most effectively. The protocols surrounding trials need to be streamlined so that in short-lived pandemics, where a huge cohort is suddenly available, they can be rapidly authorised, as the new director of the Wellcome Trust, Jeremy Farrar, suggested in the Guardian last month. Like all great science, it is an idea with the beauty of simplicity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
