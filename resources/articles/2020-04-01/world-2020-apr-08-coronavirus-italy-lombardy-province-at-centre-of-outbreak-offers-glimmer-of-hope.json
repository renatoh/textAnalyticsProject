The town was immediately put under lockdown, with 10 others across the province, which lies south of Milan, following suit the next day. Today, as calls to emergency lines return to pre-outbreak levels, Lodi is offering a glimmer of hope for how the rest of Italy might overcome the pandemic and make its way out of the lockdown. In recent weeks, the province, which has a population of about 230,000, has seen a sustained decline in the rate of new infections, with total cases by Monday reaching 2,278, a rise of 23 since Sunday. \u201cThe first few days were very brutal, characterised by a significant number of patients with breathing difficulties,\u201d said Stefano Paglia, the chief of the emergency unit at Codogno and Lodi city hospital. \u201cNow the situation is normalising, we still deal with some Covid-19 patients, but the situation has gone from one of maximum emergency to returning to more ordinary levels of management.\u201d Fabrizio Canevari, an operations manager at Soreu della Pianura, a safety and first aid service that manages calls to emergency numbers covering four Lombardy provinces, including Lodi, said: \u201cOn day three of the outbreak we had 2,300 calls, on Sunday there were 480, so we are returning to a relatively normal level of activity.\u201d The emergency unit at Codogno hospital was closed immediately after the first coronavirus case was detected, with services transferred to the hospital in Lodi city. Up until last week, the hospital had treated 1,700 Covid-19 patients, of whom 300 died. \u201cThere are positive signs in Lodi because the early lockdown blocked, or at least greatly limited, the circulation of the virus,\u201d said Walter Ricciardi, an adviser to the Italian health ministry on the coronavirus outbreak and a member of the World Health Organization. \u201cFor sure, there is less pressure now and for this reason the health services can manage a situation which in the early days could only be done with a great deal of effort, but I predict we\u2019ll still need several days before things completely return to normal.\u201d The province of Bergamo, north of Milan, suffered a similar fate to Lodi at the beginning of the outbreak, in that the virus was initially misdiagnosed at a hospital in the town of Alzano Lombardo, allowing it to spread to other patients and health workers. Although the first case in Bergamo was confirmed on 23 February, the province of 1.2 million people only went into lockdown with the rest of the Lombardy region on 8 March, during which time it quickly became Italy\u2019s \u201cground zero\u201d. As of Monday, there were 9,815 confirmed coronavirus cases across Bergamo province, while the death toll in March was 2,060, according to official figures. \u201cThere is also a trend of improvement in Bergamo but whereas Lodi is in an advanced stage of progress, Bergamo is still in the thick of the situation,\u201d added Ricciardi. Across Italy, the curve of new cases is flattening, with 1,941 new infections registered on Monday, the lowest day-to-day rise in a week. Italy\u2019s lockdown is currently due to expire on 13 April, however easing restrictions at this stage would be \u201cpremature\u201d, said Ricciardi. \u201cChina implemented measures for three months and had a plateau [of new infections] that continued for 20-25 days before it started to decrease,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re in the first month-and-a-half of the lockdown, so I think we still need to resist and wait for the curve to fall definitively.\u201d The Italian government is studying a combination of measures that would allow the country to gradually move towards easing the lockdown, including a system to test, trace and contain the virus. \u201cWe are assessing the technological solutions for testing and tracing and hope to do experiments over the next two weeks. The system should be ready by the end of the month, or early May,\u201d said Ricciardi. Italy\u2019s southern regions have so far managed to stave off a surge in infections. \u201cCases in the south are still going up but they are going up slowly,\u201d said Giorgio Sestili, a physicist who is collating studies from Italian scientists and sharing them on the Facebook page Coronavirus \u2013 Data and Scientific Analysis. \u201cHowever, the lockdown is still fundamental.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
