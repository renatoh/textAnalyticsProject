Needing one more win to reach the Wimbledon final, Andy Murray faced Andy Roddick, a man he had beaten six times out of eight, a man he had humbled on the same court four years before, when the Scot was 19. Here, surely, was Murray's golden chance to achieve something he had dreamed about since he was a child. And then it was taken away. \"I didn't want to watch the final after that, at all,\" Murray says as his mind drifts back to a semi-final that an inspired Roddick won in four desperately tight sets. Murray had a set point in the third-set tie-break that would have put him within one set of the final, but the American played one of the best matches of his life to dash hopes of a first British men's champion since Fred Perry in 1936. Murray is one of the most analytical players on the tour. Few players are willing to analyse the whys and wherefores as much as he does, especially after a defeat, and rather than point solely to that wasted opportunity in the third set, Murray says the key to everything had come much earlier on. \"I just know I should never have got broken in the first set. I think I was up 40-15 on my serve. Against someone like Roddick, who plays very well when he's ahead, against his big serve, it's very important not to have concentration lapses like that, which I maybe did at the end of that set.\" Not for the first time in his career, Murray was criticised in some quarters for being too passive, allowing Roddick to take the initiative at crucial times. But if he could turn back the clock, Murray would not necessarily change anything. \"That match came down to a couple of points and he got very lucky on one of them in the first tie-break,\" he says. \"I had a set point and he hit a volley that came off the throat and bounced short off one of my passes. It was a very lucky shot. It's tough to say I'd do it differently all over again because it was a couple of points here and there. And if that match wasn't the best tennis he's ever played then the next one definitely was.\" In that next match, the one Murray did not want to watch, Roddick played out of his skin and yet still lost to Roger Federer as the Swiss clinched his sixth title by winning an epic final set 16-14. It was one of the greatest Wimbledon finals, the match of the American's life and yet he lost. It took Roddick months to get over it. It is a feeling that Murray knows only too well. At the Australian Open in January he played the most impressive tennis of his life to reach his second grand-slam final, 16 months after his first, at the US Open. In New York, Federer had taught him a lesson at the highest level. This time everything suggested it would be different but once more, the Swiss produced when it mattered, leaving Murray mentally shattered. \"It was incredibly disappointing,\" he admits. \"It was difficult for me to lose because I thought I was going to win.\" There is no shame in losing to a man who has a record 16 grand-slam titles, but an emotional Murray shed a few tears on the courtafterwards and clearly suffered something of a let-down over the next few months as his game and his motivation dipped. \"I don't know if it hurt me really, really badly, because I knew that I gave it everything I had,\" Murray says. \"It's not just those two weeks, it's everything that goes into it beforehand, [the work in] December and January in the build-up. Maybe it was the end of that stretch for me that was very tough to take emotionally and maybe just a bit of a release because it was a very difficult few months.\" Five months on, Murray appears to have his motivation back. Though his recent form has not been as good as he would like, he will go into Wimbledon knowing that he is one of the few players who truly believe they can win the title. His former coach Brad Gilbert says he would like to see Murray use his service returns \u2013 probably the best part of his game \u2013 more effectively, perhaps following some of them to the net. But his style of play is well-suited to the grass courts and having pledged to build his year around the grand slam events, Murray is extremely well prepared physically and the events of last summer and this January may help him if he makes it through to the semi-finals, or further. When he reached his first grand-slam final, he was still raw. In Australia, he looked ready. Now he feels his time is coming. \"Last year was the first year that I went into Wimbledon with a realistic chance of winning the tournament,\" he says. \"Maybe because of having had that expectation last year and coming close, that will help me this year. Last year I was ready physically. Mentally, I was pretty near. Now I do think I can still win. I hope I can do it, but it's going to be incredibly difficult because of the guys that are playing the game just now. And that's what's actually motivating. In a lot of ways it will make the achievement even more satisfying when it happens.\" As the lone star in a very bleak sky of British hopefuls, at least on the men's side, Murray knows that all eyes will be on him this year and probably every year for the rest of his career as he strives for that first grand-slam title. Like Tim Henman, who reserved his best tennis for Wimbledon, Murray generally plays well there and he seems able to cope with the pressure that comes from outside, while dealing well with the expectations he puts on himself. \"I don't think I'm ever going to come into Wimbledon again flying under the radar. But I don't feel like I'm that far away from playing great tennis again. I hope that it starts again at Wimbledon. A few years ago I was playing really bad when I went into Wimbledon, I think it was the year that I beat Roddick there, and I played very, very well. Every year since then has been good. So I think I'll play well, I just don't know how well yet.\" How well he will have to play is another matter. With Federer chasing a record-tying seventh Wimbledon crown, Rafael Nadal \u2013 in whose part of the draw the Scot finds himself \u2013 back to his best after a fifth French Open victory and Roddick believing he can go one better than last year, Murray knows he cannot get away with playing below his best. The recent form may not have been great, but the belief is undoubtedly there. \"I think I can do it,\" he says. \"I just need to make sure I'm as best prepared as possible, which I have been for most of the grand slams I've played. That's what I expect. If you don't expect to win one and then you get into that position you can get scared or you might be happy with a semi-final or a quarter-final. That's not really my mentality and all of the guys that I work with, we all believe that I can win the tournament but we all know that it takes a huge effort, physically and emotionally. They play a big part in it as well, because it's doing everything right.\" Team Murray \u2013 his coaches, physio and physical trainers \u2013 are not the only ones who will be cheering him on. He broke with his girlfriend, Kim Sears, last September, but they have reconciled and she will be alongside Murray's mother, Judy, at his matches and will help keep him grounded for the fortnight. He has always said that the week leading up to Wimbledon is the toughest of all, that when the tennis finally gets going it is easier to lose himself in the tournament itself. But the presence of his mother and girlfriend is absolutely vital, because even in a World Cup summer, Murray's every move and every grimace will be scrutinised to the nth degree. \"It's not just me \u2013 everybody involved in British tennis is very stressed out around this time, worrying about jobs and what people are going to write,\" Murray says. \"But there are so many things that are very, very relaxing as well. It's so nice to just to be at home. To have my friends round for dinner or to go go-karting or to just sit a home and watch TV and do your own thing \u2013 it can be the most relaxing tournament in a lot of ways, away from the court.\" Murray admits he has allowed his mind to wander, dreaming what his life would be like should he win a grand-slam title. The Scot is more complex than most, craving success but not necessarily the fame that comes with it. \"Of course I imagine what it would be like,\" he says. \"I'm sure there's a huge relief. [Winning] Wimbledon, I don't really want to think what would happen, because \u2026 I think it's life-changing. Maybe for someone from another country I'm sure it changes your life, but not in the same way that it would a Brit winning. It would be very difficult and something you would have to learn to live with, but I think I want to do it. \"I play tennis and I love it, but there are certain things that are difficult. I don't necessarily like the fame that goes with it and winning Wimbledon changes you from being a tennis player to being a huge, huge star. Like when I went from playing the Futures Tour to playing Wimbledon the first time it became quite stressful. Winning Wimbledon, times that by a hundred. It would be very challenging and a difficult thing to deal with, I'm sure.\" Life-changing? Yes. Difficult to cope with? Perhaps. Worth giving everything for? Definitely."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
