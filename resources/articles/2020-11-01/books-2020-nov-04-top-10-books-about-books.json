Not to be pretentious, but let\u2019s start with the book itself: it\u2019s a story, lived or imaginary, told with 26 letters, which make up sentences, pages, chapters \u2026 If you think about it, that\u2019s a pretty remarkable object in itself. In the physical sense, a pile of papers, but also a maze of feelings, emotions, actions. Stories and books are the foundations of our culture. Before we had paper, we had clay tablets. The only thing older than the book is the drawing, but that\u2019s a whole other tale \u2026 And then adding to that another book that lives within that book \u2013 a whole new maze! Novels create an illusion of life. Nothing about them is real, and yet, sometimes I have a feeling that something in my writing haunts me \u2013 not least because of the publishing process, which can be fraught. Every day, hundreds of books by unknown authors make their way to publishing houses around France. So many people write novels and dream of being published, but comparatively few make it. Ever since my first book deal for The Portrait, over 10 years ago, I\u2019ve observed the mysterious and fascinating world of publishing. \u201cWrite about what you know,\u201d they say, and so for a long time I\u2019ve planned to write a book about that world, about which stories are chosen to be published, how authors interact with their publishers and with their own books. And then, as The Readers\u2019 Room came together, I thought, what if you were one of the lucky few who has been published \u2026 and then you just disappear? You\u2019ve signed your contract, the book\u2019s about to come out \u2013 but you\u2019re nowhere to be found! Imagine the panic at the publishers! The following 10 books \u2013 nine novels and one work of nonfiction \u2013 offer, I think, an insight into the strange world of creating books, the bizarre job that is being a novelist and the magic that can exist (sometimes literally) within the books that we read. 1. The Dumas Club by Arturo Perez-Reverte One of Perez-Reverte\u2019s strangest stories. Book dealer Lucas Corso embarks on a mission to find a lost book, printed in Venice in the 16th century. But this book contains engravings that, following a certain ritual can, summon the devil. 2. Lila, Lila by Martin Suter My favourite of Suter\u2019s books. A shy young man finds a dead man\u2019s manuscript hidden in a cabinet in a market, and decides to pass it off as his own to impress the woman he loves. The novel is published and brings him huge success, but he is of course unable to write a second one. And then threatening letters start to arrive \u2013 from someone claiming to be the author. 3. A Ladder to the Sky by John Boyne In a hotel in Berlin, the young Maurice Swift happens to run into the famous novelist Erich Ackerman, who confides in him about his dark past. The unscrupulous Swift quickly appropriates Ackerman\u2019s life story \u2013 ruining him, but finally becoming the famous author he\u2019s always dreamed of being. Years later, Swift needs new sources of inspiration \u2026 It doesn\u2019t matter whose stories they are, or how he acquires them, so long as they continue to make his name. These stories will drive him to lie, steal and maybe even worse. 4. In Praise of Lies by Patricia Melo Under various American pseudonyms, Jose Guber shamelessly pitches classic plots to his clueless editor \u2013 but increasingly The Stranger and Crime and Punishment are turned down for their narrative weaknesses. Whilst desperately researching what he hopes will be his next bestseller, he meets the beautiful, married snake expert Melissa. They begin a passionate fling \u2013 but Melissa, convinced that Jose is a genius, has found the perfect man to plot the murder of her husband. 5. Death by Publication by Jean-Jacques Fiechter A quite extraordinary crime novel, featuring a particularly subtle literary vengeance. A distinguished publisher\u2019s friendship with one of his longest standing authors has been soured by envy, slights and betrayal. His Machiavellian revenge will convince the author that his latest prize-winning masterpiece is in fact a work of plagiarism. 6. The Surgeon of Crowthorne by Simon Winchester A true story. In the autumn of 1896, Dr James Murray, the celebrated editor of the Oxford English Dictionary, decides to visit a certain Dr Minor, who lives in Crowthorne in Berkshire, and who for years has been sending him helpful and beautifully written contributions to the dictionary. But quite a surprise awaits him: Dr Minor lives in Crowthorne \u2013 in Broadmoor Asylum, where he has been incarcerated for murder. 7. Flaubert\u2019s Parrot by Julian Barnes Geoffrey Braithwaite, a doctor obsessed with Gustave Flaubert, decides to make a pilgrimage to Normandy, the land of his idol. In Rouen, at the Flaubert museum, he is overcome with emotion to find the very parrot who inspired Loulou from the tale A Simple Heart. But at Croisset, Flaubert\u2019s home, there is yet another stuffed parrot. This is the real Loulou, confirms the curator. But which is the true Loulou? A novel filled with humour and unexpected encounters. 8. Hocus Bogus by \u00c9mile Ajar The novel in which Romain Gary explains the subterfuge that he arranged to allow him to twice win the Prix Goncourt, only supposed to be awarded to an author once, by writing La Vie Devant Soi under a pseudonym and enlisting the son of his cousin to appear as \u00c9mile Ajar. A fascinating and thought-provoking meditation about fiction and identity. 9. Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury Montag is a particular kind of fireman from the future: he burns books. Right up until the day when he decides to read a book instead of burning it, rejects the state-sanctioned happiness and dreams of a world where literature and imagination are not banned. Bradbury\u2019s greatest work. 10. The Shadow of the Wind by Carlos Ruiz Zaf\u00f3n A young boy enters the cemetery of lost books, a secret library in Barcelona, where he\u2019s given a book by an unknown author called Carax. Entranced by the book, he searches for more of Carax\u2019s work, and to find out more about the mysterious author. And then his path crosses that of a man who is also searching for books by Carax \u2013 but to burn them.
