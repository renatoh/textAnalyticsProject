Johnson, who turns 32 this month, failed to settle at Wakefield last season after previous stints with Warrington, Bradford and Wigan. He is the Welsh club's second new signing, following the former Bradford and Warrington wing Stuart Reardon, even though their plans to enter administration have yet to be accepted and a winding-up order has been deferred to Wednesday. Iestyn Harris, who has succeeded Brian Noble as coach, has also confirmed that the Crusaders have registered an interest in Joel Monaghan, the disgraced former Canberra and Australia centre who is looking for a move to the Super League next year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
