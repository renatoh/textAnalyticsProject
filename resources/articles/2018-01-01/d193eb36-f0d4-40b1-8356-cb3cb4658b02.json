The survey, conducted by the Australian Public Service Commission (APSC), revealed that 5% of of public servants reported witnessing corrupt behaviour in 2016-2017. That represents a significant increase from the 2.6% who witnessed corruption in 2013-14 and the 3.6% of respondents in 2014-15. Cronyism was by far the most common form of corruption witnessed, accounting for almost two-thirds of all responses last financial year. That was followed by nepotism (26%), and \u201cgreen-lighting\u201d (21%), a term for decisions that improperly favour a person or company, or disadvantage another. The APSC, in its annual state of the service report, has maintained that corruption remains rare in the federal public service. But it said action was needed to reduce corrupt behaviour. \u201cAs well as ensuring that corruption is eliminated, [Australian public service] leaders should focus on ensuring that employees are confident that if they report corruption it will be acted on appropriately,\u201d the report said. The findings have renewed calls for a federal anti-corruption body. Transparency International, an anti-corruption group, said the current environment discouraged public servants from speaking out against their colleagues. The president, Anthony Whealy, a former New South Wales supreme court judge, said the increase in reports of corruption was significant. He said it highlighted the need for an overarching anti-corruption body, which had responsibility for the whole public service. \u201cThere is a problem with the Australian public service and the commission and the code of conduct,\u201d Whealy told Guardian Australia. \u201cI think there is a genuine fear that people don\u2019t like to dob in their mates.\u201d \u201cThere are not adequate whistleblower protections and they would be afraid of the consequences for their employment.\u201d Whealy said he believed the real rate of corruption was far higher than that suggested in the report. The report also revealed a majority of those surveyed in 59 agencies believed they worked in a high corruption risk environment. It\u2019s the first time such a question has been asked. \u201cIt highlights that there\u2019s a possibility of an epidemic of corruption lying beneath the surface in some of these agencies,\u201d Whealy said. \u201cOverall, I think it\u2019s an interesting report, but it only highlights the need for an independent overarching, umbrella-type organisation that has the capacity to investigate more serious instances of corruption, as well as lower-level incidents.\u201d The commission\u2019s report found public servants were likely to report corruption. About three-quarters of employees who worked in high-risk environments said they would feel confident that their colleagues would report corruption. The number was 64% for low-risk environments."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
