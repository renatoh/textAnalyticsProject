Iraq announced earlier today that it would begin dismantling its Samoud 2 missiles in line with a demand from Hans Blix. Baghdad had been given until tomorrow to begin the destruction of the missiles, which Mr Blix judged to be in breach of the 150km limit imposed at the end of the 1991 Gulf war. Iraq had initially opposed the order, arguing that the missiles exceeded the limit only because they had been tested without warheads or guidance systems. Today, it appeared to give way. Saddam's scientific adviser, Lieutenant General Amer al-Saadi, asked Mr Blix to dispatch a technical team to discuss the \"framework and timetable\" for carrying out the order, while Mr Blix's top deputy, Demetrius Perricos, was already in Baghdad to discuss the issue. Mr Perricos was due to meet Iraqi officials early tomorrow for a technical discussion, with a view to commencing the destruction process the same day, inspectors' spokesman Hiro Ueki said today. He gave no details of the planned destruction. Speaking ahead of his security council report, Mr Blix today described the move as \"a very significant piece - a real disarmament\". Tony Blair, however, dismissed the offer as another one of Saddam's \"games\". Speaking at a news conference in Madrid, he said: \"The moment I heard ... that Saddam Hussein was saying he would not destroy the missiles was the moment that I knew later in the week that he would announce - just before Dr Blix reported - that he would indeed destroy these missiles. He never makes any concessions at all other than with the threat of force hanging over him.\" Russia gave the strongest indication yet that it may use its position as a permanent member of the security council to block a second UN resolution paving the way for military action against Iraq. The Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, said Russia is ready to veto the American and British resolution if necessary to preserve \"international stability\". Russia has backed an alternative memorandum promoted by France and Germany giving arms inspectors four more months to search for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. The French foreign minister, Dominique de Villepin, today hailed Iraq's decision to begin destroying its Samoud 2 missiles as confirmation that UN weapons inspections were working. \"We have all said that inspections cannot continue indefinitely,\" Mr de Villepin added. \"We are speaking today of several months.\" He refused to comment on the possibility that France could use its security council veto to block the US and UK resolution, but added: \"We are opposed to the proposal of a second resolution.\" Nine of 15 council members must back the resolution. Each of the five permanent members - China, France, Russia, the UK and the US - have the power of veto."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
