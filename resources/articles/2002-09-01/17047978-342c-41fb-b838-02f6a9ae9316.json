Where your work involves selling ideas or products that's a recipe for disaster. How can you hope to convince anyone to support your employer's aims if you're not impressed with them yourself? You need to examine whether it's the organisation or the nature of the work that's wrong for you. Campaigning for a cause takes resilience and an unshakeable belief in what you're doing. It's inevitable you'll meet resistance, no matter how established the people you work for. When you're asking others for something, you have to convince them of its value each time; you can't rely solely on the status of your employer to carry you through. Learning to cope with setbacks and rejection without taking things personally is essential. If you can't, this type of work could do you serious harm. Talk to colleagues about the problems you're having and find out their strategies for dealing with those who are rude or unhelpful. When you feel defeated by your job, it's useful to revisit what prompted you to apply for it in the first place. Think about what it would take to rekindle that initial enthusiasm. What is your reaction now to being responsible for improving their image, making them better known and promoting their vision? If you don't believe in them enough to want to do this, you should ask yourself why you're staying. irenek@lycos.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
