Even so, for a saxophonist to record a whole set with only bass and drums for accompaniment, even if they're Ron Carter and Billy Cobham, is a hazardous undertaking. But only occasionally did I get that feeling of being adrift and in need of a harmonic lifebelt. The best track is a version of 'My Funny Valentine', in which Harrison is supported by Carter's bass alone. The lyricism of the one and the alert sympathy of the other create a piece of rare beauty. John Pizzarelli Bossa Nova (Telarc CD-83591) If the words 'easy listening' didn't amount to a term of abuse, they would describe the art of John Pizzarelli to perfection. He plays the guitar with exquisite taste and control, sings quietly with a smile in his voice and only chooses the best material. When he decides to devote a CD to the bossa nova, and dedicates it to Jo\u00e3o Gilberto, he does the job properly, going so far as to sing a few numbers in Portuguese. Using his regular trio, he adds various guest artists, including the excellent Harry Allen on tenor saxophone, plus a string quartet and a quartet of flutes. Immaculately performed and produced, this is the kind of album to keep handy for when things get a bit much and you need a bit of - well - easy listening. John Coltrane A Love Supreme (Impulse 051 155-2) For those who saw Wednesday night's Imagine ... on BBC1, in which Alan Yentob investigated the Coltrane legacy, Universal has thoughtfully relaunched the CD of his greatest work. It's never been out of print and probably never will be. If you haven't already got it, this is the best edition of A Love Supreme to have: the original four parts as released in 1964, without alternative takes, breakdowns and other completist bits and pieces. Listened to properly, with full concentration, it can be a mind-filling experience."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
