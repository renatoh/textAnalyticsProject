On Friday morning Pell faced Melbourne magistrates court for a second time since being charged in June. The hearing was brief and dealt with administrative matters. Pell, 76, arrived at the court shortly after 9am on Friday flanked by police and was met by a media pack, some of whom had been waiting outside the court as early as 5am. Survivors of historical child sexual abuse also arrived early and waited for Pell holding placards. He was heckled as he made his way inside. However, the crowd was substantially smaller than when he first appeared before the court in July, when scenes of chaos unfolded as Pell was met by a pack that included international media. Pell sat in the front of the court as the magistrate determined which witnesses would be called to give evidence at the committal hearing and whether those witnesses could be cross-examined. Once the case goes to a committal hearing, the magistrate will decide if there is enough evidence for the case to go to trial in the Victorian county court. Details of the charges Pell is facing are yet to be revealed. Pell has strenuously denied the charges and will plead not guilty if he is committed to stand trial. Pell\u2019s barrister, Robert Richter QC, told the court the prosecution had put forward \u201can awful lot of witnesses, and prosecution must have a view as to why they need so many of them\u201d. About 50 witnesses are expected to be called. The magistrate told Richter that she would need \u201csome persuasion\u201d to allow the cross-examination of witnesses who were children at the time. Witnesses were not named and details of the evidence they might give were not outlined. Richter added that \u201cwe propose to demonstrate to Your Honour that what was alleged was impossible\u201d, though journalists have not been given a list of the charges and allegations. Pell is the Vatican\u2019s treasurer, as prefect of the secretariat for the economy. He is third in charge in the Vatican and is the most senior Catholic in the world to face court. The case will return to court on 5 March for a committal hearing that is expected to last four weeks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
