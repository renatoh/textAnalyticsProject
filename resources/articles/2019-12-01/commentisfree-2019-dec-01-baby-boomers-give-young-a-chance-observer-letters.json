Get the boomers onside\u201d, Comment). I cannot for the life of me understand why my peer group do not realise how lucky they were. I come from a working-class background, but I grew up with the closest we\u2019ve ever got to equal opportunities in education, grants for university, work available with strong unions that enabled us to have decent sickness and holiday pay. I inherited nothing but could afford to get on the property ladder. I have a pension that allows me to keep warm and eat. I have the health and wherewithal to help my children and enjoy my retirement. I actually heard an older lady tell me that we\u2019ll be all right out of the EU because we survived the war. I was too polite to point out that we didn\u2019t, it was our parents\u2019 generation. Our parents, who worked hard and elected governments that gave us the welfare state, more personal freedom to live the lives we chose. How can we not want that for our children and grandchildren? The country was broke in 1945 but investment and planning built thousands of homes and created work. Austerity doesn\u2019t work. Giving people a chance does. I am delighted to see the Labour party produce a manifesto that plans for the future, doesn\u2019t just chuck a bit of money as a sticking plaster over massive problems. All I hear is criticisms of politicians and I just want to scream, \u201cthen get involved\u201d. Read more, think about the long-term future. We have to stop thinking we know it all and listen to the younger generation. Surely they deserve the opportunities we had. Ours was the generation that preached love and acceptance; it\u2019s a shame we lost that warm generosity. Jan Cawser Ripley, Derbyshire The grand old Duke of York Kate Williams makes a key omission in her resum\u00e9 of Frederick, Duke of York, implying, in the context of the Andrew debacle, that his career ended in disgrace (\u201cPrince Andrew and the royal crisis \u2013 past scandals\u201d, Focus). Frederick was restored as commander-in-chief two years after the scandal involving him and his mistress Mary Anne Clarke. He was c-in-c across four decades, for which history has been kind to him, for resourcing Wellington\u2019s defeat of Napoleon and his reforms which gained him the title \u201cthe soldier\u2019s friend\u201d. He improved soldiers\u2019 pay and conditions, reformed leadership training and opened what was soon known as the Duke of York\u2019s Royal Military Asylum \u2013 today School, flourishing in Dover two centuries on \u2013 for the care and education of the sons and daughters of ordinary soldiers; I was one in the 1960s. Frederick died in 1827 with a high reputation, one the present title-holder might admire. Chris Crowcroft Elstree WD6 Dignity in childbirth Catherine Bennett is right to express horror at the failings at the Shrewsbury and Telford hospital trust that led to the deaths of babies and mothers (\u201cWhy is it so hard to allow mothers the kind of labour they really want?\u201d, Comment). However, she is unfair in her criticism of Sheila Kitzinger who was a distinguished childbirth educator. Even the most straightforward labour is usually intense and painful, but it does not have to be frightening. The Kitzinger message was simple yet subtle: mothers who are well attended by sympathetic midwives in calm surroundings (and in a setting equipped for every medical eventuality) are more likely to relax in labour and be able to listen to their bodies. This does not mean that birth is painless, but many women who are well supported can emerge from it psychologically intact. Of course, for some women a planned C-section will be the best choice for them and should be readily available. Maternity services are so overstretched now that women are being repelled at the doors of maternity units and often shuttle in distress between home and hospital waiting for a bed. There are not enough midwives, so the calm, patient, individual support they are trained to give is not available to all women. Postnatal wards are also so understaffed that women are often deprived of basic care for them and their babies, and lack the privacy and dignity they need to recover properly from the rigours of birth. It is no wonder that there is an epidemic of postnatal depression. In the 1980s women were attended at home daily for 10 days after birth, and this gave women confidence, and a good start. Margaret Jones Tiverton, Devon Vote was not in our name As you reported, the Society of Antiquaries of London sought to remove Hubert Chesshyre from its fellowship after he was found to have committed sexual offences (\u201cEducation charity in turmoil after vote to back sex abuser\u201d, News). At a meeting held to effect this, however, the resolution was voted down. As fellows of the society, we are appalled by this outcome. The society\u2019s governance structures meant that the vote had to be made in person on a weekday afternoon, and only 109 of more than 3,000 fellows were able to attend. The 76 fellows who voted against the resolution do not represent us or the values and behaviours of any organisation of which we would wish to be members. We support Chesshyre\u2019s victim, and we emphasise the absolute importance of placing survivors\u2019 needs at the centre of any such situation. We offer our heartfelt apologies, and emphasise our determination to reform and modernise the society\u2019s statutes and governance procedures.

Now they are contemptuous\u201d, Comment). He may not be aware but the early discussions about entry to the Common Market and, indeed, general elections of the period were often centred on issues such as the price of butter. \u201cHousewives\u201d were a demographic to be appealed to and were told to \u201cshop around\u201d to manage. Furthermore, the lack of in-depth discussion on today\u2019s issues is often the result of politicians being scared to argue with members of the public or challenge their assertions for fear of being vilified. The supposed democratisation of the media has a lot to answer for. Trevor Hopper Lewes, East Sussex Shedding light on Japan\u2019s war As an army veteran and Japanophile, it was with great interest that I read the article about the relationship of Mark Rylance with his grandad, and his experience of being a PoW of the Japanese during the Second World War (\u201cThe Japanese put grandad through hell\u2026 but I can\u2019t share his hatred\u201d, News). I am a regular visitor to Japan and on my two most recent trips decided to explore the controversial Yasukuni shrine. What I found, which doesn\u2019t excuse the brutality of the Japanese at the time of the internment of Mark\u2019s grandad, was an extraordinary eye-opener. The opening section of the shrine\u2019s museum shows in great detail the impact on Asia of western empire-building, resource-grabbing, people-exploiting, colonialist greed. It gave me a very different view of the background to the Japanese perspective, which led to the outbreak of hostilities with them. Trevor Skingle London SW2 Halloumi alert! The article on halloumi (\u201cWe love halloumi\u201d, Magazine) declares dramatically that supplies are running \u201cdangerously\u201d low. I\u2019m now very worried, distraught even; please let us know the nature of this peril. Paul Garrod Portsmouth"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
