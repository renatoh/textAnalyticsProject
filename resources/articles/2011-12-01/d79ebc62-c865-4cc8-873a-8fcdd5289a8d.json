That name being the Doctor: he who, the Scriptures of Moffat say, brings salvation wherever he goes \u2013 transforming the lives of whoever he meets through kindness and sacrifice. Ridiculous? Well, maybe, but such an analogy, for me at least, has always seemed perfectly apt \u2013 not only in the context of the show or as a fan, but as an example of what is a wider social shift. That is: heroes of popular culture becoming modern figures of worship. This is a personal case, obviously. I'm not a religious man: I don't pray, don't go to church. I don't even believe in God. Yet I've always admired Doctor Who; not only for its values of intellect and empathy, but also for its often overlooked ability to explore deistic themes \u2013 both in the show and through the ardent devotion of fans. The Doctor, of course, isn't marketed outright as a messianic figure but it's all there: \"the lonely god\", more of an idea than a man, who resurrects himself in a crucifix position; who has, literally, defeated the devil, resisted temptation and forgiven his greatest enemy; \"he's like fire and ice and rage\", it was once said. \"He's like the night and the storm in the heart of the sun. He's ancient and forever. He burns at the centre of time and can see the turn of the universe. And \u2026 he's wonderful.\" Even the main premise of the show is built upon the concept of existential salvation: the idea that one day this wonderful being will drop out of the sky to rescue us from the crippling tedium of adult life, to make us believe that there is more to existence than work, bills and over-thinking popular tea-time television shows. The most obvious imagery comes under Russell T Davies's tenure as head writer, with one scene \u2013 where our hero is raised up by robotic angels \u2013 proving so garish that Christian Voice complained. Yet Davies is an atheist, whose aim was to project not just what people wanted in a God on to the Doctor, but also the problems and practicalities that come with it (Steven Moffat has also carried this on with episodes such as The God Complex). The Doctor is presented as fallible, and he needs us just as much as we need him. We make him better, keep his power in check and continue to astound him with our capacity for curiosity and kindness. It's a symbiotic relationship \u2013 one that we can see, understand and relate to far more than a faceless, questionable deity. You may scoff, but if atheism functions on the idea that the Bible is a work of fiction, then what's to stop us from taking our values from other works of fiction? David Cameron has called for a \"return to Christian values\", but it doesn't matter whose or what values we live by as long as they're good. With church attendance falling and spiritual indifference on the rise, organised religion in the UK is faltering under the weight of irrelevance and our icons, whoever they may be, have moved on. In Neil Gaiman's book, American Gods, the one-time Who writer plays upon this modern shift by depicting a world in which our worship of certain things \u2013 the internet, gambling, TV \u2013 take on the physical form of gods themselves, while the gods of old begin to die as faith in them dwindles. Popular culture, from Aslan to Robocop, has always dabbled in religious allegory. Fervent fans have always bound their identity to a certain cause, but it's only in the modern age that it's become quasi-religious. In the early 90s a friend of mine, once a devout Catholic, turned her back on God for Morrissey. Within a year of her epiphany (which was in a car, on the way to Glastonbury), images of Jesus in her house were replaced by framed photos of another; her weekly visits to church were replaced by a new house of worship, the monthly Smiths disco in Manchester (the hymns are better, apparently). Is this the same as switching from one religion to another? She believes she has simply converted from a silent idol who never answered her prayers, to one whose sermons spoke to her in ways she had never known before. A void had been filled. And that's just it, isn't it? In the absence of an interventionist God, people simply make their own. After all, when presented with such an abyss, you fill it with whatever you can. Even if that does happen to mean someone who now thinks bow-ties are cool."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
