Nevertheless, if you are unfamiliar with this unhinged Macy's balloon, he is currently the Republican frontrunner in the 2012 presidential race. That is, until one of them pipes up with some new big idea \u2013 like reducing American dependence on foreign energy by replacing the electric chair with one that runs on solar power. But Newt works tirelessly to keep the American dream alive. And that American's name is Newt Gingrich. And he has always dreamed big. No matter which woman's bed he woke up in. Just ask him. Apparently, he helped develop supply-side economics. And he toppled communism. I think he performed my first pap smear! And if that isn't impressive enough, he also has the uncanny ability to root out corporate cash like a truffle pig. But he realises most aren't blessed with his brilliance and so, as a gift to those who amble through life as mere lower-class mortals, Newt has proposed a fresh new Oliver Twist to solve the problem poverty in America and create jobs: remove the oppressive child labor laws, which he called \"truly stupid\" and put poor children to work. Yes, this flaming Fagin actually suggested: These schools should get rid of unionised janitors, have one master janitor, pay local students to take care of the school. You see, in his tireless work with the poor, Newt has observed, \"Really poor children, in really poor neighborhoods have no habits, no one around them works.\" He has a point. Just look at the amazing \"habits\" we have witnessed from really rich kids, in really rich neighborhoods, when no one around them works. Paris Hilton had to work very hard to make her porn video seem amateur. And those Kardashians? Their fame lust took years of dedication to hone. But to be fair, he did later clarify his statement: Kids shouldn't work in coal mines, kids shouldn't work in heavy industry. Ohhhh. OK. They should mop the bathrooms of the coalmines. That sounds much better. Nice to see someone is thinking outside the sand box. Poor kids could learn from you, Newt. Maybe, you could invest some of that job-creating Bush tax break money in a factory \u2013 so poor kids could open a factory and make their own latchkeys? Or, at the very least, just keep imparting your wisdom. Maybe, your next book could be: \"Your Starter Wife: Knowing When to Trade Up.\" Or: \"All You Need is a Bike to Start Influence Peddling Today!\" Please, sir, we want some more."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
