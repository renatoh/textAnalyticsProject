The studio lights go down. A hush descends. And then - whoosh! - suddenly a huge roar erupts as the Fiver, sporting a spectacularly poor toupee, enters the stage, trips over its chin, and stutters those immortal words: \"Ladies and gentleman, it's time to play Bruce Grobbelaar's Play Your Cards Right! And tonight's star prize - \u00a385,000 worth of damages!\" Now Brucie's been here before, hasn't he ladies and gentlemen? In 1997 he was cleared of match fixing and awarded \u00a385,000 damages from the Sun newspaper. But in January 2000, the appeal court pressed the 'e-uughh' buzzer - overturning the jury's verdict, stripping Brucie of his damages and leaving him facing financial ruin from a \u00a31m legal bill. Oh dear, oh dear. But Brucie was still smiling as he went to the House of Lords today. Because, as we all know, it could still be a good night if he played his cards right. So how did it go? HIGHER, HIGHER! Four of the five law lords reinstated the High Court jury's verdict that the Sun had libelled him by claiming he took \"bungs\" for match fixing. But wait one second! LOWER, LOWER! The law lords then slashed his \u00a385,000 damages award to just \u00a31! Is it because you get nothing for a pair [of defeats] - not in this game? Sadly no. The judges ruled that though match fixing hadn't been proven, Grobbelaar had acted corruptly by accepting bribes. \"He acted in a way in which no decent or honest footballer would act and in a way which could, if not exposed and stamped on, undermine the integrity of a game which earns the loyalty and support of millions,\" smiled luscious Lord Bingham, administering the legal kiss of death. And you can't get much LOWER than that. * * * * * * * * * * * THE TAYLOR RETORT When the Old Testament Israelites wanted to make themselves feel better, they'd get a flea-bitten goat and send it out into the wilderness, symbolically laden with their sins, to be destroyed. Tony Cottee has done much the same thing for Leicester City with Peter Taylor. \"You don't have to be a very good judge to see where all the problems started and ended,\" intoned Tone, pointing a big flashing pointy thing that said \"It's all Peter Taylor's fault\" at Peter Taylor's head. \"The buck always has to stop with the manager.\" Which was precisely the problem. With Taylor, the bucks never stopped. It was always a case of Leics is more. But the future England manager wasn't going to take that. \"It is very disappointing when you read comments from people like Tony Cottee basically saying what is happening is all down to me, that it is all my fault,\" bleated the man once known as the Caretaker. \"It is easy for Tony to say that,\" Pete stammered. \"And he should know from his own short spell as a manager at Barnet, from whom he is getting the blame for their demise, that things aren't easy.\" Ooh touch\u00e9! \"I can hold my hand up for certain things and I will always get stick for signing Ade Akinbiyi [for \u00a35m] and that move not working out. But a few people should be holding their hands up.\" Step forward Taylor signings Dennis Wise, Matthew Jones, Dennis Wise, Trevor Benjamin, Dennis Wise... So why exactly have Leicester been placed into administration? \"It was the cost of the stadium and having no Premiership money anymore,\" he said. And whose fault is it that Leicester don't have any Premierhsip money? Ah yes, Taylor, that'll be yours too. * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"We don't want to count our chickens but I hope we can do the same against Kiev\" - Rir Sobby Bobson salivates over the next course on his Big Cup menu. * * * * * * * * * * * PAOLO PLAYS UP (PART UMPTEEN) People sometimes wonder why Glenn Roeder has a face like someone sucking on a crate of lemons (minus the wood obviously, this is a hypothetical face). The answer, the Fiver has realised, is not only that the man was born with an unfortunate bone structure, he also has to work with Paolo Di Canio. After another average night's work for the Italian - a match-winning penalty, a potential FA-charge-incurring rant at Fulham supporters - Paolo seized the opportunity to go on at length about his contract, which expires at the end of the season and is the subject of eerie quiet on the part of the West Ham board. \"My contract is not a problem; I don't want to put the club under pressure,\" said Paolo entirely honestly. \"I have not asked for 1p, \u00a320m, \u00a3100bn, or even how many years I want to stay. It is only that I am not a player under trial and you don't know what qualities I have. I prove it every single day in training and I think it is fair to say what is happening.\" If you understand what all that means, then you are a better man than the Fiver. Yet, going out on a limb, we'd say Paolo's a little worried about being clubless come the summer. \"Everyone knows that I want to stay and I am not asking anything,\" he begged. \"I think it is reasonable to ask what do they want to do with me in the future, and it is not about 1p, \u00a320m, three years, or one year.\" Course not, and Paolo is a simple innocent. Anyone for a pint of Jif Lemon? * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Spurs are breaking down at the thought of Stephen Carr motoring after Sol Campbell along the Seven Sisters Road to Arsenal. Middlesbrough could offer Gabriel Batistuta a two-year deal worth \u00a31.9m. AC Milan are offloading their great Danes. Leeds want their right-back Thomas Helveg while Spurs are in for centre-back Martin Laursen. * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF The Imperial Lord Ferg has been given some dosh to hit the January sales for a new striker. \"The only thing is to buy!\" he said excitedly. Which surely means bye bye Diego Forlorn. Fifa and Uefa are planning to introduce a rule to limit the number of foreign players imported into domestic football. It could mean that at least six of the 11 players on any team be eligible for the national side of the league they are playing in. \"It would give clubs real incentive to develop players,\" said Uefa's Mike Lee. Everton striker Wayne Rooney had another reason to celebrate his 17th birthday today - with a call-up to England's U-19 squad for a mini-tournament next month. John Hartson's agent today declared that the striker is still \"in love\" with Celtic despite being left hurt with life on the sidelines. \"He wants to stay at Celtic,\" said Jonathan Barnett. \"He's not happy that he's not playing in every game. But he loves Celtic and he really does hope that his long-term future is with the club.\" * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV &amp; RADIO Channel 5: CIS Scottish League Cup - Hibernian v Rangers (7.35pm) Random quotes from the Fiver's book of the week, Leadership The Sven-Goran Eriksson Way, by Julian Birkinshaw and Stuart Crainer.
