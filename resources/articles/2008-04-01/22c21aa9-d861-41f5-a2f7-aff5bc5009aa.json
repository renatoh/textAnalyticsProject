Neither devotion (nor exasperation) can ever waver. But you are allowed to watch out for a few other fond family favourites and, in my case, anxiety about Fulham has been calmed a tad by Hereford's nervelessly assured march into League One. Graham Turner's exemplary long stewardship at Edgar Street is almost knighthood-deserving. Half a century ago, I cut my teeth reporting for the Hereford Times on the Bulls' away matches in the old Southern League. Home games were covered by the sports editor, crabby old-timer \"Polly\" Parrot, who had a spittoon beside his desk and would stamp his gammy leg in a self-harm fury every time I forgot the three semi-colons dividing the primeval 2-4-5 team formations, and when I invented the post-match loser's phrase \"sick as a parrot\" he'd violently excise it from my copy before hobbling to the editor's room again to demand my sacking. In a year or two I was on the Bristol Evening World and spoilt for choice - City or Rovers or John Blake's radical-running rugby XV. I often picked the decadent winsomeness of City's more central Ashton Gate, where John Atyeo was still banging them in and for the warm kindred affinity I felt on the covered terrace at the Winterstoke Road end which, I'm telling you true, was then grandly called \"the Keating Stand\". Apparently, the ramshackle edifice had been built in the early 1930s with proceeds from the sale for \u00a32,000 of a player called Keating. In itself, this was a significant family revelation for not a single soul of all my ancient clan has ever played first-class sport - excepting, that is, \"Babs\" Keating, Tipperary's rare and fabled dual-Gael luminary who in the 1960s won All-Ireland medals at both hurling and the Gaelic. The Keating Stand has long gone, but I retain a soft spot for Bristol sport. Difficult to believe now that the old city awoke on March 8 with Rovers, incredibly, two games from the FA Cup final, and City swaggeringly atop the Championship and poised to be only the third team ever to reach the Premier League on the back of successive promotions. Fairy godmothers are too often bitches and, alas for reality, Rovers woke up as humdrum League One cannon fodder while deflated City tremblingly await the play-offs. And all the fun and focus shifts westwards across the two bridges. Alack poor Wrexham, sure - but with the rugby and boxing it's already been a wildest-dreams' winter for Wales; and to cap it the Swans, lilywhite and elegant, glide serenely into the Championship and, almost preposterously, Cardiff's chirpy Bluebirds prepare for the FA Cup final itself. Feed Me Till I Want No More ain't in it. In salute, I've been relishing a rich and timely anthology of Welsh sportswriting - Sport, edited by estimable history scholar Gareth Williams (Partian, \u00a39.99). In readiness for Wembley, the Ninian Park paeans are being revisited and it was good to read again Dannie Abse's lingeringly evocative 50-year old classic: Follow the crowds to where the turnstiles click. The terraces fill. Hoompa, blares the brassy band. Saturday afternoon has come to Ninian Park and, beyond the goal posts, in the Canton Stand between black spaces, a hundred matches spark. Reading another lovely piece, as Abse's prose recalls his bright-faced boyhood in 1933, I sat up with a start. Well, listen to this: \"When I kicked a football in Roath Park or a tennis ball in the back lane, I underwent a wondrous metamorphosis. I wore an invisible royal blue shirt and I responded to the name of speedy Reg Keating, the City centre-forward, a blur of blue.\" Omigod! Was Reg, Cardiff's onetime \"blur of blue\", the same man whose sale built Bristol's Keating Stand? Or have I discovered another celebrated sporting ancestor? I can feel a whole dynasty coming on. With God on their side Another unlikely side preparing for a Cup final, Queen of the South, must be thoroughly fed up with being suffixed forever as the only club quoted in the Bible - Luke 11:31: \"The Queen of the South shall rise up.\" In fact, not true: I give you Isiah 41:7 and two clubs fingered in one sentence: \"He who smooths with the hammer spurs on him who strikes the anvil\". Or how about Proverbs 13:23: \"A poor man's field may produce abundant food\"? Not that a sacred mention has done any favours this season for those sad Stags of Mansfield."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
