And, just like that, the shine on their sexy new relationship has gone. A Brillo pad will do that. \u201cAlan, what the fuck?\u201d says Claire, appalled at how he has tidied up her studenty flat with its cigarette ends and used teabags on the side. Teacher Alan (Steven Macintosh) \u2013 remember from last week? \u2013 is the man who alphabetised his VHS collection, and now he is missing running the vacuum under his kids\u2019 legs and doing companionable washing-up with his therapist wife (Toni Collette). He and Claire (Zawe Ashton) were never going to work \u2013 she doesn\u2019t even own an iron. Wanderlust (BBC One), a six-part examination of middle-aged marriage and sex, came to a satisfying conclusion, if not exactly a mindblowing climax. What a strange series it has been. On the one hand, the slow-burn pace has felt novel when every other drama is fast and whizzy; on the other, it has sometimes been a bit boring. It feels like an elaborate test of modern attention spans. Nick Payne\u2019s script \u2013 adapted from his play \u2013 is often beautiful, and naturalistic, with all its \u201cums\u201d and \u201cers\u201d and repetition and pauses in the dialogue. But it can also be too theatrical. \u201cObviously, I\u2019m in love with you too,\u201d says Claire to Alan, haltingly and exaggerated, \u201cbut I\u2019m not sure I know how to do this at the expense of someone else. To me, that doesn\u2019t really feel like love.\u201d People don\u2019t really speak like that, do they? At least, not the people you would want to know in real life. Alan\u2019s response is to recount a dream in which his electric toothbrush had \u201ctiny little hands\u201d, proving that the only thing more tiresome than hearing about other people\u2019s dreams is having to hear about them from a TV character. \u201cMaybe you should see a therapist,\u201d deadpans Claire. The humour has always been the best thing about this show. It veers from the tediously dramatic \u2013 Joy is literally floored by the poignant discovery of her estranged husband\u2019s cufflink in the washing machine \u2013 to the mundane. In a drama with pretensions, even the dull bits make you feel as though you are supposed to be seeing profound truths in them. Is it a metaphor for the disconnect in their relationship when the man in Joy\u2019s couples\u2019 counselling session goes on about his drafty sash windows, or is he just a berk? Does Alan\u2019s concern about the boiler and the radiator in the hallway, in a phone call to Joy, signify the enduring warmth between the central couple, or is he genuinely concerned about the heating needs of their unfeasibly large and beautifully decorated house? Is Payne unreasonably preoccupied with home maintenance? Anyway, the plot is nicely tied up \u2013 Alan moves in with Claire, then moves out (he gets to keep the new iron); Joy makes a move on her ex Lawrence, but is rebuffed (he gets to keep his wife); she meets Emily, the widow of one of her clients who killed himself, and that goes well; then she gets back on her bike \u2013 literally and, this being Wanderlust, metaphorically \u2013 and cycles the route of her accident from the first episode. There is a lot of past being laid to rest. The children\u2019s love lives are all going well, in contrast to the mess their parents have made. But look, Alan and Joy still love each other, so he comes home with a dramatic sigh of relief \u2013 he even finds his missing poignant cufflink. Even Joy\u2019s lover Marc-with-a-C seems to be getting it on with Claire, so everything is neatly tied up. Despite it being so mannered and testing of my patience, I have enjoyed Wanderlust. The cast is terrific, it has a wonderful soundtrack and it tackled the themes of loss \u2013 of youth, desire, loved ones, opportunities \u2013 and what we want from life in a serious, if self-conscious, way. An overwhelming and unashamedly tender feel made up for the staginess. Like most things, I suppose, it helped if you were in the mood for it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
