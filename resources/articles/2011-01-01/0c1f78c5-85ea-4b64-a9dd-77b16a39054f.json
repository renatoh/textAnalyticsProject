Despite the 4-1 defeat in December 2007, Wigan survived largely through Bruce's skill but it would be interesting to monitor Roberto Mart\u00ednez's thoughts. Like Bruce he is discovering this is a club with considerable fight left in it. Wigan, short of players and badly missing the suspended Charles N'Zogbia had begun to look increasingly ragged when Ronnie Stam slid home a low cross from Steve Gohouri with barely 10 minutes remaining. For Bolton this was an opportunity squandered in a match that never rose above the mediocre, although for the Wigan keeper, Chris Kirkland, it was worse than that. Kirkland, standing in for Ali al-Habsi who was unable to play under the terms of his loan deal with Bolton, charged out of his goal to beat the onrushing Johan Elmander to the ball, arrived feet first and was taken off on a stretcher. With a draw against Arsenal and a win at Wolverhampton, Wigan had enjoyed a reasonable Christmas but the new year had not begun well. Mart\u00ednez thought they were \"as bad as we possibly could be\" against Newcastle on Sunday and victories for Fulham and Birmingham on Tuesday had seen Wigan dragged back into the relegation zone. Wolves' early goal at Molineux meant that when they kicked off at 8pm, 15 minutes afterwards, Wigan were technically bottom. Mart\u00ednez had made three changes from the side that had done so little to prevent Newcastle's first league win at Wigan and made a fourth before a quarter of an hour was up when Tom Cleverley was forced off with a hamstring injury. Having lost narrowly at Stamford Bridge and Anfield, Bolton should not have been short of momentum against the Premier League's lowest-scoring team but the raw fact on a rain-sodden night was that the only save of a wretched first half was made by the home keeper, Jussi Jaaskelainen. That came from a Hugo Rodallega free-kick which Match of the Day would call \"a comfortable height for the keeper\" but it was a save and by the standards of this contest that was something. Bolton may have adopted a more pleasing style under Coyle but after the interval they began to threaten with the old tactics that had made them such a force under Sam Allardyce. The corners and the free-kicks started pouring in and Gary Cahill headed over from barely six yards. Then came a touch of the new: a muscular run from Mark Davies, a telling pass to Rodrigo Moreno and a finish that betrayed the teenager's upbringing in the Real Madrid youth system that earned him a five-year contract with Benfica. His loan move to the Reebok was to supposed to finish his footballing education and this was a lovely goal in an unlovely match."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
