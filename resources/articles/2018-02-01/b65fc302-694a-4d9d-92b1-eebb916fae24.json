The prime minister risks a rift with Europe in a speech in which she will say the UK wants to stay closely aligned with Europe on security policy, but that \u201crigid institutional restrictions\u201d or \u201cdeep-seated ideology\u201d could leave gaps that terrorists and organised criminals may seek to exploit. \u201cThose who threaten our security would like nothing more than to see us fractured,\u201d the prime minister will tell world leaders at the Munich security conference. \u201cThey would like nothing more than to see us put debates about mechanisms and means ahead of doing what is most practical and effective in keeping our people safe. So let our message ring out loud and clear today: we will not let that happen. We will keep our people safe, now and in the years to come.\u201d Ahead of Saturday\u2019s speech, May appeared at a joint press conference with Angela Merkel in Berlin at which the two leaders spoke in conciliatory terms about the UK\u2019s future relationship with the European Union, with Merkel saying that she was \u201ccurious\u201d but \u201cnot frustrated\u201d with the British government\u2019s slow progress in outlining its plan. May\u2019s critics will argue one key problem is her rigid adherence to a red line in the Brexit negotiations of leaving the jurisdiction of the European court of justice, which has made continued cooperation more difficult. Jeremy Corbyn said: \u201cIf the prime minister wants to be taken seriously on keeping people safe, she should stop making veiled threats to our European neighbours and concentrate on safeguarding common European security and Britain\u2019s continued membership of Europol. And that means not letting her own rigid restrictions on any role for the ECJ stand in the way.\u201d May, who will speak directly before European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, is widely expected to say the UK would like to remain a member of Europol, the EU\u2019s law enforcement agency, and the European arrest warrant, but both are currently policed by the European court of justice. At the Munich conference, May will say she believes there are \u201cdamaging real world consequences\u201d if the EU\u2019s priority in the negotiation is not to break the precedent of signing new cooperation agreements with non-member states. The prime minister will propose a new UK-EU security treaty that Downing Street said would underpin the relationship on security and data sharing, which should be dynamic enough to adapt to new threats. There would need to be \u201creal political will on both sides\u201d for such a treaty to be developed, May said. No similar agreement exists between the EU and a third country that covers anything near the scale of the cooperation in the UK\u2019s existing relationship as a member state. May will argue there is no legal or operational reason why such an agreement could not be reached in the area of internal security. \u201cHowever, if the priority in the negotiations becomes avoiding any kind of new cooperation with a country outside the EU, then this political doctrine and ideology will have damaging real world consequences for the security of all our people, in the UK and the EU \u2026 as leaders, we cannot let that happen,\u201d she will say. In Berlin, Merkel said that the two sides had strong reasons to work together. \u201cI want to say that I am not frustrated, I am curious how Great Britain imagines our relationship to be,\u201d she said, describing the talks as \u201ca very candid exchange\u201d. \u201cOf course we have our vested interests, for example as regards to economic commitments we would like to preserve our partnership. Both sides are in a process of learning, finding out where there is common ground.\u201d May responded: \u201cIt isn\u2019t just a one-way street. I want a partnership with the European Union that is good for the main members of the European Union and Great Britain\u201d. EU officials and diplomats representing member states in Brussels have long regarded it as irrational of May to have made leaving the jurisdiction of the ECJ a red line in the talks about the future, and diplomats warned against the prime minister\u2019s hectoring tone. \u201cThe demand is what we expected but the lack of self-awareness is extraordinary\u201d, one said. Guy Verhofstadt, the European parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator, suggested the EU was willing to be flexible. \u201cIt would be a tragedy if red lines drawn up in haste compromised our existing cooperation,\u201d he said. May\u2019s speech will highlight the success of the security partnership with Europe, including Operation Triage, where police in the UK worked extensively with Europol and the Czech Republic to apprehend a trafficking gang, as well as the fast-track extradition of terror suspects and crime bosses. She will also underline the UK\u2019s data and intelligence contribution to Europol, and the sharing of real-time data on wanted criminals or suspected terrorists. Labour has already called on the prime minister to drop her red line on the ECJ to smooth future partnerships with the EU. Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer has called the pledge, made in the prime minister\u2019s Lancaster House speech, \u201cideological and deeply unhelpful\u201d. Brexit supporters have long argued against any continued jurisdiction of the European court of justice, arguing that it would mean Britain had surrendered its sovereignty by accepting the rulings of a higher court."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
