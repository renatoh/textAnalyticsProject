But where flour, eggs and butter are easy to find in home-grown, minimally processed, organic form, sugar presents the conscientious cook with a slightly more complex choice. \u00b7 When it comes to the classic baker's sugar, caster, you have the option of buying a British product, such as the Silver Spoon brand. But any sugar produced in this country will be derived from sugar beet and an intensive refining process is needed to create a usable end product. If you prefer a sugar that has undergone minimal processing, you'll need an imported brand made from sugar cane. \u00b7 To make a pure white, fine-grained sugar, whether from beet or cane, all the molasses has to be stripped from the raw product - and the sugar's caramelly flavour goes with it. That's why many cooks recommend an unrefined golden caster sugar as a more natural, flavoursome option. I'm all for it, but I've never found a golden caster sugar that's quite as fine-grained as the standard white variety, and I think this matters in some very delicate recipes such as meringue. Golden sugars will be fine in Gill's recipes, however. \u00b7 Brown sugars are always made from cane, but again can be quite heavily processed. Some soft brown or demerara sugars, for instance, are bleached and then dyed to make them look golden brown again. Look for unrefined demerara; and, when soft brown sugar is called for, try a light muscovado. This unrefined, damp-textured stuff is full of great flavour and ideal combined with golden sugars. \u00b7 Billington's produces very good, unrefined sugars, including organic golden caster and granulated, and light muscovado. Some of its products are also Fairtrade. They're widely available from supermarkets, grocers and delis, or go to billingtons.co.uk for stockist details."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
