You tend to see that normally towards the end of the season and because it hasn\u2019t happened this time there may be a couple of 17- or 18-year-olds who might have missed their moment. Because the academies are not back yet, these lads will end up going four or five months without playing and that\u2019s like being out with a serious injury.\u201d Euro 2020 should have been kicking off this weekend and without any prospect of international football on the horizon there is nothing this summer for fringe players such as Phil Foden and Mason Greenwood to aim at once the season resumes. Southgate considers Foden an almost unique talent in the English game \u2013 \u201cHe plays in an advanced midfield role and his attributes are rare in this country\u201d \u2013 but at the moment he is seeing more of Jadon Sancho because the Borussia Dortmund player is not only in a league that has resumed but at a club where he plays regularly. \u201cJadon is still very young, he\u2019s not going to get every decision right,\u201d Southgate said of the midfielder\u2019s visit from a barber, for which he was fined. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s quite the depth in the Bundesliga that there is in the Premier League, but he is playing regularly for one of the top teams, a side that is expected to perform at a high level. \u201cThe key for Phil Foden is whether he can make that happen at Manchester City. We spend a lot of time discussing potential but the bottom line for any young prospect is that he has to play. If Foden can break into the City side he will be playing at a very high level and then I am sure he will soon find himself in the England squad.\u201d When not keeping his eye on German football, Southgate has been enjoying some of the vintage England games being shown again on television during lockdown, even going as far back as the 1966 World Cup final. \u201cWhat struck me about that was the reaction of the crowd when England passed back to the goalkeeper with 10 minutes to go,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were 2-1 up but everyone started booing, they wanted a third. I sometimes think that as a nation we might not be cynical enough for sustained international success.\u201d In terms of more recent tournaments, Southgate is prepared to admit the boys of \u201990 and \u201996 were a little further down the development track than the present national squad. \u201cIt\u2019s very odd watching those games back, you know when the mistakes are coming,\u201d he said. \u201cBut compared to the young squad we have at the moment the England sides that last reached semi-finals were much more experienced. \u201cThere was far more experience of international and club football in those teams than the one that reached the World Cup semi-final in 2018. Those teams were a little further advanced at the time of their tournaments, but our players are coming on quickly. \u201cJust looking back to 2018, Harry Maguire was still taking baby steps into international football, now he\u2019s the captain of Manchester United. \u201cThe last few days have also shown that we have a generation of players who know their platform and are not afraid to speak out. They have a voice, and they know their messages carry weight. There\u2019s power in that, as we have recently seen.\u201d Southgate is referring to statements made in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, mostly from black, Asian and minority ethnic players, though he feels the game as a whole could do more to press for change. \u201cIt\u2019s understandable these guys are asked first for their opinions but marches and protests are always more powerful if there is a mix of people involved, it shouldn\u2019t just fall on our black people to change things,\u201d he said. \u201cNon-black players shouldn\u2019t duck the issue, even though it can be uncomfortable trying to defend things that are basically indefensible.\u201d Southgate was particularly distressed to hear Jermain Defoe question whether it was worth taking coaching qualifications in the light of the limited opportunities for black coaches or managers, and is frustrated by the unfairness and the waste of talent and experience. \u201cJermain was brilliant with us, we need people like him just as we also need people like Fabian Delph, Ashley Cole and Danny Rose,\u201d he said. \u201cRemoving that ceiling on achievement for ethnic minority groups is one of the biggest challenges we face and if we can\u2019t do it then we are not living in a country we can be proud of. The challenge is to make a difference right across society, not just in football, but football is something we can try to alter.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
