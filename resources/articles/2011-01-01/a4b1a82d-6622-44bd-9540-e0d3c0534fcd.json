Well, here it is. Just 24 hours ago, before the third day got under way, this match was ever so delicately poised, like a princess sipping tea from a Faberg\u00e9 teacup while balanced on a pinhead. Then England scored 321 runs for the loss of four wickets, to take a 208-run first-innings lead with three further wickets in hand, and delicacy and poise fled the building. Australia need to have a good day, a very good day, for the match to return to any semblance of competitiveness. On the other hand, today could be the day when England's muscle-bound trolls finally and decisively flay their piteous prey like so many highly-armed Sarah Palins on a weekend wolfhunt. And while we've got a minute, let's mark the passing of Dick King-Smith, creator of fictional porcine hero Babe. Many will have seen the popular film his tale inspired, in which an Australian taught a humble pig to expertly herd sheep. Really, the standard of coaching in the country has gone right downhill since then. There is no aspect of this evening that I'm not looking forward to. Experience teaches me that this, once it has engendered a feeling of utterly relaxed optimism, is when sport is at its most dangerous. I am ignoring this experience for the time being. Apparently Paul Collingwood has retired. Just a rumour at present. More to come, for sure. Paul Collingwood has indeed retired. Ideally he won't get a chance to have one, last, glorious Test knock, but it would be kinda nice if he did. In the meantime, I might liberally sprinkle tonight's MBM with good memories. Anyway, cricket! 141st over: England 489-7 (Prior 55, Bresnan 0) Johnson with the first over, just missing Bresnan's outside edge with his final ball. But Collingwood's retirement, announced just moments before the start of play today, is still dominating debate. 142nd over: England 493-7 (Prior 57, Bresnan 1) Hilfenhaus from the other end. \"Before we get started with the whole Ashes thing again, shouldn't there be a mention for Jacques Kallis in here, who has just hit twin hundreds against India to move on to an incredible 40 test tonnes?\" demands Dan Lucas. \"The guy's stats with both bat and ball are quite remarkable.\" Yeah, s'pose so. 143rd over: England 493-7 (Prior 57, Bresnan 1) Johnson's first ball finds Bresnan's outside edge, but it lands two feet short of Haddin. Good, positive bowling from Johnson. Here's the Press Association first take on the Collingwood news. Doesn't add much, really. \"England batsman Paul Collingwood has announced his retirement from Test cricket at the end of the fifth Ashes Test, the ECB have confirmed.\" Short and unshowy, much like the man himself. 144th over: England 496-7 (Prior 58, Bresnan 2) \"That was the obvious choice, and the best one,\" says Dennis Johns of that Colly catch. \"That was a great day in Bristol, one where after a joyous day spent getting through the cider we'd smuggled in, I turned to my dad as KP hammered another 6 and said \"Timing, pa. Timing is everything.\" He regarded, and still regards, this as a piece of almost Confuscian wisdom. Great player, anyway, for the catches, the 206, but mainly the 74 off 245 at Cardiff.\" 145th over: England 502-7 (Prior 59, Bresnan 7) Another edge from Bresnan flies well wide of second slip, away for four and brings up England's 500. This is the first England team ever to pass that mark four times in a series, and this is the first time any team from anywhere has done it against Australia. I should also pass on the news that Lawrence Booth, who those with long memories might remember from his OBO days before he became important, has got a good new job. Congratulations, sir. 146th over: England 504-7 (Prior 59, Bresnan 9) \"Former England coach David Lloyd described Collingwood as 'a yeoman, a stalwart and a grand lad' and lauded his decision to leave the side on his own terms,\" PA report. \"Lloyd, commentating on Sky Sports 1, said: 'He's still as fit as a fiddle but he said he needed runs in this series and it hasn't happened. He'll continue to play one-day cricket I'd assume and lead the Twenty20 side as well. I think it's an outstanding decision. He's a yeoman, a stalwart and a grand lad.'\" More Collingwood news as we get it here, though I'll keep bringing you occasional sepia-hued YouTube clips. 147th over: England 511-7 (Prior 66, Bresnan 9) Johnson's first ball is chipped, safely, over extra cover by Prior for two, and his second is edged low well short of first slip. The third is deliberately steered through third man. England are getting away with a few loose shots this morning. 148th over: England 514-7 (Prior 69, Bresnan 9) Hilfenhaus's last ball snarls up off the pitch and into Bresnan's glove. No danger, but a promising hint of fun to come for England's bowlers. And here's another classic Colly catch, to get rid of Faisal Iqbal during the Lord's Test in 2006. \"I'm thinking of buying a hat so I can take it off to Paul Collingwood,\" writes John Johnston. \"We'll all remember the catches and the athleticism in the field but for me there's more to him than that. In the not-too-distant dark days of English cricket seeing his name on the team sheet reassured me that at least somebody was going to walk to the middle with a bat in his hands and give his all for the team. He's the kind of player I adore, not blessed with divine skills but a grafter and a battler and I wish him well. I shall miss being able to make Admiral Collingwood / Admirable Collingwood puns though.\" 149th over: England 523-7 (Prior 78, Bresnan 9) Johnson's first ball is swatted through extra cover by Prior. The third, shockingly loose and wide by Johnson, is similarly tucked away. \"This is just carnage,\" says Botham. He finishes the over going round the wicket, on his captain's instructions. Botham, emboldened by the fact that Australian news broadcasts have been leading with his calling Philip Hughes a cheat, calls Philip Hughes a cheat again. 150th over: England 524-7 (Prior 79, Bresnan 9) Beer comes on, but there doesn't seem to be great encouragement for him. And here's Paul Collingwood attacking a disabled fan. 151st over: England 524-7 (Prior 79, Bresnan 9) Johnson continues round the wicket to Prior, occasionally causing him some discomfort, and the result is his fifth maiden of the innings. \"I'd like to suggest retiring the word 'gritty' when used in connection with cricket as a tribute to Colly,\" suggests Steve Churnin. \"Even if it's just a stereotype, it has been a much-loved one.\" 152nd over: England 524-7 (Prior 79, Bresnan 9) Continuing our Collingwood love-in, here's yet another ludicrous catch \u2013 which had the added benefit of giving Marcus Trescothick a rare wicket. And Phil Sawyer's got poetic: Collingwood, ill-shaven, hewn from ginger oak A proper gent, a proper bloke's bloke Can hit a six with a nonchalant smote Or block out 27 overs without a backstroke 153rd over: England 525-7 (Prior 80, Bresnan 9) Peter Siddle has a bowl to no great effect, and now they'll have some drinks. \"Can I add a dissenting view?\" asks James de Mellow. Why the hell not, James. \"While appreciating him as a destructive one-day player, fine fielder and good, honest pro, watching Colly bat in test cricket all these years has been nothing short of painful. The attempted cover drives that go to mid-wicket, the shovels off the back foot to spin, the dragged-out career-saving innings when I thought we'd be able to see the back of him for good. He's not been anywhere near fluent since 2006. Yes, the Cardiffs and Centurions were great, but there was an awful lot of dross in between. Remember Sri Lanka '07?\" A team needs a grafter, though. They can't all be abundantly gifted prodigies. The Collingwoods of the sporting world give hope to us normal folk. 154th over: England 528-7 (Prior 82, Bresnan 10) \"As a currently suffering Australian fan I will admit I am somewhat saddened to hear about the retirement of Colly, his arrival at the crease generally gave me a sinking feeling that the next few hours would likely be spent watching a redhead frustrate Autralians to no ends in a dross irritating manner,\" writes Rob Cartmill, as Beer meanders through another over. \" Somewhat akin to the current PM come to think of it.\" 155th over: England 529-7 (Prior 83, Bresnan 10) One ball to Prior, who gets a single, and five to Bresnan, who gets nowt. Bresnan's faced 66 deliveries for his 10 runs, with one four. Thrilling stuff. \"I don't want this to turn into a chorus of dissent as I'm as big a Colly fan as the next man, but I do think John Johnston's re-writing history. Apart from two tests v Sri Lanka in 2003 (when he didn't make a run) Colly's entire test career took place from the end of the 2005 Ashes series (which, I believe, we won) so hardly constitutes the \"dark days of English cricket\". Dare I suggest that John is confusing Paul Collingwood with Graham Thorpe?\" 156th over: England 530-7 (Prior 84, Bresnan 11) The highlight of Beer's over is a rare run for Bresnan off the last ball, his first for a few overs. Talking of highlights, here's some more Colly, winning us the World Twenty20 last year. 157th over: England 539-7 (Prior 85, Bresnan 18) Emboldened by that run off Beer, Bresnan smacks Siddle for a splendid four through point. And here's some more poetry, from Danny Clayton. So. Farewell Then, Paul Collingwood, English cricketer, Taker of miracle catches. Collywobbles they called you, But you will wobble for us, No more. 158th over: England 542-7 (Prior 87, Bresnan 19) Beer's success is such that Smith's coming on from the other end. There'll be a new ball due at the end of this next over. 159th over: England 547-7 (Prior 90, Bresnan 21) Since the first couple of overs this morning, the level of comfort enjoyed by England's batsmen has been astonishing. They'll be coming out in slippers next. 160th over: England 551-7 (Prior 94, Bresnan 21) Australia don't take the new ball, sticking with Beer for now. Off the penultimate ball Prior has a go at paddling the ball down to fine leg. It works well, so he does it again, bringing up England's 550 in the process. 161st over: England 561-7 (Prior 95, Bresnan 31) Bresnan boshes Smith's second ball straight down the ground for a one-bounce boundary, then does it again off the last. This could be turning into the most embarrassing session of the series for Australia. There's nothing there at the moment. No passion, spirit, or apparent ability. 162nd over: England 567-7 (Prior 101, Bresnan 31) Australia persevere with their two-spinner policy, and Prior duly trundles to his century from 109 balls with a simple four off a loose Beer ball. \"I share Rob Cartmill's pain. It doesn't get any more demoralising than an innings defeat in two consecutive matches,\" says Hayden Kendall. \"We'll never really know the true extent with which we've been comprehensively smashed. Still, watching Colly and co is far less drab and irritating than watching say, Jonny Wilkinson.\" 163rd over: England 571-7 (Prior 104, Bresnan 31) \"Michael Clarke was still saying Australia could win this match last night,\" reports Matt Reilly. \"About as convincing as a Phil Hughes appeal.\" 164th over: England 573-7 (Prior 105, Bresnan 32) Still no sign of this new ball. I'm looking forward to seeing how England's bowlers do given a last chance to have a go at the Aussies, but starting to wonder if they might not get that chance. These two could just bat out the remaining five-and-a-bit sessions, at this rate. 165th over: England 584-7 (Prior 111, Bresnan 35) Australia take the new ball, and hand it to Mitchell Johnson, whose lazy half-volley is smashed away by a rapidly emboldening (is that a word) Bresnan. Prior also scoops a boundary down past third man. \"He's going to flash hard,\" warns David Lloyd. Flash hard, eh? The mind boggles. 166th over: England 584-7 (Prior 111, Bresnan 35) A maiden from Hilfenhaus, who on one occasion tempts Bresnan to flash hard but there's no contact. \"Looking at Steve Smith's face reminds me of a small boy constantly on the verge of bursting into tears,\" writes Phil Withall. \"He seems to be struggling to comprehend what's going on.\" For some reason \u2013 and even I don't think there's a particularly striking resemblance \u2013 Smith reminds me of children's TV legend Mr Tumble. Maybe they're both fall guys. WICKET! Bresnan c Clarke b Johnson 35 (England 589-8) Finally, a breakthrough. Given how unlikely it's looked for so long, Clarke does excellently well to take a diving catch at second slip. 167th over: England 589-8 (Prior 116, Swann 0) The over is preceded by a long drinks break, with the Australian bowlers conducting a crisis meeting in the middle. When it gets going, Johnson bowls wide outside off stump and a delighted Prior flashes hard for another boundary. That, presumably, was not the plan, though Bresnan's wicket improves matters slightly. \"Why no delcaration,\" asks Sara Williams. \"We've double their score and Prior's got his century. This is just gifting critics who say Strauss has no tactical nous. Why are we still batting?\" But what have England to gain from turning down the chance to accumulate extra runs with the best part of two days to go? 168th over: England 596-8 (Prior 117, Swann 1) Four leg byes off a loose first ball from Hilfenhaus. This is, apparently, the first time any Test team \u2013 anyone's, ever \u2013 has seen their sixth, seventh and eighth-wicket partnerships each garner over 100 runs. 169th over: England 608-8 (Prior 118, Swann 13) Swann flashes hard, gets a thick edge and the ball flies through the slip cordon for four, taking England past 600. Australia have never before conceded 600 twice in a series at home. Swann's not messing about here. Another four and a ludicrously-boshed shot over the covers that stopped a couple of yards short of the boundary. WICKET! Prior's gone! No, hang on \u2013 it's a no ball! Again! Umpires reviewing this. It's very close... He's out after all! Prior c Haddin b Hilfenhaus 118 (England 609-9) A slight edge chasing after a very poor ball from Hilfenhaus, the heel of whose foot turned out after several replays to have landed maybe two millimetres behind the line. 170th over: England 609-9 (Swann 14, Tremlett 0) And that's the last ball of the over. Prior probably doesn't care, but that was a poor delivery to lose your wicket to. 171st over: England 629-9 (Swann 31, Tremlett 3) Swann's going to go down fighting. 20 runs off Johnson's over, including an attempted hook top-edged by Swann for six. It's humiliation piled on humiliation, with some embarrassment on top. 172nd over: England 629-9 (Swann 31, Tremlett 3) Tremlett fairly easily survives Hilfenhaus's over, only actually having to hit one ball. England lead by 349. REVIEW! There was definitely a noise as Siddle's ball flew past Swann's flashing blade, but what made it? Australia would like to know. Hot Spot isn't showing anything, so though there was a sound there'll be no wicket. 173rd over: England 630-9 (Swann 32, Tremlett 3) There's something utterly desperate about Australia's situation, pushing them into optimistic reviews aiming to gift them a 10th wicket. The good news for them is that Tremlett doesn't look likely to stick around long, though someone should probably try aiming at his stumps, something that Siddle didn't seem very keen on. \"If that had been a no-ball, Simon, I think it would have been the Aussies' 20th in the series versus England's two,\" points out Clare Davies. \"But maybe it'll stop some of the Aussie whinging about the unfairness of technology.\" 174th over: England 633-9 (Swann 34, Tremlett 4) Hilfenhaus sticks another 50p in the comedy generator by letting the ball just slip out of his hand just as he's about to bowl to Tremlett, near enough hitting his own foot. A dead ball, but a clown attempting to do a comedy hilarious calamity delivery couldn't improve on that one. \"The exclamation mark after the word \"REVIEW\" just makes me feel that little bit more depressed,\" writes Michael Gascoigne. Snickometer has since revealed that the ball flicked Swann's collar. 175th over: England 636-9 (Swann 33, Tremlett 7) That's lunch, 148 runs in the session at 4ish an over and England aren't done yet. \"Are we not witnessing the death - or something like it - of Australian cricket?\" ponders Dan Jeffreys. \"The stumps from this humiliating innings should be burnt and placed in a tiny urn for future generations of cricketers to battle - and weep - over whenever the phrase \"600+ is uttered\". Oh wait, hasn't something like this been done before?\" LUNCH Hello folks. That's how to close out a series, eh? In the morning session England achieved the ostensibly impossible task of putting the foot on the Australian throat while simultaneously rubbing their nose in the dirt. And all this while giving them a wedgie of surgery-necessitating proportions. After that, Australia will have to show some serious stones to avoid defeat. As England found on the subcontinent in 2003 and 2005, there can be few more dispiriting experiences in cricket than batting to save a match you needed to win to secure a series draw. A wee word about Paul Collingwood. There will be many tributes to Collingwood over the next 24 hours, but few if any will sum him up better than this old line from Tim de Lisle, who wrote that Collingwood was \"the housemate who at least tries to clear up the mess\". England don't really make a mess any more \u2013 well, except on bouncy pitches \u2013 so it's a good time for Collingwood to be replaced by the Irish genius, a much more attacking batsman. Collingwood's fielding and dressing-room influence cannot be replaced, so don't even bother trying. He has been a good Test batsman, a useful bowler, a truly great fielder, and an evenm better bloke. Lawrence Booth, Wisden Editor \"May I be one of, no doubt, many to ask for you to pass on congratulations to Lawrence Booth for being asked to edit Wisden,\" says Phil Rhodes. \"A fine achivement. Could you also ask him whether he would swap editing Wisden for Northamptonshire winning the County Championship...\" Amen to this. Booth is a class act in everything he does, a top man and a brilliant all-round journalist. That job was always his destiny, but to get it at the tender age of 44 is remarkable. Our warmest congratulations go to him, and not just because we're trying to butter him up with a view to getting some work. Statwatch Graeme Swann and Chris Tremlett need one run for the highest-ever score by an England side in Australia. It would be much cooler to declare. Zooey Deschanel would declare. Cricket captains should always ask themselves: What Would Zooey Do. Besides, if England declare it will keep their average runs per wicket in this series at 51.92. Only twice, in their 134 years as a Test-playing nation, have Australia had that kind of hurt put on them. While you wait, why not read this fine piece by Emma John on a subject close to all our hearts: dreaming about Geoffrey Boycott. \"Am getting excited about the 'Combined' XI from this series,\" says Tom Bowtell, redefining excitement'. \"Now that Prior has got a century (and seeing as he's taken twice as many catches as Brad) there's a pretty good case to be made for the following team: Cook, Strauss (Captain), Trott, Pietersen, Hussey, Bell, Prior, Bresnan, Swann, Anderson, Tremlett.\" The consensus, here and on Sky, is for Prior, but Haddin made runs when they really mattered so I would go with him. Watson v Strauss is close \u2013 Watson has more runs at a higher average \u2013 but Strauss shades it for that initiative-seizer at the Gabba. That was such an important innings. England are batting on. In a series that has haemmorhaged records, they are about to claim one of the biggest. Some other business. There is tentative talk of an OBO book for this series. I know, fools. The title, nicked homaged from a reader email, was inspired in 2005. Any suggestions for this one? 177th over: England 643-9 (Swann 35, Tremlett 12) Michael Beer bowls the first ball after lunch, and Graeme Swann works it to leg. So this is England's highest-ever score in a Test in Australia. Dear me, what kind of world are we living in where the England cricket team are doing this? And they only need 267 for the highest score in any Ashes Test. Tremlett clatters four of them through the covers. \"I was going to tweet this but thought I'd go old school and email in,\" says Ravi Motha. \"Is it a little bit strange to think that the GU MBM and OBO has been round: a- for so long (8+ years) b- that we no longer (regularly pray for rain) c- everyone and their dogs does MBM and OBO d- how cricket has changed: Twenty20, the IPL, Stanford, Aussie cricket, English cricket, Gary Naylor.\" WICKET! England 644 all out (Tremlett c Haddin b Hilfenhaus 12) Tremlett tickles Hilfenhaus through to the keeper, and that's the end of a monstrous innings from England: 644 all out. Six hundred and forty four all out. Six hundred and forty four all out. Six hundred and forty four all out, etc and so forth. And 418 of those for the last five wickets. Who needs flowery prose when you have numbers like that? England lead by 364, and I'll be back in a few minutes for Australia's second innings. INNINGS BREAK So here we are. One way or the other, whether England win or Australia survive, this will probably be the last innings of the 'Can bat, can bowl, can field' tour. England should savour every moment of these five sessions, or however long it takes, because they might never experience anything as good as this again in their careers. 1st over: Australia 7-0 (Watson 7, Hughes 0) Have some of that! Shane Watson starts the innings with seven runs off the first two balls: a disdainful pull over midwicket for four and a nice cover drive for three. Anderson and Watson are having words already. It'll be forgotten over the post-series beer. Either that or they'll have a massive punch-up over who should have the last VB stubby. \"Sampson Collins has just coughed pie onto both our computers, the desk and the camera we use for the excitingly dynamic 2.0 news vodcasting sensation Two Pricks at the Ashes,\" says Jarrod Kimber, instinctively knowing that I would not rest easy until I had been told about any pie-related tomfoolery in the SCG pressbox. 2nd over: Australia 7-0 (Watson 7, Hughes 0) Chris Tremlett, who some gobsh folk thought shouldn't even be on this tour, will share the new ball. He's been the revelation of the series, and might well keep that new ball even when Stuart Broad returns to the attack. Watson rifles a couple of drives straight to the fielder at extra cover. As Carly Simon didn't say, nobody pings them straight at the fielders better. It's a maiden. \"Assaulting Matilda,\" says Mac Millings. I don't know whether this is a status update or a suggested book title, but it has noth something going for it. 3rd over: Australia 10-0 (Watson 8, Hughes 2) Anderson strays onto the pads and Hughes tucks a single to fine leg to get off the mark. \"Zoo Deschanel did 500 Days of Summer,\" says Paul Neilan. \"She'd never declare.\" Didn't she declare at 350-odd, only for that sorry goon to keep playing for another 150 days even though everybody else had gone home? 4th over: Australia 13-0 (Watson 8, Hughes 5) England have Cook in an interesting leg gully position for Hughes, who works Tremlett off his pads for a couple. Hughes never really looks comfortable against Tremlett and gets a leading edge into the off side later in the over. \"Rob,\" says Jonah Gadsby. \"Remember this?\" Never heard it before. 5th over: Australia 18-0 (Watson 12, Hughes 6) What an odd little incident. Hughes plays a decent forward defensive against Anderson and is so unnerved by this unusual display of competence that he completely forgets about the ball that might be bouncing back towards stumps. Eventually he wakes up and kicks it away. If he is batting time, trying to build an innings, Watson is hitting out and plays another withering and flamboyant pull stroke for four. \"Punter's Last Stand?\" offers Paul Tooby. \"Actually, I prefer Gladstone Small's Last Interview.\" 6th over: Australia 18-0 (Watson 12, Hughes 6) Two excellent deliveries from Tremlett richochet off the inside edge of Hughes' crooked bat and back into his body. A very good maiden. Tremlett is working Hughes over, again. \"Can we just call the OBO book for this series '517-1'?\" says Jamie Jermain. 7th over: Australia 25-0 (Watson 19, Hughes 6) That's aother boundary for Watson, this time a back cut off Anderson. The next ball is a nasty, lifting off-cutter that Watson desperately inside-edges onto his rump. There is just enough uneven bounce to get inside the batsmen's heads. Chuck in Swann and it's pretty hard to see Australia getting out of this. \"It has to be 'Fetch That, Jim Maxwell!' in honour of the OBO-ABC sledging war (and the copious run-scoring),\" says Peter Hanes. Cripes, I'd forgotten all about that. 8th over: Australia 34-0 (Watson 28, Hughes 6) Watson is playing almost a shot a ball, and he slices a booming drive behind point for four off Tremlett. Two balls later he plays a wonderful drive through mid-off for four more. He has 28 from 24 deliveries. \"Book title \u2013 Beijing,\" says Rossa Brugha. \"As far as I can tell every day for the entire series has included the phrase, 'Does anyone know where I can watch the cricket in Beijing?' So I think that's apt.\" I prefer the longer version of the title. It's kooky. Zooey would like the longer version. 9th over: Australia 34-0 (Watson 28, Hughes 6) Graeme Swann is into the attack after eight overs, which is surely a good move. There's a slip and short leg for Watson, who is almost tempted by a flighted fourth delivery but otherwise defends carefully. A maiden. \"Oxford St has never looked lovelier,\" says Mike Selvey. \"The topless hairdressers proved elusive but the window of the House of Fetish gleamed in the sun and there was even time to window shop at Celebrity Wigs. Oh to be a celebrity and be able to go in. Stroll enhanced and traffic drowned out by iPod with Pearl Jam Live at Madison Sq Garden, 2003, including, as I arrived in the press box, a cover of I Believe Miracles by THE RAMONES. Mike McCready one of the underrated guitarists and Eddie Vedder a great vocalist. Discuss.\" I'm saying nothing. 10th over: Australia 43-0 (Watson 36, Hughes 7) Hughes calls Watson through for a tight single. Watching Watson wince his way through quick singles is a thing of comic beauty. He approaches them with the same joie de vivre of Basil Fawlty being called in to the office for a chat with Sybil. But Watson sure knows how to hit boundaries and he laces another delicious extra-cover drive for four. I hope he gets a ton today; he certainly deserves one. After being beaten by a horrid lifter, he swivel-pulls very fine for his seventh boundary. \"I could see Chris Tremlett looking awfully beautiful in a blond wig,\" says Olly Keir. \"He seems very Marylin Monroe-esque with his beauty spot.\" I like the sentiment but I'm not sure it works as a book title. Honk! Ho-honk! 11th over: Australia 43-0 (Watson 36, Hughes 7) Swann gets his first bowl at Hughes, who inside-edges an arm ball onto his pads. He is struggling here. There are shades of Mark Lathwell about Hughes, a sublime natural talent but one who is so precarious (mentally in Lathwell's case, technically in Hughes's) that there is a better than even chance he won't make it. Another maiden for Swann. \"Yeah,\" says Chris Matthews, \"what ever came of the ABC vs OBO row?\" They bottled it. 12th over: Australia 45-0 (Watson 36, Hughes 7) Bresnan replaces Tremlett. Two from a tight over. \"Given the Bring Back Warne campaign, surely the title should be, Is it Cowardly to Pray For Shane?\" That suggestion comes from Rick Foot, but maybe, in honour of the champagne moment of the series, it should simply be called David Gower's Foot. WICKET! Australia 46-1 (Watson run out 36) What a shemozzle. What a total, abject farce. Hughes turns Swann through midwicket and sets off; they take one and then Watson trots leisurely back for a second, completely oblivious to the fact that Hughes has not moved. Pietersen and Prior do the rest. Both of them were ballwatching. England are happy as Larry; Watson is as happy as Larry David. What a daft way to get out, particularly because he was playing beautifully. In Guardian Towers, Smyth and Burnton have an impromptu cackle-off. That was a shocking run out. 13th over: Australia 46-1 (Hughes 8, Khawaja 0) Watson has played 15 Test innings against England, and 12 of them have been between 34 and 62. I've started so I won't finish. In other news, this is an inspired idea from Steven House: a pink cover. \"As yellow is to Wisden so pink will become to OBO. A cover like this perhaps ... only with a B obviously ... OBO Towers.\" 14th over: Australia 50-1 (Hughes 12, Khawaja 0) Hughes uppercuts Bresnan for four to bring up the fifty. Australia trail by 314. \"Given that Australia are now, frankly, crap do you think we'll do a Sri Lanka and reinvigorate our morale by putting together a punishing schedule of Tests against also-rans?\" says Adam Woolcock. \"Wouldn't surprise me if the first thing the ACA do tomorrow is start a lobby to bring Zimbabwe back into the fold and give Test status to Estonia.\" 15th over: Australia 51-1 (Hughes 12, Khawaja 1) It's a different challenge for Khawaja, coming in against the spinner. He works a single off the pads to get off the mark. \"OBO Book Title,\" says Anthony Boge. \"About Effing Time.\" He didn't say effing. 16th over: Australia 51-1 (Hughes 12, Khawaja 1) There's a man just off the cut strip on the leg side for Khawaja, who is beaten by a delivery slanted across him by Bresnan. Encouragingly, Bresnan's fourth delivery reverse-swung. Somewhere in Sydney, Michael Vaughan is doing the reverse-swing hand signal. I miss that. \"Chronic sleep deprivation has been the theme of the series,\" says Dave Adams, \"so I suggest something like 'Just One More Over'.\" 17th over: Australia 52-1 (Hughes 13, Khawaja 1) Swann is toying with Hughes. He clearly feels there's a relatively cheap top-order wicket to be had and is working him over with all his variations. There's a biggish shout LBW shout when Hughes pads up, but it didn't straighten enough and would probably have bounced over as well. Still, these are really tough times for Hughes. \"They Shoot Aussies, Don't They?\" offers Lev Parikian. 18th over: Australia 52-1 (Hughes 13, Khawaja 1) This is good stuff from Bresnan, very accurate and with just enough movement to challenge the batsmen. It's a maiden to Hughes, who has 13 from 56 balls now. After 30 years of hunting high and low, Australia may just have found their own Chris Tavare. \"Am probably the umpteenth person to suggest this for a book title already,\" begins Austin Hill, who is actually the first, the last, the only, \"but how about: Is This The worst Australian Team Ever?\" 19th over: Australia 52-1 (Hughes 13, Khawaja 1) Swann is loving this. Two left-handers to play with; a lead of nine million; a wearing pitch. He's in his element, and at the moment the batsmen have no aims beyond survival. The fifth ball was a beauty to Khawaja that drifted in and then spat past the outside edge. It's another maiden, so Swann's figures are 6-3-3-0. \"Doesn't the title 'How About Best of Seven?' sum up the respective abject domination and utter bankruptcy of this series?\" asks Jeffrey Feim. WICKET! Australia 52-2 (Hughes c Prior b Bresnan 13) Phil Hughes' excruciating innings comes to an end, although it took a very nice delivery from Bresnan to get rid of him. It bounced from a length and left him a touch as well. Hughes had to play in his danger area outside off stump and edged it to Prior, who just held on to the catch as he dived in front of first slip. 20th over: Australia 52-2 (Khawaja 1, Clarke 0) Michael Clarke is booed to the crease for the second time in the match, a total nonsense. He's beaten on the inside by his second delivery, which doesn't miss off stump by much. He then survives a big shout for LBW. No review from England. It was going down I think. \"644 Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest,\" offers Neil. 21st over: Australia 54-2 (Khawaja 3, Clarke 0) Khawaja cuts Swann behind point for a couple. \"Cook &amp; Bell: Cock &amp; Bull by Smyth and Bull,\" says Paul Tooby. If I change my name by deed poll to Rob Cock that title will look even better. 22nd over: Australia 63-2 (Khawaja 3, Clarke 6) Clarke reaches outside off stump to time Bresnan nicely through the covers for four. He then leaves his crease in the course of a defensinve stroke and turns round sharply as the short leg Cook throws at (and misses) the stumps. Shades of the last innings of the last Ashes series, when Clarke was run out after dribbling one to short leg. I think he'd have been safe this time even if Cook had hit the stumps. \"If Australia loses this Test by an innings (or Cook fails to score in the last innings), there can't be much competition for '766 and All That'?\" says Jacco Schalkwijk. It's just dawned me on that this discussion of what the book should be called will be in the book itself. It's like a bloody Chris Nolan movie! 23rd over: Australia 69-2 (Khawaja 4, Clarke 11) Khawaja has played Swann well thus far, with a clear head, and has been beaten only by that snorter a couple of overs back. He gets a single and then Clarke blasts Swann over the covers for four. Good shot. \"I think we've all forgotten, amidst the rampant triumphalism, what our feelings were as the series began,\" says Nick Oon. \"The anticipation, the slight trepidation, deliciously heightened when\u2026It Started With a Draw. There's your title. Or you can just be literal and call every Ashes book hereafter 'REVIEW!'.\" Or, in view of that start to the series, 'Strauss c Hussey b Hilfenhaus 0'. Catchy title, that. 24th over: Australia 69-2 (Khawaja 4, Clarke 11) Bresnan is definitely reversing it, and that's a maiden to Khawaja. Does anything in life cricket engender such giddy expectation as the realisation that the ball is reversing? It's like a beautiful person whispering in your ear about what they would like to do to you: it makes your face go eek and your brain spin at the thought of what kind of sauciness could happen over the next couple of hours. Or something. \"Given the reversal in fortunes seen in this Ashes, how about taking a title from the cracking OBO line: 'Hubris? Meet my friend Mr Nemesis',\" suggests Jon Watts. 25th over: Australia 70-2 (Khawaja 4, Clarke 12) Swann gets one to bounce nastily on Khawaja, who does extremely well to get on top of the ball and drop it short of the close fielders. He's getting an invaluable examination here, and he's handling it pretty well. \"Sorry,\" says Oliver Benson, \"but can you please just print this so I can have my name in a book?\" Have you not heard of the Phone Book? 26th over: Australia 77-2 (Khawaja 4, Clarke 19) Tremlett replaces Bresnan, who bowled an excellent spell of 7-4-12-1. Clarke cuts his second ball up and over backward point \u2013 though not by that much \u2013 for four. That's where Clarke fell in the first innings but, as Mike Atherton says on Sky, this time he deliberately went up and over. He then works three through midwicket. So in this innings the experienced right-handers have 57 from 62 balls and the young left-handers have 17 from 94 balls. It's an ageist, leftist scorecard. \"A bit long,\" says Yemon Choi, \"but how about an appeal to the classics? 'Look upon my works, ye mighty, and despair.'\" The classics? Er, hello, this is, like, the Guardian? 27th over: Australia 77-2 (Khawaja 4, Clarke 19) Swann has gone around the wicket to Clarke, with both a slip and gully. He did Clarke like this at Melbourne, caught at slip from one that ran straight across him. It's a maiden, and that's tea. See you in 15 minutes. TEA \"You haven't included any of my emails,\" says Jack from Sydney. \"And the one's you have included are mostly shit. Can you hurry up and get this book published, I'm running low on toilet paper.\" 28th over: Australia 79-2 (Khawaja 6, Clarke 19) Ready? Good. There are 32 overs remaining, the first of which will be bowled by Chris Tremlett. There's a big appeal against Khawaja for a catch down the leg side from the very first ball, but Billy Bowden says no and Andrew Strauss decides not to review. Replays suggest it just hit his thigh pad. Khawaja then pulls a couple through square leg. \"Book title \u2013 Adelaide!\" says Dave Pople. \"With the exclamation mark, I think.\" It's a dealbreaker. 29th over: Australia 87-2 (Khawaja 7, Clarke 26) Swann continues around the wicket to Clarke. A contest between these two is always fascinating, because Clarke is such an excellent, fleet-footed player of spin. He comes down the track to the second ball, chipping it splendidly over mid-on for four, and then pings the next delivery through midwicket for three. \"I'm not going to read this book,\" says Richard Sparks, \"because I already know the cook did it.\" 30th over: Australia 88-2 (Khawaja 7, Clarke 26) Tremlett beats Clarke with a laughably unplayable monster that roars and growls and seams past the outside edge. \"On Channel 9, Ian Healy is blatantly suggesting ball-tampering, and questioning how on earth the ball could be so roughed up after just 27 overs,\" says Amirali Abdullah. \"Jeez. Reminds me of English media in 1992 whingeing about how Pakistan MUST be up to something fishy to get so much reverse swing. It's called being a better set of bowlers.\" What are you talking about? Don't you realise that reverse swing was cheating before England got good at it? 31st over: Australia 95-2 (Khawaja 11, Clarke 29) Swann drops short and is cut through the covers for three by Clarke. I'd be quite tempted to try seam from both ends for half an hour, as Clarke is looking really good against Swann at the moment. \"Surely the point of releasing a book is to sell loads of copies and makes lots of money,\" says Stuart Wilson. \"This isn't going to be achieved using OBO based in jokes and punnery. As such can I suggest a title that will appeal to the masses: 'Lesbian Bath Time'? The dual bonus is that, if you print my suggestion, the hits on OBO will suddenly rocket via the disappointed google searches of thousands of teenage boys.\" It's what SEO was invented for. 32nd over: Australia 96-2 (Khawaja 12, Clarke 29) Khawaja completely misses an attempt hook at a ball from Tremlett that was fairly wide of off stump. I think he was too early on the shot. Then he flicks a single to leg. He has 12 from 53 balls, and Australia trail by 268. I reckon that's the first time in history that that exact sentence has been used. \"Book title?\" says Tom Savage. \"Pride and Prejudice.\" 33rd over: Australia 96-2 (Khawaja 12, Clarke 29) When Khawaja defends against Swann, England tentatively appeal for a catch at silly point via the boot. Aleem Dar says not out, and nobody looks too fussed \u2013 but that was very close. He played it into his toe but then almost certianly bounced before going to silly point. \"They bowl cross-seam for starters,\" says Lord Selvey. \"Look at the Hughes dismissal and see the way the ball goes down.\" 34th over: Australia 100-2 (Khawaja 12, Clarke 33) Clarke slaps an urgent cut for four off Tremlett. \"The Cook, The Grief, His Wides and Her Bother,\" says Matt Lindsay. \"Alastair Cook; The Australian audience; Johnson's Bowling; @theashes.\" Maybe @theashes would work. Very 2.0. Very Nathan Barley. 35th over: Australia 104-2 (Khawaja 16, Clarke 33) I was going to say that Khawaja only looked comfortable attacking Swann when he dropped short, but that was a classy extra-cover drive for four to bring up the fifty partnership. \"16.44: The Emasculation Of Richard Ponting,\" suggests Mark Reed. 36th over: Australia 104-2 (Khawaja 16, Clarke 33) Jimmy Anderson is going to replace Chris Tremlett. His first over is a maiden to Clarke, almost all of the deliveries just a fraction too wide of off stump and therefore okay for Clarke to leave. Mind you, he'll be loath to leave outside off if Anderson starts to reverse it; Old Trafford 2005 and all that. \"Can I reserve 'Khawaja Like Them Apples?' for the 2013 series book title?\" says Joe Meredith. \"Just in case like.\" That is so bad it's gone past good, back to bad and then back to good again. 37th over: Australia 113-2 (Khawaja 17, Clarke 37) That's a ludicrous delivery from Swann. It was a touch wider and turned viciously to beat the outside edge of Khawaja and fly past the left hand of Prior for four byes. There are four more runs later in the over, strong-armed through midwicket by Clarke. That sets Warne off on an incredulous one about the 4/5 field for Swann. \"@theashes: I am not a freakin' book!!!!\" suggests Harry Parker. That's not 2.0; that's bloody 3.0. WICKET! Australia 117-3 (Khawaja c Prior b Anderson 21) That's wicket No22 of the series for Jimmy Anderson, although it was a pretty tame dismissal. The ball after dumping a pull for four, Khawaja feels for a very wide, reverse-swinging delivery and gets the thinnest of edges through to Matt Prior. Smart bowling but a needless shot. 38th over: Australia 117-3 (Clarke 37, Hussey 0) \"Pretty in Pink,\" says Steven House, \"though I say so myself.\" You're right: you do say so yours that pink is pretty. 39th over: Australia 118-3 (Clarke 38, Hussey 0) Swann has gone back over the wicket to Clarke. I had a bet before the series that he would average over 40. His average is curreCOME ON AUSTRALIA.ntly 39.92. \"To not sleep, perchance to dream,\" says Dan MacDonald. 40th over: Australia 118-3 (Clarke 38, Hussey 0) Clarke chases a wide one from Anderson but his bat gets intimate with nothing but fresh air. A maiden, and Anderson is bowling beautifully with the ageing ball. \"Naming a whole book is too big a task for my tiny mind,\" says Neill Brown. \"However, I'd like to put forward a suitably surreal chapter heading for the Adelaide Test, based on the scorecard: 'Finn Peaks: Prior Catches Three'.\" That's wonderfully naff. 41st over: Australia 118-3 (Clarke 38, Hussey 0) A maiden from Swann to Hussey. That's the kind of plasticine-sharp insight you expect from the OBO. 42nd over: Australia 118-3 (Clarke 38, Hussey 0) Clarke pads up to a reverse-swinger, and I bet he was having a nasty flashback as the ball came back towards his off stump. But it was a good leave because he left it on length and it just bounced over. Another excellent maiden from Anderson, though. His first spell was 4-0-22-0; in this spell he has 4-3-4-1. \"'Bollinger Opened, Johnson Out, Hussey Bowled Over',\" suggests Jack in Sydney. You can see where this is going, can't you? \"Not an Ashes report... it's Shane War-\" [That'll do \u2013 imaginary ed] 43rd over: Australia 124-3 (Clarke 41, Hussey 3) Six from Swann's over, including a leading edge after Hussey was done in the flight. Drinks. \"Good Mitchell, Bad Mitchell, and Superbad Jimmy,\" suggests Marie Meyer. WICKET! Australia 124-4 (Clarke c Prior b Anderson 41) This is absolutely magnificent bowling from Jimmy Anderson. Quite stunning. He has been working Clarke over with the reverse-swinging ball and he gets him with a lovely delivery that invites the drive and moves late to take the edge on its way to Prior. Clarke is furious with himself but Anderson was just too good there. 44th over: Australia 124-4 (Hussey 3, Haddin 0) Anderson's spell is now 5-4-4-2. How will he cope with the old Kookaburra?! \"Gutted that you missed out on the Wisden gig,\" says Tony Brennan. \"I'd pay good money to see the long-awaited list of Five Hi Energy Drinks of the year, and red editorial articles called 'Martin McCague \u2013 a re-evaluation', and 'Statsguru \u2013 more than just software'.\" Don't take the mick, Brennan. I dream of becoming an adult one day. If I really mature, they might even let me write for the paper! 45th over: Australia 126-4 (Hussey 5, Haddin 0) I missed that Swann over because I was pawing gently, lovingly, at a poster of Jimmy Anderson. 46th over: Australia 130-4 (Hussey 5, Haddin 4) Anderson beats Haddin with an awayswinger, but then he goes for the magic ball and instead drifts onto the pads. Haddin chips it over midwicket for four. \"What about this quote from 1984 as the title,\" begins Neil Gouldson. \"'The past was dead, the future was unimaginable'? Might be taken a bit out of context, but with a positive spin it kind of sums up my feelings at the end of this glorious series.\" 47th over: Australia 132-4 (Hussey 7, Haddin 4) Hussey has been typically positive in his feet movement against Swann, and he comes down the track to crunch a couple through midwicket. There are 12 overs remaining. 48th over: Australia 135-4 (Hussey 7, Haddin 7) England have a huge shout for caught behind turned down when Hussey chases a wide one from Anderson. His bat definitely hit the ground, but it's hard to be sure either way whether he edged it. England were thinking about a review, but then \u2013 and this is good to see \u2013 both umpires signalled that their 20 seconds (or however long it is) were up. I'm not sure Strauss was going to review it anyway. Hotspot showed nothing, so the decision would not have been overturned. We haven't seen Snicko yet though. 49th over: Australia 139-4 (Hussey 7, Haddin 11) Two very close shaves for Haddin. First he chipped Swann just over Bresnan at mid on, and then he was dropped by Bell at short extra cover. It was an extremely tough chance for Bell, diving forward and trying to scoop his fingers under the ball a few centimetres from the floor. Still, it was technically a dropped catch. I can't remember when Ian Bell last dropped a catch. 50th over: Australia 142-4 (Hussey 8, Haddin 13) Bresnan replaces Anderson, who bowled an exceptional spell of 7-4-11-2. Haddin is duped by a good inswinger but it was swinging down leg. \"Are you not a little worried?\" says Tom Savage. \"If James taught us anything, it's that if we hadn't seen such riches, we could live with being poor. How typical of the English cricket fan in me that the joy of watching the Aussies being beaten like lads in a 1930s borstal is tinged with sadness that it will probably not only never be this good again, but will probably be worse for having tasted this success.\" 51st over: Australia 146-4 (Hussey 12, Haddin 13) Swann drops short and Hussey rocks back to pull behind square for four. 52nd over: Australia 149-4 (Hussey 12, Haddin 16) Haddin drives Bresnan through mid-off for three. Hussey is then beaten by a superb leg-cutter. Seven overs to go. These updates may get shorter and shorter, because I think I might actually be asleep. 53rd over: Australia 152-4 (Hussey 12, Haddin 19) Haddin cuts Swann for three. On the Australian balcony, Steve Smith is having a gnawing zestily at his fingernails. Any body-language experts out there who can tell us what that means? WICKET! Australia 161-5 (Hussey c Pietersen b Bresnan 12) What a gift just before the close. Hussey has cut Bresnan straight to backward point. He didn't get on top of the ball and it flew ast Pietersen, who took a sharp two-handed catch above his head. England are five wickets away from the crushing victory they deserve. 54th over: Australia 161-5 (Haddin 27, Smith 0) \"On the topic of sleep,\" says Amirali Abdullah, \"any chance you might wake to find Australia 3-1 up, and England following on 200 behind?\" Yes, this is the cricket version of Inception. It's called Insertion. We're all about to wake up on November 7 2002; there's a coin landing at the feet of Nasser Hussain and Steve Waugh... 55th over: Australia 165-5 (Haddin 29, Smith 1) Tremlett returns in place of Swann, and his first ball is a preposterous jaffa that beats Haddin outside off stump. Later in the over, Smith is sent back and is barely in the frame when Anderson's throw whizzes just past the stumps. Anderson is an awesome fielder by any standards, never mind those of a fast bowler. \"I'm in Australia at the moment,\" says Tom Fleuriot. \"It's hilarious. Everyone's walking around like they just saw their mum having it off with their best friend.\" 56th over: Australia 171-5 (Haddin 30, Smith 5) Smith plays a cracking cover-drive for four by Bresnan. Australia will hope that, one glorious day, he looks back on this series as Steve Waugh does the 1986-87 Ashes. WICKET! Australia 171-6 (Haddin c Prior b Tremlett 30) This is a snorter from Chris Tremlett. He rams in a superb straight short ball, the line so good that Brad Haddin can't get out of the way, and the ball loops up in the air off the splice, for Matt Prior to take a simple catch. There are 15 balls left today, but England might well take the extra half-hour. WICKET! Australia 171-7 (Johnson b Tremlett 0) Tremlett is on a hat-trick! This is another jaffa: full, straight and ramming into Johnson's off stump. \"What a nut!\" screams Nasser Hussain. Wonderful stuff, and England are going to claim the extra half-hour here. 57th over: Australia 171-7 (Smith 5, Siddle 0) The hat-trick ball is a majestic inswinging yorker, and Siddle does extremely well to jam the ball into his boot. What a storming over from Tremlett, a double-wicket maiden. There are two overs remaining, plus the extra half hour, which the umpires have agreed to give England. 58th over: Australia 172-7 (Smith 5, Siddle 0) Bresnan bowls a relatively anodyne maiden to Smith. Mind you, Michael Holding's over to Geoff Boycott was relatively anodyne in contrast to that last one from Tremlett. \"I am in Gurgaon Delhi interning at this hole,\" says a nameless email. \"I just realised tomorrow is our last date. I miss you so much already. Bye.\" Marry me, nameless one? 59th over: Australia 176-7 (Smith 5, Siddle 4) Tremlett's making the old ball sing. It's doing a bloody falsetto. Siddle is beaten twice and just jabs down on another couple of excellent swinging deliveries. I've definitely woken up now. Who needs Class B drugs when you've got a double-wicket maiden from Chris Tremlett? Siddle then chips an errant delivery for four. So that's the end of the scheduled day's play, but England have been given the extra half-hour. It'll actually be an extra eight overs, unless they hurry through them inside 30 minutes. \"Thinking this through for a moment, you need a title which will appeal to the target market, carry a little bit of whimsical humour, a whiff of nostalgia and a soupcon of wordplay, and which will entice the impulse buyer on the shelf of WH Smiths,\" begins Paul Griffin. \"On that basis, how about: 'This Lot Are Effing Shit'. My agent will be in touch re: royalties.\" 60th over: Australia 176-7 (Smith 5, Siddle 4) Smith defends diligently against Bresnan, who will surely give way to Anderson now. 61st over: Australia 181-7 (Smith 7, Siddle 7) Great shot from Siddle, who blasts a reverse-swinger from Tremlett through the covers for three. Six overs to go. 62nd over: Australia 181-7 (Smith 7, Siddle 7) Bresnan continues and Siddle, pushing around his front pad, chips one a fraction short of Bell, diving forward at short midwicket. A maiden, and there are five overs remaining. 63rd over: Australia 191-7 (Smith 12, Siddle 7) Smith gets down on one knee and slices a cut to third man for four. Tremlett responds by swinging a couple past the edge, the second of which goes through Prior for four byes. Four overs, three wickets; I don't think it's going to happen tonight. 64th over: Australia 198-7 (Smith 19, Siddle 7) Now Anderson does replace Bresnan, and Smith slices a booming drive through the vacant fourth-slip area for four. Bah! Eighteen balls to go. 65th over: Australia 198-7 (Smith 19, Siddle 7) Swann replaces Tremlett. Smith has done well to monopolise the strike, but that's a maiden so now Anderson will have a go at Siddle. 66th over: Australia 208-7 (Smith 19, Siddle 17) Siddle edges Anderson's last delivery just over the slip cordon for four. That was hilarious: they all leapt in unison, even those who were nowhere near it. Even the crowd all jumped up instinctively. 67th over: Australia 213-7 (Smith 23, Siddle 17) That's it. Credit to Smith and Siddle for a proud and defiant partnership that ensures the match will go into a fifth day, but credit mainly to England for another cold, clinical defenestration of Australia. On a flat pitch their bowlers were superb, and they will return tomorrow needing three wickets to complete an emphatic 3-1 victory. Thanks for your emails; morning."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
