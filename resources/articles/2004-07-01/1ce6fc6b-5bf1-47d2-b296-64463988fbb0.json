Speaking at the party's National Policy Forum at Warwick University, Tony Blair warned that the aspirations of ordinary people for a 'decent job, a decent society and decent public services' had been 'neglected and betrayed in the previous two decades of weakness, strife and opposition'. The Labour leadership is bracing itself for a rough ride over schools selection at the forum, which will help in drawing up policy to take to the Labour conference in September. There is considerable grass-roots anger over the extension of city academies and specialist schools, which allow a proportion of pupils to be selected. Sources confirmed that they may have to reassure traditionalists that they are not planning to reintroduce grammar schools by the back door. Without mentioning Iraq in his speech, Blair admitted that the party had come through a difficult period: 'I don't think anyone would dispute we have come through a testing time. We have come through it strengthened.' Blair announced the establishment of a Commission on Women in Work, to be chaired by Baroness Prosser, which will look into the pay gap between men and women. In a speech almost triumphalist in its tone, Blair staked a claim to traditional Labour values and dismissed the idea that he was a closet Tory. 'Because we've run the economy well, worked with business, are tough on law and order and believe in supporting our armed forces, then I must be a Tory in disguise: i.e., if you believe in economic efficiency and taking action on crime, you must be a Tory. It was never really true, of course.' At times using language that evoked the 'permanent revolution' of Trotsky and Mao, he said Labour needed 'permanent policy renewal' to escape the mistakes made by the party when in opposition. 'It is this renewal that continues today, and must continue every day as we remain a party in tune with the aspirations of the hard-working majority in the country.' Blair's speech was preceded by a morale-boosting session from John Prescott, the Deputy Leader. He baited Tory leader Michael Howard for his lacklustre performance in last Tuesday's debate on Iraq. 'You could see the fear in his eyes; he is the walking dead,' he said. The National Policy Forum was set up in 1993 to shift policy making away from the unions. It was intended to end division but a series of votes today will set the leadership against the party. Chief among these is the issue of school selection. Traditionalists are furious about the number of schools that will be able to select pupils by 'aptitude' as announced under the five-year education plan. Others want a commitment on the future of the remaining grammar schools in England and Wales. They want it made easier to trigger ballots for their abolition."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
