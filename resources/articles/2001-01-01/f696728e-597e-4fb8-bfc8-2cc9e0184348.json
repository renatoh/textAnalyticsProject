Brown failed to make a payment of \u00a3250,000 for a 25% stake in the club's parent company, CUFC Holdings Ltd, by Knighton's deadline. Brown, who claimed to have made \u00a36.3m from the sale of a hotel complex in Spain, seems not to be all he was cracked up to be. It appears that he lives in an old people's home in Peebles, where his partner is a janitor; that he has been working as a barman in an Indian restaurant; that he is barred from a Peebles hotel for causing \"serious trouble\"; and that, far from driving a smart BMW, he has a battered old Cavalier. \"This man has caused horrendous embarrassment to me and the club,\" said Knighton, who sold the majority of his stake to the Gibraltarian investment company Mamcarr last week and is himself banned for five years from being a director of any company as a result of financial irregularities. \"I have never been hoodwinked in my life. I usually pride myself on my ability to see straight through people.\" Brown acted as the public face of a consortium which last week announced its takeover of United, six points adrift at the foot of the Football League. A former Partick Thistle season ticket holder, the 47-year-old claimed to have offshore business interests and intended to join the club's new board as commercial director for a two-month trial before paying Knighton for his stake. He sat in the directors' box at Saturday's third-round FA Cup defeat by Arsenal before details of his business background cast doubt over his ability to invest in the club. It emerged that he had failed in a bid to buy Partick in 1998 - he was paraded on the pitch \u00e0 la Knighton at Old Trafford in 1989 - and in attempts to invest in Peebles and Selkirk rugby clubs, despite claiming to have won millions of pounds on the lottery. \"He came to us saying he wanted to invest great sums of money but, when we started discussing it in a bit of detail, he said he wasn't putting forward the money but was proposing a sponsorship scheme backed by friends,\" said the former president of Selkirk, Norman Douglas. \"He told us he drove a top-of-the-range BMW but he turned up to give a presentation in a clapped-out Vauxhall.\" Brown did a four-month spell as commercial manager of the Scottish non-league club Gala Fairydean but that ended in November when club officials became dissatisfied with his performance. \"Brown was never a major player in the buy-out,\" said Knighton, who himself failed to generate the \u00a310m he needed to buy Manchester United from Martin Edwards 11 years ago. \"The main buyer, Mamcarr Investments, paid for 60% of the shares; that was signed and sealed on January 2. Contrary to reports, I have no links with them and they are a very solid, determined business with a lot of enthusiasm for taking Carlisle forward. \"Brown is a different entity. He approached me at a friendly between Carlisle and Gala Fairydean on July 20 and told me he wanted to buy 25% of my shares. He said he had just sold a hotel in Spain for \u00a36.3m and, when we discussed the offer recently, we agreed to give him until February 28 to pay.\" The deadline was brought forward at the weekend. With the cancellation of Brown's bid and Mamcarr retaining an option on a further 15% of CUFC Holdings, Knighton still owns 40% of the club, although he claims a local businessman has expressed interest in his stake. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
