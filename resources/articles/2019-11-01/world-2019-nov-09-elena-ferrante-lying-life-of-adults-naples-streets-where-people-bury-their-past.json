The presence of a bookshop is among the first notable distinctions between Rione Alto, the main location for La Vita Bugiarda Degli Adulti (The Lying Life of Adults), and Rione Luzzatti, the neglected, rundown area where Ferrante\u2019s phenomenally successful quartet of books that began with My Brilliant Friend are believed to have been set. Perched on the highest part of the Vomero hilltop district, for decades Rione Alto was a rural zone, known for cultivating so many vegetables that the few people living there were nicknamed \u201cbroccoli\u201d. Now the area is home to affluent Neapolitans, among them doctors, lawyers and professors, who grew up in places akin to Rione Luzzatti. \u201cThis is where a lot of people from poor districts moved to, many wanting to forget where they came from,\u201d said Luca Di Costanza, who manages Raffaello bookshop. \u201cJust like the father, Andrea, in Ferrante\u2019s new book \u2013 he wants to bury his past.\u201d In her latest novel, Ferrante immediately captivates the reader with the opening line: \u201cTwo years before leaving home, my father told my mother that I was very ugly.\u201d The stinging remark is overheard by the book\u2019s main protagonist, Giovanna, during a discussion between her leftwing parents over her failure to keep up at school, and charts the course of her turbulent adolescence. Set in the 1990s, this is a vivid world typical of Ferrante: of relationships, family divides and the festering emotions of unresolved conflict. \u201cThe main theme is the relationship between children and parents, and how adults use lies in life,\u201d said Di Costanza. \u201cThe lie is not always bad \u2013 maybe it was used to cover up trouble \u2013 but after the child discovers the truth, it gets unleashed in a bad way.\u201d Once again, Ferrante also manages to sweep readers away by depicting Naples in all its charm, contrasts and complexity. \u201cNaples has two souls,\u201d said Di Costanza. \u201cThe true Naples is the fusion of the two souls \u2013 one is the intellectual Naples, the other is the traditional, where people still hold dear traditions, as that\u2019s what gives them safety.\u201d About 30 people crammed into Raffaello\u2019s last Wednesday evening for a Ferrante \u201cvigil\u201d ahead of the release of the Italian version of the book at the turn of midnight. But outside the shop, some people in the area haven\u2019t read Ferrante\u2019s works. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of her on TV, but I don\u2019t have time to read books,\u201d said Maria Arcopinto, who runs a fruit and vegetable stall on Via San Giacomo dei Capri, the street where the fictional Giovanna and her parents live. Carla Santojanni, whose husband grew up in Rione Alto, said: \u201cI saw the TV series [for My Brilliant Friend] and am now curious to read the new book \u2026 especially as I\u2019ve been told that the apartment building I\u2019m about to move into is the one featured in it.\u201d With the new book, to be released in English in June next year, comes the inevitable return of intrigue over the author\u2019s identity: Elena Ferrante is a pseudonym. Via San Giacomo dei Capri is close to Via Gemito, also the name of a book by Domenico Starnone, the husband of Anita Raja, a translator who journalist Claudio Gatti claimed in 2016 is the author. Over in nearby Vomero, which also features in the book, people have a strong suspicion that the writer lives in the neighbourhood and that she may have even signed up as a member of IoCiSto, a bookshop owned by citizens and run by volunteers. \u201cDuring the first year after we opened, a woman came in and asked lots of questions about the shop and the story behind it,\u201d said Alberto Della Sala, the bookshop\u2019s director. \u201cWe believe that it was her.\u201d A corner of IoCiSto is dedicated to Ferrante, and about three dozen copies of La Vita Bugiarda Degli Adulti have sold since Thursday. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot for us and for a book launched midweek,\u201d adds Sala. \u201cWe expect more in the Christmas lead-up. I\u2019ve only read the first few pages, but it is beautiful.\u201d Ferrante\u2019s Neapolitan novels, which told the story of the lifelong friendship and rivalry between two women, sold more than 10m copies around the world, 1.5m in Italy. My Brilliant Friend\u2019s adaptation into a TV series was also a huge success, and a second season covering the second novel is expected to be aired next year. Ferrante\u2019s first five books, beginning with Troubling Love in 1992, attracted a cult following in Italy, but, paradoxically, the author only really started to capture Italian readers after the success of My Brilliant Friend abroad. \u201cI was only encouraged to read it after hearing about it from foreign friends,\u201d said Francesca Iarusso, a PhD student in Naples. \u201cThen I became fascinated. I liked the books because they were very feminine in regards sentiments that aren\u2019t so easily expressed by other authors. As for Ferrante\u2019s identity, I don\u2019t care.\u201d Maurizio Pagano, an author who grew up in Rione Luzzatti, said: \u201cUnfortunately, Italy is a country that doesn\u2019t read much, so Ferrante hasn\u2019t had the same prominence here as she has had abroad.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
