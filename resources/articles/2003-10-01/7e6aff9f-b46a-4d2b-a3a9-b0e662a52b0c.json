Blofeld is an oddity in the world of modern sports broadcasting because he is first and foremost a journalist. He may not be an especially accomplished broadcast journalist - his eccentricity seems too forced and there is something contrived about his whimsical fascination with passing pigeons and red double-decker buses - but at least, in the once great tradition of the BBC and like John Arlott, David Coleman, Peter O'Sullevan and Bill McLaren before him, he understands the craft and discipline that is required of a sports broadcaster. The deep knowledge, too. In recent years, something of a calamity has befallen so much sports broadcasting in this country. Not only is it in thrall to celebrity; it is ruled by a category mistake. The mistake is to believe that recently retired sportsmen or women, fast-tracked into the studio, are alone best placed to commentate on and analyse their sport of expertise. But if this were true then it would follow that, say, only a musician would have the authority to write about music, or a novelist the acumen to review a novel. The art of a good sports broadcaster is, rather like that of a critic, to combine journalistic scepticism with a certain verbal facility. There are excellent sportsmen-turned-broadcasters, such as Andrew Castle (on tennis) and Mark Nicholas (on cricket) but, in the main, most of them aren't much good at all, neither being articulate nor sufficiently knowledgeable enough. To watch Gary Lineker, though himself admirable, lead a half-time discussion during a live BBC broadcast of an England international, especially when Peter Reid and Ian Wright are on the panel, is often to watch the equivalent of a group of mates bantering aimlessly in a pub. These \"experts\", you feel, are too close to the footballers they discuss. It is the same with cricket and indeed with athletics, where Roger Black, as the frontman of the BBC's coverage, presides over what is increasingly beginning to resemble an old boys' club. Black was a decent 400m runner, but, despite his charm and good looks, he seems ill suited to his new role, not least because of a natural unwillingness to offend. British athletics is in decline; the team did not win a single gold medal at the world championships. What has gone wrong? Where is the leadership? Who is to blame for this failure? These are the questions that Black and his team should be seeking to answer, rather than commending, in their awkward way, yet another plucky British loser. The sportswoman most exposed in her role as the BBC's trackside interviewer is Sally Gunnell. I recall, in particular, during last summer's European championships when, in the immediate aftermath of the women's 800m final, she interviewed Kelly Holmes, who had been beaten into third place by Jolanda Ceplak of Slovenia. Holmes was shaken by the ferocity and stamina of the front-running Ceplak. Unprompted by Gunnell, she said: 'At least I know I did it fairly and cleanly, Sally.' I waited for the follow-up question. 'Are you suggesting, Kelly, that the winner isn't clean?' It was never asked. Later, Holmes repeated her remarks; this time, they were followed up, forcing Ceplak to deny that she had taken performance-enhancing drugs. The burnish on her medal had begun to fade, and Gunnell had missed her story. But she was less culpable than the celebrity-fixated executives of BBC sport who had put her, and others like her, trackside in the first place. I first met George Plimpton in the summer of 2000. We were 'delegates' at a self-styled conversazione on the history of the essay, which was held at Casa Ecco, the grand Italian home of the philanthropist Drue Heinz that overlooks Lake Como. The other delegates - the academics Tom Paulin, Lorna Sage and Christopher Ricks, and the journalists Simon Jenkins, Lewis Lapham and Paul Johnson - were an intimidating and rather self-important bunch, with a tendency towards ostentatious displays of knowledge. But there was nothing remotely grand about Plimpton, if one discounted the natural aristocracy of his birth. The son of a successful New York lawyer and diplomat, Plimpton - who died, aged 76, at the end of last month - was born into privilege. Inherited wealth liberated him from all mundane constraint; but, at the same time, he never stopped working. Yet work, for Plimpton, often meant play, and he was one of America's most diligent and enthusiastic editors as well as an excellent journalist whose inexhaustible curiosity took him all over the world, often in search of wildlife and rare birds. For 50 years, he edited the Paris Review, a small circulation yet influential New York-based literary journal that published many of the world's finest writers. He was also a pioneering sportswriter, who wrote about sport through active participation: he played quarterback for the Detroit Lions and golf on the US PGA tour; he boxed, he fought with bulls in Spain, pitched baseballs, drove racing cars and he even performed on a high-wire trapeze. He then wrote about these experiences with authority and style. There was nothing, it seemed, that Plimpton would not try, because, as he told me during that long summer weekend on the banks of Lake Como, he was compelled by the drama and intensity of the sporting life and wanted to experience something of that drama directly for himself. He was ringside (with his old friend Norman Mailer) in Kinshasa when George Foreman took on Muhammad Ali in the 'Rumble in the Jungle'. So it was little surprise, when I contacted Plimpton to ask if he would become the first contributor to our new 'Heroes and Villains' series, that he should choose to celebrate George Foreman, whose spirit and fortitude he never ceased to admire. Right up until his death, on 25 September, George Plimpton continued to work, completing the 50th anniversary issue of the Paris Review, as well as the piece that we are honoured to publish in this magazine. He was a man of great natural elegance and charm, who wrote so well about sport because sport was not all he knew. Second thoughts: Laughing stock When did David Seaman become DAVID SEAMAN? When did he cease to be the reserved, shorthaired Arsenal and England goalkeeper and become the peculiar pony-tailed creature that he is today, an habitu\u00e9 of Hello and other such celebrity magazines? Former Arsenal teammates have suggested that Seaman began to change after Euro '96, a tournament at which he made several spectacular penalty saves. From then on, they say, he became noticeably more ruthless in his pursuit of wealth; certainly, he seldom gave interviews during his final years at Arsenal - unless, like many footballers, he was paid for his spoken words. But there he is, today, a star panelist on BBC1's They Think It's All Over doing exactly what he does best - laughing a great deal and getting well paid for saying nothing of substance at all. Don't you just love him?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
