His pitch was simple. On the one hand, Brussels' obsession with regulation meant the whole EU was being left behind in a vital area of science, while on the other a global Luddism was depriving millions of the advantages that GM foods could bring. GM foods mean less pesticide! More nature reserves! And, more seriously, life-changing benefits for generations of children with vitamin A deficiency who are currently denied genetically modified \"golden\" rice. Like both sides in this long debate, he overstates his argument and so compounds the stalemate. It is true that last year both Monsanto and the German firm BASF retreated from Europe, complaining of the stranglehold of regulation. Draft legislation allowing individual countries some freedom to make their own decisions on GM crops has been on the table for three years: few governments are willing to challenge their citizens' scepticism, either about the science or the involvement of big business (although that may be about to change if GM is included in the next round of EU-US trade talks). Yesterday Mr Paterson again argued that GM was just another step in the long march of agricultural improvement, on a par with better animal husbandry and selective plant breeding. But ignoring the substantive difference between exploiting a natural resistance to a disease, and the introduction of an alien gene to provide that protection, merely makes voters more suspicious of the science and the people promoting it. That is why modified \"golden\" rice \u2013 where beta-carotene has been introduced so that people for whom rice is a staple get vitamin A \u2013 has taken a decade to be given authorisation. It is individual Asian governments that have insisted on taking it slowly, not a handful of European nostalgists yearning for a prelapsarian age. But being cautious about GM means being serious about other ways of tackling the population explosion which, it is anticipated, will demand a 60% increase in food production over the next 40 years. GM may, indeed, one day be part of the answer. More traditional science, using genetics, certainly will be. But the bigger answers lie in asking bigger questions about the politics, as campaigners argued at the G8 earlier this week. As Europe proved in the 40 years after 1965, when agricultural production doubled, it's not only science that makes a difference. No amount of chemical fertilisers would have done so much if there had not also been agricultural education, investment in roads, storage and markets, and access to improved seed \u2013 as well as a political economy that prioritised food production. These are at the heart of a global sustainable agriculture. Genetic engineering is no substitute."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
