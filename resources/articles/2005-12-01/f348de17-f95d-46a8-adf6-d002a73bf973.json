A jury would convict a murderer only to hear the judge say that he has a string of previous convictions. The jurors, the journalists and the victim's family ask why no one got to him before he killed, and then it all comes out. He was halfway to madness when he was let out of prison, but the governor didn't alert anyone else. The nurse at the psychiatric unit he stumbled into was scared witless but could not be bothered to tell the police or probation service that a dangerously demented man was loose in their patch. Not that it would have mattered if she had because the police and probation were barely on speaking terms. The coppers thought probation officers were bleeding hearts in dungarees from the Monsoon sale, and the probation officers thought the coppers were the local branch of the BNP. The last big case I can remember to fit that pattern was the trial of Stuart Campbell in 2002 for the murder of his 15-year-old niece Danielle Jones. The police made the overdue discovery that Campbell had an old conviction for abducting a 14-year-old girl. During the trial women came forward to describe how he had abused them. It was all too late for Danielle. Her parents did not find out the truth about Uncle Stuart until after he had murdered her. I am not saying there haven't been similar cases since, but they are far less frequent than they used to be. Last year the Probation Service supervised 12,600 'high risk' or 'extremely high risk' criminals. Prosecutors charged a mere 79 of them - 0.6 per cent -with committing a new offence while they were under supervision. It may be that the police have arrested others since the figures were collected, and I'd put money on offenders getting away with crimes the police knew nothing about. Still, the success in controlling serious offenders remains a formidable achievement that has astonished those who once thought the phrase 'criminal justice system' was a dismal joke. The Chief Inspector of Probation Rod Morgan looked at police and probation in 2003 and said they were 'collaborating to an impressive degree scarcely imaginable as recently as a few years ago'. New Labour deserves huge credit. It ordered each of the 42 police force regions in England and Wales to pull together detectives and probation, social and mental health workers to keep an eye on potential killers. Bureaucracy being the way it is a horribly obscure name - 'multi-agency public protection panels' or 'MAPPPs' - had to be invented for the new boards. But a probation officer who works on one in the north of England told me his colleagues have a clear-eyed view of what they need to do. A typical case on his books is a man who treats his partner with the utmost brutality. He beats her and stuffs keys down her throat but she refuses to press charges. Members of the panel talk to her and him and let them know that the authorities are watching. The police highlight their street so any 999 call from their house or nearby is a priority. In his saner moments, the man can't escape the thought that there are a lot of people waiting for the chance to arrest him. It is difficult and expensive work. The authorities are containing sadists, rapists and criminals out of their minds on drugs. Yet the evidence shows that because of what Tony Blair and his Home Secretaries have done there are children who are growing-up without being raped and adults walking the streets who would otherwise be dead. It is worth going into politics to be able to say 'I accomplished that'. Naturally, having created a system that works, New Labour is going to destroy it. The government plans to abolish the probation service. In its place will be a phoney market where private companies and religious charities will bid against existing staff for contracts to supervise criminals. Much the same privatisation process threatens the unity of the National Health Service, but New Labour is carrying its market dogma to an extreme in crime fighting. I think I can safely say it is dogma because ministers cannot offer a shred of proof that they have thought through their policy. For months now, Harry Fletcher of the probation workers' union has been asking the Home Office to produce its 'business case', the tightly argued justification that should show how the reforms would reduce offending. He has tried everything, including the Freedom of Information Act, but not a squeak has come out of Whitehall. I know that the reason for the silence is that no justification exists. With unforgivable recklessness, Charles Clarke is playing with people's lives because Tony Blair is telling him to privatise, not because his civil servants have worked out that privatisation will be a better way to protect the public. At present judges and magistrates sit on probation committees to see whether their sentences are having the desired effect. This is all to the good and a part of the modern movement to get the different branches of the criminal justice system to cooperate. The judiciary is now telling MPs that it will pull out if, say, Group 4 wins the contract to run probation in the West Midlands. Private companies have a legal duty to maximise profits for shareholders, and no judge could help them do it without compromising his or her independence. These are not nit-picking objections. What will happen when a private company that runs prisons also gets control of probation work? Probation officers have a duty to provide impartial advice to the courts on the best sentence for a convict. For a profit-maximising company, however, the sentence that will generate the most revenue for their shareholders is a prison sentence in one of their expensive jails. Let the profit motive in, and you risk turning Britain into a European version of the United States, where the penal lobby is almost as fearsome a political operator as the National Rifle Association. The Californian prison officers union threw millions at legislators in the late 1990s to encourage them to keep the state's vast prison system full to capacity. Across the Deep South, private prison companies fund politicians who order the construction of more private prisons. The standard objection to my argument is that the most important debate in British politics is about what happened to the money New Labour put into the public services. Tony Blair rightly believes centre-left government will not survive if the voters think ministers are wasting their taxes. I concede that in theory there could be brilliant arguments for involving the private sector and improving efficiency. In practice, we are not hearing arguments brilliant or otherwise. There is a wildness about the last years of Tony Blair, and a manic institutional Maoism running through his Government. Downing Street is demanding privatisation without a thought for the consequences because it seems like a radical way to defuse a growing political threat. Yet in the case of the criminal justice system, private computer companies and management consultants were the very people who wasted the public's money in the first place. They persuaded gullible civil servants to spend hundreds of millions on doomed projects such as the probation service's Case Record and Management System, which promised to provide accurate intelligence on offenders and assessments of the risks they were likely to pose. Alas, the software refused to recognise aliases or villains whose first names echoed their surnames. This caused terrible trouble in Wales. 'We've got loads of Jon Joneses and Dai Davises and Tom Thomases down here,' a Pontypool probation officer told me years ago. 'Every time we put their names in, it throws a wobbly.' It is still not working properly, and probation officers who want to log in without a glitch have to come to work early or leave late. The commentariat has hailed the new Tory leader's plan to detach the Prime Minister from his party by voting through his 'reforms'. If David Cameron wants to tie the Conservatives to policies that will probably get people killed, let him. I don't think it will help them regain power."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
