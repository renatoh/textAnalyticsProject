Video footage circulated on the internet of an incident towards the end of QPR's 1-0 victory in which it has been suggested Terry calls the home defender a \"fucking black cunt\" as he retreats into his own half of the pitch. Terry denies it and issued a statement on Sunday evening in which he claimed viewers had \"leapt to the wrong conclusions about the context of what I was seen to be saying to Anton Ferdinand\". Terry said he had been responding to accusations from the opposing centre-half that he had used racist language. \"I thought Anton was accusing me of using a racist slur against him,\" he said. \"I responded aggressively, saying I never used that term.\" The key part of the footage, where the England captain said he shouted \"Oi, Anton, I never said \u2026\", is obscured by Ashley Cole walking across the camera shot. The furore over the incident, and a fractious fixture which saw Chelsea reduced to nine men before the interval, is understood to have spilled into the tunnel after the final whistle, with angry altercations involving players from both sides. Terry and the home goalkeeper, Paddy Kenny, continued arguments that had sparked on the pitch, and other players are believed to have become involved in what is a narrow corridor outside the dressing rooms. Terry said he had spoken to Ferdinand once tempers had calmed \"and there was no problem between us\", saying the incident had been \"a misunderstanding\". Yet the notion that the pair departed amicably has been rejected by sources at QPR. The club have declined to comment publicly on the issue and Ferdinand \u2013 normally a keen twitterer \u2013 has maintained silence. The Rangers players were given the day off on Monday after their victory but will report back to their Harlington training centre on Tuesday morning. The club made preliminary contact with him by texton Monday, with the defender \u2013 brother of the former England captain, Rio Ferdinand \u2013 and one of his representatives to meet Warnock after training to discuss whether the club will ask the FA to investigate. It is understood the player and the club were minded to pursue the matter, though the 26-year-old asked to sleep on the matter before making a final decision. Should a complaint be made and if Terry is found guilty, any charge would inevitably have serious repercussions for the 30-year-old's position as England captain. The FA declined to comment but does technically have it within its power to investigate, even if no formal complaint is made. Terry was due to make a personal appearance at the opening of a pet shop in Surbiton on Monday but withdrew late from the event, leaving around 100 supporters disappointed. Meanwhile, the FA is reviewing the post-match conduct of the Chelsea manager, Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, after he confronted the referee, Chris Foy, in the tunnel. Onlookers described the Portuguese's language as \"industrial\", with Villas-Boas subsequently admitting he had been \"very aggressive\" with the referee as he complained at perceived inconsistencies in the official's display. The Chelsea manager claimed Foy had \"lost it\" and was \"card happy\" towards his team, comments that could prompt the FA to impose either a fine or touchline suspension. It remains to be seen whether Foy's match report includes mention either of the players' altercations in the tunnel or Villas-Boas's reaction after the final whistle. The referee sent off Didier Drogba, who apologised to his team-mates in the changing room post-match, for a two-footed lunge at Adel Taarabt, as well as Jos\u00e9 Bosingwa for a professional foul on Shaun Wright-Phillips, and booked a further seven visiting players. \"I thought he reffed it superbly,\" said the QPR midfielder Shaun Derry. \"These big players have a knack of persuading refs to make different decisions but the ref was very strong. The sendings off were the right decisions, and most of the yellow cards were for Chelsea players, and I felt we kept our heads. \"We wanted to unnerve them and put them under pressure in the right areas, and that plan came off. What do you do? Do you stand off these players and let them dictate, or do you get amongst them and mix it with them? I don't think we were vicious in any way or over-aggressive in anything we did. But these top players aren't used to losing to teams of our stature. Perhaps it hurt them because they showed that even the best players can lose their heads.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
