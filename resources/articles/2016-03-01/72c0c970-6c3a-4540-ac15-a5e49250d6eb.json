Football has often tested Niasse\u2019s patience and the move to Goodison Park has been no exception. The striker\u2019s father, Makhone, refused to allow his youngest son to pursue a professional career until the age of 17 because of the financial burden on the family and concern at the prospects of success. His first chance to impress on the European stage, at the Norwegian side Brann, resulted in misery and a swift return to Senegal. Having realised his dream move to England on 1 February via successful spells in Russia and Turkey the 25-year-old has made three substitute appearances totalling 25 minutes for Roberto Mart\u00ednez\u2019s team. Work permit issues, a wrist injury and a lack of match fitness after last playing for Lokomotiv in December have contributed to the false start. Last Saturday Niasse was introduced with 14 minutes remaining against West Ham United and with 10-man Everton leading 2-0. The eventual 3-2 defeat brought scathing criticism of the striker, though more was reserved for Mart\u00ednez\u2019s costly decision to withdraw Aaron Lennon for him and the latest evidence of Everton\u2019s inability to defend an advantage. With Farhad Moshiri attending his first game on Saturday since the Premier League approved the billionaire\u2019s purchase of a 49.9% stake in Everton, the FA Cup quarter-final against Chelsea offers Niasse, Mart\u00ednez and co a perfect moment to respond to the doubters. \u201cI am a fighter,\u201d Niasse says. \u201cFootball is not easy and just getting a professional contract means people must respect you because you have something. Even if it\u2019s one quality, you have it. When I feel very good, when I feel ready to play, the fans will see someone who always wants to have the ball, someone who always wants to win, someone who always wants to run. This kind of player is someone who is focused on fighting every time he has the shirt and is on the pitch. I am going to fight.\u201d The rush to judge Niasse after three cameo displays for Everton is in contrast to his upbringing in Ouakam, where the striker spent most of his adolescence fighting resistance from his father over his chosen profession. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say I was a bad boy but I was not good. My dad never slapped me but my big brothers always slapped me and told me not to play football. Whenever I had five minutes I would go out and you would not see me for three or four hours because I was 12 years old playing football with guys who were 20. I had a lot of leg injuries, I broke my leg twice and still have a lot of scars, and my dad had to spend a lot of money he couldn\u2019t afford at the hospital. He had a lot of problems with me. After one time in hospital he said: \u2018After this, if you start to play football again I will kill you.\u2019 But I never thought I would do anything else in my life than play football. \u201cI am from a poor family in Senegal. I have five brothers and two sisters and I was the craziest. My dad was a bus driver and didn\u2019t think I could make a life out of football or that it would support us in life. He thought if you wanted a family you had to go to school, learn something and try to get a normal job. It was only when my brother [Baye Ibrahima] went to Nancy Lorraine in 2007 that my dad realised this could be a career for us and started to let me play. In my first year I was selected for the under-18s of the national team. I had played two games in 2009, I was just starting to be a real professional, when my dad passed away. Life became more complicated for me after that.\u201d Niasse is speaking in fluent English as he attends a training session with Everton in the Community\u2019s Down\u2019s syndrome football team. His wife, Sirra, is from Gambia but has lived in Manchester for almost a decade and the striker travelled regularly to the city during his 18 months with Lokomotiv. He credits his language skills, however, to the response to a problematic spell at Brann, where injuries limited Niasse to three substitute outings in six months. \u201cWhenever we had English at school I would go off and play football so I never had a good relationship with my English teachers,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought English was not for me but when I went to Norway I was so bad at English I couldn\u2019t speak to anyone. When I went back to Senegal, I realised I needed to learn if I wanted to make it as a footballer so I got out all of my old books from school and started again. Then I met my wife, who speaks Senegalese and English very well, and it became much easier.\u201d It was Niasse\u2019s form in this season\u2019s Europa League that alerted Mart\u00ednez to his potential as a forward or a winger. Tottenham Hotspur, Manchester United and Newcastle United also monitored a striker who, despite his quiet introduction at Goodison, was named the Russian Premier League\u2019s player of the year for 2015. And he could have been lining up against Everton on Saturday had Chelsea not dispensed with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s services. \u201cMy manager told me Mourinho was interested,\u201d Niasse says. \u201cHe said Mourinho liked the way I play and had been looking at me since I was in Turkey [with Akhisar Belediyespor]. He was very interested in me for this last transfer window but then he was sacked.\u201d Everton must hope his successor, Guus Hiddink, does not destroy their FA Cup ambition as he did in 2009.
