Not only has a large fuel can dropped off those tables, with rationing introduced last week; so has a once plentiful basket of fruit and veg. Iran's central bank says inflation is running at 14%, but the real figure could be double that. Unemployment could also be running as high as 30%. No surprise, then, that a group of 60 economists has written to the president, blaming his mismanagement for the country's economic woes. All this, plus the torching of petrol stations, has damaged Mr Ahmadinejad's reputation as a champion of the poor, dented the authority of the hardline factions in the revolutionary guard and harmed the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. At this rate, Mr Ahmadinejad may struggle to rebuild his political authority, let alone get re-elected. Supporters of stronger sanctions on Iran may be tempted to think that international pressure is having this effect. Economic sanctions have already been imposed on Iran for refusing to halt its programme of uranium enrichment. Now a bill proposed by a bipartisan panel in the US House of Representatives would reduce the country's access to imported petrol. One of the biggest oil producers, Iran's lack of refining capacity means it still has to import more than half of its petrol. So Mr Ahmadinejad may have imposed petrol rationing as a pre-emptive measure to guard against tightening of the economic noose. Those negotiations with Iran on its nuclear programme are nearing a critical stage. The latest offer represents a compromise by the group of nations (including Britain and the US) that are engaged in negotiations with Iran: a freeze on new UN sanctions in return for a freeze on all further development of Tehran's enrichment programme. This would allow Iran to keep spinning its 3,000 centrifuges, which refine uranium hexafluoride gas, while talks take place on stopping the whole programme. There is slight cause for hope: Iran said it would answer the International Atomic Energy Agency's outstanding questions about the last two decades of its nuclear programme. If the current diplomatic initiative breaks down, and a third and tighter set of economic sanctions are introduced, pressure will grow to bomb Iran. Washington is already a reluctant partner in the negotiations, and even the Israeli left regards the Iranian nuclear programme as an existential threat. As the consequences of an air strike on Iran's nuclear bunkers are too awful to contemplate, all effort has to be channelled into keeping diplomacy on track. This is going to require time and a steady nerve."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
