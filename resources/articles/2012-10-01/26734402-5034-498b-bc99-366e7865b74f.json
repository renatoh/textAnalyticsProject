The Grade I-listed building, which has three arches and views of Buckingham Palace and Trafalgar Square, has reportedly been bought for about \u00a360m by Rafael Serrano. Serrano, who recently built the Bulgari Hotel in Knightsbridge, acquired Admiralty Arch on a 125-year lease with an explicit condition that bars it from being converted into apartments or a single home, the Financial Times reports. The deal, to be confirmed on Thursday morning, is part of a cost-cutting programme to force government departments to rationalise their property portfolios. The arch was completed in 1912 after King Edward VII ordered that it built as a commemoration of his mother, Queen Victoria. A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said: \"Leasing Admiralty Arch will preserve the heritage of the building, provide options for increasing public access, and offer value for money for the taxpayer.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
