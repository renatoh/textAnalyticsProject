In a new appeal, the National Childbirth Trust (NCT) urged the prime minister and his deputy not to squeeze maternity and paternity pay along with other benefits, as the financial anxiety could cause lasting harm to both parents and children. It comes after the chancellor, George Osborne, last week predicted there would have to be another \u00a312bn of cuts to benefits after the next election, adding to fears that the years of real-term cuts to welfare payments are set to continue. As part of his plan, he wants to bring in an overall cap on total government spending on benefits, from which pensions will be exempted, but not maternity and paternity pay. Appealing to Cameron and Clegg in their roles as fathers, the NCT said they should both understand the value of the first thousand days of parenthood. It said the coalition has made real progress by allowing parents to share their leave after the birth of a child, but this will not be meaningful unless parents can afford to take the time off to spend with their newborns. \"Leading child health experts worldwide agree that care given during this life stage has more influence on a child's future than any other time,\" the letter from its chief executive, Belinda Phipps, said. \"Yet for many families this can also be a time of stress and it can put families under real financial pressure to meet the needs of their new baby. The struggle to make ends meet may put strain on a couple's relationship and force parents back to work earlier than they planned. Financial anxieties can increase the risk of postnatal depression for either parent, and relationship breakdown. Both lead to poorer physical and mental health outcomes for all family members.\" New mothers receive 90% of their salary for the first six weeks of maternity leave and \u00a3136.78 for the next 33 weeks, while fathers get the same amount for two weeks. However, increasing it by just 1% in line with other benefits amounts to a \u00a34-a-week cut in real terms \u2013 about \u00a3156 for a mother who takes the maximum of 39 weeks' leave. Phipps said: \"NCT asks the government to recognise the importance of the first thousand days of parenthood by reconsidering the decision to put maternity and paternity pay inside the benefits cap, and increase it at a level which matches the cost of living. The Treasury confirmed maternity and paternity pay will be included in the welfare cap, which will start in 2015."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
