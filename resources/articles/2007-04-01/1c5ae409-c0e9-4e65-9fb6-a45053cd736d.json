Jack Straw told MPs that ministers were \"uncomfortable\" at the high levels of payment. The current regime obliges the government to reimburse the firm for culling healthy birds to prevent diseases spreading despite the publication of an inquiry detailing poor maintenance and waste disposal at the Suffolk plant. Investigators failed to conclusively identify the source of February's outbreak in their final report for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). But it said the \"most plausible\" source of infection was meat imported from Hungary, where Bernard Matthews also has farms. The Food Standards Agency said last month that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute the company. Peter Ainsworth, the shadow environment secretary, said: \"Bearing in mind that there must have been a serious failure of biosecurity at the Bernard Matthews plant, many people will be astonished that no one will be held responsible for the outbreak. Instead the company will receive \u00a3589,356.89 in compensation.\" Chris Huhne, the Liberal Democrat environment spokesman, added: \"Giving over taxpayers' money will cause anger unless the business is held to account for its lapses.\" Defra said that a working group was set up in late 2005 in the wake of the swine fever and foot and mouth outbreaks to examine the payment issue. The review is looking at practice in other countries, such as Spain, where farmers are offered subsidised premiums to encourage them to take out private insurance. Some 159,000 healthy turkeys at the Bernard Matthews farm in Holton were slaughtered to ensure the H5N1 virus could not spread. The firm will be reimbursed between \u00a33 and \u00a34 per bird, depending on age. While it is not clear how the disease spread, inspectors found that gulls were able to feed on scrap meat and that polythene bags which had apparently contained meat and still held waste liquid were left in uncovered bins and could be blown across the site. They also noted that the disease outbreak was confined to a single shed which was in a poor state of maintenance, allowing access for rodents. Investigators described the outbreak as a \"very unlikely occurrence and an isolated event\" and said that in other regards the firm practised good biosecurity measures. Ben Bradshaw, the animal health minister, said: \"Although we cannot be sure how the outbreak happened, this episode reflects the need for constant vigilance.\" Debby Reynolds, chief veterinary officer, said: \"The outbreak in Suffolk appears to be the outcome of a series of normally low probability circumstances.\" Bernard Matthews said Defra's final report was inconclusive about the cause of avian flu and called for more testing of wild birds in the UK. \"The avian flu outbreak has cost our business millions of pounds.\" The Transport and General Workers' union called on the government to compensate Bernard Matthews workers who were laid off due to the bird flu outbreak."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
