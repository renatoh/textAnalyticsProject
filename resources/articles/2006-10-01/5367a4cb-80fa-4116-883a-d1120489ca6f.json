The bucktoothed boy from the Black Country started his career in panto (oh yes he did), charming audiences with his eccentric dancing and silly walks, then won more fans on TV, becoming something of a fixture on Saturday Night At the Palladium. In 1974, his routine at the Royal Variety Performance reportedly had the Queen Mother wiping away tears of laughter. When he died in 1986, after four decades in the saddle, the Stage described him as the backbone of the light-entertainment profession, a man who never did a bad show. His old friend Roy Hudd remembers him in Talk Amongst Yourselves: The Billy Dainty Story (11.30am, Radio 4). Elsewhere, the Afternoon Play (2.15pm, Radio 4) is the story of \"one woman's journey of spiritual discovery in a southern Indian ashram\". But don't worry - it's a comedy. Eve has travelled to the ashram following the death of her parents, who married there in the 1970s. A cynical, money-minded advertising executive, she is looking not for enlightenment, but for the documents that will let her get her hands on Mum and Dad's money. And she's in a hurry. Does the term \"culture clash\" spring to mind? Madeleine Brolly stars in Cats and Monkeys, by Catherine Shepherd."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
