Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, who are both official advisers to the president, had joined him for a conversation inside a building straddling the line between the two Korean states. She had earlier said she would cross the border into North Korea, if invited. The president\u2019s daughter, who had travelled with him after being by his side during the G20 summit in Japan, was also in the spotlight after the release of footage showing her awkwardly attempting to join in a conversation between Theresa May, Emmanuel Macron and Christine Lagarde. The video, released by Macron\u2019s office on Instagram, prompted ridicule from political opponents and others, with many picking up on the look on Lagarde\u2019s face when Trump tried to enter the conversation. The New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted: \u201cIt may be shocking to some, but being someone\u2019s daughter actually isn\u2019t a career qualification. \u201cIt hurts our diplomatic standing when the president phones it in and the world moves on. The US needs our president working the G20. Bringing a qualified diplomat couldn\u2019t hurt either.\u201d Some commentators remarked on the extent of the role played by Ivanka Trump at the G20, where she spoke to the media after her father\u2019s meetings with the Indian and Japanese leaders and also appeared prominently in official leaders\u2019 photographs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
