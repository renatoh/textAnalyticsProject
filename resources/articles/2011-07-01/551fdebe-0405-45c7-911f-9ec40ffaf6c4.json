They sang together: trilling, whistling phrases stolen from other birds and sounds from the world around them with that special starling twist which makes mimicry a creative act. Then one of the birds flew off, leaving the other three on the wire staring in the direction it had flown. They stared together, still, wrapped in concentration. Late sunlight glinted off the iridescent green and purple polka-dotted sheen of their feathers. The starlings didn't move or make a sound, they were watching, holding on to what they were watching just as tightly as the wire they perched on. These last few have been days to hold on to: bright sunshine through fat-bottomed clouds; ringlet butterflies flickering over flowering grasses; yellow-and-black-banded cinnabar moth caterpillars twitching as they spun threads to tie themselves to ragwort; bright pink lip-gloss heads of pyramidal orchids \u2013 these things once observed becoming dearly held. I watched the three starlings watching as I watched recently the drawings of botanical artist Catharine \"Kitty\" Nicholson (Obituary, 22 June) reveal a world few observe with such passion. Her drawings of sticks, leaf mould, grasses, oak galls and flailed hedges are extraordinary acts. They are existential \u2013 a holding on to the beauty of Nature in the face of death. They are political, spiritual acts \u2013 art communicating the significance of ephemeral and overlooked things to a world which couldn't care less. When we hold on to what we observe as if it really matters, as if our lives depended on it, we have to give something too. As the poet Rainer Maria Rilke said: \"The more looked-at world wants to be nourished by love.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
