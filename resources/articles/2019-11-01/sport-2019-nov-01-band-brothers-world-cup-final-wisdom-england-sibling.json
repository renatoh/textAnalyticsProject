People always asked why he was so good and, yes he had the talent and ability, but it was his mind that set him apart from everyone, and why he has gone on to achieve what he has. He is very focused and he likes things to be clean! He even has a hoover in his car, at the first sign of mud he gets it out and it\u2019s gone. He\u2019s got a dog but it\u2019s the most perfect dog you will ever see! We weren\u2019t really competitive, we\u2019ve just always really got on, but being the older brother, when I started out playing rugby league, he came along \u2013 a four-year-old playing under sevens. Playing age group rugby league he always played the age above himself, simply because he needed a challenge. When he played against Wigan St Pats, who are renowned for always having the best teams, he still scored seven tries playing the age above! I sent him a message straight after the All Blacks game on the family WhatsApp group. I just said what an unbelievable achievement to do what you have done. He responded straight after the match with: \u201cThank you, we have given ourselves an opportunity, that is all.\u201d I found that incredible after such a big win against the world\u2019s best team; it\u2019s probably testament to the mindset Eddie and the coaching group have gotten these players into. The last thing I would say to G before the game would be \u2026 Be Yourself, Back Yourself, Fuck It, something we spoke a lot about together last year at Leicester and I\u2019m sure it will be written on his hand somewhere for the final. Tom Youngs, 32, Leicester Tigers\u2019 hooker and captain and elder brother of Ben, 30, the England scrum-half Ben was pretty cheeky when he was growing up. He didn\u2019t enjoy the farm so he left me to do most of that and spent most of his time kicking a rugby ball around in the garden with our cousin, Monty, both of them wearing rugby tops and pretending to kick the winning goal. But seriously, I am so so proud of what he has done. He was always destined to be an England player. He wasn\u2019t the biggest but it was his speed, he would score nine tries in a match. He was always one step in front of everyone and he could read the game so well. He was always the standout player, scoring a miracle try of some sort! There has been a lot of FaceTiming and texts, we\u2019ve spoken two to three times a week while he\u2019s been in Japan. We talk about everything, rugby chat, family chat, but, no, there\u2019s been no talk about tractors! Bendoesn\u2019t even know what we do on the farm at this time of year! Because we do the same job, we\u2019re professional rugby players, and internationals, I know what he\u2019s going through. He can talk to me about things that are going on that he can\u2019t with other people. Speaking to him the other day, the players just really want to finish the job. I was telling him to just enjoy the week, enjoy the occasion, it\u2019s going to go in a flash and you might never experience this again. It\u2019s a once in a lifetime opportunity. Dad is out there but mum doesn\u2019t really like watching the games live so she is looking after Ben\u2019s kids so his wife, Charlotte, can go to Japan. I\u2019m going to watch it in the morning before our game, but I\u2019ve got to keep a lid on the emotions because otherwise I\u2019ll be exhausted and we need a win too. If I was there I would want to tell him how amazingly proud the whole family are of him. Everything that he has achieved is more than we could ever have imagined already. Think of all the sacrifices you have made over the past four years for this and enjoy this moment. It\u2019s very, very special \u2013 take it all in. I can\u2019t tell you how much I will celebrate if we both win on Saturday. Marcus Watson, 28, Wasps wing, Olympic silver medallist and elder brother of Anthony, 25, England\u2019s right wing Well, the brotherly competition worked out pretty well for Anthony! I guess we were both pretty competitive \u2013 all three of us \u2013 because we\u2019ve got the youngest one, Callum, as well. Anthony always used to be that kid who when he would lose he would cry no matter what. I remember my dad would beat him at races and stuff when we were young and he would cry so much. Now it comes out in a different way. You don\u2019t see many tears but he still really hates losing at anything, literally anything. When I was in England Under-18s or 20s and he was in Under-16s you always picture what things will be like in the future and to be honest, I thought we would play together for England! When I got into the full-time academy the coaches started to give me a bit of banter that Anthony was coming up and going to be better than me. I thought, well, it\u2019s just banter, but he has ended up doing pretty well. We have both done OK but despite the silver medal if he wins the World Cup he\u2019s got bragging rights! When I was about 17 or 18 I knew Anthony was going to be a similar sort of player to me and then you look at his frame and he\u2019s a lot bigger than me and it was then I realised, he\u2019s going to be a pretty serious rugby player. I\u2019ve FaceTimed him earlier this week and he texted me on Tuesday saying, \u201cwe\u2019ve got to try to get you to Japan\u201d. I messaged him back, saying: \u201cThe Wasps team\u2019s already been announced for this weekend, so I think we\u2019re going to struggle.\u201d I said we should start a tweet #getmarcustojapan. And then it happened and thanks to the club I\u2019m here! We\u2019re both quite relaxed, but I know that he\u2019s as switched on as you can get. I\u2019ve been thinking about what I will hopefully say to him when they win. But beforehand? He will understand the magnitude of the game so for me it would be more about reminding him about the reason he started playing the game in the first place, because he enjoyed it. Try your best to enjoy the situation. Don\u2019t let it pass you by because these opportunities don\u2019t come around too often. Tom Cowan-Dickie 28, Cornish Pirates hooker and elder brother of Luke, 26, England\u2019s replacement hooker All my life everyone wants to talk about Luke! We were pretty normal as brothers I think, we fought a bit, argued but we would always be there for each other. We must be pretty similar and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve ended up moving into the same positions on the pitch, from back-row to loosehead and then to hooker but no, he didn\u2019t take my position. We were moved there by different people over the years. Some might say we\u2019re pretty similar as people too, although I like to think I\u2019m the nicer one \u2026 some might disagree! We\u2019ve both done a few trips out with Dad [Adam, a deep-sea fisherman] but, to answer the question, we definitely didn\u2019t learn anything from handling slippery fish that was any use when it comes to throwing the ball into the lineout in the wet! How would I describe him in a few words? Confident, a winner, good at everything he does, multi-talented at sports. He was very annoying! When he was playing under-16 and under-18 level, some of the things that he could do for a front-row forward, the skills that he had, I knew then the kid could be special as a rugby player. We play a lot of Xbox and we\u2019ve been chatting on that while he\u2019s been in Japan. He\u2019s really good at that too. At one point he was No 1 in the world on Call of Duty, search and destroy. Everything he picks up, he does well at. We\u2019re playing on Friday night in Nottingham so I\u2019ll be watching the match in the hotel on Saturday morning. If I was there, I would just tell him: do what you do. Enjoy it, don\u2019t worry about it \u2013 at the end of the day rugby is rugby whatever happens. Do what you can and we will proud of you all the way. Ben Curry, 21, Sale flanker and by 90 minutes the elder of identical twin brother Tom, the England blindside flanker We were pretty similar when we were growing up \u2013 that\u2019s why we clashed so many times and had so many arguments. We were very competitive. Mind, playing him on PlayStation was not really a competition \u2013 he\u2019s rubbish at it. We\u2019re like an old married couple, we don\u2019t say too much to each other \u2013 we\u2019ve just lived together all our lives and you kind of get bored with each other. I knew he was good when he won his first England cap! Anyone who grows up playing rugby wants to play for England, he\u2019s done very well. And through his own doing and his hard work he has been given that chance. I am very proud of him. As a family we support each other in whatever we do, whether its an under-15 final or this, which happens to be one of the biggest stages in sport. We are on two separate journeys, we are two separate people, we are not always going to be in the same place at the same time \u2013 although I\u2019m very grateful to the club for sending me out to Japan. What would I say to him before the final? Er, win? Nothing needs to be said. He knows what he needs to do and he\u2019ll get told what he needs to do so there\u2019s nothing I can say which will change anything. He\u2019s got to the final without my messages so I don\u2019t think he needs anything from me to succeed! It is a World Cup, and it does mean a lot, but at the end of the day there\u2019s a lot more to life than a rugby game. Will Joseph, 17, London Irish academy and England U18 outside centre, on his older brother Jonathan, 28, England\u2019s centre among the replacements Jonathan was easygoing, very relaxed and a fun big brother. Although he was very focused on his rugby, he always found time for family. I remember hours spent with him messing around with a rugby ball in the garden and l loved going to watch my big brother play when he started out with London Irish. His achievements have made me realise anything is possible. I never really thought about a moment when I knew he was really good; he was just my big brother. Playing rugby at a high level was simply Jonathan\u2019s job. Like high-performing professionals in sport or any other career, he is dedicated and works hard to achieve results. We\u2019re a close family and we always stay in touch, and have talked and texted about the usual things brothers chat about while he\u2019s been in Japan. If I was there with him on Saturday, I would say: \u201cThis is the moment. Run onto the pitch and give it all you\u2019ve got. Your family believe in you and are always proud of you. And when you and the team lift the World Cup, the whole country will be proud of you too!\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
