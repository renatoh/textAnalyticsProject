I've subdued a generation\u2019", "bodyText": "A few months ago, James Blake was working on the biggest album of 2016 and he couldn\u2019t tell anyone. Beyonc\u00e9 had asked him to come to the studio and work on the secrecy-shrouded Lemonade. After he\u2019d been improvising for a while around her melodies and lyrical ideas, Beyonc\u00e9 arrived with her four-year-old daughter Blue Ivy to hear what he had come up with. Every time he sang the hook on the song Forward, Blue Ivy sang: \u201cForward!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s how you know it\u2019s catchy,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 told him. Blake\u2019s expression suggests he\u2019s almost as surprised by this story as I am. \u201cI remember thinking this is a very surreal time in my life,\u201d he says. Now he\u2019s doing something similar to Beyonc\u00e9, releasing his third album, The Colour in Anything, without fanfare last night. There had been hints \u2013 , but no confirmation until he appeared on Annie Mac\u2019s Radio 1 show on Thursday evening. Like Beyonc\u00e9, there would be no advance reviews. And, though the Guardian has been invited to hear the record, and to talk to him about it, it is under strict conditions of secrecy (in fact, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s album forced him to change his plans: the original intention had been to release it on 29 April). Blake is eating a late lunch in the Shoreditch branch of the Indian restaurant chain Dishoom. Nobody seems to recognise him, even though he\u2019s an unignorable 6ft 6in, but most of his fellow diners probably know his music, directly or indirectly, because this wry, unassuming 27-year-old Londoner is one of the most quietly important figures in pop. \u201cI feel like he\u2019s really influenced everybody a lot,\u201d producer Rick Rubin said last year. \u201cI know in the artist community everybody loves Blake.\u201d Since releasing his self-titled debut album in 2011, Blake\u2019s distinctive use of space and silence, his stark juxtaposition of intimate, emotionally direct vocals with sub-bassy club rhythms, has made him the musician\u2019s musician. Madonna called his music \u201cthe kind of thing that makes me jealous\u201d, and told him so over the phone while he was in the studio with Kanye West, who has publicly called him \u201cKanye\u2019s favourite artist\u201d. Joni Mitchell, one of his heroes, gave him career advice after a show. He has been covered by Lorde and sampled by Drake. Listen to artists including Jack Garratt, L\u00e5psley and FKA twigs, or the melancholy, nocturnal end of hip-hop, and you hear echoes of Blake everywhere. Blake, being a well-brought-up Englishman, takes compliments with a polite smile and a \u201cThat\u2019s nice\u201d, but he knows he has made his mark. \u201cThe xx set the precedent and I set the further precedent, and the music world has bent to that sound,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like the opposite of punk, isn\u2019t it? I got them all to shut up.\u201d He laughs. \u201cI\u2019ve subdued a generation. That will be my legacy.\u201d Blake has just returned from visiting his girlfriend, a British comedy writer and actor, in Los Angeles. They met a year or so ago and her influence on The Colour in Anything has been incalculable. \u201cShe was instrumental in helping me grow,\u201d he says. \u201cVery often, you only make changes when you feel like there\u2019s something to save. That\u2019s an incentive to look in the mirror.\u201d He picks at a bowl of broccoli and considers the past few years. \u201cThe times I needed to work things out and couldn\u2019t really understand my place in the world, I thought that was over at 18. The last few years have been immensely formative in ways I haven\u2019t expected. I enjoy the company of other people and their input more now. I\u2019m a more open person. I\u2019m far better at dealing with criticism. I\u2019ve even been comfortable with growing a slightly stupid ginger beard, which I would never have done before.\u201d He rubs his chin. \u201cAccepting it\u2019s ginger is the final step. The amount of times I\u2019ve said strawberry blonde \u2026\u201d Blake is fun to talk to because he\u2019s an unusually thoughtful critic of his own work. He practically psychoanalyses The Colour in Anything, the gist being that he needed to develop as a person if he was going to evolve musically. He calls the album a giant step forward as a singer, songwriter and producer, his \u201ccoming-of-age\u201d record. \u201cIf music stays the same thematically, people lose interest,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I was still talking about not getting laid when I was 18 then \u2026\u201d Is that what the first album\u2019s about? \u201cWell \u2026 yeah.\u201d He laughs. \u201cThere\u2019s a subtext of loneliness and not getting any. And that\u2019s a valid reason to be upset at that point, but it\u2019s not a valid reason at 27 if your whole life has changed.\u201d Blake has always felt comfortable being alone \u2013 too comfortable, he thinks. On I Never Learnt to Share, from his debut, he sang the line, \u201cMy brother and my sister don\u2019t talk to me but I don\u2019t blame them,\u201d over and over again. The explanation was that they don\u2019t exist: he\u2019s an only child. He thinks that explains a lot. \u201cYou feel as if you are in a petri dish environment where people are looking in and checking on your progress,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then you become famous at 21 and people are letting you be whoever you are, regardless of whether they like it or not. Even people close to you. They\u2019re not going to stand up to you, they\u2019re not going to tell you you\u2019re wrong. A lot of people who enter showbusiness at 21 or younger are frozen at that point and it\u2019s really only up to them to defrost themselves.\u201d Blake was raised in suburban north London and had a happy but self-contained childhood. \u201cI always felt like you were alone, no matter how many friends you had,\u201d he once told me. Music was a private obsession. He declined to join his school\u2019s orchestra or choir, preferring to play piano at home with the lights out. He was hardly a recluse \u2013 discovering dubstep clubs in 2007 led him to start DJing and producing a string of acclaimed EPs \u2013 but studying music at Goldsmiths in London didn\u2019t suit him at all. \u201cI didn\u2019t belong there,\u201d he says. \u201cGreat university, lovely people, I just don\u2019t think school or university was for me.\u201d He pauses, smiles. \u201cAnd, also, I was probably a little bit of a prick at the time. It\u2019s a huge underlying theme of those years.\u201d I first met Blake in December 2010, just before he released his debut. Sitting in an Enfield pub, he seemed witty and quietly confident, but more barbed and wary than he is now, bruised by the backlash from dance music partisans who were aggrieved that the producer they had celebrated was now singing strange, minimalist ballads and covering Feist\u2019s Limit to Your Love. The Quietus website dubbed his new direction \u201cblubstep\u201d. \u201cThe dance music community is where the most embittered critics hang out,\u201d Blake says matter-of-factly. \u201cYou can\u2019t read a website such as Resident Advisor without noticing that the comment section is full of people saying, \u2018I preferred his old stuff.\u2019 That\u2019s the dance music cliche. I now find it hilarious. I used to find it a bit scary. That happens wherever you go. If I started making gamelan music, people would say: \u2018I preferred his old polyrhythms.\u2019 You can\u2019t escape it.\u201d The criticism chipped away at his confidence, driving him deeper into himself. \u201cI was incredibly defensive,\u201d he says. \u201cI was fairly shy and a little bit suspicious of the world, and somehow felt I needed to prove myself by saying controversial things. I was determined to let everyone know I would never let anyone have control over what I did.\u201d Blake\u2019s debut, which he made entirely alone, was one of the quietest, most austere albums ever to inhabit the Top 10. At its most vaporous it made even the xx sound like the Ramones. Propelled by his commanding live shows, the album steadily gathered fans, but Blake felt that his use of silence as an instrument wasn\u2019t entirely strategic: something was missing. His father, James Litherland, a former session musician and member of 60s jazz-rock band Colosseum, told him he needed to write some lasting songs. The more substantial Overgrown, which featured collaborations with Brian Eno and RZA and was inspired by his long-distance relationship with Warpaint guitarist Theresa Wayman, won the 2013 Mercury prize just as his wider influence was becoming apparent. \u201cIt\u2019s immensely flattering when people are influenced by you,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I first started copying dubstep rhythms but using gospel-tinged, classically tinged keyboard playing, that was the thing that separated me, but now it\u2019s something that other people do, too. The whole night-time torch-song concept is now basically a pastiche. I had to move on from whatever gimmick made me different and just write better songs.\u201d Blake\u2019s first idea for album No 3 was to make an \u201coutward-looking, aggressive, hip-hop-influenced record\u201d with guest rappers including Kanye West, but he ended up using only Bon Iver\u2019s Justin Vernon, an old friend. \u201cI wanted to open up and be more outgoing,\u201d he says. \u201cThe only way I got there was to work on my fears and actually become a more open person, not just appear to be one. The record became a commentary on my life rather than me becoming part of the rest of the world.\u201d That was easier said than done. In January 2015, midway through writing the album, Blake hit a wall. Every night he went to sleep below his home studio in south London, worrying about the record. \u201cThe album was literally hanging above my head,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was almost comical.\u201d To relieve the pressure, he smoked too much weed (the subject of Put That Down and Talk to Me), which left his new material sounding \u201cgreyed out\u201d and lethargic. \u201cI hit a real low,\u201d he says. \u201cI started feeling like I was banging my head against the wall. It\u2019s a miracle that my current girlfriend walked in at that point.\u201d Blake used to consider his obsession with doing everything himself a kind of strength, but once his lovelife turned around he realised that his dogged independence partly stemmed from anxiety about letting people in. So he left the flat of doom and spent some time at Shangri-La, Rick Rubin\u2019s residential studio in Malibu, where the legendary producer would listen to playbacks of Blake\u2019s improvisations while lying on the floor, closing his eyes, stroking his immense beard and identifying his favourite bits: \u201cGood \u2026 good \u2026 could be useful \u2026\u201d Blake says, imitating Rubin. \u201cI felt so free, letting someone else take the reins.\u201d Blake has belatedly discovered the joy of socialising with other musicians, although he\u2019s still choosy. As well as collaborating with Beyonc\u00e9, he has worked extensively on the forthcoming album from Frank Ocean, \u201can incredible person\u201d. And though his track with West was never finished, it was a valuable experience. \u201cI like him,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery time I leave a room that Kanye has been in I feel a little electrified, a little inspired and a little more conscious of the fact that, if you\u2019ve had your instincts proved to you, then you can follow them right to the end of the line, despite people\u2019s criticisms.\u201d Blake orders a black coffee and talks about how he felt watching the scene in the Lemonade film where Forward plays while the mothers of Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner and Mike Brown hold up photographs of their murdered sons. \u201cI thought, wow, this is an incredible moment that I\u2019m somehow part of,\u201d he says. \u201cAs soon as I let people access me and help me and I stopped worrying about what would happen if I didn\u2019t have 100% control, these incredible things started happening.\u201d He shrugs. \u201cI can\u2019t help feeling a little bit silly for waiting that long.\u201d Blake hasn\u2019t undergone a complete transformation. He is still opinionated: \u201cStreaming has the whole music industry over a barrel. I\u2019m sure artists will eventually be remunerated, but it\u2019s a little bit late for some people.\u201d He remains private, shunning social media and declining to name his girlfriend. But he is no longer lonely, no longer defensive, no longer a little bit of a prick. The Colour in Anything is the sound of someone coming out of his shell. \u201cTo put it bluntly, I\u2019ve been validated,\u201d he says. \u201cBeyonc\u00e9 wants me to sing on her record. Everyone wants me to sing. I\u2019ve had my confidence broken down and built back up and I think I\u2019m in this zone where everything I do feels OK. If I can do that, what else can I do?\u201d \u2022 James Blake will be headlining Field Day on Saturday 11tJune at Victoria Park, London, marking the event\u2019s 10th Birthday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
