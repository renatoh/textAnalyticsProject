Oxford now has the fastest-growing endowment of any European university, and is raising more than \u00a3200m a year through philanthropic giving, the highest rate in UK higher education. There have been almost 50,000 individual donations of varying sizes to Oxford\u2019s well-endowed coffers over the last decade. Last year Oxford raised more than \u00a3204m, which represents a quarter of the overall UK total of university income from philanthropic funding that year. The university, which is the oldest in the English-speaking world, launched its Oxford Thinking campaign in 2004, to beef up its fundraising clout to put it within reach of US universities such as Harvard, Stanford and Yale which have a strong tradition of philanthropic funding. Almost 18% of Oxford alumni donated to the university in 2013-14, helping put the university at the top of the UK and European fundraising league. The university is already well on course to meets its final target in the current campaign of \u00a33bn. It still has some way to go to match comparable US institutions, but is catching up, according to a university spokesman. In 2011-12 Oxford came ninth in a global comparison of university philanthropic funding, behind eight North American universities. Among recent Oxford donations was \u00a375m from the venture capitalist Sir Michael Moritz and his wife, the writer Harriet Heyman \u2013 which the university says is the biggest single philanthropic gift for undergraduate financial support in European history. Hong Kong entrepreneur Li Ka-shing pledged \u00a320m to help establish a new centre, staffed by 600 scientists, bringing together big data research from different fields of medicine. And more than 1,200 donors contributed a total of \u00a317m to pay for new quadrangles and buildings for Pembroke College. News of Oxford\u2019s \u00a32bn success comes as universities across the country wait to see what the new Tory government has planned for the unprotected higher education budget. Pam Tatlow, the chief executive of the university thinktank million+, said: \u201cIn spite of their best efforts and various government schemes in the past, the majority of universities raise less than \u00a31m in annual endowment income. \u201cThere\u2019s an argument for government to take this into account when it\u2019s looking at grants because of the potential inequality for students.\u201d Last month a report revealed that British universities were raising more money than ever from former students, charities and other supporters. More than 120 universities in England, Scotland and Wales raised a combined \u00a3807m in 2013-14, with 16 institutions reporting donations and pledges of more than \u00a310m each, according to the Ross-Case report on higher education philanthropic giving in the UK. The figure was \u00a350m up on the previous record of \u00a3753m raised in 2011-12, and included contributions from 251,000 donors including 183,000 alumni. Oxford and Cambridge accounted for nearly 41%, or \u00a3323m, of the new funds. The Russell group of 21 universities excluding Oxbridge accounted for a further 38%, or just over \u00a3300m. Universities outside the Russell group picked up 21% of the total raised compared with 19% in 2012-13. In the US the figures are generally bigger. According to the Council for Aid to Education in New York, in 2013 Stanford University was the top fundraiser, with $932m (\u00a3598m); Harvard raised $792m; the University of South Carolina $675m and Columbia $647m, with Yale a little further down the list at $444m. The vice-chancellor of Oxford University, Professor Andrew Hamilton, who leaves Oxford next year to become president of New York University, said: \u201cReaching \u00a32bn in donations is an outstanding achievement for Oxford University. We are extremely grateful to the alumni, friends of the university, charities, companies and many others who have made it possible. \u201cTheir generosity is benefiting the entire Oxford collegiate community through increased financial support for students, ambitious programmes of academic research and high-quality new buildings and facilities. \u201cOxford will need ever-greater financial freedom in support of our mission to foster academic excellence at the highest level for the greatest common good. I\u2019m confident that the continuing good will and support of our donors and friends will allow us to achieve this, and that the \u00a33bn target will soon be in sight.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
