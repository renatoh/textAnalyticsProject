As Vince Cable attacked the Tories for an \u201cideological aversion\u201d to trade unions, McCluskey said he would not respect a new law that increased the threshold. David Cameron is expected to include in the Tory general election manifesto a proposal to raise the threshold in trade union strike ballots. Boris Johnson has suggested this could be as high as 50%. The Unite general secretary insisted in a speech to trade union lawyers in London that he would not respect such a law. McCluskey said: \u201cShould there be a Conservative majority in May, there will be a new attack on trade union rights and democracy. The bar for a strike ballot will be raised to a level which hardly any MPs would get over in their own constituencies, by a government which has refused our requests to use modern, more effective balloting methods. \u201cWhen the law is misguided, when it oppresses the people and removes their freedoms, can we respect it? I am not really posing the question. I\u2019m giving you the answer. It ain\u2019t going to happen.\u201d McCluskey added: \u201cUnite remains determined to operate ever more effectively within the law, even when that law is an ass and ill serves our people. But restricting the right to strike, attacking the capacity for trade unions to organise and conduct our own business in line with our own rules, belong to last century\u2019s consensus.\u201d McCluskey intervened as the business secretary said that turnout in trade union strike ballots could be increased through the \u201csensible\u201d reform of e-balloting rather than \u201cideological\u201d Tory plans to impose a threshold for a vote. In a reminder of the deep divisions between the coalition parties over the issue, the business secretary accused the Tories of having an \u201cideological aversion\u201d to trade unions as he unveils plans for e-balloting with the TUC. Cable said, in a joint announcement with the TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady, that the business department has established a task force to examine how e-balloting could be introduced within current legislation. The Lib Dems will include a commitment in their general election manifesto to introduce e-balloting, a reform that could increase turnout in strike ballots to the 50% threshold the Tories are thinking of imposing through legislation. Cable said: \u201cWe currently enjoy some of the best industrial relations in a generation, with overall strike days at an all-time low. Unions have been central to our economic recovery by keeping employees flexible, so we could keep Britain working. The Conservatives have an ideological aversion to trade unions and have repeatedly tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 during this parliament to curtail their mandate, such as trying to impose an arbitrary minimum threshold for vote turnouts. \u201cI favour more sensible reform by enabling unions to ballot their members using modern electronic voting and I have instructed my officials to work out how we can make this compatible with the current legal framework. This will increase the democratic legitimacy of any vote and the Liberal Democrats will be making the implementation of e-balloting a manifesto commitment.\u201d O\u2019Grady said: \u201cIt is time to bring union balloting into the 21st century. Like it or not, the postal service is only one way of communicating today, and it is time that union members had a proper choice of how they exercise their vote on important decisions in ways that preserve security and confidentiality, but boost turnout and participation. It is now common in organisations such as political parties, and this should be a non-controversial move welcomed by anyone that values democracy.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
