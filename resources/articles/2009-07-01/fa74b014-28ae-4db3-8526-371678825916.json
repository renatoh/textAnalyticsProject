Neither the BHA nor the RCVS would confirm or deny yesterday that there had been contact between the two bodies while Paul Struthers, the BHA's spokesman, said that \"there will be no further comment at all from the BHA in respect of James Main\". However, the Guardian understands that, while the BHA has not made a formal complaint against Main, the detailed findings of the hearing into the case have been passed to the college's professional conduct department for consideration. The college will be expected to examine Main's conduct during both the investigation and the subsequent disciplinary hearing over Moonlit Path, a mare trained by Henderson which tested positive for tranexamic acid (TA), a blood-clotting agent, after a race at Huntingdon in February. Main initially told BHA investigators that he had administered TA to Moonlit Path the day before her race. He later admitted that the injection had taken place on the day of the race, during an appointment at Henderson's yard recorded in his practice diary as a \"pre-race check\". He subsequently refused to attend the BHA hearing at which Henderson was found in breach of the anti-doping rules. The trainer was banned from making entries for three months and fined \u00a340,000. The panel hearing the case, chaired by Tim Charlton QC, expressed its frustration at Main's refusal to attend to give evidence. In its published reasons for its finding, the panel said it maintained the view \"that Mr Main ... had potentially crucial evidence to give\". Main is a partner in the leading practice O'Gorman, Slater and Main, which provides veterinary services for many leading stables in the Lambourn area. He is also a race-day vet at Newbury, though he recently resigned from a role as the veterinary adviser to the National Trainers' Federation and as a result no longer sits on the BHA's veterinary committee. Ian Holloway, a spokesman for the RCVS, yesterday followed the BHA's lead and refused to confirm or deny that details of the case had been passed to the college for consideration. However, he outlined the process that the college follows in such cases. \"The first stage would be consideration by our professional conduct department, which has a number of barristers and solicitors on its staff. They are screeners, if you like, to see if a case requires further investigation,\" he said. \"It would then be forwarded to the preliminary investigation committee and then passed on to be considered by the full disciplinary committee if that is felt to be warranted. If the charges are agreed by both sides, that would normally be heard about two weeks later.\" The entire process, Holloway said, \"can sometimes be completed in as little as six months or sometimes take as much as two years.\" In the meantime Main can continue to practise, as the college does not have the same powers as the General Medical Council, which can suspend medical practitioners facing serious misconduct charges. Main was unavailable for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
