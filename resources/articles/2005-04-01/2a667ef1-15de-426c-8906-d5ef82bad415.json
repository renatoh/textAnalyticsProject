The council tax bills posted through the doors of their gleaming glass apartments two years after the general election will have them sobbing into their caramel macchiatos. It is doubtful whether others will feel much sympathy for their plight. For the homeowners of Wandsworth Road, Battersea, boast a unique claim to fame: house prices in their neighbourhood have outperformed the regional average more than anywhere else in Britain, according to new research. But while they may have made a killing on the property market, they are about to start paying the price when council tax bands are overhauled this year for the first time in 14 years. Research by the analysis and forecasting group, Experian shows that between 1995 and 2004 the 2,747 households that make up the exclusive SW8 postcode that is Wandsworth Road saw the value of their houses rise by 122 per cent more than those in their surrounding area. This is an astonishing transformation for a neighbourhood dominated by the derelict Battersea power station and which five years ago boasted nothing more than a seedy nightclub and a hot dog stand. The change started when developers built futuristic apartments, dragging cafe society behind them. 'Let's be honest, it's not a particularly great location, but it's filling up with funky bars and restaurants,' said Charity Holden, manager of the Battersea branch of Foxton's estate agency. But gentrification comes at a price. Experian's research suggests people living in SW8 will be among the 1.6 million householders set for an increase in their council tax when the rebanding process is completed. 'Our analysis reveals that a third more properties are likely to be banded upwards than down, so it is not just a question of swings and roundabouts, ' said Bruno Rost of Experian. The research also provides a fascinating snapshot of how the property market has changed in the last decade. Prices in the village of Wolviston, in County Durham, have ballooned by 113 per cent, thanks to its proximity to luxury developments in nearby Wynyard, home to much of the Newcastle United team. 'Houses easily go for up to \u00a31 million in Wynyard and that has affected Wolviston,' said Teesside estate agent Charles Holmstrom. Wolviston is not the only place to feel the 'Premiership effect'. In twelfth place on the tax hike list is the London suburb of Totteridge, home to Tottenham and England goalkeeper Paul Robinson, and Arsenal's Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. Among the top 10 are locations in the Cotswolds, such as Stroud in Gloucestershire, and the desirable villages of Compton, in Wiltshire, and Ightfield, near Shrewsbury, in Shropshire. Council tax rebanding is likely to become a major political issue. The present bands are based on property prices at 1 April, 1991. But because of the property boom, the government is conducting a revaluation of Britain's 21.5 million homes. The process will cost \u00a3200m and will take effect from 1 April, 2007."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
