Convincing supporters that the impending appointment is the man to preserve their Premier League status, however, will be a much harder proposition. Gartside made the breakthrough with his Leicester counterpart, Milan Mandaric, who had twice rejected requests to approach Megson, on the day a poll on the Bolton Evening News website delivered an embarrassing snub to his preferred candidate to replace Sammy Lee. The poll listed four names the Bolton chairman has considered in the past week as he seeks to repair a remarkable downturn in fortunes since Sam Allardyce left in April: Megson, Chris Coleman, Steve Bruce and Graeme Souness, who withdrew this week amid concerns that the Leicester manager was Gartside's strongly favoured option. A fifth name was also up for election, AN Other, and it was he who romped home with over 50% of the vote. Megson came bottom with a meagre 1.7%, or 12 votes from the 699 cast. It will be this underwhelming reception, plus a club with disillusioned senior players and one league win in 10 matches, that await the 48-year-old if he accepts Gartside's offer to become Bolton's third manager in six months. The appointment is expected before Sunday's game with Aston Villa, with Archie Knox continuing for tonight's Uefa Cup tie with Braga. \"It is with great reluctance that I have agreed to allow Gary Megson to open talks with Bolton,\" said the Leicester chairman. \"Gary left me with no choice when he informed me he wanted to leave and talk to the Premiership club. Bolton's interest was neither welcome nor invited but it was evident to me, following a meeting requested by Gary following last night's home defeat by Sheffield United, that his loyalties and heart lay elsewhere.\" Megson had not signed the three-year contract offered by Leicester but the compensation is believed to be close to the \u00a3300,000 Bolton first proposed. Mandaric has commenced the search for a fifth manager since completing his takeover in February, and the assistant manager, Frank Burrows, will take temporary control with Gerry Taggart."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
