Before this, that's how long it had been since Liverpool last managed to score a goal at the Riverside , a statistic that gives some idea as to why the Reds have failed to land a Premier League title over recent seasons. This time around they found the net thanks to a second-half Fernando Torres blockbuster that gave the visitors a draw. Yet a point still leaves Liverpool well adrift of the leading pack with four months of the campaign remaining. True, they finished the stronger side and went close to clinching a seventh away win of the season during the closing minutes, but only the most biased Liverpool supporter would say Middlesbrough did not deserve at least a share of the spoils. So can Liverpool kiss goodbye to the title for another year? 'In this position you cannot think about the leaders. You just think about the next game,' said the manager Rafa Benitez. 'I am disappointed. I think we started really well and after the first half an hour were controlling the game. In the second (half) we were controlling the game and creating chances. In the last 30 minutes we were attacking all the time and the players wanted to win, but we haven't.' Although Steven Gerrard came close to opening the scoring in the 11th minute with a right-foot drive that brought a marvellous save from Mark Schwarzer, it is fair to say that Middlesbrough edged the game until the intervention of Torres with 19 minutes remaining. Such has been their poor home form of late - the win against Arsenal in December excepted - it still came as a surprise when the Teessiders took the lead midway through the first half. After Liverpool's defence failed to deal with a cross from the left by Stewart Downing, the ball was turned back across the face of goal by Jeremie Aliadiere for captain George Boateng to score from a couple of yards out. Had Downing's 67th-minute shot gone in instead of rattling the woodwork, then Middlesbrough would probably have recorded only their third home league win of the season. The visitors seemed devoid of ideas and creativity at that point, the expected backlash from their blip at Luton last weekend simply not materialising. Gerrard, Javier Mascherano, Yossi Benayoun and Andriy Voronin were anonymous, although Middlesbrough must take some credit for making it that way. However, within four minutes of Downing's near-miss Liverpool had drawn level. Torres, another who had until that point gone absent without leave, collected a pass in midfield and ran at goal at speed as the Middlesbrough defenders backed off. His shot from around 25 yards out left Schwarzer with no chance, the ball rising high to the Australian goalkeeper's right. The touch paper had been lit. From that moment on Liverpool battered the Middlesbrough goal. The puzzle is why they waited so long to do so. Perhaps they had got word about developments at the Emirates. Gerrard's shot from 20 yards was pushed over the bar and a Sami Hyypia header brought another save from Schwarzer at his near post. Gerrard, warming at last to the task, sent another curling shot from the left narrowly wide only for time to run out. The cheers from the home fans on the final whistle left no doubt as to who valued this result the most. 'Had we got the second, when we hit the post, I think we would have gone on and won the game,' said Middlesbrough manager Gareth Southgate. 'But when you see that their goal has been scored by a guy who cost as much as our entire 16, then I don't think that's such a bad result. 'Prior to that, they hadn't really caused us too many problems. Then when they scored we were hanging on a bit during the last 10 minutes. But I was pleased we dug in and took something from the game. We haven't done enough of that here. 'We've dropped far too many points at home and have had to rely on the odd good away result to keep us out of the bottom three. Why, I just don't know. We seem to be able to up our game against the so-called top teams and let ourselves down against everyone else. 'But today I'm proud of the players and I'm proud of the result, if a bit disappointed we didn't win having gone ahead.' THE FANS' VERDICT Geoff Vickers, MSS-online.org I would have taken a point at the start, but we played really well for 70 minutes and should have been more than 1?0 up. The turning point was when Downing hit the post - Torres then scored a stunning goal and we were hanging on at the end. Boateng did very well on his return and deserved his goal. We do need a striker, but Downing was great and we can't afford to lose him to fund the fee to pay for one. He's our most creative player and a local lad, too. Liverpool were very disappointing, especially in the first half. It was close to a sell-out today and I'm sure the Boro fans will have been pleased with what they saw.

If I was a Boro fan I'd be gutted not to have won. They outfought us and that's not nice to see. We seemed to have no passion and were just launching it forward. Babel was on for the second half and I thought we'd really give it a go, but we didn't. They hit the post and it was only when Torres scored we looked interested. His goal was brilliant, though - I think it's his first from outside the area. We've said before we over?rely on some individuals players and the way we played it looked like they had more than us. Riise was as bad as he's been, but Voronin was the worst on the pitch - no pace, can't head, can't dribble, doesn't hold it up. I hate slagging off Liverpool players, I really do.
