Which is to say, the torch relay was conceived for the 1936 Games, and enthusiastically adopted by the PR Nazis (for once I use the term advisedly) of the Third Reich. They saw its potential for knitting their own Aryan aspirations into a timeless heroic ideal, carried aloft all the way from Olympia to Berlin. The next Games were held in London, and \u2013 somewhat inexplicably \u2013 the organisers of 1948's austerity-tinged event saw no reason to drop the tradition started by their recent enemy. We have been saddled with the spectacle ever since, to increasingly farcical effect, and this week the 2012 organisers announced the 1,018 spots up and down these islands at which the torch will call before coming to rest at the Olympic Stadium. Naturally, only the pinpoints on a map have been revealed \u2013 the London Organising Committee (Locog) will not release the precise route between them for \"security reasons\". Yet if the minutes of the discussions of the sports minister, Hugh Robertson, with a parliamentary committee last week are anything to go by, it is just as wary of the dreaded ambush marketing, the tactic that sees unaffiliated companies queer the pitch of the official sponsors by advertising their wares in some stunty way or other. In the list of unpardonable modern sins, ambush marketing seems to rank somewhere between running a Ponzi scheme and terrorism, and all manner of special legislation has been placed on the statute book to frighten people off attempting it next summer. In one extraordinary amendment to the 2006 Olympics Act, the burden of proof has actually been reversed, so that firms will automatically be found guilty of the offence of associating themselves with the Games unless they can prove that they took all reasonable steps to prevent that offence taking place. Not all these powers will be extended to the torch route, rather maddeningly for the increasingly authoritarian Locog (it recently emerged that the organising committee issued guidance on what colour and species of plant private citizens should put in their hanging baskets and front gardens if they're on the cycle road race route, in order that they co-ordinate with the 2012 colour scheme). So the Department for Culture, Media and Sport is liaising with local authorities as to how to stamp out ambush marketing along the top secret trail. Those privy to the route, however, are the torch relay sponsors, or the \"presenting partners\" as they're called. Coca-Cola is one, Samsung is another, but the only national presenting partner is \u2013 hang on, Lloyds TSB! If, like me, you now own a stake in so many banks that you need flashcards to keep track of your unenviable portfolio, you might have forgotten that we taxpayers were forced to bail out Lloyds Banking Group, of which Lloyds TSB is a division. Then again, perhaps your memory was refreshed this week when the bank, whose chief executive is off work with fatigue, announced that it was not going to meet key financial targets, and the taxpayer was reminded that it is currently facing multibillion\u2011pound losses on that stake. Still, at least it has found the cash to be a presenting partner for the torch relay. Such is the arse-about-titness of \"your\" Olympics that Lloyds TSB branding will be slapped all along the relay. Meanwhile, even involuntary association with the Games by local businesses \u2013 who didn't actually screw over the whole country \u2013 will result in punishment. If the world were remotely rational, anyone would be allowed to brand the torch route on the basis that we're all technically part-owners of Lloyds. But it's not. And so it is that we find Lloyds's website trilling about the opportunities it will be providing to schools along the way. Forgive the cavil, but I can't help feeling that schools facing the most savage cuts in several generations as a direct result of the actions of banks such as Lloyds would have preferred to retain a music department, say, than the chance to share in the magic of the Lloyds story. For odiousness, it somehow surpasses even this week's other Olympic-related news, that the government has forked out almost \u00a3750,000 on corporate hospitality tickets for the Games. One can only hope anti-bankster protests \u2013 and their inevitable heavy-handed removal by the authorities \u2013 will be a major feature of the torch relay, so that by the time the flame finally reaches Stratford, anger at the way the country was sold out to the Games is burning stronger than ever."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
