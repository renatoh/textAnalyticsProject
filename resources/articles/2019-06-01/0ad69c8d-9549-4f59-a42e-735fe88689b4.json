But the new lineup of Freddie Flintoff, Chris Harris and Paddy McGuinness aims to modernise the BBC\u2019s multimillion-pound brand, countering the toxic masculinity that often beset it in the past by giving the show \u201cemotional depth\u201d. In contrast to Clarkson and co\u2019s Amazon show The Grand Tour, which the singer Will Young criticised recently for its \u201cshaming homophobic narratives\u201d, the new series of Top Gear, which begins on 16 June, features Flintoff, Harris and McGuinness embracing other cultures and each other amid the banter and fast cars. With this third lineup in as many years, the BBC is gambling that the chemistry between the trio can turn around a fall in ratings since Clarkson\u2019s sacking in 2015 for punching a producer. BBC Studios is keen to get Top Gear back on track as it has a global audience of 350 million and makes millions of pounds in merchandise and sales to help fund the rest of the BBC. McGuinness said: \u201cI feel as though we\u2019re bringing a different vibe to the show, which is a positive in my eyes, with families watching it. Chris does his pure car reviews but there\u2019s also funny bits \u2026 then there\u2019s hugs and nice bits such as what we thought about Ethiopia. \u201cI think that\u2019s a good thing. It just happens because that\u2019s how we are and that\u2019s the way the world is now.\u201d Harris, who worked on the show previously with Chris Evans and Matt Le Blanc, said: \u201cWe hug each other; we didn\u2019t hug each other before. Whenever I say goodbye to them after a day\u2019s work, we have a hug. We live in a different world. The new Top Gear will embrace all sorts of emotions.\u201d Flintoff said: \u201cIt\u2019s got a lot of honesty as well, in terms of talking about how you feel, what you\u2019re doing or the car.\u201d The trio indulge in some boyish, competitive behaviour such as electrocuting each other during an episode on electric cars. McGuinness said: \u201cOn camera we take the mickey but when the cameras stop, genuinely we are there for each other, [asking] \u2018are you all right pal?\u2019 and that.\u201d Flintoff, who has spoken openly about his mental health issues, said: \u201cWe have a laugh but we\u2019ve got each other\u2019s back. I remember back in the day in cricket if you spoke about your feelings you\u2019d get a clip round the ear from one of the older players and told to sort yourself out, but now it\u2019s different.\u201d Whereas Clarkson, Hammond and May strained diplomatic relations with a number of countries \u2013 most notably when using a car in Argentina with a Falklands-connected registration plate H982 FKL, and breaching Ofcom\u2019s code for using a racial slur while filming in Thailand \u2013 the new presenters are keen to immerse themselves in other cultures when abroad, with Flintoff even eating live grubs, a local delicacy, in Borneo. \u201cWe travel around, people come out and see us and we\u2019re involving them. I think that\u2019s definitely different,\u201d Flintoff said. \u201cIt\u2019s a people show, we shouldn\u2019t be detached from that.\u201d The new Top Gear is also going back to its roots by filming more in Britain. Harris said: \u201cTop Gear, for entirely understandable reasons, started to focus on its international status because it was selling so well in international territories. Paddy and Freddie \u2026 inject fresh blood to make it a great British show again. If it succeeds at 8pm on a Sunday night on BBC Two then it\u2019ll become more saleable overseas.\u201d Harris acknowledged that the show had \u201cbaggage\u201d, but McGuinness said there was \u201can opportunity \u2026 it\u2019s our job to make the previous shows look lacklustre.\u201d Top Gear\u2019s executive producer, Clare Pizey, said the series would be less scripted and more ad-libbed than previously and have \u201cemotional depth\u201d. She said the trio were \u201canarchic \u2026 naturally competitive and naturally insulting to each other \u2026 these are men who are OK to hug and to talk about their feelings.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
