Everybody seems to be enjoying the experience. There's Iain Duncan Smith smiling and fiddling with his tie. Lord Strathclyde scratching his head like Oliver Hardy. Big Dave the PM looks ready to sneeze. Michael Gove is gurning. And amid all the jollity, the Queen is stone faced. Ever the mistress of comic timing. So why was it such a happy occasion? One explanation is that everyone knew they were part of an event that would be talked about for generations. But many will feel part of the feelgood factor was that Voldemort Lansley, botcher of the health reforms, now leader of the Commons, missed it. Poor Voldemort. He was stuck on a First Capital Connect train on his way in (overhead lines down in the Hitchin area). Voldemort is very cross and hasn't he let them know it? There have been irate communications and yesterday he slagged off First Capital Connect in the House. Still, there's always Photoshop. Voldemort's head on Eric Pickles's body perhaps. Our picture desk can do that sort of thing. \u2022 What they can't do is turn back the clock, but if they could a cast of characters would benefit. One such might be Tony Hayward, ex-boss of BP hounded out of office after the catastrophic Gulf oil spill. He has never been quite the same since, and PR guru Matthew Freud, writing in one of his company's publications, recalls how Hayward learned the painful facts of life. Freud introduced Hayward to Arthur Sulzberger Jr, publisher of BP's principal tormentor during the controversy, the New York Times. \"With characteristic mid-party charm I said, 'Tony, meet the man who gave you your life back'.\" Sulzberger raised an eyebrow. \"Ah yes,\" he said, \"you fell foul of the second law of journalism.\" What's that, asked Hayward. \"It wasn't your fault, it was your turn.\" What's the first law of journalism, he asked. That's the joke, said the mighty publisher. There isn't one. \u2022 A fascinating document from Freud and it includes a contribution from Jonathan Powell, Tony Blair's loyal chief of staff. With the coalition endlessly harping on about more openness, Powell pleads for less. \"Why transparency is incompatible with good government,\" is his headline. The Freedom of Information Act was intended for ordinary people, he says. Instead it has become \"the plaything of journalists with which to harass the government\". Terrible things are happening. \"The decision to publish the attorney general's advice on the invasion of Iraq is a case in point.\" Yes, failure to keep that quiet was the Blair administration's biggest mistake by far. \u2022 Strange behaviour. But eccentricity is in our DNA. We are British. Witness events in Cambridge last Friday. A Stagecoach bus arrived. The door opened. A passenger climbed on who shouldn't have. \"The bus isn't nearly ready,\" snapped the new driver, a dour older man. The driver then began to strip. Off came the jacket, shirt and trousers to reveal a bunny onesie, with fluffy paws, tummy and tail. \"Now the bus is ready,\" he said, taking his place behind the wheel. The bus filled up, and no one passed comment during the 15-mile journey save for one traveller who couldn't resist. \"Nice costume you've got there, mate,\" he said. The driver stared straight ahead. \"I'm the Easter bunny,\" he replied. And it seemed prudent not to argue with him. \u2022 But if it is conversation you seek, ring us. There is so much we could talk about; Andrew Mitchell and how to communicate with police officers. Voldemort Lansley and the woes of commuting. Or Grant Shapps and the importance of his funny alter ego Michael Green. So much to discuss, so give us a ring tomorrow when our writers and editors are taking calls and donations to raise money for this year's Guardian Christmas charity appeal. Call 020 3353 4368 between 10am and 6pm. The diary will be there dispensing wisdom to those who offer donations between 12pm and 2pm. We countenance just one act of generosity each calendar year and this is it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
