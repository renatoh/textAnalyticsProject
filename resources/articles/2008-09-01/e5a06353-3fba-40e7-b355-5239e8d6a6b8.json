It is also the story of old families and new money, of arranged marriages and power-broking, of a way of life where an honest man is one who keeps careful records of all his bribes and shady deals. And it is the story of Ashraf Bey, who may or may not be the son of the Emir of Tunis, and is someone in transition from wide-boy drifter to man of substance. Invited to the city by an aunt he didn't know existed, to be married to a young woman he has never met, Ashraf soon becomes the main suspect in a murder investigation. Grimwood writes rich and pacy prose, combining science fiction, thriller, and hard-boiled crime fiction with a vivid, sultry setting steeped in highly believable alternate history. This novel may at heart be a whodunit, but the real mystery is Ashraf Bey himself: who he is, what he is, and what he will become."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
