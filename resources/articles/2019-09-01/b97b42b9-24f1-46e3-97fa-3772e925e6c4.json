It has been seven months since the British designer made his debut for the Italian house to huge critical acclaim in February. Before his arrival, the house had been helmed by Tomas Maier for 17 years and had built a strong identity for reliable, if safe, luxury. It was a rule book that Lee respected but rewrote with his first collection. The fashion industry raced to be the first to shoot it, Instagram blew up with adoration for it and waiting lists amassed before product hit the shop floor. His mechanism for handling such immediate attention and interrogation, he said, is one that many creatives will identify with: he retreated. \u201cThis last year has been intense, I haven\u2019t gotten out much,\u201d he smiled backstage, adding that in the lead-up to this outing he has remained quite insular. It was aided by the fact that he doesn\u2019t have Instagram so is sheltered from the hype. Of course Lee \u2013 who previously worked in the design team at Celine \u2013 has something on his side that he didn\u2019t have last season: the benefit of hindsight. He knows what his Bottega customer wants because they have been all-consuming of it. Composed and humble in person, the quiet confidence he now possesses showed in this second collection. Leather, the brand\u2019s USP, dominated throughout, from the first paper-thin asymmetrical dress to the black boiler suits, hooded anoraks and belted trenches, all of which were lightweight, being a spring/summer collection and waterproof. He\u2019s a Brit after all. As well as being a texture-fest, key looks included a trio of cowl-neck sequinned dresses in zingy tomato red, gold and blue and a duo of halterneck scarf tops with pineapple and Matisse-inspired monkey prints. The latter was to have \u201csomething that felt cheeky. A lot of the collection felt quite graphic and prints are something that I\u2019ve felt interested in since the beginning.\u201d They were, he said \u201cclothes to live in \u2026 solidifying the icons and the things that we\u2019ve become known for\u201d but rooted in \u201cthe reality of dressing and close to living\u201d. While it won\u2019t be everyone\u2019s idea of everyday clothes, no less the former Bottega customer, Lee\u2019s growing fanbase says otherwise. The most popular pieces from his last collection were unquestionably his slip-on leather heels and he continued what is sure to be a winning streak today. This time they featured the unique woven method called Intrecciato which the brand owns and has purveyed for years. Bags \u2013 another brand staple \u2013 came in the same design. The classic hobo bag was given the XXXL treatment and came slung around the body, while moulded wooden box clutches were new. \u201cEvery collection so far has felt an evolution to what we\u2019ve ever done before. Since I first met with [Bottega Veneta owner and Kering CEO] Francois Henri Pinault and was deciding what I wanted it to be, its felt like a constant evolution.\u201d While financial confirmation of his work is yet to be posted, the palpable sense of its success will be assuring Pinault he has backed a winner with Lee\u2019s appointment. In the midst of a month\u2019s worth of shows, highlights like this stand out. \u201cI want to be bold \u2013 otherwise what\u2019s the point?\u201d reasoned Lee. \u201cI want to make a statement \u2013 I don\u2019t see the point in making fashion that doesn\u2019t say something. You love it or you hate it but that\u2019s human nature.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
