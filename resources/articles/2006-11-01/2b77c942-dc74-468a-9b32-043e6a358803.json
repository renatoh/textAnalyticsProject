Can't wait for the 10-year reunion Xmas special. Carefree \u00b7 I was working at the Daily Mail when the show ended. We (the showbiz team) had the wheeze of asking Amy Jenkins to write three new episodes following on from where the show left off (that fabulous wedding punch-up). They were due to run in the paper. The senior newspaper executives had heard that it was a zeitgeisty show and were very keen on the idea. But then it turned out that none of them had actually seen it. And when they saw the copy (gay sex, drug-taking, swearing, women with careers), they ran a mile. Ms Jenkins was paid a kill-fee and the scripts never saw the light of day. I'm very glad that the show is coming back now. Just as I was delighted to see the Royle Family come back. And Prime Suspect. MediaGuardian Editor \u00b7 I love the bit in the first episode when aspiring young lawyer Millie is at court and needs to phone the office and uses a PAYPHONE. An historical document of the way we used to live. minke \u00b7 Wasn't the second series of This Life much better because it had nothing to do with its creator Amy Jenkins? Bit underwhelmed by prospect of the Xmas edition only because apparently she's writing it. mixulee \u00b7 The main thing that struck me on seeing the repeats was how much you don't get female characters like Anna any more on TV. Sure, you get the Sex-and-the-City-type females who are fairly sexually assertive, but still have perfect wardrobes and designer flats, and speak for the most part in sugar-laced platitudes. But Anna was a hard-edged, spiky mess, a chain-smoking alcoholic who sat reading Russian novels in her pigsty bedroom and muttering at the couple in the next room \"will you just fucking come\". More importantly, she was totally unapologetic about the way she was, nor did the show encourage you to feel that she ought to be \"redeemed\" at some point. No wonder then that when I first watched it at 16, I used to want to be like Anna. AFSmith \u00b7 Every now and again a programme captures \"an era\". This Life was about a particular time and breed of youth culture. It is WRONG to \"go back\", always wrong because the moment has gone! The only good reason to repeat these programmes is if you have purchased them or made them, and have paid for two transmissions, because you don't incur any repeat fees - which is probably what Roly Keating is doing now filling the graveyard slot for nothing. MELANIEBELLAMY \u00b7 Supposedly ... Miles has made a fortune in hotels and lives in a pile in the country with his wife. Egg is a successful writer who gained fame from writing a book about the group's friendship. Milly has a baby and an environmentalist partner and lives in Stoke Newington. Warren is a life coach?! Anna is still a barrister with a ticking bio clock (if its ticking at all after the gallons of vodka and mountains of gak she's consumed in the past 10 years). Let's hope Miles has a sports car and a Toad-of-Toad-Hall mustard waistcoat. inuit11"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
