Subtitled Ein L\u00e4cheln Zaubert die Welt (A Smile Charms the World) the show is being tested on continental audiences before a decision is made whether to take it to London. Libel lawyers have been involved in the production's evolution. A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said it was 'highly unlikely' any member of the royal family would see it. The musical takes a sympathetic approach to the woman who 'transformed the House of Windsor'. Producer Karl-Heinz Stracke, 79, came up with the idea during a visit to London in August 1997, the time of her death. 'I was struck by the outpouring of grief,' said the former opera singer. He gathered a 40-strong cast of mainly British actors, who underwent six months of intensive training in German. Karen Gillingham, 28, who plays Diana, said the role was one of the most challenging of her career. 'Lady Di accompanied me in my youth, she was part of my life, because no day ever went by when there wasn't some report about her.' She prepared for the part by poring over her grandmother's scrapbooks on the royal family. 'The musical follows Lady Di's life, and I'm quite comfortable about the way she is portrayed in the musical,' she said, munching a sausage in between rehearsals. But she would be nervous about playing the part in London. 'We'll have to see if that's possible. I don't know if I like the idea of William and Harry seeing it,' she told German television. The show does not flinch from portraying the trials of Diana's life, including her fight against bulimia and her alleged suicide attempts. In one scene she slits her wrists on stage. Members of the royal family, dubbed 'the Firm' by Diana, are portrayed in another scene wearing white, featureless masks, while Diana cowers from them. The musical begins and ends with the Paris car crash that killed her. Diana is shown as a young woman who struggles to cope with her responsibilities. 'I tried to make it a psychological portrait reflecting her strengths and weaknesses,' said the show's writer Volker F\u00fchrer. In a diplomatic move on the part of the producer, and one said to have appeased the lawyers, no actor plays Prince Charles. He is shown twice with his back to the audience, and otherwise only speaks through Diana's secretary. The Queen is also absent. The musical will play in 30 theatres in Germany before the end of the year, and then travel to Switzerland and Austria. An English-language version is set to tour Denmark, Finland, Luxembourg and Sweden. Lady Di has been in rehearsal for the past few weeks in a former trade union club house in the east German town of Wolfen, famous for its chemical works, where locals were finally given the chance to see it for a modest 30 marks (\u00a310) last week. 'It's not bad that we get to see it here before anyone else in the world,' said local Simone Schmidt. 'Even though we were cut off from the Western world by communism for years, her story touched us.' The local paper approved, summing it up as '120 minutes of loving, quaking and tears on 12 metres of stage'."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
