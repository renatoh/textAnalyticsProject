Following South Africa's 49-3 thrashing of Fiji, moreover, there is the prospect of more to come when they will almost inevitably steamroll Namibia in North Harbour on Thursday, by which point they will have four wins in succession in all competitions. The murmurings have begun. Might South Africa, far from being the weakest Tri-Nations side, now be the southern hemisphere's best chance of lifting the Webb Ellis Cup again? All of which is some way removed from the cloud that covered them after three defeats from the first three starts in the Tri-Nations this summer. At the time the coach, Peter de Villiers, was getting it in the neck. He was criticised for sending a second string to Sydney for the Tri-Nations opener, and paying the price, and then for sticking with the captain, John Smit, at hooker ahead of the clearly more effective Bismarck du Plessis. Next, in the rematch with the Wallabies in Durban, he asked Smit to shift from hooker to tight-head to allow Du Plessis on the field, which effectively introduced tired legs \u2013 Smit's \u2013 into the most demanding scrummaging position in the pack, and again the Boks were charged full price. For the final game of the series, which they won in Port Elizabeth against New Zealand, Du Plessis made no effort to hide his upset at being hauled off in the second half for Smit to come on. Quite apart from the potential that created for discontent in the camp, South Africa ended up bottom of the Tri-Nations table and De Villiers was heavily criticised as the team came into the World Cup. But Bryan Habana, who will return from injury against Namibia, makes light of the pressure that had built-up around the South Africans as they arrived in New Zealand. \"The biggest pressure we have is the pressure we put on ourselves to perform,\" he says. \"I think we might have been a bit disappointed with how we played in Durban against Australia but the New Zealand game was a great momentum-builder going into the World Cup.\" So much so that the one-point squeak past Wales in the opening round was followed by a transformation against Fiji last weekend when an unexpected expansive game was allied to the traditional core strength at the breakdown, a happy result of the players reacting to circumstances on the pitch. Indeed, the Springbok camp now exudes happiness and light. It helps that the sun has come out in Taupo and that they are staying in a pleasant resort out of town. And that their injury toll will be a lot lighter when it comes to the critical pool game, against Samoa, a week on Friday. By then the hamstring problems effecting Victor Matfield and Johann Muller are due to be sorted, while Butch James (hip) and the centre Jean de Villiers, who has sore ribs, should return. All are expected to be in full training by Sunday, by which point the Boks will almost certainly be four from four. They claim nothing dramatic has changed to put them in a happier place, rather that they have gone from being underdone to nicely cooked. As for the Smit\u2011Du Plessis issue, the line is that both men were sat down pre-tournament and Smit was told he was getting the start against Wales, after which it was an open affair. So is the coach happy that the criticism of the Boks has been replaced by something more upbeat? \"Well you're talking to a coach now and to get a happy coach you're going to have to look far to find someone like that,\" De Villiers says, in that unique style of his. \"We want everyone to become perfect and we won't get it because people aren't perfect. So, I'm happy with the structures we put in place six months ago and where we want to be in this tournament by now and I feel that we are still progressing and I'm happy with that. We're working towards a peak and we hope to strike at the right time.\" Habana, who could become South Africa's record try-scorer should he cross the line for No39 against Namibia, agrees. \"We were sort of disappointed with that first\u2011up effort against Wales, but the pressure we put on ourselves as a Springbok team to perform is greater than any other pressure we perceive or we feel. We as a team have set ourselves high standards and we've set ourselves high goals for this tournament. I don't think there is any player in this team who doesn't want to achieve those standards. \"I think Wales had been building up for that game against us for three years now. The last six encounters against them have been pretty close. We all knew they were going to be a tough game and the feeling in the changing room was definitely one of nerves before that Welsh game. \"Against Fiji, we knew what they were going to bring and we knew what we had to achieve to get through that game. The standards we have for ourselves as a team are pretty important and we would like to go out there in the next two or three weeks and make sure we get those standards right.\" brendanfanningrugby.wordpress.com/ South Africa Lambie; Aplon, Fourie, F Steyn, Habana; M Steyn, Hougaard; Van der Linde, Smit (capt), Steenkamp, Rossouw, B Botha, Burger, Alberts.
