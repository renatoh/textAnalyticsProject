There has been trepidation surrounding the fixture ever since the draw for the fourth round was made last month given the rivalry that exists between the clubs and the fact it takes place at the London Stadium, which has been dogged by disturbances and incidents of violence following West Ham\u2019s move there from Upton Park before the start of the season. There have been nine arrests outside the Stratford venue, while 23 banning orders have been issued by West Ham, ranging from drinking in view of the pitch to breaking the line of segregation. There were clear instances of disturbances in the stands during the Premier League fixture against Watford. Recent matches have brought an increased line of segregation and more stewards, as well as improved levels of training, but there are fears there could be further trouble inside the stadium and across surrounding areas on Wednesday for what has officially been deemed a high-risk fixture. \u201cThe Metropolitan Police Service have been working closely with all London Stadium stakeholders ahead of the Chelsea game, and there is a robust policing plan in place to deal with crime and disorder,\u201d said a spokesperson for London Stadium partners West Ham, E20 Stadium LLP and London Stadium 185. \u201cThe depth of the line of segregation between home and visiting fans at London Stadium was made significantly wider after the game against Watford with additional stewards deployed in that area. We have had no issues with the new segregation and we have had positive feedback from supporters in that area and consider this issue to now be resolved.\u201d Chelsea have been allocated just under 5,200 tickets for Wednesday\u2019s tie. Ticket sales for home fans have been limited to those with a recorded purchase history, while no alcohol will be sold pre-match from mobile bars outside the stadium. Those inside will be open as normal, albeit serving drinks in plastic cups, while there will be no post-match sales."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
