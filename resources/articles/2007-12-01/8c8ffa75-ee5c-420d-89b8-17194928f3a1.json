But speaking after Bolton's win against Birmingham the Senegal international did just that. Diouf will be leaving in January but only to go to Ghana to represent his country in the African Cup of Nations. \"I'll definitely stay at Bolton for the rest of the season. It's hard for the team now that I'm going to the African Nations but I want to do as well as I can before I leave to make sure we are safe from relegation,\" he said. \"I want the team to be doing well so, when I come back, it will be hard for me to get my place back.\" It is perhaps strange to hear such sentiments from a man who is greeted like a pantomime villain at any away ground, Anfield in particular is a difficult place for Diouf to go with Liverpool supporters still angry at him for spitting at a Celtic fan during a Uefa Cup tie in March 2003, months after he joined for what was soon deemed an inflated \u00a310m fee. There have been similar incidents since, Diouf was banned for three matches after spitting at Portsmouth's Arjan de Zeeuw in November 2004 but the 26-year-old Diouf is a wiser man now and more determined to let his football mould his reputation. Against Birmingham on Saturday he put in another performance which indicated that G\u00e9rard Houllier's only mistake was investing so much money in him at such a tender age. Diouf chased every ball and used it with intelligence and skill. His touch is undoubtedly that of an international and his opening goal, for which he left Birmingham's full-back Stephen Kelly and goalkeeper Maik Taylor staring up at him from their backsides, shows why his statement of commitment is valued at Bolton. Saturday's strike was only his third of the season but he has never been a regular goalscorer - 12 in 84 appearances since joining Bolton in August 2004 - and he, more than anyone, recognises his talents lie elsewhere. \"I'm not like Alan Shearer, someone who scores 20 or 30 goals a season,\" Diouf said. \"I'm on the pitch to help the team and give something to my team-mates.\" Those team-mates include Nicolas Anelka whose finishing abilities are without question. The Frenchman's brace against Birmingham took his tally this season to 11 and he is now the Premier League's joint top-scorer. No wonder Chelsea are rumoured to be looking to pounce during next month's transfer window. The Bolton captain, Kevin Nolan, is doing everything he can to make Anelka stay, even telling the 29-year-old that he will score fewer goals in west London than he currently does in Lancashire. \"He [Anelka] joins in the banter and he must be enjoying his football here because he's scoring goals,\" Nolan said. \"I don't think he wants another move anyway; he's had enough of those.\" The records show it is seven in the past 10 years. Alex McLeish wishes he had a player of Anelka's ability, even if it meant dealing with the resulting transfer speculation. Birmingham have now lost nine of their last 12 matches and McLeish, who has overseen two of those defeats since arriving earlier this month, says he will definitely bring in players next month to replace those who continue to under-perform. \"There's more quality here than some are showing, some of the players need to have a wee bit more self-belief if they want to be part of Birmingham in the Premier League,\" McLeish said. As Birmingham slip to 16th in the Premier League Bolton climb to 14th and make their manager Gary Megson's aim of finishing in the top 10 by the end of the season more realistic. He will almost certainly need Anelka and Diouf to achieve that so it is good news that at least one of them is definitely staying put.
