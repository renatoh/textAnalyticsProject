But are they being given the information they need to make a proper choice? This might seem a good time to insert relevant information into the public domain. Instead, the local government ombudsman has decided to delay publication of a list informing voters which councils have been subject to most complaints about provision of social care. It has actually drawn up a league table of the worst offenders. But we'll have to wait until after the local elections to see it. With social care such a hot potato issue, quite a curious state of affairs. \u2022 An uncomfortable day, it seems, for mayor of London Boris Johnson. He fell unusually silent when comment was sought about satirical cartoons commissioned by the campaign Clean Air In London, drawn by cartoonist Andy Davey and first revealed here. The common theme is that the mayor promised air \"alpine in its freshness\" but has achieved little. No jokes from Boris. Nothing recalling how the ancient Greeks dealt with it. An eerie quiet. Offered the chance to defend his record on ITV London, the mayor and lieutenants declined. \u2022 An email arrives, meanwhile, making much of the Tory party broadcast for the European elections. The usual knockabout stuff: \"Labour and the Lib Dems won't stand up for Britain while Ukip simply can't deliver on anything they promise.\" What stands out is that the communication comes not from PM Dave or party chair Grant Shapps, nor from Syed Kamall, Tory leader in the European parliament. It's from Beelzebub himself, the fearsome party strategist Lynton Crosby. The Aussie is styled election campaign director, which is probably his way of telling those who would meddle that he alone is the daddy. Until and unless Boris takes a more prominent role. Boris is the serial daddy, as we know. \u2022 A famous name to conjure with. The Alexander Dennis group annually makes 2,500 buses and coaches, providing 2,400 jobs. Its coach division is Plaxton Limited. Britain's biggest motoring manufacturer, this fine firm has plants in Guildford, Scarborough and Falkirk. So why is Ukip's People's Army criss-crossing the country in a Mercedes-Benz? \u2022 And as Ukip tries to explain away the presentation of a staffer as an ordinary voter in its party political broadcast, there is a wider question: how have the Farage-ians been able to get away with those inflammatory, blatantly misleading advertisements? Can they begin to prove what the ads say: that 26 million unemployed people in Europe want jobs in the UK? Naturally they cannot. And unlike commercial entities that make specific claims in banner ads, they don't have to. The ads, being political, enjoy exemption from the code, says the Advertising Standards Authority. So they can be endlessly misleading, perhaps untrue, just so long as they neither contravene election nor criminal law \u2013 and even when the claims being made make no sense. Another good reason for folk to embrace politics, isn't it? \u2022 Disappointment in north London, where the visitor scanning the lists at Highbury magistrates' court last Thursday would have seen the home secretary, Theresa May, named as one of those facing prosecution. As the ultimate head of the Independent Police Complaints Commission she was apparently up before the beak in a case brought by Camden council relating to alleged non-payment of business rates at the commission's offices. Hopes raised and dashed: the Camden New Journal, eager to see how May would look in a Guant\u00e1namo-style boiler suit, reports that with the case set down, wise heads prevailed and the matter was quietly resolved before the embarrassment of a court hearing. \"Just a bit of confusion\" is the explanation. Miscreants peddle that line every day. \u2022 Finally, sad news. Spritz Williams and Srnicek's long awaited Manifesto for Accelerationist Politics was due yesterday. It has been delayed until May.
