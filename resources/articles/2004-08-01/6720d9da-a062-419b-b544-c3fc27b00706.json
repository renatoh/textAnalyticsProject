Rooney met Moyes at the club's Bellefield training ground on Monday and expressed his desire for a transfer, with talks at an impasse over a new five-year contract and the teenager deeply upset by allegations, backed up by closed-circuit television footage, that he has visited brothels in Liverpool. Rooney is braced for further lurid revelations. That has convinced him and his adviser, Paul Stretford of the Formation Group plc, that his career - as well as his increasingly fragile relationship with his fiancee, Coleen - may be better furthered away from Merseyside. Moyes was unaware of Newcastle's interest at the time, though their initial bid of \u00a320m, swiftly rejected by Everton's chairman Bill Kenwright on Monday evening, confirmed his worst fears. The Merseyside club value the 18-year-old at \u00a330m, the price at which they were attempting to set a get-out clause in Rooney's proposed new deal, and Moyes would consider his position should Everton buckle under financial pressures and accept Newcastle's offer. That may ring as a hollow threat but Moyes, in his third full season at Goodison Park, has been dismayed by the boardroom squabbles which have severely hampered his chances of squad-strengthening this summer. Doubts remain over the viability of a potential \u00a320m investment package uncovered by Kenwright, who remains in dialogue with the Russian Zingarevich family, with the deepening rift in the Everton board between the chairman and the director Paul Gregg delaying any immediate progress. While Everton continue to flounder without that financial backing to appease their bank - they are saddled with debts approaching \u00a340m, albeit with much of that securitised, and have an overdraft limit of \u00a35m restricting their transfer clout - they will be tempted by Newcastle's offer. That bid remains on the table this morning, with Newcastle's chairman Freddy Shepherd likely to improve it before the transfer window closes next Tuesday if there has been no progress. Any improved offer might involve a player being added to the deal as a makeweight, with Newcastle believed to be willing to let Kieron Dyer, valued at \u00a38m, leave. Whether they would readjust the cash settlement remains to be seen. Shola Ameobi would effectively be fifth-choice striker if Rooney arrives and the 22-year-old must be considering his future, despite signing a new five-year contract at St James' Park this summer. Asked yesterday how Ameobi would feel should Rooney come, Sir Bobby Robson pointedly replied: \"I'm not answering that.\" Newcastle's hierarchy have reacted angrily to the widespread scepticism which greeted their bid. Yesterday they threatened legal action against one newspaper and Robson rowed in behind his chairman in support of the attempted transfer. \"All I can tell you is that the club have made a \u00a320m cash offer for Wayne Rooney,\" said Robson, whose side entertain Norwich tonight. \"I understand it's been rejected, but I also understand the chairman has left the bid on the table. Whether he [Rooney] comes in we don't know.\" Asked about the scepticism and the fact that a new centre-half post-Jonathan Woodgate is his priority, not a forward, Robson replied: \"It's \u00a320m cash - genuine - you could buy a club for that. And Rooney's not just another striker. You're talking about buying the most exciting, brilliant young player in Europe. You can't blame me for trying to do that. You should be looking to applaud the chairman, not bury him. \"Manchester United can't buy Rooney. The most famous and rich club in the country can't buy him. I know Alex [Ferguson] would love him, so why don't they make an offer?\" Robson said he has been kept informed about the possibility of a bid for Rooney since Newcastle accepted Real Madrid's \u00a313m offer for Woodgate last week. Robson also has to try to recruit a centre-half. The club is resigned to missing out on Coventry's Calum Davenport. \"We're aware of what we've lost,\" said the manager of Woodgate, \"and we're fully aware we need a replacement and we're diligently working on that issue. You will appreciate it's not easy. We're being quoted more money for some players than we received for Woodgate. \"There's a fair amount of money available, it's what we do with it. The chairman has bankrolled my judgment. We're looking for a genuine quality player. We need a steadfast, proper centre-half.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
