On a two-day trip to Belfast and the border city of Newry, the chancellor will also warn that the border with the Irish Republic \u201cwould harden\u201d if the UK voted to leave the European Union. Osborne will say Northern Ireland is \u201cparticularly vulnerable\u201d to the \u201cprofound economic shock\u201d that would shake the province in the event of a leave vote on 23 June. With polls showing consistently that Northern Ireland is the most pro-EU region of the UK, Osborne will appeal to voters to get registered and go to the ballot boxes on polling day. He will estimate that average house prices in the province would fall over two years by \u00a318,000 in the two years after the UK left the EU. Speaking in Belfast, the chancellor will say: \u201cAt the moment Northern Ireland is among the best regions of the UK when it comes to creating jobs. It\u2019s a great success story that I am confident we can build on if the UK remains in a reformed EU. \u201cBut if the UK votes to leave, every credible independent voice agrees that there would be a profound economic shock that would hurt people\u2019s jobs, livelihoods and living standards.\u201d On the impact of Brexit on the border with the Irish Republic \u2013 the only land frontier the UK has with an EU state \u2013 Osborne will say: \u201cIt is also inevitable that there would be changes to border arrangements. Leave campaigners who suggest this is not the case are simply not being straight with people. On any level, that is simply not a price worth paying.\u201d The chancellor\u2019s warning of a refortified border on the island after a leave vote echoes the concerns of former Irish prime minister Bertie Ahern. In an interview with the Guardian, the ex-taoiseach and key negotiator in securing the 1998 Good Friday agreement said a hardened border would be a catastrophe for the entire island. Ahern dismissed the assurances of Tories campaigning for a leave vote, including the Northern Ireland secretary, Theresa Villiers, that there would be no new border controls or fortifications in Ireland if the UK voted to leave the EU. \u201cVilliers keeps telling us all the time that we have a common travel agreement from 1921 that ensures freedom of movement between Irish and British people across these islands. Yet her point is wholly irrelevant in a completely different world from back then,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not talking about freedom of movement between the Irish and the British. If the UK leave the EU we are talking about both EU citizens and non-EU nations still seeking a way into Britain. And the only land border between a post-Brexit Britain and the EU is on this island.\u201d Ahern said the logic of the leave campaign in seeking to control immigration into the UK entailed strengthening the Irish border. \u201cIf you follow the logic of the likes of Boris [Johnson] on the issue of immigration, I cannot see any other way they can fulfil their promise to control the numbers coming into the UK unless they set up border controls between the north and south on this island. That would be a catastrophe in terms of business and the movement of people every single day north and south on the island,\u201d he said. The single biggest party in the Northern Ireland assembly, the Democratic Unionists, are the main force arguing for a leave vote. Sinn F\u00e9in, the Social Democratic and Labour party, the centrist Alliance party and the Ulster Unionist party are in favour of remaining within the EU. Meanwhile, one of Northern Ireland\u2019s largest public sector unions, NIPSA, voted at the weekend in favour of Brexit. At their annual conference in Enniskillen, delegates voted by a narrow margin of 68 to 58 with five abstentions to back Britain leaving the EU."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
