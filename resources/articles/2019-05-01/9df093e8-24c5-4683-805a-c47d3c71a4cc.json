Jeff Bezos\u2019s aerospace company, Blue Origin, aims to take people to the moon by 2024, he announced on Thursday. The company owned by the billionaire Amazon executive has been pushing to establish a lunar base for humans within the next five years. On Thursday, it made that goal public with the announcement of its new Blue Moon lander, an unmanned spacecraft that can carry up to 6.5 metric tons for deposit on the moon, allowing it to lay the framework for future human missions. The company has been developing the technology for three years, Bezos said. During his hour-long presentation at Washington DC\u2019s convention center, Bezos waved his arm and a black drape behind him dropped to reveal the two-story-tall unmanned lander mockup, which he said can deploy up to four smaller rovers and shoot out satellites to orbit the moon. \u201cWe have been given a gift \u2013 this nearby body called the moon,\u201d Bezos said, listing factors that make the moon a good target for space travel, including its proximity to earth, low gravity and ice content. In March, the vice-president, Mike Pence, called on Nasa to build a space platform in lunar orbit and put American astronauts on the moon\u2019s south pole by 2024 \u201cby any means necessary\u201d, four years earlier than previously planned. \u201cI love this,\u201d Bezos said of Pence\u2019s timeline. \u201cWe can help meet that timeline but only because we started three years ago. It\u2019s time to go back to the moon, this time to stay.\u201d Blue Origin touted the announcement as a chance to \u201cshare our vision of going to space to benefit Earth\u201d. In addition to announcing the moon lander, Bezos spoke at the event about his hopes to create floating spacecraft for human colonies in the future, an idea he has touted in the past. He shared mock-ups of O\u2019Neill cylinders, conceptual space colonies proposed by the physicist Gerard O\u2019Neill that would rotate to simulate gravity and be able to sustain human and plant life. \u201cThis is Maui on its best day, all year long,\u201d Bezos said. \u201cNo rain. No earthquakes. People are going to want to live here.\u201d Privately held Blue Origin, based in Kent, Washington, is developing its New Shepard rocket for short space tourism trips and a heavy-lift launch rocket called New Glenn for satellite launch contracts. It is aiming to deliver the New Glenn rocket by 2021, while launching humans in a suborbital flight later this year atop its rocket-and-capsule New Shepard. The company has conducted several successful launches of New Shepard. The news comes as Elon Musk also develops plans to bring humans to Mars with his company SpaceX. Musk previously set the first cargo-carrying Mars mission for 2022 and a crewed mission for 2024."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
