Top stories The Coalition\u2019s plan to flatten tax brackets for middle- to high-income earners will provide twice as much benefit to men than women, a new analysis has found. The analysis by the Australia Institute, released today, found that in 2024-25, the first year of the third stage of the government\u2019s tax plan, men will pocket $11bn in income tax cuts while women receive just $6bn. Income tax cuts are the first order of business when parliament resumes in the first week of July but the Coalition and Labor are locked in a high-stakes game of chicken, with both warning cuts for low- and middle-income earners should not be delayed by political posturing over the final stage. \u201cThe Coolwell sisters are not sure when their grief and loss will end,\u201d write Lorena Allam and Taylor Fuller. \u201cThey have lost two brothers through deaths in custody, and even though both men have been the subject of a coronial inquest \u2013 one released just this week \u2013 the family still doesn\u2019t have the answers they need to heal and move on.\u201d Bradley Coolwell and his younger brother, Shaun, both troubled and in poor health, died after being restrained face down by police and hospital guards. \u201cIt was the same house, the same hospital,\u201d their sister Sonya says. \u201cWe are never going to heal. There\u2019s no justice, so there\u2019s no healing.\u201d Starting on Wednesday, those suffering from a terminal illness in Victoria will be able to ask their doctor for lethal drugs that will allow them to end their own lives. The scheme, which the premier, Daniel Andrews, described as the most \u201cconservative in the world\u201d, has already received 100 inquiries. Campaigners have suggested the introduction of Victoria\u2019s laws could pave the way for change in other states. \u201cWe anticipate in the first 12 months, based on overseas experience, around a dozen people that will access voluntary assisted dying, and we think that number will settle at around 100 to 150 per year in the years after,\u201d Andrews said. World Organisers claimed that nearly 2 million people turned out for protests in Hong Kong on Sunday, which would make the demonstration the largest in the city\u2019s history. The sea of protesters, most dressed in black and carrying white flowers of mourning, swept through central Hong Kong to denounce a controversial extradition law and demand that the city\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, steps down. Major global firms have been accused of concealing their environmental impact. A US$10tn (A$14.6tn) investor alliance has accused more than 700 companies, including Amazon, Tesco and ExxonMobil, of failing to reveal the full extent of their impact on the climate crisis, water shortages and deforestation. The campaign platform CDP has brought together a record number of investors, including banking giants HSBC and Investec, to demand companies reveal data on the environmental cost of how they do business. Sara Netanyahu, the wife of Israel\u2019s prime minister, has been convicted of illegally misusing thousands of dollars of public funds on lavish meals. Benjamin Netanyahu still faces the prospect of three corruption indictments later this year that may end his decade as leader and even result in a prison sentence. He denies all charges. The UK and Russia are examining the scope for a thaw in relations, including the possibility of a meeting between Vladimir Putin and Theresa May at the G20 leaders\u2019 summit in Japan. If a meeting were to go ahead it would be the first encounter at this level since the poisoning in Salisbury of Sergei Skripal and his daughter in March last year. Days after the 25th anniversary of the murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman, OJ Simpson has reportedly launched a Twitter account. In the account, there is a video post in which the former football star, who was the prime suspect in the murders and ultimately acquitted of the crime after a televised trial, says he has got a \u201clittle gettin\u2019 even to do\u201d. Opinion and analysis As half of the band KLF, Jimmy Cauty created a crop circle of the group\u2019s logo, buried a Brit award in a field near Stonehenge and, infamously, set \u00a31m on fire. But for his installation at the seventh Dark Mofo, he has created a dystopian diorama housed in a 40ft shipping container. He then recruited an army of children in hoodies from Hobart to be the \u201cChildren of the Aftermath\u201d \u2013 the stewards and tour guides of his creation. \u201cAgriculture needs to be driven by environmentalists,\u201d writes Patrice Newell in her book Who\u2019s Minding the Farm? \u201cThat statement, I know, scares a lot of people. Even among progressive farmers, the word \u2018environmentalist\u2019 is problematic and divisive.\u201d But, Newell writes, \u201cEnvironmental policy must begin at the farm gate because it\u2019s farmers who own the land, the soil \u2013 or at least that land that isn\u2019t mortgaged to the banks \u2013 and they\u2019re the people who need to undertake the repair work.\u201d Sport Essendon\u2019s 19-point victory over the Hawks at Marvel Stadium will go abundantly overlooked, writes Justin Robertson, after Hawthorn\u2019s captain, Ben Stratton, launched a pinching spree at Bombers small forward Orazio Fantasia. It was a jarring act that sent the defender directly to the tribunal charged with serious misconduct \u2013 and outraged the football community. The Matildas coach, Ante Milicic, may have been subjected to some criticism, but it is his players who need the thickest of skins, given the daily abuse they have to endure, Joey Peters writes in her latest Women\u2019s World Cup column for Guardian Australia. \u201cSo it was a breath of fresh air to see Sam Kerr call out her \u2018haters\u2019 after the match against Brazil. The last time I checked, sexuality has nothing to do with how she plays, and it\u2019s reassuring that players are willing to speak out as honestly off the pitch as they play on it.\u201d Thinking time: HBO\u2019s Chernobyl only scratches the surface. \u201cThere is a line in the television series Chernobyl that comes as no surprise to those of us who reported on the 1986 nuclear disaster in what was the Soviet Union \u2013 but that still has the power to shock, writes Kim Willsher: \u201c\u2018The official position of the state is that global nuclear catastrophe is not possible in the Soviet Union.\u2019 It was not possible, so in the days and months after the world\u2019s worst such accident, on 26 April, the Kremlin kept up its pretence. It dissembled, deceived and lied. \u201cI began investigating Chernobyl in the late 1980s after Ukrainian friends insisted authorities in the USSR were covering up the extent of the human tragedy of those \u2013 many of them children \u2013 contaminated by radiation when the nuclear plant\u2019s Reactor 4 exploded, blasting a cloud of poisonous fallout across the USSR and a large swathe of Europe. When photographer John Downing and I first visited, the Soviet Union, then on its last political legs, was still in denial about what happened despite president Mikhail Gorbachev\u2019s new era of glasnost. The Chernobyl miniseries is a compelling account of how the disaster unfolded, based largely on the testimony of those present, most of whom died soon afterwards. It rings true but only scratches the surface of another, more cruel reality \u2013 that, in their desperation to save face, the Soviets were willing to sacrifice any number of men, women and children.\u201d Media roundup The Australian Financial Review reports that poorer students are not being prepared for work or university by the school system. The former rugby union star Israel Folau used a sermon at his church to claim the devil was behind children being able to change gender, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. The ABC reveals that the central plank of the Morrison government\u2019s climate policy \u201cinvolves pouring billions of extra dollars into an emissions reduction program that\u2019s not spending its existing funding\u201d. Coming up The legal battle between VicForests and Friends of Leadbeater\u2019s Possum over logging in Victoria\u2019s central highlands comes to the federal court. Police will update the media about search for the missing Belgian backpacker Theo Hayez, who was last seen in Byron Bay.
