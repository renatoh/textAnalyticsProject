Instead, she presented her new collection to small groups of three visitors at a time, in the same Hoxton art gallery where she had planned to hold the show. Monogrammed silk \u201cVB\u201d face masks were presented to each visitor, to ensure chic social distancing was maintained at all times. \u201cI was really looking forward to having a show and to the social element of that, after such a long period of not seeing anyone,\u201d the designer said. The intention had been to stage several shows spaced at intervals through a day, each with an audience of 15 people masked and seated 2 metres apart. \u201cI am hoping that next season we will get back to something a bit normal. And maybe have a glass of wine,\u201d Beckham said. Lockdown loungewear \u2013 but done with signature Beckham glam \u2013 is the new look, with jeans making their first ever appearance in the brand\u2019s main collection. \u201cI lived in vintage jeans all the way through lockdown,\u201d Beckham said. \u201cAlthough I will have you know that I never once turned to an elasticated waist, except for in the gym.\u201d High-waisted, wide-legged jeans \u2013 think Jane Birkin circa 1971 \u2013 are to be worn with oversized silk shirts. Hard hit by months of store closures and weak sales, the brand is downsizing. About a fifth of Beckham\u2019s 120-strong team have been made redundant, and the number of pieces in this collection has been cut by more than half in order to streamline production costs. Just 20 outfits feature in the video of this season\u2019s collection, compared to the 46 shown on the catwalk in February. Online sales are rebounding, but \u201cthe store is challenging. I think people just aren\u2019t physically going shopping,\u201d said the designer. The new collection skews towards the kind of clothes that can be relied upon to seduce the Victoria Beckham customer. There are lots of dresses \u2013 a strappy lilac silk overlaid at the bodice with a halter in fine black lace was a standout \u2013 along with sharp tailoring and luxurious silk and knit separates. After last season\u2019s flirtation with shorter skirts, the long hemline that is a Beckham trademark is back. The brand has perfected a hit formula that bridges edgy cool and commercial appeal, giving her brand fashion pedigree while pleasing a customer who wants to look pretty, as well as interesting. These are clothes that win compliments from fashion people and non-fashion people alike. A Parisian-style trenchcoat, for instance, is made quirky by being layered under a padded gilet, which Beckham calls \u201ca petrol station puffer\u201d. Knit pieces are imprinted with \u201claundry press\u201d creases, like those found on a freshly unboxed shirt. \u201cIt looks interesting, and it creates a more flattering shape on the body,\u201d she explains. The lockdown hobby of the designer\u2019s husband also makes itself felt. A blazer is \u201cbanana\u201d, a ruffle-trimmed polo neck comes in \u201ccreme brulee\u201d, trousers are \u201chollandaise\u201d, in Beckham\u2019s descriptions. \u201cA lot of the references are food-related because David\u2019s been doing so much cooking,\u201d she said. The designer\u2019s offspring lined up on the front row has become a London fashion week tradition, but this season they came to the gallery to watch the collection video being filmed instead. \u201cThis season is different in lots of ways, but the Beckhams still got their fashion day out,\u201d said the designer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
