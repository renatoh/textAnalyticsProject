No one. Fearless Baltimore took it to Tom Brady and the Pats in their own backyard, and that is exactly why you want to avoid emotional wild card teams on a roll. We've seen this show before and here it is again, this time in purple, as Baltimore celebrate a return to the Super Bowl in two weeks time. There will be day after day to examine, re-examine and then re-re-re examine every aspect of the big game at the end of the season, the HarBowl as it will be known. And when we kick off SB 47, we'll be there live, just as we've been every game of the NFL playoffs. For now however, for all of us at the Guardian, thanks for reading, and good night! Ray Lewis is surrounded by every camera person in the entire Untied States, and its territories, as time expires on the Patriots season but not Lewis' career. He will have one last day in the sun...or dome, the Super Dome that is, on February 3rd when his Ravens take on the San Francisco 49ers in a match-up that makes sense - the hottest teams in the NFL to decide the champion! Orestes Ippeau is not a happy camper... \"Super Bowl Ex El Vee Eye Eye will be HARBAUSHOW, HARBAUGHILL, HARBAUGHFYING, HARBAUGHFIC, HARBAUGH-ONB-HARBAUGHACTION.\" Williams picks Brady in the endzone and that will do it! The Pats QB completes his disastrous second half with an interception and Baltimore will face San Francisco in Super Bowl 47 in two weeks time - we have a HarBowl! Oh boy... Brady is hit as he throws incomplete at the Ravens 33. Then McPhee tips another pass! The Ravens are not softening up as we play out the string. Hernandez has it on the far sideline for a first down and Brady spikes the ball to stop the clock. Lot's of erupting about to happen down in Charm City, and with reason... Our wo(man) in Bmore better take cover! Warning, this half has two minutes remaining, and that's all the time between the Ravens and Ray Lewis returning to the Super Bowl! More antipodean NFL fans, this time it's Jamal Poleta: \"Checkin\u2019 in from Sydney, Australia. You know we Ravens Fans have got this in the bag! Confidence Much?! HELL YEAH! RaveNation All Day!\" Tick tock it won't stop. The Ravens run run run, which is smart. They get a first down, and Belichick is defiant, refusing to call timeouts. That will show them! Baltimore has a pair of first down, after running six straight plays. This thing is all but over. Well, it looks that way right now, yes. I've been there before, staying up crazy hours to watch your team take a hammering. The next day is no fun. The play stands, which was obvious, and the Ravens start it up on their own 18-yard line. Let's see if they do a bit of running, which I and anyone else who is even remotely functional, would recommend. Brady has a wide open Welker - huge gain in the open field for 36 yards but in the next play... Pernell McPhee tips Brady's pass! Ellerbe has it! The play is under review however...stand by. Orestes Ippeau isn't happy with the Ravens style of play. \"Baltimore Headhunters dooming the NFL\" Flacco is throwing down field, and I have no idea why. Remember what happened to Ryan when he did that with a big lead against Seattle? Why not run, run, run? Crazy. Three and out, Ravens punt it away. These people are crazy. Pats start at their 40. Brady in the shotgun, flushed out of the pocket and throws weakly into the endzone across his body. The Pats all-world QB looked more like Mike Cherry there. Awful - really, really bad. Baltimore are as close to returning to the Super Bowl as they are ever going to get - just under 8:30 between them and New Orleans. Just run rice, pick up a few first downs, and get the heck out of there. Brady has the Pats inside the 20 after finding Branch over the middle. They might have been closer to the endzone, but a wide open Vereen has the dropsies after a screen pass. Big 3rd &amp; 4, it's incomplete! So that sets up a 4th down, and NE have to go for it... Vereen has a Brady pass for nine yards and takes it close to midfield. Then on 3rd &amp; 1 he's back for seven more, this time on the ground. Pats on the move, without Ridley who will not return after the head injury. Tough break for New England and their RB there. Bang-bang! Boldin again! A confident Flacco marches right down the field and four plays later the Ravens are in the endzone when he finds Boldin, again, who celebrates after toasting Cole! That's two Bmore TD's in 1:33! Now the Pats hurry-up has to hurry-up a lot more to get back in this game, which is still in reach, believe it or not. We've seen it all in the NFL and this is certainly still possible. The Pats running back was crushed on that play, and he is being taken in for concussion symptoms. There's a huge pile up after Ridley coughs it up! That's the big play we've been waiting for, the one that New England desperately needed on defense, but unfortunately for them, it's Baltimore who make it happen. Ravens take over on the Pats 47. But... I have to completely disagree there. You kick the extra-point and force them to have to convert a two-point conversion if the Pats get in the endzone. If Baltimore don't get the two and the Pats scored the game is tied. One mans opinion, how about yours? david.lengel.freelance@guardiannews.com and/or tweet @lengeldavid Flacco finds a leaping Boldin over the middle for the TD! Tremendous pass and catch there by the Bmore folks who are gaining strength as the game reaches it's final stages! Still, the Patriots are a TD and two-point conversion from tying this game and there is a lot of clock on the clock. Another two first downs - this time it's Rice who ends the quarter by setting up a first and goal with a little two-yard run. Well, New England need to make a play here as Baltimore are imposing their will on the home team right now. When we resume, Ravens on the Pats three. Flacco looks for Torrey Smith again, but can't find him in the endzone. It's 3rd &amp; 2 and it looks like they have Pierce behind the line of scrimmage, but he quickly cuts outside and finds room! Great execution on a play that could have gone wrong - it's another Ravens first down, and they are at the Pats 19 after Flacco finds Pitta for six more! Here come the Ravens on the move once more. Flacco is picking up steam and has the rhythm that Brady has been looking for. A 23-yard gain on 2nd &amp; 14 to Smith has Baltimore into New England territory. You said it Hunter. You could even hear the air come out of the ball as it hit the ground there. A confused crowd right now. Oh those penalties. They get a first down after Brady hits Woodhead, but an offensive holding penalty on Solder turns that into a 3rd and 12, which turns into a punt after Brady throws to Hernandez who wasn't looking for the ball! A killer sequence there for the Pats. Brady has been off his game ever so slightly tonight. Perhaps that will be the difference? Ravens start at their own 37. More from down south... ...the moment Flacco found Pitta. Flacco, hangs in the pocket and finds Pitta, complete, IN THE ENDZONE! The Ravens have climbed ahead of New England here in the third quarter after a 87-yard drive that lasts a bit under four minutes! Tremendous job by Flacco who had a couple of key passes in tough spots during that series. Boldin sticks it to Cole, over the middle for the catch, and another Ravens first down! It's first &amp; goal and the 10! Pitta is open in the middle of the field and chews up a decent chunk of turf, 22 yards, after picking up steam. Then Flacco goes for it all TO SMITH! Incomplete! Was he interfered with? No! Good work in the secondary. Rice has it now, it's a screen pass. He finds some room, beats a tackle and storms ahead for a Ravens first down! It's a 15-yard gain for Rice who is shakin' and bakin' to the Pats 35. Bmore on the move... So are most fans in Baltimore. Flacco's flings are few and far between tonight. He is just 7/18 for 107 yards thus far! Meanwhile, Brady is 17/29 for 174. Welker drops the ball, wide open, on 3rd &amp; 8! Did that really happen? I think it did. Yes, it did. Holy moly! So that means that the Ravens escape further damage with Mesko coming out to kick it away, as Reed calls for a fair catch on the 13. A lot of action in the second half, but, at the same time, nothing happening at all. Hmm.... Hernandez has his eighth catch before Welker gets DESTROYED by Pollard and Graham! But he still has the football, 24 yards later, and Graham gets called for a personal foul, even though it was Pollard who was guilty, which tacks on another 15 yards. Do the math: 24+15 = Pats at the Baltimore 36. More from our (wo)man in Bmore... This is definitely what is missing from my life right now! SOS! Send nachos to Brooklyn, stat! More 3rd &amp; long action, and this time Flacco can't find his man, which was Smith. That's the bad news for the Ravens. The good news is that Kock has the Pats on their own nine-yard line after a 41-yard punt that Welker waived the white flag on. It's a small world af-ter all... On 3rd and 9, Flacco throws a jump ball for Boldin and he's got it! Key first down there - a 26 yard gain to the Pats 48. Those are some really bad high fives. No way Hunter is happy with that. Apologies for the bad aspect ratio.... So the Ravens kept it close on the road, which is exactly what they want. New England are ahead in nearly every major statistical category, including the score, but they won't be happy with a lead of six lousy points unless the clock says 0:00. We haven't seen these offenses break out and we haven't seen the big play - a pick, fumble, a block or some kind of pyrotechnics. It's only a matter of time before something big happens that defines this game, and sends one of these teams to New Orleans, don't you think? Do tell... david.lengel.freelance@guardiannews.com and/or tweet @lengeldavid After the chip shot field goal, The Ravens head coach comes out and has a chippy interview with the CBS sidleine reporter. He said they have nothing to be concerned about, they're down by six, these games go down to the wire. Asked what he will tell his team at halftime \"To go out and win a ballgame.\" More great insight from sideline interviews. I defy you to name a moment when you heard a coach give a sideline interview and your thought was \"Wow, that was great, I really got some phenomenal insight there.\" I suspect I will be waiting for quite some time... Gostkowski comes out and kicks a 25-yard chip shot and the half is over. It could have worse for the Ravens who are well into this dogfight in hostile territory. Brady scrambles for three yards, but it kills clock and they don't call time until there are four ticks left in the half. Bad bad time management there from Belichick! Loads of time for Brady who fires a freight train of a pass to Branch but it's out of the endzone! Ravens Smith and Reed collide on the play, which looked really bad. The Ravens look even worse after Hernandez beats Kruger, a tough match-up, and the Pats TE has 17 yards down to the 10! First &amp; goal. Pats can't convert on 3rd &amp; short then they go for it on 4th down!! It's a direct snap to Woodhead! He runs for seven yards and a first down on the Ravens 34! That worked out well for Belichick, and now New England are on the 27 with two time outs after burning their first. Actually, it's looking like Baltimore need to take it...back, as the Pats are looked great on those previous two sequences. Meanwhile, we've reached two-minute warning. Momentum shift! On 3rd &amp; 6 the Pats get to Flacco, for the first time this season so say CBS as he was not sacked during their game in week three. Ravens punt it away, Welker is there and he runs it out of bounds at the Bmore 43, so great field position for New England who will be looking to open up this can of tuna. Charles Ponzi is defiant! \"The Pats are living on borrowed time and Ray Lewis is gonna collect\" Welker makes everyone look bad, he is unstoppable! Third time is a charm! After two big stops, Wes Welker plays with the defense on the right side of the endzone - he is wide open because of a mix-up in the Bmore secondary! That's 80 yards in the blink of an eye from Brady and the Pats who will gain confidence by slicing through the Ravens defense after being unable to take advantage of some early game progress. Thanks to a personal foul on Ellerbe, and Wes Welker, who catches and runs, wildly fast through the Baltimore defense in the middle of the field, the Patriots get down to the Baltimore 16, bang-bang! Hernandez has a Brady throw and he is down to the one! Can they pound it into the endzone? I don't care what you're wearing as long as you email or tweet. david.lengel.freelance@guardiannews.com @lengeldavid So the Ravens go 90 yards after doing nothing in the first quarter. With the way Baltimore's defense is playing, that's a great sign for those crazy people down in Charm City. Still, very, very early of course, Our woman in Bmore has filed this photo featuring a defiant, and now presumably very pleased Ravens fan watching her team try to reach the Super Bowl in New Orleans. Rice, runs left, bounces off two really bad tackles and is in the endzone! Fantastic drive into the wind by Flacco and the Ravens! We await the extra point with the Pats safety Patrick Chung down with an injury. Ravens are on the move, finally. Pitta, Pierce and Rice combine for 36 yards in receptions while Baltimore pick up three first downs and cross midfield for the first time today. Ravens on the New England 40. Did I say 40? I meant the 15! Flacco finds a Smith streaking across the field for a gain of 25 before Rice powers through for eight yards. Agreed, that is a signifigant injury to an already porous Pats defensive backfield. A wild play on 3rd &amp; 2! Cary Williams pops the ball as Brady looks for Lloyd and it goes flying towards Paul Kruger who nearly has the pick. It falls to the ground harmlessly and we have another punt, the sixth of the quarter. Rice runs for three up to his own 13 to close out the quarter. New England have had the bulk of the plays form scrimmage and have had the ball for 10:40 out of the first 15:00, but only have three points to show for it. Flacco needs to do what Brady is doing, shorter throws with wideouts trying to make something happen after the catch rather than going for the home run. Pierce gets back-to-back touches, breaking through for 11 yards and then three more before Flacco rolls to his right and fires for Ed Dixon who should have made the catch! Another 3rd &amp; long and Flacco goes deep and Pitta is wide open - he dives and can't make the catch. That throw wasn't accurate - very poor from Flacco and Bmore punt. Great return from the explosive Welker! He gets close to midfield, so the Pats gain a big chunk of ground in this battle of field position. Brady is looking for Lloyd again, and he dives and has his arms around the ball but it falls to the ground and New England punt it down to the baltimore seven yard line. So some tough field position for the Ravens who haven't done a thing on offense while their defense has held up well against the Pats attack. Ray Lewis is flagged for leading with his head on a catch close to midfield, that's a personal foul and it sends the Pats to the Ravens 36. Then Jones gets to Brady as he looks for Hernandez and fires incomplete before Vereen gets just a yard. That means a big 3rd &amp; 9 coming up. Can you imagine what the two weeks of HAR-bowl coverage would be like? That's two weeks of interviews with their parents, elementary school teachers, high-school coaches. Oh man, I may have to go to a mountain somewhere until game day. Meanwhile, Talib heads to the lockers...he did well with Boldin, depending on how long he sits, that cold become a factor. Flacco finds the big man, Vonta Leach, who waddles for 17 yards before Rice finds about nine feet on the next play. Then Flacco goes DEEP...but it's over the head of Boldin by about four yards. He went looking for the one-on-one coverage but came up empty. 3rd &amp; long coming up and flags fly, it's a false start. Now it's 3rd and really long, 3rd &amp; 13 and Flacco looks for Boldin again and Talib is there to make the stop, forcing the Ravens to kick it away. Talib grabs his hammy after the play FYI... NE will start on their own 33. Somebody call 911! I mean, you can't shut out someone from Tazzie right? In the last of the predictions Martin Street registers his thoughts: \"Having enjoyed considerable time in New England I am backing the Pats to take this game 31-20\" Looks like sentimentality is figuring into Martin's prediction, always dangerous. The Ravens hold, but the Pats are on the board first. Ridley is bottled up on 3rd &amp; 2 and Gostkowski comes out to hammer home a 31-yard FG putting the home team up. No wind issues on that kick. Brady again has time on 3rd &amp; 2, and this time Brady's fires a bullet to Brandon Lloyd that no wind can push around. He definitely turned it up a notch there. Pats on the move here - a pass to Hernandez for ten yards, and then another 16, back to Lloyd again. They're at the Ravens 20. Their home record is brilliant, mostly because the Pats are brilliant, perhaps not because Foxboro is some kind of intimidating cauldron for visitors, in my opinion at least. Bob Davies likes Bmore tonight, but maybe both of us were a bit crazy with the points considering the wind. Anyway, Bob's final score is: Ravens 35 Patriots 31 Meanwhile, down in Auckland, NZ, Lee Cartwright checks in: \"Cheering on the Pats \u2018quietly\u2019 here at work in Auckland NZ. My prediction 41-28\" Three and out for the Ravens, as the wind again seemed to be a bit of a factor when he tried to dump it off to Rice on 3rd &amp; 4. It's incomplete, but even if he'd caught it, the Pats had him surrounded. Baltimore punt it away, and the Pats rack up two holding calls on the play meaning NE will begin in their won 21. Quiet start, the teams are feeling each other out it seems and the wind is messing them around a bit I'd say. Bill Belichick puts the punt team out after scaring the crap out of the Ravens special teams. Bmore will start on their own 13. Stevan Ridley has his first touch and has a bit of room up the middle, then Brady finds Aaron Hernandez for nine yards and a first down. Ridley wiggles for seven more over two carries and on 3rd &amp; 2 Brady goes downfield for Welker - incomplete! The wind seemed to have its way with the old pigskin there - that's 4th down... BUT WAIT! The Pats are going for it - backup QB Ryan Mallett under center and the Ravens call for time! We are up and away, as is the ball, which flies out of the endzone. Here comes Brady to begin on the Patriots own 20-yard line. Baltimore won the toss and deferred, so New England will be receiving to start tonight. Wind is definitely whipping away in Expensive Razor Stadium. Not sure why a country group are performing in Massachusetts, but Gloriana put on a serviceable performance. Nothing crazy, but I'd give them a 6.5/10. Now, are you ready for some football? From a fashion point of view, I think the 49ers away uniforms with their red numbers on white with gold bottoms would just pop very well with the home of the Ravens purple tops, don't you? Unfortunately, you can't make predictions based on your selfish thoughts on what would look best on camera at the Super Dome in New Orleans. However, in this case I'm lucky because I actually think the Ravens will win tonight. I don't rate Foxboro as a tough place to play, and I love a wild card team on an emotional roller coaster, which is exactly what the Ravens are. For that reason alone they are capable, never mind that they have more than enough talent to win in a big spot on the road against a well heeled Pats team that has one of the greatest quarterbacks to ever dance on a float at carnival in Rio. Yeah, so, Ravens in a thriller, 31-27. Do you have a prediction? Of course you do - talk to me... david.lengel.freelance@guardiannews.com and/or tweet @lengeldavid Tony is correct, and you get the idea if my 97-year-old grandma Molly lined up for New England at TE she would be productive - actually, she would probably have a slight edge on Gronk. Yes, I would expect so. They really, really love their football in Bmore - it's hard to imagine a more loyal bunch, one reason why they were so devastated when the Colts left. Cleveland were also devastated when that franchise picked up and moved to Charm City, but more because they had no one left to yell rather than having no one left to love. You would think that January would bring its share of weather problems in a place like Foxboro, Massachusetts. However, we are not even below freezing, and there is no threat of a snow bowl at all, which is a bit disappointing for a neutral who enjoys a messy championship game. However, the wind is a blowing, at roughly 17 miles an hour depending on which website you trust, with some hefty gusts possible, so maybe it plays a bit of a factor. Ray Lewis this, Ray Lewis that. Is the 17-year linebacker the emotional leader of the Baltimore Raves team? Without a doubt. Could the Ravens have gotten there without him? Almost definitely. Lewis garners a great deal of attention thanks to a Hall-of-Fame career in its dying days, but make no mistake - this is a dangerous, well rounded team that is playing for a Super Bowl right now because of its quarterback, Joe Flacco. The Ravens QB just wins, season after season and is never on anyones top list of anything. However, how many quarterbacks made the playoffs in their first five seasons, putting up a 7-4 record? To be involved in no fewer than 11 post-season games (even if he is 0-2 in AFC title contests) at this point in his career is no less than staggering, and his 12th should be a doozy when he leads his men in a grudge match against the New England Patriots in Foxboro. Flaccco and company narrowly missed out on a shot at the Giants in the Super Bowl last season after Pats safety Sterling Moore knocked the potentially game-wining pass from the hands of Lee Evans, and then Billy Cundiff choked on a 32-yard field goal attempt that would have sent the game into overtime. Well, if anyone in that game ever wanted a second chance to do things differently then here is their chance, as the two teams will play for a spot in the Super Bowl for the second consecutive season. Tom Brady's crew are looking to reach the promised land for a sixth time in 11 seasons, which is a lot in this league. They'll be leaning on their finely tuned offense (they led the league in scoring with 557 points by a country mile) once again to get them over the hump (without Rob Gronkowski I should add), as the days of New England having a robust defense are about as long gone as the days of their hoisting the Lombardi trophy. Against the run, New England are slightly above average, nothing to write home certainly, and so Ray Rice should have some room to roam while Flacco should, in theory at least, be able to do whatever he likes with the Pats-y's in their secondary. For Baltimore, really, if they can find a way to do something, anything, to limit Wes Welker, it would be a miracle, and likely the key to a would be victory, because no one else can seem to derail New Englands's wicked wideout - a difference maker for New England. These teams also met in week three, with the Ravens rallying to win 31-30, so there seems to be a habit of high-octane thrillers between these two teams. It's a rivalry with quality in every corner, and of course, on the sidelines with John Harbaugh trying to reach his first Super Bowl and Bill Belichick bidding to get back, again, for what seems like the umpteenth time. We'll have my prediction soon, and then all the action following kickoff as we learn who will face the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XLVII, or 47 as we know it outside the Vatican (time to kill the numbers isn't it?). Until then, sit back, relax, put your feet up, stretch out, make yourself at home, take a load off, and of course, write: david.lengel.freelance@guardiannews.com and/or tweet @lengeldavid Please stand by..."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
