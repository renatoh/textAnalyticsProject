Nixon is fast approaching his 20th anniversary in Leeds and the company \u2013 originally based in a former church hall in Manchester\u2019s Moss Side \u2013 celebrates its 50th birthday this month. The sense of rehearsal-room democracy is, he believes, one of its defining features. Today\u2019s dancers \u201chave a lot that they can personally contribute\u201d, says Nixon. \u201cThey are a part of, rather than serving, the art form.\u201d We meet on a busy morning at Northern Ballet\u2019s purpose-built, six-storey base in the cultural quarter of Quarry Hill. On the ground floor, children fill up the foyer awaiting a performance of Little Red Riding Hood, a sweet introduction to ballet with a colourful design, sprightly live music and a rather soppy wolf. On the floors above, dancers are taking morning class and Nixon has been viewing test footage for the company\u2019s first live broadcast of Dracula, staged at the newly reopened Leeds Playhouse up the road. The camera\u2019s close-ups show off the dancers\u2019 dramatic skills, he enthuses, but the trick is to avoid spoiling the production\u2019s illusions. These are hectic times for the touring company. \u201cWe did Cinderella two weeks ago, had one week back at base to prepare the mixed bill for the Linbury [in London], then in between we\u2019re doing Dracula,\u201d Nixon explains. Juggling this sort of workload means the dancers have to keep several contrasting performances \u201cin their veins\u201d he says, then grins. \u201cThat\u2019s a bad choice of words!\u201d His version of Bram Stoker\u2019s novel, with its bloodsucker in a bat-shaped cloak, is a crowd-pleaser that vamps up the gothic and erotic, yet has hauntingly anguished encounters such as Dracula and Mina\u2019s bedroom pas de deux danced to Arvo P\u00e4rt\u2019s Spiegel im Spiegel. \u201cOddly enough, sometimes people come to the ballet thinking everything\u2019s going to be Swan Lake,\u201d observes Nixon. \u201cThat Dracula will be Swan Lake with fangs. Well, no, Dracula will be Dracula.\u201d The company is known for these full-length narrative dances, dating back to founder Laverne Meyer\u2019s Aladdin in 1974, and continuing with Gillian Lynne\u2019s A Simple Man (about LS Lowry), a highlight of the transformative artistic directorship of Christopher Gable, and on to Nixon\u2019s own versions of Madame Butterfly, Dangerous Liaisons and Cleopatra. \u201cThe stories give us a clear identity,\u201d says Nixon. \u201cWhether you like Northern Ballet or not, you would be able to say what the company is \u2026 Sometimes today, in ballet companies, their identity is very similar to another five or six ballet companies. The same rep, pretty much the same way of approaching it. I like to think that when we take on even abstract work [such as in the mixed bill that toured to the Linbury] we take it on in a Northern Ballet way.\u201d Stories are central to the three world premieres that Nixon is unveiling for the 2020 season: Geisha, Merlin and a yet-to-be-named children\u2019s ballet (the latest in a successful line for junior audiences that have had popular CBeebies broadcasts). Geisha and Merlin, he says, are essentially \u201cboth original stories. So often we\u2019re doing adaptations but my whole thing has been: can we get to a point where we are creating the stories?\u201d Drew McOnie, the livewire theatre choreographer of King Kong, In the Heights and Jesus Christ Superstar, was commissioned to work his magic on the legendary wizard and the result is \u201cnot Merlin as you would have foreseen it\u201d says Nixon. The show will explore how the wizard got his powers and his struggle to determine how to use his magic for good. McOnie has said that he greeted an email from Nixon inviting him for a coffee, years ago, as if it were a marriage proposal. Merlin will be his first professional ballet creation: \u201cThe opportunity for a theatre choreographer to be welcomed into a space like this and into a company is incredibly rare,\u201d McOnie acknowledges. Geisha is Northern Ballet\u2019s second full-length commission for choreographer Kenneth Tindall, who started out as a child dancer with the company, and whose Casanova premiered in 2017. The anniversary celebrations include further tour dates for The Great Gatsby and Little Red Riding Hood, and the launch of a digital archive, to be gradually expanded. Archive manager Hari Jonkers has been steadily sorting through boxes of material charting the company\u2019s history. In original proposal documents, founder Laverne Meyer (like Nixon, a Canadian former dancer), writes: \u201cFor too long, areas outside London have been served by touring companies which, although they often inspire great enthusiasm during their visits, can only be present in each centre for a short time. Such visits can only impinge briefly on local life and cannot hope to develop regular audiences.\u201d The archive has handwritten logbooks of visits to the various theatres and school halls where Northern Dance Theatre, as it was first known, performed. There is promotional material trumpeting \u201cthe north\u2019s own ballet company\u201d which comprised 11 dancers \u2013 seven women, four men \u2013 and now has four times that number. There are glamorous shots of Northern\u2019s illustrious artist laureate, Rudolf Nureyev, in 1986 and desperate campaigning letters from that decade, railing against proposed Arts Council cuts. A look through the company\u2019s posters reveals a striking consistency of vision: the same company that staged dance-drama The Bront\u00ebs in 1995 went on to perform Nixon\u2019s version of Wuthering Heights in 2003 and recently enjoyed one of its biggest hits with another prestigious literary adaptation, Cathy Marston\u2019s Jane Eyre. From the start, Meyer\u2019s policy for the company stressed the importance of their work being seen on television as well as in theatres and schools. These days, that has expanded to include the cinema, which helps dance reach new audiences but has its own limitations. It\u2019s difficult for dancers to see themselves on screen, says Nixon. \u201cThe only way we can [do so] is through looking at a video. But a video is dead compared with a performance. It\u2019s never what the performance was.\u201d Among its further plans to put performance online and push the art form forward, while also perhaps recognising the habits of its future audiences, the company has commissioned Tindall to choreograph a \u201cdirect to digital\u201d creation. Filmed this month, with a working title of Ego, it will premiere online on Northern Ballet\u2019s Digital Dance website and is not designed to be performed in theatres. On the 50th anniversary of their first official performance, 28 November, the company will, fittingly, be on the road, performing Cinderella in Norwich. \u201cThe human exchange is what\u2019s wonderful,\u201d says Nixon. \u201cYou\u2019re sitting with other humans and watching other humans and it\u2019s an energy that comes across between you.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
