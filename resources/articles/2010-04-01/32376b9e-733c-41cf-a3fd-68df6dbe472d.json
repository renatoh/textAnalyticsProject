Senior managers in NHS trusts typically earned \u00a3147,500, according to a new report on boardroom pay. The pay increase comes on top of a rise of 6.4% in 2007-08. The pay hike was greater for chief executives at NHS trusts awarded the so-called \"marker of excellence\" foundation status: chief executives at these trusts, which have greater financial freedoms on pay, received \u00a310,000 more a year on average than those managing trusts without the \"gold standard\" stamp. Experts have criticised the enhanced pay rise, pointing to recent Care Quality Commission data revealing that 12 of the 22 NHS trusts flagged up over concern about standards of cares are foundation trusts. The report, from Incomes Data Services (IDS), was based on data from around 90% of all NHS Trusts and Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) in England. Between 2008 and 2009, the researchers found, senior managers in NHS trusts received a 2.2% rise in a national pay agreement. Nurses got 2.75% in the same period and an extra 2.5% in April this year. Mike Jackson, Unison senior national officer, said local NHS bodies must offer salaries attractive to managers capable of running hospitals with turnovers that, in some cases, exceed \u00a3900m, but added: \"It is not right for senior staff to get above inflation pay hikes, while the rest of the workforce get a below inflation pay deal. \"This survey shows that foundation trust hospitals are using their autonomy to boost boardroom pay. This comes at the same time as many foundation trusts are found to be failing patients, not delivering better standards of care.\" The highest-paid chief executive was at Guy's and St Thomas' in London, with mid-point total earnings of \u00a3270,000. At Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust, the chief executive received \u00a3237,500 while at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, the chief executive was paid \u00a3217,500. A Department of Health spokeswoman said: \"NHS and foundation trusts are independent organisations and set their senior pay in the light of the recommendations of their independent remuneration committees. There are no central targets but all pay arrangements over \u00a3150,000 a year must now be publicly justified.\" Steve Tatton, editor of the IDS NHS Boardroom Pay Report 2010, said: \"The equation has fallen on the side of high salary awards with pay continuing to run ahead of the rest of the workforce.\" But a spokesman for Guy's and St Thomas' said: \"The pay of our chief executive, Ron Kerr, reflects the experience, expertise and responsibility that the role demands. Guy's and St Thomas' is one of the largest, most complex and successful NHS foundation trusts in the country.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
