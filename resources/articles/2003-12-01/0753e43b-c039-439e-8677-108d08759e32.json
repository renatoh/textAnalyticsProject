But it needn't be like that. There are several grief-free ways to put up the tree. The most obvious is to get an artificial one with its own stand, but you can also get metal stands for real trees at DIY superstores. Good ones have adjustable screws for fine-tuning the position of the tree, though heavy trees tend to sink into the screws regardless, so you end up propping something under one leg. The bucket-of-heavy-rocks method was used throughout my childhood with a moderate-to-high success rate. Wedge large pieces of flint (or bricks, as available) into a bucket, jostling them into position around the stem of the tree until it seems straight. Then tie into position. Erecting a tree is usually a two-person job , which is why it is so often a source of conflict - not because of the impossibility of goodwill between all men (and women), but because of the uneven distribution of labour within the task. Art directors of the operation need to stand well back to appreciate the aesthetics of the situation, whereas those holding the tree are manoeuvring a heavy object while up to the eyeballs and armpits in prickles. Swap roles. See how you like it. Happy Christmas ."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
