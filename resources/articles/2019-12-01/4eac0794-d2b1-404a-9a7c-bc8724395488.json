To say those feet are firmly planted on the ground might be understating the matter, for McNeil\u2019s is a football success story based on family values and recurring routines. As a child he would watch his father playing for clubs at non-league and lower league level around the north-west. \u201cStalybridge Celtic spotted him first, and he went to Hyde, Runcorn, Macclesfield and Stockport, with me and my mum following him everywhere every week,\u201d McNeil explains. \u201cFrom a very young age all I wanted to do was watch football, particularly when my dad was playing. According to my mum there was an old couple at Runcorn who couldn\u2019t believe how quiet and well-behaved I was at the age of about three. \u2018He loves football,\u2019 she told them. \u2018He follows the game.\u2019\u201d McNeil still lives with his parents, Matty and Tracy, in a house that bears testimony to two football careers, not one. \u201cGoing up our stairs, you pass my debut shirt on the wall, then my England Under\u201121s debut shirt, then Dad\u2019s from playing for Macclesfield against Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s Chelsea, then finally his Stockport one from the promotion play-off at Wembley, with his winner\u2019s medal next to it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice reminder all the time; you go past my stuff then his is there.\u201d Naturally McNeil Sr, a striker rather than a winger, did everything he could to help his son realise his ambition to also become a footballer. \u201cHe would have supported me with whatever I chose to do, but with me it was only ever going to be football,\u201d McNeil says. \u201cI still don\u2019t have a clue what I might be doing if I hadn\u2019t been any good, but once that decision was made Dad gave me tons of help. \u201cWhere we used to live there was a park with a massive cage. We would be there all the time doing sessions and drills. Lots of technical stuff, loads of cones and little goals. We would work on getting my touches going; dribbling has always been one of my strengths but I still work on improving it. \u201cDad advised me to watch the players who could go past people, and told me that if I got the first touch right I could glide past defenders too. It\u2019s a really key quality to have on the pitch, especially in tight situations, but for me it all goes back to all those drills in the cage in the park.\u201d The player the young McNeil modelled himself on most was Ryan Giggs. \u201cI used to watch everything he did,\u201d he says. \u201cDirect dribbles past people, crosses, goals, leadership, I just lapped it up. I was a United fan anyway, and so was my brother Bailey, but whereas he used to change the name on the back of his shirt quite often, every time United bought someone exciting or new, I just stuck with Giggs all the way through.\u201d Despite spending nine years in United\u2019s youth ranks McNeil never got to meet his hero, the policy of the club being to keep development players strictly separate from senior performers. Rather ludicrously, McNeil was picked up by United at the age of five, spotted while playing at a JJB Sports soccer school near the Trafford Centre for which his parents used to pay \u00a310 for two hours of football activity. \u201cBolton approached us first, but my mum and dad told them I was too young,\u201d he explains. \u201cThen when United showed interest and said they could see I had some technical ability, they were willing to go along with it. I was at United until I was 14, then I was released. The club didn\u2019t say anything to me, they just contacted my parents. Obviously I was disappointed and a bit hurt, because I had been chasing a dream and I wanted to prove I could be better than my dad, but Burnley stepped in to offer me a six-week trial and I\u2019ve never looked back since. \u201cThere are other players here who have been through the same thing, and now I\u2019m older I can see it sometimes works out for the best. Everyone has setbacks in life and even at a young age you have to deal with them. Personally I became more demanding of myself from age 14 onwards, more driven to succeed, so I suppose it was character-building in a way.\u201d If the football rumour mill is to be believed McNeil could be back at United in the not too distant future. Burnley\u2019s manager, Sean Dyche, has accepted he has a talent on his hands who may soon outgrow homely Turf Moor, though for now McNeil is perfectly happy. \u201cEveryone is down to earth here, everyone gets treated the same and we\u2019ve got a really good team spirit,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m the youngest in the squad by about four or five years but everyone gets on, it is a really good group. I feel like part of the family.\u201d McNeil\u2019s actual family must be delighted. \u201cOf course,\u201d he says. \u201cMy dad comes to every game, no matter where it is. It\u2019s funny but my mum didn\u2019t really like football at first, when she met my dad. Now she\u2019s just used to it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
