It's not simply their identity that the pair cloak so teasingly: the music they make is like a series of palimpsests, all woozy basslines, stuttering tempos and glacial washes of synths that feel like a hollowing out of several narrative strands in pop history. And while, for some, two spoken-word tracks \u2013 Untitled and Untitled (And Your Batty's So Round) \u2013 may bring to mind nothing so much as Baz Luhrmann's Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen), others may find it all strangely addictive."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
