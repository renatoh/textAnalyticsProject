A tiny school from the Philadelphia suburbs defeats the overwhelmingly favored defending champions led by future Hall of Fame center Patrick Ewing, derailing a dynasty apparent at the final hurdle. The tale has come to embody the giant-killing mythos of the NCAA tournament more than any other. On the surface Villanova\u2019s second national title, clinched Monday night in a white-knuckle thriller featuring nine ties and nine lead changes rightly hailed as the greatest title game ever played, bears little resemblance to the 1985 team\u2019s fairytale run. Those Wildcats finished the season with a 19-10 record and were fortunate to even make the tournament as a No8 seed \u2013 still the lowest ever to win the title \u2013 while this year\u2019s team were a No2 that spent nearly a month atop the national rankings. But don\u2019t be fooled. Given what it takes to succeed in the high-stakes climate of big-time college athletics today, Villanova\u2019s latest national championship is at least as improbable as their first. Yes, this year\u2019s Wildcats proved they were the best on merit. Unlike so many highly touted Jay Wright teams who crashed out of the field prematurely, these Wildcats peaked at the right moment: they shot 58.2% from the floor during the tournament \u2013 62.8% from two, an even 50% from three \u2013 and 81.4% from the free-throw line while outscoring their six opponents by more than 20 points per game. They closed the show by knocking off three teams that held the No1 ranking at some point this year and two more that spent time in the top 10. But consider that no university smaller than Villanova (undergraduate enrollment: 6,390) has won a national championship since the 1950s. Or that it still plays most home games in a modest 31-year-old, 6,500-seat on-campus field house affectionately known as the Ski Lodge. Or that its roster is drawn heavily from northeastern prep schools and includes zero projected NBA draft picks. Or that it\u2019s just become the first Catholic school to win the tournament since, well, Villanova. Without the benefit of a major football program, Villanova\u2019s athletic budget ($37.5m in 2014) pales in comparison to the big state schools that have all but made the national championship their collective birthright. Consider the revenues of the schools the Wildcats knocked off in the business end of this year\u2019s tournament \u2013 Iowa ($107.4m), Miami ($77.7m), Oklahoma ($135.7m), Kansas ($103.3m) and North Carolina ($85.3m) \u2013 for a sense of the institutional disadvantage a non-football school faces in the high-stakes arms race of big-time college sports. The lackluster record of Villanova\u2019s first champions was due in part to their membership in college basketball\u2019s most vaunted conference \u2013 the Big East \u2013 a superpower which accounted for three of that year\u2019s Final Four. It was a gauntlet that had nearly broken them by February but had them battle-hardened for the challenges ahead. This year\u2019s team played in a mere silhouette of the same league badly atrophied by a realignment that saw it picked apart by more powerful conferences: Notre Dame, Louisville, Pittsburgh and Syracuse to the ACC, West Virginia to the Big 12, Rutgers to the Big Ten, Connecticut to the American. The 1985 team\u2019s ultimate triumph would have likely been impossible under today\u2019s rules. Villanova-Georgetown was the last college basketball game ever played without a shot clock, a wrinkle Rollie Massimino used to masterful effect. They stalled at length to keep the ball out of Georgetown\u2019s hands and attempted only 10 shots after halftime, incredibly making all but one. This year\u2019s Wildcats won under rules that benefitted the fast-breaking Tar Heels, who were undone by the Wildcats\u2019 varied blend of isolations, post-ups and lights-out shooting. What Villanova accomplished in 1985, the first year of the NCAA\u2019s now familiar 64-team bracket, is a tall tale that will only grow more improbable with time \u2013 a sort of latter-day origin story that tickled the imagination by plumbing the extreme of what March Madness can be. Yet just because this year\u2019s Wildcats look the part doesn\u2019t make what happened Monday any less preposterous. The way college sports is built in 2016, Villanova is a bigger underdog than ever."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
