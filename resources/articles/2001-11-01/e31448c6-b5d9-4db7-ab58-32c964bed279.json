Trouble? Nah. Jubilation? Yep. A gang of 12 boys and one girl, waving green, white and gold tricolours, wrapped in scarves of the same hue and sporting daft hats, danced and hugged and sang. \"Keano, there's only two Keanos,\" they boasted, under the rain and through the mist, in deference to Roy and Robbie, patron saints of the Republic of Ireland's qualification for the 2002 World Cup finals. \"It's just like Euro 88, Italia 90 and USA 94 all over again, isn't it?\" the thirtysomething suggested nostalgically as an emotional tear trickled down a wrinkly emotional cheek. \"Sorry?\" they asked. \"Italia 90?\" \"Remember? Our first World Cup? Jack Charlton, Kevin Sheedy's equaliser against England, David O'Leary's penalty against Romania, remember?\" They studied each other's faces, concurred and asked: \"Who's Kevin Sheedy - and was David O'Leary a footballer?\" To these youngsters, with posters of Kevin Kilbane and Steve Finnan Bluetacked to their walls, the old names mean nothing. For them Irish footballing history dates back to that night in Tehran, Thursday, November 15, in the year of our Lord 2001, when Mick McCarthy led his men to the World Cup finals. Anything before that belongs in the National Museum of Distant Footballing Memories. This is, after all, the post-Ole-Ole-Ole generation, the mites tempted by the distractions of Gaelic football, hurling and, damn it, rugby. Now? Football's king again. For young and old, it's: \"Here we go, here we go, here we go\" - again."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
