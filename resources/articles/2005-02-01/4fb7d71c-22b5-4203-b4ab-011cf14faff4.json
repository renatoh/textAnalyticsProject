The National Institute for Medical Research is to move to UCL. The battle for the lucrative contract saw King's announce a new \u00a34.5m research strategy last week to attract 63 new academics in a bid to boost its research profile. The new posts were largely in bioinformatics and chemical biology, which raised speculation that the university was vying for the contract. But the decision to award it to UCL, taken today by the Medical Research Council, which currently runs the centre, was unanimous. A statement announcing the decision highlighted the similarities in the research carried out by the institute and UCL. The president and provost of UCL, Malcolm Grant, told EducationGuardian.co.uk that the move would make the university a prominent player in global biomedical research. \"I think it would make us unrivalled in Europe. There is serious competition in the US, but we would be able to stand up to that challenge. \"The benefit of it coming to us is the close relationship of the science they and we are doing. We share key strengths in key areas. By bringing together complementary teams and cross fertilising those teams and having joint PhD programmes we enhance our critical mass and become a significant player in the world.\" Prof Grant said it was impossible to calculate how much the contract would be worth because UCL would have to invest in the project. The MRC is, however, funding the move to UCL's Bloomsbury headquarters. The chief executive of the MRC, Colin Blakemore, has come under sustained criticisms from academics and MPs for his handling of the move. On Tuesday, the House of Commons science and technology committee published a report based on an inquiry it held, which criticised Prof Blakemore for being \"heavy-handed\" with the institute's scientists over the move. However, it cleared him of \"coercing\" them into it. Prof Blakemore said today: \"The MRC is very pleased with this outcome. We are confident that partnership with UCL offers a very exciting future for the renewed institute, which will enable it to make an even fuller contribution to translational research in the coming decades. We are looking forward to working with UCL and NIMR staff to develop the full science and business case for relocation.\" Prof Grant said UCL would work with NIMR staff to \"prepare a truly outstanding scientific vision for the future\". He added: \"It has been difficult over the past year, but if we can achieve a greater consensus about how to improve it I think it will be a success. \"I would hope now that the scientific community will see the logic of this choice and that we settle down and truly make it work.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
