Ingres to Matisse: Masterpieces of French Painting sounds magisterial, but isn't. At least the show's original title, The Triumph of French Painting, has been quietly sidelined. It's as if the RA had been told they were booking in a blockbuster only to find, to their horror, a mere 50-odd, conservatively selected French paintings when they opened the packing crates. The paintings are from two art galleries in Baltimore, collected in the 19th and early 20th century by the wealthy of the city. Despite catalogue essays that try to establish a special relationship between Baltimore and France, a detour via Maryland does not automatically enhance our appreciation of French art. We do owe the world's great collections of modern art to rich businessmen and their rebellious heirs; take the Davies sisters, who gathered an audacious choice of French art now in the National Museum and Gallery of Wales, or the Bostonians who bequeathed incomparable Monets to their city's Museum of Fine Arts. But their Baltimore contemporaries bought what they thought they should. Seen through their eyes everything looks tepid. We get one Manet, The Cafe-Concert - admittedly a wonderful scene in which a mustachioed old goat stands at the bar next to a young woman smoking despairingly. But we are supposed to be grateful for three paintings by the conservative academic painter Jean-L\u00e8on G\u00e8r\u00f4me. His Roman Slave Market is a jaw-dropping piece of sexual hypocrisy, the setting an excuse to depict a nude woman in a titillating way; when Henry Walters bought it in 1917 I'm sure it was with the highest ideals. How many masterpieces are there in this show? Ten perhaps, including a Courbet landscape with which you could become obsessed. Matisse is represented by intoxicating works. But an exhibition is more than a jewel collection. It should have some insight. This is a tour bus visit to France - there's Ingres, there's Delacroix, tick them off and move on. It's not just the collectors but the curators who are at fault. I bet they loved hanging those G\u00e8r\u00f4mes and the other conservative works to show us, in line with the latest half-baked orthodoxy, that French art in the 19th century was of its time and not the explosive keg of innovation we like to imagine. But this is a case where the myth is true. You can look at G\u00e8r\u00f4me if you want, but Britain had its G\u00e8r\u00f4mes too, or its Burne-Joneses. We never had a Manet or a C\u00e8zanne. This tokenistic show adds little to our understanding of their achievement. Until September 23. Details: 020-7300 8000.
