But there is a darkly sobre note in this euphoric moment of inclusiveness and joy. Across the country, even as voters swept the first African-American into office, ballot initiatives were passed that stripped or restricted the rights of other Americans of their rights. Just as in 2004, when all 11 ballot measures banning gay marriage or its proxies were \"successful\", as of this writing it appears that every punishing measure aimed at the gay and lesbian community passed. Nationally, we didn't hear as much about them this time around. Democrats didn't campaign on these issues, and the election certainly didn't hinge on them, but their impact will not be dampened despite our collective silence. What happened? Well the hard breakdown went like this: Arizona passed a ban on gay marriage that mandated \"only a union between one man and one woman would be recognised\". It was effectively the same measure that failed two years ago, when John McCain, who at that time spoke his mind rather than channelling the visions of the religious right, came out against it. Arkansas passed a measure banning gay couples from adopting children. Florida passed a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage and any union that approximates marriage. In California, proposition 8, the ballot measure that literally \"eliminates the right\" of gay men and lesbians to marry, has been passed. (For good measure, I'd rope into this group Nebraska's decision to \"end\" affirmative action, though that's an issue that extends to women and minorities. Colorado has a similar initiative with an uncertain future.) These anti-gay measures, which effectively institutionalise a second class citizenship for gay men and lesbians in these states. It also strips thousands of Californian couples of a right they enjoyed for only a few precious months. Proposition 8 tears the fabric of our democracy even as we seek to repair it through this historic election. In California the situation is especially grim. Over $25m in aggressive advertising used children in an effort to stir up base anxieties. One spot insisted that children would be taught about gay marriage and taken to lesbian weddings as part of their education. \"Protect Marriage, Protect Children,\" said another advertisement. A coalition of strange bedfellows emerged \u2013 Evangelicals, Mormons, and, if the exit polls are correct, a large number of African-Americans and Latinos who likely split their votes casting ballots for Barack Obama and against their fellow Californians. In some respects this speaks to the broad appeal of President-elect Obama. His supporters are hardly the rabid liberals the McCain-Palin ticket conjured. Younger voters generally voted against these measures. Anti-gay amendments are largely, and primarily supported by older voters across the country. But the activists pushing them state by state and county by county are racing to institutionalise discrimination before the ranks of younger voters swell to eclipse their parents and grandparents. But woe to those who think these measures won't impact them: this negativity and hate will not be restricted. Both Florida and Arkansas's measures are so broadly worded, and so far reaching, that they will in fact restrict and undermine the rights of all unmarried couples. Florida may be vague, but Arkansas explicitly forbids all \"unmarried\" couples from adopting or fostering children, which seems to \u2013 inherently and explicitly \u2013 undermine the rights of children in need. The only bright spots in these legislative and constitutional disasters were Colorado's decision not to extend \"personhood\" status to the foetus (which would have given rights equal to or greater than the mother to the unborn child) and South Dakota's umpteenth effort to end abortion rights. How unfortunate. This is such a proud moment for America as a country, but such a base time for these states."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
