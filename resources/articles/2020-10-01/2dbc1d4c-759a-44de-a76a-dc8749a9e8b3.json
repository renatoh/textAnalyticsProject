We only lost in the penalties, it would have been a draw in a league game and against Arsenal that is a good result. Particularly as we had the better chances in the game. We probably did enough to deserve to win, but we didn\u2019t, and you have to accept that. I was pleased with the quality we showed but tonight it just didn\u2019t work out. I can\u2019t be completely happy because we lost, but I liked a lot of parts to our game.\u201d Klopp seemed to hint that Xherdan Shaqiri could be on his way out of Anfield after the Switzerland international was left out of the squad. \u201cIt\u2019s the time of the year where some things happen in the background and we have to react sometimes and that\u2019s what we did,\u201d Klopp said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
