Not only did the Canadian-born left-hander have to demonstrate the determination of a bulldog to defeat the world No66 Vladimir Voltchkov, he also displayed that very British trait of putting his supporters through the mangle before recording a 4-6, 7-6, 7-6 victory. Confirmation of what had long appeared apparent - that the British No2's interest in the tournament was patchy - came when his error-strewn third game of the final set saw him broken to love; likewise when the right-hander from Belarus served for the match at 5-2. At which point Rusedski recovered to win four of the next five games and then canter into a 6-0 tie-break lead before giving his followers a final cause for conniptions by squandering four successive match points. The revival coincided with an improvement in Rusedski's serve, which had hitherto been uncharacteristically docile, a problem he attributed to a gusting cross-court wind. \"He played better tennis than me for the first set and also handled the wind better,\" Rusedski said. \"The wind affected my serve until I started tossing the ball up higher. But at least I found a way to dig out a win when I wasn't playing well and that's a good sign.\" A favourable omen for Wimbledon would be for Rusedski to arrive there having won this event for the second time. \"My preparations for Wimbledon are complete,\" he added. \"I feel fit and could have played another two sets today. Nevertheless I'd like to continue the momentum tomorrow. \"It will be a big positive if I can make it into the final and win it - people take notice if you go into a tournament on the back of winning one.\" He enjoyed his most successful Wimbledon in 1997 when he reached the quarter-finals after winning at Nottingham. First, though, he must account for the world No99 Hicham Arazi of Morocco, who defeated Australia's Wayne Arthurs 6-4, 6-3. The winner of that encounter will meet either the defending champion Jonas Bjorkman, who benefited from a walkover because Taylor Dent was injured, or Mardy Fish, the conqueror of Alex Popp 4-6, 7-6, 6-4."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
