After all, three of Chechnya's four previous presidents have died violently, including the last one ... And Mr Alkhanov's own selection, like that of Akhmad Kadyrov before him, came through an election blatantly rigged by the Russian government ... \"Mr Alkhanov ... is promising Chechnya's long-suffering population an economic revival, but the more likely prospect is the grinding continuation of a war that has destroyed the republic, bled and corrupted the occupying Russian army, and contributed to the crumbling of democracy and free speech in Russia itself. Responsibility for this debacle lies squarely with Vladimir Putin, the Russian president.\" Olga Romanova Vedomosti, Russia, August 31 \"Once again presidential elections in Chechnya have passed off successfully. These days a great success in Russia is when an event that is presented as historically important does not actually interest anyone at all - because [it] takes place under strictly controlled conditions and everyone knows what will happen beforehand. Moreover, all elections in Russia are becoming more and more like those of Mr Putin. You take an unknown modest civil servant, stick him on a stool and say to the people: 'Vote for him'. And the people acquiesce. \"Nothing is easy in Chechnya, where someone is blown up on a regular basis, but the situation seems quieter ... because it has become unacceptable to talk about it on state television ... We are promised that this time round everything really will be OK. It would be interesting to know, however, why everything will be OK.\" Moscow Times Editorial, August 31 \"The big question ... is whether Mr Alkhanov will be able to run the war-ravaged region at least as well as his predecessor ... Mr Alkhanov obviously lacks Mr Kadyrov's charisma and influence ... [and] has no real power base of his own. He also has little influence over Chechen rebel leaders, and therefore stands little chance of convincing them to surrender their weapons. \"The next few months will determine whether Mr Alkhanov can parlay his presidential post into real political power in Chechnya. To do so, he will have to marginalise powerful patrons and convince the federal government to keep subsidies flowing while expanding the share of revenue from Chechen oil sales that enters the regional budget. He will also have to crack down on alleged widespread abuses committed against civilians by government forces. If Mr Alkhanov fails, the situation in Chechnya may deteriorate to the point that the Kremlin's spin doctors can no longer conjure an image of stability - even on state television.\" Akhmed Zakayev Kommersant, Russia, August 31 \"[Mr Alkhanov] was not elected but appointed by Mr Putin the day after Mr Kadyrov's death. Neither Allah or the people have participated in this farce [the election]. \"Mr Alkhanov won't have his own policies. He will unconditionally do the Kremlin's bidding. Seventy five percent (his voter support) is a meaningless figure; it's not important how people voted but how the votes were counted.\" Akhmed Zakayev is a special representative of the Chechen rebel leader Aslan Maskhadov Andrew Kuchins Nezavisimaya Gazeta, Russia, August 30 \"The result of the presidential elections in Chechnya is clear. You knew exactly who was going to win before they even took place. [But] we should remember that a tragedy involving two airliners took place before the election. If the Chechen link to this act of terror holds up, then the west will be more sympathetic and supportive of the Russian leadership when it comes to the Chechen problem.\" Komsomolskaya Pravda Editorial, Russia, August 31 \"The results of the presidential elections in Chechnya show that a significant step has been taken so that the words 'Chechen' and 'terrorist' stop being synonymous.\" Independent Editorial, August 31 \"Nothing sums up Russia's failure in the troubled southern region of Chechnya more pointedly than the coincidence of two developments ... The first was the announcement that Mr Putin's choice ... had been elected Chechnya's new president by a landslide. The second was confirmation from Russia's security services that simultaneous plane crashes five days before the election were caused by explosives - most likely detonated by Chechen women suicide bombers. Neither announcement bodes well for the future of Chechnya, nor yet for its relations with Russia ... \"Mr Putin, no less than a British or US leader, has his political constituency to consider. Before too long, however, with a new, loyal, president installed in Chechnya, Mr Putin should take the risk. It would be in the interests of war-weary Chechens, in the interest of Russians and in the interest of Mr Putin himself to invite all parties to renounce violence and sit around a table to talk. If there is to be any end to the conflict, this is the only way it will happen.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
