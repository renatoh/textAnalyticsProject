In France this week, 17 people died in and after an attack by Islamist terrorists on the office of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. Three gunmen also died. Marc Cooper, a journalism professor at University of Southern California at Annenberg, had called not running the pictures \u201cabsolute cowardice\u201d. \u201cDear Marc, appreciate the self righteous second guessing without even considering there might be another point of view,\u201d Baquet said in a comment on Cooper\u2019s Facebook page. \u201cHope your students are more open minded. Asshole.\u201d \u201cOf course there is a second view,\u201d Baquet said in another comment. \u201cAnd I welcome it. But your note was thoughtless and arrogant. It didn\u2019t invite argument. It invites so what you got [sic].\u201d \u201cI welcome vigorous debate,\u201d he said, \u201cnot righteous cheap shots.\u201d \u201cUnderstand you disagree,\u201d he added. \u201cBut there was a thoughtful discussion to be had. Next time I promise we will have it. But I bristle at arguments like those of [commenter Bernard] Fauchier who think it was a question of courage. It was not.\u201d \u201cThanks for the chance to exorcise my demons now. Dean.\u201d Cooper told the Guardian he did not know how he became Facebook friends with Baquet, and that the comment came as a surprise. \u201cI thought it was really silly,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cHe has more important things to do [than] to be so thin-skinned, and to be so nasty, and so sensitive with somebody that he doesn\u2019t really know.\u201d \u201cIf he wants to debate it with me,\u201d Cooper added, \u201che\u2019d be welcome.\u201d The New York Times later issued its own comment. \u201cDean responded passionately to an arrogant comment that seemed intended to provoke,\u201d said a representative. \u201cIn the end, these are very difficult decisions and Dean made this one with great care, understanding that there would be people who disagreed \u2013 many of them reasonable and civil, some less so.\u201d The article Cooper\u2019s post originally linked to was one in which the Times\u2019 public editor, Margaret Sullivan, described the process by which Baquet reached his decision, which she wrote involved \u201cseeking out the views of senior editors and reaching out to reporters and editors in some of the Times\u2019 international bureaus\u201d. Baquet\u2019s position on whether to publish the cartoons is one that the Guardian shares."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
