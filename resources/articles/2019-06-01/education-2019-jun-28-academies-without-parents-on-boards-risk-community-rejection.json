The report by the National Governors Association (NGA) warns that the lack of parent representation on the boards of schools run by multi-academy trusts (Mats) has created a \u201cdemocratic deficit\u201d, made worse by the trusts attempting to improve their financial position by taking over more schools. \u201cThe evolution and promotion of Mats without sufficient thought to governance has produced a [democratic] deficit that requires debate, one that must not be ignored any longer,\u201d the report states. The government recently announced that more than half of England\u2019s state school pupils were being taught in academies, following the explosion in numbers after policy changes by the coalition government in power from 2010-2015. But Sam Henson, NGA\u2019s director of policy and one of the report\u2019s authors, said there was still scepticism towards academies, driven by media reports of high-profile cases of mismanagement, such as the Wakefield City academies trust collapse last year and the \u201czombie schools\u201d given up by the Mats that previously managed them. Henson said trusts needed to be more transparent to avoid their negative image. Some were already willing to include representatives of parents on governing boards. \u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about trusts with 30 or 40 schools, and a trust being run by just three or four people in its top tier of management, then that is concentrating a lot of power and responsibility in a small group of people,\u201d Henson said. \u201cThere\u2019s also a danger that trusts will have difficulty in gaining the confidence of a school\u2019s community because some of them are so geographically dispersed.\u201d The report comes as a number of parent-led groups battle efforts to convert local primary schools into academies. In one high-profile case, a Mat has halted a planned takeover, at Waltham Holy Cross primary school in Essex, following a campaign by parents. The report noted \u201cnumerous examples of Mats taking on schools with serious issues or without considering properly their capacity for school improvement or the financial impact\u201d. The report said: \u201cNGA is aware of some Mats that are particularly struggling with financial risk, and several Mats have outlined that they were eager to achieve economies of scale and arguably rushed into making serious financial commitments without considering the impact on the existing pupils.. \u201cNGA\u2019s evidence demonstrates that some trusts simply grow in order to shore up their finances \u2026 however expansion does not guarantee improvements, or even guarantee a more financially sustainable future.\u201d Theo Agnew, the schools minister in theLords, said the NGA\u2019s report showed that good governance was crucial to improving school standards. \u201cStrong governance should be at the heart of every multi-academy trust. This ensures leaders are supported and effectively challenged. The rising academic standards that many multi-academy trusts are helping to deliver is testament to the good governance already in place,\u201d Lord Agnew said. While the NGA\u2019s report was careful to say that many Mats were well run, it noted cases of failures by Mats executives and trustees to register conflicts of interest, as well as repeated failures to rein in rising executive pay. \u201cIn isolated cases NGA is aware of trusts that have allowed their chief executive to present the board with proposals for their own pay for the trustees to then decide,\u201d the report read. It concluded: \u201cThe government should develop and maintain a stronger line on executive pay levels.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 28 June 2019 because an earlier version was edited to suggest that parent-led groups were trying to convert primary schools into academies. This has been corrected to say that the groups battle efforts to convert the schools."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
