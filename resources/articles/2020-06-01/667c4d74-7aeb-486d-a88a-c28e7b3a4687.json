It was assembled from more than 2,000 hours of backstage footage from her 2016 election drive, interviews with 45 of the people who know her best (from childhood friends to her campaign aides, alongside her daughter Chelsea and \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you remember this guy but \u2013 her husband Bill) and 35 hours of face-to-face interviews with the woman herself. It interweaves the story of the fateful election with her personal history, recapping her upbringing as the child of staunch Republican Methodist parents, her academic brilliance, the influence of second wave feminism, her professional success as a lawyer and her marriage. There is, of course, much on her political career and the media narratives that have been endlessly constructed and deconstructed around her, as the peaks (such as beating Bernie Sanders in Iowa) and troughs (oh dear God, the troughs) of the campaign trail are navigated. Everything you would expect to be here is here. The problem is that this four-hour portrait has the full involvement of its subject and sanctioned cooperation of everyone around her. We have the friends who attest to her early interest in public service, the professor who talks of her pragmatic, problem-solving attitude and fierce intelligence. The Whitewater scandal is noted, but only Clinton\u2019s disbelief at the subsequent conspiracy theories are given any airtime. The Monica Lewinsky revelations are raked over \u2013 Bill teary-eyed with regret at \u201cthe things I did for years to manage my anxieties\u201d \u2013 as we see the former communications director marvelling at Hillary\u2019s courage during the fallout. It\u2019s not exactly a hagiography, but there is no grit in the oyster. The bookending of each episode with faux-informal chat between her and Burstein as Clinton has her face powdered and prepares for filming proper are cloying attempts at conveyingintimacy. Burstein has spoken about the refusal of any Republicans to take part in the film because, she says, they felt that Clinton\u2019s central involvement would result in their claws being pulled in the edit. Whatever the truth of that, the result is that the closest we get to criticism is a journalist describing her in relation to her refusal to release the transcripts of her speeches to Wall Street companies as \u201cextremely confident in her own righteousness \u2013 and that can trip anyone up\u201d. Clinton is rarely pressed on any personal or political issues and in a sense there would be no point in doing so. She has been doing this for too long and under far more extreme and challenging circumstances to give away any morsel of herself more than she chooses now. Weaselly reframings (\u201cI suffer from the responsibility gene\u201d, she says in explanation of her inability to deliver the kind of simple messages demanded by a presidential nominee or candidate. \u201cI don\u2019t like to say something I know isn\u2019t doable\u201d), passive-voiced glosses, and not-quite apologies are allowed to stand. A flash of anger about Sanders (\u201cHe just drove me crazy \u2026 no one wanted to work with him, he got nothing done, he was a career politician\u201d) only serves to throw the careful, controlled blandness of the rest into relief. Of the darker allegations about corruption and sexual scandal that have dogged the Clintons, almost nothing was said. Elsewhere, Burstein has stated that she took a conscious decision not to ask the Clintons about Juanita Broaddrick\u2019s claim that Bill raped her (which he denies), nor any of the other assault allegations, lest it \u201cbecome more about his story than hers\u201d. Hmm. Still, watching her lose to the bullyboy tactics of Trump remains an agony. Her interviews were filmed in November 2018 and you find yourself shaking your head and muttering \u201cYou don\u2019t know the half of it, lady\u201d in despair. As the final hour of the quartet marched on, it dawned on me that existence since 2016 has been like living in a counterfactual. Someone was writing a what-if novel or film or television series as the Brexit and US election votes came in and somehow there was a slip, a glitch in the matrix, and we have been living with the results ever since. Love Clinton or hate her, it could \u2013 and, according to the popular vote, should \u2013 have been so different."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
