Laura Evelyn, an actor looking for a new place to stay, didn\u2019t like the decor particularly \u2013 the fake leather sofa and glass dining table weren\u2019t to her taste \u2013 but her would-be landlord was friendly enough. But as she was leaving the viewing, the owner handed her a sheet of paper. When Evelyn read it, she was flabbergasted. It contained a list of 31 rules that Evelyn, aged 35, would be expected to abide by if she moved in. Showers couldn\u2019t last longer than 15 minutes. She was allowed two visitors a month, who must be approved two weeks in advance. After eating, she must wash up, and immediately return to her room. And if she left dishes in the sink, she\u2019d be charged \u00a315 a pop. Probably the most shocking thing about this story was that Evelyn still considered moving in. \u201cAs a renter who had no way of buying, the housing market had me by the balls,\u201d she says. Because her \u00a3450-a-month budget was low, Evelyn\u2019s options were limited. \u201cI read [the list] with a very open mind. It took a second reading for me to be like, what the hell?\u201d Most people are used to abiding by rules \u2013 and good manners \u2013 when cohabiting with others. Have sex quietly, don\u2019t hog the bathroom and never microwave mackerel, unless you are a monster. But, in effect, what Evelyn\u2019s would-be landlord wanted wasn\u2019t a flatmate; he just wanted her to pay his mortgage and disappear. This is an egregious example of the worst inequalities of the housing crisis, but also not as unusual as you may think. Browse Spareroom or Gumtree, and you will see similarly extreme housemate adverts. There was the \u00a3650-a-month London flatshare where tenants were forbidden from Skyping their family in the evening. There are the rogue landlords who offer to waive rent, in exchange for sex. Then there are the lighthearted ones. Are you a postgraduate student looking for a double room to let in Brixton? Come this way \u2013 provided you aren\u2019t an anthropologist. (Sociologists and social psychologists are welcome.) What these adverts reflect is that Britain is going back to being a nation of renters. Home ownership levels have plunged, with a quarter of UK households expected to rent privately by the end of 2021. In 2017, British tenants paid a record \u00a350bn in rent. Young adults form \u201cGeneration Rent\u201d, with homeownership a distant dream for those professionals on average incomes but without the large deposits needed to get on to the housing ladder. The night before I speak to a 28-year-old PR worker who lives in north-east London, she ate sweets for dinner in her bedroom. Why? Because she finds her live-in landlord\u2019s rules so restrictive that she avoids communal areas such as the kitchen. She is expected to abide by a checklist taped to the back of the front door, which insists that hair straighteners are turned off, and lists the various doors, windows and skylights that must be locked prior to leaving. In the bathroom, her other housemate stuck a note to the mirror, requiring all spittle to be wiped away immediately. \u201cThe level of micromanaging \u2026 it\u2019s madness,\u201d she says. Her landlord even installed a smart plug on her hair straighteners, which she remotely controls via her phone. She wants to leave, but moving house is expensive and her \u00a3600-a-month budget is low, meaning that she is stuck for now. Her mental health has deteriorated. \u201cYou\u2019re always stressed,\u201d she says. \u201cYou think: \u2018If I see her, is she going to complain about something?\u2019\u201d Expecting prospective tenants to live under a quasi-feudal regime reflects the power wielded by landlords in our property-centric society. \u201cThese restrictive ads amply underline the extent to which power, like wealth, is concentrated in the hands of landlords,\u201d says Portia Msimang of the pressure group Renters Rights London. \u201cSome people get overexcited by that power.\u201d Some of these restrictions may even be illegal, she points out. \u201cThe renter would have a very strong defence against any attempt at eviction on the basis of breach of unfair terms.\u201d But without root-and-branch reform of the UK\u2019s housing provision, such behaviour seems likely to continue. And it\u2019s not just landlords who have the power. Existing tenants of desirable houseshares can afford to be choosy about who they live with, screening candidates on everything from their dietary preferences to their political beliefs or their star signs. (Unlike gender or sexual orientation, these are not protected characteristics under the law, and so these stipulations aren\u2019t illegal.) Which is bad news for Capricorns. In April, a New York City housing advert went viral after a prospective applicant was rejected for belonging to that star sign. Megan, a 24-year-old from Brighton, thinks that the no-Capricorn advert is ridiculous because, in her experience, Capricorns make perfectly good housemates. It\u2019s Cancers you need to watch out for. \u201cI had a housemate who was a Cancer, and it wasn\u2019t good for either of us.\u201d A Gemini, Megan\u2019s preference would be to live with Leos, Taureans or Capricorns. She would ban Cancers from moving into her house should a room become available \u2013 and probably also Scorpios, if she\u2019s being honest. \u201cIt\u2019s like, how many more emotional Cancers or Scorpios will I live with, before I acknowledge it\u2019s not meant to be?\u201d There can be darker factors at work: a 2018 Guardian investigation found that people from ethnic minorities face discrimination when looking for houseshares. For every 10 positive replies to an inquiry about a room for rent sent by a prospective renter called \u201cDavid\u201d, inquiries from a \u201cMuhammad\u201d received only eight. Sometimes, racism is coded more overtly: the writer and director Yero Timi-Biu recently made headlines after she posted a text exchange with a landlord asking where her parents were from and it went viral. \u201cWhere demand for accommodation outstrips supply, landlords, agents and other renters can pick and choose,\u201d says Msimang. \u201cIf they\u2019re bigoted people, they pick and choose in line with their bigotry.\u201d But houseshare ads can exclude certain groups of people for more understandable reasons. Clare is 33 and advertising a spare bedroom in her house in east London. Prospective housemates must not eat meat in the house, as Clare and her flatmates are vegetarians or vegans. \u201cI find meat really unsettling,\u201d she says. \u201cWhere people see food, I see something dead.\u201d If someone moved in and then started eating meat, she\u2019d probably ask them to leave, she says. LGBT-only houseshare adverts are also common. For many queer people, they are necessary to create a home in which they feel safe. Jender Anomie, a 27-year-old artist from Bexhill in East Sussex, would prefer to live with fellow queer people. \u201cI\u2019m sure this is the same of many marginalised groups,\u201d Anomie says. \u201cLiving with heterosexual people can be really trying, and it seems unnecessary suffering if you have access to another, more welcoming type of living space.\u201d At their heart, many housemate adverts are about looking for like-minded people. But you can overegg it. In 2014, Henry Blanchard, a young entrepreneur, posted an advert looking for flatmates to \u201ccome and join us in \u2018Reinventing Living\u2019\u201d, and thereby inadvertently spoofed the toe-curling excesses of the Silicon Valley tech-bro culture. (\u201cDo you believe in passion, integrity, positivity and working smarter, not harder? \u2026 Picture the scene \u2013 waking up at 6 every morning for a group run or yoga with the house.\u201d) Looking back on the ad now, the 33-year-old cringes. \u201cI was in this startup bubble \u2026 I think the house ad was a reflection of that. I wanted to bring my work into every part of my life.\u201d Blanchard did manage to find \u201clike-minded creators\u201d willing to move into his #disruptive houseshare, but they never secured a suitable property. It\u2019s probably for the best. \u201cI had this idealised version of what I thought my life should look like.\u201d What would he think if he saw that advert now? Blanchard laughs. \u201cI would think: \u2018I hope it works out for you.\u2019\u201d The best houseshare adverts use humour to make serious points. Travis Nemmer\u2019s 2017 advert for a flatmate in Washington DC went viral after the 27-year-old attorney laid his political cards on the table. \u201cI am a Republican, who will occasionally say nice things about our president. If that\u2019s a dealbreaker, I assure you that you will have no trouble finding some kinda commune.\u201d Nemmer says he didn\u2019t want anyone to be \u201cblindsided\u201d by his political views, given that DC is a fiercely liberal city. The person who moved in was leftwing, so the advert worked. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say people didn\u2019t want to live with me because I\u2019m a conservative. I don\u2019t have any problems getting along with people regardless of politics. They probably don\u2019t want to live with me because I\u2019m messy.\u201d But if you are writing a humorous house-share ad, people can miss the joke, as 35-year-old Pete Williams, from Auckland, New Zealand, knows only too well. When he wrote an advert that forbade laughing after 11pm or excessive bowel movements, he thought everyone would get it. Sadly, that wasn\u2019t to be the case. \u201cIt actually led to quite a lot of nasty feedback.\u201d He insists 95% of the advert \u2013 which also proscribed eating baked beans, because \u201cI need someone a little more sophisticated in here\u201d \u2013 was a joke, and that he\u2019s actually an easy-going person. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d have had flatmates for two years continuously if I was as crazy as the ad makes me out to be,\u201d he says. Williams is, perhaps, also a victim of the housing crisis. He is disabled and struggles to find accessible rental properties \u2013 which meant that when he found the property, he agreed to be the lead tenant, responsible for its entire monthly rent. Luckily, he found someone to take the room; \u201cShe got the humour,\u201d he says. But he probably wouldn\u2019t go down the same route again. \u201cThis one didn\u2019t quite hit the nail on the head.\u201d At the housing crisis continues to escalate, more of us will be forced to live with strangers well into adulthood. \u201cI\u2019m too old to be flatsharing,\u201d says the PR worker. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to do it. I\u2019m tired of doing it.\u201d These adverts tell stories of exploitation and abuse: greedy landlords infringing their tenant\u2019s fundamental rights in ways that are possibly illegal. But it\u2019s not always bad. The authors are often just searching for common ground with the people who will share their homes \u2013 whether it\u2019s with a fellow astrology-lover, a vegan or someone who also gets what it\u2019s like to be marginalised. For Anomie, living in queer spaces gives her access to \u201cunconditional love and understanding\u201d. These adverts are about more than whether you are a Capricorn or vegan, a conservative or a growth hacker. They\u2019re about people, just trying to get along."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
