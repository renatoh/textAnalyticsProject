Galway Bay", "bodyText": "Why? Of all the places in Ireland I've been to, Galway Bay is the one that keeps calling me back. I love a particular thatched cottage just outside Spiddal, set back from the coast road. The best thing? The air because it's clean! This is air you can take in down to your boots. It reawakens the soul, and cures my asthma within hours of arriving. I even like the bad west coast weather; but if I'm going to be battered by a sea wind, let it be there. My ideal day: A leisurely morning on the patio watching swallows and crows; then a drive to Connemara National Park to spot finches and wagtails. Later, I'd head to Galway for a hearty meal at KC Blake's and a stroll around the harbour at dusk. My advice: Always carry a cagoule and a compact pair of binoculars. Getting there: Galway is about 60 miles from Shannon airport. Ryanair (0871 2460000, ryanair.co.uk) flies Stansted-Shannon for around \u00a385pp return including taxes. Where was your best holiday? San Francisco,for my honeymoon. What is the best hotel you have ever stayed in? The Miyako, San Francisco (miyakohotel.com). It's not cheap, but once you are there it is tempting never to leave the room. What do you never travel without? Books. \u00b7 Andrew Collins presents Teatime (weekdays 4-7pm, BBC 6 Music). His childhood memoir, Where Did It All Go Right? is published by Ebury at \u00a36.99. Interview by Tim Wapshott"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
