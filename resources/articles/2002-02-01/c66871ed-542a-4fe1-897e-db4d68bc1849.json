Carole Montillet became the first Frenchwoman ever to win the gold medal and dedicated her victory to the memory of her former team-mate R\u00e9gine Cavagnoud. The 28-year-old Montillet, mother figure for a team grieving the death of the super-G world champion last October, set aside the frustration of repeated weather delays to win her first race of the season from more fancied rivals. The American Picabo Street, the former world champion making her last Olympic appearance and possibly even racing for the last time, gave her all before a fired-up home crowd but was never a threat and finished only 16th. Britain's Chemmy Alcott came 32nd in a race where only 35 finished on the demanding Wildflower piste. She will compete again in the super-G and combined events. \"Now I've got my first Olympic race out of the way I feel more relaxed,\" the 19-year-old said. But Glynn Pedersen's Olympics are over for 2002 after his failure to qualify for the final of the K120 (large hill) men's ski jump. The 20-year-old, the first Briton to compete in the event since Eddie \"The Eagle\" Edwards in 1988, finished 48th out of the 52 competitors. Pedersen jumped only 91 metres, seven metres less than he had achieved in practice moments earlier. \"I could feel it wasn't right and it was well below my personal best on this hill,\" said the Canadian-born jumper who qualifies for Britain through a Scottish mother and English father. \"I still have much to learn.\" Enthusiasm raised by the victory of Britain's female curling team over Norway in their opening match proved to be short-lived when they lost their second rubber. Rhona Martin's rink beat the former European champions Norway 10-5 on Monday night but were quickly brought back to ice yesterday when Sweden beat them 7-4. It does not end their hopes of qualifying for the final four from the round- robin tournament, in which each of the 10 teams plays the rest. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
