And of the two visits, my most recent stay was, by some considerable distance, the most comfortable. My first, 11 months ago, was one of those rather risky, thoroughly unpleasant, utterly exhausting experiences that show-offy, thrill-seeking townies like me thrive on. And then bore their friends senseless by banging on about at any opportunity. I was taking part in Villars' annual 24-hour ski race (or, more officially \"Grand Prix 24h de Tremblant\"), which is the brainchild of grand prix driver Jacques Villeneuve, a Villars resident, and his motor-racing pal Craig Pollock to raise money for their F1 charity for sick kids. The rules of the race are simple; think Le Mans on skis and you won't be too wide of the mark. You get a team together (four or more) and do as many descents, relay-style, of the randomly floodlit courses (downhill and giant slalom) as you can in 24 hours. The team that achieves the most kilometres at the end is the winner. It's every man, Swiss banker, local hero, media type and disabled skier for himself, and apparently, it's a riot in good weather. Needless to say, when I did it the conditions were absolutely filthy. I will never forget that long night of shadows and fog - my whispered reveille at 4am as I lay cocooned by a prison-quality rug in a malodorous piste-side bunkhouse; the night air had a strange Milky Way quality, Ice Station Zebra cold, the grey sky leaking snowflakes the size of Shredded Wheats as I stumbled through the dark towards the start line for another bone-clattering session on the hill. Alone on the chairlift, I floated up into a pallid and swirly void. Then I jumped off the bench and poled like beejesus for the stupidly fast (and mostly totally dark) downhill section. Someone wiped out in front of me at speed. I skied right past him, only inches from his grimacing face. I did five laps of the course then collapsed into my bunk again. Did I mention I was doing this for fun? When we finished the race (95th out of 160), all I really wanted to do was find somewhere warm and cosy where I could lay down my heavy head and have a nice long sleep. Somewhere with a wood-burning stove, a soft bed and a nice warm duvet, just a short schuss away from the ski fields, so I wouldn't have to haul my body, boots and skis down the mountain. Well, it took almost a year, but 1,700m up, with a grandstand view of Les Diablerets mountain, far away from the lift queues, the rowdy apr\u00e8s-ski bars, the cars, the overcrowded hotels and the cluttered chalets, I finally found my perfect alpine refuge. Whitepod is where Bonington meets Bond. It is snowbound camping for the Wallpaper* magazine set. It is hi-tech, low-impact winter vacationing - a modernist, eco-centric, shagadelic chalet village. And right now, it is the very cutting-edge of mountain accommodation. This is how Whitepod works. Five, snow-white, geodesic domes are pitched on sturdy wooden decks around a restored 19th-century chalet. You can only get there on skis or snowshoes and your luggage is delivered via snowmobile. The pods, each around 8ft high, are made out of triple-insulated cotton stretched over a storm-proof steel frame. You enter them via a heavy duty-zipped portal to find a surprisingly spacious interior kitted out in a groovy combination of recycled, junk-shop chic and freshly self-assembled blond wood bits from Ikea. A wood-burning stove glows orange opposite the doorway. Cowskin rugs cover the wooden floors and there are sheepskins on the beds. Best of all, the 14-tog duvets are so toasty you won't want to get out of bed in the morning. Breakfast and dinner (don't miss the champagne fondue and the hearty pot \u00e0 feu) are eaten in the main chalet and you withdraw to a roaring fire and a glass of wine in a homely sitting room in the evenings for games and conversation. Then, with the stars (and a torch) as illumination, you make crunchy steps towards your pod, where your stove has been stoked and your bed warmed with a hot-water bottle in your absence. If you need entertainment, sounds are provided by a pre-loaded i-Pod music system. i-Pod. Whitepod. See what they did there? What is slightly ironic about this alpine leisure project, with its i-Pods and yuppie-ish, design-led image and fashion-conscious marketing, is that the basic geodesic pod was originally intended as a low-cost, emergency housing solution for poverty-stricken countries or disaster zones. Conceived by the American engineer Buckminster Fuller back in the 1950s, the geodesic dome is the lightest, strongest, and most cost-effective structure ever devised. Its genius lies in the fact that it is able to cover more space without internal supports than any other enclosure, and that it becomes proportionally lighter and stronger the larger it is. And get this, eco fans: ultimately, Buckminster Fuller wanted to construct a dome two miles in diameter that would enclose mid-town Manhattan in a temperature-controlled environment. The mammoth price of this project, he reckoned, would pay for itself within 10 years from the savings accrued from expensive urban snow-removal costs alone. Buckminster Fuller would no doubt approve of Whitepod's honourable efforts towards ecologically-sound holiday-making. Indeed, despite its Schrager-does-Millets appearance and highish-end price bracket, Whitepod is by no means a luxury destination and to enjoy your experience here, you need to be the type of person who likes to earn your little treats. In keeping with the set-up's environmentally aware philosophy, the generator that heats the water and makes the electricity runs for only a couple of hours, twice a day, so you get to shower for a few fleeting but blissfully hot minutes. Oh, and there aren't any loos (or running water) in the pods. This means either bracing dashes to the chalet for midnight pees or using the chamber pot under the bed. I chose to make yellow holes in the snow, just next to my pod instead. Human wee is biodegradable, isn't it? The payoff for all this minimally appointed, photogenically-designed inconvenience, however, is immense. You are gifted solitude, silence, grand cru air quality, gob-smacking views and a real sense of being in among nature. Whitepod is a super cool place not just because you can ski in and ski out, but because you can also ski before everyone else and carry on skiing after the last shuttle train has left for town in the afternoon. \"Skiing becomes a more fulfiling experience,\" says Whitepod proprietor Sofia Meyer, a Villars local. \"It becomes a means to explore mountains rather than just going up and down slopes.\" Unfortunately, it was too early in the season for skiing when I visited, so with a Whitepod guide to show me the way, I spent the day snowshoeing instead. I took giant, comedic, moonwalking steps down a knee-deep powder slope delighting at the dampened silence, the jagged mountain vista and stimulating lack of fellow humans. It was getting dark by the time we arrived back at the chalet for tea and tarts and I felt the smart, cold snap of the evening temperature drop as soon as I stopped. Tired but happy, I removed my yellow snow shoes by the chalet door and noticed a warm, wispy plume of smoke rising up from my white pod's copper chimney stack. I think I'll give the 24-hour ski race a miss this year.
