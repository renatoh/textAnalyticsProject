And yet it seems wrong that Alphabeat should be on a stage after children have gone to bed. It is only 8.15pm when the Danish sextet bounce onstage. But Stine Bramsen, Rasmus Nagel, Troels Hansen and three men all named Anders are shiny, happy creatures who do not belong to the night. They belong on Saturday morning TV, explaining how to care for a new gerbil. Co-singer Bramsen looks like a living doll, wearing an oversized red sweet wrapper for a dress. Her band's squeaky-clean, knock-kneed pop suggests Belle &amp; Sebastian playing the tunes of Roxette. Actually, the word 'sextet' seems a bit, well, strong for them. Let's call them a six-some. Oh wait. That could be even worse. Currently riding high on the back of two grimly effervescent hit singles, 'Fascination' and '10,000 Nights', they are more knowing than their rinky-dink melodies let on. 'Boyfriend' is both puddle-shallow ('don't you touch my boyfriend/ He's not your boyfriend/ He's mine') and impish. '10,000 Nights' throws out references to 'The Safety Dance' by Men Without Hats and even Kate Bush's 'Wuthering Heights'. Any grudging affection that may earn them, however, is snuffed out by Alphabeat's penchant for funk, a virginal variant that must be making James Brown shift in his grave. By contrast, innocence has been one of CSS's most appealing traits. Despite spouting lyrics about licking their 'art-tits' and sucking their 'art-holes', and their very name - Cansei de Ser Sexy, or tired of being sexy - CSS have always been fuelled by child-like glee. Clad tonight, as ever, in a lurid-hued leotard accessorised with a tinsel boa, singer Lovefoxxx is like an eight-year-old propelled by a surfeit of blue icing. When she falls over on 'Off The Hook', she turns it expertly into a tumble. Their stage is bedecked in helium balloons. Two dancers - friends in backwards donkey masks - throw some shapes at the rear. In guitar, keyboard and keytar player Ana Rezende, CSS have their very own cartoon Joey Ramone, reborn as a girl. They are in good form, slicker and more proficient than the haphazard party-on-a-stage of 2006. Band fulcrum Adriano Cintra has moved from the drum stool on to bass guitar; Jon Harper, once of the Cooper Temple Clause, now keeps time. As the masks attest, Donkey is the title of CSS's new album, a radical departure from their debut in both sound and themes. Disorientingly well-produced, the new songs sorely lack many of the eccentricities that made CSS special. When they recorded their eponymous debut, their English was charmingly ropey. Now fluent, in recent interviews the band have seemed embarrassed at their former crudity. Donkey sees them striving to be a proper pop outfit in word and sound; one mixed by Spike Stent, who used to do Madonna. Is it wrong to want to preserve a well-loved band in aspic? Perhaps. Is it patronising to want these S\u00e3o Paulistas to remain our pet foreigners? Well, yes. But it is a pity that the only real relic of their past daftness is 'Reggae All Night' - a likeable electro confection that gets the best response of all the new songs from the moshing crowd. Elsewhere, Donkey labours under a hundredweight of misery, but with good reason. While CSS toured the world incessantly for two years, their finances mysteriously sank into the red. CSS have since sacked their former manager, Eduardo. At least two songs on the new album, 'Left Behind' and 'Rat Is Dead' are poison darts directed his way. Ira Trevisan, CSS's former bass player, left recently - citing an interest in fashion and a concern for global warming - but she had also been in a relationship with Eduardo. It is a complex set of losses and loyalties betrayed that gave this happy-go-lucky party band a rude awakening. Yet they are still expert fun-makers. Tonight they mix favourites like 'Let's Make Love (and Listen To Death From Above)' and 'Alcohol' with new songs. Both perky and bittersweet, 'Left Behind' casts their partying in a darker light: as drinking to forget. But it's fine pop music. 'Rat Is Dead' is a guitar-heavy song about Ira breaking lots of glass while breaking up with Eduardo. Poppiest of all is 'Move', where synths plink like the Nineties never happened. Given time, these songs might seem as much a part of CSS as their irreverent celebrity-baiting tunes. Right now, their songs of innocence and experience dance awkwardly side by side."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
