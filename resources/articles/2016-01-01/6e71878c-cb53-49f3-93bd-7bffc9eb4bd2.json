The crisis facing world athletics has grown over the past two years to the level where many consider it to be worse than the turmoil enveloping Fifa that led to the downfall of Sepp Blatter, mass arrests by the US Department of Justice and a generation of executives being implicated in a $200m-plus bribery scandal. Dick Pound, the former president of World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada), is to present the second part of his report into systemic doping in Russia and attempted cover-ups at the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). He is among those who believe the scandal in athletics is worse because it \u201caffects the results on the field of play\u201d as opposed to \u201cmoving money around like the Fifa boys\u201d. In broadcast interviews before the publication of Pound\u2019s report, which is expected to be an indictment of the role of the IAAF in the scandal, Lord Coe \u2013 who was a vice-president for seven years under the previous regime \u2013 insisted there was \u201cno cover-up\u201d and he had not \u201cfor one moment\u201d regretted taking the role. \u201cOne of the accusations is that I don\u2019t get the seriousness of this issue. I do. I am dealing with it every day and have been dealing with this since effectively I took over as president,\u201d he told CNN. Last week, senior figures at the IAAF \u2013 including the son of Coe\u2019s predecessor and the head of the anti-doping unit \u2013 were banned, along with the head of the Russian athletics federation, following an ethics commission investigation that showed in shocking detail how they had attempted to subvert the testing system and extort money from the marathon runner Liliya Shobukhova. Since well before Coe took over in August, there has been a series of revelations linking the systemic doping in Russia, which saw the country banned from competition in the wake of Pound\u2019s first report, to cover-ups and corruption at the IAAF\u2019s headquarters in Monaco. The Guardian revealed this week that Papa Massata Diack, who acted as a marketing consultant for the IAAF, had apparently sent an email to International Olympic Committee members in 2008 arranging for \u201cparcels\u201d to be delivered to senior IOC members, while the French newspaper Le Monde claimed he had paid $50,000 in cash to Gabriel Dolle, the former head of the IAAF\u2019s anti-doping unit, to keep quiet about positive tests. A large leak of documents to the Associated Press this week showed senior IAAF officials knew as long ago as 2009 that the Russian blood doping was so serious that athletes risked dying and that Diack was warned in September 2012 that 42% of Russian elite athletes were doping. Before the press conference in Munich, Pound said: \u201cThe second report will consist of the possible criminal actions on the part of individuals, in response to the generalised claim that the IAAF did not follow up on positive test results.\u201d When the Sunday Times and German broadcaster ARD made those claims in the summer, Coe insisted they amounted to a \u201cwar on my sport\u201d. But he has faced a barrage of criticism over his handling of the crisis and questions about what he knew and when. The former London 2012 chairman and double Olympic gold medallist was also forced to give up his ambassadorial role at Nike after he admitted allegations of a conflict of interest had become an unwanted distraction. After Pound presents the second report, after the first in November blew the lid on systemic state-sponsored doping in Russia, the French financial prosecutor Eliane Houlette will take the unusual step of delivering an update on an ongoing criminal investigation. Also in November, the former IAAF president Lamine Diack, Papa Massata Diack\u2019s father, was arrested over allegations that he accepted more than \u20ac1m in bribes to cover up doping violations. His legal adviser, Habib Cisse, and Dolle were also arrested, while French prosecutors said Papa Massata Diack, Lamine\u2019s son who acted as a marketing consultant for the IAAF for eight years with a focus on developing markets, was told he would be questioned if he set foot in France. Papa Massata Diack was last week banned for life from the sport and Dolle, who the Guardian revealed had stepped down from his role last year amid an ethics investigation, was banned for five years following an investigation by the IAAF\u2019s independent ethics commission. Coe, who delivered a glowing tribute to Lamine Diack when he succeeded him in August, calling him his \u201cspiritual president\u201d, has said he was shocked by the involvement of the 82-year-old Senegalese in the corruption allegations. He has argued that his role as vice-president was limited to just 10 days of active duty a year and that his focus until 2012 was entirely on delivering the London Olympics. Much of the pressure on Coe stems from whether he should have questioned more closely the scale of the Russian doping crisis, which was being openly discussed in IAAF circles, and from his previous loyalty to Lamine Diack. His supporters point to his role in setting up the independent ethics committee that revealed the scale of the Russian cover-up and argue, that without Lamine Diack\u2019s support he would never have been able to win the presidency and the current situation would be even worse. Pound said in his report that the London Games was \u201csabotaged\u201d by Russian doping and the participation of athletes who should have been banned. The internal documents leaked this week to the Associated Press showed how Cisse and Dolle considered covering up Russian tests ahead of the Games. \u201cOur sport is a strong sport,\u201d insisted Coe on Wednesday. \u201cDon\u2019t run away with the idea that I don\u2019t know these are dark days. Of course they\u2019re dark days.\u201d Pound, who also criticised Wada in his first report, is expected to recommend inquiries into the scale of doping in other countries such as Kenya and Turkey. Renee Anne Shirley, the former head of the Jamaican Anti-Doping Commission and a trenchant critic of the IAAF\u2019s handling the issue, said it would be \u201cinteresting seeing Coe\u2019s continued tired defence of his sport\u201d and believed it had \u201clost the moral high ground\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
