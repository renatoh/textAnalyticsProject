On balance, that would be the Guardian\u2019s position too. On the other side of the UK opinion divide, a similar proportion are equally determined to vote to leave under all possible circumstances \u2013 some of them jumped the gun last night in a rally in London, as they were always going to do. But in the middle are a much larger number of voters than either of these groups \u2013 47% of the total in a poll earlier this month (pdf) \u2013 whose votes are either not set in stone or who genuinely don\u2019t know where they stand. These are the voters at whom Mr Cameron\u2019s midnight wrangling in Brussels with other EU leaders was mainly aimed. And these voters are right to look at the deal that was unveiled on Friday night, to weigh it as a practical set of proposals and to judge whether the Europe that it codifies is one of which Britain should remain a member. Nothing that Mr Cameron achieved in Brussels was ever likely to affect the intentions of the first two groups. But it does not follow that the talks over the last two days were therefore a charade or that they were somehow irrelevant to the decision that UK voters will now take. On the contrary. The don\u2019t-knows are likely to care a lot about the outcome that was confirmed on Friday and are right to do so. Their verdict will move votes one way or another. The fact that Mr Cameron, one of the few politicians with positive ratings, is recommending it may weigh with them too. The deal will need to be examined very carefully in detail. But Mr Cameron was very clear on Friday night that its contents were substantive not superficial. Only someone with an ideological objection to the EU as such could dismiss that claim wholesale. The deal achieves things that can make a difference. It exempts the UK from any political drive, admittedly these days a faltering one, towards \u201cever closer union\u201d. That may seem largely symbolic, but the symbol matters, not least in European law, and a nation that has rightly never wanted to be subsumed in a European superstate, albeit that this is largely a rightwing fantasy, can rest more contended on that count. The deal makes clear that the internal market will be expanded to include services. This may be an unfashionable achievement in some ways, but it means jobs and market access for British workers and companies, and it too cannot be dismissed as mere window-dressing. The safeguards for the non-eurozone part of the EU are safeguards that anyone who wants to remain in the EU while not joining the single currency \u2013 a position that a majority of UK voters support \u2013 will broadly endorse, even if it is simultaneously good news for the unpopular financial sector. The section on benefits for migrant workers is the most problematic part of the package. It was good that several EU member states made clear that they would not accept second-class treatment for their nationals. Nor should the UK have sought such a status for migrants who have come here to work and who are net contributors to the UK. Nevertheless, there need to be rules on benefits for migrant workers and the rules agreed should logically reassure British taxpayers while not mistreating migrants who are here already or rightly entitled to come here in future. In retrospect, it was probably always likely that the leaders would have to burn the midnight oil to get Britain\u2019s deal. With 28 national interests at stake, brinkmanship was wholly predictable. It was also highly likely that Downing Street wanted the summit to generate a long, tense media wait. Mr Cameron had to emerge from the summit having gone the extra mile to get what he wanted. No one can reasonably say he did not do that. His readiness to do so makes the predetermined ideological opponents of Europe \u2014 or in some cases the opportunists \u2014 who will follow Michael Gove into the Leave campaign look mean-spirited and disloyal. Mr Cameron did not need to take the route he has taken on Europe in the first place. The whole renegotiation was a gambling of Britain\u2019s place in Europe in the cause of Tory party management. But, having embarked on it, he has delivered a package that those who have not made up their minds should take very seriously indeed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
