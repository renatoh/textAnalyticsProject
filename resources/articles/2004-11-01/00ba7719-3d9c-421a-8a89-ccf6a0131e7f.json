All over America millions of viewers stayed up late waiting to find out the result of that referendum on a regional assembly for the north-east of England. In bars in the midwest, tattooed truckers and Vietnam vets anxiously bit their lips as CNN reported that exit polls from Chester-le-Street made the referendum too close to call. \"Jeez, if the Welsh and Scotch can have assemblies, why not the Geordies?\" \"Because it's an unnecessary tier of bureaucracy you schmuck; Bishop Auckland and Hartlepool already have local councils ...\" And again these bitter divisions spilled over into physical violence. Taking this much interest was the least the Americans could do after the rest of the world had sat up all night waiting to see who would win the US presidency. And what a thrilling night's television it was! The BBC wheeled out heavyweight American commentators, like former assistant speechwriter to Gary Hart's friend, telling us it was too early to say one way or the other. \"When might we get to the situation when people are no longer saying 'It's too early to say'?\" \"It's too early to say.\" Then we'd cut back to Peter Snow pointlessly jumping around a giant map of the US, dodging animated graphics of Ohio that kept popping up and nearly knocking him over. There was not much more information over on CNN or Sky News (although by accidentally landing on the WWF wrestling channel you could at least get a reminder of what a more dignified contest looked like). Early signs were encouraging. \"No incumbent president has ever won in the same year that the Minnesota Bluebirds have come third in the ice hockey play-offs.\" \"Yes, and just as in 1960 the Democrats have a candidate with the initials JFK who is a senator from Massachusetts and a navy war veteran.\" Yup, and then John Kerry went and got murdered by a nutcase from Texas. Like Charlie Brown kicking the football, yet again we had allowed ourselves to believe the exit polls (so called because putting your faith in them makes you want to join Exit). To make it even more annoying, people who hadn't really been following it would glance at the telly and say, \"Wow, that looks promising!\" seeing the great wash of red across middle America. \"No\", we groaned, \"the red states are Republican ones. The Democrat states are those tiny blue ones up in the north-east.\" Finally, when it became clear that there are lies, damned lies and exit polls, we went to bed in disgust, having left a message at work to say we wouldn't be in today because we were emigrating to Jupiter. Damn, they went and made the bastard legitimate! Up until Tuesday \"President Bush\" was an oxymoron. Now he's thrown off that tag. Or at least shortened it a bit. Meanwhile, Kerry will have to find something else to do with his leadership skills. Apparently a vacancy's coming up at the PLO that he might consider. But there are shreds of hope to be taken from all of this. This was not the electoral catastrophe for the Democrats that some commentators are making out. An unimpressive Democratic candidate polled more votes than any Republican had ever received before Tuesday; a million more than Reagan got in his landslide of '84, more votes than Nixon got in '72 when he won 49 states out of 50; in fact, Kerry got the second highest number of votes for any presidential candidate ever. The only negative (admittedly quite a big one) is that the new record was set by his rival on Tuesday. In one sense, Global Village Idiot does now represent all of the American people; half of his smile is smug and happy, the left hand side of his mouth is turned down in a bitter sneer. But there's not much evidence to suggest that America will have more to smile about in four years' time. Because on the Wednesday morning, the Republicans stumbled back into the White House with a terrible hangover, looking at their wrecked offices the night after the party. \"Oh no, we completely trashed the place! We thought the other lot were going to have to clear up this mess. We're billions in debt, industry's destroyed and the rest of the world hates us; how the hell did we get landed with sorting out all this?\" Dubya was quick to clarify things: \"We're gonna reunificate the country; continuising our economical strategums and re-envigorising the Middle Eastern peace processor.\" Still, it could be worse, he could have a dreadful brother ready to replace him in 2008. Yes, Tuesday's result was a disaster but hey, it's not the end of the world. Apparently that's pencilled in for early next year. comment@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
