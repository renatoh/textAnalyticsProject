West Hertfordshire Hospitals trust became the latest trust to be ordered to make big improvements after the Care Quality Commission watchdog rated its services overall as \u201cinadequate\u201d. CQC inspectors who visited the trust\u2019s three hospitals in April and May uncovered a series of problems, including: \u2022 A&amp;E patients at Watford general hospital facing long delays before they were examined by a doctor. \u2022 Untrained staff assessing and directing the care of A&amp;E arrivals. \u2022 A chronic lack of nurses so serious that it posed \u201ca major risk\u201d to patients. \u2022 Major staff shortages in its maternity unit too. \u2022 Patient safety \u201cwas not a sufficient priority\u201d. \u2022 A failure to act on the lessons of previous patient safety incidents. \u2022 Facilities were in such a bad state of repair that they \u201ccaused a potential risk to staff and visitors\u201d. \u2022 Vital equipment, including that for resuscitating patients, was not always checked to ensure it was working. In one of his most critical recent judgments on an NHS trust, Prof Sir Mike Richards, the CQC\u2019s chief inspector of hospitals, said his team\u2019s findings meant he had to recommend the trust was put into the special measures regime. The NHS Trust Development Authority (NTDA), which oversees non-foundation trust hospitals, agreed to his request about the trust, which provides care for about 500,000 people in West Hertfordshire. CQC inspectors led by Tony Berendt, the medical director of Oxford University Hospitals NHS trust, said that although most staff were caring, compassionate and kind, quality of care was undermined by longstanding understaffing and over-reliance on agency and locum staff. While care in children\u2019s and young people\u2019s services was outstanding, \u201cwe found that the approach of some staff within the maternity unit and outpatient department required improvement\u201d, said Richards. Low morale was common. The CQC\u2019s report on the trust highlights that staff did not always report patient safety incidents, \u201cthere was a lack of a safety culture\u201d and \u201cthe trust lacked a systematic approach to the reporting and analysis of incidents. Where concerns, incidents and patient complaints were raised, or things went wrong, the approach to reviewing, investigating and learning was slow and in some cases absent.\u201d Richards, though, praised the trust\u2019s interim chief executive, Jac Kelly, for understanding the problems there and taking decisive action to tackle them. Kelly said: \u201cI am confident that the energy and focus of staff in continuing to deliver improvements that are already making a difference for patients, together with the support we will receive through special measures, means we will progress even faster.\u201d Mark Cubbon, the NTDA\u2019s portfolio director, said the trust would receive support to help it improve its services and quality of care. An improvement director will be appointed to help speed up that process."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
