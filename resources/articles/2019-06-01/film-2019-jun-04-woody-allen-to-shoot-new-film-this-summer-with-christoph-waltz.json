The writer-director was dropped by Amazon after a resurfaced allegation of sexual abuse but has found funding from Mediapro, the company who also produced his films Midnight In Paris and Vicky Cristina Barcelona. Allen has always denied the claim. The film is as yet untitled but during production it will be known as WASP2019 and features a cast largely made up of European talent, including two-time Oscar winner Waltz, The Skin I Live in and Wonder Woman star Elena Anaya, Pan\u2019s Labyrinth villain Sergi L\u00f3pez and The Dreamers star Louis Garrel. The two confirmed American cast members are Showgirls star Gershon and Wallace Shawn, who has previously worked with Allen in Manhattan, Radio Days and Shadows and Fog. Allen will also collaborate again with Oscar-winning cinematographer Vittorio Storaro. The plot will follow an American couple at the San Sebasti\u00e1n film festival who find their marriage tested when he falls for a \u201cbeautiful Spanish woman\u201d and she for a \u201cbrilliant French movie director\u201d. It will shoot from July to August. \u201cThis latest movie has all the ingredients to be right up there along with what we\u2019ve become accustomed to from a director of Woody Allen\u2019s talent: an intelligent script and a first-rate international cast,\u201d said Jaume Roures of Mediapro. The new film follows Allen\u2019s $68m lawsuit aimed at Amazon for dropping him from a four-movie deal. The director had released just one film with them to date, the critically loathed drama Wonder Wheel starring Kate Winslet, and had finished production on A Rainy Day in New York starring Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet. After a resurfaced allegation of sexual abuse from his daughter Dylan Farrow, a claim that he has categorically denied, the film was shelved. His filing read: \u201cAmazon has tried to excuse its action by referencing a 25-year-old, baseless allegation against Mr Allen, but that allegation was already well known to Amazon (and the public) before Amazon entered into four separate deals with Mr Allen \u2013 and, in any event it does not provide a basis for Amazon to terminate the contract \u2026 There simply was no legitimate ground for Amazon to renege on its promises.\u201d Last month it was announced that the film would be released in Italy with rumours of deals in other European countries. Allen claims he is owed $9m as he financed the production himself. Since allegations resurfaced, many actors who have previously starred in his films, including Greta Gerwig, Ellen Page, Rebecca Hall and Colin Firth, have stated that they wouldn\u2019t work with Allen again. When asked about Allen in 2018, Gershon was cautious about expressing a definitive opinion. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the real truth is,\u201d she said in a Jezebel interview. \u201cI\u2019m not one to judge him. I saw his band. I thought his band was awesome.\u201d In 2014, Shawn defended Allen saying it would take \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d to convince him of guilt."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
