Even before he gatecrashed last year\u2019s Tory leadership contest, knocking his supposed friend Boris Johnson out of the race, Gove was a deeply controversial figure. Accompanied by his loyal adviser Dominic Cummings, who went on to mastermind the Vote Leave campaign in last year\u2019s referendum, Gove slashed and burned his way through decades of conventional wisdom in education \u2013 making an enemy of the teaching unions in the process. From his bid to take climate change out of the geography curriculum, to the expansion of the use of untrained teachers, to dispatching a Bible to every school, he frequently infuriated the educational establishment \u2013 but his allies insist he was working tirelessly to drive up standards, not deliberately picking battles. At the justice department, he was working on plans for reforming prisons, including bringing in league tables, before he was booted out by Theresa May. Some of the cabinet ministers sacked in the unexpectedly brutal reshuffle when May arrived in Number 10 Downing Street last summer have spent the past year reaping their revenge \u2013 in George Osborne\u2019s case, with evident glee. But Gove, who was dumped after losing out to May in the leadership race, has largely stuck to the role of loyal Tory backbencher \u2013 albeit with a lucrative sideline in journalism. The only memorable embarrassment he has caused his erstwhile rival for the Tory leadership was by pipping her to a meeting with the US president \u2013 conducting an interview for the Times at which it later transpired the paper\u2019s owner, Rupert Murdoch, had been a silent witness. Friends say Gove\u2019s last-minute decision to enter the Tory leadership race was less because he craved the job for himself and more a kamikaze bid to save Britain from his old Oxford rival Boris Johnson \u2013 whose leadership campaign he was meant to be in charge of. Johnson tweeted his reaction to the appointment: Gove\u2019s late entry into the running, just hours before Johnson had invited journalists and political backers to a Mayfair hotel to launch his own candidacy, was regarded by many of his colleagues as an act of ruthless betrayal. Johnson was the affable public face of Brexit; but many senior Tories believe Gove brought an intellectual heft that helped make the cause politically respectable. Downing Street suggested that Gove\u2019s appointment was a \u201cbold move\u201d, underlining erstwhile rivals, as she rebuilds her authority in the wake of Thursday\u2019s general election result. But government sources suggested Gove had already patched up his differences with team May and even with the now-departed Fiona Hill, who was sacked from her post as adviser to May in the Home Office after briefing against him to the press. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs faces some of the toughest challenges of any Whitehall department as Brexit looms. The EU Common Agricultural Policy, which many farmers rely on for a significant chunk of their income, will have to be replaced with a UK-focused system. And the Common Fisheries Policy, which Gove blamed for the loss of his father\u2019s fish-processing business, is also likely to have to be replaced with a new arrangement. Allies said Gove\u2019s fearsome intellect and enthusiasm for the nitty-gritty details of policy would serve him well in the new role \u2013 but it is unclear whether May\u2019s government will survive long enough for anyone to find out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
