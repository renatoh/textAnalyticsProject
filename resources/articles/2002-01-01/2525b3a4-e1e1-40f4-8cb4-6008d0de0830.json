Mascarenhas made his fortune selling rights deals to the 1996 World Cup and was closely allied at the time to Jagmohan Dalmiya, now president of the Indian board and, at the time, chairman of the International Cricket Council. Mascarenhas's stock had fallen substantially in recent times. His company, World Tel, gradually lost its cricket rights in India, Sharjah and finally Bangladesh, and doubts were being cast increasingly on his ruthless management style. At the time of his death, while driving a car near Nagpur on Saturday evening, Mascarenhas, a bullish, extrovert figure - India's Henry VIII, said one close acquaintance yesterday - largely maintained his cricketing links through Tendulkar. The Indian batsman, clearly shaken, missed yesterday's team meeting while he was informed of the news but later joined the squad in the nets. Sourav Ganguly, India's captain, who was also managed by Mascarenhas for four years, confirmed that Tendulkar would play in today's match. When the subcontinent staged the 1996 World Cup, Dalmiya auctioned the TV rights to World Tel for \u00a310m. Mascarenhas sold the secondary rights so aggressively that profits of around \u00a335m were generated. The ICC became richer than ever before but accounts were never published and Dalmiya, his reputation increasingly tarnished by negative publicity, took increasing care to distance himself from Mascarenhas's dealings. Allegations about the mis-sale of TV rights in India prompted the Indian CBI to launch an investigation, still incomplete. Dalmiya and Mascarenhas both denied any wrongdoing. However the ICC's Condon inquiry into match-fixing, and other practices, recommended that the ICC \"develop an internal audit function to avoid the perception or reality of misappropriation of large sums of money generated from the sale of television rights\". \u00b7 South Africa's left-arm spinner Nicky Boje took four wickets as New Zealand were beaten by 93 runs in the one-day international in Adelaide. Mark Boucher scored 57 not out from 32 balls to win the man-of-the-match award."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
