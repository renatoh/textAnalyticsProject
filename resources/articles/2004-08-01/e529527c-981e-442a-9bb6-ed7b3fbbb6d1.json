The two cats, Tabouli and Baba Ganoush, were born in June after being cloned from Tahini, a Bengal cat, and are said to be normal and healthy. Tahini is owned by the son of Lou Hawthorne, chief executive of US company Genetic Savings &amp; Clone. He cloned his son's cat to test the procedure before reproducing them for customers. The firm is cloning five cats for their owners, and the litters should be born by the end of the year. A different method of cloning is used to the one that produced Dolly the sheep. The company says its method is more efficient, although independent scientists said this was not proven. It is trying to clone a dog at present. \"The cats might look similar, but that doesn't mean they are going to be the same in terms of behaviour,\" said Dr Robin Lovell-Badge of the Medical Research Council."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
