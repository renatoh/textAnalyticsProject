The match and the slam. This was probably their poorest performance of the campaign but they did what they needed to. They preyed on the weak French lineout and, despite their own indiscipline, prevented France from creating a single chance. Indeed the home side were even worse, Scott Spedding aside, and never looked like scoring a try. Anyone who says this was an easy grand slam is an idiot, of course. Winning all five matches, especially when you\u2019re a team everyone takes extra pleasure in beating, is an excellent achievement. Never mind where they were six months ago. Never mind that they had only two home games. Never mind that this is a young team with 16 players born in the 1990s and a new coach. Congratulations England, Eddie Jones and Dylan Hartley \u2013 whom we all desperately hope is OK \u2013 on a fine, fine Six Nations and grand slam title. There\u2019s a long way to go, but they\u2019ve shown they\u2019re capable of rapid improvement. That\u2019s it from me for this championship, what with it having finished and all. Thanks to all for reading, writing in, tweeting and suchlike. Apologies to anyone whose correspondence I couldn\u2019t use. Match reports, reaction and the like will be right here soon enough. Bye! That\u2019s it! Ben Youngs thumps it into touch and England have won the grand slam! 80 min Knocked on on halfway by Lauret with 25 seconds left on the clock. Time for the one final play and that will be that. 79 min From the restart, Ford thumps it long and France have to run from their own 22. \u201cBeen a long season Dan,\u201d writes Simon McMahon. \u201cYou deserve a drink. And have one for me too. Cheers.\u201d Fifteen in from the right, on the 22, Farrell drills it over and England are surely there? 77 min Bezy is on for Machenaud too. Clifford takes the lineout and England drive the maul into the 22, splitting the French forwards. They have a penalty coming too, so Ford has a go at the drop. He misses, but we go back for the original offence and, furthermore, Chiocci is sent to the sin bin for pulling down the maul. 76 min Under great pressure from Kruis, Machenaud clears to touch but only on his own 22. This is a great position for England and you feel that any points they can get from here would win the match. Clifford comes on for his clubmate Robshaw. 75 min France drive on, 15 metres inside the England half looking to crash their big men over the gainline, but then Haskell comes good and wins the turnover. Ben Youngs kicks the turnover ball away and Spedding, then Vakatawa bring it back. This time Brown wins the turnover and kicks it away, into the 22. 74 min Chat\u2019s throw is picked off by Kruis and Cowan-Dickie makes good ground carrying through the middle. Recycled but another knock on and France have a chance to counter now. They fling it left to Vakatawa and Nowell is too narrow, but the wing gets across well to cover. 73 min England secure the ball from a short restart kick and Ford finds touch on the left, on the French 22, with a lovely cross-kick. 48 metres with the slightest of angles, this one. Farrell keeps his cool and slots it! 71 min France with it on halfway but Lauret knocks on and England ship it right from Farrell to Nowell albeit on the bounce. They get a penalty for a high tackle on Youngs by Jedrasiak and Farrell, from a long long way out, is going to have a crack at goal. 70 min Through the phases but England aren\u2019t getting quick ball and Joseph is driven out of the 22. Cole takes it on but holds on in the tackle. Spedding does the usual and clears to touch down the right, into the England half. Lauret comes on for Goujon, Medard for Mermoz. 69 min We\u2019re going to restart with a scrum to England after Dylan Hartley, knocked out cold, is stretchered off to applause from the whole crowd. Vunipola charges off the back of it, through two tackles and into the 22. This is horrible to see. Hartley hasn\u2019t moved since hitting the the turf and we\u2019re having a lengthy delay while they get him on the stretcher. This really doesn\u2019t look good. Hartley went in low to tackle Atonio and his head caught the giant prop\u2019s knee. The stretcher is out and he\u2019s not going to be able to continue. Luke Cowan-Dickie will see out the match. 68 min Free-kick to England for an early engagement by Chiocci. Ford puts it up high and Spedding takes. The much-maligned No15 has been excellent tonight. Ooh and then a collision in midfield has left Hartley out cold on the turf. 67 min Chat comes on for Guirado as the 16 grown men playing in the respective packs attempt to get this game restarted via the medium of a scrum. Look it\u2019s harder than it sounds. 66 min Spedding kicks to touch inside the England half on the left. I feel like I\u2019ve written that sentence before. They shorten the lineout but it\u2019s still not working for them: the ball goes loose but Kruis is adjudged to have knocked on first. 65 min It\u2019s scrappy but Maestri grabs it and bullocks his way out the 22. Itoje is penalised for an illegal clearout on the scrum-half with the shoulder. 64 min England go left and Nowell steps inside, over halfway after coming round off his wing. Ford kicks cutely over the top and finds touch just inside the France 22 on the right. Pressure on Guirado here as he\u2019s struggled with his throwing tonight. 63 min Lineout just outside the England 22 but Itoje steals it again! Ford and Spedding exchange kicks, the latter finding touch on the England 10 metre line. 62 min And France\u2019s new front row has an immediate effect, winning the penalty when England pull the scrum down. Spedding clears into the England half on the left. 61 min Spedding shows England how it\u2019s done and makes a fast, clean exit from the restart. By his standards it\u2019s not a great kick actually as England have a lineout on their right, a few metres outside the French 22. Kruis takes it and sets the maul but France defend it very well. Cole is hit hard but offloads well and Haskell carries it into the 22. They recycle and Itoje knocks it on. This has been a very poor game if we\u2019re honest. From wide on the left, Machenaud kicks his SEVENTH penalty. 59 min Flanquart, Poirot and Slimani make their exits to be replaced by Jedrasiak, Atonio and Chiocci. From the restart, Nowell is isolated, holds on and concedes another kickable penalty. 57 min From the touchline, Farrell hooks it left and there\u2019s still only a score in it. Vunipola has plenty of space and smashes through Plisson, up over halfway. Youngs spots a gap and goes flying into the 22. He should just give it left and send it through the hands, he kicks instead but gets away with it as Watson gathers well and goes over in the corner! 55 min England go left, they have a number of mismatches and indeed an overlap! Brown, in no space at all, kicks and has it charged down. The two teams scramble for the ball like two bald men fighting over a comb and eventually France knock it forward. 54 min Youngs clears, Fofana fields and Cole wins the turnover on the floor. He\u2019s been very good tonight, actually. Farrell steps, gets into trouble and Ford has to clear with his left. Spedding comes back and Farrell wins another turnover! 53 min England come battering back into the French defence from the drop-out and Marler makes a half break. Joseph tries to take it on then gives away a penalty for a double movement midway inside the French half. Thoughtless from the Bath centre. Spedding sends it to touch on the England 22 but Kruis steals it. 52 min Nowell chases the restart and manages to tackle Vakatawa for once. And the better news for England is that he\u2019s secured the turnover on the French 22! It\u2019s scrappy ball though so Ford tries a snap drop-goal from 25 metres, but pulls it just wide. It was a rubbish pass to him, behind his back, by Youngs in fairness. Hartley might feel hard done by there as he had actually won the turnover and secured possession by ripping the ball from Goujon. \u201cDiscipline!\u201d shouts Farrell. No matter for Machenaud, who kicks another simple penalty from the left. 49 min Spedding\u2019s clearance is excellent as ever, finding touch on halfway on the right. And from the lineout Plisson chips over the top and Mermoz gathers it. They drive up to within 25 metres and this time Hartley is the man to concede a penalty for not releasing the tackled man. 48 min Brown kicks down the throat of Spedding and Chouly carries it back. France get the advantage for a knock-on on the floor but Plisson kicks that away and Vunipola makes ground, carrying up towards the 22 down the left-hand channel. One of the big difference between Lancaster\u2019s England and Jones\u2019s is the variety of angles of attack around the breakdown and, as if to exemplify that, Itoje picks a good line and makes more ground. Then Brown gives away a penalty for crossing. England need to get Brown off sharpish. 47 min Vunipola charges into the equally massive Flanquart and the ball gets held up in the ruck. England scrum just outside their own 22. From 35 metres, just off to the right of the tricolored sticks, Farrell just squeezes it inside the right-hand post. Five points in it again. 44 min Youngs is on for Care, who had been England\u2019s most dangerous attacker. The restart is long, Plisson clears to Brown who runs back and England get a penalty straight away for hands in the ruck from Le Roux. Right in front of the posts, seven metres out. Funnily enough, Machenaud gets it. 42 min Vakatawa in no space at all steps through Nowell yet again and bustles into the 22! He offloads to Le Roux, who is dragged down. It looked to be a forward pass but it\u2019s not called and France get a penalty for offside. 41 min Plisson gets us going again and Vunipola is wrapped up inside his 22 straight away. Care clears and Goujon takes on halfway. France go through the phases looking for the holes that were so plentiful in the first half. The players are back out. Joe Marler is on for Mako Vunipola, to well-deserved boos. France cut England to ribbons at will to begin with and England will be pleased \u2013 to a small degree \u2013 not to have let them over the line in the opening 15 minutes. They came back well with two very sharply taken tries, but the back row is taking some punishment and they\u2019ve given away far, far too many penalties \u2013 six, of which four have been kickable and indeed kicked. England\u2019s tackle percentage was pathetic too: a 72% success rate including 16 misses. Half-time reading John Ashdown on when this fixture got a tiny bit tasty. From wide on the right, just inside the 22, Farrell looks to me to have slotted the kick. The flags stay down though and England go in just five points ahead. They\u2019re lucky to have that to be honest, it\u2019s not been very good. England penalty as Slimani loses his bind. 40 min Vakatawa runs the restart back and Machenaud knocks on at the breakdown with seconds left on the clock. We have time for one more set-piece, an England scrum a few metres inside the France 22 on the right. From around 16 metres to the right, just outside the 22, Machenaud gets his side back within a score. England are lucky to be ahead, quite frankly. 38 min But France come back quickly and get another penalty at the breakdown for the tackler failing to release. Robshaw and Haskell are getting killed out there. 37 min The loose ball goes through to England though and, after Watson made good ground, Care clears... 36 min Solid scrum from France and, after Machenaud clears, it\u2019s a great kick-chase too. Le Roux tackles Watson just inside the French half, the wing holds on under pressure from Mermoz and France get a penalty, which Spedding spanks into touch down the right. One for every three penalties, I believe? My apologies, the first knock-on was by Vunipola, then Brown. 36 min Brown drops it again. 35 min Vunipola off the back, then Nowell gets his head down and drives through several tackles. Left and Haskell takes it into contact WITHOUT GIVING A PENALTY AWAY! England around eight metres out now. 34 min Le Roux can\u2019t control it at the back and Machenaud knocks on. Now it\u2019s an England scrum 10 metres out on the right. They\u2019ll like this. 33 min Nowell shrugs off a tackle and fires it wide to Brown, but France drift across and Spedding tackles him. The forwards come piling in to secure the ball but knock it forward in doing so. 32 min England lineout on the 22. Hartley finds Itoje and they work it through the hands to Watson, who has come into midfield. Really strong defence from France though, he drive B Vunipola then Robshaw back. 31 min England have the lineout six metres inside their own half. Kruis takes, the pack drives and the penalty arrives for side entry into the maul. It\u2019s well out of Farrell\u2019s range, just inside his own half, so the Saracens man kicks to touch down the left. 30 min An exchange of kicks and Brown gets into trouble, being turned over on halfway. Machenaud, perhaps inspired by Care earlier, has a burst but Watson covers it well and sends him into touch. 30 metres out and that\u2019s pretty easy. Credit has to go to Guirado for his work in the tackle on Haskell to win that penalty by the way, great body shape. 29 min England swing it left infield, James Haskell takes it into contact and inevitably gives away a penalty for holding on. You knew that was coming as soon as he took the tackle. 28 min Hartley\u2019s throw isn\u2019t taken cleanly by Itoje but the England captain is on hand to secure the ball allowing Care to box kick clear. Vakatawa comes back but it\u2019s scrappy once he\u2019s tackled and Itoje wins the turnover. 27 min Fofana steps beautifully outside Watson in no space at all and gets just about into the 22. They switch left and, though England\u2019s line speed is good, Vakatawa uses his strength to plunder down the touchline. Nowell is left in the dirt but Farrell gets across to take the big wing into touch. Nowell is struggling badly. 26 min Maestri wins the lineout midway inside the England half and France batter away, going right then back left. 25 min Hartley finds Itoje in the middle and England set the maul from which Care looks for a gap again. He looks so much more threatening than Ben Youngs it has to be said. England turn it over and Fickou clears. Ford returns to touch with a poor kick that barely leaves his own 22. 24 min Plisson goes high and is very nearly charged down by Care. France knock on while chasing, then exacerbate their error as Poirot goes off his feet at a subsequent breakdown. Farrell, from halfway, kicks to touch on the left inside the 22. 23 min Ford goes high from the lineout and Joseph can\u2019t get to it ahead of Fickou. France recycle midway inside their own half then Fickou dummies and looks to put Fickou away. England are alert this time though. 22 min Again the restart is shallow and again tapped back on the French side by Chouly. Left they go but Vakatawa steps into touch. From 10 metres to the left, Farrell adds the extras. That was as great finish by Cole, it has to be said. Nowell makes ground in the middle, then Care snipes and can\u2019t quite get there. It\u2019s recycled though and Cole uses his strength to roll over Guirado, through Spedding\u2019s tackle and over the line! The TMO wants to check for a block by Mako V, but one replay is all Owens needs to decide the try is good! 19 min Again it\u2019s quick ball from England and Ford finds Watson with a cross-kick! He takes it on and chips into the 22, where Joseph gathers! England work it right but France\u2019s defence scrambles back so they go through the phases. Billy V crashes up to within 10 then his brother gains a couple more metres. 18 min France have the lineout five metres inside the England half. They win it but can\u2019t find a hole in the defence, for one, so Mermoz threads a bit of a nothing grubber kick through and into touch on the left, just over the England 10 metre line. 17 min Vakatawa runs it back out the 22 and, though he\u2019s chopped down by Farrell, he gets it away and Spedding bursts away down the right for France! He chips ahead into the 22 but Nowell gets back, England recycle and Ford makes the exit. That\u2019s more terrible tackling from England though and they\u2019ll be punished soon if they keep this crap up. From 10 metres inside the right-hand touchline, Machenaud clumps it right between the posts. 15 min Down goes Mako Vunipola and France get the penalty. Machenaud will presumably knock this one over. 14 min France reclaim the restart when Brown spills it. No advantage so we\u2019ll have the first scrum on the France right, around five metres outside the England 22. Farrell kicks it from under the posts. Bad news for France though as Trinh-Duc has turned his ankle nastily and is carried off. Plisson on. Farrell finds touch on the left, five metres inside the France half. That\u2019s a great kick and England go quickly off the lineout. Joseph takes it into contact and Care sees a massive hole! He darts round the ruck, god alone knows where the full-back is and Care has a free run to the posts from 40 metres! 11 min Still France have it and Fofana, off his wing, carries up to the 22 on the left. They recycle and Hartley plays on the edge of offside very cleverly to slow it down. Still the blue shirts come and Poirot goes into the 22, but Slimani goes off his feet and England finally get some relief. 10 min Care clears too long again and Vakatawa runs back through Nowell. You get the feeling it\u2019s only a matter of time before France score. 9 min Kruis takes the lineout again despite a touch of confusion over the call and Billy Vunipola takes it up to the 22. Care clears and Fofana catches and comes back. Left it goes to Spedding and he breaks between Billy V and Farrell before giving it left to Vakatawa! Great work from the full-back, but Vakatawa\u2019s final pass goes into touch when Fickou was clear. 8 min Kruis takes the throw and is immediately driven back. England reset the maul and go forwards, before Robshaw bursts. They go left to Brown and he bursts through a weak challenge from Fickou before sending a wild pass inside to no one and Flanquart picks it up for France. Bah! Machenaud kicks down field and finds a great touch on the right, midway inside the England 22. 7 min France start the driving maul and rumble almost 20 metres upfield into the England half before going wide left across the field. Vakatawa turns on the gas and shrugs off Nowell before giving it inside to Guirado, but Brown had already knocked the wing into touch. 6 min Trinh-Duc\u2019s restart is taken in by Kruis midway inside the England half and they go left through the hands. Joseph steps and tries to get the legs pumping, up into the French half but Fofana has him well marked and, with the help of Fickou, bundles the centre into touch. Chouly takes the lineout. It thuds into the far post and bounces through. As you were. 4 min England this time get the penalty at the restart; Watson claimed it and the French tackler took him around the head. Owen Farrell is going for an immediate response from wide on the left, 35 metres or so out. From the 22, just to the right, Machenaud helps himself to an easy three points. 2 min The camera angles from the BBC are atrocious, more befitting a music video with the fast cuts. They pick and drive before Spedding has a dart into the 22 where he\u2019s dragged down by Robshaw. Another penalty to France though as Itoje goes off his feet. 1 min At the referee\u2019s signal, George Ford kicks off and France get a penalty immediately as Fickou is taken out in the air by Watson. Inauspicious, is the word that comes to mind. Spedding kicks to touch down the right, giving his side a lineout just outside the England 22 where Flanquart takes and sets the driving maul. Darryl Penson writes: \u201cFrance will play with flair and energy, but their defence won\u2019t be able to keep a few tries out. France 16, England 31.\u201d Anthems time. England are in excellent voice for an away side. They have an awful lot of critics they want to shut up tonight and you get the feeling there\u2019s no one better to captain them in that situation than Dylan Hartley. La Marseillaise is sung with equal gusto. Call this one a draw. Atmosphere watch The Stade de France is absolutely rocking. There are an estimated 15-20,000 England fans there, though according to Castaignede the French will be passionate about spoiling England\u2019s party. \u201cA win tonight is like a grand slam for us,\u201d he says. Decent shout, this: Some good news tonight: Nigel Owens takes charge of his first match of the championship. Here\u2019s an interview he gave to Kevin Mitchell back in the heady days of 2009. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the likes of Dusautoir and Betsen,\u201d says Thomas Castaignede, discussing Northampton-bound Louis Picamoles\u2019s injury, \u201cso we have Goujon coming in.\u201d Yes, that says it all. \u201cHi Dan,\u201d writes James Austin. \u201cWhile we\u2019re waiting for The Biggest Game Ever to kick off I was wondering what everyone\u2019s Lions team would be (which, due to the ineptitude of the Italians and French, also doubles as the team of the championship) I reckon: J. Marler, D. Hartley, A.P Nel, M.Itoje, A. W. Jones, S. Warbuton, C.J Stander, B. Vunipola, G. Laidlaw, J. Sexton, G. North, D. Taylor, J. Joseph, A. Watson, S. Hogg Replacements: S. Lee, R.Ford, M. Vunipola, G. Kruis, J. Haskell, C. Murray, O. Farrell, J. Nowell\u201d If we were doing a team of the Championship then Campagnaro and Guirado would be in for me. As for the Lions, mine\u2019s: Hogg; Watson, Joseph, Roberts, North; Biggar, Laidlaw; McGrath, Hartley, Nel, Itoje, AW Jones, Stander, Hardie, Billy V. Replacements Baldwin, R Evans, Lee, J Gray, Warburton, Webb, Farrell, Seymour. Imagine being on a train with these lads. Predictions then, folks? It\u2019s cold but dry in Paris and the pitch should be nice and firm, which will allow for a free-flowing game if we\u2019re lucky. I\u2019m going for England by 15; I can\u2019t see a French player that would get into the England XV in the position picked. How will England win though? Dean Ryan has the answers so you don\u2019t have to watch the match . In case you didn\u2019t realise, and I have no idea how this might happen, this is the Six Nations finale main course after two appetisers. Earlier today Wales gave Italy a mighty panning and Ireland were too strong for Scotland in Dublin. Here\u2019s how those two went. Evening, folks. Two outta three may have been good enough for Meat Loaf but the feeling is that for Eddie Jones\u2019s England, four outta five just won\u2019t do. After all, Stuart Lancaster managed that four years on the spin and the fans and pundits have (retrospectively) decided that \u2013 and the four accompanying second-place finishes \u2013 were not good enough. England don\u2019t have to worry about the latter part, having had the title kindly secured for them by Scotland last Sunday. However you get the feeling that the only way to fully earn the respect of the wider rugby world will be to win the grand slam. They last did it in 2003 and you would think that tonight in Paris is their best chance since then. They have been here before: five times in the expanded Six Nations, in fact, with just that one win in Dublin to show for it. In 2000 Scotland played the mud and the rain better to shock Clive Woodward\u2019s team. The following year, in October, they went to Dublin for a postponed finale and were beaten 20-14, leaving Matt Dawson and Martin Johnson to grimace awkwardly as they lifted the trophy. A decade later Johnson was coach but another defeat in Dublin, a more resounding 24-8 defeat, meant another bittersweet title triumph. And then there was the debacle of 2013, when England went to Cardiff full of pomp and confidence and ended up on the end of the mother of all spankings, 30-3 to Sam Warburton\u2019s team There is one key difference this time though: all of those conquerors, perhaps with the exception of Scotland in 2000, were much better teams than this French one. They have a new coach in Guy Noves and a number of new exciting players, but the story is the same as it has been for a decade or so: muddled selection and a gameplan that, while for once ambitious and exciting, doesn\u2019t suit the players they have. France top the offload count by a long way but if they show the same kind of sloppiness they did in defeats to Scotland and Wales \u2013 and they weren\u2019t much better in beating Italy and Ireland \u2013 then Maro Itoje, James Haskell and Chris Robshaw should make mincemeat of them. Noves has only made a couple of changes from the side that went down to Scotland in the last round, both in the back row. Bernard le Roux is in for the first time since the World Cup quarter-final thrashing by New Zealand and Bourdeaux\u2019s Louann Goujon is at No8 with Damien Chouly moving to blindside. England have made a couple of changes too. The most notable sees Joe Marler drop to the bench after he somehow escaped a ban for saying racist things and smashing his forearm into a man\u2019s head. The former was apparently OK because it was said in the heat of the moment \u2013 if only Dylan Hartley had known this when saying a bad word near Wayne Barnes, eh? \u2013 and the latter wasn\u2019t a red card offence because, let\u2019s face it, is concussion really that big a risk? Oh. The other change sees Danny Care\u2019s dodgy box kicking replace Ben Youngs\u2019 dodgy passing. Oh for a fit Joe Simpson. Kick-off is at 8pm GMT, or 9pm in Paris. Here are the teams: France Scott Spedding (Clermont); Wesley Fofana (Clermont), Ga\u00ebl Fickou (Toulouse), Maxime Mermoz (Toulon), Virimi Vakatawa (FFR); Fran\u00e7ois Trinh-Duc (Montpellier), Maxime Machenaud (Racing 92); Jefferson Poirot (Bordeaux-B\u00e8gles), Guilhem Guirado (Toulon), Rabah Slimani (Stade Fran\u00e7ais), Alexandre Flanquart (Stade Fran\u00e7ais), Yoann Maestri (Toulouse), Damien Chouly (Clermont), Bernard Le Roux (Racing 92), Loann Goujon (Bordeaux-B\u00e8gles).
