Then there\u2019s the Australian who claimed Olympic gold in London and backed it up four years later with a silver medal in Rio. Yet for the duration of the America\u2019s Cup regatta in May and June, Lake Macquarie local Nathan Outteridge will be steering the hopes of the Swedish entry, Artemis Racing. Meanwhile Team New Zealand has another Australian, Victorian skipper Glenn Ashby. A world champion sailor, Ashby might hail from Bendigo, but is tilting towards trans-Tasman sailing in search of glory. With Australia failing to mount an America\u2019s Cup challenger for the last three decades and an entrant for the last 17 years a generation of the nation\u2019s finest sailors have long had no alternative other than to be flexible. \u201cThere is no Australian challenger, however there are a lot of Australians in the teams. Ironically out of the six teams \u2013 there are three Australian skippers and even more personnel manning the boats on and off the water,\u201d says the Sydney born Spithill, a world champion sailor for Australia and, for Team USA, a two-time America\u2019s Cup conqueror and the youngest ever America\u2019s Cup winning skipper. \u201cProbably a lot of people think back to 1983 and when Australia II Won. The next memory is Alan Bond going to jail and then followed by that is our boat, One Australia, sinking.\u201d The oldest sporting trophy in the world, the Auld Mug, is also perhaps the most tightly held. Since the first edition in 1851 only four nations can lay claim to having captured the silverware: the US, Australia, Switzerland and New Zealand. Australia famously shattered the stranglehold of the USA but since then support for another \u201cboxing kangaroo\u201d styled entrant has dwindled. Since the halcyon days there\u2019s been a dip in public and corporate support for an Australian tilt. That has dented the hopes of homegrown talent. \u201cThe America\u2019s Cup hasn\u2019t been in the spotlight for a long time because Australia hasn\u2019t had a team. This is the pinnacle of sailing. It is the Formula 1 of sailing. We are in the fastest boats of our sport and we are on the cutting edge,\u201d says Tom Slingsby, yet another Aussie and the Oracle Team USA tactician. A proud Sydney sailing graduate, Slingsby has a yachting pedigree that is the envy of all six of the international teams competing in Bermuda. A Sydney to Hobart victor, a World and Olympic champion and a former America\u2019s Cup winner \u2013 the 32-year old dreams of one day being able to race for an entry bearing the flag of his country of birth. \u201cI would love to compete for Australia in the America\u2019s Cup. If anyone was curious about could we win the Americas Cup, you just have to look through these teams. They are littered with sailors from Australia,\u201d Slingsby says. With global powerhouse companies such as BMW, Panerai and Airbus investing millions of dollars in sponsorship and engineering expertise to keep the international teams at the forefront, Slingsby fears it might be hard for Australian players to match the corporate outlay. Although he is less worried about the crewing talent who he insists are more than capable of propelling lesser-funded teams to the top. \u201cWe have to get an Australian team somehow, and we are working through trying to find ways to do that. When we do, we will win this thing eventually,\u201d believes Slingsby. Australia did have a flutter of hope with an entry for this edition of the cup, a team championed by the Hamilton Island Yacht Club. The backers of Sydney to Hobart champion Wild Oats XI submitted a contender before financial pressures forced the syndicate to withdraw their bid in 2014. By many measures Oracle Team USA will be Australia\u2019s unofficial entrant. Regatta rules stipulate only a quarter of the crew have to hail from the country where the yacht is registered, and of the six crew on board the star spangled banner\u2019s entrant the skipper, tactician and at least one grinder will be from Australia. One of those likely to take on the powering duties for the foiling wing sailed catamaran is Ky Hurst, a former ironman and Olympic marathon swimmer. A sailing rookie by his own account the transitioning athlete and new father \u2013 his daughter Juliette was born less than three weeks out from the regatta \u2013 has made a huge impact to the defending champions quest for a third straight Auld Mug. \u201cI was really nervous to come from an individual sport to a team environment but the team has made the transition comfortable for me from day one,\u201d shares Hurst, \u201cThey\u2019ve taught me a lot about sailing, but I\u2019ve taught them a lot about endurance. The boat behind us is a completely different beast. It takes a lot of power and a lot of endurance to get them up and foiling.\u201d Like his countryman aboard the almighty defender Oracle \u2013 nationality comes after winning says Hurst. \u201cWe\u2019ve got one goal in mind and that\u2019s to make sure we keep this Cup. There is not an Australian team, I give it a 110% no matter who I am representing. To do everything I can, to get the best out of myself.\u201d To pretend nationality plays no factor belies the truth. For Australians like Spithill and Slingsby nothing beats defeating the New Zealanders. The Sydney duo did it aboard Oracle in San Francisco four years ago \u2013 winning eight straight races to defend their crown. In 2017 it would seem the Australian connections would love to inflict another defeat on one team more than any other. \u201cI hope we race Team New Zealand in the final again. A lot of people don\u2019t think we should have won the last one. They thought it was a fluke. I am an extremely competitive guy and I want to prove to everyone that we are the better team. So let\u2019s have a rematch,\u201d says Slingsby."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
