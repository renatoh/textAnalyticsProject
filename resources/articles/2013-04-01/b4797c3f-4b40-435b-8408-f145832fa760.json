The FBI announced Tuesday afternoon that investigators have recovered crime scene evidence including \"pieces of black nylon, which could be from a backpack, and fragments of BBs and nails possibly contained in a pressure cooker device.\" The evidence is being shipped to an FBI lab in Quantico for analysis. \u2022 Authorities called for tips from anyone who witnessed a person carrying a dark, unusually heavy bag in the vicinity of the bombing. In addition they asked the public to report anyone who had been talking about a pressure-cooker bomb or \"the marathon, or about the date of April 15 in any way.\" \"Someone knows who did this,\" FBI agent Rick DesLauriers said. \u2022 President Obama will attend an interfaith prayer service in Boston Thursday morning, the Massachusetts governor announced. The president has canceled a trip he was to take to Kansas on Friday. More than a dozen vigils were planned in Boston for Tuesday and Wednesday. \u2022 Three people were killed in the attack, including Krystle Campbell, 29, and Martin Richard, 8. The third fatality is believed to have been a graduate student at Boston University. The school confirmed the death but did not name the victim \"pending permission to do so from the family.\" At least 176 people were wounded in the attack. An unknown number remain in critical condition. Other patients showed improvement. \u2022 No suspects have been identified and no motive has been determined in the marathon bombing, authorities said. \u2022 The city of Boston has established a fund, called One Boston, to provide for victims of the attack and their families. Boston University has announced that a graduate student at the school was among those killed in the marathon attack. A notice on the school web site does not name the student, \"pending permission to do so from the family.\" The notice reads in part: One of the victims killed by blasts at the Boston Marathon on Monday has been identified as a Boston University graduate student. The student\u2019s name has not been released, pending permission to do so from the family. The student was one of three friends who watched the race near the finish line. Another of the three students, also a BU grad student, was injured and is in stable condition at Boston Medical Center. Robert Hill, dean of Marsh Chapel, visited the injured student Monday evening and again yesterday afternoon. He reports that she underwent surgery on Monday and on Tuesday. \u201cShe is doing well,\u201d says Hill. \u201cShe has her friends around her, and she will soon have family around her.\u201d The third BU student was unharmed. (via) Michael Crowley delivers \"A short recent history of pressure cooker bombs\" in Time Magazine: As it happens, pressure cookers have a nefarious reputation in counterterrorism circles. In 2004, the Department of Homeland Security was concerned enough about pressure cooker bombs to issue an alert to federal and state security officials: \u201cA technique commonly taught in Afghan terrorist training camps is the use/conversion of pressure cookers into IEDs,\u201d the bulletin warned. That bulletin cited several plots from 2002 to 2004 to use pressure cooker bombs in France, India and Nepal. But more recently there have been at least three other instances of would-be terrorists in the west, all of them Islamic radicals, in possession of pressure cookers for reasons that seemed not to involve having friends over for dinner ... But it\u2019s important to bear in mind that the ability to make these bombs is hardly unique to al Qaeda and its sympathizers. Members of at least one prominent white supremacist website have shared terror tips from Inspire [a radical Islamic magazine] which one called \u201chighly recommended reading.\u201d Pressure cooker bombs are also discussed in detail on this anarchist site, which describes how to build what is \u201caffectionately known as a HELLHOUND.\u201d Read the full piece here. DesLauriers goes on to explain why the FBI is interested in pressure cookers. Pressure cookers \u2013 they're relatively ordinary cooking devices. As far as precisely what evidence was found \u2013 there are multiple pieces of evidence at the crime scene. That analysis is ongoing right now. What could possibly be a pressure cooker was found at the site, and we're putting that out to the public to possibly generate any leads. Davis says this year's race had a stronger security presence than usual: We review each one of these events. At the end of our review last year, we determined that the crowds were larger than usual. And so we put additional officers at the end of the race,\" the police commissioner says. There was no specific threat about this event ... this was a standard threat picture. Davis says undercover officers were \"fully deployed\" among the crowd as were bomb-sniffing dogs. DesLauriers declines to address a question about a circuit board reportedly found around the attack site. \"That was brought up by a member of the media, not by me,\" the FBI agent says. He's asked about the third, as-yet unidentified fatality. \"There has not been enough work done to make a notification to the next of kin on the third victim,\" DesLauriers says. Governor Deval Patrick says next year's marathon will be\"bigger and better\". Then the police commissioner describes work at the crime scene. \"They are literally going over the crime scene with a fine-toothed comb,\" Davis says. \"This has to be a methodical investigation.\" FBI agent Rick DesLauriers is asked to describe the bombs further, but he demurs. He says there was \"possibly a pressure cooker\" and \"black nylon bags possibly at both sites.\" \"The would not have been light bags,\" he says. The conference is open to questions and police commissioner Ed Davis is asked about what security measures were in place to protect the marathon. \"This is a soft target. And so anybody can go into a church and do this type of thing,\" Davis says. \"You can't lock it down like a military target. It needs to be open to the public. \"The type of the event this is, it can't be turned into a police state.\" Boston Mayor Menino says the city is starting a #oneBoston fund for relief for victims of the bombings. Governor Patrick thanks \"initial donors\" to the fund. Patrick says there \"is a need for blood on a sustained basis... Do not go and make a donation today. But next week and the week after that there will be an ongoing need.\" Patrick announces that President Obama will attend an interfaith service at 11am Thursday morning at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross on the south end. \"This community will recover and heal if we turn to each other rather than on each other,\" Patrick says. DesLauriers says \"around the world\" the force of the United States is working hard to catch the culprits. He says the FBI has received more than 2,000 tips. \"Regarding who might be suspected, the investigation is in its infancy,\" he says. \"At this time there are no claims of responsibility. The range of suspects and motives remains wide open.\" He says that whoever did this has friends or family who know about it. \"We're asking anyone who may have heard someone speak about the marathon, or about the date of April 15 in any way, to call us.\" DesLauriers adds: \"Someone knows who did this.\" He asks business to preserve any surveillance video in \"original form.\" DesLauriers urges anyone to come forward if they observed or heard of anyone researching bombmaking, or heard noises of explosions in remote areas. He also encourages anyone to step forward who saw \"someone who appeared to be carrying an unusually dark, heavy bag yesterday in the vicinity of the blasts.\" FBI agent Richard DesLauriers begins with a recap of their efforts so far. He said the first task was to secure the scene. Then a task force of more than 30 agencies responded to the scene to begin an investigation. The first step was to secure the physical area, he said. This morning the teams officially began a forensic recovery effort. Those items have been recovered and are being sent to a special facility at FBI headquarters in Quantico, he says. Among the items recovered were \"pieces of black nylon which could be from a backpack and fragments of BBs and nails possibly contained in a pressure cooker device. \"The bag would have been heavy because of the components believed to be in it. \"We won't know with certainty until the laboratory completes its final review.\" The FBI, police and city authorities in Boston are giving an update on the investigation now. Thomas Grilk, director of the Boston Athletic Association, has released a statement on Facebook declaring the group's commitment to staging the marathon next year. The statement reads in part: The Boston Athletic Association (B.A.A.) extends its deepest sympathies to all those who were affected by Monday's tragic events. Those who lost their lives and were injured are in our thoughts and prayers. ... We would like to thank the countless people from around the world who have reached out to support us over the last 24 hours.... Boston is strong. Boston is resilient. Boston is our home. And Boston has made us enormously proud in the past 24 hours. The Boston Marathon is a deeply held tradition \u2013 an integral part of the fabric and history of our community. We are committed to continuing that tradition with the running of the 118th Boston Marathon in 2014. (via @AntDeRosa) A rivalry momentarily set aside: Dr. Tracey Dechert of the Boston Medical Center trauma department is now delivering an update outside the center. She says seven patients are still in critical condition at the center, six are in serious condition and six are in fair. Three patients have moved out of critical condition in the last 24 hours, she says. Nine patients are scheduled to receive further operations Wednesday. She gives a different account of the shrapnel than Dr. Velmahos at Mass General: \"Several patients had fragments removed... and the evidence is handled the same way every time,\" Dechert says. \"We've been removing various things from people... We have not seen nails. We have not seen ball bearings. Particles of metal and plastic. That's what we're seeing in our patients.\" She said the center admitted one runner, but not in critical condition. \"All the critical people were spectators.\" The UK Foreign Office advises that consular officials \"are following-up reports that a British National has been injured in the [bombing] and stand ready to offer consular assistance.\" No further details were available. The office says it is in close contact with the local authorities in Boston. Boston's WCVB reports that in a hospital mixup, the parents of Krystle Campbell, who died in the bombing, were initially told she'd survived: \u201cI said, \u2018That\u2019s not my daughter, that\u2019s Karen! Where\u2019s my daughter?\u2019\" Patty Campbell said. Full story here. (via) Among the security and medical personnel at the marathon Monday were National Guard troops trained to respond to a biological or chemical attack, Foreign Policy reports, pointing up just how robust the security presence is for such events: CSTs, as they are known, are National Guard units that are specially trained and equipped to detect and respond to chemical, biological, or radiological incidents. Basically, they're the first people a governor would call in the event of a WMD attack. These teams were on hand before the marathon even started, according to New York Guard spokesman Eric Durr, who says that such teams are deployed before most major events where public officials worry about the threat of a WMD attack. \"If a bomb goes off, they can check out the scene and determine whether or not there's any other contaminants besides the explosive,\" said Durr. \"They come with a full suite of detection gear, communications equipment, and we generally deploy them in teams of two or three vehicles. Of course they're onsite anytime there's a major public event\" such as the opening of the UN General Assembly, the Masters Tournament, or NASCAR race. A rare demonstration of goodwill, one baseball club to another: Law enforcement officials have scheduled a news conference to begin in one hour, at 5pm ET. A memorial vigil has been planned for Boston Common Tuesday evening from 6-8pm. The gathering will be held near the Parkman Bandstand, less than a mile from the bombing site. The Boston Globe has compiled a list of about a dozen other vigils planned in the Boston area for Tuesday, and additional vigils Wednesday. The Guardian's Ed Pilkington is in Boston, where he picks up on a \"bit of good news to emerge from the grisliness.\" Ed notes that Dr. George Velmahos, the chief trauma surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital, said \"some critical patients have woken up and others are stabilizing\": Guardian defence and security correspondent Nick Hopkins writes that investigators are now seeking to exploit the \u2018golden hour\u2019 after an incident \u2013 \"the period in which they can gather the best forensic evidence to help them catch a criminal, or identify the leads that will help them to do so\": In Boston, there should be rich seams for them to mine, even if it takes time. There will be CCTV coverage, debris from the explosives, and eyewitness accounts. At the same time, they will be reviewing the intelligence they had prior to the attack across the domestic and international agencies to see if any \u2018flags\u2019 were missed. But beyond the evidence gathering, investigators will ask whether the modus operandi fits any particular group, or suggests one theory as more likely than another. In an information vacuum, such speculation might seem unwise for the media, but this is exactly the process the FBI will be going through as it seeks to narrow the boundaries of the inquiry. For more on how the FBI is likely to pursue the case see Richard Clarke's Facebook post here. Both US law enforcement and Saudi embassy officials say a Saudi student who was interviewed by police and who let them search his apartment is not a suspect in the attack. \u201cHe volunteered to have [his apartment] searched,\u201d an unnamed Saudi official told the Washington Post. \u201cHe is fully cooperating with authorities.\u201d This morning the Guardian's Adam Gabbatt reported that police officers quizzed two male Saudi Arabian students at Ocean Shores Tower in the Revere neighborhood of Boston. Dr. George Velmahos, chief of trauma surgery at Massachusetts General surgeon, is holding a news conference with Dr. Alasdair Conn, head of the emergency room. Velmahos says the remaining \"critically ill\" patients will hopefully come out of intensive care \"in a few days.\" Surgery at the hospital on bombing victims is ongoing, Velmahos says. He says he's amazed at the strength of the patients. All the amputations were above the knee, he says, \"because the leg was destroyed below the knee.\" The hospital says many people came to donate blood and the facility has a surplus for the moment. The hospital may need more blood in the future, Conn advises. Meanwhile the father of a man who was photographed being pushed away from the bombing in a wheelchair says his son has had both legs amputated, the AP reports. Jeff Bauman says his son, 27-year-old Jeff Bauman Jr., is the man in an Associated Press photo taken shortly after the bombing. Here is a cropped version of the photo, which shows Carlos Arredondo attending the victim: The AP reports: His father says on his Facebook page that his son had to have both lower limbs removed at Boston Medical Center because of extensive vascular and bone damage. He says his son also had to have another surgery because of fluid in his abdomen. Bauman says his son was there to watch his girlfriend run. She was not hurt. He says his son was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Esquire publishes an account by Tyler Dodd, a bystander with medical training who ran toward the explosions and ended up working in the middle of the improvised triage center. He describes a scene of blood and confusion: It was pure chaos immediately following. There were people screaming, a lot of people with lower extremity injuries, and a lot of blood. At first there seemed to be a lot of confusion on which patients needed to receive treatment first. There seemed to be a bunch of young nursing students and younger medical personnel that didn't have a lot of experience. The patients that were screaming were getting the attention first, when in reality it's usually the people that are not screaming that need the attention most. I was handed a bag of triage tags. The tags help us know who is level 1, 2 or 3 \u2014 who's priority. I stuck right with the doctor the whole time and did exactly what he asked me to do. At one point I was asked to leave the tent by Boston EMS because I was not in uniform and didn't have any credentials. The doctor said, \"No, this guy's not going anywhere.\" Read the full piece here. The president is briefed Tuesday by FBI director Robert Mueller, foreground, and others: President Barack Obama receives an update on the explosions that occurred in Boston, in the Oval Office, April 16, 2013. Seated, from left, are: Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano; Tony Blinken, Deputy National Security Advisor; Jake Sullivan, National Security Advisor to the Vice President; Attorney General Eric Holder; Lisa Monaco, Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism; Chief of Staff Denis McDonough; and FBI Director Robert Mueller. (Official White House Photo by Pete Souza) The National Review notes that Monaco, the counter-terror adviser, has held her current position for only a month, having replaced John Brennan after he took over as director of the CIA: Obama\u2019s response, partly, is Monaco\u2019s responsibility. And both components\u2014investigating the incident and eventually prosecuting the culprit\u2014speak to her history at the Justice Department and FBI. While she\u2019s a relative newcomer to this particular role, Monaco is no stranger to stressful, high-profile jobs: As assistant attorney general for national security, she oversaw Justice\u2019s national security division since 2011 after moving up the ranks there. She and Mueller have worked closely together before: The University of Chicago Law School graduate was his former counsel and chief of staff. She initially joined the FBI on detail from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia. Full piece here. The Boston Globe has identified a second victim of the marathon bombings as Krystle Campbell, 29, of Arlington, Massachusetts, a northwestern Boston suburb. The Globe reports: She went to watch the Marathon every year and was there with a friend this year. The friend is hospitalized with serious injuries. The third person killed in the attack has not been publicly identified. Boston native Richard Clarke, the former national coordinator for counter-terrorism, has posted an 850-word piece on Facebook entitled \"How they will investigate the Boston bombing\": While detectives and federal agents have started the laborious process of interviewing thousands of people in Boston, much of the work that is likely to be key to solving the Boston Bombing is technical and forensic. First, the FBI will stitch together hundreds of hours of video camera recordings from private and public surveillance and traffic cameras, as well as recordings made by private citizens attending the race. They will look for when the bombs might have been left behind and then examine the faces of everyone who was in the area around that time.... Second, FBI and NSA will look at phone records. If the bombs were command detonated using mobile phones to trigger the blast, it may be possible to find out what phone numbers were used by seeing what numbers were called on that block or in that neighborhood at exactly the time of the blasts.... Third, FBI (perhaps with help from ATF) will try to reassemble the bombs by gathering as many tiny fragments of material as possible., as they did in the case of the bombing of Pan Am 103 and Oklahoma City.... Fourth, Homeland Security investigators will examine who flew out of Boston, especially to foreign locations, around the time of the bombing. In the 1993 World Trade Center attack and the CIA Headquarters-Route 123 shootings, attackers moved quickly to the airport to get out of the country.... Fifth, police and federal agents will contact all of their informants in Islamist cells and American Right Wing and Aryan Supremacist groups. They will offer rewards for leads, for suspicions.... Read the full piece here. (via) Charles P Pierce, a veteran of many marathons as a sometimes disgruntled spectator, writes in Grantland about the meaning of the race to Boston: Nobody loves the Boston Marathon as much as the people who make fun of it year after year. This was the race that previously offered as a prize a not particularly expensive medal, a laurel wreath, and a bowl of beef stew. This was the race that, on one memorable occasion, nobody knew who actually won. I don't know anyone who loved the race that didn't mock it for its monumental inconvenience, its occasionally towering self-regard, and the annual attempts by Boston-area television stations to use it to win another shelf full of local Emmys. This includes me, and I've been around 25 or 30 of them, more or less, in one way or another, watching from the press truck, from the firehouse in Newton, from somebody's roof, and very often from just barely inside the front door of the late, lamented Eliot Lounge. The Marathon was the old, drunk uncle of Boston sports, the last of the true festival events. Every other one of our major sporting rodeos is locked down, and tightened up, and Fail-Safed until the Super Bowl now is little more than NORAD with bad rock music and offensive tackles. You can't do that to the Marathon. There was no way to do it. There was no way to lock down, or tighten up, or Fail-Safe into Security Theater a race that covers 26.2 miles, a race that travels from town to town, a race that travels past people's houses. There was no way to garrison the Boston Marathon. Now there will be. Someone will find a way to do it. And I do not know what the race will be now. I literally haven't the vaguest clue. Full piece here. The Guardian's Peter Walker has the story of Carlos Arredondo, a spectator who flew into action after the bombs went off: The 52-year-old Costa Rican immigrant is visible in a series of photos and videos taken immediately after the twin blasts near the race finish line. The distinctive, long-haired figure sprints across the street to tear away fencing and scaffolding to get to victims. Reports said he used his own clothes and towels to try to staunch bleeding. Arredondo was reportedly waiting at the finish to greet a runner who was competing in the race in memory of his son, Alexander Arredondo, a lance corporal in the US marines who was killed by a sniper in 2004 in Iraq. Read the full story here. The London marathon will observe multiple periods of silence to acknowledge the Boston tragedy, organizers have announced: There will be a period of silence lasting 30 seconds prior to the start of the elite men\u2019s race and mass start at this Sunday\u2019s race to mark the tragic events that have unfolded in Boston in the last 24 hours. This period of silence will be observed on all three London Marathon starts (red, blue and green) and will be signalled by a whistle at both the start and finish of the 30 seconds. In addition black ribbons will be distributed to all runners to wear, organizers said. Bill Richard, father of Martin Richard, the 8-year-old killed in the attack, has issued a statement: My dear son Martin has died from injuries sustained in the attack on Boston. My wife and daughter are both recovering from serious injuries. We thank our family and friends, those we know and those we have never met, for their thoughts and prayers. I ask that you continue to pray for my family as we remember Martin. We also ask for your patience and for your privacy as we work to simultaneously grieve and recover. Thank you. Here's a summary of where things stand: \u2022 A double bombing near the finish line of the Boston marathon Monday killed three and wounded 176. Among the dead was an 8-year-old boy, Martin Richard, who was at the finish line with his family. \u2022 Limb amputations were performed on four patients at Massachusetts General Hospital and other patients had limbs at risk, a trauma surgeon said. At least five patients remained in critical condition at another hospital. At Boston Children's Hospital, a nine-year-old girl had a leg amputated and a boy had \"deep shrapnel wounds\" and was in critical condition. \u2022 Doctors said patients had been hit by shrapnel of consistent size and shape, variously described as \"pellets\" and \"nails.\" A surgeon at Massachusetts General hospital said some patients were hit by dozens of pieces of shrapnel, which he said had apparently been built into the bombs. \u2022 President Obama called the attack an \"act of terror,\" but said the culprit or culprits are unknown and authorities had no sense of motive. \"What we don\u2019t yet know, however,\" he said, \"is who carried out this attack, or why; whether it was planned and executed by a terrorist organization, foreign or domestic, or was the act of a malevolent individual.\" The president said authorities would bring those responsible to justice. He ordered flags to be flown at half staff. \u2022 Authorities sent out a call for photographs and video from marathon day, especially from the area of the attack. A large-scale investigation led by the FBI unfolded in Boston, where a 12-block-area around the marathon finish remained cordoned off as a crime scene. Authorities told residents to expect a heavy police presence and possibly to be stopped for questioning. Officials would not comment on what evidence or leads they might have. The police commissioner said \"no-one's in custody.\" \u2022 With authorities and citizens on heightened alert, at least two airports experienced false alarms leading to evacuations. A plane was evacuated on the tarmac at Boston Logan and a terminal was evacuated at New York LaGuardia. Travel later resumed as normal. Boston.com is compiling a list of ways for people to help out. They include: Boston Police Help Line: Family or friends looking for info about people injured in the blasts can call (617) 635-4500. A Google doc called \"Caring for the Richard family\" has been circulating online asking for donations for the Richard family. Here's the transcript of the president's statement this morning: THE PRESIDENT: Good morning, everybody. I've just been briefed by my national security team, including FBI Director Mueller, Attorney General Holder, Secretary Napolitano, and my Counterterrorism and Homeland Security Advisor Lisa Monaco, on the attacks in Boston. We continue to mobilize and deploy all appropriate law enforcement resources to protect our citizens, and to investigate and to respond to this attack. Obviously our first thoughts this morning are with the victims, their families, and the city of Boston. We know that two explosions gravely wounded dozens of Americans, and took the lives of others, including a 8-year-old boy. This was a heinous and cowardly act. And given what we now know about what took place, the FBI is investigating it as an act of terrorism. Any time bombs are used to target innocent civilians it is an act of terror. What we don\u2019t yet know, however, is who carried out this attack, or why; whether it was planned and executed by a terrorist organization, foreign or domestic, or was the act of a malevolent individual. That's what we don't yet know. And clearly, we\u2019re at the beginning of our investigation. It will take time to follow every lead and determine what happened. But we will find out. We will find whoever harmed our citizens and we will bring them to justice. We also know this -- the American people refuse to be terrorized. Because what the world saw yesterday in the aftermath of the explosions were stories of heroism and kindness, and generosity and love: Exhausted runners who kept running to the nearest hospital to give blood, and those who stayed to tend to the wounded, some tearing off their own clothes to make tourniquets. The first responders who ran into the chaos to save lives. The men and women who are still treating the wounded at some of the best hospitals in the world, and the medical students who hurried to help, saying \u201cWhen we heard, we all came in.\u201d The priests who opened their churches and ministered to the hurt and the fearful. And the good people of Boston who opened their homes to the victims of this attack and those shaken by it. So if you want to know who we are, what America is, how we respond to evil -- that\u2019s it. Selflessly. Compassionately. Unafraid. In the coming days, we will pursue every effort to get to the bottom of what happened. And we will continue to remain vigilant. I\u2019ve directed my administration to take appropriate security measures to protect the American people. And this is a good time for all of us to remember that we all have a part to play in alerting authorities -- if you see something suspicious, speak up. I have extraordinary confidence in the men and women of the FBI, the Boston Police Department, and the other agencies that responded so heroically and effectively in the aftermath of yesterday\u2019s events. I\u2019m very grateful for the leadership of Governor Patrick and Mayor Menino. And I know that even as we protect our people and aggressively pursue this investigation, the people of Boston will continue to respond in the same proud and heroic way that they have thus far -- and their fellow Americans will be right there with them. Thank you very much. And you can expect further briefings from our law enforcement officials as the day goes on. When we have more details, they will be disclosed. What I\u2019ve indicated to you is what we know now. We know it was bombs that were set off. We know that obviously they did some severe damage. We do not know who did them. We do not know whether this was an act of an organization or an individual or individuals. We don\u2019t have a sense of motive yet. So everything else at this point is speculation. But as we receive more information, as the FBI has more information, as our out counterterrorism teams have more information, we will make sure to keep you and the American people posted. Thank you very much, everybody. The Boston Globe has an update on the youngest victims of the bombings: The victims of the Boston Marathon bombings include a 9-year-old girl who lost a leg and a 10-year-old boy who suffered deep shrapnel wounds to his legs, according to the director of the trauma program at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital. The most seriously injured children had BBs and nails embedded in their bodies, said Dr. David P. Mooney -- objects that were apparently packed into the explosive devices. The 9- and 10-year-olds are in critical condition but are expected to survive. They will need multiple surgeries to recover from their devastating injuries, Mooney said in an interview with the Globe Tuesday morning. Read the full piece here. A patient at Tufts Medical Center in Boston, Nicholas Yanni, 32, (photo) is describing a scene of chaos after the bombing. He suffered a \"pierced eardrum,\" he says. He says he was about 10 feet from one of the bombs. His wife, Lee Ann Yanni, 31, \"had shrapnel that went through her lower left leg and I think it shattered her fibula... she's got to go in for surgery again tomorrow.\" Yanni said he was separated from his wife at first, and had to \"sneak around the back side, where the church is.\" He entered a medical tent and saw his wife about to be transported from the scene. I yelled, that's my wife, can I please go with her? And I got in the ambulance. She was cool as a cucumber. In my mind I'm trying to be calm for her but I'm freaking out. I was in shock, to realize what had happened, and it could have been so much worse for us. My hearing was really bad... a lot of muffled, ringing sounds. I was very fortunate. There are a lot of people who have lost their lives, or who have lost limbs. Boston Logan airport releases a statement saying that suspect luggage has been deemed \"harmless\" after the earlier evacuation of US Airways flight 1716: Please note: Out of an abundance of caution a US Airways flight was remotely parked at the airfield while a bag on board was examined. The passengers were bused to the terminal, the baggage was deemed harmless, and the flight taxied to the gate. Airport operations were not impacted. Thank you. Adam Gabbatt is in Dorchester, the Boston district that was home to Martin Richard, the eight-year-old who died yesterday. He has spoken to a senior staff member at the boy's kindergarten. Russ Wilson, regional director at the Pope John Paul II Catholic Academy in Dorchester, told the Guardian: \"He was just a great little kid. Always a smile, loving, caring, great enthusiasm for school, for learning, a very thoughtful little boy.\" Martin Richard attended the school between ages four and five, leaving in June 2010, Wilson said. His older brother Henry also went to Pope John Paul II. \"It's a tragedy. An absolute tragedy,\" Wilson said. He said the Richards were a \"beautiful family\". Guardian US social news editor Katie Rogers and community coordinator Ruth Spencer are rounding up stories from readers who were on the ground in Boston, talking about what happened and the importance of Marathon Monday to the community. Here's a selection: Garrett Quinn: Marathon Monday is one of the biggest party days of the year in Boston, and most of those parties often have nothing to do with what the holiday commemorates, the battles of Lexington and Concord. It's often a school vacation week, too. Even those without kids skip town because of the disruption caused by the marathon can be too much. Going forward, though, the holiday will likely have a different meaning as the tragic events of yesterday have left a permanent mark on the day's marquee event. Guardian commenter Paul Nicholson (PaulNich): The Boston Marathon is one of those amazing events that is full of goodness and happiness. I run every year because it is one of the most wonderful experiences I ever have. I run (which is my sport) and I help raise money for a great cause. I simply can't believe how the day ended and my heart goes out to the victims. Full roundup is here. The president says that investigators do not have any sense of motive for the attacks. We know it was bombs that were set off. We know that obviously they did some severe damage. We do not know who whether it was an organization, an individual or individuals, we don't have a sense of motive yet. Earlier the president called on people to look for threats. \"This is a good time to remember that we all have a part to play... If you see something suspicious, speak up.\" Obama says there will be further briefings from law enforcement individuals as the day goes on. He does not take questions. Barack Obama is speaking from the White House and says he has just been briefed on the attacks in Boston. \"Obviously our first thoughts this morning are with the victims and their families,\" he says. We know this was a heinous and cowardly act, and given what we now know, the FBI is now investigating it as an act of terror. What we don't yet know is who carried out this for or why, whether it was planned and carried out by a terrorist organization, foreign or domestic ... or a malevolent individual. The president says that investigators will find out who carried out the attacks. \"We will find out who harmed our citizens. We know this: The American citizens refuse to be terrorized.\" Obama mentions examples of aid provided under duress: runners that finished the course and then ran to hospitals to give blood. people who ripped of their clothes to make tourniquets. \"If you want to know who we are, who America is, how we respond to evil: that's it.\" Paul Owen has been speaking to Professor Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University. Levin, a former New York policeman who as an officer worked the NYC marathon, said that \u201ctrying to glean a motive from the facts that we have is next to impossible\u201d. In the initial stages of something like this, [speculating about who carried it out is] really fraught with error. The Madrid bombings - at first folks were saying it was Eta, and it wasn\u2019t ... Let me give you another example. Columbine was on Hitler\u2019s birthday, but it wasn\u2019t done by neo-Nazis. As for the motive for the attacks, he said that could fall into one of three categories. The first one is the ideological motive \u2013 it can be religious, political or both. The second is the psychologically dangerous: it could be someone with a cognitive impairment ... or it could be someone who\u2019s a sociopath, but not both. The third is personal benefit or revenge. Maybe there was someone who had something happen to them with the city of Boston or the marathon or something like that. Levin said that the biggest terrorist threats in the US today were from anti-government militants, white supremacists, and Salafist jihadists. But he said the case would not be broken by a terrorism analyst who used to be a policeman. Instead it would be: \u201cSomeone has a picture of a guy near a garbage can and then someone else has a picture of him with a backpack \u2013 that\u2019s what they\u2019re going to be looking for \u2013 piece all that together and that\u2019s how the case gets broken.\u201d The president's former senior adviser, grounded: President Obama is expected to speak from the White House in 5-10 minutes. Organizers of the London marathon are making plans to \"show our respect for the events that unfolded in Boston.\" The Guardian's Adam Vaughan, who plans to run the marathon, has just received a communique sent out to all athletes. It reads in part: We have reviewed and will continue to review our security arrangements with the Metropolitan Police and other authorities. We are being fully supported in all aspects of the event to safeguard our runners, spectators, volunteers and everyone connected with the event. [...] Further information will be forthcoming by Wednesday morning on how we propose to show our respect for the events that unfolded in Boston in the last 24 hours. Adam notes that there has been some talk on the marathon Facebook page of runners wearing black armbands, or of there being a minute's silence. US Airways flight 1716 from Philadelphia has been evacuated on the tarmac upon arrival at Boston Logan airport. (See UPDATE below) It's not clear what prompted the evacuation. Meanwhile a terminal at LaGuardia Airport in New York City has been evacuated due to a suspicious package, Bloomberg reports. UPDATE: Boston Logan says suspect luggage from evacuated flight found to be \"harmless\" As flags at public buildings including the White House are lowered to half-staff, President Obama has released a proclamation \"honoring the victims of the tragedy\". It reads: As a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of violence perpetrated on April 15, 2013, in Boston, Massachusetts, by the authority vested in me as President of the United States by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby order that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff at the White House and upon all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions until sunset, April 20, 2013. I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same length of time at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations. We're following a news conference at Brigham and Women's hospital. The surgeon says the hospital received 31 patients, of which 15 \"were admitted\" and 9 were operated upon. Five remain in a critical condition, he says. As with his counterpart at Massachusetts General, he reports many of the injured have shrapnel wounds. \"Some of the shrapnel injuries are actually pretty minor,\" he says. \"The patients who have non-shrapnel related injuries predominantly have fractures\" and areas of skin removed by the blast, he adds. The flag over the White House is about to be lowered to half-staff, ABC reports. From a journalist with WBZ-TV in Boston: The AP quotes the defense secretary: The Massachusetts General surgeon, identified now as George Velmahos, chief of trauma surgery, says the shrapnel in the patients were consistent in size, include nail-like fragments and \"my feeling is that most of [the metallic fragments in patients] were in the bomb.\" Velmahos says: \"There were people who had 10, 20, 30 of them in their body.\" The surgeon says he believes the patients were spectators. \"I don't think any of them were runners. I think that they were all spectators.\" Velmahos says most patients are still intubated and unable to talk. He says the first patients may be released in a few days, but it's too early to predict. The doctor said the four separate patients who have received amputations were \"automatic\" cases. \"Almost all of them had such severe trauma in their lower section... I would consider them almost automatic amputees. We just completed what the bomb had done.\" A surgeon is speaking outside Massachusetts General Hospital. \"Eight patients are in more severe conditions than the rest,\" he says. \"We're very pleased with the results,\" despite the serious surgery. \"Unfortunately [there are] amputations because of the devastating effect of the bombs. Most of them have severe wounds to the lower extremities ... related to the blast effect as well as small metallic fragments \u2013 shrapnel\". He says the bombs appeared to have contained \"multiple metallic fragments\". The surgeon says four amputations have been performed. He says there are two more limbs at risk but he is hopeful that they could be saved. Patients at Massachusetts general range in age from 28 to 71, he says. Patients are also being treated at a separate children's hospital and elsewhere. He says the devices seem to have been placed low on the ground, and therefore injuries to the lower extremities are to be expected. \"Most of the patients are conscious, but we do have patients that are medically sedated.\" he says. FBI special agent Rick DesLauriers says agents are interviewing a \"variety of witnesses\" at multiple locations. Mayor Menino closes the conference with an appeal for cooperation from the public. \"This is a resilient city, and we're gonna get by this,\" he says. \"One incident will not knock the city's history.\" Police commissioner Ed Davis is asked about a bomb placed in a trash can. \"There's no evidence of that,\" he says. Davis said there were two sweeps for explosives before the bombing, one in the early morning and one just before the lead runners came through. Those sweeps turned up nothing, he said, but because there's unrestricted access to the course someone could have planted a device later. Davis gives a new, higher number for casualties, saying that local hospitals took 176 injured people. He said that 17 people were in a critical condition and that three people were confirmed dead. He adds: \"No-one's in custody.\" The news conference moves on to questions. A journalist asks what the authorities know about the devices, and whether the source was domestic or international The FBI special agent in charge, Rick DesLauriers, says: \"I can't comment on that aspect... there is no known imminent physical threat at any location where we might be conducting investigative activity.\" There is a question about the nature of the device. \"I'm not going to be able to comment about the nature of the device.\" Asked about who might be in custody, he replies: \"I'm not going to say who might or might not be in custody right now.\" There is a question about surveillance cameras in the area. Police commissioner Ed Davis replies: \"It's a basic investigative protocol to secure all the video. Even as we were removing victims officers were assigned .... to secure those videos. \"There is a large number of them. \"It's our intention to go through every frame of every video we have. This was probably one of the most photographed areas in the country yesterday.\" The superintendent of Massachusetts state police, Timothy Alben, says the public can expect to see a lot more police \"over the next days and probably longer\". He reiterates what has become an emphatic call from authorities for people to submit documentation of the scene. \"There has to be hundreds if not thousands of photographs and videos,\" he says. \"I would encourage you to bring forward anything. You might not think it's significant.\" Police commissioner Ed Davis is next to speak. \"We are in the process of securing and processing the most complex crime scene we've dealt with in the history of our department,\" he says. He says New York City and Baltimore police units have responded to the scene in Boston. The 15-block crime scene has been reduced to about 12 blocks, he says, \"and we will continue to collapse that crime scene,\" but he urges patience. Davis says the crime scene will be active for at least two days. He asks for any photographs or videos from \"not just at that scene\" but anywhere. Gene Marquez, of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, asks people to call a hotline and send any photographs or video they have of the bombing. \u2022 The hotline for witnesses who may have information is 800-CALL-FBI, 800-225-5324 \u2022 The number for families of victims is 617-635-4500 The FBI special agent in charge, Rick DesLauriers, comes to the podium. For the first time, he refers to a \"bombing\". He begins by thanking first responders. \"We continue to work shoulder-to-shoulder\" with other agencies to investigate the incident, he says. Our mission is clear: to bring to justice those responsible for the marathon bombing. He says that while the investigation is active, there are \"no additional threats\". DesLauriers says the Copley Square area may be a crime scene for days. Residents of Boston can expect a heavy FBI presence, DesLauriers says. Expect to see agents interviewing \"maybe your neighbor or your co-worker or even yourself in the coming days,\" he says. \"We encourage you to cooperate.\" Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, is next to speak. She says the president had offered his support. \"We didn't have to reach out to him, he reached out to us,\" she says. \"As the mayor says, Boston will survive.\" Boston mayor Tom Menino speaks. \"Yesterday terrorists attacked the city of Boston,\" he says. Menino expresses sympathy for the victims of the blasts. \"We grieve for them. We grieve for the little boy. \"We're gonna make sure the city pulls together... Let's continue to work together.\" Menino says it's \"a very difficult time in our city's history\", and adds: \"This is a tragedy, but Boston's a very strong city.\" Patrick said: It's important to clarify that two and only two explosive devices were found yesterday. Other parcels have been examined... but there were no unexploded bombs. He said that more than 150 people were injured. \"Our hearts go out to their families,\" Patrick said. He thanked first responders for their \"extraordinary work\". Patrick added: Everyone should expect continued, heightened police presence. And everyone should continue to be vigilant. The investigation continues. A briefing led by the FBI and Boston city authorities is beginning in Boston now. The Massachusetts governor, Deval Patrick, opens the briefing by confirming that there were only two explosions, and that there were no unexploded devices. Rudy Giuliani, mayor of New York City during the 9/11 attacks, said in an interview Tuesday morning that it was \"surprising\" there haven't been more terror attacks in the US in the last decade. Authorities have not established the source of the Boston attack, no one has claimed responsibility and police say there are no suspects. \u201cIt\u2019s surprising there haven\u2019t been more of these since September 11th,\u201d Giuliani said on CBS\u2019s \u201cThis Morning.\u201d \u201cWe expected many attacks like this. The really remarkable story is that so many have been prevented. The reality is what we\u2019ve been doing hasn\u2019t worked 100 percent, but it\u2019s worked well. And now we have to learn from this to prevent something like this from happening in the future also.\" The organisers of Sunday's London Marathon have just posted a statement on their Facebook page saying that the event will go ahead as originally scheduled. \"We have reviewed and will continue to review our security arrangements with the Metropolitan police and other authorities,\" a spokesperson writes. We are being fully supported in all aspects of the event to safeguard our runners, spectators, volunteers and everyone connected with the event ... Further information will be forthcoming by Wednesday morning on how we propose to show our respect for the events that unfolded in Boston in the last 24 hours. A comment from Adrian Nobby Clarke underneath the statement summed up the mood of Sunday's runners: \"I will run and I will finish. Let's do it for Boston.\" Tom McCarthy here in New York taking over for Paul Owen in London. Boston Globe columnist Kevin Cullen takes the measure of the city's loss: The marathon is the city's signature event, a tangible link with the rest of the world. It is one of the few things that allows us to cling to that pretense of Boston being the Hub of the universe. Patriots Day is a celebration of our revolutionary history, but we share it with the world. It is the one day of the year when the city is its most diverse, with people from so many other countries here to run those 26 miles from Hopkinton to the Back Bay. And so it was alternately poignant and horrifying to watch as first responders frantically pulled metal barriers and the flags of so many different countries down into Boylston Street in a desperate rush to get to the dead and the injured on the sidewalk. Read the full piece here. The New York Times\u2019s Jess Bidgood posts this photo of people gathering near where the bombs went off. Reuters is reporting that there will be a police press conference at 9.30am local time (2.30pm BST). My colleagues on the Datablog have written a post looking at some of the ways people tried to gain clarity about what happened in Boston on Monday, and assist those seeking help and those providing it. A female Chinese citizen was among at least 140 people injured by explosions at the Boston Marathon on Monday afternoon, China\u2019s state newswire Xinhua reported amid an outpouring of sympathy from the country\u2019s internet users, writes Jonathan Kaiman in Beijing. The Chinese victim - Zhou Danling, a student at Boston University - is comatose and receiving treatment at a local hospital, according to the report. She graduated from Wuhan University in central China and is reading a graduate degree in actuarial science, according to an article on the popular news portal Sina.com. At least 85 people from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan participated in the race, none of them professional runners. On the Facebook page for Sunday\u2019s London Marathon, runners are saying they will wear black armbands in remembrance of Monday\u2019s bombings. Ian Tilley wrote: \u201cWill be wearing a black armband as I run round on Sunday as a mark of respect to all those affected by the tragedy in Boston.\u201d Many called for sponsors Virgin to give out black armbands at the start of the race. I asked Virgin if they were considering this but a spokeswoman said they were not answering specific questions about Sunday\u2019s marathon and would be making a general statement later on their website. Others on the marathon Facebook page called for a minute\u2019s silence for the Boston victims on Sunday. Some runners said they were feeling anxious about running. Claire Davidson wrote: My initial reaction was fear and whether I should take my 5 year old to support me. However this morning I feel that we all HAVE to be there to show solidarity against these cowards. I hope London will be even bigger and better supported than normal as a result. Boston wakes up this morning to a beautiful, cloudless spring day, but a very surreal mood hangs over the Copley Square area that has now been turned into one massive crime scene, Ed Pilkington writes: My hotel is just one block away from Boylston Street and the marathon finish line. As I stepped out of the building this morning there was a hotel worker hoovering the front door mat of the hotel, and behind him the street was lined with armoured vehicles and police cars. The streets are eerily quiet, except for the sound of a police sniffer dog howling. In the square itself, the medical tent, with its Red Cross sign still showing, has been turned into a police investigation room. Large trucks are parked around the square bearing the insignia of the main agencies that have descended on Boston overnight: there is an ATF explosives and fire investigation truck, a Massachusetts state police incident command vehicle and numerous black special ops vans. There are gaggles of police in Swat gear and others in military fatigues on every street corner. The city has indicated the area will remain in lockdown indefinitely as the investigation progresses. Deval Patrick, the governor of Massachusetts, has indicated that security will be heightened across the Boston subway system with random checks planned on passengers and their backpacks. Some of the city\u2019s colleges have announced closures today, and the Boston Celtics have postponed tonight\u2019s basketball fixture against the Indiana Pacers. This map shows the location of Copley Square and the two explosions. Last month the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights group, wrote to US attorney general Eric Holder and Janet Napolitano, the secretary of homeland security, warning of the \u201clooming dangers\u201d and \u201cgrowing threat\u201d of \u201cnon-Islamic domestic terrorism\u201d. In a report, the SPLC said the number of \u201cmilitias and radical antigovernment groups\u201d had grown from 149 in 2008 to 1,360 in 2012. The current moves towards some limited forms of gun control in the US were \u201clikely to swell the ranks of antigovernment groups\u201d, the SPLC said, as similar moves had in the 1990s. The group also said \u201chate groups\u201d opposed to immigration might be inflamed by current moves towards granting citizenship to illegal immigrants, and warned: \u201cThe resources devoted to countering domestic hate and radical antigovernment groups and those they may inspire do not appear commensurate with the threat.\u201d The Boston Globe has named the eight-year-old boy who was killed in the attack yesterday as Martin Richard, who was from the Dorchester area of the city. His mother and sister were also seriously injured in the blasts, the paper writes. The Globe writes: Martin\u2019s father, Bill, is a community leader in the Ashmont section of Dorchester. A third child was reportedly uninjured. \u201cThey are beloved by this community. They contribute in many ways. That\u2019s why you see this outpouring,\u201d said city councilor at large Ayanna Pressley, who was among the mourners. \u201cIt\u2019s surreal, it\u2019s tragic, it\u2019s incomprehensible. Everyone here tonight is trying to comfort one another and be prayerful.\u201d Boston airport and hotels are open as usual after the bombings, and airlines are allowing passengers to reschedule their flights, reports Isabel Choat. The Associated Press notes that a few miles away from the finish line and at around the same time as the explosions, a fire broke out at the John F Kennedy Library. Boston police commissioner Edward Davis said it was not clear whether it was related to the bombings, and the JFK library said any suggestion of a link was \"pure speculation\". It is still unclear exactly how many people were injured, and how badly. State trooper Roupen Bastajian told the news agency: I started running toward the blast. And there were people all over the floor. We started grabbing tourniquets and started tying legs. A lot of people amputated ... At least 25 to 30 people have at least one leg missing, or an ankle missing, or two legs missing. Alasdair Conn, chief of emergency services at Massachusetts General Hospital, said: \"This is something I've never seen in my 25 years here ... this amount of carnage in the civilian population. This is what we expect from war.\" In Boston, Adam Gabbatt reports on the FBI\u2019s searching of a residential building in Revere, eight miles north-east of the city, where they removed a large bag from an apartment in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Authorities including FBI agents and local police descended on the 13-storey Ocean Shores Tower on Ocean Avenue in the neighborhood at around 11pm on Monday. Reports suggested an apartment on the fifth floor was being searched. A panel in the lobby showed the building's elevators remaining on the fifth floor for some time. Police sporadically entered and left the building but would not answer questions. At around 2am a group of officials emerged from the building and walked swiftly toward vehicles in the forecourt. One man carried a large black plastic bag which he placed in the back of a grey saloon before driving off at speed. A sign that read: \"Official FBI business\" could be seen on the dashboard of the vehicle. Massachusetts state police confirmed that a search warrant related to the investigation into the explosions was served in the suburb, but provided no further details. Earlier on Tuesday morning, police officers had quizzed two male Saudi Arabian students in the lobby of the building. Speaking beforehand, one of the men told the Guardian that he was there to meet a friend who lived on the fifth floor. Police examined the men's passports and appeared to make telephone calls before escorting them into the elevator. Adam also posts this \u201crunner\u2019s eye view\u201d of the first explosion. He adds that no group has yet claimed responsibility for the blast and the Pakistani Taliban - which has previously threatened attacks in the US and claimed responsibility for a failed car-bombing in New York's Times Square - denied any involvement. The FBI is leading federal, state and local law enforcement agencies in investigating the bombings, Reuters reports. No one has yet been arrested. A White House official told the news agency the case would be treated as an act of terrorism but it was not clear yet whether it came from a foreign or domestic source. Reuters said the bombs used gunpowder as the explosive and were packed with ball bearings and other shrapnel to maximise injuries. Juan Cole at Informed Comment has written a thoughtful piece comparing sympathetic reactions from the Muslim world to the Boston bombings to the response of Fox News contributor Erik Rush, who sarcastically tweeted of Muslims on Monday: \u201cthey\u2019re evil. Let\u2019s kill them all.\u201d Cole did concede that it was also \u201ceasy for jingoists to find Chinese or Arabs on Twitter gloating\u201d. Cole noted the large numbers of people killed in bombings in Iraq and Syria yesterday, and asks: Having experienced the shock and grief of the Boston bombings, cannot we in the US empathise more with Iraqi victims and Syrian victims? An article in the Boston Globe indicates how badly injured many of the wounded in Boston are. Liz Norden\u2019s two sons, age 31 and 33, each lost a leg from the knee down. Norden\u2019s younger son\u2019s girlfriend also suffered serious burns and other injuries. They had gone to watch a friend run the marathon. The paper writes: \u201cI\u2019d never imagined in my wildest dreams this would ever happen,\u201d Norden said, sitting on a bench outside the Beth Israel Deaconess emergency room Monday night. As she looked at her feet, with socks mismatched because she had dressed so quickly to leave the house, tears fell to the sidewalk. \u201cI feel sick,\u201d she said. \u201cI think I could pass out.\u201d Norden didn\u2019t want to release their names without talking to them, the Globe writes. My colleague Paddy Allen has created this interactive map of the sites of the two explosions. Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, has spoken about security at Sunday's marathon in the British capital: We do have robust security measures in place for Sunday's London Marathon, but given events in Boston it's only prudent for the police and the organisers of Sunday's race to re-examine those security arrangements. The man in an orange vest who can be seen in video footage of the first explosion crumpling dramatically to the ground is safe and well and even managed to finish the marathon. Bill Iffrig, 78, told ESPN2: The shockwaves must have hit my body and my legs just started going like noodles and I knew I was going down right there A race official came to help him, and he struggled to his feet and crossed the finish line, according to the Daily Mail. This Boston Globe video recorded both explosions as they happened. Good morning. At least three people were killed on Monday and more than 100 injured in two large explosions at the Boston Marathon. An eight-year-old boy is among the dead. The blasts took place just feet away from the finish line as hundreds of runners were competing in the race. A US intelligence official told the Associated Press that as many as two unexploded bombs were also found near the end of the marathon\u2019s course, but were safely disarmed, although the Guardian is unable to confirm this. Asked whether this was a terrorist attack, Boston police commissioner Ed Davis said yesterday: \"We're not being definitive about this right now, but you can reach your own conclusions based on what happened.\" Barack Obama also avoided the word terrorism when describing the attack. He said those responsible would feel the \"full weight of justice\": We will find out who did this and we will hold them accountable. Make no mistake, we will find out who did this and why they did this, and the groups or individuals responsible will feel the full weight of justice. It is unclear who carried out the attack \u2013 and whether they were from America or elsewhere. The attack fell on Patriots' Day, a Massachusetts state holiday to mark the first battles of the revolutionary war against Britain, as well as \"Tax Day\" in the US, the deadline for individuals to file their tax returns. It is also close to the 19 April anniversary of the 1995 Oklahoma bombing and the end of the Waco siege in 1993. In Britain, sports minister Hugh Robertson said he was \u201cabsolutely confident\u201d that this Sunday\u2019s London marathon could be kept safe. Police said they would be reviewing security arrangements. We\u2019ll have live coverage of all developments here throughout the day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
