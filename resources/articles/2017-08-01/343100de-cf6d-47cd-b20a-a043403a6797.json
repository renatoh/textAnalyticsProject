It\u2019s a misleadingly cutesy start. After 2015\u2019s disco-infused prog record Ten Love Songs, the Norwegian songwriter and producer is having her Biophilia moment. Inspired by travels around varied political and social landscapes, from North Korea to the Amazon rainforest, there are trickling water sounds, wiry bleeps and animal peeps throughout. Sundf\u00f8r is startlingly back-to-basics at times \u2013 there are even schmaltzy ballad tones \u2013 but frequently her straightforward songs derail brilliantly. The sombre Good Luck Bad Luck is like an Adele song, if Adele sung about oil spills to the sound of smoky, late-night jazz. Music for People in Trouble is an art installation-like interlude, while folk song The Sound of War declares that \u201cchaos remains\u201d and ends with a moody, cinematic soundscape. Another triumph for Sundf\u00f8r, who delivers complex, maudlin subjects with lightness and majesty."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
