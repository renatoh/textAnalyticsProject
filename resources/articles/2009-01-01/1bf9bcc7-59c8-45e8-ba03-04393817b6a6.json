The latest delay comes as EU observers were deployed at gas pumping stations in Ukraine to monitor the flow of Russian gas through the country. Hundreds of thousands of homes across Europe have been left without heating after the two-week long dispute. It is unlikely that gas will reach them before Tuesday, given Gazprom's statement. Gas experts say that once Russia resumes supplies, it will take 30 hours for the gas to reach Ukraine and a further 36 hours to reach the first EU countries, such as Slovakia. But this evening Gazprom said it was yet to receive a copy of the monitoring agreement \"through official channels\". \"This is delaying our work and the start of monitors' work at the facilities,\" said a spokesman, Sergei Kupriyanov. The Russian president, Dmitri Medvedev, said today that his country would only restart gas supplies to Europe once it had a copy of the deal and all the EU monitors were in place. \"If those conditions are met the resumption of transit will start,\" he said. Russian supplies a quarter of Europe's gas requirement and 80% of this supply is transited through Ukraine. The standoff over gas prices between Moscow and Kiev is the latest in a series of disputes between Russia and Ukraine. The EU has accused the two countries of making Europeans hostages in their dispute, warning Moscow it risks losing its reputation as a reliable supplier and Kiev its status as an EU partner."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
