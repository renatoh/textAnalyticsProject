Come back from hols. And here's \u00a33,750", "bodyText": "\u2022 There is a time for tightened purse-strings and a time to forget costs. And that will be the thinking at Westminster, as MPs return early from their holidays to discuss an attack on Syria. But they're people of the world. When they go on holiday it is not easy to get them back. Luckily, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority understands, so those who are abroad will be able to fly themselves to Britain and back out again afterwards. Just keep those receipts. Each can claim up to \u00a33,750. \u2022 Still, let us not be pessimistic, for an attack is far from inevitable. Last night we learned that Nick Griffin is off to Syria. A \"BNPeace mission\", apparently. \"Once again Nick Griffin is putting his life on the line to stop the Cameron regime from committing war crimes in the name of the British people,\" the party says. Breathe easy. Everyone listens to chairman Nick. \u2022 The question asked of the Metropolitan police by the widow of the much-loved former Tottenham MP, Bernie Grant, was a fairly simple one. In the light of revelations about undercover officers snooping on the family of Stephen Lawrence and their supporters, could they tell her what surveillance, if any, was conducted on Bernie Grant and his family during the horrid aftermath of the disturbances on Broadwater Farm in the 1980s? The inquiry was highlighted in the Diary and, like most freedom of information requests, due for response within 20 days. But 20 days came and went without any light being shed. What's happening, Sharon Grant asked them. Er, well, there's a problem, came the reply. We're thinking about withholding any information on the basis that it might jeopardise inquiries, sources, operatives, that sort of thing. We'll get back to you, they said. Do you think someone's a bit worried? \u2022 A life of contrasts for Mark Thompson, the former BBC director general. MPs over here want nothing more than to quiz him in detail about what he knew about Jimmy Savile, and when. They'd like to see a lot more of him. At the same time, according to New York magazine, editors at the New York Times wonder about his frequent appearance in the newsroom. Some might like to see him a bit less. Thompson, the paper's CEO, is in charge of developing business for it. But according to this report, he isn't one for limits. \"I could be the editor of the New York Times. I have that background,\" is how it quotes him. Attaboy. Never knowingly undersold. \u2022 As the government continues cutting, what impact will it have on our national heritage? The team handling that sort of thing on the prime minister's behalf is hardly top drawer. Still, they know a significant building when they see it. Thus there is recognition for that little gap in the mountain region between Pakistan and Afghanistan to be found in Buckinghamshire. Culture minister Ed Vaizey this week \"listed\" Heatherden Hall, part of Pinewood Studios and location for the colonial residence of Sir Sidney Ruff-Diamond (played by Sid James) in the 1968 historical comedy classic, Carry On Up the Khyber. Readers unfamiliar with this masterwork need only note the names of the other lead characters \u2013 Kenneth Williams as the Khasi of Kalabar, Charles Hawtrey as Private James Widdle and Bernard Bresslaw as Bungdit Din. A world away, perhaps, but now part of our national heritage. Well done, minister. Lest we forget. \u2022 Finally, it's that day. The day of reckoning. A day that has been anticipated by progressive right-thinking people in this country and no doubt abroad too. Jeremy Paxman last appeared on BBC2's Newsnight on 14 August, at which time he sported that beard and voiced the belief that he and he alone would decide the duration of his facial hair rebellion. Well, then he disappeared from our screens. But now he's back. He'll be in the chair on Thursday night. Will he have shaved it off? The BBC is unable to shed any light. But then Jeremy does what Jeremy does. So long as he removes the earring, he'll be fine. Twitter: @hugh_muir"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
