The Italian 11th seed Flavia Pennetta beat her 7-5, 6-2 and meets Serena Williams in the quarter-finals on Wednesday, with Victoria Azarenka likely to be waiting for her in the semi-finals. Pennetta was all-round too strong for Dellacqua who, at 29, is having probably her best season, having also reached the fourth round in Melbourne this year, and she returns to Perth with plenty of quality tennis to take into a three-week Asia swing. On her way to the fourth round here, she beat the rising Czech Karolina Pliskova, who had just put former world No1 and eighth seed Ana Ivanovic out of the tournament, then gave Pennetta a solid challenge on Arthur Ashe in the first day match on Monday. \u201cI thought it might take me more time to find my feet because it\u2019s a little bit of a different court out there,\u201d she said of the tournament\u2019s cavernous main arena. \u201cFlavia has done it before here, and I haven\u2019t. I was just trying to take it all in. \u201cSometimes you can get a little caught behind the baseline because it\u2019s such a different visual thing out there, more than probably any other court in the world, purely because it is so big. We played on it in the doubles final [last year with compatriot Ashleigh Barty], but it\u2019s different when you have a partner; you\u2019re not hanging out there by yourself.\u201d She did OK by herself, none the less, giving Pennetta a scare in the first set at 4-5 on the Italian\u2019s serve, before fading in the second. \u201cI think she freed up a little bit saving that one,\u201d Dellacqua said, \u201cswung out a little bit. [Then] she found her feet better, her rhythm. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed [with] that loss, but overall I\u2019m happy with where I\u2019m heading, I\u2019m happy with the tournament I\u2019ve had, the tennis I\u2019ve played. I\u2019m definitely not complacent with where I\u2019m at because I\u2019m reaching career highs. In the last 12 months, there was only one way I was going to go, and it was [up]. I need to continue to work hard, consolidate my space in the top 30. \u201cI\u2019m 29, I\u2019m not a spring chicken. I\u2019m not going to go out there and start changing things within my game. I\u2019ve been away for five weeks. I\u2019m looking forward to getting home, seeing [her one-year-old son] Blake, being home, being a mum for the next week, just relaxing, switching off.\u201d After rising a hundred ranking places from 130 a year ago and performing with distinction in a slam against most expectations, she has earned it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
