Tindall for Mike Catt in the centre is the only change made by England's head coach Clive Woodward from the side that defeated France 24-7 last Sunday, while Australia have also confined themselves to a solitary new place with the prop Al Baxter replacing the injured Ben Darwin. Catt was brought into the midfield against France to provide an extra tactical kicking option to Jonny Wilkinson, who had been rushed into errors against South Africa, Samoa and Wales. Mortlock, who scored Australia's only try against the All Blacks with a 75-yard interception, expected Tindall's return. \"It shows England will be looking to play a wide game against us and it is very much an attacking selection,\" he said. \"They have the option of Catt on the bench if they want to tighten things up.\" England will field 14 of the side that comprehensively defeated Australia at Melbourne last June with Matt Dawson for Kyran Bracken at scrum-half the only change. \"We have brought Tindall in to supplement our midfield, not to counter Mortlock,\" said Woodward. \"Catt was brought in with France in mind and the change for Saturday is not an indication of how we will play the game. The problems we had in earlier rounds when we were too narrow was not Wilkinson's fault but the team's. \"We can play it wide or tight and conditions will dictate how we play the game. I get paid to win Test matches and we have won our last four against Australia. How you go about it up to you and if we want to play boring rugby we will. The media stuff is all good fun and if you can't take it you should not be here.\" The propaganda war, page 32"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
