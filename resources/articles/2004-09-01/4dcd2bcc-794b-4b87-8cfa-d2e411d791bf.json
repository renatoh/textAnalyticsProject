I can't remember any coaching course saying this is what you do and, by the way, if you're caught with a bird your life will be made an absolute nightmare, you are going to be ripped to shreds. There's politics all the time. One thing about Sven-Goran Eriksson, he's a fantastic politician. With his demeanour he could be working in the cabinet right now. He's got that, and he doesn't take the bait. If it was me, all hell would be breaking loose, because I'm not a politician. Being England manager, you must enjoy picking the best players in the world - absolutely fantastic - because some of the best players in the world are playing for England. The lifestyle's fantastic. Living in London, you go to see any game of football you want, you travel where you want, first class, you have a celebrity status, you have anyone you want in your back-up staff. These are all the good things. You're playing World Cup and European Championship games, but the reason why you're getting paid that amount of money is because we've now got the most vicious press in the world. I think he gets paid that much to take that stress, to take those lonely nights, the fact that if he has a bad result and he's walking down the street, people are thinking, \"You're useless, you're rotten, I wish you'd go away.\" In a way the press have got him the money he craves. If you take that job you have to be prepared that your whole lifestyle will be ripped apart, your body language, what you've done, how you've behaved. That is the problem. If you're going for the money, which is big money, there's one thing you'll miss, which is the coaching. I don't know why they call him head coach. Where does the coaching come in? These guys don't need much coaching. If you've got good players, all you need to do is keep them amused for an hour. That's it when you've got that standard of player. Once you've got a shape and you've got intelligent players, they don't need to be shown, they only need to be told. Then there's motivation. If I'm at a club paying somebody \u00a350,000 a week, I can use any motivational tactic I want, whether it be rough, smooth or downright hellish, I can get them to play. But you can't do that at international level, because they're not there for the money. They will get more in an afternoon with their club than in the whole year for England. If I'm an international manager, I can't be as rough with players: they're there because they want to be. People want managers to criticise players for a mistake but you cannot do that. You want to put these players back with their clubs feeling as good about themselves as they can. They don't need an international manager slaughtering them. When I was playing for Scotland, I played in the days when you were paid \u00a3100 but the tax was \u00a360. So I got \u00a340 for playing in front of 50 or 60,000 people. One time I had guests coming; I had to pay for 10 tickets. It came to \u00a3220 for those. I got a bill for \u00a3180 when I was still in my dirty gear after getting beaten by the Republic of Ireland. So don't say that international players are overpaid. The players get very little playing for England. The bonuses don't matter to them. All these guys are millionaires and they do it because they want to do it. So as a manager, you have got to treat them with kid gloves. It's not your right to rip them to pieces after the game. They're not playing for you, they're playing for their country. People talk about management styles and, if you talk to the players now, the players are running it. If the manager doesn't talk to the players, he's too aloof. So we've gone from different managers recently, one who doesn't talk to the players and blames them after a defeat - he's too aloof - while one who protects them all the time is not positive enough. I think Sven is all right at his relationship with the club managers. I've worked with him a couple of times and he's always, \"How's your player?\" He was always asking my opinion about whether he can play another game. So I've not got a problem with Sven one little bit. He will be judged on decisions he makes. This week he's got them right."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
