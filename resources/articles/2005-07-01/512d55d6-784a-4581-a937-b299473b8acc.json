It forecasts prices will end this year 5% lower than in 2004. Hometrack said the average house price, based on its surveys of estate agents, was now \u00a3161,300, down 3.7% compared with the same time last year and contradicting surveys from the Nationwide and Halifax which showed prices still slightly higher. \"The market is showing no signs of recovery. While housing transactions have grown slightly all other indicators - prices, time to sell and numbers of buyers - are worsening,\" said John Wriglesworth, Hometrack's economist. The report said only one county, Berkshire, had seen a rise in prices this month; 17 had seen no change and 39 had experienced falls. Hereford and Worcester suffered the biggest falls. Mr Wriglesworth said he expected the Bank of England to cut interest rates in August. Hometrack expects the market to steady in 2006 with low unemployment and interest rates. Other economists expect substantial house price falls next year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
