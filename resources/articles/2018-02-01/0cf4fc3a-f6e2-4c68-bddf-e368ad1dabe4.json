Debra Frances was originally brought into Aunty as a consultant to work on the restructure of the organisation but Guthrie was so enamoured of her skills she brought her in-house, giving her a staff card and the newly created title of \u201chead of transformation\u201d. But just two months into the project \u2013 which will see the old TV, radio and news divisions broken up \u2013 another exec, Anne Milne, is stepping up to complete \u201cthe execution phase of the restructure\u201d, according to an email to the executive team from finance chief Louise Higgins. \u201cAs you know, the ABC has done a significant amount of work in shaping its Content Team Redesign proposal,\u201d Higgins said. \u201cWith this work largely complete I wanted to let you know that Debra Frances will be leaving the organisation from today and will be pursuing other opportunities. I would very much like to thank Debra for her hard work and wish her all the best for the future.\u201d The sound and the fury The high-profile departure comes before the inaugural ABC annual public meeting at Ultimo headquarters next Friday. The public event will include keynote addresses from chairman Justin Milne, Guthrie and Higgins, as well as information about programming and a Q&amp;A session with questions from the public. One of the questions uppermost on the public\u2019s mind may just be the dismantling of the ABC\u2019s sound and reference libraries. PM presenter Linda Mottram branded it \u201cripping the heart out\u201d and insiders tell Weekly Beast the move is \u201cpremature\u201d as so little is digitised and would mean specialist music was no longer be easy to find. Protests appear to be in vain. The culling of the libraries is already well under way and management is digging its heels in. Jana drama In the 1980s and 90s many aspiring journalists wanted to be Jana Wendt, the \u201cperfumed steamroller\u201d who ruled the TV screen in the 1980s and 90s. From 60 Minutes to A Current Affair, Seven\u2019s Witness program and later to SBS and the ABC, Wendt was widely admired not just for her telegenic presence but for her tough, take-no-prisoners style and her record of standing up to sexism. At her peak she assumed almost movie star status and was the highest paid person on television. When she famously walked off the ACA set at Channel Nine, refusing to introduce a story about topless shop assistants, she won a legion of female fans and was hailed a feminist hero. So it came as a considerable shock to read Wendt\u2019s rambling thoughts on the #MeToo movement published in The Spectator\u2019s Australian edition under the heading Public Shaming. We\u2019re a bit late to the piece but a comment by Andrew Bolt that Jana was \u201csensational on #notmetoo\u201d piqued our curiosity. \u201cThe whole [Harvey Weinstein] affair came as a terrible shock to the rest of us since the idea of casting couches and trading parts of one\u2019s body for better parts on screen was previously unknown,\u201d she said sarcastically. \u201cThere were Hollywood sirens who had not spoken for decades but who rose from their beds to give voice to condemnation of Weinstein.\u201d Wendt went on to question the bona fides of those who spoke up about sexual harassment and the use of the acronym LGBTI and to reveal that she was contacted by a journalist who thought she too might have been a victim. \u201cWith a surprising degree of confidence, the friendly reporter suggested the alleged roll call of victims included me.\u201d Wrong, says Jana, \u201cthe man had never touched me\u2026 #NotMeToo\u201d. Mitchell\u2019s mantra Chris Mitchell, the former editor-in-chief of the Australian, doesn\u2019t want to change the date of Australia Day. No surprises there. But in his media column this week he mounted a spurious argument to say Indigenous Australians were in favour of the status quo, you just had to find the right ones to talk to. It\u2019s the \u201cself-identifying mixed heritage Aboriginal activists\u201d who claim it is offensive to celebrate on that day, Mitchell says, going on to scold the ABC for giving a platform to Indigenous people who favour a change. And what is Mitchell\u2019s evidence for this claim? \u201cA friend of mine intimately connected to the Aboriginal world gave me his one-sentence assessment, and it again sails close to Section 18C. \u2018As everyone in the NT knows, the extent of an Aboriginal person\u2019s engagement with the Australia Day debate is in inverse proportion to their genetic Aboriginal ancestry.\u2019\u201d Financials reviewed Fairfax Media announced \u2013 in a six-paragraph \u201cexclusive\u201d on page 29 of the Australian Financial Review on Thursday \u2013 that the downsized newspaper company was moving at the end of 2019 to new digs in the CBD. The 950 journalists and other staff based at the Pyrmont HQ, near Star casino and not much else, breathed a sigh of relief that the plug on the 20-year lease had been pulled early. They have been wanting to leave the \u201cwasteland\u201d of Pyrmont ever since they reluctantly moved there from Darling Harbour almost 10 years ago. As Google grew bigger and Fairfax shrank, the tech company has been leasing more and more floor space from Fairfax, leading the Maserati-driving Fairfax boss, Greg Hywood, to concede he should move out and give the whole 9,000 square metre lease over three floors to Google. \u201cWe\u2019re excited to start the search for a new Sydney headquarters for Fairfax Media,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cAfter a decade in our current Pyrmont offices, moving to new fit-for-purpose workspace in or around the CBD from late 2019 will be welcomed by staff and reflect our modern media business.\u201d The spacious, fancy fit-out at Pyrmont never suited the journalists who wanted access to courts, parliament, food and a train station, not to mention a pub. Swimming against the stream When News Corp took over Foxtel and announced it would merge the pay TV company with Fox Sports, the battle was on to decide which chief executive would prevail: Foxtel boss Peter Tonagh or Fox Sports CEO Patrick Delany. This week Delany came out on top to lead the merged Foxtel-Fox Sports when the deal is finalised next month. Foxtel is going through a turbulent period with no less than three CEOs in three years in the tough television market. Tonagh stepped up in March 2016 after the departure of Richard Freudenstein, who had led the company for four years. With more viewers opting for cheaper streaming products such as Netflix and Stan, Foxtel\u2019s premium offering of $120 a month is a hard sell. Late last year Tonagh introduced a new branding for Foxtel along with a cheaper streaming version called Foxtel Now for as low as $15 a month and an Apple TV style box for $99. Delany is going to have to do even more to keep Foxtel firing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
