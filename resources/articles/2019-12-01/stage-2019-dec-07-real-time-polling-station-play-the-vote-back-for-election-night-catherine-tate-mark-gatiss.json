Stars Catherine Tate and Mark Gatiss will be back together on the evening of Thursday\u2019s election to perform Graham\u2019s new version along with a full cast, including Bill Paterson and Nina Sosanya, for one night only at Bush House in central London. The play is set once again in the final 90 minutes of polling in a marginal seat. In 2015, the original Donmar Warehouse production, labelled \u201ca glorious night at the polling station\u201d by the Observer, was broadcast on More4 in real time as voting closed, and was nominated for a Bafta. Election night parties are thin on the ground, and many voters will be looking for distraction. Graham\u2019s play offers a compromise, since the playwright will be asked to read out the exit polls the minute the play finishes at 10pm. \u201cIt is not your average Christmas show, but the strange, twee way we run elections in this country means that many polling stations are in the same places that carol concerts and nativity plays are being staged,\u201d said Graham. \u201cWe wanted to bring people together, and Josie and I also felt that the arts often departs too quickly from the political scene and just hands the baton to journalists and pundits,\u201d he added. Rourke said: \u201cWe enjoyed it so much the first time, we wanted to restage the whole exercise again. But it was fascinating to see what had changed.\u201d The core mechanics of the play, its elements of farce, have endured, she added, because the key characters \u2013 the three clerks in the polling station, and those who come in to vote \u2013 are limited in time and space. \u201cYet not only was the last time pre-European referendum, it was also at a time when people were still wondering about the possibility of a hung parliament and imagining what chaos that might bring,\u201d said Rourke. \u201cJames is not looking to write a stinging political satire. He wants instead to be fair to all sides and so he remains hidden in the text.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
