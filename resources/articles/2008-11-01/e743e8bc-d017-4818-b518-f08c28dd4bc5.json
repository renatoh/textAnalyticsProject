Sarah Lacy - notorious for her interview with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg at last year's South by Southwest festival - comes in to chat about her new book: \"The Stories of Facebook, Youtube and Myspace: The People, the Hype and the Deals Behind the Giants of Web 2.0\" As she's also a Business Week columnist from Silicon Valley, presenter of Yahoo's tech ticker show, and something of a tech celebrity, we couldn't help but also ask her opinion of the Yahoo/Microsoft saga too. We also hear from Stefan Oberg, the Skype Vice President. He tells us how the business is maturing - thought the company isn't running out of people to sign up to it's services. He discusses a recent breach of privacy at a Chinese partner, and Skype's mobile ambitions. Also in the studio is Charles Arthur and Bobbie Johnson is on the line from San Francisco. There's this week's news and highlights from the blog too.
