He tries to live there too, with an almost Buddha-like simplicity, in a makeshift home tucked among the roots of a sprawling banyan tree. Massing has been performing most of his adult life, as a founding member of Vanuatu\u2019s renowned fire dance troupe, and as one of the anchors of Dropvkal Groove, a roots music collective. But now he has emerged \u2013 from his first ever visit inside a recording studio \u2013 with a debut album, Sorousian, drawing inspiration from his volcanic home island of Ambrym, as well as his new arboreal place on Efate island. The album was produced by Wantok Records, a Melbourne-based label that specialises in fostering indigenous talent from Melanesia and Timor. Studio head David Bridie was one of Sorousian\u2019s producers. Massing, he says, \u201cis an effortless artist, in the way he sings and plays guitar ... he comes up with these very textured vocal layers, adds in overdubs of shakers and tam tam and percussion\u201d. Black Butterfly, Massing\u2019s first single, is about, ostensibly, a black butterfly. But the metaphor runs deeper, invoking the fleeting evanescence of the creature\u2019s existence when he sings: \u201cI\u2019m still living, so I must sing, for the voices that can\u2019t be heard any more.\u201d Is Massing the black butterfly? \u201cMaybe I am one of the black butterflies, one of the people who dream to live free with the land,\u201d he tells the Guardian. \u201cBut you know it doesn\u2019t really work today. It\u2019s a dream \u2026 everyone loves it, they\u2019re talking about it, but I\u2019m not living it. Something we all claim to love, something we all say we want. Something we don\u2019t have the courage and the frailty to be,\u201d Massing says. \u201cThat\u2019s the life I named black butterfly.\u201d Living in Vanuatu, the country ranked the most vulnerable on earth to natural disasters and the impacts of climate change, the environment, its decay and its fragility, are recurrent themes. \u201cI have to do something for this earth, as well as for the next generation: for my kids and their kids, you know?\u201d, Massing says. He finds music \u2013 or rather music finds him \u2013 everywhere. \u201cWhat is happening around inspires me to share my world through music. And I\u2019m representing communities of other people as well,\u201d he says, such as in Morning Star Bae Kam, a paean to Melanesian neighbour West Papua\u2019s struggle for independence, where he urges a continued resilience: \u201cThis song is the struggle/The struggle is this song.\u201d On the outskirts of Port Vila, Massing has built himself a single tiny room out of bamboo and cast-off timbers tucked into the roots of a towering banyan tree, known in Vanuatu as a nambanga. It\u2019s an unhurried existence in his treehouse, an atmosphere that informs his songwriting. Massing\u2019s songs shift from line to line between Vanuatu pidgin Bislama, Ambrymese, and English. Is he worried that his magpie lyrics will leave people behind? \u201cIt\u2019s what I believe in, what I\u2019m seeing.\u201d But will people understand? \u201cMaybe, or maybe not\u2026 like, if I get one person out of the crowd, then that\u2019s alright, you know? If someone is trying to think of what I\u2019m trying to see, then that\u2019s all right. And if it\u2019s no one, that\u2019s all right.\u201d He smiles broadly, \u201cThis album is kind of like an experiment of the local music of Vanuatu.\u201d In polyglot Vanuatu, language is a potent bearer of history, and custom, and place. Mumbwe, Massing\u2019s second single, is derived from from the custom of his home island of Ambrym. The bare bones melody is a reworking of a song used in the Rom customary dance Massing used to watch as a child. The language used in the song is lost from everyday use, but preserved in song. \u201cThat,\u201d Massing says quietly, \u201cis the kind of experimenting I\u2019ve been doing.\u201d Recording Sorousian was Massing\u2019s first ever time in a studio, and there is quaint juxtaposition to the album that time has produced. The album, now, lives everywhere, on streaming services to every corner of the globe: Massing remains at home, under the banyan tree, just living.
