This is not the halfway point of a four-week campaign at all. If the polls are to be believed, Election 2001 is all but over already. Certainly Labour is giving the appearance of fighting the next election by setting out 10-year plans for the 'renewal' of Britain. June's vote will make us little wiser as to whether it can succeed. But a euro referendum, which Labour will decide on within two years, could be much more significant. So in a sense the real campaigning starts on 8 June. In many ways, particularly for business, Election 2001 is like Hamlet without the Prince or, more topically, like the Spice Girls (or the Tories) without Geri Halliwell. The missing spice is the euro, the coin without a face, the currency that, for the time being at least, dare not speak its name. Most politicians have been reluctant to talk about it for fear of splitting their parties. And business has followed their non-lead. Neither the Confederation of British Industry nor the British Chambers of Commerce is placing it to the fore in their election campaigning. But both are laying the groundwork for membership polls later this year. Labour has tried to eliminate the issue from the election. Its manifesto says Labour is in favour in principle and would assess Gordon Brown's five economic tests 'early' in the next parliament before a possible referendum. Most Labour supporters seem happy. Michael Jacobs of the Fabian Society, says: 'The position is robust - holding a referendum and campaigning for entry but only when the conditions are right. It's difficult for the Conservatives to attack that.' Some of the businessmen who signed last Monday's letter to the Times pledging support for Blair, did so despite their strong euro enthusiasm, and their disappointment that we are not there yet. People such as Granada's Gerry Robinson and Lord Haskins of Northern Foods see the merits in economic terms. But they accept that joining is a political judgement. Robinson says: 'They are going to have to bite the bullet and get us all in.' But he adds: 'You have to be very sensitive that this is subject to rabble-rousing. Now is not the time to push it.' That is not to say the pressure is not there. One person behind the orchestration of the Times letter says: 'There have been moans from people like Niall FitzGerald [head of Unilever] about not being gung-ho about the euro.' Fitzgerald's name did not appear on the letter. Nevertheless, if the Government wants business to proselytise for the new currency - something the CBI has resisted since Digby Jones took over from the strongly pro-euro Adair Turner - it has work to do in swinging support round. Business surveys over the past two years show support waning. A CBI membership consultation in July 1999 found 50 per cent in favour of joining either as soon as possible or before 2005, with a further 28 per cent in favour in principle. Recent polls have been more equivocal. An Engineering Employers Federation survey in March this year - polling the manufacturing sector, which has complained about overvalued sterling since 1996 - found 21 per cent in favour, 14 per cent against; 29 per cent were supportive in principle, 36 per cent said wait and see, and 8 per cent were completely against. Stephen Radley of the EEF says enthusiastic firms have become more cautious, although the number of antis had not risen. This toughening of opinion comes despite other research, from, for example, the National Institute of Social and Economic Research in January (see Martin Weale below), showing Britain's economy moving into line with Europe. An Item Club report in March found that the UK would be 'technically' ready to join by 2003, adding that Labour should 'grab the bull by the horns and start to argue the case immediately'. Haskins believes Blair should get on with it: 'The examination of the tests will take a few months; that should start in the latter part of the year, and we should be discussing these issues very seriously after Christmas.' John Monks of the pro-euro TUC agrees, pointing out that 300,000 manufacturing jobs were lost during the period of the pound's strength against the euro: 'The Government must stop this appearance of dither. If it has not made a commitment in the first year after the election, I think it will be very difficult to do it in the lifetime of the next parliament.' But there will be problems ahead. Says Jacobs: 'It may be difficult for the Conservatives to attack the euro position, but they may raise the great bogey of the European super state.' Herein lie a host of spectres - from tax harmonisation and more qualified majority voting to loss of sovereignty and 'meddling' Brussels. Business may be sympathetic to this line. BCC and EEF respondents cited the threat of tax harmonisation as a key concern. Even within the Labour 'big tent', there is argument. Manufacturing unions such as the GMB and AEEU are in favour; others, such as Unison are against, believing the euro would cut public service funding, creating a 'bankers' Europe', sucking power from democratic institutions. Jacobs says many Labour members are in favour of the euro, not for commercial reasons, but because it strengthens the EU as the only organisation capable of regulating global business environmentally and socially. Interestingly, he says, this is more a Brown than a Blair agenda. Blair appears more pro-Europe than Brown. But if he calls a referendum, the likelihood of Brown succeeding him rises: if he wins, his great ambition is achieved; if he loses, he is a busted flush. But Haskins observes sardonically: 'No other issue splits the Conservatives like Europe. It may be in Labour's interests to keep delaying a referendum, just to keep the Tories split.'
