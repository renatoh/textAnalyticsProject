The hotel, part of a small, privately owned group, is a fabulous fusion of exposed brick, wood parquet and white emulsion and reopened in the spring after a total refurbishment. The 47 double rooms and suites now flaunt a French colonial style with heavy teak four-poster beds, Persian rugs, and pretty balconies, and the hotel has a garden with decked walkways at the rear. Bath oil, shampoo and soap in the sleek bathrooms are all organically produced for the hotel. Breakfast is an organic buffet of charcuterie, cheese, yoghurt and breads, and there's a seasonal menu at dinner. It almost goes without saying that the hotel is totally non-smoking but you do get flat-screen TVs, free wireless internet access and feather duvets. \u00b7 This month and next, rooms cost from \u00a395 per night through hotels.co.uk, 0871 2000171."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
