Wilshere had a medical on Thursday and it is thought that he is likely to become West Ham\u2019s fourth summer signing. The 26-year-old has been looking for a new club after leaving Arsenal at the end of last season. He failed to agree a new contract with the north London club after being told that he was unlikely to be a regular starter under Unai Emery, who has replaced Arsene Wenger as Arsenal\u2019s manager. West Ham have signed Lukasz Fabianski, Ryan Fredericks and Issa Diop since appointing Manuel Pellegrini as their new manager in May. However, a move for Lazio\u2019s Felipe Anderson has stalled, with a fee for the Brazilian winger still not agreed. Meanwhile, the Football Association has suspended Tony Henry, former head of player recruitment at West Ham, from all football-related activity for a year over comments he made about African players. Henry was suspended by the Hammers before being sacked in February after he was accused of racism and discrimination for allegedly telling agents the Premier League club did not want to sign any more African players. Following an FA investigation he will now be banned from the game for a year and will be required to attend a course."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
