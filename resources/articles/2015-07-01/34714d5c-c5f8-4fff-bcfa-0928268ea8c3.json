The man, who has not been identified, was taken by air ambulance to Morriston hospital, where he later died. A nine-year-old boy was taken to the same A&amp;E unit by ambulance. The incident, which took place on Tuesday afternoon, is the second fatality in as many months to occur at the picturesque bay. In June, a 42-year-old man died after a similar incident in the waters. Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) senior lifeguard manager Matt Horton said Gower beach is susceptible to unpredictable and dangerous rip tides: \u201cA rip is a strong current of water running out to sea that can quickly drag you out beyond your depth. They can sometimes be identified by a channel of churning, choppy water or debris on the sea\u2019s surface.\u201d A South Wales police spokesman said: \u201cPolice can confirm that a man has died after getting into difficulty in the sea at Three Cliffs Bay in Gower. Emergency services were called to the area shortly after 3pm. The man was removed from the water and taken by helicopter to Morriston hospital.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
