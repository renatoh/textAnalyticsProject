While the sport\u2019s commentariat descended into a collective state of shock, Udvardy was pumping her fist and peering towards her coach. She quickly realised he was not staring back. \u201cI looked at my coach and he was talking to the supervisor. I was like: \u2018Come on, why are you talking to him? Watch the match!\u2019 And then I won, I played like three hours, I came off court. My coach told me that at 3-1 the supervisor had talked to him and cancelled the tournament.\u201d What happened next was a reflection of tennis\u2019s great weakness. Udvardy, a 21-year-old Hungarian ranked 347 by the WTA, had spent thousands of dollars to fly herself and her coach to Ol\u00edmpia with the goal of minimising costs by entering a series of tournaments in Brazil. While hundreds of players at Indian Wells, the fifth biggest tournament in the world, were offered first-round prize money to cover costs after its cancellation, she was forced to immediately purchase two tickets out of Brazil that she could not afford. The faulty financial model of tennis has long been problematic as prize money has disproportionately risen at the top over the past decades, but the coronavirus pandemic is a transformative moment that requires a sweeping response. Tennis players are private contractors who earn money only when they compete, or if they are lucky enough to encounter sponsorships. Now they earn nothing. For Udvardy, the $4,000 (\u00a33,150) she made before taxes in the first three months of this year was supplemented with sporadic coaching and small sponsorships from helpful companies. Those companies are now at risk and social distancing regulations forbid her from coaching. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m going to do if it\u2019s going to be much longer,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I can do anything else. I can\u2019t even go away and give lessons. It\u2019s just really hard. I think everyone is in the same situation as I am and we all need help from the ITF and WTA.\u201d In the same breath, she is quick to point out that her situation is better than most. She has received some assistance from the Hungarian federation and she is young \u2013 her desperation to fulfil her potential means that, no matter where she is financially whenever normality resumes, she will return to the foot of the mountain to climb again if she must. Instead, she is more concerned about those who may be pushed out of the sport for good. Udvardy is not alone in her reservations. \u201cI know a lot of players who are waking up and saying: \u2018Hey, I\u2019m gonna stop. I\u2019m already minus [in debt] and I don\u2019t think I can make it,\u2019\u201d says Valentini Grammatikopoulou of Greece. \u201cWhen I was [ranked] 400, four years ago, I was winning \u20ac1,000 and then travelling with this money to go to another tournament, even not thinking of going back home. That was the circle, that\u2019s how you build and get out of these small tournaments. People will now have nothing and they cannot even go to the tournaments.\u201d Although Greece possesses more top-20 players than Great Britain and France combined, Grammatikopoulou, ranked 297, has not received a penny of support. Greece\u2019s national federation is insignificant and she does not qualify for government financial help. For the first time in a decade she has returned to her small hometown of Axioupoli for more than just a couple of weeks. Her father sells curtains and pillows in the local market and the family is living off his government furlough. By all indications, tennis\u2019s stakeholders are finally appropriately recognising their forgotten classes. After hours of discussions with his fellow members Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, the ATP player council president, Novak Djokovic, last week sent an email to players detailing his proposed relief fund for those ranked between 250 and 700. The fund would include a sliding scale of contributions from top-100 players based on ranking groups, ranging from $30,000 contributed by top-five players to $5,000 by those ranked between 50 and 100. Along with $500,000 contributions from grand slam tournaments and money sourced from future events, the hope is for a pot of between $4m and $4.5m, with $10k for each player. The WTA is said to be in similar discussions on behalf of its players. The proposal requires the votes of Djokovic\u2019s fellow players, some of whom may have qualms about contributing a far greater percentage of their earnings than the top players. Regardless, it represents an unprecedented period in the history of the sport, which was underlined by Djokovic\u2019s comments during his recent Instagram live chat with Stan Wawrinka. If the world No 1 has his way, this is a tipping point, an opportunity to change the lower levels of men\u2019s and women\u2019s tennis for ever. \u201cThese guys that are ranked 250 onwards, they are the ones that make the grassroots of tennis, that make the future of tennis and I feel we have to be united,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cWe have to support them. We have to show them that they are not forgotten, that we are there for them. But also I feel we have to send a message to the younger generations that are taking in consideration to be professional players, to show them that they can live out of tennis.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
