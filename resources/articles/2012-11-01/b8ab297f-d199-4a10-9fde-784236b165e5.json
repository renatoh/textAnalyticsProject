In most cameras these days, that mechanism is likely to be an electronic sensor to record the photograph digitally. (In this guide we are leaving film behind as a somewhat fond memory.) It can be more difficult to override the automatic settings on cheaper models, which might leave you feeling that you are not completely in control of the final image. For this chapter, we are going to assume your camera has manual settings as well as the \"programme\" modes. Lens lengths If your camera comes with a zoom lens, as most do, explore the different focal lengths and the effect each creates. Start with the wide-angle setting and notice any distortions and how it gives a slightly different reality from your own vision. Most news pictures are now shot using wider lenses; indeed, an extra\u2011wide lens has become the default for most photojournalists. Take a look at Dan Chung's picture (main image) of the devastation left by the Asian tsunami in 2004 to see how the extreme wide\u2011angle lens emphasises the scale of the disaster. Shoot some pictures and get comfortable with the wide settings before trying the other end of the scale, the telephoto. This lens \"telescopes\" the scene in front of the camera. Counterintuitively, this is a really nice way of shooting a landscape, as the different parts of the scene become stacked or compressed, often resulting in a patterned or painterly effect, as in Denis Thorpe's image of Hebden Bridge (below). A telephoto is also a good lens to use for close-up portraiture, giving a more flattering, slightly flattened perspective. Focus Most cameras have automatic focusing systems, but you should be aware of where the camera is focused. The simplest way is to use the centre-weighted option: pre-focus on your subject by holding the shutter release button halfway down, then frame the picture exactly as you would like before depressing the button completely. Keep an eye on the viewfinder to check the focus. Practise this technique, because many photographs you shoot won't have the subject in the centre of the frame or at the front. When shooting a close-up of a face, focus on the eye nearest the camera. ISO On my compact, the left-hand wheel sets the ISO rating: this regulates how sensitive the camera will be to light coming in to the lens. You might have heard film described as \"fast\" and \"slow\" \u2013 the faster the film (and the higher the ISO number) the more light-sensitive it is. Helpfully, digital cameras also use these numbers to describe the sensitivity of their sensors. An average setting for shooting in daylight would be 100, while indoor settings should be 400 to 800. Try not to go higher than 1,600, or you will introduce too much \"noise\" or grain to your images. As a general rule, keep the ISO as low as possible. Pre-programmed settings There is another wheel on most digital SLRs that selects the various exposure programmes the camera will run. There are normally automatic settings for different sorts of photography (such as portraits, landscapes and fast-moving subjects) but why don't we explore what's going on inside that box of tricks? Let's focus (sorry) on three of the settings: A (aperture priority), S (shutter priority) and M (manual). Aperture priority (sometimes called AV or aperture value) allows you to set the aperture, leaving the camera to select an appropriate shutter speed. Changing the aperture not only affects the level of light reaching the sensor but also the photograph's depth of field (the distance between the nearest and farthest objects that appear in focus). Shutter priority mode (S) allows you to choose a specific shutter speed and tells the camera to control the aperture. The shutter is the small, metal curtain that opens and closes to help control the quantity of light hitting the sensor. The longer it stays open, the more light is let in. Manual (M) provides the greatest level of control over the final image, by allowing you to set both shutter speed and aperture, depending on the lighting conditions and the effect you want to achieve. Depth of field By changing the aperture setting on your lens you can take control over the depth of field in your picture. The smaller the aperture, the more you get in focus. Setting a wider aperture enables you to soften the background or foreground in your image. The longer the focal length of the lens, the more marked the effect. Take a look at Murdo MacLeod's photograph above of a sunbathing couple on Portobello beach, Edinburgh (above). He's used a 24mm wide-angle lens, which has given him a helping hand with the depth of field, but he has still used a small aperture of f/13 to ensure that the bulk of the scene is in focus. Note that f/13 isn't an option on the barrel of our old lens. This is because electronic digital cameras can set the lens iris to any size and are not governed by crude mechanical click-stops. It's very common in portraiture, almost a visual cliche these days, but more and more news photographers are shooting \"wide-open\" (with a wide-open aperture) to isolate the subject from a busy background. A shallow depth of field helps tone down \"noisy\" or distracting colours and shapes in the background. Associated Press chief photographer Muhammed Muheisen uses this technique to draw your eye to the young Pakistani girl and her gun, despite the strong shapes of the man and bicycle (left). If you find this sort of shallow focus effect appealing, you could use the aperture priority mode on your camera to force it to use a wide setting; it will then automatically adjust the shutter speed to obtain the best exposure for the lighting conditions. But you might find you want to use a slow shutter speed as well, to introduce some movement, as in Muheisen's second image, for example (below). In this case you would have to make the camera less light-sensitive by changing the ISO rating to a lower value. This explains how the three settings are related. Light There is something arresting about Muheisen's pictures, and it isn't just his subjects: it's the soft quality of the daylight. MacLeod's couple on the beach in the scorching sunshine is great, but bright light is difficult to handle. Soft light at the beginning and end of the day often gives the best results. The sun is lower and more directional too, giving more modelling to your subjects. It's often best to \"shoot against the light\" or into the sun to avoid a flat, mundane result during the day. With so much light directed at the camera, you'll want to set the exposure for the subject, so open the lens one or two stops (or use the exposure compensation settings on your camera). The other way to approach this is to go for a silhouette. In this case you need a strong shape in your subject and a clean background. Simply expose for the background and the subject will be completely underexposed, as shown left in Denis Thorpe's image of St George's Place, Liverpool (left). Shooting in low light brings its own problems, but they are simple to overcome. If there's not enough light to achieve a decent exposure, open the lens as far as possible (which will give you a shallow depth of field, remember). When you can't go any wider, you will have to use longer and longer shutter speeds. You could alleviate this by dialling in a higher ISO, making the camera more light-sensitive, but that introduces graininess and \"noise\" patterns which may lead to poor quality. Realistically, you are left with the slow shutter-speed option. Most people with a steady hand can hold a camera without getting much noticeable \"camera shake\" down to about 1/30th of a second. If you want or need to use a longer shutter speed than that, the camera needs to be supported on a tripod, or basically anything firm and inanimate. Low-light or night photography is now perfectly possible. If you have a moving subject, there will be some blur. You can stop this by introducing flash, but beware: flashes don't travel far. Flashguns, built-in or otherwise, are of very limited use as a sole light source, but there are more creative ways to use them. A good alternative technique, giving professional-looking results, is to set your camera on a slow shutter speed to make use of some of the atmospheric \"available\" light. Make sure your camera is mounted firmly and there are no wobbles, then use your flash to illuminate the subject, like Chris Thomond's superb schoolboy picture (above). Chris used a flashgun located away from the camera, but an on-camera flash will give a similar, cleaned-up, slightly surreal result. Finally, the great thing about digital cameras is that they have no ongoing costs, such as film and developing. You can experiment over and over again and immediately see the results \u2013 for free \u2013 so tweak as you shoot."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
