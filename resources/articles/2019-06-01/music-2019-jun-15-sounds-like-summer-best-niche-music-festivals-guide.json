Also party-time singalong favourites Hayseed Dixie, the Magic Numbers and the Mavericks.

Limited to 400 punters, in the grounds of Sparkford Hall, a Grade II listed Georgian mansion in Somerset, this is a giant, curated house party melding global sound-system culture and left-field visual art. The crowd: Likely to be populated by people who all sort of know each other \u2013 largely from an artsy, twentysomething demographic. The main events: The headline slot comes from UK carnival legend Aba Shanti-I, but you also need to catch rising Ugandan selector Kampire and trendy, eccentric Parisian hip-hop DJ Teki Latex. Look out for: DJ Bus Replacement Service, who is known for wearing a Kim Jong-un mask when she plays (obviously). Her sets have been called \u201cunhinged\u201d. What else? There\u2019s a boudoir-aesthetic space called the Love hotel \u2013 previously an art installation with film screenings; it\u2019s now seemingly a whole area. Camping is free, with a limited number of hotel rooms for tent-phobes. Try this if you like: Experimental festivals like Unsound in Poland, CTM in Berlin or Notting Hill carnival sound systems in London.

AK Houghton festival Houghton Hall, King\u2019s Lynn, Norfolk, 8-11 Aug The vibe A woodland hideaway featuring everything electronic from Detroit techno to Chicago house, footwork and drum\u2019n\u2019bass, curated by longtime Fabric resident Craig Richards. The crowd LSD-microdosing 90s ravers meet university students on summer break. See the performers pop up in the crowd and expect glitter, faux fur and bucket hats. The main events House pioneer Derrick Carter plays a rare disco set, while Four Tet\u2019s luscious ambient sounds counter the industrial force of the likes of DJ Stingray. Look out for\u2026 The man with perhaps the best name (and selection of rare electro) in the game, Intergalactic Gary; trumpeter Matthew Halsall; rising techno producer Bruce. What else? At a festival with a 24-hour music licence, making time for some wellness is key. Houghton has a selection of yoga classes, a woodland sauna, and even a massage parlour on site.

Look out for\u2026 Rising electro-popper Charlotte Adig\u00e9ry, returning post-punkers Maximum Joy and party selectors from Worldwide FM \u2013 it\u2019s not just improv jamming that\u2019s catered for here. What else? East London gem Brawn is one of the gourmet restaurants on site. They\u2019ll be serving snacks and natural wine till late, which means you might end up not seeing much music after all. Try this if you like\u2026 Arguing over whether A Love Supreme is superior to The Shape of Jazz to Come and settling it via dance-off. KH Beautiful Days Escot Park, Devon, 16-18 Aug The vibe A late 80s folk-punk Glastonbury, plus kids: this is the festival run by the Levellers, all grown up.

The crowd Don\u2019t let the men with black T-shirts, lumber jackets and stern looks fool you: this is a fest for feminist math-rockers, sensitive moshers, craft ale appreciators and anyone with a beard. The main events Big-haired shredders Coheed and Cambria and \u201cblack metal bluesman\u201d Zeal &amp; Ardor will play on Friday; Battles, Russian Circles and 65DaysOfStatic provide expansive noise on Saturday. Look out for\u2026 Cocaine Piss, Mammoth Weed Wizard Bastard, Colossal Squid and plenty more bands who sound like they picked their name from a Cards Against Humanity randomiser. What else? ArcTanGent is more music-focused than most \u2013 the closest it gets to gentrified festival fare is local beer and glamping options \u2013 but it does offer a late-night silent disco till 3am. Try this if you like\u2026 Whiplash and more time-signature changes than there are portable toilets.
