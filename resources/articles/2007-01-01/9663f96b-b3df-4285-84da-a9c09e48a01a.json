He helps everyone he looks upon to fulfil their dreams, turning a cowardly teenager into a dangerous gangster, making a crime boss's loser son into a winner, liberating a Catholic priest into becoming a drag performer, and so on. It ends tragically and is as painfully hypnotic as watching a religious zealot ranting in the street and carrying a banner proclaiming the second coming."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
