Hughie, who expects to fight Joseph Parker for his WBO heavyweight crown in the spring, says the Furys believe they will emulate the Klitschko brothers, Vitali and Wladimir, by holding two versions of the heavyweight title each at the same time. \u201cTyson is in a better place now and hopefully he will be back this year,\u201d said Hughie. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame what happened but he should be back and hopefully regaining his titles. He says he has been ticking over, doing a few runs with his family. Hopefully he will get his head screwed on and come back stronger. \u201cThe dream is for both of us to rule the heavyweight division; that is what I\u2019ve always wanted. Hopefully Tyson can get his arse back in gear then we can do it. The plan is when Tyson comes back we get the belts, every one of them.\u201d Hughie will soon get the chance to begin the process by defeating the big\u2011hitting Parker and says he is determined to bring the WBO belt, previously owned by Tyson, back into the family. \u201cTyson was the one who broke all them belts loose for everyone to pick up, and I\u2019m going to bring them back, one at a time. \u201cParker is one of the best at the minute in the heavyweight division, so I\u2019m not going to take him for granted, but I\u2019m pretty confident.\u201d However, Hughie has revealed for the first time that he has been having his own health problems because of a rare type of acne that left him physically wiped out and was so bad it left his sheets stained with blood every night. \u201cI\u2019ve not been at 100% for my last few fights,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had issues, my body has been really bad. Basically it was a rare type of acne called acne conglobata and it poisoned my immune system. \u201cI only found out after the Fred Kassi fight last April. I\u2019ve had it for all my fights and it was getting worse and worse. I went to see a specialist in Harley Street and he said the type of acne I had used to put people in hospital beds in the olden days. That\u2019s how bad it was. The skin specialist said to me \u2018I can\u2019t believe you have been fighting in this condition\u2019.\u201d He added: \u201cThere were times when I wanted to quit boxing altogether. It\u2019s been every single training camp I have had, because I was so tired. \u201cThere was one stage I couldn\u2019t even lift my hands up. My dad sent me home, he said \u2018What\u2019s the point of being in the gym?\u2019 Even a 10kg weight I couldn\u2019t get off my chest. I had to look in the mirror and ask \u2018Where am I going next? How am I going to fight good fighters when you are only 30-40%?\u2019 It was pointless.\u201d Fury also said that the acne caused him to have body confidence issues as well as questions from people over whether he was using performance-enhancing drugs. \u201cIt was horrific,\u201d he said. \u201cI would try a shirt on and it would be covered in blood all the time. It was painful \u2013 every time I sparred my T-shirt would be soaked with blood, coming from my chest, coming from my back. You can even see it from some of the videos from my fights, it\u2019s pumping out of my back. I was in a bad state. \u201cSome people thought I was on steroids, but if it was I would be a bit better muscled,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019d have these Popeye muscles like these other heavyweights. I\u2019ve always been lean.\u201d However, Fury said that he now felt \u201c100%\u201d better after being treated with Roacutane. \u201cThe medication was quite hard, because I was always tired and sleeping all the time, but I got through it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt made all the skin soft as well, so I had to toughen that up. If I would have taken a jab to the face I would have been cut. My skin cleared up a couple of months ago and it has not come back.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
