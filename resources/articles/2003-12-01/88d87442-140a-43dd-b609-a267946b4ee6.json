There's always one person you buy smellies for - not because they pong, but because they like that sort of thing (hopefully), or because you can't think of anything else to give. Even people who would consider a quick rub down with a bar of coal tar soap a \"beauty routine\" tend to find themselves buying the odd bath thing around this time of year. \"Our bath oil sales will go up by 500% in the week before the big day,\" says Antony Buck, co-founder of REN, which specialises in bath products. But put away thoughts of buying auntie the same old lavender bubble bath and surprise her with something from the new fleet of treats for the tub. First up is the trend for floating flowers. In Bali, women prepare for their wedding with a ritual called Lulur, which involves bathing in a pool of floating flowers. This ritual has inspired The Sanctuary's Oriental Floral Spa Bath (\u00a37.95, Boots), a pot of crystals and dried flowers. If you have someone to share a bath with, this makes for a romantic setting; but, on a day-to-day basis, it's annoying to spend hours retrieving petals from your nooks and crannies. So you might want to go for Calmia's delicious Lulur Blossom Bath (\u00a325, 020-7224 3585) containing oil of ylang ylang, a flower used in Lulur. Meanwhile, classic oils such as lavender are being replaced by refreshing citrus and floral blends - Cath Collins' Ginger Lily and Lemon Bath Essence (\u00a319.50, 01803 813064) is the best. It smells gorgeous and makes a great gift accompaniment to a bottle of Gordon's gin. Beauty anoraks will know that, earlier this year, Shiseido launched a cream called Body Creator, which claims to \"eat\" cellulite via caffeine and nerve-stimulating fragrances. These ingredients are now available in a bath milk (Body Creator Aromatic Bath Essence, \u00a348, 020-7630 1515). The firming effect wasn't as dramatic as with the cream, but this way of applying it is much more fun. Willing, but non-rubbery, yoga fans will love Post-Yoga Bath from Mysteries (\u00a36.99, 020-7240 3688), a cream of muscle-softening juniper, cypress and rosemary. It's also a treat pre-practice to make your muscles twice as game. Let's not forget the ubiquitous good-enough-to-eat products. In case of withdrawal symptoms when taking a break from eating to bathe, there are endless new foodie products. Simply Roses' Rose Truffles (\u00a317.95, 020-7700 5566) are balls of shea butter and rose oil lined up in a box like sweets. Marks &amp; Spencer's Chocolat du Bain Foaming Bath Melt (\u00a37) looks and smells like chocolate milkshake. But the ultimate is Coco de Mer Cocofesse (\u00a315, 020-7836 8882), a milk powder that would surely have been Cleopatra's favourite, were she shopping today. Finally, the woman who deserves the best should get REN's limited edition (there are only 200) 1.1 litre bottle of Moroccan Rose Otto Bath Oil (0845 22 55 600). It's expensive - \u00a3135, to be precise - but then it does contain the oil of 300,000 rose petals."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
