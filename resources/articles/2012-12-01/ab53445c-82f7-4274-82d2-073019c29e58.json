Revealing a first-half loss of \u00a336.1m, its chief executive, Trevor Moore, said tough trading conditions meant there were \"material uncertainties facing the business\". He insisted closing stores or putting the retailer in administration was not currently \"part of our plan\" but said he was seeking to cut running costs. \"I joined the group because I believe it has a strong future,\" he said. \"If I thought we had tried everything I would not have joined.\" HMV, famous for its Nipper the dog mascot, banks all its profit at Christmas. Analysts had previously pencilled in \u00a310m for this year but Moore said dire summer sales meant its performance would now fall short of City estimates. Like-for-like sales slumped 10% in the six months to 27 October after suppliers held back new titles for fear they would be overlooked as the nation focused on a summer of sport. The warning sent HMV's shares into freefall, closing down nearly 40%, at 2.49p, giving the retailer a stock market value of around \u00a310m. The retailer, which remains burdened with a \u00a3176m debt despite having sold off the Waterstones chain and its live music venues to raise cash, said it was \"probable\" it would breach its banking covenants when they were tested in January. A breach would put the banks in the driving seat and could result in their calling in their loans. The company said it would be able to meet a \u00a330m payment due then and had \"adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future\", adding it was \"currently operating within\" the terms of its \u00a3220m banking facility. The fresh financial crunch is a setback for Moore, who with finance director Ian Kenyon joined the retailer in September. HMV had been struggling for several years as music downloads and internet rivals contributed to a sharp fall in demand for physical CDs, DVDs and games on the high street and the update echoed a similarly bleak warning made last December. HMV was thought to be out of the woods after it handed equity to suppliers, including Universal Music, EMI, Warner Brothers and Disney, at the start of this year in exchange for improved commercial terms. The deal gave HMV better access to music and film suppliers' back catalogues and has enabled it to buy stock on consignment, meaning it only pays for products if it sells them. As the last remaining nationwide music and DVD specialist, a collapse of HMV could be more financially damaging for film companies and record labels than for the group's shareholders as internet retailers such as Amazon chip away at their profit margins. Despite its weak financial performance HMV commands a 38% share of the physical music market and a 27% share for DVDs and Blu-Ray. With the markets for physical CDs and DVDs in sharp decline the previous management team led by Simon Fox had scaled back the UK chain to 247 stores and moved aggressively into selling popular gadgets such as iPads, MP3 players and headphones to shore up sales. Although sales of games and technology were the one bright spot, with growth of 6%, demand was \"not as strong as the business had believed it would be\", said Moore. Seymour Pierce analyst Freddie George said HMV faced \"potentially insurmountable structural issues\" and he was not convinced that the actions being taken by the retailer were enough to counter structural pressures on its core entertainment markets."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
