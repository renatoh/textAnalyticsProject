Well over 120,000 people took to the streets of cities all across the United States on Saturday, to protest president Donald Trump and his agenda. The march was scheduled to mark the anniversary of Trump\u2019s first tumultuous year in office, and happened to coincide with a government shutdown, itself the result of failed negotiations between the president and a Republican-controlled Congress. Speakers exhorted women to run for office in in Washington DC, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Chicago and elsewhere, and to maintain pressure on policy issues such as healthcare, reproductive rights and climate change. They also linked the movement to the #MeToo movement, encouraging women to stand together and speak out against sexual assault and harassment. Protesters broke out their most creative signs, including one that read \u201cYou Know It\u2019s Bad When a White Middle Aged Man Living In The Napa Valley Is Marching\u201d and another reading \u201cI\u2019ve Seen Better Cabinets At Ikea\u201d. In Los Angeles, speakers linked the issues of immigration, sexual assault and gender equality, launching into an Obama-era chant of \u201csi se puede\u201d. Among the speakers was Viola Davis, who said: \u201cEvery single day your job as an American citizen is not just to fight for your rights, it\u2019s to fight for the right of every individual that is taking a breath, whose heart is pumping and breaking on this earth.\u201d Trump tweeted: \u201ca perfect day for all Women to March. Get out there now to celebrate the historic milestones and unprecedented economic success and wealth creation that has taken place over the last 12 months. Lowest female unemployment in 18 years!\u201d Leaders in Congress bickered and tried to blame each other for the shutdown, with no resolution in sight between various factions, including hardline anti-immigration advisers in the White House. By early evening, Republicans in the House were voting on whether a chart there broke the rules. The president canceled plans to go to a party in south Florida, meant to celebrate his first year in office, and remained in Washington DC. An adviser to New York mayor Bill de Blasio has one of the first city estimates for crowd sizes on Manhattan. A few people came out. Marches on the east coast are winding down in a mood of solidarity and renewed purpose to oppose Donald Trump\u2019s agenda, which is currently paralyzed in Washington DC, where Congress and the White House can\u2019t agree on how to fund the government. The funding shutdown is the first in four years, and the first in American history to occur when one party controls the White House and both chambers of Congress. Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress spent most of Saturday flinging blame at each other for the shutdown, which has already furloughed hundreds of thousands of government workers. Democratic senator Chuck Schumer said trying to talk to the president was like \u201cnegotiating with jello\u201d. Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell said that Schumer had led the charge \u201cplunging our country into this 100% avoidable mess\u201d. Democratic minority leader Nancy Pelosi said Congress needed find long-term solutions for programs on children\u2019s healthcare and young undocumented people. Republican representative Paul Ryan said Democrats were holding the country \u201chostage\u201d to these demands. According to reporters on the Capitol, including the Guardian\u2019s Ben Jacobs, backroom deliberations are not going much better. The White House has at least two hardline voices on immigration, chief of staff John Kelly and adviser Stephen Miller, who are pressing for funding for a border wall and limits to protecting young immigrants. Republicans need to wrangle fiscal conservatives and anti-immigration hawks such as Tom Cotton, who tried to torpedo a bipartisan plan last week. With a slim majority in the Senate, they also need to win over at least a faction of Democrats to reach 60 votes necessary for a spending bill. If the Senate can somehow manage these negotiations with some hope of Trump\u2019s signature, they then have to count on Ryan to schedule a vote in the far more raucous and conservative House. Through all of this, the president has canceled plans to go to his south Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, where he had intended to have a party celebrating the anniversary of his inauguration. Creative signage from around the country. In Los Angeles, Carla Green reports that the bulk of the protesters have now gathered across the street from city hall, which has been fenced off for the occasion. There are speakers and performers on a giant stage, and lines of food trucks and portapotties nearby. About half a mile further south, Reggie Washington stands at the intersection of 7th and Broadway with a cardboard sign excoriating Trump, and asking for \u201chelp\u201d. Washington is one of an estimated 58,000 people who are homeless in Los Angeles county. He grew up here - in Watts - but he\u2019s been living in a tent downtown for the past couple months. Washington said he marched in the Women\u2019s March last year. This year, in the hour he\u2019d been out asking for money, nobody had even stopped to talk to him. \u201cI say please, but they walk right by like they don\u2019t even see you,\u201d he said Sarah Betancourt is reporting from the rally at Cambridge, Massachusetts, near Boston. \u201cAny attempt to dismantle Roe v Wade is unconstitutional,\u201d said Kayla Briere, an aide to Congresswoman Elizabeth Esty (CT-05). Briere was one of two women dressed as Handmaids at the Boston Womens\u2019 March. Fellow handmaid Cindy Sershen is a nurse practioner in Cambridge. She told the Guardian, \u201cI could never deny a patient the right to speak for their own body.\u201d Briere said they are wearing outfits reminiscent of the Margaret Atwood bestseller \u201cHandmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d because, \u201c\u201dit represents women\u2019s reproductive rights.\u201d They cited recent Texas abortion restrictions as reasons for why the issue is important. Sarah Betancourt is reporting from the rally at Cambridge, Massachusetts, near Boston. Holding signs with messages varying from \u201cHow to Grab a Pussy,\u201d to \u201cWe R Still Here,\u201d to \u201cLittle girls with dreams become women with vision,\u201d thousands flocked to Cambridge Common near Harvard Square for the Boston-area Womens\u2019 March. High school senior Prachi Jhawar, 17, said she was out there so her voice can be heard, even if she can\u2019t vote yet. Her sign (Hey Trump, Liberty and Justice for All,\u201d included a long list of groups, like DREAMers, Muslims, and refugees. A daughter of Indian immigrants, Jhawar is looking forward to school at American University next fall. \u201cI want to be a politician one day,\u201d she said. \u201cThese aren\u2019t partisan issues. They are human rights issues,\u201d she said, adding that she is a part of a human rights club that raised money for immigrant rights attorneys. More from Carla Green, reporting from the march in Los Angeles. There\u2019s lots of free swag and food to be had at the protest if you know where to find it. There\u2019s a company is handing out granola bars taped to promotional cards, there are people handing out donut holes with the slogan \u201cdonut holes not shitholes\u201d, and Vice Media\u2019s VICELAND has made branded bandanas and buttons. One woman sporting a VICELAND bandana, Jazmin, said she liked the channel\u2019s \u201cedgy content\u201d and had even done some marketing work for them, but hadn\u2019t watched much of their programming. Jazmin hadn\u2019t heard about the allegations of sexual harassment, assault, and sexism lodged against Vice Media in a recent New York Times expos\u00e9. But she wasn\u2019t surprised. \u201cIt\u2019s the whole industry,\u201d she said. In Los Angeles, Carla Green has spoken with marchers moving into downtown Los Angeles, where a number of celebrities, including Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson and Viola Davis, are in attendance. Thousands of protesters have descended into downtown Los Angeles, sometimes marching shoulder to shoulder across four-lane streets. Kathy Sovich, 61, had menstrual pads stuck to her head with the message \u201cI will not go quietly back to the 50\u2019s\u201d in red ink. She was visiting from Colorado, and had missed the march last year. \u201cBut I\u2019ve always hated Trump,\u201d she said. Another protester nearby chimed in: \u201camen!\u201d Sovich said she couldn\u2019t remember the last protest she went to, or what, exactly, it was for. \u201cSomething pro-environment,\u201d she said. She\u2019s marching today because she doesn\u2019t trust Trump, she said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t speak the truth, he doesn\u2019t care about the American people, and his ideas are for the benefit of large corporations and himself,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t like anything about him except that he doesn\u2019t drink alcohol.\u201d Actor Viola Davis has just delivered a speech to marchers in Los Angeles, tying together the anti-Trump protests to the Me Too movement that has given women courage to speak out about sexual assault and harassment inflicted by powerful men. Davis says that she wants Americans to remember \u201cthe women who are faceless, who don\u2019t have the money, and don\u2019t have the constitution, and don\u2019t have the confidence. And don\u2019t have the images in our media that give them a sense of self-worth to break the silence, a silence that s rooted in the shame of assault, in the stigma of assault.\u201d She says these women are \u201cyearning to breathe free, to breathe free\u201d. \u201cEvery single day your job as an American citizen is not just to fight for your rights, it\u2019s to fight for the right of every individual that is taking a breath, whose heart is pumping and breaking on this earth.\u201d Marches are on the move in cities on both coasts and everywhere in between, the AP reports. Oklahoma City protesters are chanting \u201cWe need a leader, not a creepy tweeter!\u201d with one woman donning a T-shirt with the likeness of social justice icon Woody Guthrie who wrote \u201cThis Land Is Your Land.\u201d Members of the group Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women of Seattle are burning sage and chanting in front of Seattle\u2019s rainy march. In Richmond, Virginia, the crowd burst into cheers when a woman ran down the middle of the street carrying a pink flag with the word \u201cResist.\u201d Several hundred people have gathered in Palm Beach, Florida, carrying anti-Donald Trump signs as they prepare to march near the president\u2019s Mar-a-Lago home on Florida\u2019s east coast. A group of women wearing red cloaks and white hats like the characters in the book and TV show \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d marched in formation Saturday, their heads bowed. Two women dressed as handmaids \u2013 from the novel and TV series A Handmaid\u2019s Tale, about a misogynistic dystopian America \u2013 appear in Philadelphia. They turned out in south Florida, too, near the president\u2019s private resort, Mar-a-Lago. He has called off his plans to travel there this weekend due to the failure by the White House and Congress to avert a government shutdown. In Houston, hundreds have marched in more traditional wear (and plenty of pink hats). Lauren Gambino is reporting from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, where a few people have ventured onto the semi-frozen reflecting pool. Photos from around the US, starting in Washington. \u2026 New York \u2026 \u2026 Los Angeles \u2026 \u2026 and Chicago. The president has commented on the protests against him. Carla Green is with the march in Los Angeles, where the streets are awash in pink hats and homemade signs. When protesters first arrive at the Women\u2019s March in downtown LA, they\u2019re greeted by shouting vendors selling merchandise - buttons and pink \u201cpussy hats\u201d and branded scarfs. By midday, Spanish chants of \u201csi se puede\u201d \u2013 \u201cyes we can\u201d \u2013 were moving through the crowds. One vendor, Walter Lopez, said he woke up at 3 AM to get here from Redondo Beach. He\u2019s on unpaid leave from his work as a warehouse supervisor, and found a listing on Craigslist offering to provide all the materials and a percentage of the profits. He\u2019s working at bartender gig tonight. Lopez wasn\u2019t at the march last year, and almost didn\u2019t come this year - it was cold when he woke up, he says. But he\u2019s glad he came. \u201cI\u2019m impressed by how many people showed up,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m all about women; people; human beings. It\u2019s a good thing I woke up.\u201d A couple thousand people are milling about at the starting point for the march, but it\u2019s nothing like the 750,000-person crowd that throttled downtown Los Angeles this time last year - at least, not yet. Sarah Park, 26, was at last year\u2019s march - and has noticed the difference. \u201cThere\u2019s more of a community feel - but there are also way less people,\u201d she says, laughing. She came, in part, to protest the Trump administration\u2019s push to repeal DACA, which would affect one of her best friends. \u201cThat\u2019s why I brought her with me today,\u201d Park said. Park feels less enraged than she did last year, but says Trump is \u201cstill doing shithole work\u201d. Adam Gabbatt is with the march through downtown Manhattan, talking with protesters against the Trump administration. Thousands of people are now marching through Manhattan. The main streets on the west and south of Central Park have been closed off and the roads are a sea of signs and pink hats. The march started just after 1pm, led by a group of people in electric wheelchairs. Behind them the beat of drums is echoing off the skyscrapers. \u201cHey hey, ho ho, Donald Trump has got to go,\u201d is being chanted with gusto. Blythe Nobleman, a 56-year-old university professor from Hoboken, New Jersey, is among the marchers. Like many people here, Nobleman\u2019s homemade sign has been inspired by Trump\u2019s recent \u201cshithole\u201d comments. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s a good human being,\u201d Nobleman said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m very open minded so it takes a lot for me to reach that conclusion.\u201d Nobleman didn\u2019t march last year - something she said she deeply regrets - but she felt compelled to be here today. \u201cI\u2019m enraged about daca. I have taught hundreds of daca students over the years. They grew up here like anyone else - they are Americans. They didn\u2019t just slither over the border to take up illegal residence here.\u201d Over the sound of the vehement drumming - provided 40 women from Batala NYC, a Brazilian-inspired percussion ensemble - Nobleman said : \u201cWe actually to be very affirmative about voting and participating in governments. \u201cThe midterms are a start but I think it\u2019s going to be years now before we can remedy all of the problems caused by this administration.\u201d Tens of thousands of women are in the streets of Philadelphia, Washington DC and Chicago, Dallas, Atlanta and Denver. Congress appears to be at a complete standstill over the shutdown. Ben Jacobs is at the Capitol, where Democratic leader recently compared talks to \u201cnegotiating with jello\u201d and then gave a press conference. \u201cIt\u2019s next to impossible to reach a deal with president because he can\u2019t stick to the terms, I found this out, Leader McConnell found this out, Speaker Ryan has found this out,\u201d Schumer told reporters. He then compared the president and Republican leaders in Congress to Abbott and Costello, the slapstick comedy duo from the 1940s. In Washington DC, Lauren Gambino is reporting from the mall, where reporters have gathered round the semi-frozen reflecting pool. And near where female scientists are gathering as a cohort of the larger protest. Tens of thousands are marching in New York, starting on the western side of Central Park and heading downtown. The Washington Mall, stretching from the obelisk to the Lincoln Memorial, has thousands of women, many wearing pink hats, ready to march. New York is a mirror image on the street, framed by canyons of buildings down Broadway and the avenues. As Republican and Democratic leaders blame each other for the government shutdown, with mass protests against the Trump administration right outside their door, the White House makes a statement. \u201cThe president will not negotiate on immigration reform until Democrats stop playing games and reopen the government,\u201dpress secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. The Democratic leader in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, met with Trump on Friday. On Saturday, he gave a riposte from the Senate floor: There is none of the mutual acrimony among protesters on the streets of major American cities. They\u2019ve reserved it for the president, with chants that include: \u201cWe want a leader not a creepy tweeter.\u201d \u201cWhose shutdown? Trump shutdown.\u201d \u201cMy body, my choice.\u201d There are already tens of thousands in the streets of New York, Philadelphia, Washington and Los Angeles. The Republican leader of the House, Paul Ryan, is now giving a speech from the floor of the chamber to denounce Democrats \u2013 a tit-for-tat reply to the blame that the minority party just threw at the majority party\u2019s feet. Ryan quotes several Democrats at length, including their Senate leader, Chuck Schumer, who in 2013 criticized Republicans for causing the last government shutdown. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t hold millions of people hostage,\u201d Ryan quotes Schumer. \u201cThat\u2019s what the other side is doing, that\u2019s what wrong, and we can\u2019t give into that.\u201d He moves into his own speech. \u201cAs we speak, furlough notices are going to thousands of federal employees,\u201d Ryan says. \u201cHalf of the defense department\u2019s civilian workforce has been furloughed. \u201cAll of this, all of this is completely unnecessary. But Senate democrats believe none of it is too high a price to pay for appeasing their political base.\u201d Ryan insists that Republicans \u201chave been and remain willing to work together in good faith on immigration.\u201d Last week, during a meeting at the White House, the president dashed hopes for a bipartisan plan to protect undocumented young people. Democrats have opposed funding for a border wall but said they would be open to border security measures. \u201cThere is no good reason for seven democrats to keep willfully forcing a shutdown on this country,\u201d Ryan says. \u201cStop holding our troops and children\u2019s health insurance hostage.\u201d The children\u2019s health program (Chip) ran out of money on 30 September 2017, since when the Republican-controlled Congress has declined to renew funding. \u201cCome to your senses, do the right thing, let this government open back up,\u201d Ryan concludes. Adam Gabbatt is talking with protesters in New York City, where thousands are gathering on the Upper West Side, at 71st Street and Columbus Avenue, before marching downtown. The streets on the west side of Central Park are packed with thousands of people as the women\u2019s march prepares to take place. One of the closest subway stations to the start of the march is at Columbus Circle - which happens to be right by Trump International Hotel and Tower. Lots of people are posing for pictures in front of the Trump sign,including Deborah Paray and Marteen Dinzes, both from New Jersey. They\u2019ve fashioned a sign depicting Donald Trump with a large hole for a mouth. \u201cA lot of shit comes out of that hole,\u201d Dinzes said. Both women were at the march in New York City last year - Dinzes is wearing a pin commemorating that event - but they said today\u2019s event is more than just an anti-Trump demonstration. \u201cAlong with this march it\u2019s also about voting. We\u2019ve got to make sure as many people are registered as possible,\u201d Paray said. Tens of thousands of people are expected to march here from 12.30pm. They won\u2019t be heading past Trump\u2019s former/future home of Trump Tower, but it will be pretty close - close enough for the president to take notice when he sees this on tv. Democrats are giving a press conference on the current state of shutdown talks, and have denounced Republicans in control of the White House and Congress. \u201cThey have proven that they are incapable of the most basic functions of government such as keeping the lights on,\u201d says Representative Linda Sanchez. \u201cHow can we trust them to face the many challenges our country faces?\u201d Then the minority leader in the House, representative Nancy Pelosi, says that Democrats are frustrated with the repeated short term \u201ccontinuing resolutions\u201d that do not provide long-term solutions to programs, such as protections for undocumented young people or children\u2019s healthcare. \u201cWe are willing to go to a short-term CR if we are willing to come to a conclusion and an agreement on parity,\u201d Pelosi says, primarily on the deferred deportation program (Daca) and more border security. \u201cIt\u2019s not only about defense it\u2019s about transportation, it\u2019s about education, it\u2019s about all our needs.\u201d Another House leader, Steny Hoyer, says that Democrats have never wanted a shutdown but that \u201cthis incompetent leadership has not sent one appropriation bill to the president\u201d. Another Democrat echoes that point: \u201clet\u2019s not continue to lurch from one CR to the next.\u201d Pelosi alludes to a May tweet Trump wrote saying, \u201cOur country needs a good \u2018shutdown\u2019 in September to fix mess!\u201d \u201cHappy anniversary Mr President, your wish came true,\u201d Pelosi says. \u201cYou won the shutdown. The shutdown is all yours.\u201d The marches begin in New York, Denver and Philadelphia. While senators and representatives debate how to keep the federal government, hundreds of thousands of Americans are suddenly on furlough, without any idea of when they might get back to work or back to receiving a paycheck. Jamiles Lartey interviewed some of them. Amad Ali joined the marines after 9/11, believing he would fight the terrorists who attacked the US. He wound up in Iraq instead, disillusioned, fighting in a \u201cconjured-up\u201d conflict. \u201cA lot of us didn\u2019t make it back and a lot of us \u2013 like myself \u2013 didn\u2019t come back the same,\u201d he said on Friday. \u201cSo yes, feeling duped by the federal government is something that I can relate to.\u201d Ali is now an employee of the Social Security Administration, in Indiana. He remains disheartened by the way the government treats the people he works with: in this case, federal employees facing an unpaid furlough if the government shuts down. \u201cWe do feel that we are used as pawns and bargaining chips in the overall political process,\u201d said Ali, who is also executive vice-president of a local federal government workers union. Sabrina is a 23-year veteran of the National Parks Service who works in Washington DC, which, with its proliferation of memorials, has the highest concentration of national parks in the country. Sabrina has been sent home on furlough three times before. The last was in 2013. \u201cFinancially it\u2019s going to take a toll on me,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of savings. I just put a daughter through college.\u201d Federal employees are typically discouraged from discussing shutdowns. Sabrina asked that her identity be changed, to avoid any repercussions from doing so. \u201cAll of us, we depend on that check,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of these people are your middle class, and they\u2019re check to check. Whenever we have shutdowns we feel like we\u2019re always forgotten.\u201d Talks are not going well in Congress, according to Politico\u2019s Kyle Cheney. Representative Raul Grijalva, a Democrat from Arizona, told Cheney that a leading Senate Democrat, Dick Durbin, was \u201cclose to a deal\u201d with the Republican majority leader, Mitch McConnell \u2013 and that it fell through after a call from the Republican leader of the House. \u201cThey were close to a deal and then Ryan made a call and didn\u2019t want anything on immigration,\u201d Grijalva told Cheney. Meanwhile, protesters are gathering on the mall for a march that will head toward the Capitol and the White House. A year ago, Sarah Stankorb left her home in Cincinnati to join the women\u2019s march on Washington. When she returned, talking about more activism with her friends, the topic of a run for city council arose. Her friends pointed at her, she writes for the Guardian. Me? I felt uncomfortable with the idea of sweeping into a spotlight. I have spasmodic dysphonia, a neurological disorder, which makes my voice shaky \u2013 not great for speaking in public. But in this time of uncertainty, I began to feel like I\u2019d sleep better at night if I were more involved. \u201cYou should run,\u201d women I respect told me. They convinced me. Among people outside my home, it was the women who showed up with the most tenacity \u2013 hosting events, carrying campaign literature around in their purses and talking their neighbors into voting for me. They coached me on getting over the awkwardness of touting my achievements. They amplified everything I did. Whatever doubts I\u2019d had about running in the first place, they pounded it out of me with their sheer insistence that I must win. On election night, in a race where the top seven would win seats, I climbed to third. A friend who\u2019d been with me throughout, also won a seat. In many ways, she and I had taken the plunge together. We had believed in each other. In December, I was sworn in. I wore a suffragette white dress under a blue blazer, with my grandmother\u2019s brooch pinned to the lapel. My family, my team, were in the audience. I repeated the oath to uphold the constitution and our city\u2019s charter. I bound myself to a duty I\u2019d always vaguely acknowledged, but after a year of fighting against an onslaught of bad choices and straight injustice, those words became sacred. I\u2019d found my voice, and so did many others. Lauren Gambino is in Washington DC to report on developments at the Capitol and on the mall. She reported earlier this week on the question facing the women\u2019s march movement: what next? \u201cWe started 2017 with perpetual outrage and now we are at the moment when we have perpetual outrage, plus a plan in place for 2018,\u201d Linda Sarsour, a co-chair of the Women\u2019s March, told the Guardian. Sarsour said reclaiming liberal majorities in the House and Senate is the best \u2013 and only \u2013 way to stop Trump\u2019s agenda. The Women\u2019s March intends to endorse female and progressive candidates in 2018, and to partner with local organizations to register new voters and increase engagement. \u201cOne year ago, we had millions of people marching in the streets of the streets,\u201d she said. \u201cThe idea is that we march the same people and their families and their friends to the polls in 2018.\u201d The group will meet in Las Vegas later this year. In October, thousands of women attended a convention in Detroit, attending trainings sessions for candidates and others on coalition building and countering white supremacy. It also paved the way, organizers believe, for the #MeToo moment, a social upswell in which women have come forward to share experiences of sexual assault and harassment. Gwen Combs, an elementary school teacher in Little Rock, Arkansas, is one of the women hoping to bring a Democratic wave that topples Republicans from their majority in Congress. Combs spent much of the presidential election biting her tongue. Barred from discussing politics in the classroom, the teacher couldn\u2019t answer her students\u2019 questions about what a Trump presidency might mean for an immigrant parent or a minority classmate. After the election, she was demoralized and couldn\u2019t stop thinking about her students. \u201cIt moved me. It moved me to want to make a safer world for these kids,\u201d she said. Like hundreds of thousands of other women, Combs stumbled on a Facebook group for a massive march on Washington. She couldn\u2019t afford a flight on short notice, so decided to organize one in Little Rock. She is now running for Arkansas\u2019s second congressional district. Hello and welcome to our rolling coverage of the second year of women\u2019s marches to protest Donald Trump and his agenda. The mass marches, planned all around the US for the anniversary of Trump\u2019s inauguration, have coincided with another milestone: the federal government largely shut down after midnight on Saturday, for the first time in four years. As the expiry clock ticked to midnight, the White House and factions of Democrats and Republicans in the Republican-controlled Congress failed to agree on a funding bill to keep the government open. The result is furlough for hundreds of thousands of government employees; an interruption of medical trials and scientific research; and one million active-duty military personnel who will serve without pay until the shutdown ends.
