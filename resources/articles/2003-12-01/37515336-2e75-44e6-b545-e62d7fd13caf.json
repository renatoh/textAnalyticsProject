I hope the good will outweigh the bad.\" William Taubman does not find it easy to say which way the scales should eventually tip. After almost two decades of work on his exceptionally well-researched book, he found himself sharing both the \"special affection\" and the \"special disdain\" for Khrushchev that he encountered among his Russian friends. Khrushchev's evil acts were numerous. Although his hands were less drenched in blood than those of several other members of the Politburo, he could not have risen through the Communist party hierarchy in the 1930s had he not played by the rules of Stalin's game. Between 1938 and 1940, when Khrushchev was first secretary of the Communist party in Ukraine, there were more than 165,000 political arrests there; more than 50,000 of these victims met their deaths. If he had not found enough \"spies and saboteurs\", his own life would have been in jeopardy. Taubman charts Khruschev's rise from a poor peasant home and minimal schooling to the leadership of the Soviet Union. His father decided that it was time for him to leave school after only two years and to start work in the fields. The young Nikita, he said, could already count to 30 and he was never likely to have more than 30 roubles to add up. A combination of natural intelligence and the denial of outlets for his talents under the old regime made Khrushchev just the kind of person the Bolsheviks strove to recruit. He was a quick learner and prodigiously energetic. By the mid-30s he was first secretary of the Moscow Communist party and, along with his mentor, Lazar Kaganovich, largely responsible for pushing through the building of the Moscow metro. In fact, he claimed later to have spent 80% of his time in the tunnels of the metro and acquired a reputation for driving himself as hard as he did the construction crews. In 1938 Khrushchev moved to Kiev as Ukrainian first secretary, becoming at the same time a candidate member of the Politburo. Although he was often in Moscow, Ukraine was his main base until 1949, when he returned to Moscow for good. During the war he was frequently at the front. Even the deputy chief of staff, Marshal Vasilevsky, who later fell out with Khrushchev and was forced into retirement, described him as \"energetic, brave and constantly with the troops\", adding that he \"never sat around... but kept trying to see and talk to people, and I must admit those people liked him\". But his greatest achievement was still to come. After outmanoeuvring everyone else in the collective leadership that was formed after Stalin's death in 1953, he revitalised the Communist party and took the momentous decision of drawing attention, at the 20th party congress, to many of the horrendous crimes for which Stalin was responsible. It is true that Khrushchev exclusively attacked Stalin's persecution of Communist party members: it was not until the Gorbachev era that the purges of non-Communists rated official condemnation. But only a risk-taker such as Khrushchev, and one who had a bad conscience about the extent to which he had gone along with Stalin, would have dared challenge the beliefs of the overwhelming majority of party members. When far-reaching reform of the Soviet system was finally undertaken in the second half of the 80s, it was led by people who, as young party members in 1956, had been shocked by Khrushchev's revelations and described themselves as \"children of the 20th congress\". The decision to make such a speech was pushed through the Politburo against the more cautious judgment of a majority of his colleagues. In the words of Taubman: \"Khrushchev's speech... was the bravest and most reckless thing he ever did. The Soviet regime never fully recovered, and neither did he.\" It is important to note what Khrushchev did not say. He did not raise any questions about the nature of the political system that enabled Stalin and his associates to get away with their monstrous injustices. The fundamental faults of the system were left for others to analyse. Nevertheless, the spell had been broken. Western Communist parties suffered permanent damage. Revolution in Hungary, reform in Poland and the Prague Spring of 1968 all owed much to the 20th congress, as, ultimately, did the transformation of the Soviet Union a generation later. Taubman's book is by far the best and most thorough contribution to understanding Khrushchev's personality and politics ever written, but he is not always as sure-footed in discussing more recent political phenomena. It is an over-simplification to say that \"Gorbachev shared Khrushchev's naivete about the extent of the Soviet people's commitment to communism\". Even while he held the position of general secretary of the Soviet Communist party, Gorbachev himself ceased to be a Communist and increasingly embraced a social democratic conception of socialism; it was this that he believed corresponded with the aspirations of a majority of the Soviet people. More fundamentally, Taubman is misleading when, citing as his source an interview he conducted with a leading Russian pollster, he says that \"the only two periods of the 20th century that Russians evaluate positively are those associated with the last tsar, Nicholas II, and Nikita Khrushchev\". The point about such surveys is that they reflect changing views of the present. Thus, the most reliable polling data show that, whereas in 1994 33% of respondents held Khrushchev's period to be the best of the 20th century and 36% chose the Brezhnev era, by 1999 support for Khrushchev's time had dropped to 30%, whereas that for life under Brezhnev had risen to a remarkable 51%. Most professionally conducted surveys have, indeed, shown that it is the Brezhnev era that evokes most nostalgia among post-Soviet Russians, because, in retrospect, the second half of the 60s and the 70s are seen as years of stability and predictability compared with the terror and upheaval under Stalin, non-stop reorganisation under Khrushchev, reform and disintegration under Gorbachev, and new turmoil and social insecurity under Yeltsin. \u00b7 Archie Brown is professor of politics at Oxford University and author of The Gorbachev Factor (OUP)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
