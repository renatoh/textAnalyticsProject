Herb Kohler, part-architect, whole owner of Whistling Straits golf club, venue of this week's US PGA Championship, is one of the richest men in America and, therefore, one of the most powerful. Offend him at your peril. Particularly this week, for over the next few days a proud Kohler will present for the inspection of the best players in the world the golf course of his dreams. In six years the land has been transformed from a combination of military airfield and toxic-waste site to one of the most photogenic courses in the world. It took many millions to do it, plus the imagination and inventiveness of Kohler and the architect Pete Dye, but once the magnate had decided that it would be done, it as good as was. Kohler is an extraordinary man. He has taken that northern England expression \"where there's muck there's brass\" and applied it to the whole of the US. He has become a toilet tycoon, a lord of the loos, a prince of porcelain, the Thomas Crapper of our times. He has built a billion-dollar company in the wilds of Wisconsin, his family have taken over a township called Riverbend and named it after themselves, and he has also killed a man. But more of that later. Kohler has built a vast fortune, but what do you do when the first few millions are safely in the bank? Well, what better than to play God, which is one definition of the job of the golf course architect. That is what Kohler chose to do and that is why Whistling Straits, on the shores of Lake Michigan, is this week's centre of the golfing universe. Kohler, an 18-handicap golf fanatic, has made frequent visits to the British Isles and was determined to have a links of his own. He loved the challenge of Ireland's Royal County Down and Royal Portrush, and Scotland's Cruden Bay, so he engaged Dye, a crusty traditionalist sometimes known as the Marquis de Sod, explained what he wanted and without more ado 13,126 truckloads of sand were brought in. It was spread all over the property to create a links feel and now no one knows exactly how many bunkers there are. It is said the entire greenkeeping staff set out one day to count them but, baffled by what constituted a bunker rather than apatch of sand, gave up when they got to 900. At least one of those bunkers is not where it was supposed to be. Dye had put a fairway bunker where he thought it should go but Kohler, a committee of one, thought it should be elsewhere. Neither gave an inch until, with both red in the face, Dye threw down a marker at a place marginally away from the preferred sites of both men. It was a piece of pragmatic peacekeeping. Kohler has also studied drama and when, at a celebrity competition, he met Kevin Costner and learned that the actor had studied business at college, the two became friends. One day Costner rang him and offered him a part in the film Open Range. \"Love to,\" said Kohler, \"but I want to ride a horse and I want to kill someone.\" Which is what, in a pivotal scene, he did. The result of the Dye-Kohler collaboration is certain to be controversial. \"If the wind blows you could lose a few players - not their balls, the players could fall right into the lake and die,\" says Mark Calcavecchia, the 1989 Open champion. \"On a couple of par threes bogey is going to be a good score. If it's windy it could turn into a joke. \"If the ball goes off the fairway you may not be able to find it and if you do you may not be able to get a club on it. As for the 18th green, whatever possessed a human being to design something like that I'll never know. There are six or seven holes that are just nasty.\" Ron Whitten, also a course architect, once said: \"It looks like a moonscape, but it's sure not the Sea of Tranquillity.\" Dye admits: \"I am sure there'll be controversy. If the wind blows, the fairways will dry out as hard as rock and there will be some bounces the guys won't like. But the greens are so big there'll be some low numbers posted. I think eight to 10 under will win.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
