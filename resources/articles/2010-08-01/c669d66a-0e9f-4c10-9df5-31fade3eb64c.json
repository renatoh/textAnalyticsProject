Villa have been inundated with applications since O'Neill quit as manager on Monday but the club are determined not to be rushed into a decision and are now prepared to let MacDonald remain in post for a couple of weeks, possibly even longer. MacDonald, the reserve-team manager, was given the job on a caretaker basis on Monday, when O'Neill handed in his resignation and caught everyone at Villa by surprise. Randy Lerner, the Villa chairman, flew into England the following morning to meet Paul Faulkner, the club's chief executive, to begin drawing up a shortlist and assessing the merits of those interested. However they have since come to the conclusion that the process could take some time. That decision is also a reflection of the absence of any outstanding candidates to choose from. Sven-Goran Eriksson has been installed as the new favourite but there has been no contact from Villa and sources close to the Swede have played down his chances. Mark Hughes and Martin Jol would both have been strong contenders but they look to be out of reach, leaving Villa with limited options. Lerner and Faulkner have faith in MacDonald to do the job in the meantime, with the former Republic of Ireland assistant certain to be in charge for Saturday's game against West Ham United and possibly both legs of the Europa League tie against Rapid Vienna and the Premier League match away at Newcastle in between. MacDonald is regarded as an excellent coach and is well respected by the players. As well as recruiting a new manager, Lerner has a number of other issues to address, including preventing Ashley Young from following O'Neill and James Milner out of the door. Faulkner is due to meet Young's representative tomorrow to discuss Villa's plans to keep the England international amid growing interest from Tottenham Hotspur. With Lerner today releasing a statement that suggested the days of heavy spending and huge wages are over, Villa find themselves in a difficult position with Young. The winger is the top-paid player at the club but tying him down to a longer contract \u2013 he has under two years remaining on his deal \u2013 would require them to increase his \u00a365,000-a-week salary and commit to paying the money over a longer period. That prospect will hardly appeal to an owner who has been keen to redress the balance between the salaries Villa are paying out and the money coming in. Yet, at the same time, Villa can ill-afford to lose one of their most influential players at a time when O'Neill has departed and Milner is about to join Manchester City. Villa would also want to avoid a situation where Young has just 12 months left on his contract next summer. Tottenham are monitoring events closely and hope to capitalise on the turmoil at Villa Park. Spurs would be in a position to entice Young with the prospect of playing in the Champions League but they would be reluctant to offer an increase on his salary at Villa because of the strict wage structure at White Hart Lane. The London club would also need to come up with a fee close to \u00a320m to persuade Villa to think about selling. Before committing his future to Villa, Young is likely to seek assurances about the club's ambitions, especially after Lerner's comments. The American talked about Villa being \"as competitive as possible given our size and resources\", which represented a change from his tone at the end of last season, when he said: \"The ambition and appetite to compete for the top-four spot and qualify for the Champions League is as alive as it's ever been.\" In his statement, Lerner admitted O'Neill and he \"no longer shared a common view as to how to move forward\" but refused to go into the reasons behind his sudden exit. \"To deal in greater detail would do little but cause additional distraction for the club as it faces imminent games and the clear priority of hiring a permanent manager,\" Lerner said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
