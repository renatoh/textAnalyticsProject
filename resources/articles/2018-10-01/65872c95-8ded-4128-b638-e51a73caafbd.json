Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s side travel to Manchester United on Saturday having collected only two points all season and their Slovakian goalkeeper has initiated what he regards as a potentially watershed get-together. \u201cI\u2019ve said to Jamaal [Lascelles, Newcastle\u2019s captain] that we need to arrange a meeting with all the players,\u201d Dubravka said in the wake of Newcastle\u2019s bitterly disappointing 2-0 home defeat by Leicester City on Saturday. \u201cI believe we have enough quality to beat teams like Leicester but we need to change something \u2013 we need to analyse everything and be honest with each other. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve done that until now. If we want to be successful, we need to change. You always have to give 100% because this is the Premier League; so I expect to see us putting in more. We have to react differently to going behind. Sometimes a players\u2019 meeting can help the team.\u201d With Mike Ashley, the club\u2019s owner, also said to be planning an unexpected, and unprecedented, \u201cclear the air\u201d dinner with Ben\u00edtez and the first-team squad this week it seems likely a lot of talking will be done on Tyneside in the coming days. Dubravka has been one of Newcastle\u2019s better performers but several teammates are underacheiving and the former Sparta Prague goalkeeper acknowledges morale is low. After all, Ben\u00edtez\u2019s side have lost their past four home games, scored four goals all season, never taken the lead, had the fewest shots in the Premier League and failed to assume more than 49% possession in any fixture. \u201cConfidence is not high right now,\u201d said Dubravka. \u201cWe have to sit down, all together and speak about which direction we need to go. We have to go in the same direction, every player. Everybody has to know which kind of system we play. Rafa has told us many times how we should do things but, against Leicester, we were a little bit confused in a few moments and we did not react well.\u201d Old Trafford is not always the ideal place for bright new dawns and Dubravka knows that, despite Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s present travails, Manchester United are unlikely to be pushovers. \u201cIt will be a tough game,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we have to bring the same attitude as when we beat them [at St James\u2019 Park] last season and do the same things. \u201cIt\u2019s no good just talking about things again and again. \u2026 If we want to change, we have to start it off by doing it ourselves. It is down to us, no one else. We need to be honest with each other. Of course, we need to stick together as a team but let\u2019s have this meeting and talk.\u201d Ashley is sufficiently concerned to have attended the past two matches in person \u2013 after an absence of more than a year \u2013 and is proposing the bridge\u2011building dinner. He has met Ben\u00edtez \u2013 who is refusing to extend a contract which runs out in the summer in the wake of the owner\u2019s transfer market parsimony \u2013 only three times and had also been engaged in a long-running dispute with the squad over bonuses. It appears that the contract issue is exerting a debilitating all-round effect. Matt Ritchie looked distinctly unimpressed and asked his manager \u201cWhat for?\u201d as he walked off following the decision to replace him with fellow winger Jacob Murphy during the Leicester game. Newcastle fans seemed equally puzzled and took the step, hitherto unconsidered, of booing Ben\u00edtez\u2019s decision."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
