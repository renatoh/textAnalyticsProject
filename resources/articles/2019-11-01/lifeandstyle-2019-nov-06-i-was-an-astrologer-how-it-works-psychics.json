And then a figure, at the edge of his vision. Now something grabbed his fingers or stroked his arm. There was more \u2013 and it was happening more frequently. \u201cI saw a Catholic priest,\u201d said the man. \u201cBut he couldn\u2019t help. Can you?\u201d Yes, yes I could. I knew exactly what he needed to do. I was a fortune teller. Every Sunday, I climbed the stairs of an old terrace house in Sydney\u2019s historic Rocks district, to sit in the attic and divine the future. I would read Tarot cards or interpret horoscopes. As a teenager, I\u2019d devoured a book called Positive Magic. An instruction manual for witches, its central idea was that if you wanted something, and you had good intentions, you just told the universe and magic would happen. Although nothing I wanted (fame, money, hot boyfriend) actually arrived, one thing led to another and I taught myself to read Tarot cards. At the time I was a science student, and just considered it a fun game at parties. That changed after I took my cards to my part-time job and read them for a colleague during the break. She picked the card for pregnancy, which we laughed about, because she wanted her tubes tied. A week later she said, \u201cGuess what the doctor told me this morning?\u201d She was pregnant, and I was officially psychic. Deciding to develop my gift, I enrolled in a psychic class, where I learned to say the first thing that popped into my head. \u201cYour first thoughts are the most psychic ones, before your rational mind interferes,\u201d said the teacher. I also learned that all things are connected, and everything is a symbol of something else. Suddenly, I saw signs and omens everywhere. To test my new skills, I volunteered to be a clairvoyant at the spiritualist church. Congregants would place a flower on the table, and the clairvoyants would choose one and \u201cread\u201d it at the microphone. Nervous, the first thing I grabbed was a packet of silver foil. The rose inside had been packed so tightly, its petals were crushed. I didn\u2019t get a single vibe from it, so I just described the symbolism. \u201cYou are feeling battered and bruised,\u201d I said. Afterwards, a woman approached and said she was a victim of domestic violence, and what should she do? I was only 19 and had no idea, but my psychic reputation soared. The attention was intoxicating. Then the universe told me I wasn\u2019t cut out for science, by sending me my second-year results. I dropped out to pursue theatre and also signed up for a one-year course at the Sydney Astrology Centre, a cavernous commercial building in a seedy part of town. The course began with the meanings of the zodiac, from Aries to Aquarius. Then the luminaries; the sun (what you will become), the moon (what you brought into this life) and planets. After that, how to calculate planetary positions and cast horoscopes. Although astrologers use Nasa data for their calculations, horoscopes aren\u2019t a true map of the heavens. The Babylonians who invented astrology believed the sun rotated round the Earth; modern astrologers still use Earth-centred charts, as if Copernicus had never existed. That\u2019s only the start of the scientific problems. The astrological meanings themselves derive from a principle called sympathetic magic, where things that look alike are linked together. Mars looks red, so it rules red things like blood. How do you get blood? You cut, so Mars rules surgery and war. You forecast by combining meanings with planetary movements. Say Saturn, planet of restrictions, is about to transit the First House of self \u2013 your life will contract! You\u2019re going to get more responsibilities than usual. Or maybe you\u2019ll be denied the chance to take on more responsibilities. Or maybe a cold, critical person will come into your life. But anyway, it\u2019s a good time to go on a diet. Astrology is one big word association game. I loved it, though I was losing interest in other mystical practices. Partly I didn\u2019t have time, because I was now immersed in theatre while working as a temp typist at St Vincent\u2019s, a Catholic hospital. But as I bounced from one department to another, my views changed. I\u2019d understood organised religion to be something between an embarrassment and an evil. Yet as Aids did its dreadful work \u2013 this was the 1990s \u2013 I watched nuns offer compassionate care to the dying. Christian volunteers checked on derelict men with vomit down their clothes. I became uncomfortably aware that New Agers do not build hospitals or feed alcoholics \u2013 they buy self-actualisation at the cash register. Finally, I was accepted into a music degree and my days filled with classes, my nights with rehearsals. This caused a cash crisis, because I could only do office work during academic holidays. When I saw the ad for a fortune teller, I pounced. My credentials impressed the man on the counter (\u201cMy name is Ron,\u201d he said. \u201cMy spirit guide is Blue Star. He\u2019s on the intergalactic committee\u201d) and I was hired. We charged A$50 an hour, a significant sum at the time, and I wanted to offer value. No fishing for clues from me \u2013 I printed a horoscope or laid the cards and started interpreting immediately, intending to dazzle the customer with my insights. Half the time, though, I couldn\u2019t get a word in. It turned out what most people want is the chance to unload for an hour. The range of problems faced by people who can afford $50 for fortune telling turned out to be limited: troubles with romance, troubles at work, trouble mustering the courage for a much-needed change. I heard these stories so often I could often guess what the problem was the moment someone walked in. Heartbroken young men, for example, talk about it to psychics, because it\u2019s less risky than telling their friends. Sometimes I\u2019d mischievously say, \u201cLet her go. She\u2019s not worth it,\u201d as soon as one arrived. Once I heard, \u201cOh my God, oh my GOD!\u201d as an amazed guy fell backwards down the stairs. I also learned that intelligence and education do not protect against superstition. Many customers were stockbrokers, advertising executives or politicians, dealing with issues whose outcomes couldn\u2019t be controlled. It\u2019s uncertainty that drives people into woo, not stupidity, so I\u2019m not surprised millennials are into astrology. They grew up with Harry Potter and graduated into a precarious economy, making them the ideal customers. What broke the spell for me was, oddly, people swearing by my gift. Some repeat customers claimed I\u2019d made very specific predictions, of a kind I never made. It dawned on me that my readings were a co-creation \u2013 I would weave a story and, later, the customer\u2019s memory would add new elements. I got to test this theory after a friend raved about a reading she\u2019d had, full of astonishingly accurate predictions. She had a tape of the session, so I asked her to play it. The clairvoyant had said none of the things my friend claimed. Not a single one. My friend\u2019s imagination had done all the work. Yet sometimes I could be uncannily accurate \u2013 wasn\u2019t that proof I was psychic? One Sunday, I went straight from work to a party, before I\u2019d had time to shuck off my psychic persona. A student there mentioned she wasn\u2019t sure what to specialize in \u2013 photography, graphic design or maybe industrial design? \u201cDo photography,\u201d I said. She looked at me, wide-eyed. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d she said, explaining photography was her real love, but her parents didn\u2019t approve. I couldn\u2019t say, \u201cbecause my third eye is open\u201d, so I reflected for a moment. Then it hit me. \u201cYou sounded happier when you said \u2018photography\u2019,\u201d I said. My psychic teacher was right \u2013 the signals we pick up before conscious awareness kicks in can be accurate and valuable. Well, maybe I wasn\u2019t psychic, but it didn\u2019t matter. It was just entertainment, after all, until the cursed man came in. The one who\u2019d seen the Catholic priest. \u201cGet to a doctor,\u201d I told him. \u201cNow.\u201d That very week, I\u2019d typed letters for a neurologist who specialized in brain diseases. Some of those letters had documented strikingly similar symptoms to this man. \u201cAre you saying I\u2019m crazy?\u201d he said, his hands balled. \u201cNo,\u201d I reassured him. \u201cBut Catholic priests know what they\u2019re doing. If he couldn\u2019t help, this isn\u2019t a curse.\u201d That made the man angrier. \u201cYou\u2019re a fraud!\u201d he shouted, and stormed downstairs to demand his money back. The encounter shook me, badly. Shortly afterwards, I packed my astrology books and Tarot cards away for good. I can still make the odd forecast, though. Here\u2019s one: the venture capital pouring into astrology apps will create a fortune telling system that works, because humans are predictable. As people follow the advice, the apps\u2019 predictive powers will increase, creating an ever-tighter electronic leash. But they\u2019ll be hugely popular \u2013 because if you sprinkle magic on top, you can sell people anything."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
