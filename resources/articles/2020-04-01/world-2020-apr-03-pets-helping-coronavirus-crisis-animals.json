The timing is a godsend.\u201d The puppy has helped her children, aged 12 and 15, adjust to life at home in Sevenoaks, Kent, without school, sport or much of a social life. \u201cThey entertain each other,\u201d says Brown. \u201cMy daughter would have been bored witless without him. He\u2019s brought structure to the day, and is getting us all outside in the garden.\u201d The benefits of pet ownership for health and wellbeing are well-documented, reducing loneliness and anxiety, lending daily structure, and lifting mood. And that\u2019s in normal circumstances. In lockdown, pets are proving a lifesaver for many, providing companionship, consistency and even joy. \u201cBarney is definitely reducing the stress levels and upping the fun in our house,\u201d says Brown. Dogs in particular have helped to keep their owners active, demanding daily walks, pandemic or no. Bethan Taylor-Swaine, who lives in Brixton, south-west London, has been lending her brussels griffon dog, Loki, to her neighbours \u2013 for their benefit, and his. \u201cHe\u2019s super social, and he just can\u2019t fathom how he\u2019s gone from essentially being treated like a boy band member to only really seeing me and my husband.\u201d Afsaneh Parvizi-Wayne, from Highgate in north London, says Honey, a two-year-old cockapoo, has helped keep her husband sane as he weathers the coronavirus crisis as a hospital consultant. \u201cHe walks through the door and she\u2019s waiting for him, and he\u2019s on the floor playing with her. You can visibly see the day\u2019s stress and anxieties diminishing,\u201d Parvizi-Wayne says. Rachel Conlisk, who lives in Birmingham, says her cats, Belle and Little Tyke, have been a great comfort to her and her 11-year-old son, Sam. \u201cThey\u2019ve been happy having us home \u2013 they\u2019re always on our laps,\u201d says Conlisk. \u201cWe\u2019ve found that when everything\u2019s so crazy out there, it\u2019s been really nice having them around \u2013 they remind you that life goes on.\u201d Sam says when he has felt worried or sad, cuddling Little Tyke has made him feel better. \u201cShe\u2019s a tabby cat. She\u2019s got a small head and a big body. She sleeps on my bed.\u201d Conlisk says Little Tyke is \u201creally tolerant\u201d. But it is not only dogs and cats that bring benefits. Alexander Phasey, 18, from Newport in south Wales, says his reptiles have been key to managing his severe social anxiety and depression. He has about 18 animals, including bearded dragons, leopard geckos, corn snakes, tortoises, and monitor lizards, the largest of which is about three-quarters-of-a-metre (2.5ft) long and growing. His \u201cbaby\u201d is Lily, a nine-month-old Argentinian black-and-white tegu \u2013 a large tropical lizard. \u201cI\u2019ve got a proper bond with her. I\u2019ll tap my hand to the floor and she\u2019ll come running out like a puppy, tasting everything with her tongue.\u201d Coronavirus has had minimal impact on his ability to care for them, says Phasey, though his pet food supplier is struggling to meet demand from reptile owners stockpiling for their pets: \u201cThere\u2019s a shortage of locusts.\u201d Some people without pets have seen lockdown as an opportunity to bring one home. Many animal charities have reported an increase in fostering and adoptions, despite most centres being closed to the public. Battersea Dogs and Cats Home rehomed 86 dogs and 69 cats in one week in mid-March, more than double the animals placed during the same period last year. One dog, Tulip, had been at the centre for 110 days. Dogs Trust has reported a 25% increase in adoptions, but warned that \u201ca dog is for life \u2026 not just for lockdown\u201d. \u201cWe really need people to think about what might happen on the other side of this outbreak when people are hopefully back to their usual routines and have other commitments,\u201d said the trust\u2019s operations director, Adam Clowes. Some animals appear to be struggling with the disruption to their routines. Livi Perkins, a pet sitter in Rock Ferry, Wirral, has been put out of work by the pandemic and says a client sent her footage of their dog reacting to a video Perkins posted on Instagram. \u201cShe heard my voice and ran around looking for me.\u201d Caroline Wilkinson, an animal behaviorist and dog trainer near Bristol, says dogs in particular can become needy or prone to barking with their humans more available. She recommends keeping their mealtimes and bedtimes consistent, and ensuring they have some time by themselves. Dogs may even need \u201ca rest day\u201d from all the exercise. For now, many pets are relishing their owners\u2019 extra attention and new enthusiasm for walks. Brown \u2013 who has always worked from home, as a website designer \u2013 worries for Barney, who will have never known any other life. \u201cWhen this is all over, and everybody goes back to work and school, I\u2019m going to have a dog that is suddenly wondering where everybody has gone.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
