Fifty-four children returned to Australia from Nauru were part of the 267 asylum seekers and refugees who were the focus of a nationwide Let Them Stay campaign. In answer to a February question on notice specifically about that 267 cohort, a Department of Immigration and Border Protection official has told the Senate: \u201cas at 8 February 2016, there were 25 minors from Nauru who were in Australia with a clinically diagnosed mental health condition including depression and anxiety\u201d. \u201cAdditionally, there were five minors in Australia for other long-term medical issues.\u201d In February, 267 asylum seekers and refugees became the focus of intense public campaigning over a high court challenge to their detention and government plans to return them to Nauru and Manus Island. The 267 had been brought to Australia from the detention centres on Nauru and Manus Island because of a serious medical condition, or because a close family member required medical attention. Thirty-seven were babies who had been born in Australia, and had never been to Nauru, but were deemed \u201cillegal maritime arrivals\u201d because of their parents\u2019 migration status. Fifty-four were children who had been detained in the Nauru detention centre. Guardian Australia understands there may be a small number of additional children returned to Australia from Nauru who are not part of the 267. The government\u2019s own reporting has found detention is especially harmful for children. The chief medical officer and surgeon general of the Australian Border Force, Dr John Brayley, told a Senate estimates hearing in February: \u201cthe scientific evidence is that detention affects the mental state of children, it\u2019s deleterious.\u201d \u201cWherever possible, children should not be in detention.\u201d Confidential reports to government by detention health provider IHMS \u2013 obtained under Freedom of Information by the Guardian \u2013 consistently show children in detention suffer more acute mental health crises than adults, and their mental health deteriorates the longer they are detained. IHMS has also told the government mental health damage to children persists long after they are released. Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, who asked about the children\u2019s mental health at the Senate estimates hearing, said the children and their families should be allowed to apply for permanent visas to stay in Australia \u201cso that they can live in safety and rebuild their shattered lives\u201d. \u201cThreatening to send these children to Nauru is keeping them in a state of constant fear and anxiety,\u201d Hanson-Young said. \u201cNo child should be subjected to this sort of mental torture.\u201d The 267 asylum seekers were enjoined to a high court challenge brought by a Bangladeshi women \u2013 M68 \u2013 who challenged the constitutionality of her detention offshore. The M68 challenge failed in the high court, a majority of the full bench ruling the government does have the power to detain people offshore. But as public protests grew across the country under the banner of Let Them Stay, and more than 100 churches said they would defy the government to offer sanctuary to those facing removal, the 267 were allowed to stay in Australia. None have yet been returned to Nauru or Manus. More than half, including all of the children, have been released from immigration detention into the Australian community. The government maintains there has been no alteration to the policy of offshore processing that, it says, demonstrably saves lives at sea. Immigration minister Peter Dutton said the 267 are liable to be returned to Nauru or Manus because there is \u201cno lawful basis\u201d for them to stay in Australia. He said children would not be sent \u201cback into harm\u2019s way,\u201d but that the government would maintain \u201cthe principle we\u2019ve adhered to in the past\u201d, that people needing serious medical treatment would be brought to Australia as required, but would never be resettled in Australia. \u201cWhen there\u2019s no longer a case for them to remain in Australia, they will be returned.\u201d Shen Narayanasamy, human rights director of GetUp!, the organisation which led the Let Them Stay campaign, said medical opinion had conclusively shown detention camps caused mental and physical harm to those detained. \u201cIt is shocking, but unsurprising, that so many of the 267 children are suffering, and [this] should prompt the government to let them stay in Australia.\u201d She said the children in the 267 cohort still suffered because of the uncertainty around their futures. \u201cWith the government still stating that they will be deported, they can\u2019t even plan to be here for a football final. This uncertainty is extremely damaging for anyone, let alone a child.\u201d Daniel Webb from the Human Rights Law Centre said it was inexcusable that successive governments had knowingly caused harm to children by detaining them. \u201cSome of these children actually took their first steps and spoke their first words in detention and until recently had never known a day of freedom in their lives. Finally releasing them was an important first step towards compassion and decency. \u201cThe next step is to allow them to apply for protection in Australia. They need to be able to begin rebuilding their lives without the threat of sudden deportation hanging over their heads.\u201d Webb said adults were harmed by detention too. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t suddenly stop damaging people on their 18th birthday\u201d. The government announced earlier this month it had released all children from detention, moving families into community detention. For some children, this was done by reclassifying the family compound of Villawood detention centre as \u201ccommunity detention\u201d and relaxing monitoring. Some children, who were not boat arrivals and were facing removal from the country, were still detained beyond the government\u2019s declaration. And Australia\u2019s policy of mandatory detention of all boat arrivals, including children \u2013 in effect since 1992 \u2013 remains unchanged. Fifty children remain on Nauru. Both the Australian and Nauru governments maintain those children are not detained because the camp is now an \u201copen centre\u201d. This is contested by refugee advocates, human rights groups and lawyers. Also revealed by Senate estimates questioning: the cost of detaining a single person on Christmas Island for a single day is $1,458. (There are currently 167 men held on Christmas Island) the Australian Border Force spent $400,000 on branded \u201cdecals\u201d for its helicopters, cars, vessels, and planes the Australian Border Force spent $20,000 on ABF-branded flags for buildings and boats 65% of school-aged children in the Nauru detention centre attended school at least once in the first fortnight of school term this year (32 out of 49 school-aged children)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
