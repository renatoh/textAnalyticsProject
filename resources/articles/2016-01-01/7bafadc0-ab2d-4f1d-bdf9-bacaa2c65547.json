Wideman will attend a personal hearing with the NHL on Tuesday. He was not penalised for the hit on linesman Don Henderson, which Wideman said was unintentional. The 32-year-old former All-Star could be banned for 20 games if Colin Campbell, the NHL\u2019s senior executive vice president of hockey operations, determines that he attacked Henderson deliberately. Wideman had been levelled by Nashville winger Miikka Salomaki and was skating toward the Flames\u2019 bench when he shoved Henderson from behind, sending Henderson to the ice and against the boards. The Flames defenseman said after the game that he was distracted after the Salomaki hit and unintentionally collided with Henderson. \u201cI took a pretty good hit down in the corner and had some pretty good pain in my shoulder and neck,\u201d Wideman said. \u201cI was just trying to get off the ice and kind of keeled over. At the last second, I looked up and saw [Henderson] and couldn\u2019t avoid it. I went up to Donnie and apologized to him on the ice. \u201cI didn\u2019t see him. I didn\u2019t know where to go and how to get out of the way. I\u2019ve been around for a few years, and I think I\u2019ve treated every official with the utmost respect, and I would never intentionally try to hit a linesman or a ref. It was completely unintentional, and I already apologized to him.\u201d At the next stoppage, Wideman skated over to where the officials were gathered and apologized. Flames coach Bob Hartley said: \u201cWe all know Wides; a great guy. He\u2019s not an aggressive person of any nature, and it was just like a bad accident.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
