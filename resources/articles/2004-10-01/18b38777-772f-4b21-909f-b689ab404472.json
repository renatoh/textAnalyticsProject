I know a great many teachers who, frankly, are 'not fit for purpose'. There are, equally, many outstanding teachers in the profession. But to denigrate the 'classroom assistant' shows a manifest ignorance of the teamwork required in modern teaching. Many of these so-called 'classroom assistants' are highly motivated and capable. Their contributions should not be underrated nor devalued. They can hardly be doing it for the money. Nick Martin Cambridge Animal instincts I resent Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall's accusation (Observer Food Monthly, last week) that animal rights supporters are only interested in the welfare of foxes. I take a higher moral stance on the issue of intensively-farmed animals than Mr Fearnley-Whittingstall: I haven't eaten a pig or any other breed of animal for almost 15 years. This is the most effective way to ensure one is not contributing to the cruelty inherent in killing animals. I, too, would like to see 50-plus million Britons hunting and killing the animals that they consume, but this is an option available only to the select few. Ryan Harkin Surbiton, Surrey Research crisis That 40 per cent of scientific researchers in the US were born in Europe, as Robin McKie states (Comment, last week), shows the dominance of American science and technology is not confined to this country. Perhaps it also provides a way out of the problem. No European country can match America's resources. Yet scientific cooperation within Europe has been very successful in such fields as space and nuclear research, which, however, require public funding. There has been less success in areas requiring the transformation of laboratory knowledge for the production line, which requires substantial investment in capital and marketing. Few European companies have the scale of finance and facilities, or the confidence in their market, to exploit the potential of their discoveries and inventions. Unless the problem McKie raises is tackled more vigorously and more objectively at the European level, that will be the fate of many more British and other European companies. Roger Broad London W2 Pension scandal In your leader last week you report Alan Johnson, Work and Pensions Secretary, as saying 'we should all be saving more for our retirement'. At the Labour Party Conference, Gordon Brown promised 'social justice for all'. With the demise of final salary pension schemes in the private sector, workers in this sector are all too aware of their pension shortfall and would dearly like to save more for their retirement. Unfortunately, they cannot do so because they are forced, through taxation, to fund public sector final salary pensions so that public sector workers don't have to bother saving for their own retirement. Isn't it time for all public sector final salary schemes to fall in line with the private sector and be closed? George Collier Tickhill, Doncaster No cop-out The statement that 'anyone can become a therapist - they do not have to undergo training' is misleading (News, last week). It is true - and not satisfactory - that the titles of 'psychotherapist' and 'counsellor' are not legally protected and the professions are not statutorily regulated. We hope this will be rectified. However, it is really difficult for someone to establish a practice in psychotherapy or counselling without adhering to the stringent training requirements of one or the other of the UK Council for Psychotherapy, British Confederation of Psychotherapists, British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, British Psychological Society, or the Independent Practitioners Network. Those contemplating therapy or in therapy, should ask the therapist about their qualifications and training. We welcome the creative initiative of the BACP in commissioning the report that shows how 'normal' therapy is becoming. But people often do not realise how much courage it takes to talk to a therapist. It is not the cop-out that critics like Frank Furedi suggest. Therapy often leads to clients taking more active roles in their relationships. Professor Andrew Samuels UK Council for Psychotherapy London N7 Patient power I am a GP who is actively involved in providing out-of-hours care with Sheffield GP Collaborative, and whose practice isn't exercising its right to opt out (News, last week). The fact that patients were well enough to attend A&amp;E departments means that, unless they arrived by ambulance, by definition their condition did not require a home visit. Andy Godden Firth Park Surgery, Sheffield Getting the Blues Will Hutton (Comment, last week) is right to draw attention to private education as a source of social engineering, but is wrong to beat Oxford with this particular stick. He says Oxbridge applicants' futures are determined by 'how they present themselves at interview'. Selection, admittedly a far-from-perfect science, is based on all the information we have available. It is incorrect that selection is based only or even primarily on the interview. And why should preference be given to a 'state' grammar school pupil, who had enjoyed benefits of selective education that are not widely available, based on where one lives in the country, and sometimes where one's parents can afford to live? Professor Miles Hewstone New College, Oxford True colour Emma Lindsey (Culture, last week) reports an irritation at the V&amp;A exhibition of 'Black British Style', and the impression she was 'in the midst of a quasi-anthropological excursion. She may like to know the questions her review describes the exhibition as exploring are the ones anthropologists also ask.
