The scoreline may be pretty boring and repetitive but it is proving highly effective for West Brom. This was their 16th 1-0 victory of the season. They have also kept a club record of 25 clean sheets in the current campaign and those are statistics that have taken them level on points with second-placed Wolves, their big West Midlands rivals. And, after Bob Taylor's first-half strike ensured their latest success at Highfield Road the pendulum for automatic promotion appears to be swinging the short distance from Molineux to the Hawthorns. A confident West Brom have won their last five games and have a more favourable looking run-in than Wolves The performance here yesterday typified the work ethic of their manager Gary Megson. They never stopped running at a busy stage of the season when many players are appearing heavy-legged. Their goal came early, the veteran striker Taylor, making only his first start in 24 matches, poking home in the 16th minute following a goal mouth scramble. Neither side posed too much of a threat following that as defences dominated. For Albion Darren Moore was arock at the back, although Coventry were pretty toothless in their forward advances despite the endeavour of their central midfield pair of Colin Healy and John Eustace. The visitors played the final minutes with only 10 men, Trevor Benjamin being sent off for a late, high lunge on Mo Konjic, but that was still not enough to dampen Megson's spirits. \"That was a great result for us and the result was what it was all about today,\" said the Albion manager. \"We've got to keep plugging away now in the same vein as we have been and hope that it proves good enough to give us automatic promotion.\" As for Coventry, whose former Albion striker Lee Hughes endured a fruitless and ineffective outing, their manager Roland Nilsson admitted: \"Our play-off chances are getting slimmer. We have three matches left and we need to win them all. Draws are just not good enough now.\" \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
