You could say the stakes are high in the super-casino that is Westminster. Charles Clarke is right to call for debate. But it's how that debate is conducted that matters. If the terms are set too widely, the public may reasonably conclude we don't have pride in what we have achieved, that we don't agree with or like each other, and that we're not sure where we want to go. That would be to make a big mistake. It wouldn't represent majority feeling among Labour MPs elected at the 1997, 2001 and 2005 elections. A divisive leadership contest now would bring into question what is a very real unity about our direction of travel. Worse, it would risk squandering possibly Labour's greatest strength and, for the party, Tony Blair's most valuable legacy: a younger generation of MPs, councillors and members with a shared outlook and political purpose. To force our generation to turn in on itself, to decide \"which side they're on\", just as Cameron's Tories are gathering pace, would be a strategic error. Growing up in the 1980s wasn't a lot of fun if you cared about politics. The decade of Dallas, Dynasty and royal weddings was indelibly marked for Thatcher's children in politics today by the miners' strike, picket lines, dole queues, leaking schools, desperate hospitals and the extraordinary epithet that \"there is no such thing as society\". Yet cast in the background, like shadow puppets, was the spectacle of the Labour party tearing itself apart. The experience of being able only to watch and not act on the political stage of the 80s was pretty sobering. But it inspired a generation who arrived in the 90s with a strong sense of common purpose. We think Gordon Brown's succession is the way to rejuvenate that common purpose today. Our strength in depth should terrify the Tories. Most of us were at school and university in the 80s and developed a lifelong loathing for them. We got into politics to bring a more equal sharing of health, wealth and life chances. But we arrived with an allergy to the division and indiscipline of the 80s. We put a premium on unity. Tony Blair has shown us that we can achieve those goals in government. But, in many of our constituencies, real regeneration is only now gathering pace. To put that social progress at risk would be deeply irresponsible and self-indulgent. A decade of reform in the public services has tested friendships and caused divisions. We have kept up the pace because we know that public confidence in those services depends on visible progress. But the \"why?\" of the reform programme has become less clear 10 years on. The time has come to articulate a new way of doing things. What was right for the last decade will not be right for the next. Top-down targets have helped transform the NHS, to the point where waiting and waiting lists as we have known them will have ended. But we should acknowledge that some change has been disempowering and alienating for staff. The next decade should be about a different approach, where staff are given the chance to lead change and decisions are not handed down but offered up. Over the past year the government has worked hard on the policy review now being published. The months ahead offer a unique chance to connect this long-term thinking constructively with the parliamentary Labour party and imaginatively with the public. Continuity and change is a hard act to master. We should avoid too many punch-ups about personalities. We should start making the next election a battle of ideas. \u00b7 Liam Byrne is a Home Office minister and Andy Burnham is a health minister byrnel@parliament.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
