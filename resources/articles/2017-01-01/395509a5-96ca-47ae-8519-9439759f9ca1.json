Its central theme will be Magnus Carlsen\u2019s attempt to win by a clear margin and so reinforce the 26-year-old world champion\u2019s ambitions to establish himself as the best player of all time ahead of the legends Bobby Fischer and Garry Kasparov. Carlsen has a good opportunity because three of his major rivals, the world No2, Fabiano Caruana, and the dangerous Hikaru Nakamura from the US as well as France\u2019s world No5, Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, have all preferred to play at Tradewise Gibraltar, which starts on 24 January and is cementing its reputation as the best organised and strongest open tournament. The Norwegian still faces two top-class challengers. Russia\u2019s Sergey Karjakin will be out for revenge for his match defeat by Carlsen in New York and will want to confirm his victory at the world blitz (see this week\u2019s puzzle). The world No4, America\u2019s Wesley So, won the 2016 Grand Tour along with last month\u2019s London Classic and was the most successful elite grandmaster of all in 2016. Friday\u2019s drawing of lots gave Carlsen the black pieces against So in Saturday\u2019s opening round and White against Karjakin in the 13th and final round on 29 January. Armenia\u2019s Levon Aronian and Russia\u2019s Ian Nepomniachtchi will be serious contenders, while Hungary\u2019s Richard Rapport, aged 20, and the 17-year-old Chinese champion Wei Yi are the rising stars. Wijk also features a Challengers tournament where 12 of the 14 players are GMs and where England has a serious contender. Gawain Jones, the 29-year-old UK No5, has been in fine form recently. Jones will aim to surpass his No3 seeding, finish first and so qualify for Wijk\u2019s top event in 2018. India\u2019s Deep Sengupta, who won the Hastings Masters last week, used an interesting strategy to defeat a weaker opponent looking for a draw. His queen\u2019s side castling as Black is very unusual in this type of quiet opening but it had the desired effect of inducing White to throw pieces at the castled king, which Sengupta repelled by active piece play and then forcing judicious exchanges. Gordon Scott should have tried 22 Nd2! since as the game went he resigned three pawns down without compensation.
