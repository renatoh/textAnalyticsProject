A gale is whipping in off the Irish Sea, battering billboards advertising forthcoming shows starring Alvin Stardust, the Grumbleweeds and Roy \"Chubby\" Brown. There is not a donkey in sight. Guest houses to the north of the promenade are mostly shut, the bowling alley and nightclubs lifeless and several bars boarded up. One of the few signs of activity is at Gifts Galore, a seafront store opposite the north pier where jesters' hats and beachballs hanging from an awning bob defiantly in the wind. Huddled inside is a small group of pensioners, browsing through the sticks of rock, postcards and rows of Britney Spears mugs while they wait to get on the coach back home. Two old ladies have strayed into the 'adults only' section and are sniggering uncontrollably at a extensive display of phallic novelty gags. Yet their laughter disguises a more serious reality. After decades of decline Britain's most popular holiday resort, synonymous with kiss-me-quick hats and hen parties, is in urgent need of resuscitation. Unique solution Blackpool still attracts 12m people each year but visitor numbers are 30% down on six years ago and, for a local economy that derives 85% of its income from tourism, that is a serious issue. It is a similar story at most other seaside towns, though some are attracting tourists who cannot visit the country during the foot and mouth crisis. Holidaymakers are shunning British resorts to take advantage of cheap packages and budget flights to go abroad for the sun, according to a recent study by the English Tourist Council. A unique solution has been proposed for Blackpool. A reclusive multimillionaire wants to turn the town into a Las Vegas for the north, making it a gambling mecca that would attract tourists from all over Europe and revitalise the local economy. Trevor Hemmings, a former builder who made his first fortune from Pontins holiday camps and is so low profile that some locals liken him to the Wizard of Oz, wants to build a series of Vegas-style casino, hotel and retail complexes on the seafront. He proposes to build the Pharaoh's Palace Resort, a \u00a3130m complex with an ancient Egyptian theme, 100,000 sq ft of gaming floors to be open 24 hours a day, 2,500 slot machines, 100,000 sq ft of conference and exhibition space, a 3,000 sq ft auditorium, a 500-bed hotel and extensive retail space. To some it is so extravagant as to be unrealistic but minister for tourism Janet Anderson was in town yesterday to hear the results of a new poll that claims 71% of locals are behind the concept and to underline that the government is taking it seriously. Locals say she has to. Allan Cavill, chief executive of the Blackpool Challenge Partnership, a forum representing local public and private sector interests, says GDP is the 12th lowest in the UK and the third lowest in the region. Unemployment in the town's four most central wards is 10% to 12%, the area is the third most deprived in the country and 6,000 homes have more than one family living in them. \"There are some pretty frightening social problems right behind the promenade,\" Mr Cavill said. \"We lost visitors throughout the 1980s and 1990s and it was probably only the slap in the face the Labour party delivered in 1998 when it said that it wouldn't hold its party conference here again until things improved that made people realise it wasn't OK.\" Leisure Parcs, the company that Mr Hemmings has formed in partnership with Bank of Scotland and venture capitalists Electra, believes resort casinos can be used as a tool of urban renewal in the same way as they have transformed Atlantic City and Biloxi in the US. Over there tax from gaming is ploughed back into the local community and into regeneration projects. Marc Etches, the managing director of Leisure Parcs, claims that the introduction of up to six resort casino hotels offering up to 6,000 rooms could potentially create 15,000 direct jobs, a further 10,000 ancillary jobs and gross revenues in excess of \u00a3500m. Leisure industry watchers believe predictions of 30m annual visitors spending \u00a32bn by 2020 are optimistic. Mr Etches disagrees. \"If we can get 10m visitors now when we have an off-season that runs from October to May then 30m has to be realistic if we have a year round resort,\" he said. \"Without this plan, Blackpool may be supping at the last chance saloon.\" Basil Newby, owner of gay nightclub chain In the Pink Leisure, warns the town's image will have to change. \"We've got a long way to go,\" he said. \"Las Vegas gets Shirley Bassey and Tom Jones. We get Cannon and Ball and Hale and Pace.\" Gaming review Leisure Parcs has already spent \u00a385m over the past three years buying up local landmarks including the Blackpool Tower, the resort's three piers, the Opera House Theatre, the Winter Gardens entertainment centre, Louis Tussauds Waxworks and the Savoy and Clifton Hotels. However, it still has some obstacles to overcome if its vision is to become a reality. The first requires a change to the 1968 Regulation of Gaming Act which was introduced to kick organised crime out of gambling. It restricts the way that casinos advertise, bans live entertainment, limits the number of jackpot slot machines and says casinos can only admit new members after a 24-hour \"cooling-off\" period. Government sources suggest an ongoing review of gaming will recommend the rules be relaxed when it reports to home secretary Jack Straw in June. Levying taxes locally may be more difficult, confirms a Treasury spokesman. Regional councils do not have the power to tax local businesses or ring fence where the proceeds are spent. Leisure Parcs will have to modify its proposals. It will also need other financial partners. The BCP is ready to commit \u00a320m of cash it won through a single regeneration budget bid, but London Clubs International, Mr Etches' commercial partner, has already had its fingers burnt by a casino venture in Las Vegas and its share price has collapsed. Despite the overwhelming support shown by yesterday's survey there is a growing sense of unease among local small businesses. Dennis Smith has been running the Abbey Hotel, a 10-bed hotel since moving from Featherstone in west Yorkshire 12 years ago. He is broadly in favour of casinos but fears shiny new four-star hotels offering subsidised rooms at two-star rates to encourage more gamblers could be disastrous for him and the 2,500 other small hotels in town. \"My business is down 70% over the past five years, the place next door has gone bankrupt twice since I've been here and, despite spending \u00a380,000 improving a property that I bought for \u00a3126,000, I've been told it is now only worth \u00a3115,000,\" Mr Smith said. \"This could be the straw that breaks me.\" His concerns are echoed by David Gee, the owner of Gifts Galore, who last year saw trade rise to record levels after he decided to target the stag and hen parties and stay open beyond midnight. \"Casinos could destroy this town and my business,\" said Mr Gee. \"The seafront will be nothing but pawn brokers and strip joints.\" Infrastructure will also need to be improved. Seven million people live within a one hour drive of Blackpool but car parking and rail links would not be able to cope with the volume of visitors. Even now it is often quicker and cheaper for Londoners to fly to southern France or Spain than brave the Virgin train service to Blackpool. Yet what worries locals most is that there is no alternative on the table if the Leisure Parcs plan falls at the first hurdle. \"How can highly trained people only come up with one option?\" Mr Smith said. \"There's a set of farts in the town hall who've been presented with this plan and think its manna from the gods. They think the town will be quids in but I tell you, ten years from now, thousands of us will be out of business.\" The bets have been placed and the stakes are high. Blackpool must wait until the gaming review body reports in June to find out if it has any chance of winning.
