In 2003, the UK drug regulator instructed doctors not to prescribe paroxetine \u2013 sold as Seroxat in the UK and Paxil in the US \u2013 to adolescents. But experts who have obtained the original data say the study is still referred to in the medical literature and needs to be retracted. In their re-analysis of the trial, published in the British Medical Journal, they say the beneficial effects of paroxetine on young people were far less and the harmful effects far greater than the study suggested. Out of 275 children and adolescents in the trial, 11 taking the drug and one in the group given a placebo developed suicidal or self-harming behaviour. The original publication of the study reported five on the drug and one on placebo. There were no reports of suicidality on a second drug, imipramine, which was also tested in study 329. David Healy, professor of psychiatry at Bangor University in Wales, said it was hard to see how so many suicidal children could have been overlooked. \u201cWe think if you were to go in and look at this data, anyone without training will find there are at least of the order of 12 children becoming suicidal on this drug out of about 93 [who were given it],\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a very high rate of kids going on to become suicidal. It doesn\u2019t take expertise to find this. It takes extraordinary expertise to avoid finding it.\u201d In an article published with the re-analysis, Peter Doshi, associate editor of the BMJ, said the new paper \u201chas reignited calls for retraction of the original study, putting additional pressure on academic and professional institutions to publicly address the many allegations of wrongdoing.\u201d He said few trials had been as controversial as study 329, whose lead author was Martin Keller from Brown University. In 2002, the year after its publication, the US Food and Drug Administration said it should be considered a failed trial because the depressed adolescents taking the drug did no better than those on placebo. In that same year, more than two million prescriptions for paroxetine were written for adolescents and children in the United States, on the back of an advertising campaign which claimed the trial had shown \u201cremarkable efficacy and safety\u201d. GSK was fined $3bn in 2012 for fraudulently promoting the drug. \u201cIt is often said that science self-corrects. But for those who have been calling for a retraction of the Keller paper for many years, the system has failed,\u201d Doshi writes. \u201cNone of the paper\u2019s 22 mostly academic university authors, nor the journal\u2019s editors, nor the academic and professional institutions they belong to, have intervened to correct the record. The paper remains without so much as an erratum, and none of its authors \u2013 many of whom are educators and prominent members of their respective professional societies \u2013 have been disciplined.\u201d The BMJ authors, led by Prof Jon Jureidini at the University of Adelaide, wrote to GSK in 2013 asking whether the company intended to re-analyse the data itself. They say GSK declined. However, GSK did co-operate with the re-analysis by agreeing to post 77,000 pages of de-identified case reports from the adolescents in the trial on a website. The BMJ paper is the first re-analysis of a drug study under a new initiative called Riat (Restoring Invisible and Abandoned Trials). Dr Fiona Godlee, BMJ editor-in-chief, said publication of the reanalysed data from study 329 \u201csets the record straight\u201d and \u201cshows the extent to which drug regulation is failing us\u201d. She said it also showed that the public and clinicians did not have the unbiased information they needed to make informed decisions. She called for independent clinical trials rather than trials funded and managed by industry, as well as legislation \u201cto ensure that the results of all clinical trials are made fully available and the individual patient data are available for legitimate independent third-party scrutiny.\u201d GSK stressed its commitment to transparency and its help for the researchers who re-analysed study 329. \u201cImportantly, the findings from this team\u2019s analysis appear to be in line with the longstanding view that there is an increased risk of suicidality in paediatric and adolescent patients given antidepressants like paroxetine,\u201d it said. \u201cThis is widely known and clear warnings have been in place on the product label for more than a decade. As such we don\u2019t believe this reanalysis affects patient safety.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
