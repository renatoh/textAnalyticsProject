Australia's former captain John Eales, who lifted the World Cup in 1999, started the ball rolling yesterday with an interview in The Australian newspaper, a piece that smacked of a deliberate ploy to get referees to focus on this key aspect of England's game. It was a tactic employed here two years ago, when the Lions toured and found themselves quickly embroiled in a media campaign against alleged illegalities, which included their scrummaging and mauling. The current Australia coach Eddie Jones, who was then in charge of the Super-12 side ACT Brumbies, played a pivotal role in the sniping. Woodward, the England head coach, was in Australia as a media commentator at the time and he launched a pre-emptive strike against the Wallabies last week, declaring that their second try against Argentina in the opening match should have been disallowed because a dummy runner physically took out a defender. Jones and the Wallabies smarted at that observation, so Eales's attack was no surprise. \"England's mauling amounts to obstruction because Neil Back is being shepherded at the back of it without always being attached,\" said the former second row. \"It is the forward equivalent of a decoy play in the back line. \"The referee should give a penalty if he feels that Back is not bound to the maul. As long as he is bound there is no problem, but that is not always the case.\" Jones, whose verbal spats with Woodward have become the stuff of legend, eagerly entered the fray. \"There is validity in what Eales is saying,\" he said. \"If you have a situation where there is no contest for possession it has to be looked at very carefully by referees. \"If the maul is refereed to the letter of the law then what England are doing is illegal because the players with the ball must be connected to the defending team. This has nothing to do with any supposed war of words with Clive Woodward. The critique is not coming from our side. I am just giving a commentary.\" The South Africa match is being refereed by an Australian, Peter Marshall, and the Springboks coach Rudi Straeuli will meet him today, when England's mauling will be the chief topic of discussion. \"I read what John Eales said. He's astute, he knows his rugby and at times England's mauling amounts to obstruction,\" said Straeuli, who had made no comment after Uruguay used the tactic against his side last week. \"It is one of the matters I will be raising with the referee. \"I will be clearing a lot of issues with the referee on Friday. The maul is one of England's powerful weapons: if Neil Back is bound, the maul is legal; if he is not - and this is something he does with Leicester as well as England - he is breaking the regulations and should be blown up.\" Jacques Brunel, France's forwards coach, agreed and then took the opportunity to condemn England's tactics in the lineout on the opposition throw. \"They only pretend to contest the ball,\" he said. \"They put their arms around the opponent's jumper while he is coming down to stop him from releasing the ball. At the same time another of their players goes through and round the lineout with his arms in the air to say, 'sorry ref, mistake', but he is actually slowing down their opposition's support players and should be blown up.\" New Zealand may be the favourites to win the Webb Ellis trophy, but England are the team most feared because of the prowess of their forwards. In the past 11 months the team have put 50 points past South Africa and defeated both Australia and New Zealand, home and away. When they beat the Wallabies in Melbourne last June one of their tries followed a 40-yard rolling maul. While Back scoffed at the accusations, saying they were born out of fear, the England forwards coach Andy Robinson said that every precaution has been taken to ensure that the mauling is within the rules. \"We look at making sure that we get the drive set up and then it is all about sustaining that drive,\" he said. \"We are picked out now and again for bumping into players but we have never given penalties away for our mauling. It has never been an issue.\" New Zealand were the only major nation to stay out of the row."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
