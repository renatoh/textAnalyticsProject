The Bath player has had a firm grip on the No13 jersey since the head coach, Eddie Jones, took charge but the 24-year-old Daly is now earmarked to partner Owen Farrell in midfield. Speedy and elusive, Daly, who has won five previous caps from the bench, can also kick long-range goals if required. He was a good enough cricketer to have represented England Under-15s but has had to wait patiently for a Twickenham starting chance despite his outstanding form for Wasps over the past year. Joseph has been nursing a slight groin strain which may have played some part in Jones\u2019s thinking. It increases to six the number of changes to the starting lineup from England\u2019s last outing against Australia in Sydney in June. Maro Itoje, George Kruis, James Haskell, Anthony Watson and Jack Nowell have already been sidelined through injury, offering opportunities to Courtney Lawes, Joe Launchbury, Tom Wood, Marland Yarde and Jonny May. There will also be potential Test debuts from the bench for the Harlequins prop Kyle Sinckler, the Wasps back-rower Nathan Hughes and Worcester\u2019s Ben Te\u2019o, with Sale\u2019s Josh Beaumont also in the frame should Jones decide on a 6-2 split between replacement forwards and backs when he confirms his plans on Thursday. Whoever plays it is clear England intend to hit South Africa where it hurts, with Lawes keen to make a lasting impact on his return to the starting XV. The hard-tackling forward is due to win his 50th cap and will be part of a home pack determined to counter the Springboks\u2019 trademark physicality. Lawes has started just one game at Twickenham since Jones took charge but is set to be reunited in the second row with Launchbury. With Wood back in the back-row mix and the Vunipola brothers currently in irresistible form there is a quiet belief within the England set-up that a first win over the Boks in 10 years is finally within reach. Lawes, however, has reiterated the need for the home side to smash everything in their path to make it happen. \u201cWe have spoken about how physical they are and how their mindset changes when they come to England and we will have to deal with that,\u201d said the 27-year-old, who won his first cap in 2009. \u201cWe have strategies around the pack to deal with their physicality and hopefully we will put that into effect.\u201d In his younger days Lawes was renowned for his shuddering big hits and, while employed more judiciously these days, it remains a strength. \u201cI am not too fussed about who I hit, where I hit or how hard it is as long as I am doing my job,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not go around like I was when I was 20 throwing my body into everyone. It\u2019s a lot more technique now and picking and choosing my shots. You can\u2019t fly into everyone as it doesn\u2019t work that well. The laws of the game are changing and I don\u2019t want to put my team in any stress from getting cards. The hits have taken a plunge from that.\u201d Top of his personal hit list is likely to be South Africa\u2019s Eben Etzebeth, a key man in the lineout for the Boks. \u201cHe\u2019s a big guy and he runs hard and straight,\u201d said Lawes. \u201cI\u2019m not going to fly into him and try and smoke him but I can certainly put him down and make the next guy\u2019s job a bit easier on my team.\u201d England XV v South Africa (probable ) Mike Brown (Harlequins); Marland Yarde (Harlequins), Elliot Daly (Wasps), Owen Farrell (Saracens), Jonny May (Gloucester); George Ford (Bath), Ben Youngs (Leicester); Mako Vunipola (Saracens), Dylan Hartley (Northampton, capt), Dan Cole (Leicester), Joe Launchbury (Wasps), Courtney Lawes (Northampton), Chris Robshaw (Harlequins), Tom Wood (Northampton), Billy Vunipola (Saracens)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
