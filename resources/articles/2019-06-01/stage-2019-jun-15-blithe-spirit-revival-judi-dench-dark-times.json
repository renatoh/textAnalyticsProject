But it turned out to be a big hit, with a record run in the West End and then Broadway before being turned into a film four years later starring Rex Harrison. Now the director of a new version of the film and one of its lead actors, Dame Judi Dench, feel that the \u201cdark space\u201d we are currently in provides another fittingly gloomy backdrop for the release of a production that they hope will lift people\u2019s spirits. The Oscar-winning actress plays the eccentric mystic, Madame Arcati, who inadvertently conjures up the ghost of a jealous first wife, who is unaware that she is dead when she returns to haunt her scoundrel husband and his new partner. \u201cWhen the play opened in the West End in 1941, its subject-matter was, on some levels, quite dark because it was about ghosts, death and losing people,\u201d said Edward Hall, the director of the latest incarnation of Blithe Spirit, which begins filming this week. \u201cBut actually Coward wrote this wonderful comedy and it struck a vein. I feel that the time is right to tell that story again to a broad audience because we\u2019re in quite a dark space at the moment.\u201d Dench is one of Britain\u2019s foremost actresses, whose roles have ranged from monarchs to M in the Bond films. Hall said: \u201cShe loves the story, the character and Coward. Like us, she feels it is a great moment to cheer people up. I said to her, \u2018when you come out of the cinema, you should feel like you\u2019ve drunk a glass of cold champagne a little too quickly\u2019.\u201d The film marks Hall\u2019s directorial debut in films. He has just stepped down as artistic director of the Hampstead theatre, London, where stage hits include Sunny Afternoon, the Kinks musical that was also a huge West End success, winning Olivier awards. His television productions have included William Boyd\u2019s Restless. Working with Dench is \u201cextra special\u201d, he said. His late father, the director Sir Peter Hall, cast Dench in landmark productions such as Antony and Cleopatra and A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, as well as another Coward classic, Hay Fever. Blithe Spirit, set in 1937, is one of Coward\u2019s most-loved plays. Hollywood studios competed to adapt it but Coward took the project instead to his friend David Lean. The new film will be released next year, marking the 75th anniversary of the original, which starred Margaret Rutherford alongside Rex Harrison. The shoot will take place at various UK locations, including a private art deco house and Cliveden, the National Trust\u2019s Buckinghamshire estate. Dench\u2019s character, Madame Arcati, is described by Coward as \u201ca striking woman, dressed not too extravagantly but with a decided bias towards the barbaric\u201d. Hall said: \u201cI always felt there was only one person in the world who could ever play her and that was Judi. Fortunately, she felt the same.\u201d Downton Abbey star Dan Stevens, who appeared with Dench in Hay Fever, is cast as bestselling crime novelist Charles who suffers from terrible writer\u2019s block in struggling with his first screenplay. His picture-perfect new wife Ruth dreams of leaving London for Hollywood. Seeking inspiration, he invites Madame Arcati to perform a s\u00e9ance in his home, only to realise that she has inadvertently summoned the spirit of his deceased first wife \u2013 the fiery Elvira, who tries to win back his affections, leading to an increasingly complex love triangle. The writer-producers, Nick Moorcroft and Meg Leonard, have adapted Blithe Spirit with Piers Ashworth. Moorcroft said: \u201cIt is one of Coward\u2019s most famous comedies and, right now, everybody needs a reason to laugh.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
