Settling himself in for a marathon session at the Festival Hall, which was packed to capacity with Indian families, Singh perched on a chair as he introduced the six musicians sitting cross-legged on a raised platform around him. They were an unusual line-up, playing a mixture of Indian and western acoustic instruments, and matching tablas and a rare Indian xylophone against violin and a couple of acoustic guitars. Singh introduced the musicians by describing their skills, family backgrounds, and even their academic qualifications, while the band members took turns to tune up and then warm up with a short solo. It was a good half hour before Singh began his performance, and four hours before he finally left the stage. Even then, he sounded as if he was just getting started. Considering his reputation as the world's finest singer of Ghazals, the highly emotional song-poems of India, Singh was a remarkably jovial, laid-back performer. He constantly broke off to talk about his early life or tell jokes, switching in and out of English. Now 60, he looked more like a maths professor than an entertainer, with his neat dark hair and glasses, but once he started singing he displayed a gently mesmeric, easy-going voice that never once sounded under pressure. Most of the songs were straightforward and melodic (Singh insists that \"whatever I sing is simple. I don't complicate things\") and ranged from cool, relaxed ballads dressed up with just a little vocal embroidery through to sturdier, rhythmic pieces, again treated with the same laid-back charm. At times it was like listening to the Asian answer to a super-relaxed country singer, helped out by an impressive band who could dress up a sad ballad with sentimental violin when required, trade Indian or western-influenced solos with the ease of good jazz players, and provide a tight, slinky rhythm section. At the end, Singh reverted to his commentator role. \"My colleagues have behaved well today\" he announced."}, "isHosted": false}}}
