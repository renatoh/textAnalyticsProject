Yet yesterday's convergence of past and present British No1s, together for the first time, may just prove to be critical in the Scot's nascent career. The wildcard pairing had practised together before but having surprisingly parted with his coach Mark Petchey last week, and struggled with injuries and form, Murray was never more in need of wise words. Henman will have imparted many this week. \"Jeremy Bates helped me when I was coming up, although obviously I was a little bit older than Andy,\" Henman said yesterday. \" I think a lot of it is on the mental side of things.\" Henman and Murray clearly enjoyed their doubles, even though they lost to Fabrice Santoro and Nenad Zimonjic, the No3 seeds. \"Yes it was good, though I was a bit disappointed with Tim's first volley,\" joked Murray. The Scot now moves on to Barcelona for next week's clay-court tournament and will revisit the Sanchez Casal academy, his alma mater, where he may seek a new coach. \"I don't want to rush anything,\" he said. \"I might make a decision before Rome or Hamburg, or maybe just before the French Open.\" Maybe Tim? \"I don't think he could afford me,\" Henman smiled. Henman is next scheduled to be at Masters events in Rome and Hamburg, although if he fails to get direct entry because of his ever-falling ranking he is unlikely to try and qualify. Roger Federer brushed aside Benjamin Balleret, a 23-year-old Monegasque, 6-3, 6-2 and today plays Spain's David Ferrer whom he has defeated on all three previous occasions, conceding only 11 games. Rafael Nadal, the title holder and seeded to meet Federer in Sunday's final, also reached the last eight with a 6-3, 6-3 win over Belgium's unheralded Kristof Vliegen, who mixed patience with aggression to considerable effect."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
