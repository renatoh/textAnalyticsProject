The organisers of the Glastonbury music festival are trialling an innovative new system to deal with the 700,000 gallons of human waste produced by the event's revellers. Aquator Group, a water treatment company based in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, is providing Glastonbury with a portable sewage treatment plant that will arrive at the site in Pilton, Somerset, on June 21. The size of a small lorry, the ultra-compact system has already been tested successfully overseas. Over the weekend of June 27-29, the population of the site, at Worthy Farm, grows to 150,000, the size of the city of Bath, and produces the same amount of sewage. All the waste is held in Glastonbury's famous lagoon, located near one of the campsites. In previous years, it was carried away by tankers after the end of the festival. Throughout the event, vacuum tankers transfer the waste from the site's 3,000 loos to the lagoon. Last year, it took 157 tankers to empty the lagoon, carrying the waste over a total distance of 10,000 miles at a cost of \u00a3150,000. But this year, the new system, to be installed next to the lagoon, will allow some of the sewage to be treated on site, producing environment agency-approved water that can then be disposed of directly to land or nearby watercourses. The treatment plant is expected to deal with around 25% of the festival's sewage during the trial run, saving around 40 tanker-loads. As of next year, Aquator expects its system to process all of Glastonbury's sewage. John Shearlaw, a press officer for the festival, said: \"Glastonbury is a completely unique situation - a city suddenly appears, and it's a big job. There are a lot of jokes at Glastonbury about the toilets, but this is a real breakthrough. \"Our long-term aim is complete sustainability on site, not having to have tanker-loads of sewage taken away.\" About one-tenth of the size of a standard sewage plant, the system uses the latest technology to process waste into a product that is close to the quality of drinking water. The process is odourless, and Aquator's proposals engineer, Dave Lock, has high hopes for the future of the technology. \"It will be perfect in countries like Japan where space is at a premium, and could also be used on ships so they don't have to discharge their waste into the sea,\" he said. Bob St Barbe, Glastonbury's infrastructure manager, said: \"The system is like converting water into wine. \"It's going to save us money and will lead to less pollution: last year we had large tankers driving around with our waste. If all goes well, soon we won't need them.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
