United have asked them to play in a showpiece game in which the new quadrants of the stands will be officially opened. The Premiership runners-up have received encouraging feedback but are still waiting for an official answer before announcing the return of Beckham, an occasion which would be guaranteed to fill the new-look stadium's 74,800 seats. If, as expected, Real do accept the invitation it will be the first time the England captain has come up against Sir Alex Ferguson since the acrimonious falling-out that led to the midfielder's drawn-out departure in June 2003. Many United fans believe the team has never been as refined since he left but the paradox is that he will not be guaranteed a favourable reception. Indeed, United's supporters now serenade Cristiano Ronaldo with a song that contains a derogatory reference to the previous wearer of the No7 shirt. Barcelona were initially asked to fulfil the fixture on August 9 - 10 days before the new Premiership season - but the European Cup winners pulled out after arranging a trip to the US. Milan were next to be invited but could not guarantee their availability which, in hindsight, will be of relief to Ferguson given that Ruud van Nistelrooy, another player given the Beckham treatment, is tipped to end up at the Serie A club after the World Cup."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
