It is to see the faint star cluster M41 with theT naked eye. Catalogued by Charles Messier in the late 18th century, M41 is a collection of about one hundred stars in a volume about 25 light years across. It lies at a distance of around 2,300 light years from Earth. The chart shows the star field around M41 at midnight tonight looking south-west from London. Follow a line from Orion\u2019s belt to the bright star Sirius. Then gradually shift your awareness to the location of M41 \u2013 it should appear as a faint smudge in your peripheral vision, which is more sensitive to faint objects than your direct view. Observers in the southern hemisphere should look north-east. From Sydney, it should be easier to catch M41 because it will be higher in the sky than from London."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
