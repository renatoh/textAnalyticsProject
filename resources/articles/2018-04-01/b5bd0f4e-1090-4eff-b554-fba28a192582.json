Trump, who spent much of the 2016 campaign alleging massive voter fraud, returned to the topic at the event in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia. \u201cIn a lot of places, like California, the same person votes many times,\u201d said Trump. \u201cYou probably heard that. They always like to say \u2018that\u2019s a conspiracy theory\u2019. It\u2019s not a conspiracy theory, folks. It\u2019s millions and millions of people and it\u2019s very hard because the state guards their records.\u201d There is absolutely no evidence for such voter fraud occurring. After winning the electoral college in 2016, Trump falsely claimed that he would have won the popular vote as well if not for fraud and created a controversial commission to investigate voter fraud in the United States. He also harped on the danger posed by illegal immigration and by the \u201ccaravan\u201d of refugees travelling to the US from Central America in an effort to seek asylum. \u201cWomen are raped at levels that have never been seen before,\u201d Trump claimed of the caravan as he referenced his infamous 2015 remarks when he launched his presidential campaign that Mexico was deliberately sending murderers and rapists into the US. \u201cEverybody said, oh, he was so tough. I used the word rape,\u201d said Trump, as he reflected on his comments then. Trump touted his proposal for a border wall and for increased enforcement of immigration laws. He also claimed that the MS-13 gang had gained control of swaths of Long Island, requiring towns to be \u201cliberated\u201d while gang members get thrown into \u201cpaddy wagons\u201d \u2013 a term found offensive by some Irish Americans. The event featured Trump sitting in between two of the three main candidates for the Republican nomination for US Senate in West Virginia. On Trump\u2019s right was congressman Evan Jenkins and on his left was the state attorney general, Patrick Morrisey. The third candidate, the convicted former coal company executive Don Blankenship, was not present. Trump spent much of the event criticizing the Democratic incumbent, Joe Manchin. Trump also offered new details on the scope of the mission to strengthen security at the border after announcing earlier this week that he wanted to send in the military to \u201csecure\u201d the border from what he described as an escalating threat of undocumented immigrants, drugs and crime flowing into the US. The administration intends to mobilize between 2,000 and 4,000 national guard troops to the US-Mexico border in an effort to boost security there, Trump told reporters on Air Force One on the trip back to Washington DC. He said the troops would remain at the border until a \u201clarge portion\u201d of the wall is built, an effort that could take years to complete. Asked about the cost of deploying thousands of national guard troops, Trump said the administration was still \u201clooking\u201d at it. Trump meanwhile on Thursday took credit for a record-low drop in unlawful border crossings from Mexico. \u201cBecause of the Trump Administrations actions, Border crossings are at a still UNACCEPTABLE 46 year low. Stop drugs!\u201d he tweeted. Trump also weighed in on the allegations against the EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt, who has faced questions in a series of scandals about his use of government money as well as his lodging in a property owned by a lobbyist. Trump told reporters on Air Force One Pruitt \u201chas done a fantastic job\u201d, adding: \u201cI think he\u2019s done an incredible job. He\u2019s been very courageous. It hasn\u2019t been easy, but I think he\u2019s done a fantastic job.\u201d He added of the reports about Pruitt\u2019s conduct: \u201cI have to look at them \u2026 I\u2019ll make that determination.\u201d Trump\u2019s statement was a comparative vote of confidence after a White House spokesman, Hogan Gidley, said earlier on Thursday: \u201cI can\u2019t speak to the future of Scott Pruitt.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
