This is Irn-Bru maker AG Barr's formula for combining with the much larger, but more sluggish, Britvic. Very impressive too \u2013 AG Barr chief Roger White has played his hand skillfully. His investors will have 37% of the combo, which is an accurate reflection of the two companies' stock market standings but is a big overachievement for the Scots on other measures, especially turnover. But Britvic's investors are in no mood to complain: their share price rose 12% versus Barr's 8%. \"Compelling industrial logic\" sounds like bad news for somebody's head office (probably Barr's) but you know what the two sides mean. In the drinks game, there have traditionally been large savings when distribution systems and buying clout are combined. Just ask Diageo, which reaped a rich harvest after Guinness and Grand Metropolitan merged in 1997. Barrvic, or whatever it will be called, can play out the same script in miniature. It will even have Gerald Corbett, GrandMet finance director in those days and Britvic chairman now, heading the board. Has Corbett short-changed his shareholders? Probably not. After the Fruit Shoot recall, Britvic shareholders wanted to see signs of life and the Barr merger qualifies. It's not as if Corbett had a free hand to explore alternative deals. Britvic bottles Pepsi under licence in the UK and Ireland and PepsiCo can veto a change of control \u2013 it would probably object to, say, a private equity owner. Moreover, if PepsiCo itself was interested in buying Britvic it surely would have done so years ago. This is a deal that looks like that rare thing: an all-share merger where nobody is unhappy. Under-fire Britvic chief executive Paul Moody even gets a quiet exit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
