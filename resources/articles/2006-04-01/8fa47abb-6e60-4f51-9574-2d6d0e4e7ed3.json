But the politics of the region are never exactly stable and so it is brave of Damien Hirst to wade into the arena. Come September, the artist who described the 11 September attacks on New York as 'kind of like an artwork' and said that the terrorists 'kind of need congratulating' is to headline a major exhibition that is being planned for Bethlehem in the Palestinian Territories by an organisation called Art School Palestine. 'Most Palestinians are unable to travel due to the Israeli occupation,' explains a spokesman. Therefore the event aims to bring international art to the people. The exhibition will include works by artists from around the world, including three other Turner prize winners, Martin Creed, Wolfgang Tillmans and Douglas Gordon. Called As if by Magic, the exhibition is intended to spotlight Palestine as a potential venue for what organisers describe as 'contemporary cultural exchange'. When Pendennis ran into the show's curator, Charles Asprey, at an event sponsored by Perrier Jouet champagne, he declined to comment further on the enterprise, but I understand that - tellingly - none of the artists will be compelled to visit Palestine in person. 'They've been asked to create art which can then be assembled by other people in Bethlehem,' says a source. 'But the whole enterprise is clearly going to be seen as a grand gesture of support from these artists, and the modern art community in general, for the Palestinian cause.' Desperately seeking Gordon Gordon Ramsay seems to have been deserted by his charitable spirit. Eighteen months ago, a lucky banker bid \u00a33,000 to have lunch with the great chef in a Times auction for good causes, but Ramsay is proving elusive. According to Giles Coren, who writes restaurant reviews for the paper, he and Ramsay were auctioned as a job lot. 'I thought, I'm going to come lowest in the staff auction unless I rope Gordon in as a package deal of lunch with both of us, then I'll come top and can tell myself they were bidding for me. But 18 months later I can't book Gordon,' Coren told me at a debate hosted by the National Portrait Gallery. 'I've suggested a few dates but I can't get him to commit.' I say, I say, I say Gerald Ratner, who resigned from the family jewellery chain after describing some of their products as 'crap' in a speech, has just joined the lucrative after-dinner speaking circuit. In an interview in Business Life magazine, Ratner explains: 'I do a speech at least once a fortnight.' With that new jewellery business just getting off the ground, minefield isn't the word. Presumably, they all aim to please The Department of Culture, Media and Sport is taking aim at the Home Office over handgun legislation, with the battle already causing tension in ministerial circles. Because of rules introduced after the Dunblane massacre, Britain's Olympic shooting teams are unable to train on home soil and a special exemption has to be sought for the shooting event at the 2012 Olympics. Sports Minister Richard Caborn has written to the Home Office to ask if our teams can train at home. 'Hazel Blears, who is in charge of such matters at the Home Office, is said to be opposed to any change,' says my source. The patter of more tiny Tory feet Cycling hats - or whatever the Cameroon Tories are wearing these days - off to Ed Vaizey, pictured, and his wife, who are expecting their first child. 'I can't claim that, like many of my colleagues, it's an election baby because we only got married last September,' he tells me. 'But I think it may have been conceived on a trip to India with the Conservative Friends of India, so I suppose it's a junket baby.' The trip was not funded by the taxpayer, but his paternity leave will be. 'I certainly will be taking leave,' he adds. 'Because it coincides with Tory conference.' Madge starts a chain reaction The trouble surrounding Madonna's decision to open a company called Semtex Girls rumbles on. Having contacted Pendennis a fortnight ago to point out that they own the copyright on the word Semtex, a soft drinks company called Siber-East Ltd has now decided to 'embark on a promotional campaign in the UK as well as extending the name Semtex to certain other classes of merchandise'. Whether this was always the company's intention is unclear. They do, however, hint that they may sell the name Semtex for a suitable sum should anyone else feel like taking on Madge in the courts. Titmuss tattle John Leslie's former girlfriend, naughty nurse Abi Titmuss, is to publish a book. Readers will remember that Leslie was brought low when Ulrika Jonsson alleged in her autobiography that she'd been raped and he was (mistakenly) believed to be the culprit. At the time, loyal Abi stood by him, only to dump him afterwards. Now she's spilling the beans. According to her publisher Abi's tome is not a memoir, but 'an illustrated book about how she went from being the girl next door to a glamour girl'. Neither this, nor the mischievous revelation that it will include 'private photos' is likely to reassure Leslie much, as he waits for it to appear on the shelves at the beginning of September. pendennis@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
