Kevin Curran, the general secretary of the union GMB, said the Tories were trying to make an insidious link between immigrants and disease: \"That is the sort of outrageous message I would expect to hear from the BNP, not a supposedly mainstream party. It's time to accept our public services and economy will rely on migrant labour in years to come.\" While the Liberal Democrats warned of the \"very dangerous\" direction the Conservative campaign was taking, Labour unearthed quotes from Andrew Lansley, the Tories health spokesman, last July describing such checks as \"unethical\" and \"unnecessary\". Case by case Labour's immigration minister, Des Browne, was careful yesterday not to launch an all-out attack on the Tory plan which was first unveiled under Iain Duncan Smith in 2003. Instead he made it clear that the government has decided to implement its existing powers to introduce targeted health screening for TB in high-risk areas. Those diagnosed will need to seek treatment before being allowed to enter Britain. The Conservatives want to go further. They want comprehensive health screening of all migrants from outside the EU coming to Britain for more than six months, not just for TB but for other infectious diseases including HIV/Aids and Hepatitis B. While those with TB will be automatically banned, those who test positive for other diseases will be excluded on a \"case-by-case\" basis. Asylum seekers are to be exempted. TB rates Health Protection Agency data yesterday confirmed the Tory leader Michael Howard's claim that TB rates have risen in Britain by 25% in the last 10 years to 7,000 cases a year, with two-thirds involving people born abroad. HPA research also confirms that 75% of heterosexuals with HIV in the UK were infected in sub-Saharan Africa. But health professionals say the jury is still out on whether compulsory health screening is reliable enough to form the basis of a policy under which people will be denied entry. They say a policy of compulsory tests now has all the sophistication of the New York immigration officers on Ellis Island who sent Jewish migrants back to eastern Europe in 1892 because of a typhus epidemic in Brooklyn. They argue that TB can remain dormant in an infected person for years and any such tests must cover those going home as tourists, visitors or on business, to be effective in protecting public health. Although two-thirds of those diagnosed areforeign-born the studies show that they are not necessarily new arrivals. At present testing is carried out on new arrivals at Heathrow and Gatwick. After 185,000 checks only 100 cases of TB were found, far below the 150 cases per 100,000 tests the chief medical officer expected. This is further evidence that the growth in TB in Britain is fuelled more by those who have already settled here than by new arrivals. One-off screenings may not detect disease in those who frequently travel back to their country of origin. Reliability A recent study by Dr John Coker for the Institute of Public Policy Research also cast doubt on the reliability of the TB tests, saying they were essentially the same chest x-rays familiar in the 1940s and 1950s and throw up many \"false positives\". Banning those who test positive from coming to the UK could prove rough justice. The IPPR also argues that the potential stigma associated with HIV testing may drive such migrants \"underground\" which would lead to a mistaken sense of public health security. Health screening could be useful if it is seen as a \"welcome health check\" to ensure that the NHS meets the needs of new migrants. But as a way of banning people from Britain to keep infectious diseases at bay it may prove far less effective."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
