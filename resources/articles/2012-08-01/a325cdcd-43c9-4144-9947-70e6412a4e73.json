All that warmth, goodwill, and tears, even at the bloody taekwondo. It was getting tiring. Now we can get back to more familiar territory. Like murder. Which you don't have to wait too long for in Ruth Rendell's Thirteen Steps Down (ITV, remember?). I wonder how Rendell came up with the profession for Mix, her protagonist. Hmm, shall I make him an accountant, or a carpenter ... no, got it, he will be a gym-equipment repair man, specialising in cross-trainers. Anyway, it's an excellent job for him, with a touch of perviness and good access to gyms \u2013 ideal for a stalker. And Luke Treadaway is brilliant in the part, a thoroughly convincing weirdo psychotic obsessive. The murder \u2013 the first, I fear there may be more to come in part two \u2013 is horrid (yeah, as opposed to those really nice ones). Not a strangling, as favoured by Mix's serial-killer hero John Christie (of 10 Rillington Place); Mix suddenly and terrifyingly loses his rag and bashes new girlfriend Danila over the head with a torch until her lights are well and truly out. Rarely can a dead person have looked so utterly dead. Then under the floorboards she goes. Big mistake, Mix; schoolboy error. Never put the body under the floorboards, that's one of the first rules of murder; just you wait, it'll come back to haunt you. Possibly literally. Well there's something pretty creepy going on in this house, up that final dark flight of stairs. (Is that the 13 steps? I didn't quite get that.) And then, when Mix sees (a bit more) sense and decides to bury poor Danila in the garden, up there in the top window, the face that appears gothically in the lightning flashes ... [Shudders]. Who is it? Mix's stepfather, who used to hit him? The half-sister Mix once tried to attack with a bottle of ketchup? John Christie himself? One of Christie's victims? We'll find out in the conclusion. There are subplots and loads of loose ends to tie up. Whatever happens, I don't think it's all suddenly going to be fine \u2013 oh, it's just another lodger up there, we forgot to tell you, meet Roger \u2026 that's not going to happen. No, there's a gnawing sense of foreboding and dread, bad shit ahead. I particularly worry for Nerissa the model, Mix's stalkee. Impressive then \u2013 tense, taut, and murky. With fine performances all over the place. It's nice to see Rendell's work back on the screen. And a good one for ITV to announce the fact, after two weeks in the wilderness, that they do in fact still exist. The Riots: In Their Own Words (BBC2) was less successful. Actors speak the words of the people interviewed for this paper's \u2013 and the LSE's \u2013 Reading the Riots study. So many actors, so many people ... you don't really get to know anyone. And there's little sense of narrative, of how the events unravelled. So it doesn't really work as drama. Perhaps it wasn't meant to. What it is then is a kind of compilation, My Riot, on shuffle. And not only does it not add anything to the reports that have appeared in this paper, but nor is it nearly so comprehensive. Perhaps the sheer volume of material made it almost impossible to turn into a cohesive hour of television. But it's a bit like they smashed their way into Foot Locker, got bewildered by choice, and came out with two left shoes. One Nike, one Adidas. Different sizes. Yeah, shut up now. Wow! Escape from Colditz (Channel 4)! What an AMAZING story. In the second world war, it was considered a moral duty for captured British officers to try to escape, and they came up with the most ingenious \u2013 and insane - schemes to try to achieve it. This has to be craziest of all. Jack Best, Bill Goldfinch and a bunch of their chums built a glider out of floorboards, bedsheets and porridge, obviously. A system of pulleys and a falling bathtub was to catapult them from the castle roof to freedom. They never got to try it out, though. The war spoiled everything by ending. Jack and Bill \u2013 showing uncharacteristic prudishness \u2013 chose to walk out of the gates instead. Now a team has rebuilt it, albeit a remote-control version (bloody health and safety). And it works! Kinda. I wouldn't have enjoyed that landing \u2013 quite bumpy. But then I would almost certainly have just stayed in my cell, sitting the war out, amorally."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
