Fifteen years ago, he told his partner that he was falling in love with him and wanted them to move forward as a couple. His partner fled, moving across the country. The end of the relationship was especially painful for Levine. At the time he was a student at Columbia University in New York, where he is now assistant professor of clinical psychiatry. He was working in a therapeutic nursery programme, helping mothers with post-traumatic stress bond with their children. Through it, he became fascinated by the science of adult attachment. In the 1950s, the influential British psychologist and psychiatrist John Bowlby observed the lifelong impact of the earliest bonds formed in life, between children and parents, or primary caregivers: attachment theory, which has been widely researched and drawn upon since then. There are three major styles of attachment: secure, anxious and avoidant. When Levine came across attachment theory as a student, no one seemed to have applied it to adult romantic relationships but he immediately saw the relevance to his own heartbreak. His boyfriend had an avoidant attachment style. It was a revelation to Levine; now he knew why their relationship hadn\u2019t worked. \u201cIt didn\u2019t make it less painful, but I could understand it better. I was surprised that no one had taken those concepts and translated them into something that people could use.\u201d For 15 years, he has been doing just that, at Columbia, in private practice, and as an author. With his friend and fellow psychologist Rachel Heller, Levine wrote Attached, a practical guide to harnessing adult attachment theory to find lasting love, described by its authors as \u201cthe manual we wish we\u2019d had when we were dating\u201d. The idea is that by recognising your type you can identify a suitable partner, be more conscious in your relationships and stop self-sabotaging. \u201cIt\u2019s not you, it\u2019s my attachment style,\u201d may sound like a gift for commitment-phobes, but the response to Attached suggests it has really helped people, says Levine. First published in 2010, the book has been updated to include stories from readers who found it \u201ca profound relief to discover that their needs for closeness are valid\u201d. There is an assumption that everyone has the \u201ccapacity to love in the same way\u201d, says Levine, but our attachment styles act like programming: \u201cIt goes much deeper than communication \u2013 it affects our perception of the world, without us really knowing it.\u201d A person\u2019s attachment style is largely influenced by whether or not they bonded successfully with their primary caregivers \u2013 parents or otherwise \u2013 in childhood, though more recent research suggests that genes, and our romantic history as adults, may also be influential factors. Analysis of studies in North America and Europe found that roughly 25% of the population are avoidant, and 20% are anxious. Anxiously attached people tend to be overly preoccupied with their partners and whether they love them back, while avoidants equate intimacy with a loss of independence and deploy distancing strategies. (You can find out your type by doing the quiz at AttachedTheBook.com \u2013 if it is not immediately obvious.) Learning about which style they are can change people\u2019s lives, says Levine: \u201cThey are stopped from doing the same thing that hasn\u2019t worked for them.\u201d You are not necessarily stuck with your style: according to a four-year study, one in four people do change over time \u2013 often as a result of a relationship with someone who has a secure attachment style. \u201cSecures\u201d are comfortable giving and receiving love, and gravitate towards partners with the capacity to make them happy. As such, they can happily partner with anxious and avoidant types, and even have a steadying effect on them. \u201cSecure people make you realise there is no threat,\u201d says Levine. He singles out Steve the bartender\u2019s steady pursuit of avoidant Miranda in the HBO television show Sex and the City as the behaviour of an archetypal secure (sometimes he even shows his patients clips from the show). The challenge for those looking for love is that, even though secures make up 55% the population, relatively few are single \u2013 they are just too good at being in a relationship. Anxious and avoidant types are drawn to each other, despite their incompatible styles: as the person seeking closeness works harder to get it, their avoidant partner pulls away, thus reaffirming their separate beliefs that relationships are unfulfilling or restrictive. Levine\u2019s pop culture example is the film 500 Days of Summer, with Zooey Deschanel\u2019s Manic Pixie Dream Girl character a textbook avoidant. People in anxious-avoidant relationships can change their behaviour with introspection and, often, therapy. Cate Mackenzie, a London-based psychosexual therapist, cites American couples therapist Hedy Schleifer\u2019s turtle-and-octopus theory, in which one is inclined to retreat, the other to reach out. Mackenzie says anxious octopuses can be overly critical of avoidant turtles, who may have internalised shame about avoidance. Her aim is to soften their exchange, by encouraging both partners to open up and better understand each other, \u201cto build a new paradigm\u201d. But, she adds: \u201cEven if one person was more of a turtle in another relationship, it can change \u2013 the person with the higher desire becomes the octopus.\u201d Dr Rob Weisskirch, professor of human development at California State University, says attachment theory is a useful tool for understanding nuance in relationships, but it\u2019s also possible to overestimate its importance. It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you are destined to have bad relationships. \u201cThere are plenty of external experiences that can be additive for healthy relationships,\u201d he says. In other words, nothing is set in stone. Attached is mostly geared towards helping people who are still floundering in the dating pool \u2013 particularly anxious types, who are more vulnerable. Avoidants are relatively glossed over, Levine admits. \u201cWe never thought they were going to read this,\u201d he says. Nevertheless, this avoidant found it an illuminating read. Levine\u2019s dating advice is to be upfront about your needs as predetermined by your type, and to try to identify your potential partner\u2019s type. For example, if you recognise that your anxious attachment style means it is important to you that your partner texts back quickly, make it clear early on. How they respond to a relatively low-stakes request will give you a clue to their own triggers. People tend to go with the flow and find out over time, but that initial stage is crucial, says Levine. \u201cWhen it\u2019s left up to chance, you\u2019re lucky if you find someone who is nourishing and helpful \u2013 if you\u2019re unlucky, you don\u2019t. It\u2019s important to be able to ask for what you need.\u201d The \u201cspark\u201d that guides many people\u2019s decisions doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate long-term compatibility, he says. \u201cAnd once you start to like the person, and make them special and unique to you, it\u2019s hard to undo it.\u201d The premium placed on a securely attached partner can create its own pressures. Avoidants often distract from promising romantic prospects by fantasising about \u201cthe one\u201d, while Mackenzie warns that \u201chigh-achieving octopuses\u201d, in particular, can become overly preoccupied with a checklist of traits. Levine is sympathetic to anyone who is struggling to find a partner. \u201cWhen we are in a relationship we tend to forget how hard it is to be alone, to hope to find someone, to go out on yet another date. Even if you\u2019re the one who is rejecting, dating is a very stressful time.\u201d He and Heller make it clear that our choice of partner powerfully affects our ability to thrive in the world \u2013 and that being clear-eyed about your needs in a relationship, and what would make you happy, is the first step towards success.
