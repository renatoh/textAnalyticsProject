Rochelle Clark, 35, came off the bench at The Stoop to earn her 114th cap and level the record for an England player, held by Jason Leonard, as Packer\u2019s late pushover try ensured a winning start to the autumn campaign. \u201cIt was amazing to get the opportunity to run on to the pitch with all the girls looking after me,\u201d Clark said. \u201cI am a teary anthem singer anyway but there was a bit of added emotion for me today. I was a bit nervous on the bench but I got a lot of carries.\u201d Amy Cokayne\u2019s first-half try seemed to have settled things until Christelle Le Duff capitalised on Fiona Pocock\u2019s mistake with six minutes left to level matters at 5-5. Packer, however, ensured Clark\u2019s milestone match ended on a high and though it was a forgettable performance, the result may yet prove significant. On the day England were drawn in the same pool as USA, Italy and a qualifier that looks like being Scotland for the 2017 World Cup, making the defence of their crown begin to loom on the horizon. The Sevens players, now that the Rio Olympics has been and gone, have been reintegrated and, even without Emily Scarratt and Amber Reed, England could still name a squad with 1,000 caps among them. The problem with welcoming back a host of players, primarily to the backs, however is the inevitable rust and ensuing litany of handling errors. Still Katy McLean linked well with her the scrum-half, Natasha Hunt, and, though she missed a routine penalty on 18 minutes, she soon atoned with her kicking from hand. McLean had been eyeing up France\u2019s left-hand corner and eventually forced the mistake that gave away the lineout from which Cokayne went over. Suddenly, cracks were appearing in the French defence. In the closing minutes after Le Duff\u2019s equaliser Camille Grassineau was shown a yellow card for a tip tackle on Pocock. Cue a perfect kick to the corner from McLean and another driving maul, finished off by Packer. Whereas ferocious tackling, led by the No8 Safi N\u2019Diaye, had kept England at bay, now the world champions were finding gaps. A flurry of half-time replacements included the introduction of the usual French captain, Ga\u00eblle Mignot, and prompted immediate improvements from her side but with the help of the TMO, England held firm. Enter Clark for her landmark appearance and just a few minutes later, Cokayne thought she had her second try only to be pulled back for offside. England had weathered the France storm, thanks in no small part to the excellent Alex Matthews but Pocock\u2019s error \u2013 keeping the ball in play only for it to be pounced on by Julie Duval \u2013 allowed Le Duff to score in the right-hand corner. The attempted conversion was awful and shortly after France\u2019s Camille Grassineau, was shown a yellow card for a tip tackle on Pocock. Cue a perfect kick to the corner from McLean and another driving maul, finished off by Packer.
