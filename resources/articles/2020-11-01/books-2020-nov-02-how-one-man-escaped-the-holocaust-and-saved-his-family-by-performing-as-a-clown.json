It was only years later that Horowitz realised his grandfather Michael, known as Kubush, was talking about his own past. A Polish circus entertainer for the famous Staniewski Brothers, he had dodged the concentration camps by performing for the Nazis, before fleeing to the Soviet Union, Africa and eventually Australia. There, he joined the cast of the popular Tarax Show on GTV-9 under the stage name \u201cSloppo the Clown\u201d. \u201cThey never spoke about what happened,\u201d says Ralph\u2019s wife, the Australian author and journalist Sue Smethurst, whose book about her grandparents-in-law\u2019s journey, The Freedom Circus, is out now. \u201cNanna told me: no good comes from looking back.\u201d The Freedom Circus tracks the escape of Kubush, his wife Mindla and their young son Gad from Nazi-occupied Poland. Fleeing Warsaw separately, Mindla was incarcerated in a Soviet prison while Gad was sent to a Soviet orphanage, before both were rescued and reunited by Kubush with the help of his circus partner Faivel \u2013 \u201ca chain-smoking dwarf who can swear in four different languages\u201d. Smethurst never got the chance to meet Kubush, who died before she married Ralph. But she did extensive interviews with Mindla leading up to her death in 2015 at the age of 96. For decades, the family consensus had been to avoid the war years in case they were too traumatic for Mindla. Smethurst insisted \u2013 for the sake of her own two teenage children \u2013 they must at least try to record her story. \u201cIt was very gentle steps with her: I went to visit and took in this little tin of black-and-white photos to see if she could tell me who they were,\u201d she recalls. It became apparent that Mindla \u2013 who was living out her final years surrounded by other Holocaust survivors in a Jewish nursing home in Melbourne \u2013 was confused, rather than upset, by the questions. \u201cWhy are you even interested in this?\u201d she asked Smethurst. \u201cI said: \u2018Nanna, it\u2019s for the family and your story is amazing.\u2019 And she literally pointed a finger around the table and said: \u2018What about her and her and her? Their stories are amazing too.\u2019\u201d Mindla did talk, however, soothed in part by Smethurst\u2019s gifts of bright pink, purple and orange nail polish. \u201cShe was a very proud woman: her hair was done, her lipstick was on, she\u2019d painted her eyebrows on, she was always immaculately done,\u201d says Smethurst. Mindla\u2019s focus on appearance \u2013 as well as pride in her home; the furniture in the \u201cgood room\u201d was covered with plastic \u2013 was in stark contrast to her years spent in the Soviet jail, where she wasn\u2019t even allowed a rag to mop up her own period and the only toilet was a bucket in the corner of the room overflowing with women\u2019s faeces. \u201cThere\u2019s an obvious stripping of dignity,\u201d says Smethurst. \u201cShe was never going to live like that ever, ever again.\u201d Although based on meticulous research, including interviews, newspaper articles and a trip to Poland to retrace Mindla and Kubush\u2019s footsteps, The Freedom Circus is relayed like a novel, in the third person, with Smethurst closely following their actions and thoughts. \u201cWhat would [Mindla] be thinking here? What would she be seeing here?\u201d she remembers asking herself. \u201cI tried to do everything through the lens of her eyes.\u201d This technique has its limitations: without the liberty of true novelistic freedom \u2013 both the ability to play with the facts and with her characters \u2013 profound moments, such as when Mindla sees Kubush for the first time again outside the prison gates, become clich\u00e9d. Other facts are blurred and rely heavily on platitudes, as Smethurst imagines what her characters were thinking at a particular moment or dreaming on a particular night. Some of Smethurst\u2019s most jaw-dropping discoveries are also sidelined. In Melbourne, Mindla thought that only her sister Jadzia, who joined her in the city, had survived. Her father Shmuel and sisters Sonia, Shara and Minya died at Treblinka; her other two brothers, Yakov and Menachem, were also murdered \u2013 or so she believed. Through a service called Lost Histories, which reunites Holocaust survivors and families, Smethurst discovered that both brothers had not only lived but went on to enjoy long lives with families of their own. Yakov, who had been detained in Soviet Union gulags, moved to Israel; Menachem was liberated from Dachau and settled in the United States. Both died later in life thinking they were the only surviving member of their family. In a tragic twist, Menachem retired to Jerusalem \u2013 yet never learned he lived a 40-minute drive from his long-lost brother. \u201cYakov had written out the family history: he had tried to find the rest of the family and couldn\u2019t,\u201d says Smethurst. Jadzia\u2019s daughter Hanna, now in her 50s, grew up believing she was an only child. It was only later, after Jadzia died, that Hanna learned her mother had been married with a child. Both were killed in the camps, and Jadzia never told her daughter she\u2019d had a half-sister. Much of this is relayed in a short epilogue of a couple of pages, while Jadzia\u2019s secret is almost entirely brushed over. Yet, as a reader, I wanted to understand the knotty, complicated emotions of these new discoveries: of the next generation now reunited with family scattered across the world they never knew they had; of Smethurst\u2019s husband; and of Smethurst herself, a non-Jew from the Victorian countryside who unearthed such a treasure trove of lost opportunities and lost conversations. Perhaps Smethurst might write a follow-up book? \u201cI wouldn\u2019t rule it out,\u201d she writes over email a few days after our interview. \u201cThis book was not the end the story \u2013 in many ways, it is just the beginning. I have as many, if not more, questions now than I had when I began.\u201d For now, though, there is The Freedom Circus: the story of a clown who escaped the Nazis and conjured up strange fairy tales for his grandchildren; the story of a man whose tragedy masqueraded as a comedy. \u2022 The Freedom Circus by Sue Smethurst is out now through Penguin Random House Australia"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
