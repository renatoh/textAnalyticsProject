I decided to get a mortgage through a financial advisor and agreed to pay the \u00a3499 arrangement fee upfront. Shortly afterwards I had a homebuyers report carried out on the property that highlighted some serious problems, and I requested a full structural survey. On reading these I decided not to proceed with the purchase. I thought my arrangement fee would then be refunded, but the mortgage lender refused to repay it, calling it a booking fee instead. My financial advisor has since tried to retrieve it but with no success. Please could you advise me on what I should do next - this has been a very expensive experience. JC A It is perfectly normal practice for certain fees paid at the time of a mortgage application not to be refunded if the mortgage does not go ahead. However, a prospective borrower should be made aware of this before paying any money for such a fee. If you weren't told the fee would not be refunded if the mortgage wasn't completed, I think you have grounds for complaint. Given that it seems to be your financial adviser who failed to draw your attention to the possibility you would be out of pocket, I suggest you ask for details of the formal complaints procedure of your adviser's firm, to which you are legally entitled. If you get nowhere with this or you are not satisfied with the answer to your complaint, you are then free to take it to the Financial Ombudsman Service."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
