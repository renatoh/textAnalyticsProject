The result in Paisley, which was Celtic's first league defeat in the town for 21 years and relegation-threatened St Mirren's first win in 12 games, puts Mowbray's position in stark focus. Celtic trail Rangers by 10 points in the Scottish Premier League but the Ibrox team have two games in hand, a state of affairs which prompted angry scenes among the Celtic supporters at full-time. \"I just said to the team in the dressing room that I take responsibility,\" said a shocked Mowbray. \"It is not the first time we have lost four goals this season.\" On his future, the manager said: \"I don't think we need to get into that. Every time you lose a game at this football club it is disappointing.\" The former West Bromwich Albion manager subsequently appeared to question his own tactical approach to games. \"Maybe breaking it down, we need to play slightly differently away from home,\" Mowbray said. \"We had six strikers on the pitch at the death. Rangers have been very consistent and not lost many goals; maybe that is the way to go. Maybe it isn't a league for trying to force games, maybe it is a league for playing defensive football, negative football, and having quality in attack. \"In trying to be positive we lost a few goals. I take responsibility. I left some very young defenders exposed but it was done for the right reasons. There were positive reasons why it was a negative result. By trying to get goals back we made positive substitutions. Sometimes it can backfire and you have to take it on the chin.\" Celtic's board must decide whether to retain Mowbray until the summer, when it is increasingly likely he will depart in any case, or to regard last night's result as a simple sacking offence. If the latter is the case, the coach Neil Lennon would be the most likely candidate to take over until the end of the season. In what was a bittersweet night for Rangers, Walter Smith watched his team bundled out of the Scottish Cup by Dundee United in a quarter-final replay. David Robertson was United's hero with the solitary goal in the dying seconds of the tie.Rangers may have edged a step closer to the title after events in Paisley but their treble dream is no more. \"Obviously the Celtic result is a good one for us but we still have football to play before we claim the championship,\" cautioned Smith. \"I was disappointed to lose so late in the game but what happened in the first game at Ibrox was costly for us; we were 3\u20131 up and should have seen the tie out.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
