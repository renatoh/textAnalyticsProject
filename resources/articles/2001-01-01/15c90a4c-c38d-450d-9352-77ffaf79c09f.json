Only one out of the fourteen films funded by the Lottery has ever made a profit according to Heat magazine. 1999's film adaptation of Oscar Wilde's An Ideal Husband (pictured), which starred Rupert Everett and Minnie Driver, managed (but only just) to make it into the black, while all the others came in at a loss. \u0095 Gwyneth Paltrow, Heather Graham and Renee Zellweger are apparently battling it out to star in the Hollywood remake of the 1996 French comedy, When The Cat's Away, in which Garance Clavel played a lonely bachelor girl whose life is transformed when her cat runs away. Although Heather Graham was originally penned in to star in the \u00a330m remake which will be set in New York, both Paltrow and Zellweger have now declared an interest. An insider told ananova, \"Heather thought she had this wrapped up if Miramax got the deal but they are also very close to Gwyneth and see Renee as possibly the best female comedy star around.\" \u0095 Hollywood rumours suggest that Mike Myers will reprise his role as Austin Powers for one last time. Myers is apparently in talks to star in a prequel to the two previous Austin Powers films and is keen to get veteran Avengers actors Patrick Macnee and Honor Blackman to play his parents."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
