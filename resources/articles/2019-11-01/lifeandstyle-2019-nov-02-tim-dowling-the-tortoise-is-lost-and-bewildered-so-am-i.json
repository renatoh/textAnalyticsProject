The sky is dark; the rain so unceasing that I keep a waterproof top in my office shed just for the purposes of making the 10-yard journey to the kitchen. On the return leg I see the tortoise sitting under a dripping sage bush, limbs retracted. On my next trip back I take him inside for the winter. The tortoise has his own views. Instead of eating the lettuce I put out for him, he makes two furious circuits of the kitchen table and then stands by the garden door, nose pressed to the glass. I push the door open to show him the driving rain. \u201cLook,\u201d I say. \u201cMiserable.\u201d The next time I see him, he\u2019s back under the sage. After two more days of rain, I bring the tortoise indoors again. \u201cWinter\u2019s coming,\u201d I say. \u201cYou need to deactivate.\u201d He spent the last two winters under the oven, but this year we have a new oven with no underneath. He prods its solid base with his front foot, and then looks up at me, as if to say: is this a joke? \u201cYou might like it under the washing machine,\u201d I say. I leave a trail of lettuce in that direction, but the tortoise only follows it halfway, before returning to the oven to try to stare a hole through it. My wife walks in with a collection of dirty mugs and narrowly avoids tripping over him. \u201cWhy is he there?\u201d she says. \u201cHis worldview has been shattered,\u201d I say. \u201cWe\u2019re going on a walk with everyone tomorrow,\u201d she says. \u201cAlong the river.\u201d \u201cIn this?\u201d I say, pointing at the window. \u201cTomorrow\u2019s meant to be nice,\u201d she says. \u201cAnyway, I said we\u2019d only do half. We\u2019ll meet everyone else at the bridge.\u201d The next morning, the sun is shining when I wake up. I find the tortoise stomping round the kitchen table. He stops when I enter the room, and fixes me with a looks that says: hey, Lettuce Guy \u2013 what time do you call this? \u201cThe clocks went back,\u201d I say, pulling two lettuce leaves from the fridge and tossing them on to the floor. \u201cI know it\u2019s confusing.\u201d At midday Greenwich Mean Time, my wife and I catch a southbound train. Forty minutes later, we emerge from an unfamiliar station, and I freeze in bewilderment on the crowded pavement. \u201cWhich way?\u201d I say. \u201cDownhill,\u201d my wife says, setting off. I follow her. We reach the river 20 minutes ahead of schedule, and take up seats outside a pub to stare at the water. \u201cWhere are we meeting them exactly?\u201d I say. \u201cHere,\u201d my wife says, pointing at the ground. \u201cDon\u2019t we want to be the other side of the bridge?\u201d I say. \u201cNo,\u201d she says. \u201cSouth.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t mean which bank,\u201d I say. \u201cI mean east or west.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t really do compass points,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s north,\u201d I say, pointing. \u201cThat\u2019s west. The sea\u2019s that way.\u201d My wife looks at me, and blinks twice. \u201cCorrect,\u201d she says. We head off down the road, in an easterly direction. \u201cThis way we\u2019ll intercept them after they cross over,\u201d I say. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I got so turned round,\u201d my wife says. \u201cI\u2019ve lived in London all my life.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s easily done,\u201d I say, trying to sound sufficiently patronising. We find a bench on the other side of the bridge, where I enjoy my triumph in silence, the sun warming my closed eyelids, for almost five minutes. \u201cHang on,\u201d my wife says. Even before I open my eyes I realise that she was right and I am wrong. It is a terrible, if not entirely unfamiliar sensation. \u201cWe\u2019re coming now,\u201d she says into her phone, as we stomp back to our original position. \u201cWe were on the wrong side.\u201d \u201cMy mental map was upside down,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault for not remembering that you don\u2019t know anything,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d I say. \u201cI do,\u201d she says. \u201cFor a bit.\u201d I look along the glittering river, attempting to reconstitute it as a mirror of itself, but it\u2019s impossible, like trying to stare a hole in to an oven."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
