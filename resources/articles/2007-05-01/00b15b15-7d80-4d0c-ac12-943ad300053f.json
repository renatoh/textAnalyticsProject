News that BBC Worldwide is to take a 25% stake in soon-to-be-ex Granada drama chief Andy Harries' new indie Left Bank Pictures is starting to cause a bit of a stir. Harries has an outstanding creative track record - from Cold Feet to The Queen and much else besides - but setting up an indie from scratch is a risky and expensive business. So you can see why an equity investment from BBC Worldwide in exchange only for what is described as an \"exclusive first look deal\" to distribute the company's programmes (ie the money doesn't have to be paid back) might look attractive. But there are issues - especially for the BBC and other players in the wider independent production marketplace. For a start there are the potential conflicts of interest. This deal is unprecedented in the UK. BBC Worldwide has invested in plenty of independent production, destined for the BBC and elsewhere, but it has never taken an equity ownership stake. Helen Jackson, BBC Worldwide's director of independents, is responsible for all its dealings with UK indie producers yet as a director of Left Bank Pictures she will be on the board of one of them. And no matter how straight a bat she plays, it will be hard to shake off the perception amongst the rest of the indie sector that she and Worldwide are favouring that company. As a director, Jackson will also be party to the company's dealings with all the BBC's (and Worldwide's) competitors. And when it comes to securing the best interests of Left Bank, she will on occasion have to connive in either forcing the BBC to pay more for programmes of potential interest to other broadcasters, or in actually delivering them to the competition. This will no doubt really improve relationships with BBC Worldwide's main client - BBC Vision. Then there is the tendency for the senior management of Worldwide to do whatever is necessary to demonstrate that their decision to buy 25% of this company was correct. And whether that results in behaviour in the best interests of the licence payer only time will tell. In any case, by taking a stake in company that will supply other UK broadcasters, isn't this a back-door way of getting around the rules preventing the BBC producing programmes for its British rivals? Then there is the potential impact on the nascent independent distribution marketplace. Independent distributors have long complained of being beaten to deals by BBC Worldwide's largesse. What's more, Worldwide already distributes most BBC production around the world as of right. That leaves other distributors almost wholly dependent on independent production. The prospect of BBC Worldwide buying into companies in order to tie up distribution rights to their programmes - were it to do that systematically - would probably sign the death warrant for many independent distributors. Worldwide says there are no similar deals pending. That may be true, but out in the marketplace it is known to have been in similar discussions with a number of other indies. And then there are the licence payers. Because we don't know how much Worldwide paid for its 25%, or on what terms it can sell out and realise the value of the stake, we really don't know whether it's good value for us. Last but by no means least there's the talented Andy Harries. In the short term he gets the cash he needs to start his business. But, longer term, his room for corporate manoeuvre will be restricted and being tied to BBC Worldwide - in the eyes of competitors and even some inside the BBC - might just make his life harder. Does C4 profit from new media? At C4's annual results presentation chief executive Andy Duncan revealed that new media had generated a turnover of \u00a350.6m (up from \u00a324.5m in 2005) and a profit of \u00a313.5m - up from \u00a30.3m. He praised the sector as an important contributor to C4's performance now and in the future. So far so good. But read the Ofcom-commissioned LEK report on C4's finances and the message is clear. New media investments must be regarded as \"speculative\" and the business model \"has not yet been proven.\" So which is it? Inquiries reveal nearly all the \"new media\" profit in the annual report is from premium-rate telephone calls to shows. New media? Not really. \u00b7 Email your questions for our media agony uncle to media.faq@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
