Even the chef from Lancashire omitted to mention the most illustrious of them all: Benedictine and hot water \u2013 or \u201cBenny and Hot\u201d as it is popularly known. This most effective winter warmer is not only a delight to quaff but is also taken for everything from the common cold to croup, a seasonal draught which is a remedy and a drink with an illustrious social history. When soldiers of the East Lancashire regiment were injured in Normandy during the first world war they were hospitalised in the Benedictine distillery and given Benny and Hot daily as a restorative. They were so astounded at its taste and properties that they brought news of it home. Burnley Miners Social Club is now the distillery\u2019s largest customer and is famous throughout the north for its effects on miners\u2019 lung disease and horrendous hangovers \u2013 it often acts as a Sunday stiffener.
