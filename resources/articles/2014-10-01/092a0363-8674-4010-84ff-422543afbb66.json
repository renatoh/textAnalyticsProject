So it\u2019s worth asking the question: how many guns are there in Australia, and how many of these are illicit? The Australian Crime Commission (ACC) conducted an investigation into illegal firearms in 2012 and has presented some of the unclassified findings in its submission to the Senate inquiry. The ACC submission identifies multiple \u201cmarkets\u201d for firearms in Australia. The licit, or legal market, is comprised of all guns that are registered and held by a person with a licence. Then there\u2019s the grey market, comprised of rifles and shotguns that weren\u2019t registered or surrendered under the National Firearms Agreement in 1996. The illicit market contains both grey market guns and guns that have been illegally imported, illegally manufactured or transferred from the legal markets in some way, such as by theft. The ACC estimated there were over 250,000 rifles and shotguns and 10,000 handguns in the illicit market in 2012. For comparison, there were some 2.75m registered guns held by 730,000 licence holders. So the number of illicit guns is just under a tenth of the legal ones. The ACC does, however, point out that estimating the size of the illicit market is inherently difficult given the clandestine nature of gun trafficking, so the actual number of illegal guns may be significantly higher or lower than this. Another report into firearm trafficking in Australia by the Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC) examined the composition of the illicit market and looked at how guns were obtained. The AIC report analysed records for 2,750 firearms seized by police between June 2002 and October 2011 in the national firearm trace database. Of the guns seized, most were long-arms (rifles and shotguns), with a mix of restricted and nonrestricted weapons. Restricted guns are defined as those that would be subject to the 1996 buy-back. The grey market was by far the largest source for both restricted and nonrestricted long-arms, at 92% and 86% respectively. This represents unregistered guns that have been diverted into the illicit market in some way. For handguns, the sources were completely different, with the highest source of guns being false deactivation and theft. Deactivation is when guns are rendered incapable of firing, which in some states means the guns are no longer tracked and deregistered. Criminals can then potentially return the guns to working condition. The theft of guns and security of storage is on the inquiry\u2019s agenda. Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie downplayed the issue by saying only six handguns had been stolen in Victoria in 2013-14. However, figures from the Australian Institute of Criminology show there were 525 firearms of all types stolen in Victoria in the same time period. The last national total of gun thefts is from 2008-09, and puts the total figure at 1,570."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
