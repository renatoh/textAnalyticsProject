Conservative and Liberal Democrat peers, backed by at least some Labour ones, inflicted a 237 to 156 defeat on the government over the measure, a majority of 81. Although peers have admitted they cannot defeat the government bill in full, since it was a government manifesto commitment, insisting on the publication of the of all detailed costings will further exacerbate the row over the cards. Whilst the government has insisted the cards will only cost around \u00a3584m annually, the most senior group of independent experts, at the London School of Economics, would cost \u00a310-19bn over the first 10 years. Unless MPs can defeat the amendment when the bill returns to the Commons, it means that the home secretary, Charles Clarke, must give a report to parliament, for approval by MPs, containing a detailed account of the revenue and capital costs arising from the legislation with a statement of expected benefits. It would also be subject to review by the national audit office. Researchers for the LSE, and peers today, complain they have had almost no information out of government departments on the likely costs of the ID scheme. In language stronger than is usual in the upper chamber, Tory peer Baroness Noakes, who was behind the amendment, said peers had \"failed to get any useful information out of the government\" regarding detailed costings. The issue has already sparked a war of words between the government and the most senior independent experts on the issue, with home office minister Andy Burnham today accusing critics of \"bouts of scaremongering\" over the likely costs. The government insists that a joint biometric passport and ID card would costs a combined total of \u00a393 to citizens - a figure rejected by outside experts. Simon Davies, of the LSE, said: \"There has been a culture of secrecy which has developed at the Home Office. \"As the scheme has progressed it has been progressively impossible for the Home Office to actually release crucial data, not just to us but to parliament.\" He said the LSE stuck by a report published in June which said the scheme would cost up to \u00a319bn - more than three times the government's estimate, but he said that since then ministers had watered down the proposals. \"What was originally promised was a secure, fully-inclusive, universal system that had comprehensive goals. \"Now it has become a low-security, fallible system, [where] government departments can just buy in at whim. This is a radically different beast.\" Experts such as Mr Davies also point out that, if current funding for the project is met by revenue, it could also mean private firms and even the public sector making high charges for each \"accreditation\", or reading of the card to confirm identity, to recoup costs of scanning machines. But Mr Burnham said the government figures had been checked by commercial accountants KPMG, who concluded they were \"robust and appropriate\", and that a full release of commercially sensitive data would risk failing to get the best deal for the taxpayer. \"We can't just put all the figures out in the public domain because that may lead us not to get the best deal for the taxpayer. We have said what it will cost to produce a biometric passport and a biometric identity card. \"The LSE's figures are based on a number of assumptions which just don't hold. There are a whole range of ways in which they have inflated the figures to come out for a newspaper headline of \u00a3300 for identity cards. It didn't stack up.\" The government had shown it was prepared to listen and other amendments meeting peers' fears had been tabled. \"We are listening still. We are making sensible amendments where the bill needs to be amended but I hope, in that spirit, we will take forward a scheme that everybody can be united on.\" Shami Chakrabati, director of Liberty, the civil liberties pressure group, said today: \"This bill is as expensive to our rights and freedom as to our wallets.\" As the Lords debated the controversial identity cards bill, Mr Clarke faced calls from his own backbenches to look again at the plans. But Mr Clarke said the scheme would help in the fight against crime. \"Identity fraud costs the economy at least \u00a31.3bn a year and the evidence shows that the threat is rising. \"The ID card scheme will tackle the problem by recording biometric information so that we are able to detect people who try to register multiple identities to commit fraud or for other worse purposes. Mr Clarke added, to some Tory jeers: \"As the arguments about both costs and about the security of the system and the need for it have become more widespread and better understood, support for ID cards has increased. \"It is a critical measure to enable us to provide security for the people in this country and we shall proceed with it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
