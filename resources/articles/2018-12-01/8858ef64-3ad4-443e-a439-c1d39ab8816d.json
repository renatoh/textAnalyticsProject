Billy Connolly\u2019s Ultimate World Tour was the latest and gentlest of all, broadcast just after the 76-year-old comedian announced his retirement from live performance. This new travelogue \u2013 which is also a look at previous travelogues, which is to say it is partly a clip job \u2013 tracks his adventures and thoughts as he makes his way through Florida (where, he explains, he now lives since his Parkinson\u2019s disease made the brutal New York winters too much of a risk to his health) down to Key West. He goes fly fishing off Florida Keys with his friend Will Benson; just sun and sky above and gently rippling waters below. \u201cSome people never experience this silence,\u201d says Connolly. \u201cYou do it for the nothingness, really. It refuels you.\u201d The 25-year tradition of him never catching a fish on camera continues unbroken. We cast back to another trip, through Scotland, as he and his friends troop back down an uncooperative loch. They have all got the giggles. Everyone around Connolly has always got the giggles. \u201cYou\u2019re wondering where all the fish we caught are,\u201d says Connolly sagely. \u201cThey\u2019ve been stolen. Thieving bastards.\u201d Then it was on to gaze in delighted awe at the Key West Extension, part of Henry Flagler\u2019s rail network that became known as the Florida East Coast railway. The extension connects Key West to the mainland by, among many other feats of engineering, at one point crossing a seven-mile span of open water. It took 4,000 men seven years to complete. \u201cNot enough time is spent these days,\u201d says Connolly, \u201cshowing you how amazing people are.\u201d He met the people who, in the Everglades and elsewhere, co-exist with crocodiles in their gardens and he met Chris Guinto \u2013 a crocodile response agent who helps the crocodiles (a protected species, unlike alligators which are an altogether more vicious proposition) that get into swimming pools and other predicaments. \u201cThat body is perfected,\u201d says Chris as the two men gaze happily at one lazing on someone\u2019s backyard dock. \u201cThe only difference from the days when they were eating T rexes is that they\u2019re smaller, because their food sources are smaller.\u201d Connolly met the people having fun as the remaining members of the tongue-in-cheek Conch Republic, leftover from the day in 1982 when the city of Key West vented its frustrations at local government by briefly seceding from the US. Their official stringed instrument is the conchalele, which made it possibly the most perfect place for Billy Connolly on Earth. Though that crown probably goes to Loch Lomond. Over footage of Connolly gazing out over that beautiful, implacable place, Connolly at home quoted Scott:\u201c\u2018This is my own, my native land \u2026\u2019 Sometimes your love for the place just has to find a stage. I\u2019d like to die there. I wouldn\u2019t like to stay away for ever.\u201d There was an unmistakably elegiac quality to the programme, underscored \u2013 wittingly or unwittingly \u2013 by the clips of shows from years past enshrining what has been lost; not his curiosity, his charm, his warmth, his wit (or his ability to play conchaleles) or any of the truly important things, but mobility and the antic energy that was once a defining feature of his performances as a standup and a presenter. The contrast now between his unmoving face and endlessly expressive voice, forever on the verge of laughter, is hard to ignore. What saves it all from becoming too unavoidably an obit-in-waiting is the fact that Connolly remains absolutely himself. What has been stripped away \u2013 as much by age as by illness \u2013 just lets the stillness, the kindly hippy happy to enjoy the world and hope the best for it, stand more clearly revealed. So he may never go running naked round Orkney again, as he did in 1994. Or as he did in the Arctic in 1995. Or in Australia in 1996. But it does not matter because he can still teach us the most important lesson: you must not do it if you are fit. \u201cIf you\u2019re in shape, it\u2019s like you\u2019re showing off. If you look like a tortured question mark like me \u2013 it\u2019s funny.\u201d This is his own, his native land."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
