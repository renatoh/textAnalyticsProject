Pavel Dmitrichenko, who specialised in dancing villainous roles at the theatre, is on trial in Moscow and faces 12 years in jail if he is convicted of masterminding the attack. Sergei Filin was splashed in the face with sulphuric acid outside his Moscow flat in January and has undergone 23 operations in an attempt to save his sight. Also on trial are Yury Zarutsky, who is accused of throwing the acid, and Andrei Lipatov, the alleged getaway driver. Dmitrichenko said in court that he admits \"moral responsibility\" for what happened, but denied either suggesting or sanctioning an acid attack. He is due to give his version of events to the court in the coming weeks, but the Observer has seen several letters written by Dmitrichenko to a dancer at another Moscow theatre, who has been corresponding with the suspect since he was detained in March. The handwritten letters, written in blue ballpoint pen from Dmitrichenko's pre-trial detention cell, have several passages scrubbed out in black ink by the prison censor, but include passages in which the dancer speaks of police pressure on him to confess to the crime. In one letter, he claims that investigators have admitted they believe his version of events but are powerless to act. It reads: \"The investigator himself says to me, 'I know that you wanted F [Filin] to be hit once, because he insulted women, but you have to understand, Pasha [Pavel], this is a high-profile case, and we will be forced to give you at least some kind of sentence. If we don't, everyone will be removed from their posts for keeping you in prison for half a year.'\" In a Russian television documentary aired in recent days, Dmitrichenko also spoke publicly for the first time about the circumstances of the attack. He said Zarutsky wanted help getting his young daughter enrolled in the Bolshoi school and, when he heard of Dmitrichenko's annoyance with Filin's management style and supposed sexual indiscretions, offered to \"have words\" with the artistic director as a favour. \"He [Zarutsky] said, 'I am going to talk to him [Filin], and if he doesn't listen, then I hit him once, and he'll have a bruise,'\" said Dmitrichenko in the interview, filmed inside his detention centre. \"I agreed, and that was my mistake.\" Dmitrichenko said that when he heard of the acid attack he realised what had happened and started shaking. He claims he confronted Zarutsky in horror and suggested that they both went to the police to explain everything, but Zarutsky cut him off: \"He grabbed me by the neck and said, 'If you go to the police, I'll do the same thing to your girl.'\u2009\" Filin appeared in court earlier this month, when he was questioned for more than three hours, including by Dmitrichenko himself. At one point Filin broke down in tears. Dmitrichenko told him he was sorry for what had happened, but insisted that he was only \"morally\" responsible. He also accused Filin of carrying on a number of affairs with Bolshoi ballerinas and of handing out prime roles \"through his bedsheets\" or for bribes. Filin strenuously denied these accusations and painted a picture of Dmitrichenko as a petty, vindictive man who was obsessed with the fact that he and his partner, Anzhelina Vorontsova, were not given due recognition. Vorontsova, also a dancer at the theatre until she left during the summer, was obsessed with dancing in Swan Lake, but Filin thought she was not ready, the court heard. Filin has now gone to Germany for another major eye operation. In one of the letters, Dmitrichenko claims he was assaulted by policemen before one of the preliminary hearings and describes the extent of the alleged ill-treatment: \"Of course it isn't nice when you are put with your face against the wall, with your hands handcuffed behind you and big guys in masks, three policemen, start to beat you, on your kidneys, liver, head \u2026 When I got back after the court case I felt sick for two days. I had strong concussion, my hands were bruised from the handcuffs. I had a bruise under my eye. It was painful to walk and to breathe.\" The police have denied using physical force against Dmitrichenko, stating recently: \"Dmitrichenko more than once provoked police officers, behaved aggressively, was confrontational and did not carry out the lawful demands of police officers.\" The acid attack is one of a number of scandals to hit the Bolshoi, Russia's premier theatre, in recent years. Over the summer, the theatre's general director, Anatoly Iksanov, was fired and the new head has tried to draw a line under the scandal-hit past. Last week there was further bad news for the Bolshoi as an American dancer in the corps de ballet told a Russian newspaper she had been asked for $10,000 (\u00a36,200) if she wanted to dance solo roles. The theatre denied the allegations. More of the Bolshoi's dirty laundry looks set to be aired as Dmitrichenko's trial continues. Future witnesses expected to take the stand include Vorontsova, Iksanov and Nikolai Tsiskaridze, an outspoken former premier dancer who is a vocal critic of the theatre's management and was asked to leave over the summer. Finally, it will also involve cross-examination of Dmitrichenko himself. \"It is impossible to scare or morally break me, let them kill me even,\" he writes in one of his most recent letters. \"I am going to tell the truth nevertheless, and I don't intend to admit to the charges that they are trying to put on me.\" The trial continues on Monday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
