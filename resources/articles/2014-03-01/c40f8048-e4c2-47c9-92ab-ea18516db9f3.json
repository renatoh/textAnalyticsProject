The wings were at Hartpury College together and have remained in touch. If they are picked in their respective sides \u2013 they have started in all three rounds \u2013 it will be the first time they have been on opposite teams. \"I am good mates with Jonny and I am glad he is doing well,\" says Cuthbert, who was born in Gloucestershire and started playing rugby in his second year at Hartpury, after excelling at football and show jumping. \"It will be exciting if we are both selected: I see him when I go back to Gloucester and I might send him a little text in the week. \"Give Jonny a yard and he is gone: he will score from anywhere, as he has shown for Gloucester. England have a dangerous back three who will cause problems if you kick long to them and give them time and space. Mike Brown is playing with confidence, playing in his preferred position after being on the wing last year.\" It will be Wales's final trip to Twickenham before the World Cup group meeting between the sides there next year, but Cuthbert feels there will be enough at stake to ensure no one gives any attention to a match that is 18 months away. \"It is one game at a time,\" he says. \"Getting the win on Sunday is all that matters with the Six Nations title at stake. You can see it as a stepping stone to next year, I guess, and the result could give someone the upper hand \u2013 but the World Cup is a long way away. Both teams are improving and by the World Cup will be at their peak.\" Wales's 19-12 victory at Twickenham two years ago earned them the triple crown, a target for England this time. \"It was my fourth Test and it was a tough, close affair, decided by Scott Williams's late try,\" Cuthbert says. \"It will probably take a bit of magic to win it again. What happened last year has no relevance: England are a different team now. And it will be about who turns up and wants it more.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
