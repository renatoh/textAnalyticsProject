Walters scored both goals in the 2-0 win as Martin O\u2019Neill\u2019s team joined England, Northern Ireland and Wales in qualifying for next summer\u2019s tournament. O\u2019Neill identified the Stoke City forward as Ireland\u2019s outstanding performer during the qualifying stages but Walters said it was a victory for the team\u2019s collective spirit. \u201cThere was a whole team of heroes out there,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got there in the end and it is the best moment of my career, in any shirt. To qualify for the European Championship finals is unbelievable. You\u2019ve got to take in the atmosphere because these moments don\u2019t come around in a career very often. The management team deserve lots of credit \u2013they have been excellent throughout the campaign.\u201d Walters opened the scoring with a first-half penalty and then doubled Ireland\u2019s lead in the 70th minute to set up a 3-1 aggregate win. \u201cWalters has had a qualifying tournament to remember,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cThere have been a number of fantastic performances and fantastic performers and I think Walters has topped the lot. He has been exceptional.\u201d O\u2019Neill added: \u201cI couldn\u2019t be more proud because they are a fantastic bunch of players. They all want to play for their country. That\u2019s important because you hear that some players find it a chore playing for their country. Well, I\u2019ve not experienced that at all in my two years. \u201cThey gave everything. I don\u2019t think they had anything left to give at the end. The spirit has been so strong. We may lack an occasional piece of absolute genius but we\u2019ve been great. We deserve to go and that moment when the referee\u2019s whistle went, and we\u2019ve reached France, was just very special. I thought the Germany game [winning 1-0] was wonderful but I think it was eclipsed tonight. And these are the moments you live for.\u201d O\u2019Neill also praised his assistant, Roy Keane, describing his appointment as the best decision he has made since taking the job. \u201cI\u2019ve had to make many big decisions. The biggest was bringing in Roy Keane and he has been absolutely phenomenal. I couldn\u2019t be more delighted with him. He\u2019s an iconic figure. He sometimes polarises opinion but not in the dressing room.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
