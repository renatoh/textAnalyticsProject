Delivering the high profile Dimbleby lecture, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, said PCs or even community support officers were more likely to be the first to confront a terrorist. Sir Ian highlighted the failed July 21 bombings as a case in which the presence of a neighbourhood policing team could have resulted in his force being alerted to the plot sooner. He also used tonight's lecture to warn that Britain remained a target of \"the highest possible priority\" for al-Qaida. \"Every community is at risk, which is the starkest of reasons why we need representatives of every community in our ranks,\" he said. There must also be an \"open debate\" about police tactics for dealing with suicide bombers following the mistaken shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes, he said. Sir Ian, the first police officer to give the prestigious Dimbleby lecture since 1973, used his address to call for a \"widespread, fundamental debate\" about policing as a whole in the wake of the July 7 bombings. In the lecture, to be broadcast on BBC1 later tonight, he says: \"What we should seek to avoid, at all costs, is a separation of local, neighbourhood policing from either serious criminal investigation or counter terrorist investigation. \"Every lesson of every police inquiry is that, not only the issues that give rise to anti-social behaviour, but also those that give rise to criminal activity and to terrorism begin at the most local level.\" Referring to the example of the July 21 attempted attacks, he says: \"A local authority worker identified the flat which three men shown on the CCTV images had frequented: this was the bomb factory. \"However, he also mentioned that he had found dozens of empty peroxide bottles in the waste bins. \"Had we had one of our neighbourhood policing teams in place then he probably would have told us about what he had found. Peroxide is the basis of the bombs. \"Thus national security depends on neighbourhood security. It will not be a Special Branch officer at Scotland Yard who first confronts a terrorist but a local cop or a local community support officer. \"It is not the police and the intelligence agencies who will defeat crime and terror and anti-social behaviour; it is communities.\" Sir Ian described the death of Mr de Menezes, an innocent Brazilian who was shot dead after being mistaken for a suicide bomber, as a \"watershed\". Discussions about the use of lethal force by police officers must no longer be allowed to take place \"behind closed doors\", he warned. The Commissioner outlined his vision of a \"holistic\" police service, which could deal with everything from \"truancy to terror, from graffiti to gunmen\". However, he warned that the financial cost of having to \"do it all\" would be \"very expensive\" and asked whether people would be prepared to spend the money. Sir Ian said the question of \"what kind of police service do we want?\" had not been properly considered for almost two centuries. There was now a \"new urgency\" to the debate about the nature of policing, which was just as important as health, education, transport, the environment or the military, he said. In the lecture, he says: \"We are told the police ought to do this particular thing or are bad at doing that: people praised us, for instance, on 7th July and then for catching the failed bombers so quickly: we were savaged after the death of Jean Charles de Menezes and over Soham and Stephen Lawrence. \"But there is little dispassionate, thought through, public examination of just what it is we are here to do in the 21st century - to fight crime or to fight its causes, to help build stronger communities or to undertake zero tolerance, nor of how these things should be done or what priority each should have or what we should stop doing. \"The silence can no longer continue. The citizens of Britain now have to articulate what kind of police service they want.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
