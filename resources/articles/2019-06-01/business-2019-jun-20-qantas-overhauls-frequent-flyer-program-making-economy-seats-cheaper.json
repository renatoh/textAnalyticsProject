In what the airline described as the \u201csingle biggest overhaul\u201d to the frequent flyer point system since it was established, the national airline has rebalanced the scales in favour of the cheap seats. International economy seats will cost up to 10% less in points, effective immediately. But more points will be needed soon to get business class seats \u201cto better reflect the value of this premium experience\u201d. Premium bookings will cost 15% more, and upgrades will cost 9% more. These changes will come into effect on 18 September. Qantas\u2019s chief executive, Alan Joyce, defended the increase: \u201cIt is the first increase in 15 years and the product has improved a lot in that time. We still think this is good value for money.\u201d The complaints from members under the old system were not about point requirements being too high, but about the extra cash fee of the carrier charge, and the lack of availability of seats for busy dates and routes. Joyce said this was what the changes targeted. Qantas is also cutting the cash payment you have to pay when booking a flight using points \u2013 known as the carrier charges \u2013 by up to 50%. This would save an average $200 in cash for an international flight, modelling shows. For example, an economy flight from Melbourne to Los Angeles previously would have required 90,000 points and $513. Now it will cost 83,800 points and $393. But premium economy on the same flight will cost 18,600 points extra. That flight used to cost 144,000 points and $793. From September it will cost 162,600 points and $603. Business class from Melbourne to LA used to cost 192,000 points and $943. Under the changes it will cost 216,800 points and $703. The chief executive of the loyalty program, Olivia Worth, said the 18,600 increase was still in reach of average \u201cbronze and silver flyers\u201d. \u201cMany of our members are in the high hundreds of thousands, so these flights are very attainable for them,\u201d she said. Qantas\u2019s frequent-flyer program has 12.7 million members and it processes four redemption flights and one upgrade a minute. Thirty-six per cent of all credit card expenditure is on a Qantas-branded or affiliated card. Joyce said the changes would cost the airline $25m a year. There will be also more options to book economy seats using points, with more seats available and across more routes, by partnering with new airlines. \u201cMore seats, fewer fees and better value,\u201d Joyce said. The airline will also launch a new system, Points Club, that gives membership based solely on points earned \u201con the ground\u201d through purchases. This would be for people who earn points when \u201cthey shop at Woolworths or go see a movie at Hoyts\u201d rather than flying, Olivia Wirth said. Currently 70% of frequent flyer points are earned through purchases and bookings, Joyce said, rather than flying. The airline will also introduce \u201clifetime platinum\u201d, reached when a person accrues 75,000 status credits. Wirth said this would take roughly two decades of flying at platinum one, but it was \u201caspirational\u201d and a \u201chigh bar\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
