In ordinary times, being a doctor is a matter of privilege and pride. I\u2019d like to think that I give generously, mindful that one day I will lean on others. But my risks have just multiplied. \u201cDid they teach you this in medical school?\u201d someone asks. No. I don\u2019t think that anyone predicted that the entire world would be struck down by the same incurable infection at the same time. We go to sleep believing one thing and awake knowing another. The rolling redundancies are devastating. The ranks of the disenfranchised will swell. Mental illness is spiking. Worryingly, so is domestic violence. Each day, I walk in to the wards, still filling with patients. Of course, being negative for the newest disease doesn\u2019t mean everything is fine \u2013 patients still have their \u201cold\u201d problems \u2013 organ failure, cancer, dementia and falls. In a situation where we don\u2019t know when a patient can return for follow-up, every decision must be doubly deliberate. Later, I attend my oncology clinic. Urban doctors like me are new to telehealth. Many patients are elderly, not fluent in English and not internet-savvy. If I can manage to reassure them and not invoke more fear, it\u2019s a godsend. Once clinic ends, we move to long-term planning, deciding how to treat all our patients safely and fairly. Cancer is onerous at the best of times; now, there are additional layers of complexity. As others stay home, doctors and nurses, cleaners, theatre techs and secretaries are coming to work. Our car parks are full. And yet, there\u2019s not even a whisper of self-congratulation \u2013 we\u2019re simply doing what we undertook. I am touched by the number of offers of help. Fortunately, I don\u2019t need supplies, rent assistance or a job. But if I may, here is something you can do. Please stop constantly second-guessing and ridiculing the Australian government officials, health authorities, and public health experts at the forefront of managing this unprecedented crisis. Self-appointed experts have thrust themselves everywhere, declaring outrage at every step, criticising the advice of the chief medical officer, his deputies and anyone whose view they disagree with. From testing criteria to elective surgery, from protective gear to unproven therapies, a cacophony of voices is drowning out authoritative advice. \u201cAuthoritative\u201d may be an exaggeration in swiftly changing times and a democratic society should welcome debate rather than a slavish adherence to rules but the truth is when we are all unsure, it is important to let people do what they are trained to do but hold them accountable. Global experience tells us that there is no single formula for diverse nations. I have clinical acumen but it\u2019s no use pretending that I have any real public health expertise or insight into the levers of government. What works for my patient won\u2019t help the population. From the comforts of Melbourne, I can\u2019t posit what should happen in Darwin, much less Manhattan or Mumbai \u2013 and I suspect it\u2019s the same for most of us. So, in the midst of so much noise, I need a clear space to listen to local experts who not only have access to the data but also the capacity to integrate rapidly multiple moving pieces. These people have training in infectious diseases, public health, epidemiology, statistics, economics and government and are working day and night for the common good. I decline to vilify them or lampoon their decisions and I hope you will too. In 2004, I was a disaster-relief physician in the tsunami-ravaged Maldives and witnessed the difficulties of coordinating a mass medical effort. The world poured in billions of dollars in aid. Unlike today, the threat had passed, only recovery mattered. On an island without a hospital, I needed oral antibiotics, asthma inhalers and pain relief. Instead, I got anaesthetic, a desalination plant and mouldy bread. The best intentions are useless in the absence of cool, considered minds. Another reason to trust the experts. For many of my colleagues, staying calm is becoming decidedly harder in the face of constant messages being generated by highly anxious individuals fuelling our worst fears. Let\u2019s face it, we are all watching this pandemic with disbelief. But blaming and emotive commentaries shared on personal and professional groups, with an \u201cintent to vent\u201d, or \u201csimply discuss\u201d have very real consequences \u2013 they rattle even the most stoic and steady professionals. This week, I need to focus on the children in quarantine while their mother is dying. And the patient whose cancer is progressing. And the man who can\u2019t give his beloved wife a funeral. I want to protect my interns who aren\u2019t sleeping well through this baptism of fire. But I have limited bandwidth and the more time I spend distinguishing real concern from confected outrage, the less time there is for the things that really matter. Universal healthcare isn\u2019t perfect but is again revealing its strengths. A central command structure is cutting through the noise and delivering the most up-to-date, evidence-based information. Our public hospitals are working non-stop to keep up with change. In swiftly changing times, we must excuse our leaders the occasional stumble but realise the gift of calm and consistent leadership. So no matter who you are, please take a minute to ask yourself how your next private or public post or media commentary will add value to the societal response to the pandemic. How will it encourage people to play their part? Will it tell us anything new? Could someone already be working on your concern? This is not a call to muzzle debate but a plea that outrage always travels faster than methodical thinking. Anxiety is absolutely reasonable but if we are honest, we must own our anxiety, not spread it. Opinion should not be disguised as expert advice. It isn\u2019t merely irresponsible; it can do harm. The greater your audience, the greater your responsibility. From my vantage point, the future is unclear but the navigation is reliable. Speaking to doctors around the world, this in itself is no mean feat. There will be another time to reflect on whether the government and health experts got things right and use those learnings to inform the next response. Until then, letting them get on with their job is the most important thing you can do to help me do mine. \u2022 Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar.
