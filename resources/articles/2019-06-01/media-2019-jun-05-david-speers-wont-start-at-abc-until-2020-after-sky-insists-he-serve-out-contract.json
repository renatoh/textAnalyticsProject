Almost two weeks after Guardian Australia revealed the political journalist had accepted an offer to join the ABC to replace Barrie Cassidy, Sky News broke its silence and admitted Speers had resigned. Sky News chief executive officer Paul Whittaker said Speers would continue on-air as political editor and anchor of Speers and Speers on Sunday until the end of his contract early next year. \u201cDavid is an exceptional and highly respected journalist and one of Australia\u2019s most insightful political interviewers,\u201d Whittaker said. \u201cHis highly decorated career has seen him chosen to host leaders\u2019 debates and forums at the last six federal elections, as well as cover the last four US presidential elections.\u201d The ABC welcomed Speers and said its journalists Annabel Crabb and Fran Kelly would fill in for him on Insiders for the remainder of the year. Cassidy\u2019s farewell show is on Sunday 9 June. Speers, who has remained silent on his defection until now, revealed he never missed an episode of Insiders. \u201cInsiders is essential viewing if you\u2019re interested in politics and understanding how Australia is being led,\u201d Speers said. \u201cI never miss it. To be able to take over from a legend, Barrie Cassidy, and present the program is an honour and a terrific opportunity.\u201d Speers, who lives in Canberra, will move to Melbourne where the program is produced and will work with executive producer Sam Clark. ABC news director Gaven Morris said Speers was a worthy successor to Cassidy. \u201cDavid is a terrific journalist and presenter, an astute political observer and a great talent,\u201d Morris said. \u201cHe joins Australia\u2019s best and most trusted political journalism team.\u201d Whittaker said Speers had made an outstanding contribution to Australian journalism and Sky News and wished him well. The 44-year-old, who has won two Walkley Awards, an AACTA Subscription Television Award, a Kennedy Award and ten ASTRA Awards, is taking a pay cut of some $200,000 to join the ABC. He is the highest paid presenter at Rupert Murdoch\u2019s pay TV operation, where sources say he is on $680,000. Widely admired for his razor-sharp interviews with politicians, Speers has managed to keep his reputation as a fair minded journalist despite being the face of the right-wing channel."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
