The report forecasts a 20% increase in the number of part-time male workers by 2024, with a rise of only 7% for part-time female workers. For full-time workers, it forecasts an increase of 7% for women but only 3% for men over the same period. Flexibility is becoming attractive to men who are trying to balance their family and work life, said Lesley Giles, research director at UKCES. She said: \u201cThe increase in men working flexible hours has been catalysed by the right to shared parental leave, but seems to be gaining traction. Coupled with other changes, like the growth of jobs in sectors traditionally dominated by women, this could represent a real change in the way people work and the way we understand gender roles in the labour market. \u201cWhile part-time work is most common in low-paid professions and is largely dominated by women, this report shows the first signs of that trend changing.\u201d Employment growth is estimated to be particularly strong in the professional services, IT and other highly skilled occupations. There will be an expected 2m jobs added to these sectors over the next 10 years. Simon Allport, north-west senior partner at Ernst &amp; Young, who has himself chosen a flexible work pattern, said: \u201cFlexible working is a source of competitive advantage to employers. It helps companies to attract and retain talented individuals.\u201d With the government\u2019s shared parental leave policy enacted a year ago, the report highlights the contrast between gender priorities. The men in professional or managerial roles now want to spend more time focusing on family life while the women in similar roles are becoming more career-driven. Despite the projected increase in men working part-time, overall the female labour force is expected to expand faster, reflecting the growing number of women entering the workforceand the rising pension age for women."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
