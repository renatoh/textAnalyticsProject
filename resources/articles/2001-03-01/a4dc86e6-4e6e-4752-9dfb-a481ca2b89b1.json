For as lacking in living-museum-heritage as it may be and as cold, grey and rainy as it often is, by God it has shopping. Okay, so that first bit might be an urban myth but you don't come to Milan for lazy days exploring piazzas and palazzos. If, on the other hand, it's high-fashion shopping that you're after, there is no better place in the world. And if you're going to do it, you might as well do it properly. Which is why I find myself checking into the Four Seasons on a tiny sidestreet linking Via Montenapoleone and Via della Spiga. In London terms, this would be like having Bond Street and Sloane Street on your doorstep. All-important when you only have a weekend - and the stores are, for the most part, closed on Sunday and Monday mornings - you just tumble out of the well-appointed doors and straight into any number of Italian designer emporia. Your most taxing decision of the day will be which way to turn first - left on to the ferociously fashionable Montenapoleone or right on to the slower-paced but equally chic, pedestrianised della Spiga. So well placed is the Four Seasons that it attracts the fashion industry's finest. Gucci head honcho Tom Ford was booked into a room just along the corridor from mine, and ubermodel, Mark Vanderloo was practically a permanent fixture in the lounge bar. Legendary shopper Elton John likes to check into a suite here whenever he's in town and Gianni Versace used to dine at its swish Il Teatro restaurant. Not surprising since the Versace villa is just along the road - look out for the telltale Medusa heads on the doors. It follows then that you can't beat this part of town for people watching. The so-called Golden Triangle - Montenapo (as it's nicknamed), della Spiga and Sant Andrea - is the setting for a good deal of preening and posturing. Especially on a Saturday afternoon when fiercely stylish women in spikey heels and fur coats, and imposing couples with perfectly groomed dogs stalk from exclusive boutique to exclusive boutique. In Paris, it may be fashionable to parade tiny lapdogs but in macho Milan they brandish brutes. In Dolce &amp; Gabbana, on Via della Spiga, a woman disappeared to the changing room to try on a silver-thread pinstripe suit while her pair of fine pedigree dogs lazed on a zebra skin rug in the middle of the store. When she finally emerged she summoned them with a loud clap of her hands. You will be scrutinised, too, so if you want to be taken remotely seriously (or unless you have the skin of a rhino), make sure you're dressed up to within an inch of your life. On my first day, a Milanese woman checked out my bag so aggressively I feared I was about to be mugged. With prices up to a third cheaper than the UK, all those covetous Italian labels (plus American ones such as Donna Karan and Calvin Klein whose tailoring is made in Italy) suddenly seem dangerously accessible. Dangerously so since because it seems churlish not to take advantage of the apparent savings, it's easy to get whipped up into a frenzy and spend your way into bankruptcy. Enduring classics such as Emporio Armani suits are currently around \u00a3300 (compared to about \u00a3425 in the UK), JP Tod's driving shoes are around \u00a3106 (about \u00a3160 here), Prada nylon and leather bags around \u00a3180 (\u00a3250) and Hogan leather trainers around \u00a3126 (\u00a3169). Visit during the sales (January and early July), and there's a further 30% off. But be prepared to have nerves of steel. The prices may be conducive, but the assistants are not always as welcoming. Actually, they can be terrifying. I had a truly bizarre experience in an empty branch of Prada. As I moved from room to room I was followed by a posse of assistants. Then, when I paid for my purchases at the cash desk, they formed a semi circle around me. Perhaps it's better to do as the Japanese do and shop in packs, so you can sweep in and out without fear of being intimidated. But that's not considered chic. A local woman told me with disdain that Japanese tourists queue outside Gucci at 8am during the sales. What she left unsaid was that the Milanese would never do anything so unstylish. That said, the sales assistants are so accustomed to foreign visitors treating their city as one giant shopping mall that they'll whip out a calculator and work out the price conversions for you. When the well-heeled locals start to wilt under the strain of big-budget spending, they make a stop at Cova. This genteel tearoom on Montenapoleone is the place to be at around 5pm on a Saturday afternoon. Bypass the crowded bar area and make your way to a table in one of the high-ceilinged, crystal-chandeliered siderooms. Then you can linger for as long as you like over mini pastries and coffee. If it's high fashion you want, there's no need to venture outside of the Golden Triangle, although it would be a shame not to explore further afield. A walk (or tram ride) along the via Manzoni will take you past La Scala and into the fantastically ornate Galleria Vittorio Emanuele. Borsalino, the most renowned hat shop in the world, stands at its entrance, the windows filled with such delights as a pink suede scooter helmet with rhinestone studded strap. Around the corner is the famous Savini restaurant, which lists a wonderfully quaint Lunch For Ladies In Shopping on its menu. And, from here, it would be madness not to pop through to the Duomo. Even the most hardened shopper couldn't fail to be impressed by its gothic majesty, although it's a shame about the tannoyed music blaring around the square. Milan's stockhouses - outlets that sell surplus designer stock - have also been attributed jewel-in-the crown status recently but unless you're a diehard bargain hunter, they're not the gems they seem. Unlike the US concept of outlet shops, they mostly resemble giant jumble sales with no logic to the layout in terms of sizing or labels and no changing rooms to try anything on, leaving shoppers to strip off in the aisles. If that's your bag, then you'll love the likes of Il Salvegente (Via Fratelli Bronzini) and Vestistock (Viale Romagna). But why forgo indulging in all the frippery the boutiques have to offer, with their work-of-art interiors and over-the-top tissue paper and ribbons, in favour of scrabbling about for last season's cast-offs? My own attempts at this were pretty disastrous. The first venue I went looking for no longer exists, the second had hugely disappointing stock and the third was a veritable mad house. I beat a hasty retreat to the Emporio Armani superstore on via Manzoni instead. A far better bet for cut-price chic is to forget the designer label altogether and try the multitude of high-quality leather goods stores. Soft leather tote bags in black, camel or berry can be picked up for a very reasonable \u00a360. In the arty Brera district, in particular, there are countless fashionable, mid-priced shoe shops doing their own version of Prada et al. There are more bargains to be had at the Viale Papiniano market next to San Agostino metro. Get there early on a Saturday morning (it opens at 8.30am) for the first drop off of designer stock, but otherwise look out for the no-logo leather bags and cashmere sweaters. There's also a stall that sells good quality leather gloves for under a tenner. Unfortunately, the woman who runs it has despotic tendencies - she won't allow customers to try on anything they pick out for themselves and insisted the pair she chose for me were black when they were clearly brown. Across the road from the market, 1 via Modestino is a handy address to know. Reputedly this is the year to be seen wearing Maxmara, and Arris is a discount outlet for the brand. Unlike a stockhouse, this is set out like a real store with orderly displays and even changing rooms. Every permutation of black trouser is available, from stretch jeans to cashmere pants, and they start at \u00a330, so snap up what you can. I didn't and I'm still regretting it. One metro stop away, at Porta Genova, is Naviglio, a rough-around-the-edges canal-side area, home to the many young models who flock to Milan for work. Despite the grim, chilly day and the overwhelming greyness of the buildings, the raw charm of this artisan district is apparent. As yet unsullied by yuppy apartment developments, it's populated by second-hand shops, delis and the kind of leather goods stores that have craftsmen working away in the background \u00e0 la Pinocchio's Gepetto. With countless bars and restaurants along the length of the canals, it's a buzzing place to be on a Saturday evening. It's also great for Sunday lunch. We stopped at Pizzeria Tradizionale at the head of the Grande Naviglio on Ripa di Porta Ticines. Despite its slightly naff name it was heaving with trendy locals, and no wonder as the food turned out to be fantastic: wonderful fried artichokes, seafood pasta and delicious pizza. Then, with moments to spare before I left, I spotted it. The item of items. The icing on the cake for all the Armani, Prada, Tod's... in the window of a small shop called Borgo Albino sat a pink, slim, ostrich skin belt with diamante buckle. It was without doubt the sort of lucky-find purchase that would have friends back home salivating. But the shop was closed and I had luggage to pack and a plane to catch. So, somewhere on the via Alzala Naviglio Pavase there remains a belt with my name on it.
