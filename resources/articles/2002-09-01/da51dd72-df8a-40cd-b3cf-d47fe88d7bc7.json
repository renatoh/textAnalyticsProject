Their sole interest is convincing you to buy a home as quickly and for as high a price as possible as this will mean a fatter and faster commission for them. Never forget this. Register your details with as many agents as possible in the area where you are looking. However, you should try to stick to those who have signed up to the National Association of Estate Agents' code of conduct (www.naea.co.uk). You may be overwhelmed with property details, but if you have briefed your agents well about your budget and needs, they should be able to filter out the completely inappropriate properties. Agents have the infuriating habit of pushing properties on people that are way beyond their budget. If an agent continues to do this, they are just wasting your time and you should take your business elsewhere. Don't just drop in on estate agents unannounced. Try to book an appointment so that they can spend some time listening to your needs. Saturdays are extremely busy days for most agents and it is unlikely that they will have time for you if you just breeze in looking for instant service. Watch out, too, for property misdescription. There is a law against it, but the odd fabrication inevitably creeps into property details. Take all descriptive terms, such as \"in need of modernisation\" and \"compact and bijou\", with the pinch of salt that they deserve."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
