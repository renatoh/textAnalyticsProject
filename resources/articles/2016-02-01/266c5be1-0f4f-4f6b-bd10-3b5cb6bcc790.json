From conversations with rival supporters to the colourful stamps on his fan mail, the winger has seen for himself how a narrative that belongs to a different era has captured the imagination of football followers everywhere. \u201cWe get letters through from all parts of the world \u2013 Vietnam, China, America, Scotland. They\u2019re all pretty much on the same lines, that they\u2019re over the moon at what we\u2019re doing this season and congratulating us on what we\u2019ve achieved,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery neutral, and just people in general, want Leicester to do well. I know fans of Arsenal and Manchester City who have said to me: \u2018We\u2019d love you to go on and win the title or to get into the top four\u2019. It just goes to show not only that we\u2019re doing well and upsetting the rhythm of the Premier League but they can see what a good club it is. If it wasn\u2019t people wouldn\u2019t want you to do well.\u201d Bottom of the table this time last year, Leicester have already won the battle for hearts and minds in an extraordinary title race. Claudio Ranieri\u2019s side travel to second-placed Manchester City on Saturday and \u2013 let this soak in for a moment \u2013 would go a minimum of five points clear with 13 games remaining if they can following up Tuesday\u2019s win over Liverpool with another victory. Not that anyone at Leicester is getting carried away. Ranieri has already ruled out adopting Barack Obama\u2019s \u2018Yes we can\u2019 slogan from the US president\u2019s 2008 campaign and Leicester\u2019s players are too busy trying to make sense of everything to be swept along with the hype. \u201cWe stay grounded because, to be honest, we\u2019re as shocked as everybody else to be in this situation,\u201d Albrighton says. \u201cWe knew we had a great side and we knew we could do something special, but not in our wildest dreams could we have thought we\u2019d be in this position at this stage of the season. Our target was just staying in the league.\u201d With their aggressive pressing, incredible work ethic and ability to counterattack with such pace, Leicester have struck upon a winning formula. Albrighton talks about learning from their Boxing Day defeat at Anfield, where they were uncharacteristically passive, and how on Tuesday against the same opponents they \u201ccame out all guns blazing from the first whistle, got in their face and showed them no respect\u201d. Released by Aston Villa 21 months ago \u2013 a blessing in disguise if ever there was one \u2013 Albrighton sounds like he is relishing his new lease of life in the east midlands. After making such a positive impact at the end of last term, he has started all but one of Leicester\u2019s league games this season and is one of several unsung heroes in a team where \u201cnobody takes themselves too seriously\u201d. The dressing room, he says, is not short of characters. Jamie Vardy is the life and soul of the party, according to the former Villa winger, with Kasper Schmeichel not far behind. The comedy value is provided by Robert Huth\u2019s dry sense of humour while N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, who has been such a revelation this season, is a picture of happiness. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen NG when he hasn\u2019t been smiling, no matter what. He could be late for a meeting or late to training and someone will say: \u2018You\u2019re fined \u00a3200\u2019, and he will just have a massive grin across his face,\u201d Albrighton says, laughing. \u201cOn the pitch he runs through everything and tackles. He has been tremendous for us.\u201d Alongside Vardy and Riyad Mahrez, Kant\u00e9 is arguably one of three outstanding individuals in the Leicester team that will start at the Etihad and has been put together at a total cost of about \u00a321m. Or, to put it another way, half as much as City paid for Eliaquim Mangala. Although Albrighton suspects some of Leicester\u2019s players \u201cwouldn\u2019t fit in at a Man City because it\u2019s a different style of play\u201d, he has no doubt that at least two of his team-mates could get a game for one of the elite clubs. \u201cVardy and Riyad would walk into any other team. How they haven\u2019t got a player like Vardy, who will run in behind and stretch a defence, is beyond me, because it\u2019s one of the best weapons you can have in a team. And you\u2019ve got Mahrez, who can do anything on his day.\u201d As for Albrighton, the 26-year-old admits he is a different player to the one that broke through and showed such promise at Villa under G\u00e9rard Houllier back in the 2010-11 season. \u201cI\u2019ve had to adapt my game a little bit. With my injuries as well, I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019ve lost a bit of pace, I\u2019m not as confident to run past a player any more, whereas I\u2019m more confident in my crossing ability. I feel like I\u2019ve worked on that more since I burst on the scene.\u201d Villa\u2019s disastrous position gives him no pleasure. Born in Tamworth, Albrighton grew up supporting the club that is anchored to the foot of the table \u2013 he went to watch them in the FA Cup semi-final last season \u2013 and it seems strange to think he could be running out to the sound of the Champions League anthem at a time when Villa are playing in the Championship. \u201cMy first hope is that we can do something big, but then I hope that something can get sorted at Villa Park,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right that a club as big as that could be playing in the Championship. It just goes to show that you are never too big to go down and a bit of arrogance has probably cost them in the end.\u201d Albrighton remembers what it was like for Leicester when they were marooned at the bottom last season and says that the pressure of being in a relegation battle, when \u201ceverything was riding on it\u201d, is so much greater than anything they are experiencing at the top of the table. At the same time, Albrighton fully appreciates this is once-in-a-lifetime territory for Leicester and that they have to seize their chance. \u201cThe manager has told us that we need to enjoy the moment but make sure that we don\u2019t waste what we\u2019re doing because next year will be totally different,\u201d Albrighton says. \u201cChelsea, Manchester United, even Liverpool, they\u2019ll be back up to the standards they set previously, so it\u2019s going to be a lot harder, so we might not get this position again. We need to take advantage of it now.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
