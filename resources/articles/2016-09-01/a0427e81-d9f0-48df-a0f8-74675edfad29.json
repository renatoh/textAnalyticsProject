In the build-up to the club\u2019s first competitive outing on Scottish soil he was at it again. \u201cFootball is a process and my happiness is to see the team getting better. Maybe small steps but getting better. That is what I want,\u201d Guardiola said this week. So as City strove for the \u201clittle record\u201d of matching Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s 11 victories on the bounce, which initiated their 1960-61 Double-winning campaign, the search was on for the small steps demanded by the uber-perfectionist head coach. What he saw unfold at Celtic Park was a dogfight that was the sternest test yet of his City project and which should allow it to grow as Guardiola desires. The Catalan was allowed only three minutes before dismay may have swept through him. This was the time required for Brendan Rodgers\u2019s team to take the lead through Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and become the first opposition to open the scoring against Guardiola\u2019s men since he took over. It rocked City and proved the highlight of a Celtic onslaught that lasted 10 minutes as Kolo Tour\u00e9 nearly doubled the lead and the home crowd were at fever pitch. And it proved the first phase of a night-long examination of City\u2019s backbone. Guardiola had spoken of how defeat or its prospect is bound to come at some point and how his team responds will be vital. He wants City to possess the \u201cstability\u201d to deal with reverses and show the kind of unshakeable character that he would like to foster in his squad. Eight minutes were required to give Guardiola a clue to all of this. Seven were spent weathering the early storm. The other two involved City mounting a first attack \u2013 David Silva went through but could not finish \u2013 and then securing an equaliser from Fernandinho. Maybe City would now be rampant and coast through this second Group C match. It seemed the obvious corollary of the way Guardiola\u2019s men have previously cuffed away any opponent who dared to offer resistance. Celtic, though, had the temerity to buck this pattern by again pulling into the lead and again rocking City. This time Raheem Sterling was admirable in popping up at right-back near Claudio Bravo\u2019s goal and unlucky to turn the ball past his own keeper. City were embroiled in a genuine tear-up and there were clues all over the Celtic Park turf. An illustration came when the classy Ilkay G\u00fcndogan presented a collector\u2019s item by making the wrong choice near Craig Gordon\u2019s area and ceded possession. Another was in the way Fernandinho and Aleksandar Kolarov \u2013 two standout performers thus far for Guardiola \u2013 endured some shaky and difficult moments. If City have been a team in which each and every player has improved markedly in the Catalan\u2019s school, Sterling has a case for being Guardiola\u2019s star pupil. In the 3-1 win at Swansea on Saturday he netted a sublime goal via mesmeric footwork. It involved, too, the composure he is supposed to lack. To score City\u2019s second equaliser Sterling produced a near carbon copy of Fred Astaire footwork and cold-eyed calm as he finished past Gordon eight minutes after his own goal. The high-octane entertainment the fans were being served up hardly slackened after the break, as Kolarov\u2019s night plunged into mini-nightmare territory with the error that allowed Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 to hook in his second goal of the night This surely wrecked any interval words Guardiola offered his charges as it came only just over a minute into the second half. It meant the 11 men sent out by the coach were dealing with an uncomfortable and totally foreign in-game scenario: the very real prospect of a defeat against an outfit whose last outing in the Champions League had been the 7-0 hiding given them at the Camp Nou by Barcelona. City\u2019s response was to take less than 10 minutes to draw level again as Nolito provided a third equaliser of what had proved a pulsating game. Before the match Rodgers had said: \u201cIt\u2019s a great challenge of us. We\u2019re really looking forward to the game.\u201d Celtic played like they did and enjoyed a result deserving of their willingness to take the scrap to City\u2019s gilded talents. They actually did more: they made the game a scrap. And in doing so the Scottish side found a way of disrupting the smooth and ruthless killing machine that had vanquished its 10 previous foes. City\u2019s rivals may take note of this match. They may strive to emulate the number Celtic managed to do on them. But they should also be wary of how Guardiola\u2019s side went toe-to-toe with Celtic and refused to be downed. And, how, in Guardiola, City have a coach who is sure to plot how best to avoid this occurring again."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
