In a move designed to boost transparency, the company said the research and asset management division, which serves research analysts and portfolio managers, made an operating loss of some \u00a37m last year. By contrast, its biggest division - sales and trading, which sells news and trading platforms to brokers - made an underlying operating profit of \u00a3260m with an operating margin of 17%. This unit accounts for about two-thirds of Reuters' revenue and more than three-quarters of its profit. Its enterprise unit, which sells data feeds and other products to companies, posted an operating profit of \u00a363m with a margin of 16%. The media unit, the smallest of its four divisions, which sells text and photographs to other news organisations such as the Guardian, made an operating profit of \u00a316m and a margin of 11%. Reuters is soon to move out of its historic Fleet Street headquarters to a new, purpose-built office in London's Canary Wharf. Although Reuters journalists stopped working on the \"Street of Shame\" some time ago, the company is to hold a remembrance service in the journalists' church, St Bride's, later this month. Rupert Murdoch, the owner of the Times and Sun newspapers, who probably did more than anyone to change Fleet Street when he moved his titles into Wapping, will read a lesson. Baroness de Reuter, widow of the last Baron and one of the last remaining members of Baron Julius Reuter's family, will also attend. Reuters revealed the figures at an analysts' presentation to launch a new accounting tool. Its next set of results, due in July, will also provide a divisional breakdown made before any charges for restructuring or amortisation. Analysts welcomed the disclosure, which was in contrast with information made available from Reuters' chief rival, privately owned Bloomberg. Shares in the company rose 1% to 390.75p."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
