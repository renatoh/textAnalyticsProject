The analysis of over 100,000 insurance claims carried out by fleet management company Arval PHH shows that the biggest cause of insurance claims, at 14%, result from damage while a car is parked. However, while television adverts continue to warn of the dangers of theft from cars, this only accounts for 5% of insurance claims, according to Arval PHH. Third parties cutting across drivers' paths account for over 12%, while other drivers hitting the rear of the car are blamed for 10.25% of claims. \"This demonstrates that many drivers disregard safe distances and drive too close to the car in front,\" said Mike Breeze, director of accident management at Arval PHH. \"The high percentage of claims caused by the driver reversing or manoeuvring suggests that a lot of drivers are taking insufficient care in what should be a one of the most basic elements of driving.\" The company said that persistent parking close to the corners of roads was a possible reason for so many vehicles being struck while parked. A recent AA survey named Wythenshawe near Manchester, Prestwich and Middleton as the most expensive places in the country to insure a car, while residents of the Isle of Man enjoy lower car insurance premiums than anywhere in Britain."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
