But you don't have to believe in the factual basis of a tradition to use it artistically. The great art of the Renaissance, for instance, used classical mythology for source material, as well as the Bible. jonecc When did Dawkins ever claim that he wanted to prevent any and all possible reference to religion in art? He actually talks explicitly about the cultural and artistic importance of the Bible. BobChurchill Secular artists will continue to be inspired by Christian tradition, just as Renaissance artists were inspired by ancient Rome. You can admire the design aesthetic of Soviet propaganda posters without buying into their Stalinist philosophy. trebor1969 You seem to ignore the facts. Just as religion has inspired great art, it has also inspired war, terror, pain and suffering, and still does - does artistic inspiration outweigh this? iMac The interesting point that I think Mark is trying to get across is that much great art stems from a reaction to faith issues, and is better off for this. Anyone who has read Sarah Kane's play Blasted can see that it is far removed from the world of the Church, yet it deals with aspects of humanity that can only stem from a consideration of the soul. magnemar How has Christianity helped people ask moral and philosophical questions? It teaches people not to question; it sets out a set of moral and philosophical laws, and demands that they are not questioned. ReasonableTrubble Religion has been directly responsible for enormous amounts of censorship and destruction of art. Perhaps, without the constraints of Christianity, our artistic treasures could be even more varied and profound. necroflangerie If you want to paint crucifixions and virgins, I don't think Dawkins or anyone else is going to stop you. No one is going to enjoy or appreciate that kind of religious art, though. Like it or not, this is the 21st century. faustroll The Sistine Chapel is rubbish anyway.
