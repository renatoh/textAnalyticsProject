David Robinson Simon, a Californian attorney and author, has argued that meat and dairy producers in the US and, increasingly, Australia, are teaming with governments to encourage people to consume more animal products than they otherwise would. In his book Meatonomics, he laid out the part played by subsidies, legislation and regulation in the provision of meat, eggs and dairy at the prices and in the quantities that consumers had become accustomed to. \u201cThis triple whammy of messaging, legislation and price control ... deprives consumers of the ability to make informed and independent decisions of what and how much to eat,\u201d he said in a guest lecture organised by the the not-for-profit Voiceless animal protection institute at the University of Sydney on Thursday night. Australian producers were implementing many of the same strategies, he said, pointing to the \u201caggressive messaging\u201d of industry bodies such as Meat and Livestock Australia, funded by a levy collected from livestock producers on the sale of stock by the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources. In the US, a similar \u201ccheckoff\u201d was imposed on cattle imports and sales to fund promotion and marketing of beef and beef products. \u201cBoth in the US and Australia, our federal governments are engaged in a campaign to support industry and bombard us with messages to get us to consume more meat, eggs and dairy,\u201d Simon said. \u201cWe can say without controversy or doubt that when a checkoff program speaks in the US \u2013 when it says drink more milk, eat more beef \u2013 that is the federal government of our country telling consumers to eat more animal foods.\u201d He said the same forces were at work in Australia, where industry had influence over standard-setting, and legislation decriminalised abuse of factory-raised animals and insulated the producers from scrutiny and liability. A spokesman for MLA said that it was a producer-owned, not-for-profit organisation that delivered marketing activities on behalf of the Australian red meat industry, \u201cultimately delivering improved profitability to those farmers\u201d. MLA used producer levies to fund research and development \u201cto ensure we improve productivity\u201d across the whole value chain \u2013 from farm through processing to retail, he said. The legal counsel for Voiceless, Sarah Margo, said every federal animal welfare initiative had been dismantled by the Abbott government. It had withdrawn funding for the Australian animal welfare strategy, disbanded its advisory committee and dissolved an animal welfare subdivision within the Department of Agriculture. Plans for an independent inspector-general of animal welfare and live export had been abandoned, along with those for the improved animal welfare program in 2013. Margo said the Australian framework to protect animal welfare was failing under the management of Department of Agriculture, which was also tasked with maximising output. Of the 15 research and development corporations through which the Australian government and primary producers co-funded research \u201cfor industry and community benefits\u201d, 10 were industry-owned companies, including Meat and Livestock Australia. This effectively meant research \u201cwas prepared by industry, for industry, with the use of industry-funded science\u201d, Margo said. The MLA spokesman said much of the research it funded was focused on improving animal welfare across the industry, as well as productivity. A spokeswoman for the Department of Agriculture said the government did not fund marketing. This, said Simon, was a \u201cred herring\u201d since the government did fund research and development: \u201ca distinction that strikes me as relatively academic.\u201d But Margo said there was cause to be optimistic when the Productivity Commission had recognised this perceived \u201cconflict of interest ... [and] disproportionate industry influence\u201d in its recent inquiry into regulation of Australian agriculture. In a report sent to government in November 2016 and made public in March, the commission recommended that an independent body, the Australian Commission for Animal Welfare, be established to manage the development of farm animal regulation. According to current OECD figures, the average Australian eats about 93kg of meat each year \u2013 three times the global average. This came with a cost, said Simon, noting Australia\u2019s high cancer rates. The World Health Organisation\u2019s IARC cancer research organisation had classified processed beef a group-one carcinogen. \u201cThat\u2019s in the same category as asbestos,\u201d he said. In April last year, Meat and Livestock Australia reported that its You\u2019re Better on Beef campaign had succeeding in reducing the number of \u201cmothers limiting red meat consumption due to health concerns ... by 20% to only 23%\u201d. But those health concerns were justified, Simon said. \u201cOne must ask the question: is it appropriate for the government to be pushing meat when it\u2019s certainly not telling people expose yourself to asbestos, coal fibre or other carcinogens? \u201cI\u2019ll have to leave that as a rhetorical question. I think the answer is obvious. If you feel a sense of outrage, I suggest you talk to your MP.\u201d The MLA spokesman said the MLA strongly promoted eating red meat as part of a balanced diet, consistent with dietary guidelines developed by the National Health and Medical Research Council, a standalone government agency. He also disputed the IARC classification of processed meat. Simon proposes not only eliminating government subsidies on animal food products, but introducing a tax on them to reduce consumption and restore a \u201cstate of equilibrium to the market\u201d. He said there was growing support for such a measure, \u201cfor the social reasons we saw with tobacco and other undesirables\u201d, and that he expected the medical profession in a \u201csmaller, more progressive\u201d jurisdiction such as Denmark, Sweden or California to take the lead. After appearances in Perth, Adelaide and Sydney, Simon is due to speak in Hobart, Melbourne, Brisbane and Canberra next week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
