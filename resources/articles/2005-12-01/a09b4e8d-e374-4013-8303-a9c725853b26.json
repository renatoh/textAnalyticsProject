He will face Joe Perry, a 9-8 winner over Stuart Bingham. Ding's 9-5 defeat of Stephen Hendry in the China Open final last March in front of 2,000 spectators and 100 million television viewers showed he can handle bigger occasions, though a couple of surprise defeats in qualifying competitions in front of the proverbial man and a dog have suggested he needs a vibrant atmosphere to produce his best. The draw fell well for him here. Finding Jimmy White desperately out of sorts, he led him 8-0 and beat him 9-3; Paul Hunter, worried and physically weakened by intensive chemotherapy for cancer, was dispatched 9-2. Ding's defeat of Robertson reversed the result of their 2003 world under-21 championship semi-final, Ding scoring the more heavily with 77, 102, 65, 79 and a valedictory 92 his chief contributions, the key phase of the match proving to be his progression from 4-3 to 7-3. Perry, who like Robertson practices at Cambridge Snooker Centre on a table with television lighting for his exclusive use, left York a year ago bitterly disappointed. Leading David Gray 8-7 with his opponent needing a snooker, he contrived to lose their semi-final 9-8, a reverse which unsettled him for months. Bingham, who won the 1996 world amateur title in Invercargill, and was runner-up in Bulawayo the following year, has only this season harnessed his considerable talent consistently. He has had his moments, including an opening-day victory over Hendry at the Crucible in 2000 when he also came within pink and black of a \u00a3167,000 bonus for a maximum. Unfortunately, his two 147s have been in events offering no bonus prize but he awoke yesterday with 17 wins from his 18 matches this season, a sequence which included the defeat of Shaun Murphy, the world champion, to reach the Grand Prix quarter-finals in October, winning the qualifying competition for the Masters and a 9-3 win in York over Matthew Stevens, the 2003 UK champion. His quarter-final was nip and tuck all the way. Bingham looked as if he might reach the first world-ranking semi-final of his career when he led 8-7 but Perry coolly levelled with a break of 100, and with an immaculate display of safety play, shut Bingham out of the 30-minute decider. Today's other semi-final pits the resurgent Steve Davis, who won the last of his six UK titles in 1987, and Hendry, who won the last of his five in 1996."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
