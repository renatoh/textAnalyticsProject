OK, so you Twitter", "bodyText": "David Prager, chief operating officer of Revision3, found a strange man in his home last night, just before 4am. Did he call the cops? No, he went on to Twitter: ok, maybe I should lock my door - I swear a random dude just walked into my bathroom and I can't believe I haven't freaked out This isn't, fortunately, an armed robbery. Prager thinks the man is drunk and/or a hobo: \"my gut tells me he's harmless,\" he tweets. Later he decides to stream video to ustream from his laptop so everyone can watch. The video shows Prager trying to get the guy out of his bed and out of the door, which he manages to do. \"This is a little ridiculous, and I should be freaking out,\" says Prager, \"and I'm being way too nice, and I totally understand -- I'm not reading the chat right now -- but this is a little crazy. I think he's a little drunk and messed up.\" Prager, at least, doesn't seem too disturbed by the incident. \"Maybe I take comfort from the fact that I can share it with a few people,\" he says. \"Makes it a little easier.\" Prager's twitstream rapidly returned to normal, but the story was picked up by Late Night With Jimmy Fallon and Silicon Alley Insider. Be interesting to see if anyone can identify the \"hobo\" from the video. That might give it some depth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
