Monkey's man in a sharp suit reports her quip to a seminar for City types last week: \"At least your executives don't report to you with white powder coming out of their noses.\" And on the notoriously disloyal BBC: \"If you think your organisation is leaky, you should see what I have to put up with from my so-called colleagues.\" Time for a lie down, Lorraine? \u00b7 At Radio 4, the seemingly simple tasks of (a) broadcasting a tape, and (b) not broadcasting something else at the same time are becoming problematic. In the past month, Iain Duncan Smith's voice has broken into The Archers and a woman murmuring \"irritable bowel syndrome\" (from the medical programme due on air next) has interrupted chatting rural strollers in Open Country. Worst of all, the first instalment of the incessantly promoted Sunday classic serial, Flashman at the Charge, had to be humiliatingly abandoned after 20 minutes due to \"technical problems\". As BBC folk say in times of crisis, assistant heads will roll. \u00b7 That the debut verse collection by Felix Dennis, Maxim's ex-hippie publisher, includes an offering devoted to the penis is no great surprise. More disconcerting in A Glass Half Full is a bold attack on desexualising the elderly: \"When you're next with your grandma,/Try closing half an eye,/Smooth out the wrinkled creases,/Add lipstick on the sly,/Imagine fiery tresses,/ Imagine there's no dress!\" And he was doing so well until that last line. \u00b7 Last week's announcement that on-leave Scotland on Sunday editor Margot Wilson will not be returning to retrieve her job from John McLellan means an era has come to end: with Rebecca Hardy and Sue Douglas already departed, all the English blondes imported by Andrew Neil for his Scottish titles have now been repatriated. The Sloaney, mane-tossing, Wilson caused Scots staff particular amusement, earning the memorable nickname 'My Little Pony'. \u00b7 For a man who spends so much time in France, Neil did well to find no fewer than six British press and broadcasting topics to fulminate about in his debut media column for Associated's London Evening Standard last Wednesday. Curiously, though, the buying-up of Alex Ferguson's accuser by the Standard's sister-title, the Mail on Sunday, was not among them, although it was manifestly the hottest newspaper issue of the preceding days. If you can't write about three papers because you run them, and another three because that group has hired you, are you ideally equipped to be a media commentator?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
