Ashley Giles's persistent bowling wide of leg-stump rendered Sachin Tendulkar strokeless for long periods and caused a heated debate about the legitimacy of the tactics. Now Sunil Gavaskar, one of England's most trenchant critics and chairman of the International Cricket Council's cricket committee (playing), has overseen a small but significant change to the standard playing conditions, enabling umpires to intervene in the case of negative tactics. India had intended to demand additional fielding restrictions in Test cricket to outlaw Giles's line of attack, in which the left-arm spinner bowled over the wicket, into the footmarks a foot outside Tendulkar's leg-stump. But that plan was withdrawn and the cricket committee proposed in its place a rewording of the conditions relating to the law on wides, removing reference to the ball \"going wider\". Umpires previously reluctant to \"wide\" Giles for persistently negative bowling because of the line of his attack should feel more at liberty to intervene. Gavaskar insisted: \"This change will give the umpires the power they felt they needed.\" But, although the change itself is a fair one, Gavaskar's conflict of interests might seem disturbing. It was the former Indian opening batsman who said in his column in the Hindustan Times: \"Without the slightest doubt England are the most unattractive and boring side to have played cricket in India.\" That criticism brought an official complaint from England about Gavaskar's role with the ICC. Now Gavaskar has won the day and he may be looking forward to England's next Test visit in 2006 a little more enthusiastically. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
