Usually 1,600 lifeguards keep watch at 248 beaches around the UK and the Channel Islands but the charity is drawing up plans to cover about 70 of its usual spots in high summer if government guidance allows. RNLI planners are ploughing through data to pinpoint factors such as the busiest beaches and those where they have carried out the most rescues to work out which ones to patrol. They will also try to get an even spread of beaches around the UK to discourage a rush towards one well-guarded region. Earlier in the Covid-19 crisis, the RNLI warned it would be very difficult to suddenly ramp up its service because not enough lifeguards would have been trained. But it is planning to try to get around this by using experienced lifeguards who can be trained quickly, rather than taking on new ones. RNLI chief executive, Mark Dowie, said: \u201cThe RNLI is incredibly proud of its highly skilled lifeguards who work alongside the lifeboat crews, HM Coastguard and other emergency services. \u201cRNLI lifeguards are professional lifesavers and will be essential when the lockdown is lifted and people head to our coastlines and enjoy our beaches. \u201cThe current situation means that the operational logistics and training behind setting up a lifeguard service \u2013 normally in full swing at the moment \u2013 have had to stop. \u201cRe-establishing this infrastructure and distributing equipment to beaches will take time. And we must also make sure that conditions are safe for our lifeguards to provide an effective service \u2013 our priority remains the safety of our people and the public. \u201cBut despite these challenges, and given enough notice of lockdown lifting, we\u2019re hoping to put lifeguard patrols on around 70 beaches. \u201cWe are planning for a service that we can adapt to changes in government guidelines and restrictions. We don\u2019t know what social distancing restrictions will be in place, or whether we\u2019ll have periods where restrictions are relaxed and then reintroduced.\u201d About 35% of RNLI staff have been furloughed. The charity has suspended the building of boats and work on lifeboat stations but its 238 bases remain operational and have been launching during the lockdown. The RNLI is urging everyone to follow government guidance and recommends that the permitted daily exercise is not on or in the sea."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
