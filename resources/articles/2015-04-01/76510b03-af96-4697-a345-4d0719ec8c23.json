Pearson, who has not had much to talk about of late in terms of results, grinned wryly. \u201cOh come on Sam, I haven\u2019t won for donkeys!\u201d Allardyce, whose West Ham team had played their full part in a remarkably open game, grinned back, and the two men disappeared for a snifter. The West Ham manager gave every indication he had rather enjoyed the game if not the result and, perhaps as a way of making a point to both the club\u2019s owners and supporters, said he intended to continue to go forward for the rest of the season. \u201cThe big shout at the start of the season was that we had to attack more and we\u2019ve done that in the entire season,\u201d Allardyce said. \u201cWe\u2019ve lacked a few more clean sheets than we wanted, which would\u2019ve given us more victories and draws and got us higher up the table. \u201cBut we\u2019ve scored more goals than we ever have, and our aim is to push on for the next seven games and make sure we get more than 46 points, which is our best total, and if we can do that by playing as we are we\u2019ll carry on.\u201d For different reasons Pearson too, so cautious in the first half of the season when he often played only one up front, now has little choice other than to have a go, and his 4-4-2 formation transformed itself to 4-2-4 at every opportunity. The result was a wild and entertaining free-for-all that could easily have finished 5-4 to either team. As it was, Esteban Cambiasso\u2019s early volley was cancelled out by Cheikhou Kouyat\u00e9\u2019s angled finish in the first half, before the substitute Andy King won the game five minutes from time by prodding home Jamie Vardy\u2019s scuffed effort from close range. The crowd, which had also seen David Nugent\u2019s penalty saved by Adri\u00e1n and Kouyat\u00e9 hit the inside of the post, and any number of near misses, exploded in relief. With eight games to go, the odds are still against Leicester pulling themselves out of trouble but they have West Bromwich, Burnley, Sunderland and, in the final game of the season, Queens Park Rangers still to play. According to Pearson, their fate remains in their own hands. The frustrating thing, he said, is that Leicester have playing well for quite some time, without getting results. \u201cI would love to be a lucky manager who plays crap and wins but we\u2019ve not been that, and that I think is because the level and the technical ability of sides you play in the Premier League doesn\u2019t allow you to do that too often. \u201cI\u2019m sure everybody has a viewpoint on who are the best, worst and indifferent sides we have still to play but the reality is it doesn\u2019t pan out like that because every side at this level has a few individuals who are exceptionally good. That\u2019s the biggest challenge.\u201d The fact five of Leicester\u2019s last eight games are at home could be key according to King, who has spent all eight years of his career to date at City, and whose goal was his 50th for the club. \u201cWe take heart from the way we\u2019ve been playing and the performances we\u2019ve put in, and it\u2019s a result that proves 100% we can survive,\u201d he said. \u201cIt proves to everyone \u2013 not just ourselves \u2013 that we mean business.\u201d Man of the match Esteban Cambiasso (Leicester City)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
