As Ashley Giles's wrist was cracked by a Harmison ball in the nets, so Dawson was thrust into the front line of the England attack for the second Test in Adelaide starting tomorrow. It will be his first international appearance since last December. So far on the tour Dawson has been restricted to playing two warm-up matches and it seemed his role was to keep his fellow fringe player, the wicketkeeper James Foster from getting bored. The only realistic chance of him adding to his Test experience looked to be the final match in Sydney, where two spinners are almost mandatory. Thanks to Harmison that has all changed and Dawson now has the opportunity to live up to the Yorkshire coach Wayne Clark's assessment that he possesses the tenacity of a future England captain. \"When I first saw him play I said he would one day play for England,\" Clark said. \"My next prediction is that one day he will captain England. It's a big statement but he is a big thinker. He is intelligent, aggressive and has an ability to gain respect from the players.\" Clark promoted Dawson from the Yorkshire second team at the start of the championship-winning season of 2001 and later that year described him as being \"a player with a bit of shit about him\". That strength was exhibited when Dawson made his Test debut in India after playing only 11 first-class matches and recovered from having catches dropped off his bowling in Mohali to take four wickets during India's first innings. Though he took only two further wickets in the series, his flight and control earned him the admiration of the England management and his phlegmatic manner made him a popular figure on an arduous tour. Tougher times lay ahead, though, with Dawson, a sports science graduate, displaced in the side for the trip to New Zealand before being afflicted with second-season syndrome. As his county nose-dived towards relegation Dawson was left out of the side but returned to finish with 39 wickets and earn a place on the plane to Australia. \"He battles well and seems to be getting things back,\" Clark said. \"He is still only 22 with plenty to learn. He had a tough season but it will do him good to struggle and work hard because things happened to fall for him during his first season.\" The England captain Nasser Hussain has spotted a similar inner resolve in Dawson and admitted he \"has got a lot of character\" before the net practice that ended in Giles's trip to casualty, though that character can sometimes lead to an over-aggressive approach. \"I always set out to attack but at times I've over- attacked,\" Dawson said. \"One thing Clark has taught me is the need to go for fewer runs. Sometimes you just need to tighten up rather than try to take a wicket with every ball. It's all about building pressure and sometimes I've been guilty of trying too many things.\" During the first Test in Brisbane Giles took six wickets and spoke disarmingly of the difficulty in trying to compare himself to Shane Warne; it is a steadfastness Dawson will doubtless attempt to copy. As the owner of three initials, a university degree and four A-levels Dawson was a prime candidate to be nicknamed \"the professor\" when he first entered the Yorkshire dressing room but, while insisting that \"people think I've got more brains than I have\", he has become a popular figure among his Headingley colleagues. His standing in the England party could be given a similar fillip if he manages to extract the turn usually offered by the Adelaide Oval pitch after a few days of heavy wear and tear, which Warne has found in the past. As an off-spinner Dawson will pose a few more problems to the four left-handers in the Australian top seven and, if he can find the right blend of attack and consistency in Adelaide, then he could make Clark a very proud coach."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
