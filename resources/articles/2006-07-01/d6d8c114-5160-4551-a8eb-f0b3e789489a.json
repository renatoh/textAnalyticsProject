On Saturday morning, my synagogue welcomed a group of Muslims from all over London to our Sabbath morning service. It was a response to the hospitality extended to me by a Muslim community on the occasion of the birthday of Muhammed some months ago. In listening to one another speak, question, argue and pray, we recognised that Muslims and Jews share more than divides them: a belief in one god, a profound attachment to our respective religious-cultural identities, and a wealth of inherited traditions and institutions. Judaism does not preach hatred. And if Keenan were not so caught up in the world's confusion about the significance of the Jewish narrative, he would listen to those voices within Israel itself calling for an end to the war and to the hurt and destruction inflicted on both the Lebanese population and Israelis - Jewish Israelis and Palestinian Arab Israelis - who are all caught up in this wretched conflict. Alexandra Wright Senior rabbi, Liberal Jewish Synagogue, St John's Wood, London In the midst of the third world war psychosis being whipped up over Lebanon by the American right, I cannot help recalling those pictures a year ago of the suicide bombers at King's Cross station looking so serene and happy, without a care in the world - the world from which they were about to depart. Ever since a doubt has nagged my mind that the description \"terrorist\" may not do them justice. For the expression on their faces was not in the least diabolical, but rather innocent and happy, confident they were about God's business. No, I am not gratuitously seeking to excuse or justify their actions, but to encourage a true evaluation of the kind of enemy we are about to fight a third world war against: not so much monsters bent on evil, as religious fanatics bent on good. Tragically, in the feverish mobilisation of opinion which a war psychosis requires, the possibility that freedom and democracy are not the only uplifting causes for which good men can be inspired to kill and die tends to get overlooked. What the west is in danger of doing, I fear, is to exaggerate grotesquely the physical challenge of terrorism - so as to whip up a war psychosis - and greatly to minimise the spiritual challenge. For God may not be on the side of freedom and democracy as much as Senator Gingrich, glibly assuming a third world war - a truly evil thing to do - likes to assume. Peregrine Worsthorne Hedgerley, Buckinghamshire Kim Howells rightly says (Report, July 24) the Israelis \"have got to think very hard about those children who are dying\". Presumably, he's given the same message to Hizbullah and its Iranian and Syrian backers? Brian Hoffmann London"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
