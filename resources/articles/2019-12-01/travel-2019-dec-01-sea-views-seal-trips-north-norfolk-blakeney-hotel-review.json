On the north Norfolk coast, overlooking the salt marshes and mud banks between Wells-Next-The-Sea and Cromer. The Blakeney is a stylish, 60-room grand hotel with an award-winning restaurant and a bounty of home comforts. What\u2019s new about the place? All rooms are individually designed and cosy. The restaurant\u2019s daily changing menu reflects the freshness of the day\u2019s catch, and the hotel\u2019s attention to detail. There\u2019s also a decent-size pool and mini gym, if you\u2019re so inclined. Star attractions? Blakeney Point\u2019s grey and common seal colonies are the local heroes and a boat trip from Blakeney or Morston Quay for a peek at them, in their hundreds, is a must-see. Beans Boats\u2019 wisecracking crew have been taking tours around the Blakeney nature reserve for years and there can\u2019t be much they don\u2019t know about the seals and migrating birds. Drive west to Holkham Bay to stroll along the dunes and miles of stunning beach. Room with a view? Yes, definitely! The Lookout on the first floor is a large room with a panoramic window looking out over the estuary, complete with a telescope and binoculars. It\u2019s a wonderful setting in which to watch the wildlife while enjoying an afternoon tea. Where\u2019s good to eat? Try the Moorings in Blakeney High Street, for lunch, tea or supper. And don\u2019t forget to visit\u2026 Sandringham is only a half-hour drive away, and in winter the town of Holt, a few miles to the south, is lit up with magical street lights.
