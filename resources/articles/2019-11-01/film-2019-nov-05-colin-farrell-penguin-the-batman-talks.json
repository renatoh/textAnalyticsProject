According to Deadline, the actor could be returning to the comic book world for the first time since his role as Bullseye in 2003\u2019s Daredevil. In the new interpretation, called The Batman, Pattinson will play the Caped Crusader as a detective in a neo-noir take on the character. \u201cHis morality is a little bit off. He\u2019s not the golden boy, unlike almost every other comic-book character,\u201d Pattinson said about the character to the New York Times. \u201cThere is a simplicity to his worldview, but where it sits is strange, which allows you to have more scope with the character.\u201d The Cloverfield director Matt Reeves is behind the project which has also recently secured Paul Dano as the Riddler, Zoe Kravitz as Catwoman and Jeffrey Wright as Commissioner Gordon. Today it was also revealed that Andy Serkis is in talks to play Alfred Pennyworth, Bruce Wayne\u2019s butler previously brought to the screen by Michael Caine in Christopher Nolan\u2019s Dark Knight trilogy. \u201cWhat\u2019s exciting about Batman is how it relates to now and also how personal it can be,\u201d Reeves told the Hollywood Reporter earlier this year. \u201cIt\u2019s very much a point-of-view-driven, noir Batman tale. It\u2019s told very squarely on his shoulders, and I hope it\u2019s going to be a story that will be thrilling but also emotional.\u201d Farrell was last seen in Disney\u2019s live-action Dumbo and next year he stars alongside Matthew McConaughey in Guy Ritchie\u2019s The Gentlemen and sci-fi drama After Yang. Production on The Batman is set to start late this year or early 2020 with a 2021 release date. Next year also sees the release of the sequel Wonder Woman 1984, as well as Birds of Prey, starring Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
