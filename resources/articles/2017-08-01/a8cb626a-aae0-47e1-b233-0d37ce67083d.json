Dame Stephanie Shirley, whose company was one of the first to sell software in the 1960s, said that engaging very young children \u2013 in particular girls \u2013 could ignite a passion for puzzles and problem-solving long before the \u201cmale geek\u201d stereotype took hold. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can start too early,\u201d she said, adding that evidence suggested that the best time to introduce children to simple coding activities was between the ages of two and seven years. \u201cMost successful later coders start between five and six,\u201d she added. \u201cIn a sense, those years are the best for learning anything \u2026 and means that programming [hasn\u2019t] become set in your mind as geeky or nerdy.\u201d Shirley\u2019s comments came as A-level results last week revealed a striking gender divide in computing, with only 9.8% of those taking the subject at A-level being girls. Shirley also called on tech companies, such as Google and Facebook, to introduce anonymous recruitment to help address the lack of female programmers. Only 20% of Google engineers are female (the statistic is roughly matched across the industry) and one recent report showed male founders are nearly twice as likely to attract venture capital funding. \u201cOnce you have an imbalance, the leaders of today define the leaders of tomorrow,\u201d said Shirley. \u201cIt\u2019s instinctive to recruit in your own image. I think some of this will continue until we actually learn to anonymise some of our relationships and computers help in that.\u201d Programmers, she argued, should be assessed on skill, just as secretaries were once given typing tests. \u201cYou don\u2019t send a photo, you don\u2019t give a name, you just look at the achievements of the person as a selection process,\u201d she said. She describes the recent internal memo by a former Google engineer as \u201cso patronising\u201d and \u201cutterly unacceptable\u201d and added that a failure to tackle the gender gap had led to \u201cvery macho\u201d cultures in some tech companies, from which women felt excluded. Shirley contrasts this with the ethos at her first company, Freelance Programmers, which in the 1960s was among the first to sell technical software packages. Out of the first 300 staff, she employed just three male programmers and the gender ratio only shifted significantly when the Sex Discrimination Act passed in 1975. \u201cYou\u2019d think I\u2019d be as happy as anything because I\u2019m a bit of a feminist, but that really meant that my woman\u2019s company had to let the men in,\u201d she said. Shirley has previously spoken out about the sexism she faced in her early days working in computing and she later adopted the nickname Steve professionally because she found it easier to win contracts when people thought they were dealing with a man. \u201cCompanies run by women still have extraordinary difficulty in getting venture capital,\u201d she said. She also worries that lack of diversity in tech is leading to products that have bias programmed into them. \u201cAn example of the industry\u2019s masculinity is in my Apple watch,\u201d she said. \u201cThis has lots of useful things such as heart rate but doesn\u2019t help in managing the menstrual cycle.\u201d Since retiring, Shirley has devoted much of her time and fortune to philanthropic causes linked to autism \u2013 her late son Giles was severely autistic. She argues that technology such as robots and artificial intelligence holds huge potential for helping children with autism function in the world and connect more readily with those around them. This view runs counter to the fears of some that the increasing use of robots could leave some sectors of society, the elderly, for example, cut off from human contact. Such technology is already being tested at Priors Court in Berkshire, a residential school for autistic children that Shirley founded. \u201cWe use a little robot for very simple things,\u201d she said. \u201cTo teach eye contact. To move quietly around and not to dash around in all directions. The reactions of pupils to the robot are extraordinary, partly because it\u2019s not threatening,\u201d she added. \u201cThe robot is patient and can repeat without getting, \u2018Oh God, is this child never going to get it.\u2019\u201d Dame Stephanie Shirley is a guest on this week\u2019s episode of Science Weekly"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
