And we never forget about it. Is there anyone in the world over the age of 35 who can read the words, Robert De Niro's Waiting without hearing an airy, disembodied voice yelp, \"Talking Ital-yah-ha-a-an\"? Such words are locked in your memory, as immovable as your first telephone number. \"This is my only escape from it all,\" sing Bananarama. \"Watching a film or a face on the wall\". The Teenagers are having trouble keeping a lid on their obsession with Scarlett Johansson. \"I'll sell my mum,\" they promise, \"To be lost with you, lost in Tokyo or anywhere else.\" As a, um, \"rock critic\" I am legally obliged to like Yo La Tengo, but songs like Tom Courtenay do make it easy. \"Julie Christie, the rumours are true,\" they sing. \"As the pages turn, my eyes are glued, to the movie star and his sordid life\". Billy Bragg is no stranger to sexual metaphor, so it's no surprise to hear his faultless delivery of Woody Guthrie's line about Ingrid Bergman, \"you're so perty, you'd make fire fly from the crater\". Meanwhile, the Byrds implore a young, wannabe actress to leave the sordid flesh pots of Hollywood and return to the country. \"Mae Jean run back home with me,\" they sing, \"This wicked city's bound to do us harm.\" The actors in Tindersticks' Marriage Made in Heaven are two lovers, caught in a vicious, deceitful spiral. \"She thought there was only her there,\" they sing. \"But, me, I just live for the clapping, a hand delivery of an invite to my premiere.\" Tell that to Roy Orbison who, in 1962, wrote of his own troubles with a woman who could only pretend. \"The way you play on emotion,\" he sings, \"You'd shame the brightest star.\" Hayzi Fantayzee's John Wayne is Big Leggy has, in retrospect, been accused of having suspect lyrics, but how could anyone take issue with, \"He stands so high, it's enough to make any red skin cry\"? Finally, Noel Coward knew that acting was a cruel, shallow business not suited to everybody. \"Admitting the fact, she's burning to act, that isn't quite enough,\" he crowed, back in 1933. \"Sweet Mrs Worthington, don't put your daughter on the stage.\" This week's topic is devastatingly simple. I'm looking for songs about first love, songs that describe the way your heart and brain get squeezed in ways you had never even knew existed when your eyes alight on That Person (or Thing, to be honest). For a lot of people it's an emotional experience they never get over. For quite a few songwriters it's a subject that has provided a deep blue well of inspiration they can draw on for years. What are your favourites? There's a collaborative Spotify playlist here. Deadline is midday Monday; please note that posts should not contain more than a third of a song's lyrics. The A-Z and RR archive are eyeing each other up behind the science block, while the Overspill blog has developed a stammer in the chemists. How embarrassing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
