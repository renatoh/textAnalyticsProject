His comments come as international political and military leaders are increasingly mulling whether negotiating with the Taliban is necessary as the insurgency gains sway in large areas of Afghanistan. Karzai has long supported drawing the Islamist militia into the political mainstream on the condition that they accept the country's constitution. \"If I say I want protection for Mullah Omar, the international community has two choices: remove me or leave if they disagree,\" Karzai said in an hour-long press conference in Kabul. \"If I am removed in the cause of peace for Afghanistan by force by them, than I will be very happy. If they disagree, they can leave. But we are not at that stage yet.\" Omar is a leader of the Afghan Taliban and headed the government toppled by the US-led invasion in 2001. Since then, he has been in hiding and is believed to be running the insurgency. Previously, Karzai has said that Omar lives in neighboring Pakistan, an allegation dismissed by Pakistani officials. Seven years after the invasion, record levels of violence are afflicting Afghanistan, where the number of insurgent attacks are up by 30 percent compared to 2007. The Taliban are present in large parts of Afghanistan's south and east and are increasingly encroaching on Kabul, the capital. In September, Taliban members met Afghan and Pakistani officials during a dinner hosted by Saudi Arabia's king, but there were no concrete results from the meeting. \"If I hear from [Mullah Omar] that he is willing to come to Afghanistan or to negotiate for peace and for the well-being of the Afghans so that our children are not killed anymore, I as president of Afghanistan will go to any length to provide protection,\" Karzai said. Omar has not directly responded to these calls, but spokesmen associated with the Taliban have previously said their participation in any talks depends on the withdrawal of US and other foreign troops from the country. Karzai has dismissed that, saying foreign troops are necessary for Afghanistan's security."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
