Guardian reader Rita", "bodyText": "I am desperately trying to get my kids, who are 11 and 14, to read the Guardian. They love Family and the magazine. I want them to feel, like me, that it belongs to us. Good to Meet You is a powerful manifestation of that, that the Guardian cares about its readers. I live for the Saturday Guardian. My ideal luxury would be to have the time every morning to make myself a cup of tea and read the paper cover to cover, but instead I can only do that at the weekend. To me it is a little piece of sanity in an awful world. My dad was a trade unionist and we had the Mirror at home. But my wonderful A-level teacher said the best way to learn was by reading the Guardian and Observer. I remember my grandad saying, \"What's this? You can't have the kids reading this; it's for the gentry.\" Around the same time I developed a consciousness of who I was becoming, realised I was a feminist and discovered the women's pages. I was involved in the miners' campaign in Yorkshire and there was one moment when I was trying to get to Castleford and the whole junction was blocked off by police in riot gear. It felt as though we were in Chile under Pinochet, with Thatcher using the police as a paramilitary organisation. I got out of the car and started remonstrating with them, asking who did they think they were to seal off parts of the country. After that I had to leave. I lived in a communist village in the south of Spain. When I was there I started teaching adults, and with some reluctance, children. I found my true vocation and came back to Bangor to do my PGCE. After I met my husband Peter, he got offered a good job in Saudi Arabia. We didn't have any money so we went. We would get the Guardian sent to us. When it arrived it was always blacked out and had pages missing \u2013 I don't think I've ever suffered so much. \u2022 This article was amended on 15 March 2010 and on 19 May 2015 to correct the spelling, and subsequent removal of the reader's name at her request."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
