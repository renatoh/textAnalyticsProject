We are considering an interest-only mortgage, whereby we could save and make repayments periodically. We can only afford a 5% deposit. Can you suggest any products? LM A With only a 5% deposit I am afraid your choice is very limited. This is because most lenders have withdrawn the mortgage deals in which they were prepared to lend up to 95% of the value of a property. You would have a lot more choice if you had a 10% deposit, but all is not lost. According to the list of best-buy mortgages published by Moneyfacts, Direct Line is offering a two-year fixed-rate mortgage, which has a maximum loan-to-value of 95%. It also has a reasonable interest rate of 6.39% and offers the chance of making overpayments of up to 10% a year during the fixed-rate period (and unlimited after that). The downside is the up-front fee of \u00a3499 to arrange the mortgage. There is also no guarantee they will lend to you, but you can get an idea of whether this mortgage is an option by using the mortgage acceptance calculator on the Direct Line website."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
