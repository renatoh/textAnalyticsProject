As movies do, it colonised the memory of the book, all the more because it remains one of the most brilliant films made about Australia despite its being, notoriously, created by outsiders. Filmed on location in Broken Hill, Kotcheff\u2019s film is a visceral evocation of the paradoxical claustrophobia of the outback. You can almost smell the sweat as the hapless English teacher, John Grant, is dragged into the underworld of his subconscious fears and desires. You\u2019d think these qualities would be untranslatable to live theatre but, astonishingly, Declan Greene\u2019s adaptation at the Malthouse Theatre powerfully invokes the story. Returning to the book, Greene exploits both the potency of language and the performance skills of Zahra Newman, one of Australia\u2019s most remarkable actors, to recreate Wake in Fright as a contemporary nightmare. It\u2019s an intriguing and potentially disastrous proposition: the gothic anxieties of settler Australia channelled through the body of a woman of colour. But this is not a theatre of pretence, in which an actor merely acts out a make-believe story. It reaches into the roots of theatre, calling on its traditions of ritual and expiation. The actor here is a shaman that summons the voices of the dead. When we enter the auditorium, we\u2019re greeted by a Humphrey B Bear-like mascot bumbling around the bare stage, waving vacuously at audience members as they file in. The performance begins when Newman takes off the head and chattily introduces herself. The mascot, it turns out, is no fiction: he\u2019s called Lead Ted Jnr and he\u2019s used to educate children in Broken Hill about the dangers of lead poisoning. This is necessary, Newman explains, because Broken Hill\u2019s mining tailings shower lead over the town, poisoning the children. High lead levels affect 47% of the town\u2019s children - a percentage that increases among the Aboriginal population to 79%. What\u2019s the point of having a good job, she asks, if that same job kills your children? She told an Uber driver about the children of Broken Hill, she says, after he asked her where she was from. Instead of answering, she asked him where he was from. Broken Hill, he said. \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d is a question that echoes in Wake in Fright as much as in Newman\u2019s encounters with a stranger: it\u2019s an apparent overture towards connection that masks a deeper, instinctive suspicion of the outsider. I\u2019m Australian, Newman tells us, despite this accent, despite my skin. And I\u2019m going to tell you a story. And then, once we\u2019re introduced to our Dantean guide, she steps like a priestess into the circle of theatre lights that is the only stage decoration and begins the story of John Grant, reader of the European classics, who finds himself trapped in Bundanyabba, the fictional analogue of Broken Hill. Newman both narrates and embodies the story, becoming different characters in turn. As Grant plunges deeper into his nightmare, enduring the alcoholic hospitality of the good blokes of the Yabba, \u201cthe best little town in the world\u201d, his fracturing sense of reality is conjured by sound, including the use of a pitch-shifter and looping (James Paul) and driving beats from the electronica band friendships, heightened by Verity Hampson\u2019s precise, brutal lighting. These are supplemented by hallucinatory projected images. At its climax, the notorious kangaroo hunt, the production lets loose a flourish of laser projections that perhaps are the only misjudgement: maybe they are simply too articulate, perhaps this production is crucially about the sound and the presence of Newman\u2019s body. Even so, the whole becomes a totally immersive experience, plunging its audience into Grant\u2019s broken subconscious. Wake in Fright retains its power after all these years because it opens up the abyss of colonial Australia, the spiritual emptiness of a civilisation that squats on the edges of a country it barely understands, clutching the rags of an alienated culture that doesn\u2019t help it to understand itself. There\u2019s no judgement in this performance. The staged ending is much bleaker than the book; we are left with Newman, herself again, and her invitation to ponder Cook\u2019s final conclusion: \u201cI can see quite clearly the ingenuity whereby a man may be made mean or great by exactly the same circumstances.\u201d To be mean or to be great. As it is for Grant, the decision is ultimately up to us. \u2022 Wake in Fright, adapted from Kenneth Cook\u2019s novel by Declan Greene, is showing at Malthouse Theatre, Melbourne, until 14 July"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
