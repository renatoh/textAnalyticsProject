After finishing second in the Six Nations Championship following October's victory over England in Dublin, their best campaign for 15 years, the national coach Warren Gatland was yesterday released from his contract with his assistant Eddie O'Sullivan taking over with immediate effect. It was a reversal of roles from 1997 when O'Sullivan resigned as the Connacht coach and Gatland, the former Waikato and uncapped All Black, was appointed in his place. O'Sullivan helped coach the United States during the last World Cup and was appointed as Gatland's assistant following the failure of Ireland to reach the quarter- finals of the 1999 competition. Despite the relative success he enjoyed with Ireland he always appeared close to the exit door. There were mutterings about his future almost as soon as he had taken over from Brian Ashton in 1998 and even last October, before Ireland played Wales in Cardiff, he was said to be one defeat away from the sack. Gatland's contract was due to run out at the end of next year's Six Nations but he publicly asked for a review before Ireland's rearranged Six Nations match against Scotland in Edinburgh in September. It did not prove a propi- tious time to bring up the issue as it turned out, with the Irish well beaten, and subsequent victories over Wales and England, and a gallant display against the All Blacks, were not enough to prove to the Irish Rugby Football Union that Gatland was the man to take Ireland to the 2003 World Cup and beyond. The review that Gatland asked for took place earlier this week when the coach met the contracts sub-committee of the IRFU. Money was not thought to be the issue, with Gatland believed to be on \u00a3100,000 a year. There were reports of tactical disagreements with O'Sullivan, who yesterday signed a contract which will run until the end of the 2004 Six Nations: the Munster coach Declan Kidney will be his assistant. Gatland wanted more in the way of security but ended up looking for a job. \"I want to thank the players and wish them all the best for the future,\" he said in the language of someone negotiating a pay-off with his employers. \"I look forward to fulfilling a new challenge in rugby.\" Gatland was not sacked but opted to be released from his contract after failing to be given the vote of confidence he was looking for in the form of an extended contract. O'Sullivan had been linked last month with a return to the United States to take charge of their national side and it may have been that the IRFU felt it had to make a choice between the two men. The union was giving little away last night. \"Warren has made a significant contribution since his appointment as the Ireland coach and we wish to record our appreciation of his efforts,\" said the IRFU's chief executive Philip Browne. \"Following detailed reviews it was agreed that it is in the best interests of all concerned to end the contract with immediate effect.\" The New Zealand coach of a Six Nations' country whose future has been much more the subject of speculation in recent weeks spoke of his surprise at Gatland's departure. \"It is a shock,\" said Graham Henry of Wales, Ireland's next opponents in Dublin next February, last night. \"Warren did a superb job for Ireland and deserves nothing but credit for what he achieved.\" The Hamilton-born Gatland made 140 appearances for Waikato and 17 for New Zealand. But in his All Black days he had the misfortune to be understudy to the indestructible hooker Sean Fitzpatrick. When Ireland trooped off the field in Dublin a fortnight ago after a heroic defeat by the All Blacks, little did Gatland know that it was his compatriots who had just pushed him closer to that exit door."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
