Since fraught familial relationships are meat and drink to Loudon's songwriting it seems a no-brainer - though the lyrics about chromosomes in 'X or Y' ('If it's X, a girl is next/If it's Y, you get a guy') are not his finest. Highlights include 'Grey in LA', while Wainwright's cover of Peter Blegvad's 'Daughter' is given an extra twist if you know about his history with daughter Martha."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
