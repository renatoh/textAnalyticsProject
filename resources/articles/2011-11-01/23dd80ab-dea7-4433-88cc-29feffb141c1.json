The manager claimed that he has \"never found racism\" in the England dressing room. The FA have also said they are \"confident\" of reducing Wayne Rooney's three-match ban for next summer's European Championship. Terry, who Capello confirmed will continue as captain, is being investigated by police and the FA about allegations that he made racist comments to Anton Ferdinand during Chelsea's 1-0 defeat at Queens Park Rangers a fortnight ago. While the police have warned the FA that Capello should not say anything prejudicial to their investigation, the Italian was asked at Saturday's lunchtime briefing if there could be a problem with other players in the England dressing room due to Terry's inclusion. Capello said: \"In my experience I never see, I never heard. I never found racism problems in England football. OK. The fans never boo. Never. Racist problems between the players do not exist.\" The decision to include Terry was taken collectively by Capello and the FA executives Adrian Bevington, the managing director, Alex Horne (general secretary), Sir Trevor Brooking (director of football development) and David Bernstein (chairman) before the manager visited Chelsea's training ground at Cobham to speak with the 30-year-old on Friday. \"We had a meeting with the FA yesterday. Everyone spoke about John Terry,\" the Italian said. \"We made the decision together. I spoke also with [Andr\u00e9] Villas-Boas [the Chelsea manager] and he told me John Terry will play [against Blackburn Rovers]. \"For this reason, I said there is no problem with John Terry at this moment. We need to wait what will happen about the FA investigation and the police investigation, but I can tell you he is innocent until proven guilty. This is a really important thing for me and the FA.\" Capello revealed that Rio Ferdinand \u2013 Anton's brother \u2013 will not be in the squad for the two friendlies on Saturday and the following Tuesday though he denied his decision not to select the centre-half had any bearing on the Terry situation but was due to his form. \"I met him Thursday night at Sir Alex [Ferguson's] award [dinner]. I told him: 'Rio, I read what Sir Alex said about you, I think you need to play games.' He told me: 'Yes, I need to play because I need to find good form.' I hope he will be fit and in good form for the Euros.\" Pressed that he could be seen as hiding behind Rio's lack of form rather than excluding him due to sensitivities surrounding his brother and Terry, Capello said: \"No.\" Despite being included, Capello suggested Terry will not play against Spain on Saturday and should feature in only a half against Sweden. One thought may be that Terry will play in the second half in the second of the international friendlies so as to avoid him leading the side out. Capello said: \"That would only be for football reasons. I said to him: 'I don't know if you will play [only a] half against Sweden.' It will be really important to know the value of some players when you play against the world champions.\" Capello denied Terry's inclusion could prove a distraction and initially suggested Frank Lampard may captain England against Spain before drawing back on the statement, hinting the midfielder may not start. He did, however, name the young players who will be selected. \"There will be [Phil] Jones, [Danny] Welbeck, [Daniel] Sturridge. [Jack] Rodwell is possible, we need to wait. [Alex] Oxlade-Chamberlain is in both [the senior and Under-21s squad],\" he said. Regarding Rooney's three-match ban after he was sent off for stamping on Montenegro's Miodrag Dzudovic during the Euro 2012 qualifier, an FA spokesperson said of the documentation the body has received: \"It is a four-page report, our in-house legal team has looked at it. We're confident enough there is a chance of it being reduced.\" \"In terms of the risk of the matches [ban] going longer, if Uefa cross-appeal, they will give us the chance to withdraw our appeal. We're going to employ a specialist sports lawyer expert to help. When Uefa come back and say they have received our notification \u2013 we expect Monday [and] \u2013 we have six days to put in our appeal. We're not sure it's likely Wayne will attend [the hearing]. Anything will be done with the say-so of Manchester United.\" Capello hinted that the FA may focus on Rooney's reaction. \"After the referee showed the red card he walked. We always speak about respect. The respect was perfect. No problem, no shouting. That is a really important thing [for the] appeal.\" Although Capello is almost certain to pick Rooney for the Euro 2012 finals, he did appear to leave his options open. \"We need to wait for the appeal,\" he said, before revealing that Rooney had told him he does not like playing in midfield after he featured there for Manchester United against Otelul Gulati in the Champions League last week. \"He's happy. I spoke to him and said: 'What do you think about your position?' 'Yes it's good because I touch it, I got a lot of passes and everything but I prefer [up front].' Because for the forward the goal is something else.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
