Her debut album, due in summer, is cut from a similar cloth to Allen's \u2013 a collage of tastefully chosen vintage samples, over which she trills her tales of being 21 and pretty in London. Live \u2013 armed only with a drummer, an acoustic guitarist and a standup bassist \u2013 she proves she's not just a studio concoction. Set-opener Missing sees the sampled harmonies from the Fleetwoods' 1959 single Come Softly to Me recreated beautifully by Doolittle and her band. They are the secret stars of the night, and provide a hushed and sympathetic backing that enables her slight but true voice to shine. For Skinny Genes, the guitarist swaps to ukulele, making this the lowest-fi assault on the charts in who knows how long. It's here that the Allen comparisons are most apt, as Doolittle weighs up the merits of a potential boyfriend over lilting ska: \"I really don't like your skinny jeans/ So take them off for me/ Show me what you got underneath.\" Nevertheless, there's no sense of contrivance or cash-in: she's been writing songs since she was 12, apparently, and her ear for a sunny melody is undeniable. After a brisk, fat-free half-hour, she's joined on stage by the vast figure of soul shouter Lloyd Wade for Pack Up. \"I don't care what the people may say/ What the people may say about me,\" she sings, beaming, and the audience beams back, not inclined to say anything cruel. At the Enterprise (020-7485 2659), again on Monday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
