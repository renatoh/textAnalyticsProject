You never know when a fox will try to seduce you or a ghost will attempt to drain your blood. Don\u2019t you just hate it when tiny creatures take residence in your eyes? And why is there always a demon or clay monster to fend off? This is the way of things in the imagination of Pu Songling, the 17th-century author of Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio, a compendium of 431 tales of the supernatural which, on publication 50 years after his death, acquired a Brothers Grimm-like status in China. Adapted by actor Pauline Lockhart and Grid Iron co-artistic director Ben Harrison, eight of these eerie stories contribute to this playful evening of folklore, where sex and death are always at hand and the mystical sits side by side with the everyday. There\u2019s the one in which a husband is restored to life with the phlegm of a beggar; the one where a man sneezes out frog-like creatures from his nose; and the one where an initiate takes a shortcut to learn the esoteric skills of a Taoist priest only to fall flat on his face. As Lockhart talks about Ouija boards and tarot cards, the mood is campfire spooky. Something in the fairytale directness of the stories, with their unquestioning acceptance of the spirit world, makes us credulous and receptive. Of course a woman can rejoin humanity after 20 years as a ghost and a beautiful stranger is a demon in human form. The Scottish actor is joined by Luna Dai (born in China) and Robin Khor Yong Kuan (Malaysian Chinese) to play out the archetypal tales, making merry use of puppetry and magic as they go. On Karen Tennent\u2019s papery set, they have a storyteller\u2019s way of stepping in and out of character, repeatedly reminding us to listen in the right way for fear the stories will trap us in some netherworld. A couple of stories end abruptly, but in the main, they work as a wintry feast of the uncanny. \u2022At Traverse, Edinburgh, until 21 December."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
