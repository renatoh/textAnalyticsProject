The sides duly served up a stalemate. But if that was wholly predictable, like City getting themselves into a pickle almost every springtime, the lack of goals after plenty of goalmouth pinball but precious little wizardry came as a surprise. \"It could have been 3-3,\" opined the Coventry manager Gordon Strachan. That the irascible Scot was not left cursing some all-too-familiar phil anthropy from his defenders owed much to a cocktail of profligate finishing by Chelsea and excellent goalkeeping by Chris Kirkland. Strachan took something of a gamble by dropping the Swedish international Magnus Hedman and replacing him with a teenager whose only other game against Chelsea had ended in tears. At Stamford bridge in November the 19-year-old Kirkland was wrongly sent off and Chelsea won 6-1. With City showing the never-say-die qualities which may yet prove the decisive factor in preserving their Premiership status, there was never any danger of a repeat humiliation. According to Chelsea's captain Dennis Wise, however, the difference between a draw and long-overdue away win for his side was Kirkland. \"He saved them,\" said Wise. \"I first came across him at an England training camp and I thought he was good then. He proved that against us and I'm sure he's got a bright future.\" Though Kirkland's presence augurs well for their defence, Coventry still have a problem scoring despite the arrival of John Hartson. His trademark strongarm tactics, including dispatching Marcel Desailly into an advertising hoarding as the pair tried to claim the ball for a throw-in, unsettled the Chelsea defence. But City lack a predator to play alongside the Welsh international and feed off his headed knockdowns and flick-ons. With the best will in the world Craig Bellamy is no Ian Wright but rather a winger who creates chances, as he did for David Thompson and Moustapha Hadji. Both went begging and City are still searching for the win that Strachan believes will move their fight for survival into overdrive. \"I have not set a target of wins,\" he said, \"but I am convinced that once we get one we will be on our way. \"We had enough chances to beat Chelsea and those chances were made by sheer endeavour rather than skill. You cannot expect teams at the bottom of the league to play cosmic football.\" Increasingly you cannot expect Chelsea to play cosmic football either. But that is a view not shared by Wise, who said: \"People are bound to be impatient because of all the success we've enjoyed. But it's a new time now and we've got to get on with it. That means getting this season out of the way and in some way qualifying for Europe.\" Via the Inter-Toto Cup, perhaps? \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
