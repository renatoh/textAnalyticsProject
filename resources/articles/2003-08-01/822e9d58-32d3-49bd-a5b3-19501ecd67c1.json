London Underground said 60% of the network had been affected by the National Grid failure along with thousands of passengers. The power went out at about 6.15pm, and an hour and a half later commuters were still milling in front of Tube stations, uncertain of how to continue their journeys. A London Underground spokeswoman said: \"Stations and trains are being evacuated. Trains that are in tunnels will be de-trained. Staff will go down to the train and take (passengers) down the tunnel bit by bit and make sure they get onto the platform and leave the station safely.\" Speaking at about 7.30pm, she said: \"We are seeking alternative power feeds from north London. Power should be restored fairly quickly, in the next half an hour.\" She said some stations had been closed and 250 sets of traffic lights had also been hit by the blackout. The London mayor, Ken Livingstone, branded the situation a \"disgrace\", and said there would have to be an immediate investigation into whether there had been underinvestment in the power grid. Rail services from major stations including Victoria, London Bridge and Waterloo were also affected. By 7pm power had been restored to some blacked-out parts of the capital, including Bank and Waterloo. Trains stopped at stations began moving again. A spokesman for electricity network operator EDF Energy said: \"We have lost supplies to large parts of south London in the last few minutes as a result of a National Grid failure supply in the south London area. It's difficult to predict how long this is going to take. National Grid has got to get the circuit back.\" A spokesman for British Transport Police said the power cut had affected all major railway stations in south London. \"There is no power in a lot of stations and no trains running in the whole of south London,\" he said. \"All major stations - Victoria, London Bridge, Waterloo - are affected and all main train lines have stopped. Some stations are in darkness and others have emergency lighting.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
