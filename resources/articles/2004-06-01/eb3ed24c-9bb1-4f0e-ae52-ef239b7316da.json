Three appeal judges were told today, as the appeal hearing started, that Jenkins's former wife Lois, who divorced him soon after his conviction in 1998, had flown to Britain from her new home in Tasmania and would be called as a witness by the prosecution. Two of her daughters - Lottie, 17, and Annie, 19, who were with Jenkins on the day of the killing - are due to be called as alibi witnesses by their father's legal team. They were not called as witnesses at his trial. Lottie has travelled from Australia to Britain to give evidence in the court of appeal, and her sister has made a statement in a video recording. The appeal hearing, set to last for up to three weeks, could not begin properly on schedule today because the senior judge appointed to the case was taken ill over the weekend. Lord Justice Kay's place was taken by Lord Justice Rose, who said he needed time to read up on the case. The hearing, in which he will sit with Mr Justice Curtis and Mr Justice Wakerley, was adjourned until Wednesday. It is understood that when it opens fully fresh argument will be heard relating to microscopic spots of blood found on Jenkins's jacket, which he claims must have been spattered as he attended the dying girl and a bubble of blood burst in her nose. The court was told at a preliminary hearing that a mentally ill man, who was known to have been in the vicinity when Billie-Jo was killed, had shown signs of having a fixation with pushing pieces of plastic bag up his nose. A pathologist found that Billy-Jo had part of a black bin-liner stuffed deeply into one of her nostrils. The significance of this evidence is still in doubt. Jenkins, who is in his late 40s, was jailed for life for bludgeoning Billie-Jo to death with a metal tent spike as she painted a patio door at their home in Hastings, East Sussex, in 1997. The jury at his trial, held at Lewes crown court in 1998, was told that, after attacking her, he went shopping at a local DIY store with two of his four other daughters, then pretended to discover Billie-Jo's body when he returned. There were more than 150 microscopic spots of the teenager's blood on Jenkins's jacket, which were consistent only with his having been the attacker, the court was told at the trial. In December 1999, the court of appeal rejected Jenkins's initial appeal. But in April 2001, a file containing new evidence was handed to the criminal cases review commission and a fresh appeal was ordered."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
