Professional dancer James Jordan required stitches after an unfortunate collision between his head and the elbow of his wife (and dancing partner) Ola. \"It was my fault,\" said Jordan. \"I went too early and she hit me in the eye.\" The mishap felt symptomatic of the Wednesday night recording of the series opener, which will air on BBC1 on Saturday. New judge Darcey Bussell's debut \u2013 and only \u2013 dance of the series had to be stopped after a steadycam operator collapsed in a heap, narrowly missing an octagenarian fan in a wheelchair. It wasn't the only dance that had to be reshot \u2013 ah, the magic of television! \u2013 and it was only once the celebrities finally took to the stage that you remembered why the BBC1 dance show has so captured the public imagination. Where else can you can see two Olympic medallists (Victoria Pendleton and Louis Smith) up close and personal, throwing shapes on the dance floor and \u2013 let's face it \u2013 potentially making fools of themselves. And who would have predicted when Michael Vaughan won the Ashes in 2005 that he would one day be sashaying around BBC Television Centre's studio one in the arms of Mick Jagger's ex, Jerry Hall? \"She is the funniest lady I have ever met,\" said the former England cricket captain. \"She has had us in stitches; her one-liners are gold dust.\" As for Hall, she looked by some distance the most laid back of any of the celebrity contestants. \"I love scaring myself, doing something that's a challenge,\" said the model turned TV presenter in her familiar Texan drawl. \"I've done a few steps in Bus Stop and High Society, but I haven't really danced. When I told my sons they were like, 'wow, that's amazing'. My daughters said, 'aren't you kind of lazy?'. I said, 'I cook a lot.'\" In any other year it would be Girls Aloud star Kimberley Walsh and Nicky Byrne, formerly of Westlife, garnering all the attention. But this is Olympics year, so it will inevitably be Pendleton, the gold-medal winning queen of the velodrome, and Smith, the gymnast who won silver and bronze at London 2012, upon whom the spotlight will linger. \"To perform in an arena with no expectation is so different to the velodrome,\" said Pendleton. \"It's going to be fun, a new challenge and an opportunity to meet people I would never normally cross paths with.\" Like former EastEnders star Sid Owen, presumably, and Daybreak presenter Richard Arnold. Others taking part include 74-year-old TV presenter Johnny Ball, father of Zo\u00eb, a previous Strictly contestant, and former Emmerdale actress Lisa Riley who said she was doing it for \"all the chubbers\" at home. Denise Van Outen is the early favourite, and also a focus of early (mild) controversy around her previous dancing experience. Chris Evans used his Radio 2 show to ask: \"Should Denise Van Outen be allowed to appear on Strictly as she's appeared in a musical actually dancing?\" Van Outen, who went to the renowned Sylvia Young Theatre School said she performed one dance when she appeared in Chicago 11 years ago but had not strutted her stuff since. But it's not just about the dancing, said Jordan, eye suitably patched up for the cameras. \"At the end of the day it's about popularity as well. Chris Hollins was not the best dancer but people loved and adored him.\" The BBC's controller of entertainment commissioning, Mark Linsey, said Strictly Come Dancing \u2013 now into its 10th series and once again hosted by Sir Bruce Forsyth and Tess Daley \u2013 \"epitomises what entertainment on BBC1 should be about. It brings the whole family in front of the television.\" The show will also resume its Saturday night rivalry with ITV1's The X Factor, which it eclipsed for the first time last year. But there is not expected to be a repeat of the scheduling clash between BBC1's The Voice and ITV1's other Simon Cowell show, Britain's Got Talent, in the spring. Nevertheless, Forsyth couldn't resist renewing his rivalry with X Factor judge Louis Walsh. Referring to Walsh as a \"karaoke judge\", Forsyth said the former Westlife manager could not \"make a comeback because he hasn't been anywhere\". The pairings of the celebrity and professional dancers is being kept under wraps by the BBC until Saturday's transmission. It will then return in three weeks' time when the dancing will begin in earnest. Vaughan is not the only former England cricketer trying something new. All-rounder Freddie Flintoff is becoming a pro boxer for a new show on Sky 1. \"I know this is tough but I'm not going to be hit by a heavyweight boxer,\" said Vaughan. \"He's mental. Brave but, gosh ... madness.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
