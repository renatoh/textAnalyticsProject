James Marape was speaking at an investor summit in Port Moresby on Wednesday, where he outlined his vision to boost PNG\u2019s economic prospects. \u201cAt this time let me \u2026 just give you an indication as where we might go: Manus will be declared as the first corporate tax-free zone in our country,\u201d Marape said. \u201cWe can still collect tax from other areas.\u201d He gave no more details and his office told Guardian Australia the proposal would be fleshed out by the treasurer at some point. Jason Ward, of the Centre for International Corporate Tax Accountability and Research, said the proposal was vague but sounded like it intended to make Manus the first of PNG\u2019s 22 provinces to become a tax haven. Ward said the proposal could prove lucrative for Australian companies based in Manus but running operations elsewhere. \u201cIn the context of the speech it sounds like the conclusion is that Manus has no other economic potential,\u201d Ward said. \u201cThis has obvious consequences for tax collections in the rest of PNG and elsewhere, including Australia, for companies that set up there to take advantage of no corporate tax but have operations outside of Manus.\u201d Marape reportedly said the intention to make Manus a tax-free zone was in response to the regular negative exposure the island had received. He also signalled he planned to cut red tape for business and said he was \u201call about maximising gain from the resources that we have in this country\u201d. \u201cWe intend to remove impediments in the system so that you will have ease of doing business,\u201d Marape said. \u201cGone are the days where you think you owe a favour to a politician to push your papers through for you. \u201cWe want to remove impediments in the system so that your project submissions, you\u2019re dealing with [the] government, is done with less blockages.\u201d At the same time he voiced his support for new whistleblower protections and anti-corruption measures. \u201cWe are trying to create a safe environment and give you, as businessmen and business women and as company, the impetus as businessmen, businesswomen and company that you have a safe environment that is less susceptible to corruption and bribery and lawlessness,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can then ensure that you grow as a business in our country and together we can prosper. \u201cYou can prosper for your shareholders and we prosper for our shareholders, the 8 million people of Papua New Guinea.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
