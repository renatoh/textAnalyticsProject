I had recently left school, and it was my first time out of Europe. As I made my way around the country on a series of buses, I wrote long and scarcely legible letters to my friends and family, detailing people, places, and adventures. I'd calculate where I might be when they got around to replying, and request a letter back to the appropriate poste restante. When I arrived there, I'd queue, snatch my letters from a nonchalant official and take them away, elated. Today, the homesick traveller simply waits for Hotmail to download on to a computer. She will instantly be transported back to a world where Auntie Jean is coming to lunch, and where her closest friend has been on a date with someone intriguing. Someone in the office might have been promoted; someone else is leaving. The snippets from home are comforting, but they take away something of the essence of a big trip. Recently, I travelled around the world for a year, and this time I found email just about everywhere. Of course, I was delighted. I knew that if I was feeling lonely, I could spend half an hour in a 'cybercafe' and walk out happy. I emailed my mum from Lhasa, high up on the Tibetan plateau. In Pakistan and India, in Vietnam and Mongolia, wherever there was a major population centre, there was an email terminal. Thamel, the travellers' district of Kathmandu, is crammed with rival establishments, each jostling to offer more inducements than the last. Air- conditioned surroundings, 24-hour generators to combat power cuts, magazines to read while you wait... it won't be long before they offer an Everest trek as a perk. I try to imagine turning my back on it, and choosing not to email, but, rather, to go back to the heady days of the scrawled sheets. It is a difficult prospect. Africa and South America are less attuned to the desires of Western backpackers than Asia, so, outside the cities, you are far less likely to stumble across a welcoming terminal. In much of Asia, however, travellers have come to accept efficient email as a right. On a few occasions, I watched Westerners harangue a proprietor because the system had crashed. They seemed to feel he was personally responsible for the fact that Indian phone lines are not as reliable as European ones. On the other hand, India and Pakistan were the countries in which most local people joined the travellers at the terminals. In Peshawar, in north-east Pakistan, a man at the next terminal was typing out his CV, with a crowd gathered around him. He politely asked me why the computer was underlining half his words with green squiggles. 'It's just Microsoft,' I explained. 'It does that. It's annoying.' He nodded sagely. 'Annoying,' he agreed. Within minutes, his CV had been emailed to a prospective employer. One of the more delectable facets of travellers' email is the fact that it gives a whole new lease of life to one of my favourite formats - the round-robin letter. Because of the pressures of time, backpackers frequently write a newsletter and email it to everyone. 'Well! What can I say? Last week we landed in India and it is a culture shock to put it mildly. We have learned never to give to beggars as it merely encourages them. This is a very spiritual place...' I love receiving these, though not always for the reasons their writers intended. On my trip to Australia, however, I loved going to the poste restante more. I remember sitting down outside a post office, and reading a long letter from my best friend, telling me all her news from university. It brought me more joy than a host of emails ever could. Maybe I'm just being nostalgic, but I felt that, in cutting myself off from everyone and everything I knew, I had earned my letters."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
