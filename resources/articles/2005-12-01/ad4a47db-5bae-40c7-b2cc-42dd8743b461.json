Beaumont College in Lancaster - which aims to provide people with physical and learning disabilities with the means to live independently - was deemed to be performing inadequately in both its leadership and its capacity to improve, in a new-style assessment which took place in October. But the school was praised for the effectiveness of its teaching and it received an overall \"satisfactory\" rating. The inspection found that the school had been slow to tackle various problems - one of those being the inadequate residential accommodation that led to the college breaching the Special Educational Needs Disability Act (Senda). In response, Scope spokesman Barry Hugill said: \"We're aware of the problems, certainly in terms of the accommodation and it's something we're looking at. We're sorry that the inspectorate thinks our response was slow. We fully accept that there are problems, and we are doing our very, very best to address that.\" He said that the Senda breach was due to the fact that the buildings were old and had not been sufficiently brought up to date. Beaumont House breached race relations laws because it does not have in place a procedure to monitor the effect of its race policies. \"It's not a criticism of our actual practice and we fully take on board what they said,\" Mr Hugill said. He highlighted that the first meeting of an equality and fairness committee had recently met to address this. Improvements to accommodation have accelerated recently, the report noted. Leadership issues were also highlighted by Ofsted at the last inspection - and today's report said Scope has been very slow to address significant weaknesses. There were questions as to whether Scope would continue to fund the school, leading to inadequate management: the report noted that no business plan was in place, nor a costed development plan. Mr Hugill says that these are now under way. \"Learners' achievements are good. Success rates in a range of national wards are good. All learners make significant gains in confidence, communication skills, and adopting appropriate behaviour.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
