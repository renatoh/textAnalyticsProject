RUNNER-UP Paul Dickov: Back at Boundary Park and celebrating Oldham's equaliser as if his sacking had never happened. \"I'm really pleased for the players. It's hard to say what it means to the club \u2013 it's fantastic.\" FACT OF THE DAY 8: The number of top-flight sides knocked out of the cup by lower-league opposition so far \u2013 twice as many as last season. TIMING OF THE DAY Alan Smith: Announced as the sponsor's man of the match at MK Dons two seconds before picking up a trademark red card. REGRET OF THE DAY Danny Baker, via Twitter: \"Most Millwall supporters are disappointed Arsenal are out. Not because we fancied a 'glamour' tie but because Blackburn will be harder to beat.\" REF OF THE DAY Mike Dean: Maintaining his record of overseeing Arsenal's lowest moments. They've won just one of their last 17 league games with him in charge, and have now lost their last three Dean-refereed cup ties too. RETURN OF THE DAY Southend's Bilel Mohsni was sent packing on loan last year over his lively disciplinary record and habit of irritating team-mates. He was recalled due to injuries \u2013 and the result? A red card 26 minutes in. FAN OF THE DAY Luton's veteran cheerleader: keeping the support alive to the end despite their defeat."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
