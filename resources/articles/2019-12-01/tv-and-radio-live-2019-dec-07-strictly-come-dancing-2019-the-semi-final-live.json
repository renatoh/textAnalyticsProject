All that remains is for us to gather our loved ones round the television for next Saturday\u2019s Grand Final, when we\u2019ll find out whether Kelvin, Karim or Emma will lift this year\u2019s Strictly glitterball. In these times of political madness, we all need shiny things to look forward to. Thank you all for joining in this weekend \u2013 feel free to swing by Twitter @heidistephens and tell me who you think is going to win, or use the convenient comment box provided below. Also PLEASE VOTE ON THURSDAY. See you at 7.05pm next week! They take to the floor for their final dance, to \u2018That\u2019s What Friends Are For\u2019 by Dionne Warwick. There\u2019s a bit of country dancing, but sadly no conga. Ah well. Chris says lovely things about Karen, and their montage shows how far Chris has come since Week One. Karen reciprocates, it\u2019s clear these two have become great mates. Judging time! As expected they all save Karim and Amy, which means CHRIS AND KAREN are leaving Strictly. Big hugs all round. Very happy to watch Karim\u2019s American Smooth again \u2013 I wasn\u2019t hugely inspired last night but keen to give it another spin. He looks happier and more relaxed this time round, and his footwork is impeccable. Assuming he doesn\u2019t pile into the Lib Dem bus, we\u2019ll be seeing these two next week. Dance off time! Chris and Karen are up first, dancing their non-Rumba. Her dress is stunning, 100% would wear to Morrisons. Daughter and I are discussing what brand of sports bra Oti wears, just to fill the time. Time for another montage \u2013 get used to the filler, next week has more than Craig\u2019s forehead. Aside from this being a conclusion so foregone it\u2019s already put its coat and shoes on, it\u2019s interesting that the public have saved Emma and Anton from the dance-off \u2013 that has to make them contenders for the glitterball next week, surely? That said, they\u2019re going to need a pretty special Showdance to beat Kelvin and Karim, who I suspect will both deliver absolute showstoppers. Who is joining Karim and Amy in tonight\u2019s final dance-off? So much tension, but glad we no longer have to do this fifteen times. CHRIS AND KAREN are in the dance-off, which means Emma and Anton are safe. Taxi for Chris. Motsi looks like one of the Snowths from the muppets. Mahna Mahna doo doo do do do. Ooh, love a judges\u2019 montage. Anton\u2019s teeth is my favourite moment of the series. Niall is singing his new singing, Nice To Meet You, accompanied by Katya and Gorka doing some quite hot dancing. Time for a musical interlude, courtesy of Niall Horan. You may remember him from being the one nobody remembers from One Direction, although he\u2019s actually my favourite and arguably the most talented, don\u2019t @ me. So who is definitely through to next week\u2019s Grand Final? Kelvin and Oti are through, which is no surprise at all. First couple in the bottom two \u2013 KARIM AND AMY. Well they\u2019re safe \u2013 the judges will never save Emma or Chris over Karim. Last night on Strictly: a HUGE semi. Loved Kelvin\u2019s performances, and totally admired the ambition of Karim\u2019s \u2013 at this stage he\u2019s the one pushing the dance boundaries when it would be easy for him to phone it in and coast to the final. I loved Emma and Anton\u2019s interpretive Waltz, less so their Cha Cha. Chris gets all the points for bringing personality and journey to this year\u2019s show, but he clearly struggled with the demands of two dances. Motsi was high on something, dishing out tens like canapes at a cocktail party. Good LORD, what IS Motsi wearing? It\u2019s so\u2026PINK. And appears to feature a shower cap, which is niche. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: Tess being strangled by a giant tuna, Claudia in a rather lovely black halterneck. So the general gist of this is that Carlos has taken a fancy to a very frilly Katya, which he demonstrates by flinging her around a bit. Marvellous. Tonight\u2019s opening pro dance features Cuban ballet superstar Carlos Acosta. Earlier in the year he was rumoured to be Darcey\u2019s replacement, but instead we were blessed with the force of nature that is Motsi Mabuse, and Carlos dancing tonight instead. Am very happy with this arrangement. And we\u2019re off! These credits are still making me sad, we should still have Dev and Michelle but they are sadly no longer with us. Caught up with the final Countryside Casual Weather of the year earlier, presented by weathery charmster Darren Bett in a muted pink shirt. Bonus points for the rolled-up sleeves, but those same points deducted for an overly-demure neckline. Would it have been too much to celebrate the festive season with Tomasz Schafernaker fresh from the gym? Evening all, and welcome back to this week\u2019s Strictly results show! We\u2019ve reached the business end of the competition now, when we need to let the last couple go before next week\u2019s Grand Final. Common sense says this will be Chris and Karen, but we all know how much the Strictly viewer loves an underdog, and Craig\u2019s four last night may have been enough to bring out the vote. I\u2019m liveblogging this evening from an extremely low cost hotel in Plymouth, where the daughter is having her tonsils out in the morning (in Plymouth, not in a low cost hotel). On the upside this means I have said daughter with me for the first time this series, and she\u2019ll be home for the Grand Final next weekend. On the downside I\u2019m dependent on unknown WiFi, so talk amongst yourselves if I briefly disappear. Kick off is at 7.20pm \u2013 see you then! So that\u2019s it for tonight\u2019s semi-final dancing! Thank you for joining in - I\u2019ll be back tomorrow night at 7.20pm to find out which three couples are going through to next week\u2019s GRAND FINAL. My money\u2019s on Chris and Karen leaving tomorrow, unless by some public voting insanity they can stay out of the bottom two. Enjoy the rest of your Saturday, and I\u2019ll see you then! After two dances the leaderboard hasn\u2019t changed \u2013 Kelvin and Karim hogging the top half, Emma and Chris at the bottom. The voting is open! Time for a recap \u2013 my faves dances were definitely both of Kelvin and Oti\u2019s, but as a TWO DANCES week goes, that was actually pretty decent. Scores: 9,10,9,10 \u2013 a total of 38 for Karim and Amy. At this point tens have been rendered entirely meanlingless. Amy is crying. DRINK. Also journey. DRINK. Motsi thought it was technically excellent, and Shirley agrees although the lift wasn\u2019t very good. Bruno thought it was perfectly pitched storytelling, but Craig agrees about the lift - however the dance itself was absolutely incredible. Clearly I need to watch that again. Ooh, a carboard bus! Well this should be entirely charming, but would be nice if Karim didn\u2019t look like he\u2019d just come from ballet class and wasn\u2019t really in the mood for a Smooth. Technically good, but for a song like this it could be SO much more fun. Bit disappointed. And finally for tonight it\u2019s KARIM AND AMY! Their second dance is the American Smooth to \u2018Sweet Caroline\u2019 by Neil Diamond. This reminds me of a rowdy singalong at my sister\u2019s wedding last year that started before we\u2019d even sat down for dinner. BA BA BAAAAH. Incidentally, Abbey and Aljaz also danced the American Smooth to this song in the 2013 semi-final, and then went on to win the competition. QUICK BUY YOUR TICKETS FOR THE LIVE TOUR. Chris has worked very hard \u2013 DRINK. Scores: 4,8,8,8 \u2013 a total of 28 for Chris and Karen. He\u2019s going to be bottom of the leader board either way, so it doesn\u2019t really matter. Craig thought that was wrong dance, wrong day. Motsi liked the sensitivity but a bit more Rumba would have been nice. Shirley thought one step was executed very well, but it lacked body action. Bruno thought Chris gave great depth of feeling, even though it was technically lacking. Chris had made it clear that this is not a sexy Rumba, which kind of defeats the purpose of a Rumba. He gets round this by not really dancing a Rumba at all \u2013 there\u2019s no real hip action but he does tell a nice story that involves wandering off at the end. Good lord, Kelvin giving it full Spanish line in a mesh top is quite something. This has all the drama and intent we love in a Paso, whilst also being incredibly masculine and beautifully delivered despite the wobbly ending. My favourite Paso in AGES. It\u2019s time for CHRIS AND KAREN! Their second dance is a Rumba to \u2018Don\u2019t Watch Me Cry\u2019 by Jorja Smith. It\u2019s reasonable to assume this will literally be a \u2018semi rumba\u2019, because a) it\u2019s Chris and b) he\u2019s only had half a week. Of course he could absolutely smash this and surprise us all, I am prepared to entertain this possibility. Scores: 9,10,9,9 \u2013 a total of 37 for Kelvin and Oti. Motsi doesn\u2019t give a HOOT this evening. Bruno thought Kelvin looked like the ultimate Paso action hero \u2013 parts of it had a sculptural beauty but there were a couple of moments where Kelvin could have stretched it even further. Craig thought it was slightly measured and needed more extension, and Kelvin was out of time at the beginning, but otherwise impressive. Motsi loved how Kelvin kept the line tight, and Kelvin has Motsi\u2019s respect. Shirley agrees there were some impressive moments but there were some bits off balance \u2013 all in all a great job. Next up it\u2019s KELVIN AND OTI! Their second dance is the Paso Doble to \u2018Seven Nation Army\u2019 by The White Stripes. I have extremely high hopes for this having all the drive, attitude and menace we look for in a Paso, plus bonus Oti. Anton is crying. DRINK. Journey \u2013 DRINK! Scores: 8,9,9,10 \u2013 a total of 36 for Emma and Anton. Sure. Shirley loved how Emma and Anton danced at the end of the beat, and Emma had some lovely footwork despite a few tiny stumbles. Bruno thought it had natural elegance and a hypnotic beauty, and they managed the changing tempo the music beautifully. Craig thought Emma missed her frame on occasion and also a LOT of heel leads. Motsi thought it was the purest form of dancing. This feels like an odd piece of music for a Waltz, but they\u2019re doing a lovely job of it. Emma looks so much happier in ballroom, I like the understated elegance of this. Time for another round of dancing! First up it\u2019s EMMA AND ANTON. Their second dance is the Waltz to \u2018Gymnop\u00e9die No.1\u2019 by Erik Satie. How do you get to Week 12 having not done a Cha Cha Cha or a Waltz? They used to be the ones couples did first, feels weird wheeling out one of the basics in Week 12 when we should be getting a look at your Argentine Tango by now. Half way leader board \u2013 Kelcin and Oti at the top, Chris and Karen at the bottom. All as expected, interested to see what the second half brings. Scores: 8,10,9,9 \u2013 a total of 36 for Karim and Amy. Oh Motsi, really? Motsi thought it was intense and had 110% intimacy. Shirley thought it was one of the most difficult Argentine routines she\u2019s seen, but Karim\u2019s foot was wobbly in places. Bruno thought it was manly and moody, and the structure and content was difficult. It didn\u2019t have Karim\u2019s usual slick balance, but the last section of ganchos was splendid. Craig agrees there were balance issues, but there was a lot right with it too \u2013 a bit too aggressive for him and not enough Argentine Tango flavour. I never really know what I\u2019m looking for in a great Argentine, but Karim is doing a lovely job of hauling Amy round the dancefloor in an incredibly inefficient manner. He doesn\u2019t look entirely stable at times but some nice flicky legs. It\u2019s a passion-free zone, as expected. Also, those trousers. Lovely to see Vincent Simone doing this choreography for this dance. I miss Vincent and Flavia. And finally for this first round it\u2019s KARIM AND AMY! Their first dance is the Argentine Tango to \u2018Libertango\u2019 by Bond. It feels a shame we\u2019ll only see two Argentines this series, and I have a feeling we might file this one under \u2018technically excellent but lacks passion\u2019. Incidentally, it would be very much in Strictly\u2019s interests if Karim and Amy won the glitterball this season \u2013 they\u2019re the only couple left who will dance with each other on the Strictly live tour. Emma is dancing with Graziano, Kelvin with Janette, and Chris isn\u2019t touring at all. Scores: 7,7,6,6 \u2013 a total of 26 for Chris and Karen. Craig thought it could have been a bit smoother and it went wrong, but he\u2019s proud of Chris for how far he\u2019s come. Motsi loves how Chris\u2019s eyes sparkle when he dances, and he did a great job. Shirley thought there were too many mistakes but she admires Chris for carrying on. Bruno appreciated Chris\u2019s hard work and his ballroom has improved, but tonight his footwork went off the rails. Chris looks very dapper in black velvet and braiding, and this is absolutely not the worst Viennese Waltz we\u2019ve ever seen. But it\u2019s not great either \u2013 his footwork goes a bit awry in place and the timing is a bit shaky. That said, he\u2019s this year\u2019s biggest improver and looks like he\u2019s having a lovely time. Anyone else still thinking about Kelvin\u2019s woodpecker? It\u2019s time for CHRIS AND KAREN! Their first dance is the Viennese Waltz to \u2018Somebody To Love\u2019 by Queen. I love the Viennese and I love this song \u2013 it\u2019s an old Strictly fave, this is the fourth time it\u2019s been wheeled out over the years. Intrigued that Chris is saving the Rumba for his second dance \u2013 either this Viennese is particularly bad, or his Rumba is incredible. Or maybe so bad it\u2019s at least memorable? Scores: 10,10,10,10 \u2013 DRINK DRINK DRINK. Kelvin is crying. DRINK MORE. Bruno thought that was a sparkling delight \u2013 it had light footwork, precision and incredible musicality. Craig was quite upset because he couldn\u2019t find much wrong with it. Motsi was wowed too, Kelvin could have played it safe but it it was a complex routine. Shirley loved the pendulum swings and Kelvin\u2019s woodpecker was amazing. Bruno has lost it. Lovely to the see the return of the Strictly caf\u00e9 table, and Oti\u2019s floral dress is glorious. Kelvin is making light work of this Quickstep \u2013 he\u2019s absolutely the most versatile dancer on this year\u2019s show. Lovely light footwork and incredible timing \u2013 enjoyed that very much. Next up it\u2019s KELVIN AND OTI! Their first dance is the Quickstep to \u2018The Lady is a Tramp\u2019 by Glee Cast. Sophie and Brendan did a lovely Quickstep to this years back, I\u2019m very much here for the Kelvin/Oti revival. Scores: 7,8,8,8 \u2013 a total of 31 for Emma and Anton. Shirley thought that was a massive improvement on Emma\u2019s first Latin dance, but it needed better leg action. Bruno thought it was a very strong performance, and Emma sold it like the ultimate showgirl. Craig thought it lacked hip action and Emma lost her balance, although Anton thought that might be him because he got over-excited. Motsi thought it was amazing considering the pressure Emma is under. Love Emma\u2019s gold tinsel frock, but this Cha Cha needs warming up through the hips, or at least a couple of sambucas beforehand. All a bit stiff and clunky from where I\u2019m sitting, but Emma is definitely selling it. It\u2019s \u2018message of support\u2019 VT week \u2013 a mix of people off \u2018Enders and some random fans with cute kids. First up tonight it\u2019s EMMA AND ANTON! Their opening spin around the dancefloor is a Cha Cha Cha to \u2018Hold My Hand\u2019 by Jess Glynne. Anton\u2019s campaign of uptempo Latin avoidance has hit a dead end, it was either this or the Samba, and I for one am grateful \u2013 the memories of Anton\u2019s Samba turns with both Susannah Constantine and Ruth Langsford are still etched into my eyeballs. Out come the stars! No bare chests for this round, but Karim has horrible trousers and a serious eyeliner game. Out come the judges! Motsi\u2019s gone full camo netting. TESS AND CLAUDIA DRESS WATCH: Tess in a black bandage with only one shoulder, Claudia in a black tux and a killer fringe. I rather like both. And we\u2019re off! It\u2019s the Strictly semi final, and a place in the final is at stake. Yes, we understand how the process works, thanks. Kelvin will do ANYTHING to get into the final. Suggest somebody puts Bingo Nanna in a safe house. This week\u2019s Strictly Come Bingo \u2013 a swing of something you were definitely keeping for Christmas for any occurrence of the following: Four tens Contestants being exhausted Any mention of journey Last ditch family members Crying For the most part I\u2019m sad that Strictly is ending next week, but on the upside it means we\u2019ll never have to watch this terrible pop quiz again. Although the BBC website tells me this is series 2 - how on earth did this get a second series? Alan Partridge would be livid. Evening all, and welcome to this week\u2019s Strictly Come Dancing liveblog! It\u2019s semi final time at last - this time next week we\u2019ll be readying ourselves for a final spin around the Strictly dancefloor, followed by ten days of Christmas panic. Where once our lives were dusted with glitter, we\u2019ll soon be festooned with sprouts and pigs in blankets. Tonight\u2019s show is a serious business, and there are questions to be answered. Is Anton destined for his second ever Grand Final, or his first if you\u2019ve chosen to erase Katie Derham from Strictly history? Will Karim get anything other than a ten? Is Kelvin about to get his chest out? Can Chris manage two dances? I\u2019d say yes/no/yes/no, but feel free to disagree down below. Heidi\u2019s Hunches say that it HAS to be a Karim/Kelvin/Emma final, but tonight\u2019s two-dance marathon could send all remaining sense and reason out of the window, judging-wise. I\u2019ll be up here from 7pm to keep a beady eye on all things dance, and would be delighted if you could sprinkle a little magic and sparkle in the comment box below. There are only two weeks left, so find that bonus bag of glitter down the back of the sofa. See you in a bit!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
