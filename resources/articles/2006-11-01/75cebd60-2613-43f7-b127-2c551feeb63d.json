Puff yourself up", "bodyText": "Smokers are bad. Fidel Castro? There must be some reason why the White House has failed to kick its unhealthy 50-year obsession with the Cohiba-munching Cuban leader. The Marlboro Man? He may be the epitome of American frontier ruggedness in front of the lens; but off camera you know he is not averse to a little horsewhipping. Joe Camel? Let's not get into the wrongness of fez-wearing dromedaries. The \"smokers are bad\" principle must rank high among the cabinet members of West Lancashire district council who, last week, approved a smoking ban that in effect ends fag breaks for all of its employees. From March, any workers who light up inside or outside council premises will face disciplinary action, which could see them lose their jobs. Such paternalism is often driven by the best intentions. Smoking does kill, so, on many levels, ending my own daily trips out back for a sly puff a year ago was a healthy choice. However, moving beyond my Freudian oral stage has affected both my eyesight and my career. Cigarette breaks for me meant regular hiatuses from gawping at my computer. I was spectacles-free until I started using VDUs a decade ago. Neither of my parents, both non-screen users, wears glasses - ergo, computers have contributed to my shortsightedness. OK, so there is a link between smoking and age-related macular degeneration, which is the leading cause of sight loss in older people, according to a study in the British Journal of Ophthalmology in 2003. But research from Toho University, Japan, in 2004, linked spending long periods of time in front of a computer screenwith an increased risk of glaucoma. Admittedly, I'm clutching at straws here. The College of Optometrists in London says there's no evidence working with a computer screen damages the eyes and that VDUs highlight ocular problems such as shortsightedness. However, fag breaks aid concentration, an increasingly rare commodity in this age of dwindling attention spans. Working solidly throughout the day is untenable. The average person can only keep his or her mind on one thing for six to 11 seconds at a time, while research at the University of Alaska found that average concentration span while reading a textbook for both students and professors was 16 minutes. Humans seem to be designed to operate in short bursts, and for men, that includes coitus. Regular work abstinence of 10 minutes can only help productivity. And if you choose to smoke during those breaks, the nicotine, which is a stimulant, may boost your alertness for the next 16 minutes. That is why you will now find me standing downwind from anyone smoking at the bus stop before going to work. As I was able to give up smoking, some of my colleagues suspect that all those fag breaks I used to take were just skives. Racked with the guilt of an amateur workshy fop, I reach for a solution: volunteer for every tea and coffee run. This does not appeal to the social harpy in me. One in five UK workers views coffee breaks at work as a good way of making friends, according to a survey by the British Coffee Association last month. And 13% of employees see liquid breaks as an opportunity to network. But for the truly ambitious, the fag break is superior to coffee or tea breaks. Smokers have been shown the back door at work. Pariah status creates a camaraderie among those cast from Eden. This transcends rank. Sparking up a conversation with someone far more senior is no longer sullied by the sycophancy of most networking situations. No one should have to put up with smoking. But there are risks in life, and without taking a few, we may never feel the elation that every smoker feels when he or she draws in the first puff of the day. matt.keating@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
