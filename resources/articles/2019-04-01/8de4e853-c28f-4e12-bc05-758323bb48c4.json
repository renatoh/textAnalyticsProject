The 28-year-old Australian citizen, who lives in Sydney, has never met his 18-month-old son, who has been trapped in China with Sam\u2019s wife, Gulyar,* since she returned there while four months\u2019 pregnant. Gulyar is a Chinese citizen and, like Sam, a member of the persecuted Uighur ethnic minority. She is one of three mothers who the Guardian can reveal are stuck in China with their Australian children due to Beijing\u2019s sweeping crackdown on the Uighur, which has left at least one million Muslims in detention centres across the far-western region of Xinjiang. Gulyar has to report to police every week. It is not safe for her to call Sam, as Uighurs say they can be arrested for communication with people outside China, so she is limited to posting photos or videos, no longer than 15 seconds, on WeChat, the Chinese social networking app. Sitting at a Sydney cafe, Sam pulls out his phone and and finds Gulyar has posted a new video. He opens it, watches as his son, a big-cheeked toddler in a green and yellow romper, pulls himself up on a couch and smiles at his mother who chats to him from behind the camera. Sam saves it, hits the heart button underneath so that Gulyar knows he has seen it, and then, 10,000km away, Gulyar deletes the video. Sam\u2019s phone is full of these precious, fleeting, 15-second glimpses of the son he has never met. \u201cEverything is my favourite, whatever she puts up,\u201d he says. But the videos are also a source of pain. \u201cI couldn\u2019t hold him. I don\u2019t even know how heavy he is. Maybe he doesn\u2019t even know who I am,\u201d Sam says. Australian visa rejected Gulyar and Sam married in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, in 2016. They went on a honeymoon to the US and Turkey, where they discovered she was pregnant. \u201cI was so excited, but a bit nervous as well, it was a really good feeling,\u201d Sam says. Gulyar applied for a visa to come to Australia, but it was rejected. Very sick with her pregnancy, she decided to go back to China to be near her mother, while Sam returned to Australia and continued the visa application process. Shortly after she returned home, persecution of Uighurs in Xinjiang intensified. Gulyar\u2019s passport was confiscated and Sam has been unable to get a visa to visit China. When his son was six months old, Sam was on a train in Sydney when he got a message from a friend in China, telling him Gulyar had been taken into one of the notorious and secretive detention centres. \u201cI cried so much on the train, that feeling\u2026\u201d he trails off. \u201cEven people on the train come to me and said, \u2018what\u2019s happened?\u2019 and I can\u2019t tell them.\u201d He didn\u2019t hear from her for two weeks. Eventually, Sam learnt Gulyar had been detained by the Chinese authorities and later released because she was still breastfeeding. Gulyar says the authorities told her that when their baby turned one she would be arrested again and their son put into a state-run orphanage and then adopted out to a Han Chinese family. Sam says it is only the fact that her family have been paying bribes to police totalling more than 60,000 RMB (AU$12,500) that has kept her out of the camps. The Chinese embassy in Australia was repeatedly contacted for comment but did not reply to detailed questions from the Guardian. Sam has repeatedly sought help from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Dfat) to bring his son to Australia. He was initially informed the Australian government could not help him until there was proof his son had Australian citizenship \u2013 something he is entitled to by descent. The Department of Home Affairs has twice rejected the citizenship application. After an 11-month battle, Sam\u2019s son was finally issued a citizenship certificate in February, after the Administrative Appeals Tribunal overturned the department\u2019s decision. \u201cIt\u2019s been like pulling teeth every step of the way,\u201d says Michael Bradley from Marque Lawyers in Sydney, which represents Sam. \u201cIt\u2019s been horrendous.\u201d Now, Sam faces a battle to get a passport for his son and a visa for his wife, who will also need permission from the Chinese government to leave the country. \u201cSo it\u2019s not a simple matter and I don\u2019t know what the answer to that will be,\u201d Bradley says. But he believes that if the Australian government wanted to help, there is a lot it could do. \u201cMinisterial intervention can achieve anything in a matter of minutes. If you\u2019re a French au pair for example, then anything can be achieved \u2026 Ministers have immense power and discretion to make things happen or not, but they simply haven\u2019t been interested.\u201d The Greens spokesman for immigration and citizenship, Nick McKim, who has been advocating for Sam\u2019s family for the past year, agrees. \u201cI still have grave fears for the safety of Sam\u2019s child, who is now an Australian citizen. I want to see Marise Payne and Dfat do a lot more to help bring not only Sam\u2019s child but also his wife to safety here in Australia,\u201d he says. \u201cGiven we\u2019re consistently told by the government that they have a strong relationship with China, I do believe that there\u2019s a lot more that we can do.\u201d In a statement, a spokesperson for Dfat said it had made inquiries about a number of individuals with connections to the Uighur-Australian community, but would not comment on specific cases. The toll on Sam has been huge. Suffering from depression, he was forced to quit his job as a truck driver and now drives for Uber part-time. The money he earns is just enough for him to get by. \u201cHe is an absolute shell of a person compared to the guy I met 11 months ago,\u201d says Sarah Smith, a refugee advocate. \u201cHe was this young, fit, healthy, tanned man, now he has lost 10kg, he looks unwell, he looks ghost-like.\u201d As well as the pain of separation and fear for his family\u2019s safety, Sam has also lost faith in Australia. \u201cThat piece of paper saying \u2018Australian citizen\u2019, in the end, if you don\u2019t have blue eyes and yellow hair it doesn\u2019t really work,\u201d Sam says. But he says he does, occasionally, permit himself to hope and when he does, he pictures a very particular scene. \u201cI\u2019m in the airport, I bring flowers,\u201d he says smiling. \u201cAfter what I\u2019ve been going through, I don\u2019t care if I sleep outside, as long as my wife and my son are with me. I\u2019m not really thinking about having a good life, a wonderful life, all I\u2019m thinking is to stay with my son and wife.\u201d *Names have been changed"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
