And if you do join anyone's group and you change your mind, remember you don't have to continue to be a member. Katie, 19. During freshers' week, you've just got your loan and everyone wants a piece of it, so be wise. Don't get conned into paying for \"special\" events that actually happen every week. Nadia, 18. For making mates, be outgoing and forget what people thought you were like at school. You can be your true self now. Forget the old stereotypes. Emma, 19. Get a bus pass now. It's so much easier to get a bus back from Asda than having to lug all those bags. James, 19. Don't forget the student union is not the only place you can go to have a drink or go out and have fun - discover other clubs and pubs. Tom, 18. Freshers' week is when you spend loads of money, and don't remember most of it. Just remember to have fun, and not to regret anything you did. John, 20. Look around for the societies that you're interested in - they really are a good way to meet new people and enjoy yourself. Theresa, 18. It shouldn't be too hard to make new friends: everyone's in the same boat. Don't be fooled by people who don't seem to care that they're away from home for the first time. Simon, 19. You won't get time to miss anyone at home during freshers' week: it's probably the busiest and maddest part of your first year. Kate, 19. I know everyone spends loads of money in freshers' week, but don't if you can't afford it. It's so easy to get yourself into debt in your first week at uni.
