I don't think so. To my mind anyone who insinuates that an athlete is on drugs is wrongly damaging the sport. Take the 16-year-old Chinese swimmer Ye Shiwen, whose gold medal-winning performance was questioned by the American coach John Leonard. I thought what he said was disgusting. He ruined her moment of glory and forever after she will be tainted by his words. Similar insinuations were made, albeit more subtly, about the Algerian runner Taoufik Makhloufi, who won 1500m gold at these Games, and F\u00e9lix S\u00e1nchez, who won the 400m hurdles at the age of 34. We seem to have got to the point where an athlete puts in a brilliant performance and the response is scepticism. If people within the sport or in the media are saying these things, then what on earth are the punters in the pub supposed to think? I get sick to death explaining to people on the street that the sport is the cleanest it has ever been. I know from my own career that what seems from the outside to be a dramatic improvement is often just hours of hard graft behind the scenes. Early on in my career I went from 7,400 points to 8,300 points in one decathlon. On paper that is a leap of 900 points but that progress took place slowly over the course of two years. I am so tired of talking to people who have no clue and think everyone is on drugs; it is just not the case. In the instance of Makhloufi, yes, his final lap was something special but his overall winning time was not out of this world. What surprised me more was the fact that the two Kenyans finished last and second-last in the race and that the favourites for the title never showed up. With regards to Makhloufi's mysterious knee injury clearing up in time for the 1500m final, I think we all know what happened there. Makhloufi had made it known that he did not want to compete in the 800m but, due to an administrative error on the part of his federation, he was not withdrawn from the heats. When he was then forced to compete he dropped out of the race early on, only to be thrown out of the Games for not trying hard enough. Makhloufi then went to a doctor complaining of a 'knee injury' and was given some treatment by a man with let's call them magic hands and, before you know it, he was fit and raring to go. I am not saying that is a good way to go about things but he played by the rules as closely as he possibly could. It is not far off what the British cyclist Philip Hindes did in working the system. Should an athlete be punished for an administrative error? I don't think so. Look at the case of Valerie Adams, the 2008 Olympic shot put champion from New Zealand whose federation had completed entry forms for the Games incorrectly and were forced to plead with the IOC for her to be allowed to compete. In such instances it should be the federation which is punished, not the athlete. Question marks were also raised over the performance of S\u00e1nchez in winning the 400m hurdles final. But this is a guy with two world titles and an Olympic title who has been on the grand prix circuit for years. To my mind anyone who questions his performance does not deserve to be involved in the sport. What I will not tolerate are athletes who have been banned for doping and then are allowed back into the sport \u2013 twice in the case of Justin Gatlin. When he won the bronze medal in the 100m on Sunday night I felt sick to the stomach. To watch Tyson Gay \u2013 one of the greatest sprinters of all time \u2013 walking through the mixed zone in floods of tears, knowing that he was deprived of that bronze medal, I just wanted to put my arm around him and say: \"Mate, we all feel the same. We think you were robbed by someone who should never have been allowed at these Games.\" Gatlin protests his innocence while the American 400m runner LaShawn Merritt says he took a penis enhancement product. Should have married someone with smaller hands, I say. We are almost at the end of the Olympic period and so far there have been no major drug scandals. If things stay that way, these could be the cleanest Olympics in history. That would be a fitting tribute to how strongly Great Britain feels about this issue and how stringent a system we have in place for catching drugs cheats."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
