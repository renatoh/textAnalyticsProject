England's three matches against the major southern hemisphere nations start with the All Blacks on November 9, and Woodward says he will choose his strongest side for the fixture. There has been speculation that Woodward will choose Charlie Hodgson at fly-half and move Jonny Wilkinson to inside-centre, and it is probable that, if the Bristol prop Julian White had not been suspended for the next eight weeks, he would have played at tight-head with Phil Vickery at loose-head. \"There will be a lot of conjecture about the make-up of the team,\" said Woodward. \"All I will say is that it will be the best we can field. I do not believe in experimenting to see if something will pay off, but I am a big believer in hunches and the difference is that in the latter case you expect a selection to pay off rather than just hope. I am disappointed Julian is not going to be involved. I am a big admirer of the guy but he let himself and his team down. \"I am very happy with the way the England side is moving forward, but we are still behind New Zealand and Australia. They have both won a World Cup and, until we do the same, we cannot say we are ahead of them. This is a huge year for us because we play the All Blacks and the Wallabies twice before the World Cup and nothing is being left to chance.\" It will be the first World Cup played in the summer and Woodward, who lived in Australia for five years, knows it will be different. \"It will be the same for every team, but we will be playing France in Marseille next August and will then spend 10 days in a training camp in the south of France, where it will be hot, before flying out to Perth. \"Our World Cup matches will not be kicking off until eight in the evening, which means the temperature will not be at its hottest, but they will still be conditions we are not used to and that is why we have been painstaking in drawing up our programme in the year leading up to the tournament. \"I had not been around long enough before the 1999 World Cup to make sure that our preparation was spot-on and we ended up playing mismatches against teams which had been cobbled together before the start of the tournament. This time, we face Australia and New Zealand next summer before playing two matches against France and one against Wales.\" Woodward does not believe his players will be burned out. \"The big thing is that they had a long off-season this summer,\" he said. \"The difference it has made with Martin Johnson is incredible. He was so tired last season that he could barely run in matches by the end of it, which is why I left him out of our final Six Nations game against Italy. \"Martin will captain England this season if he is worth his place in the side and he is as fit as I have ever seen him. The Premiership season winds up at the end of May and we are then Down Under for three weeks. The players will have five weeks off when they return before we prepare for France and Wales. \"Key players like Martin and Jonny will play against either Australia or New Zealand and in one or two of the August matches. I have no fears about burn-out: my concern is making sure we got our selection right and that will mean whittling the 36 players who will be involved in the five matches next summer down to 30. \"We do have strength in depth, but there is a difference between someone who is good enough to play for a winning England team and a world-class player. We need more of the latter. There is no one position I am more concerned about than any other and, in some cases, second row for instance, we have six or seven players pushing hard. Garath Archer is back to form for Bristol and I have spoken to him. \"My immediate priority is the autumn internationals and our next four matches, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa and France are against the top countries in the world. Statistics show that no side has conceded fewer tries in their last 10 matches than England and we are a side which can defend and attack. Everyone goes on about us winning the Six Nations grand slam, but our aim is to become the best side in the world, and that is what the next year is about.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
