I knew he was bisexual, but he only wanted a relationship with a woman. I have always tried to please him. My issue is that now our sex always seems to involve him dressing up to \u201cfeel like a woman\u201d. I feel as if he doesn\u2019t want to be my man sexually. Although he tells me I turn him on more than anyone, I worry that I am not enough. He says this upsets him and this is why he did not want to open up about it. I\u2019m so confused. While many men who enjoy dressing in female clothing for erotic purposes are heterosexual, it can leave the woman confused and resentful. A common theory is that such a man might have connected the feel of feminine lingerie with sexual interest early in life (for example, as a boy trying on an older sister\u2019s clothing) and they may find the experience comforting or arousing. Although this interest is not unusual, it is common for adult males to hide it from their partners, fearing it will not be acceptable. You, though, seem to be accepting and understanding, and that is a blessing for you both. But it is important that you, too, get your needs met, to make your sex life together fairer. Explain that you need more balance in your erotic sessions and negotiate terms to create that. Some couples agree on 50/50 (cross-dressing session/love-making the way the woman wants). Your husband has shared an important part of himself with you, but now it is encroaching too much. Assuage the resentment you are harbouring by insisting on a better deal. \u2022 Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders. \u2022 If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to private.lives@theguardian.com (please don\u2019t send attachments).
