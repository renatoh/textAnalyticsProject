The young man, who had already spent time in a young offender institution, and had turned to Poyton to try to turn his life around, said the short walk from the local estate was extremely dangerous. \u201cThis was a person who had been written off as an angry young man by a lot of society, and professionals, and actually he was a scared child,\u201d says Poyton, now chief executive of the youth charity, Redthread. It was this awareness that young, at-risk people can experience many barriers to accessing healthcare, counselling and other forms of support that has driven Poyton, 45, in his career in youth work. Inspired by his own teenage years working on church residential summer camps for children in the UK, Poyton became a professional youth worker after stints at a local benefits office and assisting in a school. His mother, a nurse, and father, a lay minister, also instilled in him an interest in \u201chumanity and society\u201d. His \u201cepiphany moment\u201d came, he says, when he joined Redthread in 2002 and set up a young people\u2019s drop-in health clinic at a GP practice. \u201cI questioned how easy it was going to be to do good relational youth work in a health context \u2026 it sounded like it was going to be a bit clinical,\u201d he says, explaining that he shared a consulting room with the local midwives. But he was soon convinced that the drop-in clinic was, in fact, the perfect place to reach and help the most difficult-to-engage young people with both their health and wider problems such as involvement in violence or teenage pregnancy. \u201cThey might present about their spots but actually there was a conversation there about their self-harm or their substance misuse.\u201d Redthread was established in 1995 by churchgoers in Dulwich, south London. In 2009, Poyton was appointed to lead the organisation, and, between 2014 and 2018, it grew from 10 members of staff and a turnover of \u00a3150,000 to 60 staff and a turnover of \u00a31.5m. The charity now helps more than 2,000 young people a year, and is best known for its unique work embedding youth workers in hospital major trauma centres and emergency departments where they support young people who have been victims of violence. Figures provided by around half of English hospitals showed that more than 4,500 11- to 25-year-olds attended A&amp;E in 2018 after an assault by a knife or other weapon. Redthread believes that targeting difficult-to-engage young people at a point of crisis in their lives \u2013 when they have been seriously injured provides a \u201cteachable moment\u201d when they are most likely to be receptive to advice and support. Its own evaluation of its youth violence intervention programme (YVIP) in 2017-18, found that 57% of young people had reduced involvement with violence after working with the charity. The YVIP now operates across three of the capital\u2019s major trauma centre hospitals; an A&amp;E in Hackney, east London; and it commissions the St Giles Trust charity to deliver a similar scheme at the Royal London hospital. And a three-year pilot, supported by the government\u2019s serious violence strategy, is bringing the model to three hospitals in Birmingham and Nottingham. Yet Poyton is keen to stress that \u201cviolence is a health issue\u201d. He describes Redthread as a health charity, not a \u201cgangs, violence and knife crime organisation\u201d. \u201cThe reason we\u2019ve scaled the work around violence is because violence is a health issue that doesn\u2019t already have other referral pathwaysor other support mechanisms in place,\u201d he says. Asked what he thinks of the government\u2019s strategy to tackle serious violence, Poyton replies: \u201cThe criminal justice system or the policing system has recognised for quite some time that they can\u2019t arrest their way out of the problem \u2026 that actually this is not just about gangs and criminality, it\u2019s about safeguarding the vulnerable,\u201d he says. He welcomes the pledge from the home secretary, Sajid Javid, to follow the successful Scottish approach that treats serious violence as primarily a public health issue, not a crime, as he thinks it will help to break down funding silos between the NHS, the police and other services. \u201cIt\u2019s a good framework as it brings people together to think outside of the box,\u201d he says. Poyton wants Redthread\u2019s YVIP model to be in GP practices, A&amp;Es and all of England\u2019s major trauma centres. \u201cWe ought to be meeting that young person the first time they come through the emergency department,\u201d he says. Although he believes the NHS is \u201camazing\u201d, he feels young people are being let down by it. Because medical training is focused on babies, children and adults, adolescents, he says, have specific needs that are not being met. Redthread runs an adolescent outreach service from King\u2019s College hospital in south-east London, which aims to improve the care of teenagers in hospital. Poyton says: \u201cAn awful lot more work done needs to be done to create equity in the health system for young people.\u201d Curriculum vitae Age: 45. Lives: South London.
