In their pre-disco days, Robin always had his hand cupped over his ear and, with his spaniel hair, cut a wan figure on stage. Barry could soften his voice, go gooey and breathy on a song like Words, but Robin's voice was loud, quavering and intense. It sounded unhappy; it sounded like no one else before or since. I've always been drawn to pop's unlikely outsiders, ones who make a mark without resorting to any of the usual rock'n'roll behaviour, whether they be Del Shannon or Vic Godard or Adam Ant, and Robin Gibb fits the bill perfectly. There's the childhood story about him picking up the fire bug. Aged eight he became a part-time pyromaniac, and quickly progressed from bedclothes to advertising hoardings. One day a member of the Manchester constabulary came knocking and gently suggested the family should consider emigrating. Manchester's problem became Australia's, but Robin started to channel his pyro activities into vocal harmonies \u2013 with no New York subway stations available, the brothers practised their art in public conveniences. While Barry Gibb was the pin-up, and the group's leonine leader, Robin struggled to assert himself, even though he was as prolific a writer as his big brother. The Bee Gees' manager Robert Stigwood, he felt, favoured his prettier older brother when it came to A-sides. He was also dogged by incredibly bad fortune. In 1968 he was returning to London from Hastings with his fiancee Molly when the train carriage they were in came off the rails just outside Catford. The Hither Green train disaster killed 49 people. The desolate Really and Sincerely (\"My mind is open wide/ I'm on the other side\") was the first song Robin wrote after the crash. Robin and Molly married a few months later. Honeymooning in the Alps, in a tiny cabin, they were snowed in by an avalanche and weren't discovered until four days later. From this point on, he was always more likely to write an elegy \u2013 like 1970's Sincere Relation \u2013 than Jive Talking. At least Robin's perceived second-billing was subtly avenged over time \u2013 Barry never had a sizeable solo hit, but Robin had a huge European hit with the Dickensian angst of Saved by the Bell (a UK No 2 in 1969) during a brief split from his brothers. In the early 80s, when the Bee Gees brand was almost unmarketable in a post-disco world, he pulled it off again with Juliet, a melancholy slice of upbeat electropop that again hit top 10s everywhere in Europe apart from Britain, reaching No 1 in Germany. While Barry has always kept the Gibb family unit tight, with brothers, spouses and parents all living within walking distance of each other in Miami, Robin has always rebelled. So when Barry and Maurice were making the hapless TV comedy Cucumber Castle in 1969, Robin set out to show he was the group's renaissance man. He may have seemed a delicate flower on stage but he didn't lack for ambition. That summer the NME reported that he had \"completed a book called On the Other Hand which is to be published soon \u2026 I'm a great admirer of Dickens.\" In the few weeks between leaving the Bee Gees and hitting the chart with Saved by the Bell he wrote more than 100 songs. \"I'm also doing the musical score for a film called Henry the Eighth,\" he told Fabulous, \"and I'm making my own film called Family Tree. It involves a man, John Family, whose grandfather is caught trying to blow up Trafalgar Square with a homemade bomb wrapped in underwear.\" In July 1969 the NME announced Robin was \"fronting a 97-piece orchestra and a 60-piece choir in a recording of his latest composition To Heaven and Back, which was inspired by the Apollo 11 moonshot. It is an entirely instrumental piece, with the choir being used for 'astral effects'.\" Robin Gibb was still only 19 years old. He was also obsessed with British history. In 1984 he bought a 12th century house called The Prebendal in Thame, Oxfordshire; while Barry and Maurice seemed more at home sunning themselves in Miami, their brother was proud to tell visitors that Elizabeth I and Henry VIII had both strolled around his dark, oak-lined home. Age barely mellowed his eccentricity. In the 90s he left his brothers speechless when, during an interview with all three of them on Howard Stern's show, he announced his wife Dwina was bisexual and they enjoyed threesomes. He quickly said it was a joke, then changed his mind again a week later. With their cocooned, peripatetic upbringing (Isle Of Man, Manchester, Australia), the Gibbs never had an instinct for cool pop moves. And Robin Gibb's music - untutored and isolated (I can picture most of it being written on a harpsichord in a dimly lit 12th century living room) \u2013 has come out without any of the usual dulling rock'n'roll filters. Who else could have written Odessa (City on the Black Sea) about a man stranded on an iceberg, writing a letter to his wife who loves \"that vicar more than words can say\"? Frankly, no one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
