The US scored early and never looked in much trouble \u2014 even when Honduras got one back early in the second half. The USA went straight up to the other end to make it 3-1 and the game was pretty much over as a contest from there. There were few negative points for the victors, but the two there were were potentially significant. First, the set piece defending is still poor and you'd expect either of their prospective opponents in the final to punish them. Secondly, the sending off of Klinsmann was a needless distraction and as the absolute face of this USA operation, his absence on the bench will be a big loss in the final. (EDIT: Just hearing that the touchline ban isn't automatic, so the concacaf disciplinary committee will decide whether Klinsmann can sit on the bench on Sunday). For now though, the US can concentrate on preparing for Sunday's final knowing that their upwards trajectory continues apace, even against what were meant to be difficult opponents. We'll have live coverage of that one. Hope you'll join us. Thanks to those who tweeted and emailed tonight. For now, good night. USA are in the final! Final thoughts in a moment. Johnson picks up a yellow for standing too close to a free kick. Now Honduras have another free kick in a dangerous spot to the left corner of the box, but Chavez sends a nothing ball straight to Rimando, and that will be that. Donovan sitting on the turf at the side of the field, with an ice pack on his leg. We know this because the camera operator doesn't have the option of panning to Klinsmann right now. US pinging the ball around up the right of the field, finding space on the narrow field to run the clock down. That was probably the first foot wrong from Klinsmann all tournament \u2014 he should have known that was always likely when he bawled out the referee. His bench are all on their feet now barking awkwardly at the US players, trying to fill a big Germanic power vacuum. We'll have three minutes of added time. Klinsmann is on his feet, furious, after Beasley is fouled just in front of him. And the referee sends him to the stands for his shouted protests. He'll have to watch the final from the stands. That's an unnecessary distraction for that game. Rimando is barged by Martinez in what looked like a foul born of frustration. The ball is cleared long and Wondolowski is almost clean through in the box. He stays on his feet honestly as he's pulled back by Beckeles, and manages to force a cut back from the byline, but can't find a fellow US player. First real chance for him. Palacios kicks Beasley near the halfway line and he takes his time getting to his feet. All the subs are on though. Now Shea gets some space to run at Media down the left, but his cutback and corss can't find a red and white shirt and Honduras clear. But now they must face an inswinger from the left as Beasley is clattered again. Diskerud sends it in and then, when the ball is headed clear, Holden sets himself for the shot which wings its way past the post. Najar cuts inside and tries to find Palacios with a nice cross. It's cleared, but a decent flick back into the box finds Palacios for the first time shot, which deflects off Besler's foot. Better from Honduras, who also force Rimando to get down sharply to smother a cross in the next move. US just need to concentrate to make sure there isn't a nervy ending to this game. So we reach ten minutes to go and it's still USA 3-1 Honduras with little sign of that changing immediately. Shea holds the ball up well to keep the US passing going but now Honduras force a turnover, though their struggles to match the US first time passing is evident as they concede possession sloppily when they try to build. Ball bobbles dangerously in the Honduras box and eventually arrives to Johnson from a nice cutback from the lively Bedoya. but the Seattle man's shot skims just past the far post. Great chance for 4-1. Shea rolls his eyes as he harries Media for the ball and the Honduras player goes over to claim the free kick. Now Shea is showing more facial expressions as he's clattered from behind by Chavez. He gets to his field wincing. Next up: Bitchy Resting Face. Honduras try to apply a little pressure and Bedoya is a little too elaborate in trying to play out of trouble in his own box, but the US begin to push up and push Honduras back. Honduras put a nice little passing spell together though, on the edge of the US box, but can't quite force a clear shooting chance as the US regroup. Shea's in for Torres by the way. A little scare for the US as Rimando rushes out of his goal and has to show some neat footwork on the edge of the box to keep out of trouble. Just a reminder to the US that there's still a quarter of this game to go. And we're going to see Wondolowski coming on for Donovan. Can he prove a point? Huge cheer for Donovan as he departs. Diskerud coming in for Beckerman, who's been solid tonight. It's still USA 3-1 Honduras with 20 minutes to go Honduras still trying to spring an unimpressed US backline with long balls, but no more joy in the 66th minute than the 6th minute. Now Torres picks up a rather soft looking yellow. The US have a free kick wide right after Johnson is fouled. Honduras get the inswinger clear but only to the US midfield who surge forward again. But Beckerman overruns the ball down the left and that'll be a goal kick. A poor through ball intended for Rojas is scooped up by Rimando. The US subs are beginning to warm up now, to see this game through. Holden's on his feet and wanders to the sidelines. You wonder how long Klinsmann might want to keep the midfielder on, given this surface. Johnson and Chavez in the wars again in the center circle as the striker tries to hold the ball up and ends up fouling his marker. Honduras finally beginning to push a few men forward but still restricting themselves to long shots \u2014 Delgado sends one flying wide, watched comfortably past the post by Rimando. Torres lofts the ball up from the corner of the box, but he can't get his chip to come back down again and that's rather a wasted chance from a decent free kick position near the corner of the box. Johnson and Chavez battling for the ball down the left and the latter crashes the former into the hoardings. Elsewhere on the field Holden is lying winded after a clash with Palacios. Donovan's numbers are pretty crazy right now. And he just delivered what should be a telling blow against Honduras. Now Chavez is penalized for handball right on the edge of the box and Honduras have to defend again... Well that was a short competitive game. Another long ball from Goodson, another touch inside from Bedoya and the simplest of tap-ins for Donovan! So far so good for the US in the just-this-side-of-half-time mini game, but now Beasley brings down Palacios wide right and they can test the defense from the free kick... Sure enough, the USA lose Media from the free kick and he meets the inswinger with a header past Rimando! From nowhere, game back on! So much for the El Salvador-style start to the second half, so far at least. Honduras starting as they ended the first - very, very reluctant to commit men forward. Now they have to defend a free kick from Torres, but the US retain possession and Bedoya skips into space on a headed knock on from Johnson down the right and forces a save from Escober. Honduras can't quite clear the corner and the ball is forced back on for another Johnson header, that flies over. Still USA 2-0 Honduras Klinsmann hasn't made any changes, though having shuffled his pack before the game started he has quite a lot of fresh legs out there. He's apparently warned his team about coming out flat as they did against El Salvador and urged them to push for the third goal that should kill this game. We're underway again and Honduras do ring the changes. Chavez in for Reyes. Palacios in for Lopez. So far, it's been awkward rather than horrible, though if I was Juan Carlos Garcia I'd be inclined to blame the field all night long. The left back has had a torrid time so far. Wonder how Chris Wondolowski felt as the Johnson goal went in? Having dropped to the bench he saw his replacement score against tougher opposition than he had faced when assembling his five goals - the principal knock against his haul. Wondo being an essentially decent guy, I'm sure he was happy to see his team mate score. He's also a striker though, so to paraphrase Oscar Wilde, \"Every time a team mate scores, even a tap-in, part of me dies inside.\" Honduras players remain on the field in a huddle as the half-time whistle blows. They need some major re-organization at half-time. They'll take some heart with the trouble El Salvador caused in the opening ten minutes of the quarter final (though perhaps less heart from how the US adjusted to their changes then hit them with some of their own en route to a thrashing). That was about as perfect as the first half could have gone for Klinsmann's team. His new starting striker scored almost immediately, his team looked comfortable in possession and their opponents timid in committing forward, even after Donovan added a second. If they can keep this tight for the opening 15 minutes of the second half it's hard to see Honduras coming back. On the few occasions the USA were at all on the back foot, Holden looked neat in midfield, Beckerman was his usual unflashy self and the back four rarely had much to do. Surely Honduras have to throw on forwards now. But with the shape of the game as it is, it's hard to see even that making a difference \u2014 such is the USA dominance. Half time thoughts in a moment US get a little over cute in midfield and Honduras regain possession, but Lopez sends a rather pointless ball over the top from near the halfway line and Rimando grabs it easily. Half drifting to a close right now. Honduras get a free kick to the left of the field some 35 yards out. Ripe for the inswinger against the one area of US vulnerability so far - defending set pieces. Besler gets to it first to head clear, at the expense of what looks like a boot to the head. Possession reasonably even \u2014 54-46 in favor of US, but the quality and areas of possession should tell a clear story of US dominance, a lot of which is coming down this right hand side. The other (most) salient stat is still USA 2-0 Honduras Goodson tries another long ball over the top for Bedoya, and Garcia can only knock it out for a throw. Parkhurst comes up in support again, and does well to find rare space on the overlap only to shank his cross badly. A minute later Torres has a rather lazy shot from distance that drifts wide. Honduras step up sharply to force a midfield turnover, but can't take advantage and are immediately on the back foot again. Parkhurst steps up from right back for the first time, but his first time pass isn't great as he tries to support the attack and Honduras breathe again. Boos ringing out now as the referee remonstrates with Torres, though in fairness the US man was waving an imaginary card, which never endears players to officials. So just over ten minutes to go to half time - around the time El Salvador got one back in the last game. Can Honduras at least cause the same period of challenge the US went through either side of the half in the quarter final? No sign of it yet, and the next chance falls to Bedoya wide right, whose shot is just charged down. US corner...cleared at the near post. Johnson controls the ball in the corner of the box but goes over under the challenge of Chavez before he can do anything with it. The conditions of the game are perfect for him right now. Honduras can't afford to stay as deep as they have been if they're going to do anything in this game, so Johnson and Donovan will have more space to run into. Another slight note of concern for the US on a set piece as the ball is eventually hit firmly by Reyes straight at Rimando. Almost immediately though Donovan meets another ball from Bedoya, this one from wide right, as the number 10 races to the near post. His first time shot glances off him and runs well wide of the far post though. he should have done better. Half an hour gone and the US looking comfortable at 2-0 Another 17 stat. Donovan's 17th Gold Cup goal! Long ball is met by Bedoya's touch just inside Garcia, who's struggling. It's controlled by Donovan on his chest near the penalty spot and he pokes the ball home. Honduras are in all sorts of trouble now. Grant Wahl on Fox just discussed the number of divots being kicked up and pointed out he wouldn't want to be playing in the second game tonight (Mexico vs Panama). He's also mentioned the unnatural bounce of the ball at times here, though at least so far we haven't had the anticipated problems with players slipping on the temporary surface. Delgado does well to read the ball as the US try to open up the defense with a long diagonal ball. Now Honduras come forward and Rimando has to be off his line to kick an awkward ball clear out wide. That was a decent couple of minutes for Honduras, but they're still not really committing enough players forward to consistently trouble the US and their own defense is sitting dangerously deep. So 20 minutes gone and the USA are dominating here. But a few glimmers for Honduras now. Beckerman cuts out the ball on a rare turnover for Honduras and immediately tries a long ball for Johnson. Escober races out of his goal to claim and sends it upfield. Najar links up play well and Honduras force their first corner from a blocked cross down the right. Johnson blasts it away after slightly nervy defending that gives Chavez the first touch. Still USA 1-0 Honduras The replay of the Holden incident made it look a little worse than the real time view, but the referee was unsighted. US keep pressing in the wake of it and a slip in the box almost allows Johnson in, but the ball is cleared by Beckeles, I think, before he can connect. Now Holden has another shot from distance after Donovan touches the ball inside on the edge of the box. It flies over, but this is all US pressure right now. US force a turnover in the center circle and then when Garcia regains possession Donovan chases him down and forces him to play it off the US man and out for a throw. Honduras being played a little at their own pressing game here. Now Beckerman slips a little ball inside for Holden, who sprints into the box and catches an arm in the face from Garcia and goes down. No decision. Adrian Fussell writes in, with a touch of real-politik analysis: Absolutely shameful playing surface. How did US Soccer let this happen? Oh well, EJ scores / deal-with-it glasses. That was the USA's 17th goal of this tournament, and EJ's 17th international goal. How will Honduras respond? Chalk another one up to Klinsmann's selection decisions! Quick through ball releases Johnson who races through the middle and into the box, where he places a firm shot high into the net. USA free kick curled in by Donovan from deep, but Johnson can't get near it. Few clear chances so far, though the US have shaded the play. Holden has to get across sharply in midfield as Reyes tries to work a give and go though. Still USA 0-0 Honduras. Oh wait... Rimando rolls the ball out and the US begin their build up from the back. Bedoya cuts inside and tries to thread a pass through, but it's cut out. US recover and try some one touch work that goes through Torres, who tees up Holden for a first time shot that flies just wide. Right idea. US beginning to try and settle on the ball and a long ball is sent forward for Johnson, whose cut back looks like it's going nowhere, until Garcia makes rather a hash of clearing it over his shoulder and almost handles. Honduras harrying the US whenever they have the ball. It's going pretty much as we expected \u2014 and this narrow field is keeping space at a premium for the US attack. They'll have to work quickly. Field is pretty narrow, which may suit Honduras. Or narrow field fetishists. Ball passed back to Rimando for his first touch. Speaking of first touches - already this surface is looking like it's going to make those a rarity. This could be aesthetically trying. US try to work their first build up and Torres wriggles free on the left to send a low ball in towards Johnson, but it's cut out. Immediately a ball goes away on the surface and the US almost pounce through Johnson, but Honduras force it clear. Now Bedoya pushes a ball in from wide right towards Johnson, but he's adjudged to have fouled as he battles for the ball outside the box. Had you going there. It's actually Honduras that kick off. And on that tactical bombshell we're underway... Formalities taking place...oh hang on, heeeeeeeeere's Twitter... Takes a lot more than being ignored in favor of grouting to annoy me. US about to kick off... Honduras anthem bobs along at a stately pace, then we pan along the US team as the US anthem plays. Can report that Kyle Beckerman is doing the \"I think I left the gas on\" face, and Eddie Johnson looks rather sweet beside him, singing his heart out. We'll be underway imminently. USA: Rimando; Parkhurst, Besler, Goodson, Beasley (c); Beckerman, Holden; Bedoya, Donovan, Torres; Johnson Honduras: Escober; Chavez, Media, Beckeles, Garcia; Delgado, Najar, Reyes, L\u00f3pez, Claros; Rojas So a few interesting changes there. Holden gets Diskerud\u2019s spot in the midfield, and Bedoya is in for Corona, while most notably Eddie Johnson gets a start up front after his impact off the bench in the last game. Wondolowski drops to the bench. Same back line, with no room for Gonzalez, though let's not read too much into that... For Honduras, MLS fans might want to keep an eye on Claros, the midfielder who's reportedly interesting Sporting KC. He'll be playing in the center of midfield in a 4-1-4-1 Going into tonight\u2019s games Chris Wondolowski is tied with Panama\u2019s Gabriel Torres as lead goalscorer for the tournament, with the five he plundered in the opening two games. And there\u2019s the rub for Wondolowski. He really could do with getting another one at least against slightly more proven opposition to complete the international rehabilitation job started over the last few weeks. But as you\u2019ll see in a moment when I put the teams up, he\u2019ll have to do that off the bench in this game. ...or words to that effect (and with apologies to Brian Clough). We're at the home of the Dallas Cowboys. We\u2019re expecting a big crowd tonight for the double-header of the semi-finals. So far so good. But the temporary field has already been a big cause for concern for all those who've seen it. Jurgen Klinsmann was pictured crinkling his nose up at what\u2019s reportedly a rock hard temporary surface, and temporary US goalkeeping coach Brad Friedel claimed that the surface felt like concrete \u2014 hardly surprising perhaps, since the thin layer of grass was laid on concrete... Not that the US aren\u2019t used to it. In this age of soccer-specific stadiums, the national team have still ended up playing on temporary surfaces in NFL stadiums three times in the last six weeks, and by the time Klinsmann spoke to reporters about it, he was, publicly at least, fairly sanguine about the grass, trotting out the \u201cboth teams have to play on it\u201d line. Whether Nick Rimando fancies doing double saves on it is another matter... Since their Olympic heroics last year, Honduras have rather struggled \u2014 looking a little disjointed in some of their recent World Cup outings. They\u2019ve somewhat gone back to basics in their Gold Cup run, never committing more than a few players forward and pressing opponents in midfield, so this may be a little like the Costa Rica game for the US. In fact, Honduras beat Costa Rica in the quarter finals, thanks to Andy Najar (formerly of D.C. United) scoring his first international goal. Though another MLS connection played a big part in that game \u2014 Real Salt Lake\u2019s Alvaro Saborio missed a couple of absolute sitters, including one in the second minute, that would have put Costa Rica ahead. As it is the Ticos went home and the Catrachos are in this evening\u2019s semi. Like many of the teams at the Gold Cup, Honduras are without some of their key first choice players \u2014 in their case, Roger Espinoza and Victor Bernardez are particularly big losses. Honduras do have six players who played in that recent tight game against the US though, so this is a tough enough assignment for Klinsmann\u2019s men. That said, the two teams have swapped victories in their last four meetings and if that pattern holds, Honduras will win tonight... This has been a big tournament for several players in the US squad, though after a couple of games without scoring (after scoring five in the opening two), a little of the buzz around Chris Wondolowski has cooled. The emphasis has shifted to Landon Donovan, who has led by example throughout. Five goals and seven assists since his return to the team tells its own story. Donovan\u2019s The USA reached the Gold Cup semifinal after a dominating 5-1 win over El Salvador, though it wasn\u2019t until the middle of the second half that they truly opened up, after El Salvador had pulled back from 2-0 down just before half-time. The highlights of that one are below \u2014 and while some of the US goals are impressive, there\u2019s also a rather special Panenka from El Salvador\u2019s Zelaya, who did a fine job of putting himself in the shop window. If the US win tonight they\u2019ll have won their last ten games to extend what\u2019s already a team record. And they'll make their fifth consecutive Gold Cup final. Welcome to the Gold Cup semi-final between USA and Honduras. You know the drill by now \u2014 this is one tournament where the USA get to enjoy big boy status, so their games tend to be an exercise in trying to unlock stubborn defenses just itching to catch them on the counter. So far though, while giving up goals to the combined might of Belize, Cuba and El Salvador, the US have found the perfect antidote to that being a problem - score a gazillion at the other end. In fact the only team not to score against the USA in this tournament so far, Costa Rica, came away with a respectable 1-0 defeat that was easily the closest margin of defeat against a USA team that has outscored their opponents in this tournament 16-3. Extrapolating from that, Honduras might be well-advised to consider the tactic of not scoring this evening... These two teams know each other well of course, though perhaps not the exact personnel each country is fielding in this competition. The two 'A' teams played out a rather grim game in Utah just last month, that saw Jozy Altidore get the game-winner that all but guaranteed US participation in the Brazil World Cup, while of course the US opened their World Cup Hexagonal group campaign with a loss to the same opponents at the start of the year. Honduras have been in some disarray since then, but they're still a dangerous team. We'll be underway pretty soon, but I'll be back with some more build up and team news in the meantime, so keep this page open while you're putting the final touches to the decor for your Honduran-theme party, and send me your tweets to @KidWeil and emails to graham.parker.freelance@guardiannews.com \u2014 and while you do that you can watch what happened when these two teams last met:"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
