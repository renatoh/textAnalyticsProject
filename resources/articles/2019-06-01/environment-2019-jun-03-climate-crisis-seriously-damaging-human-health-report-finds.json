Scorching heatwaves and floods will claim more victims as extreme weather increases but there are serious indirect effects too, from spreading mosquito-borne diseases to worsening mental health. \u201cThere are impacts occurring now [and], over the coming century, climate change has to be ranked as one of the most serious threats to health,\u201d said Prof Sir Andrew Haines, a co-chair of the report for the European Academies\u2019 Science Advisory Council (Easac). However, there were also great benefits from action to cut carbon emissions, the report found, most notably cutting the 350,000 early deaths from air pollution every year in Europe caused by burning fossil fuels. \u201cThe economic benefits of action to address the current and prospective health effects of climate change are likely to be substantial,\u201d the report concluded. The World Health Organization director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, warned in November that climate breakdown was already a health crisis. \u201cWe cannot delay action on climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot sleepwalk through this health emergency any longer.\u201d In December, a WHO report said tackling the climate crisis would save at least a million lives a year, making it a moral imperative to act. The new Easeac report, The Imperative of Climate Action to Protect Human Health in Europe, assessed the scientific evidence of the effects of global heating on health. Extreme weather such as heatwaves, floods and droughts have direct short-term impacts but also affect people in the longer term. \u201cMental health effects include post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, substance abuse and depression,\u201d the report said. The scientists were also concerned by the effect of extreme weather on food production, with studies showing a 5-25% cut in staple crop yields across the Mediterranean region in coming decades. But the report said even small cuts in meat eating could lead to significant cuts in carbon emissions, as well as benefits to health. The report anticipates the spread of infectious diseases in Europe as temperatures rise and increase the range of mosquitoes that transmit dengue fever and ticks that cause Lyme disease. Food poisoning could also rise, as salmonella bacteria thrived in warmer conditions, the report said. It even found research suggesting antibiotic resistance in E coli increases in hotter conditions. \u201cWe are exposing the whole of the world population to changes in climate, and this is clearly very concerning as we are moving to some extent into uncharted territory,\u201d said Haines, professor of environmental change and public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. \u201cWe are subjecting young people and future generations to these increasing [health] risks for many hundreds of years to come, if not millennia,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to try to minimise the effects and move towards a low-carbon economy. \u201cWe think reframing climate change as a health issue can help to engage the public because most people are not just concerned about their own health, but about the health of their nearest and dearest and their descendants. \u201cWe think this is a way of mobilising the public and raising concern in a constructive way and increasing the momentum for change.\u201d Global carbon emissions are still rising but scientists say rapid and deep cuts are needed to limit temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels and avoid the worst impacts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
