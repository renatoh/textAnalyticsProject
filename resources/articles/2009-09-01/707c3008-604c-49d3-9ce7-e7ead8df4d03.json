Monza, a dramatic enough theatre even when the ancient autodrome is empty, will reverberate with more passion than usual following Ferrari's first win of the season in Belgium last Sunday. Monza could not have asked for a more effective call to the faithful followers of what amounts to the only national team in F1 even though Ferrari has no hope of winning the title. Monza often goes a long way towards either settling the championship or prompting the defining of status within teams fortunate enough to have had two drivers previously in a position to fight for the crown. All of that would be plausible in a normal season of racing. But, as the last race showed with dramatic clarity, 2009 is anything but normal. The destiny of the title remains just as obscure as the identity of the favourite to succeed next Sunday. Kimi Raikkonen was the sixth different winner in six races, a statistic that would have been the subject of derision had it been predicted on 7 June after Jenson Button had won six of the first seven races. Rather than discussing diversity of success, the talk that evening in Turkey was whether the four races following Monza would be worth attending because Button would surely have become the second Englishman in successive years to be crowned world champion. The most extraordinary statistic now is that Button still heads the table by the same margin he had in his pocket after six races. Despite a lean period collecting 11 points, compared to the 61 he had amassed after Turkey, Button can hardly believe his luck as rivals take turns to stumble in the rush to kick the Brawn driver when he is down. The Belgian Grand Prix was a case in point. Button failed to score for the first time in 12 races thanks to being the victim of a first-lap collision which he could have avoided by making a better job of qualifying and removing himself from the rough company in the middle of the field. His worst grid position of the season had become a personal issue when Rubens Barrichello showed there was nothing wrong with the Brawn-Mercedes, only for the Brazilian to squander his second-row start by, not for the first time, making an appalling getaway and consigning himself to an afternoon chasing seventh place. Had Barrichello finished third, a reasonable assumption in light of what happened during the race, Button would have been looking at a 12-point lead. Depending on how the 53 laps of Monza pan out, Brawn's decision over future priority could become easier if Barrichello drops further behind. On the other hand, another dismal weekend for Button and a repeat of Barrichello's form in Valencia could allow the veteran to expect parity to continue to Singapore and Japan. Mark Webber and Sebastian Vettel, separated by 1.5 points, have no option but to carry on fighting each other as well as Brawn following a disappointing time at Spa, a track where the Red Bulls were supposed to blow away the opposition. But such a forecast did not take into account the infinitesimal technical variables that are dictating one of the closest seasons in recent years. Force India, scarcely mentioned in 2009, would have won in Belgium had not the first-lap collision prompted the safety car and allowed Raikkonen to use his Kers boost button (unique to Ferrari and McLaren in that race) and snatch the lead at the restart. Observers have been so surprised by Giancarlo Fisichella's pole position and exceptional chase of Raikkonen that one former world champion was heard to ask off the record if Force India had somehow been favoured at a time when the British-based team was known to be struggling financially and in need of a boost. The truth is that Spa was the first of just two tracks this year to require cars to run with a different aerodynamic set-up, one that suited the Force India and will do so again at Monza, another fast circuit requiring less downforce. Nonetheless, thoughts of foul play are a sad but perhaps unsurprising reflection of F1's image. That impression was promoted on Monday by stories that Renault might have contrived to influence the result of last year's Singapore Grand Prix by having their driver, Nelson Piquet Jr, crash at a strategic moment that helped his team mate, Fernando Alonso, to a surprise victory. The sport's governing body, FIA, was deliberately vague about the circumstances of the inquiry, and Bernie Ecclestone added to the inevitable innuendo by leaking Renault's name, even though policing of the sport is outside the remit of F1's commercial rights holder. Opinion is sharply divided over whether such a tactic is possible by stealth but, either way, the negative publicity could be the final straw for Renault. In the meantime, for two hours next Sunday afternoon, the sport should return to its more acceptable roots."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
