Victor Anichebe is currently the only Everton forward available to the manager, David Moyes, who is hoping to improve his attacking options before Sunday's FA Cup fourth-round tie with Liverpool at Anfield. Almeida, 24, who joined Bremen from Porto in 2007, is one of several strikers Everton are pursuing this month and a loan-deal offer has been made to the German club. Moyes is also expected to complete the signing of Sligo Rovers' 20-year-old right-back, Seamus Coleman, for a fee of around \u00a3200,000 this week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
