Bank of England governor Mark Carney probably rates himself in that company (or, at the very least, superior to Sir Clive) and the Canadian will show up at the university's delightful campus this week to deliver his latest address to the nation. There he'll likely have another stab at his pet policy of \"forward guidance\" (aka guidance), where he attempts to keep interest rates down by persuading markets the Bank rate will stay at historic lows. The problem has been that, so far, the markets don't appear to believe him: gilt yields have been on the rise, with returns on 10-year bonds moving stubbornly with US Treasuries. Even short-term rates have increased. All of which will seem apt in Nottingham. Granger's principal contribution was recognising that all things do not revert to a fixed point or trend: with the classic analogy being of a drunkard's walk, which has little tendency to return to a straight line marking the path home. The theory's not really meant to apply to interest rates, but for the moment it looks apposite. At Granger's alma mater, Carney will again attempt to show he can guide the soak home. One thing the Co-op's dead good at \"We are good with money whichever way you look at it.\" So says the website of the Co-operative's financial services arm, but whichever way outsiders look at it, that slogan appears to be a bad joke. The bank is currently asking bondholders to help raise \u00a3500m to meet demands by the Prudential Regulation Authority to plug gaps in its finances \u2013 which has gone down rather badly as bondholders have already been hit by the City regulator's block on the Co-op paying them \u00a37m in interest owed, at least until the business's finances are improved. Also included in that group are 15,000 ordinary savers, who this week will be studying the Co-op's finances when the organisation releases interim results (a week later than scheduled). The numbers will provide the backdrop for the deal to be offered to bondholders, which currently includes shares in a Co-operative Bank freshly listed on the stock exchange. The numbers will also show results for the whole of the Co-op \u2013 including food, travel and funerals, the latter of which has been highly successful. That's neat. As bondholders might say: the Co-op's good at burying people, whichever way you look at it. WPP spending spree In the world of advertising, much of the chatter still revolves around the $35bn merger between Publicis and Omnicom unveiled in July. Despite the fanfare at the time, there are plenty now betting the deal will never happen, as the benefits to shareholders seem better-concealed than an adman's sense of self-effacement. Corporate financiers are promising cost savings of $500m (but they always use that figure on big deals) and there's widespread suspicion that the real motivation is that the two bosses \u2013 Maurice Levy and John Wren \u2013 simply want to run the world's biggest advertising group. Still, the proposal has led to speculation that the UK's WPP might buy Interpublic to regain the top slot. WPP boss Sir Martin Sorrell is likely to face questions of that ilk this week as his company unveils interim results, when he'll no doubt repeat his line about concentrating on organic growth. But, as a quick study of the industry mag Media Week shows, since that soundbite the rarely silent knight has sealed several sizeable deals (The Group, Geometry Global, Scangroup, BrandAnalytics Consultoria, SecondSync, Designercity and Verticurl). In a first for the advertising industry, could it be that reality is not quite matching the tagline?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
