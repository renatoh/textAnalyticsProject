This has been overcoming me somewhat in recent years, and I had been wondering whether 46 is a particularly dangerous age for this kind of mental overheating. But when I realised it was afflicting more people of other ages too, I decided I had to write a book about it. Because it struck me that there were suddenly many more of us enraged about the same kind of things, and that they tended to come under the category of \"authenticity issues\" - about the disappearance of real things from our lives. What have these small rages - a simple visit to a corporate website, an encounter with a call centre or a short journey almost anywhere by train are enough to set me off - got to do with authenticity? Let me explain. I think it's the little things that make experiences, products, services or even places real or unreal, and their absence that is so infuriating. The problem is that modern, rationalised organisations try to remove all the small and apparently irrelevant details that make dealing with them bearable and human: conversation, flexibility, humanity. Those who run the world do not believe it is important for hospital patients to see the same doctor they saw yesterday. Or that call centre staff should be able to help, even if your particular problem does not have a corresponding box on their software. They do not see that it is the little things that call centre staff in Bangalore can't know about the UK rail system that make all the difference - the knowledge you can't put on software. That is why I was recently unable to get train times to Penge; the man I was speaking to pronounced it \"Pengy\". I recently watched one old gentleman, forced into the supermarket by the closure of his local shop, enrage queue and staff alike by trying to chat to the check-out person, as he used to do. I don't think we are wealthier for the loss of that very little human service. But then big organisations do not believe human beings have three dimensions. It is only human, for example, to need a lavatory occasionally on the train. But because train companies believe we need only to get from A to B, they don't bother to mend them. Or, like South West Trains during the summer, they replace the only lavatory at Clapham Junction - the busiest station in Europe - with three booths through the car park, down the road and round the corner, one of which required a disabled key to open. If their customers had been one-dimensional machines, that might have been adequate. As it was, people tended to use the car park, if they dared. Perhaps that's what was always intended. That's what I mean about authenticity. Perhaps this is the kind of stuff romantics rant on about when they are nearly 50, and as I was writing the book I worried a little that it was after all just an age thing. The middle-aged should have got used to believing that the loss of little things - along with little shops and little high streets - was an inevitable by-product of a meaningless concept our betters called \"progress\", but I think more of us of all ages are now rejecting that idea and realising that these days we use the word \"real\" to mean something very specific, which we may not be able to define, but which we can recognise in an instant. A friend of mine announced at a dinner party that he had bought a flat in Paris because the shops there were \"real\", and everyone seemed to know immediately what he meant - locally owned, personal, baking on the premises, odd smells and so on. I think it's these things, that accountants and chief executives earn bonuses for abolishing, that make life authentic and three-dimensional, and therefore human. Because little things actually make a big difference. I don't just mean butterflies flapping and weather patterns in China; I mean the importance to people of walking to the shops and back safely, a human moment with the doctor, even the litter in the street - all of which fly below the radar of the technocrats. These are what make a difference to people's lives. It's a tough lesson for politicians, who would generally prefer to be off invading Iraq. If you want to change the world, you have to deal directly with real people in real places, and with very little things. But I don't feel hopeless. Modern, rational systems are too shallow to be authentic. Yet you only have to look at adverts these days to see how much people want their products and services real. They may not want authenticity as much as they say they do, but the massive growth of real ale, natural yoghurt, complementary medicines, farmers' markets, slow food, organic vegetables, unmixed music and much else besides, shows that they still want it. And what enough people want, in a market economy, they will eventually start to get. After which I may be able to control my temper better on trains. \u00b7 David Boyle's Authenticity: Brands, Fakes, Spin and the Lust for Real Life is published by Harper Perennial"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
