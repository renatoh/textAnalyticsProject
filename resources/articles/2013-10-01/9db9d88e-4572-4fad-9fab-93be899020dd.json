Lamb said it was the next stage of public sector reform. He said: \"There is an imperative on all of us to find ways to make all public services, including health, more efficient in straightened economic times. \"There is a wealth of research showing mutuals can lead to greater job satisfaction, higher productivity and reduced absenteeism. In too many cases dedicated NHS staff do not feel listened to and feel beset by top down instructions. \"The aim is to explore how we spread employee engagement including whether mutuals are possible in acute hospitals or foundation trusts. This is not about another top down reorganisation, or a big bang overnight but something institutions would have to want to do. \"It is also not about assets, such as NHS land and buildings, being taken out of the public sector. But we should be able to explore mutuals running hospitals.\" The review is to be led by Professor Chris Ham from the Kings Fund, a strong advocate of greater employee participation in the NHS. He is being joined by a panel that includes Professor Julian Le Grand, a public services reform adviser to Tony Blair, as well as a host of NHS chief executives, including Andrew Foster, former director general for Workforce at the Department of Health. Lamb told the Guardian: \"I think we have got to put employee participation at the centre of the next stage of of the reform of public services\". There is already a right for employees to request run public services in the NHS and other public services, and some examples such as Surrey Central Health which has provided community health services since community health services created back in 2006. In June the government added \u00a319m to a pot to encourage the growth of mutuals, but there has been little progress. Lamb said: \"There seem to be obstacles spreading these ideas \u2013 some of them cultural within the NHS as much as legal. There is no reason why mutuals shouldn't include acute hospitals or foundation trusts. \"There is already a requirement for foundation trusts to involve the public and patients, but there is no similar duty to involve employees. This does not have to be a top down reorganisation, but something that develops from below.\" As business minister Lamb set up the Nuttall Review into employee ownership in the private sector, and clearly feels this is an issue that will be examined in the public sector with greater enthusiasm as spending cuts continue to bite. The review will also have to look at how mutuals can compete for contracts with private sector rivals such as Virgin health that might provide economies of scale, as opposed to productivity. The review will primarily examine the hospital sector, but it will also consider primary and community care and interrelationships with social care. Ham has previously published studies in this field. He wrote: \"Unions have been opposed to moves to create a market in the NHS and introduce new forms of provider organisation. Although their opposition has been principally focused on the increased involvement of commercial companies, this underlies a more general unease about what is seen as dismantling of the NHS family and erosion of public service values. \"But the terms of reference for the review state it will not \"consider matters relating to pay, pensions or other terms and conditions of employment for NHS staff.\" \u2022 This article was amended on 10 October 2013. The original version wrongly quoted Lamb as saying: \"There is no reason why mutuals should include acute hospitals or foundation trusts.\" In fact he said \"shouldn't include\". Also, a reference has been removed to Andrew Lansley setting up a \u00a319m pot to encourage mutuals in June. Lansley was not health secretary at the time, and the \u00a319m was in addition to a pot already established."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
