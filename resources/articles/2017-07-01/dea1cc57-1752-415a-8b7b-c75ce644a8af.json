It is understood United price the Croat at closer to \u00a340m and so the fee may be about \u00a345m. Luciano Spalletti, the Inter manager, wants the player to stay but Perisic is intent on a move to Old Trafford. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho is keen to reinforce his forward line with the 28-year-old who largely operates in wide positions. The United manager remains doubtful about the quality of Anthony Martial, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Jesse Lingard. He complained about their lack of cutting edge on several occasions last season. Perisic can also play in a central attacking role. Inter, who have signed Fiorentina\u2019s Borja Valero, leave for China on 18 July and play Schalke in Changzhou on 22 July. Perisic linked up with Inter for their pre-season camp at Riscone di Brunico but if the transfer is completed in time Mourinho may ask him to fly to the USA. United are in a training camp at Los Angeles\u2019s UCLA complex. Their five-match tour begins with Saturday\u2019s friendly against LA Galaxy at the StubHub Center."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
