It is derived from the peyote cactus and other members of the cactus family, was first synthesised in the laboratory in the early 20th century, and was made famous by Aldous Huxley\u2019s thoughtful account of his experimentation with the drug in The Doors of Perception (1954) and Hunter S Thompson\u2019s completely frenzied account of his experiences on \u201cthe fiendish cactus juice\u201d in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1971). Mike Jay is an eminent writer on mind-stilling and mind-expanding substances, having written numerous books, including what is by far the best study of laughing gas (The Atmosphere of Heaven), and just about the only book on the ancient ritual drink soma (The Blue Tide). Mescaline reads like the culmination of a lifetime\u2019s wanderings in the very farthest outposts of scientific and medical history. It roams from speculation about the use of psychedelic snuff in the prehistoric Chav\u00edn culture of the northern Andes, to descriptions of the pre-conquest peyote rituals of the Nahua in Mexico and Comanche chief Quanah Parker\u2019s promotion of the peyote religion, to a detailed account and analysis of Walter Benjamin\u2019s drug habit, the CIA\u2019s covert MK-Ultra drug-testing programme, and the recent popularity of ayahuasca ceremonies. Who knew that Frederick Madison Smith, grandson of Joseph Smith and the third Mormon prophet-president, was a peyote enthusiast? Despite its breadth \u2013 because of its breadth \u2013 Jay\u2019s is a highly nuanced account. His aim is to study the uses and effects of mescaline in its many and diverse historical and cultural contexts. Western modernity, he notes, has often focused on the nature of mescaline visions, ascribing them meanings variously \u201cneurological, literary, occult, psychodynamic, aesthetic, spiritual\u201d, while indigenous cultures have tended to regard the visions as of merely peripheral interest, compared to the life-enhancing importance of rituals and ceremonies. \u201cThe distinction,\u201d he notes, \u201cbetween western and indigenous understandings of mescaline maps closely, though not exactly, on to the distinction between pure mescaline, the product of the 20th-century laboratory, and its natural sources: two families of cactus, the peyote of Mexico and the San Pedro of the Andes.\u201d The book is by no means a user\u2019s guide, but Jay clearly has some personal interest in the subject. \u201cMy uncle Peter \u2026 after reading The Doors of Perception \u2026 visited the office of Aldrich, the research chemical supplier, outside London and casually requested some \u2026 He was sold half a kilo, over a thousand doses, which kept the beatnik vanguard of Soho and the Sussex coasts supplied for some time.\u201d The book ends with the author\u2019s account of his own participation in an elaborate and mystical peyote ceremony, though his account of an earlier rough-and-ready experiment with some boiled cactus and cane sugar is perhaps rather more revealing, as well as off-putting: \u201cLanguorous muscle relaxation combined with tremors, restlessness and nausea; fizzing euphoria with the ominous sensation of a fast-rising fever; a thrumming vibration in the chest with a cold heaviness in the limbs.\u201d The warm glow from a swift half after work or a stiff G&amp;T this is not. Undoubtedly the most famous description of the effects of taking mescaline is from The Doors of Perception, in which Huxley describes \u201cThose folds in the trousers \u2013 what a labyrinth of endlessly significant complexity! And the texture of the grey flannel \u2013 how rich, how deeply, mysteriously sumptuous!\u201d Jay notes that Huxley had in fact been wearing jeans during the actual experiment and that it was only his wife Maria\u2019s insistence that he should be rather \u201cbetter dressed\u201d for his readers that turned Huxley\u2019s blue jeans into grey flannel.
