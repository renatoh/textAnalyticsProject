People travelled from across the capital and from cities including Leeds and Manchester to attend the vigil in Potters Fields park, many clutching bunches of flowers, and stood in a hushed silence. Standing on stage, flanked by the home secretary, Amber Rudd, the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, gave a short but powerful speech of defiance, saying: \u201cLondon will never be broken by terrorism.\u201d Khan said: \u201cWe are here in remembrance for the innocent lives lost and the people injured in the barbaric attack on our city on Saturday night. \u201cLondon stands in defiance against this cowardly attack on our city, our people, our values and our way of life. I want to send a clear message to the sick and evil extremists who committed these hideous crimes. We will defeat you. You will not win.\u201d He added: \u201cAs a proud and patriotic British Muslim I say this: You do not commit these disgusting acts in my name. Your perverse ideology has nothing to do with the true values of Islam and you will never succeed in dividing our city.\u201d Khan thanked the \u201ccourageous\u201d emergency services and those Londoners who risked their lives during the attack in Borough Market to help those caught up in the violence. He emphasised that while terror and sorrow had struck at the heart of London, the values of its citizens remained steadfast and that \u201cthe love you have for one another will also be greater than the hate of the extremists\u201d. He added: \u201cThis is our city, these are our values and this is our way of life. London will never be broken by terrorism and we will put up a fight against extremism and we will defeat the terrorists.\u201d Standing in the crowd, bearing the banner with the sign Not In My Name, was Qasim Chowdhury, 38, who said the Muslim community of London was shocked at the attack. He said it had been important for him to see Sadiq Khan emphasising how those who carried out the stabbings in the busy restaurants and pubs of Borough market were not representative of the values of Islam. \u201cThis was a barbaric act, a heinous crime, and there\u2019s no place for that in our religion,\u201d said Chowdhury. \u201cIf you look at the meaning of Islam, it means peace, so for Islam to be associated with these types of crimes, these murderous acts, it has really shaken our whole community.\u201d He said he and many around him were worried about how terror and fear might change the welcoming spirit of London. \u201cI never for once thought I would be witnessing this in my life,\u201d said Chowdhury, who grew up in the city. \u201cIslam is unfortunately now on the back foot because of the actions of a few.\u201d One family of three, who stood in the crowd sobbing after Khan\u2019s speech and asked not to be named, said simply that they had lost someone in the Manchester terror attacks last week and had come to London to show \u201csolidarity and strength\u201d. Also in the crowd were Hannah Jackson and Sam Williams, both 31, who brought their five-month old baby Betsy to the vigil in an \u201cact of unity and defiance\u201d. Williams said: \u201cWhen these kinds of attacks are becoming more frequent in London, it feels so important for people from all different background and all different faiths to come together. We\u2019ve just had a baby and we don\u2019t want her to grow up in a city which is divided or defined by fear.\u201d They said they had been shaken that the attacks had taken place in an area they go out in often and had made terrorism feel so close to home. \u201cIt could so easily have been us or people we knew. I can\u2019t help but feel this will make people afraid, when they are specifically targeting innocent people who are going out and enjoying themselves. I am worried what it will do to the spirit of London,\u201d said Jackson. Michelle Ford, 47, who carried a few red roses, said she had been out in Borough Market just 24 hours before and used to work in London Bridge. \u201cI still feel numb about it all,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve come here today because I still need to make sense of it all. But also to say that I think London is bigger than this, we are resilient.\u201d Members of the crowd were invited to lay flowers at the flagpole outside City Hall, and despite torrential rain, they queued patiently. The identities of most of the seven people who lost their lives have still not been made public, but many left notes in remembrance. A postcard tied to a bunch of roses read: \u201cTo all those who lost their lives, London will never forget you. You are in all of our memories forever.\u201d Among those laying flowers was a man who referred to himself as Cockney Keith, who is a Big Issue vendor outside London Bridge station. He said that in the light of recent cuts to police numbers, he was reassured to hear the London mayor being firm that London would not bow to terror. \u201cWe live in scary times but it is important to be resilient,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
