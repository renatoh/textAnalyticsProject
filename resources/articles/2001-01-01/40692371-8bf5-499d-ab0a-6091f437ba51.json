Before the former England coach came galloping to their rescue late last year, Middlesbrough would probably have lost this tight and rather listless tie. But a renewed sense of purpose has precipitated a change of fortune and a diligent second-half performance was sufficient to see them safely through to a home fourth round meeting with either Wimbledon or Notts County. As for Bradford City, they can now devote their time and efforts to defending their Premiership status. Only rarely during the course of a career notable for its disciplinarian leanings has Jim Jefferies allowed sentimentality to cloud his judgment and last night, with the season of goodwill still warm on the slab, the Scotsman removed the iron fist from within the velvet glove. With the sense of timing which is peculiar, indeed, almost unique, to football managers, Jefferies chose a match-day to name - and thus shame - those who he regards as surplus to Bradford's requirements. An intriguing and distinguished roll of dishonour it was too. Among those deemed incapable of adding to the Yorkshire's club's grim, arguably futile, fight for Premiership salvation were Benito Carbone, Dan Petrescu, Lee Sharpe, Gunnar Halle and, of course, Stanley Victor Collymore. All will now be invited to find gainful employment away from Valley Parade, an exercise which, if successful, would save a hard-up club around \u00a3100,000 a week in wages. \"My first-team squad is now too big and it's important we cut the wage bill,\" said Jefferies. \"What we have to do in the remaining months of the season is play as a team, a collective unit, rather than as a group of individuals.\" Collymore, for one, now finds himself in a familiar state of limbo. Unwanted by Bradford, his proposed move to German club Stuttgart also slipped away yesterday. \"A move abroad does appeal to me,\" said Collymore. \"I would like to stay in the Premiership and be a top goalscorer but that is now going to be difficult. I have to ask, 'who's going to take me now?'\" Bradford could have done with Collymore and his fellow flops. Not on the pitch but in the stands for the stadium held a paltry 7,303 on a night when the magic of the FA Cup was hardly in evidence. The match itself was open enough if lacking in depth and colour. Had the finishing been slightly more clinical an opening half which growled rather than roared would have been awash with goals. It wasn't because in sub-zero temperatures even the most cultured of feet were rendered impotent. Robert Molenaar went closest while the adrenalin rush was at its most pronounced, his fine header from an Eoin Jess corner thumping against the base of a post. Dean Saunders really should have scored after collecting the rebound but these days he is profligate rather than prolific. But, at least the ageing Welshman is still an enthusiast and midway through the opening half he steered a firm drive just wide of the mark after the Middlesbrough defence stood idly by. Although the Bradford defence shook like needles on a discarded Christmas tree every time Alen Boksic was in possession, they held firm without apparent discomfort. For a team with manifold problems, Bradford's football was remarkably precise and patient; slowly but surely it would seem that lessons are being learned. But, no matter how attractive your approach play all is irrelevant if there is no cutting blade up front. The better of their openings invariably fell the way of Dean Windass, who steered in shots from wherever it was he was standing after establishing control of the ball. The closest he came was shortly after the interval when his ferocious drive from just outside the penalty area almost embarrassed goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer who spooned the ball away to relative safety. And then rather perversely, Middlesbrough emerged from their bunker to score. It was a magnificent goal out of keeping with the mundane proceedings, Hamilton Ricard arrowing a sublime shot into the top corner from 20 or so yards. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
