Boro might have been four up when Kevin Campbell equalised after half an hour and seven up by half-time, when David Moyes introduced Wayne Rooney and changed from 4-4-2 to 4-3-3. The tide turned. It was not all Rooney or even chiefly Rooney, the 16-year-old whose kit is sponsored by suppliers of beers, wines and spirits. (His 5ft 8in team-mate Tony Hibbert, incidentally, has no kit sponsor, presumably as the shorts of the day look on him like hand-me-downs from Pete Sampras's grandad.) But, as Moyes said: \"Wayne gave us new energy. \"He made a big difference and we'll use him at the right time. But we can't expect him to carry the whole weight of the club.\" That weight is deader than most. There is a lot of old energy, especially in defence. David Weir, smarting from remarks by his Scotland manager Bertie Vogts, said bravely beforehand: \"I'll answer my critics on the pitch.\" Inside the first minute Massimo Maccarone went past him like a Faroese schoolteacher and missed the first of those seven chances. After 10 Weir passed loosely to Geremi, Maccarone was away again and Szilard Nemeth rounded off. For half an hour Everton were going nowhere except backwards, not even to King's Dock perhaps, where they are supposed to be moving. They have eight weeks to find \u00a330m, the same sum as their debt. Boro rolled them back with a 3-4-3 formula revolving about Geremi and Jonathan Greening in the middle. Then Campbell, twice the age of Rooney and nearing the first anniversary of his last Goodison league goal, prodded in as Tomasz Radzinski's header crossed the goalface off a post. He was to be an unlikely hero. Early in the second half Maccarone hit the same post, the ball followed the same path and Paul Gerrard foiled the follow-up danger. Everton have cornered the market in England Under-21 keepers, with Steve Simonsen and Richard Wright as well, but all have absorbed the club's ambition rather than raised it. Neville Southall spoiled Everton. Thereafter it was almost all Everton. Geremi vanished into Thomas Gravesen's pocket and the Dane ran the show. Boro's wide midfielders were called on more in defence and Li Tie, the Chinese checker in front of Everton's back four, showed to advantage in a wiry, creative way instead of frantic chasing. At kick-off Everton topped the Premiership charts in corners. There was no sign that practice had perfected their drill but just after Gareth Southgate had gone off injured, replaced by the striker Noel Whelan, the unmarked Campbell glanced in Gravesen's kick. Moyes called it \"reward for past performances\". Steve McClaren was left to wonder if attack really is his best form of defence.
