Outgoing crossbench senator Tim Storer used his last days in Senate estimates to put a series of questions to cabinet ministers about their dealings with lobbyists, both in-house and third-party, between January and April this year. He has received three responses: from Cormann, the energy minister, Angus Taylor, and the then environment minister, Melissa Price. Cormann provided a comprehensive list of 31 groups he had met with, including representatives from Santos, Anglo American, Rio Tinto, Google, Ebay, IBM Global Markets, AmazonPrime, the West Australian hotels lobby and Wesfarmers. The list is far more illuminating than the lobbyist register \u2013 the public\u2019s only real window into lobbying of Australian politicians \u2013 which gives no sense of who ministers are giving access to. Storer has applauded Cormann\u2019s openness and said he hoped it could set a precedent for transparency. Price said she had met with two lobbyists: Bossy Group\u2019s Peter McMahon, a former adviser to Joe Hockey, and Macquarie Group\u2019s head of government relations, Navleen Prasad. Bossy Group\u2019s clients include Emanuel Exports, the company at the centre of the live export controversy, and the Indian IT consulting conglomerate Infosys. Taylor, however, said he had met with no lobbyists, either in-house or third-party, in the three months. Storer doubted the accuracy of that statement and called on Taylor to reconsider his response. \u201cIt would seem to me that minister Taylor and Price have only disclosed meetings they have had with registered third-party lobbyists, despite me specifically asking them to also provide me with details of meetings they had with both in-house and third-party lobbyists,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe response from minister Taylor and Price stands in stark contrast to the comprehensive list provided by Senator Cormann. \u201cI encourage minister Taylor and Price to revisit the terms of the question I put to them and return to me with a more accurate list.\u201d A spokeswoman for Taylor said he had relied on the definition of lobbyists in the federal lobbying rules. That definition includes only registered third-party lobbyists, not in-house lobbyists. \u201cDuring the time period requested by Senator Storer, minister Taylor has no record of meeting with any lobbyist, as defined in the lobbying code of conduct,\u201d she said. Storer did not recontest his Senate seat in the recent election but used his last months in parliament to campaign hard for greater transparency, integrity, and for a federal integrity commission to be established. He recently wrote to the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and other cabinet ministers to urge them to regularly publish their diaries. The practice is in place in Queensland and New South Wales, where quarterly publications of ministerial diaries reveals who is getting access to the most powerful people in each state. The federal government has so far shown no interest in releasing ministerial diaries. Where they are requested through freedom of information, ministers have typically resisted their publication in any form, released heavily redacted versions, or published in a format that hides the contents and persons involved in their meetings. Storer urged Morrison to follow the example of Queensland and NSW. \u201cI believe such reporting is simple yet will be of significant benefit to the public in terms of their desire for parliamentary transparency,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will show in a concise format the hard-working approach of yourself and your ministers in their weekly schedules, both during and outside of parliamentary sitting weeks.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
