The award was presented to her by Tyler, the Creator and by Janet Jackson, who told her: \u201cYou are loved for your style.\u201d Rihanna thanked the British Fashion Council and her collaborators. She was previously nominated for her Fenty x Puma collaboration in 2017. The model Naomi Campbell also collected a prize \u2013 the Fashion Icon award. In her extensive acceptance speech, a tearful Campbell called the honour a \u201cdeeply humbling experience\u201d. She thanked fellow models Linda Evangelista, Kate Moss and Christy Turlington \u2013 her \u201csisters for life\u201d \u2013 as well as Gianni Versace, the late fashion designer. Campbell said she was the \u201cfirst woman of colour to receive this award\u201d before thanking women who she said had come before her, including Janet Jackson, Tina Turner, Iman, Bethann Hardison and Eartha Kitt. As a campaigner for inclusivity in fashion and one of the founders of the Diversity Coalition, Campbell called for \u201cdiversity in the workplace and in everything we do.\u201d The Fashion Awards honoured the British designer Daniel Lee, the man responsible for revitalising Bottega Veneta since July 2018. He picked up four awards: British designer of the year womenswear, designer of the year, accessories designer of the year and brand of the year. Adut Akech won model of the year and Giorgio Armani picked up the outstanding achievement award, which was presented to him by Julia Roberts and Cate Blanchett, who said he revolutionised dressing on the red carpet. The collective signatories of the fashion industry charter for climate change (which included Stella McCartney, Burberry and Nike) won the positive change award, for individuals and fashion brands who are making concerted efforts to be more sustainable. Earlier this year, an agreement in Paris signed by many of the top fashion houses agreed to net zero emissions by 2050. \u201cWe need leaders from prominent and influential industries like fashion to step up in a big way, and we hope this initiative will give a push in the right direction,\u201d Robert Skinner, executive director of the UN Office for Partnerships, told the Guardian. Rihanna\u2019s victory caps off a game-changing year for the singer, which has seen her making huge strides for racial advancement within the industry. With Fenty, Barbadian Rihanna became the first black woman to head a major fashion house, in conjunction with luxury goods company LVMH (Christian Dior, Celine, Marc Jacobs). And, through its cosmetics subsidiary, Fenty Beauty (with its \u201cfoundation for all\u201d philosophy) , she helped democratise make-up, introducing more shades of foundation than had been previously been available from a cosmetic company before. Fenty Beauty has been condemned by some for not being inclusive enough, but has made strides to become more so. \u201cSome [people] are finding their shade of foundation for the first time, getting emotional at the counter,\u201d she explained to Time magazine. \u201cThat\u2019s something I will never get over.\u201d It has led to other brands like MAC, Covergirl and Maybelline dramatically increasing the number of foundations on offer. In September, the singer launched the autumn/winter line of her Savage X Fenty lingerie range, premiering it with a high-profile, guest-heavy fashion show cum musical extravaganza that streamed exclusively on Amazon Prime. Featuring a range of diverse models in all shapes and sizes (including transgender actor/model Laverne Cox and plus-size model Margie Plus) the body positive brand stood in stark contrast to Victoria\u2019s Secret, whose singular vision of beauty was seen by many as outdated and not inclusive. In an interview after the Savage X Fenty show, Rihanna said: \u201cI don\u2019t care about any skinny Victoria\u2019s Secret model \u2026 there are a lot of women out there who are feeling in the dark, invisible, [saying]: \u2018I can\u2019t try that on because I\u2019m not made like that.\u2019 This is where you feel safe, right here at Savage.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
