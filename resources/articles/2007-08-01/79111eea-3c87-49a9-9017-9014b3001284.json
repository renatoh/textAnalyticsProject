Hit your 40s and not a month goes by without some friend bringing over their new wife for inspection. One chum did introduce us to the classic midlife-crisis choice: half his age and with legs to die for. But mostly, when you meet a divorced friend's second wife (it usually is a wife, as males are more likely to remarry), you want to ask: 'What for?' Why go through all that emotional pain for someone who is a clone of wife number 1 or a noticeably inferior model? And what about us? We, the friends, who've offered him our spare room, brought out the whisky bottle, handed out advice, who now have to watch history repeat itself. Look at Chris Tarrant: he has had to part with half his fortune, suffered the humiliation of wife Ingrid telling a tabloid that he smells like a fish and can't get it up, and for what? The fiftysomething for whom he ditched fiftysomething Ingrid looks the same - but less fun. Where were his friends to warn him off? Or think of Prince Charles. Camilla seems a good sort, but did he ask the inner circle at Clarence House whether the public humiliation of a royal divorce was a price worth paying to swap a global pin-up for a WI calendar girl? Then there's Rod Stewart. Penny Lancaster might have replaced Rachel Hunter (who, in turn, replaced Alana Hamilton), but can anyone - even Rod - tell these blonde clones apart? His friends must be bracing themselves for a third disaster. I believe everyone deserves a second chance at happiness - I'm a second wife. When my husband first brought me round to his friends, we hadn't married yet. They'd been there for him during his marriage break-up and felt they had a lot at stake in his new choice. They were right to look hard. For too many people, a second marriage is a cop-out. They either lower their sights or seek the all too familiar. No wonder second marriages are more likely to fail (half do, as opposed to 40 per cent of first marriages). Which is why my husband wisely took counsel. And why any man entering into second marriage should rely on his friends' judgment as well as his own. After all, they have got you to the point where you can even consider tying the knot again and probably know you better than your spouse-to-be. For a first try at hot monogamy, you can make your own decisions. But the second one needs careful vetting. It's in your friends' interest to keep you from going to pieces again... so they won't need to pick you up again. What a busy boy Rosemary Hill's much-praised God's Architect, the biography of Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin, the Romantic who, with Charles Barry, designed a large part of the Palace of Westminster, including sketching an idea for the Clock Tower, was more than 10 years in the making. After this lengthy gestation, the author began to wonder if she had somehow become dangerously obsessed with her subject. While she was sitting through a lecture on the history of architecture in New York recently, a Post-it note made its way to her lap: 'I need to talk to you after the lecture. Wait for me.' It was signed 'Welby Pugin'. He turned out to be the great-grandson of Byron Welby Pugin, who may have also been Pugin's illegitimate son. Hill is sceptical about the claim: how could Pugin have found the time when he was working flat out, had eight legitimate children and died at 40?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
