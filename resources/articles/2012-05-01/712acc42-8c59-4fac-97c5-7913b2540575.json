The college, which traces its origins back to 1760, these days has 1,700 students from all over the world. Four-year courses lead to BA (Hons) degrees in any of 15 specialist art or design subjects, with architecture and landscape architecture offering qualifications recognised within these chartered professions. The college will merge with the University of Edinburgh on 1 August 2011, but will retain its identity and ethos, its campus and its pedagogical methods. Fees Scottish and (non-UK) EU students can get their tuition fees paid, but this may change for 2012 entry. \u00a31,820 for other full-time undergraduates in 2011-12; international (non-EU) students pay more. The Scottish government has yet to agree the tuition fee and student finance model for 2012-13, although it is likely that Scottish students studying in Scotland will continue to pay no tuition fees.
