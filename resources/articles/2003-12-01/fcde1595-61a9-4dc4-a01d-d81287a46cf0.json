Post paella and Purple Tin, Juan Miguel Manuel Ole! Ole! Ole! Fiver likes nothing better than getting his head down for a few hours, ensuring he's refreshed for the evening's bull-badgering in the village square. He doesn't take kindly to being woken, but on this occasion the Fiver had no choice. \"What you want, greengo?\" cried Juan, unaware of the BREAKING NEWS/HOT AIR: Barcelona are about to attempt to prise Thierry Henry from Arsenal's greasy grasp with a BIG-MONEY BID!!! Alas, Juan used language we could never repeat in a family email and hung up, leaving the Fiver with no choice but to cut and paste quotes from elsewhere. \"For next season if the coach [Frank Rijkaard] asks me to sign Henry then we will go for Henry,\" said Barcelona president Joan Laporta, flexing his muscle. The fact he made similar noises about David Beckham in the summer and that Rijkaard's job hangs by a thread after a tawdry first half of the season matters not. \"We have money to sign him [and] he is one of the best players in the world,\" screeched the president, pausing to kiss a baby for the camera. Over at Highbury, Arsene Wenger was doing a Marty Feldman impression, with one eye on tomorrow night's Big Cup game with Lokomotiv Moscow, and the other on Spain. The Prof is still sweating on Henry's fitness. \"He's such an asset and we have to see how he reacts but I'm optimistic,\" he told Arsenal.com, while stuffing a fat brown envelope full of \u00a310 notes into his jacket pocket. According to the Enin' Stanah, it's the \u00a310m he was today given for strengthening his squad in January. Seville's Jose Reyes, the 20-year-old teenage sensation (their description not ours), remains his prime target, but if the Stanah's anything like Laporta, this too should be consumed with a generous vat of salt. GED'S QUOTE OF THE DAY pt.XXXVII (sponsored once again by liverpoolfc.etc) \"He is not the type of player for Liverpool Football Club. We have shown an interest in Jean-Alain Boumsong, but I want players who are happy to play for Liverpool, players who have a desire to pull on the red jersey. If he does not have that desire, it suggests he does not have the commitment to play for Liverpool\" - Ged clearly doesn't live by the adage \"beggars can't be choosers\". BUTT-CHURNING NEWS FOR NICKY It's been a while since we've talked to Bernard ManFiver, the Fiver's fat Mancunian comic friend. But when we bumped into him today, and we'd recovered from his exhaling belly catapulting us across the Arndale Centre, his tongue was as sharp as a Stanley Knife. \"How did the blonde try to kill the fish? Drown it!\" he chuckled, his gut oscillating gently. \"What did Adam say on the day before Christmas? It's Christmas, Eve!\" he topically guffawed, his belt popping open to reveal nicotine-stained y-fronts. Honestly, the Fiver's sides still ache even now. But Bernard wasn't the only Mancunian with a loose tongue today. Because over at Carrington, Nicky Butt was thinking the unthinkable. \"My situation at United has looked bleak this season - I would be lying if I said otherwise,\" he told the Manchester Evening News, while furtively checking behind him for a purple-nosed Scotsman. \"Nobody in their right mind would want to leave this club if they are happy but at times I have thought this could be it for me.\" But there is hope. \"Fergie has told me to be patient and I'll get my chance,\" added Nicky, champing at the bit in anticipation of the fourth round of next season's Carling Cup. Meanwhile, ahead of tonight's Big Cup Group Stage Six clash against Stuttgart, Ruud van Nistelrooy has again been linked with a move to Real Madrid. News that has clearly got Michelin-man striker Ronaldo excited. \"If he comes here, I think we could both play,\" he drooled (although the nearby tapas bar probably had something to do with that). \"There is space for every good player here and he's one of those.\" What's more, David Beckham reckons the Dutch thoroughbred is a \"marvellous companion\" - which will surely make for exciting times on the Real bus next season. THE RUMOUR MILL Ach, where to start, they're probably all just as remote from reality as each other. Alan Smith to Internazionale is a possibility if Leeds' old hanging-on-to-prize-assets plan goes pear-shaped. While his current club-mate might be looking forward to the sunnier climes of Italy, Nick Barmby is being linked with a move to Hull City. Chelsea are apparently going to sign Parma keeper Sebastien Frey, despite already owning four goalies and having one loaned out. They're just doing it for kicks these days, aren't they? And Jay-Jay Okocha has been talking about a move somewhere big. Manchester United, we're saying. NEWS IN BRIEF Fan and benefactor Ed Davies is looking to take over Bolton before the year is out, in a deal which could keep stars like Jay-Jay Okocha at the club despite (a) growing debts and (b) what we said in the Rumour Mill above. \"Ed is the only reason we are in the Premier League,\" said chairman Phil Gartside, dissing Big Sam a big one. Fifa have scuppered any hopes Fabien Barthez had of helping Marseille further down the table before the New Year by upholding the decision to keep the signing within the January transfer window. And there's more vomit-inducing rugger news, and who should be at the centre but Sir Jonny himself. Talking of his new best bud David Beckham, Mr Wilkinson gushed: \"I have wanted to say well done to him for a great game on Saturday night.\" Us too! Us too! Well done, David. Well done, Jonny. And well done, everyone, what a glorious nation.
