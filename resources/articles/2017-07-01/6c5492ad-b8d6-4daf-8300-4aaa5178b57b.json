The Care Quality Commission said that of 4,000 nursing homes, which care for the most vulnerable people at the end of their lives, 32% have been rated inadequate or requires improvement and 37% have been told they must improve safety. The regulator warned that social care was in a \u201cprecarious\u201d state \u2013 and according to Age UK the results leave elderly people and their families \u201cplaying Russian roulette\u201d when they choose a nursing home or other care service. Inspectors making unannounced visits to care homes found medicines being administered unsafely, alarm calls going unanswered and residents not getting help to eat or use the toilet. Some residents were found to have been woken up by night-shift care workers, washed and then put back to bed, apparently to make life easier for staff. Andrea Sutcliffe, chief inspector of adult social care at the Care Quality Commission, which carried out the inspections, said such practice showed a fundamental lack of dignity and respect. She admitted disappointment that only one in 50 of all care services had managed to achieve the top rating of \u201coutstanding\u201d. The picture for nursing homes was the most worrying, Sutcliffe said. \u201cMany of these homes are struggling to recruit and retain well-qualified nursing staff and that means that this is having an impact on delivering good services to people who have got very complex needs,\u201d she said. In a separate interview with BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, she said the commission would shut down failing homes that refused to improve. Where serious failings had occurred, including where staff had been violent towards people in their care, Sutcliffe said the commission would be looking at training and recruitment issues. \u201cHow are they making sure they are recruiting the right kind of people who can give the right kind of service?\u201d The report of the full inspection results will pile pressure on ministers over both the growing crisis in the national nursing workforce \u2013 revealed this week to be shrinking amid discontent over pay and workloads \u2013 and state spending on social care, cut by a cumulative \u00a36bn in England since 2010. Of all adult 24,000 social care services in England, 21% have been judged \u201cinadequate\u201d or \u201crequires improvement\u201d in the first full checks of their kind by the Care Quality Commission \u2013 which have taken almost three years to complete. One quarter of those checked have been found wanting on grounds of safety. Sutcliffe said care was \u201capproaching its tipping point\u201d \u2013 as the CQC warned last autumn \u2013 despite an emergency injection of \u00a32bn government funding over three years. Concern has grown because some services have been downgraded after re-inspection. Of more than 1,800 inspected more than once since 2014, 26% were subsequently relegated to \u201crequires improvement\u201d or even \u201cinadequate\u201d after initially gaining a rating of \u201cgood\u201d. Sutcliffe said that while re-inspections were often prompted by concerns raised by staff, other care professionals or users of the services, the number of facilities downgraded nevertheless underscored the fragility of the sector. Caroline Abrahams, Age UK\u2019s charity director, said it was troubling that a fifth of all services had been judged to need improvement and \u201cpretty scary\u201d that so many nursing homes had fallen below an acceptable threshold. With a quarter of services deemed insuffiently safe, older people and their families were \u201cnow effectively playing Russian roulette when they need care,\u201d she said. Referring to the government\u2019s manifesto pledge of a green paper on the future of social care, Abrahams said: \u201cTaken as a whole, this report is a graphic demonstration of why older people desperately need the government to follow through on its commitment to consult on proposals for strengthening social care later this year.\u201d Jackie Doyle-Price, the newly appointed minister for social care, said: \u201cWhile this report shows that the vast majority of people receive \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018outstanding\u2019 adult social care, it is completely unacceptable that standards in some settings are below those rightly expected by care users and their families.\u201d All registered social care services in England have now been inspected on grounds of safety, effectiveness, whether they are caring, whether responsive and quality of leadership. While nursing homes come out worst, services grouped as \u201ccommunity social care\u201d emerge best. These include sheltered housing with \u201cextra-care\u201d support and so-called \u201cshared lives\u201d schemes whereby people accept others needing care and support into their own homes. By region, the east of England has the best overall results and the north-west the worst. By size, small care homes and homecare services emerge far better than large ones \u2013 three times as many large care homes, with 50 or more beds, being judged inadequate or requiring improvement than small ones with up to 10. Sutcliffe said that although some big homes had proved they could provide outstanding care, smaller homes were often better at the personal touch and at retaining experienced staff. Nicola O\u2019Brien, head of policy and campaigns at Alzheimer\u2019s Society, said the inspection results suggested that thing had got even worse for people with dementia since the CQC\u2019s \u201capproaching tipping point\u201d warning. \u201cToo often we hear the consequences of inadequate care \u2013 our investigation last year revealed people with dementia left in soiled sheets, or becoming ill after eating out-of-date food, and that only a third of homecare workers have received dementia training, leaving families fearing for their loved ones.\u201d Without adequate funding, it was no surprise that care providers were being forced to cut corners, O\u2019Brien said. \u201cWe need to see government act before the care system collapses, with clear detail on consultation for reform that is backed up with action.\u201d Barbara Keeley, Labour\u2019s shadow minister for social care, said: \u201cThis report confirms that the social care funding crisis caused by this government is now seriously affecting the quality of care across the country. \u201cIt is deeply worrying that a quarter of social care services have safety concerns. Behind these statistics are thousands of vulnerable adults failing to get the medicines they have been prescribed, being ignored when they ask for help or having home visits missed.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
