Dads can toss the caber and enter the traditional weight events (only if they're wearing a kilt), while mums can take on the 800m running race or long jump to impress the kids. Unless, of course, the kids are too busy learning to toss the (albeit foam) caber themselves. Throughout the day, traditional games are open to all from spectator tug of war, junior caber tossing, hammer throwing, shot putting and 100m, 200m and 800m races for every age group. For those with less energy, there is a helicopter flyby and landing, a parachute demonstration team, live bands, a fashion show and possible caber tossing records by the pros to be watched.

Red Kite Mountain Bike Bash Mountain biking doesn't come much more pleasant than this weekend in the Cambrian hills, now part of the brilliant calendar of events that the tiny village of Llanwrtyd Wells has built a reputation on - it's the same place that stages the World Bog Snorkelling Championships and the Man versus Horse race. Guides take groups of different abilities along the beautiful trails; more daring groups are promised some thrilling trails and fantastic descents while slower groups will take on gentle forest tracks and have at least one pub/cafe stop per day. Road riding is kept to a minimum. The longest routes last a whole day, while the gentler rides take a morning. Hungry riders can look forward to a barbecue on the Saturday night. There is no age limit although riders under 18 will have to stay with at least one parent. Bikes can be hired locally through two specialist shops advertised on the website. Although not billed as such, the Red Kite Mountain Bike Bash is part of the Green Events series, a non-profit organisation which promotes responsible holidaymaking.
