The flare-up in the Oregon city marred demonstrations that took place across Portland this weekend as part of protests that have continued daily, calling for police restructuring and systemic anti-racism reforms, since George Floyd was killed by police in Minneapolis in May. Portland protests had been in a calmer vein since federal law enforcement agents withdrew in late July, but early Sunday saw a clash at the scene of the arson attack. It was the second time such a fire has been set in recent days. Though both fires were quickly put out, the incidents brought criticism of individuals who have been provoking police by damaging property and other belligerent tactics, in contrast to much wider, calmer protests, according to a report by the Oregonian. Three officers were hurt during efforts to clear a crowd of several hundred people outside the Portland Police Association building, police said in a statement. Rallies had been held earlier in the afternoon and evening throughout the city. Seneca Cayson, a black business owner who helped lead peaceful gatherings in downtown Portland, worries that incidents of vandalism and taunting of law enforcement by a tiny minority of the many thousands of white protesters turning out distracts from the main aims of the Black Lives Matter movement. But he speculated that such clashes also draw more attention to racial injustice and said of white rebels: \u201cWe are fighting alongside them to \u2026 be equal.\u201d Many cite competing voices and the harsh glare of a national spotlight, which has reduced the situation to a culture war when the reality is much more complex. \u201cIt happens so much that the things that we care about get hijacked and get put on the back burner. And that just gets put into a big barrel with everything else,\u201d said Neil Anderson, another local Black business owner. \u201cWe all want the same thing. But so often we get drowned out.\u201d For many, part of breaking down racial barriers means taking funds from and restructuring the police entirely. Portland\u2019s population is less than 6% black but people of color have been disproportionately stopped by a city program that created a gun violence reduction team. An analysis of police use of force published last month found that in 2019 officers were much more likely to use force against black people and particularly young black men than other groups, despite overall trends towards less use of force. \u201cIt is the entire culture of the Portland police bureau that is fundamentally unmanageable and must change,\u201d said Jo Ann Hardesty, the city\u2019s first black councilwoman and an activist who has pressed for police reform for three decades. \u201cThirty years is a long time to be asking for the exact same reforms. The difference now is there are tens of thousands of Portlanders who want the exact same thing,\u201d Hardesty said. Police said demonstrators broke into the union building late Saturday, set the fire and were adding to it when officers made the riot declaration. Democratic mayor Ted Wheeler said violent protesters are serving as political \u201cprops\u201d for Donald Trump in a divisive election season where the president is hammering on a law-and-order message. Meanwhile, Oregon state politicians will discuss on Monday in a special session passing a broader ban on police use of chokeholds and further restricting other use of force, the Oregonian reported on Sunday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
