Kent chose to bat on a pitch that proved to be somewhat two-faced, with spinners probing in tandem before lunch, and found it difficult to get a fruitful stand going. By far the best, 95 for the third wicket between Symonds and Ed Smith, ended unnecessarily when Symonds called his partner for a sharp run. Smith is the sort of athlete who would prefer written notice of a quick single, and Ben Phillips's throw won by a yard. With the South Africa paceman Johann Louw removing the openers David Fulton and Rob Key in quick order, the field was set cagily for Symonds but he soon found ways round it. He was particularly severe on the wayward Carl Greenidge, whose seven overs went to all parts for 48 runs, a blistering cut to the point boundary being particularly memorable. The half-century detained Symonds for just 51 balls, and he conquered the nervous nineties with a four and a six off Jason Brown to reach a 122-ball century, before playing round a straight delivery from Graeme Swann. The rookie wicketkeeper Niall O'Brien worked confidently to give substance to the Kent tail but their total fell well below par. In the evening, once Mark Powell had fallen to a booming leg-cutter from Martin Saggers, Tim Roberts set about putting Kent's effort into perspective in an unbroken stand of 108 with Martin van Jaarsveld as Northamptonshire rubbed in their advantage."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
