Is it merely beer, one drunk quickly after the last and soon before the next? Or the bar staff lining you up a row of shots you've neither ordered nor heard of? Perhaps a woman with bee-stung lips dancing on the bar in a skimpy mock-Alpine outfit. A man called G\u00fcnther who looks like Peter Stringfellow inviting you into his \"exclusive\" lounge. International rock stars performing a gig in the main square. Fine dining, or pumping music, or clubs full of people in Prada. Or just naked couples relaxing in the hotel hot tub? If you're in Ischgl, it's likely to be all these and more. The Austrian resort is, to use the local shorthand, the Ibiza of the Alps, and somewhere between sexy, ludicrous and surreal. Just an hour's transfer from Innsbruck, Ischgl probably hasn't registered more on the British skier's radar for the simple reason that the Germans got there first. Only a small percentage of the visitors are British; this felt especially pronounced at the beginning of the season, before UK package firms had started operating. The Tyrolean resort gets going several weeks ahead of the traditional UK trigger date, the school holidays, usually bolstering its reputation for blistering apres-ski with a big-name concert - this year, The Corrs - for the opening weekend. The pistes were as busy as the Easter holidays, the town lit up like Christmas and people were partying like it was New Year. Not bad for November. (Expect similar scenes for the end of the season's Top of the Mountain concert.) It didn't feel like a place for the shy and retiring. At the bottom of the main run into town - Piste 1, an occasionally treacherous red - a row of bars were already frantic at 4pm, as the skiers started to call it a day. In the packed Schatzi, surgically-altered dancers were jigging on podiums in Alpine-dress-meets-Benny Hill outfits. A favourite drink here is a Jaigermeister cocktail that consists of an open miniature bottle of spirits floating in your Red Bull (itself an Austrian invention), to be necked to the accompaniment of whistle blasts, for reasons that escaped me. It seemed particularly appropriate for the venue, and the chances of remaining sober for long, especially following the adrenalin rush of completing that hairy red run, were minimal. You can imagine it's not to everyone's taste. But it's a big enough resort to allow families or the less boisterous to opt out of the general crush, and whatever turns you on for apres, you're unlikely to be disappointed by the actual ski. With a total of 205km of runs, Ischgl has plenty of long, well-groomed pistes. Beginners and early intermediates will find a wide variety of blue runs around and above the Idalp station served by the major cable cars, and slightly more advanced skiers can stretch out with long and challenging reds back to the village. There are fewer black runs for the most confident skiers but, local ski guides promised us, lots of good off-piste later in the season when sufficient snow has fallen. Boarders have a permanent halfpipe and fun park. At altitudes of between 1,400m and 2,900m, with the assistance of powerful snow-making equipment, skiing back to the valley is pretty much guaranteed from November until May. Parts of the lift system have been upgraded again, and there's plenty of provision to glide around Ischgl even when you're not skiing: moving walkways in tunnels through the village connecting the lifts, eight-seater chairlifts and even an 80-seat double decker cable car. And the scenery from these lifts should gladden the most jaded eyes. The Silvretta and Fimbabahn cable cars from Ischgl to Idalp rise steeply up wooded mountainsides, looking down over waterfalls and the occasional goat foraging at some improbable spot. At the top it's stunning. There is also the quirky geographical appeal of being able to ski to Switzerland, to a small enclave of pretty blue runs, a restaurant by the Sattel peak whose terrace has a memorable view over vertiginous valleys, and even some duty free shopping. Apparently, customs officers will sometimes be waiting to check the purchases at the chairlift that marks the border, though none were in evidence when I was there. We were only able to access about half of the runs with November's snowfalls, but even that offered more than enough skiing possibilities to make anyone think twice about pursuing Ischgl's nightlife to the point of jeopardising the next day on the pistes. Or indeed, to keep happy skiers who might simply find the apres scene not for them. As one of the skiers on ifyouski.com's excellent resort survey says, \"Ischgl is a great place. But... it is the Ibiza of the Alps - and that is NOT a compliment.\" Where to eat On the slopes, there's a good variety of mountain restaurants from pizzerias to more traditional farmhouse food. The Panorama in Idalp is very busy at lunchtimes but spruces up at nighttime. It's Germanic cuisine: unless you demand otherwise, expect a lot of pig-based meals. Back in the resort, the choice ranges from chic cafes that look more typically urban than Alpine, to hotel restaurants. The Solaria was good, but the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me is the Trofana's Paznauner Stube, run by celebrity chef Martin Sieberer - a degustation menu comes in at \u20ac195 (including different wines with each course). Where to go out You're unlikely to find a quiet spot around the bottom of the runs back to Ischgl, whether it's driving Euro beats or oompah that you prefer. It can't get much kitscher than the Schatzi, in the Elizabeth hotel - upstairs, the Ice Bar is allegedly cooler. For (arguably) more sophistication, try Pacha - twin of the Ibizan superclub - in the Hotel Madlein. Lots of model types - mainly Hungarian dancers, according to the locals - dot the dancefloor in matching white outfits and stilettos. Adventurous German-speaking singles (or indeed couples - this is Austria) can apparently arrange rendezvous via the website Ischgllove.com. There's another surprisingly spacious nightclub, the Arena, underneath the Trofana hotel, with live bands and podium dancers. Or you can turn your back on the booze and try nighttime tobogganing on the 7km run from Idalp to Ischgl. (Rent toboggans from Silvretta Sports at the the Seilbahn mountain station). Where to stay There's a wide range of accommodation (tour operator Inghams alone offer 17 properties, ranging from two-star to luxury five-star hotels). I stayed at the Solaria, a convivial four-star near the centre of town, with such added bonuses as a sauna, steam room and swimming pool - and a squash court astonishingly located in the middle of the hotel behind the bar.
