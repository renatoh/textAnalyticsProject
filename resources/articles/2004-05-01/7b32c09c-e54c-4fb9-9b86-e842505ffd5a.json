Whereas nearby Cephalonia is the 'Captain Corelli island' - Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz were filming there a few years ago - Zakynthos (also known as Zante) is very much the turtle island. Its reptilian connection is celebrated everywhere, from turtle merchandise at the airport to turtle-themed days out and turtle-spotting trips in glass-bottomed boats. However, as my mum and I arrived at the airport for a short break in September, we knew the island's most famous residents, the endangered loggerhead turtles, would not be making our acquaintance. They are only in town - or, more precisely, in Laganas Bay - from June to August, when their egg-laying sojourn coincides with the arrival of package holidaymakers intent on living it up a Bacardi bottle's throw from the turtles' nesting zones. Our hotel, the Louis Zante Beach, overlooks the very beach where they nest; it is just a few hundred metres' walk to the turquoise waters where the turtles swim. Refurbished a couple of years ago, the Louis Beach is part of a 26-strong chain of hotels across Cyprus and Greece owned by the Louis group. The hotel staff are friendly and helpful; it's spotlessly clean and the setting is idyllic. But you can't help feeling that someone's been slightly generous with its 'A' category or five-star rating. There's a halls-of-residence feel to the strip-lighting in the lobbies, stairwells and lifts, the food is basic and the wine list is limited. But what Zakynthos lacks in sophisticated gastronomy it makes up for with its stunning coastline. Laganas Bay is both beautiful and serene, helped by the fact that it is strictly monitored by the National Marine Park of Zakynthos, an organisation on permanent turtle watch. Maintaining a balance between the needs of the turtles (who've been here for 90 million years) and those of the package tourists (who've not been around for quite so long) is an onerous task, but it's one that the National Marine Park and local businesses are desperate to make work - the beach doesn't permit water sports, is closed at night and is patrolled by wardens. Sitting on the beach just outside the hotel, it is easy to forget that the major tourist hotspot of Laganas is just a few minutes' walk away down a slightly treacherous unlit road, but ranks of tourists lured by the neon lights make the trek even outside the main tourist months. Laganas is much as you might expect - an unexceptional strip of karaoke bars, pubs, clubs and cash machines - but inland Zakynthos remains an arrestingly pretty island. It has had a colourful set of owners, having been passed from Alexander the Great to the Romans, all the way through to Napoleon. But it was the Venetians who, during a 300-year sojourn, made the biggest impression architecturally, earning the island the tag of the 'Venice of the south'. Tragically, a massive earthquake in 1953 destroyed almost all of the Venetian and Byzantine architecture - all that remains now are frescoes preserved in the town's museum. Mum and I got distracted from sightseeing in Zakynthos town by a haberdashery shop. The enthusiasm of the 83-year-old owner was inspiring enough, but we also unearthed a treasure trove of vintage-look fabrics, linen and tea towels on her dusty shelves. The owner had been proprietor of the shop since 1958 and I suspect we were probably two of only a handful of customers in recent times, but we emerged with two large beaded blinds and bags of assorted fabrics. However, there's more to a holiday than shopping and, like all good package tourists, mum and I signed up with our rep for an excursion. We chose the turtle boat excursion because, despite the creatures' absence, it promised a serene cruise around the smugglers' caves, one of the island's top tourist attractions. In practice, the turtle boat trip proved to be less an 'opportunity to float round the island taking in breathtaking sights', and more 'fill the boat to the rafters and drive like the clappers to a barbecue lunch'. There may have been no sea creatures to view at close quarters, but it was a chance to observe another species frequently featured in TV documentaries: the holiday rep. We counted six on our voyage, one of whom - a not very subtle cross between Joe Pasquale and Bobby Davro - seemed at odds with a sedate audience who looked faintly embarrassed by his commentary. The boat paused to allow a 'swimming opportunity' while a helpful rep used the microphone to remind 'ladies and gentlemen who cannot actually swim' to stay on board or to collect a rubber ring - otherwise we'd risk missing our all-inclusive barbecue lunch. In order to preserve our sanity, mum and I jumped ship when we stopped at the beautiful Mavratzi beach. Come Saturday, and changeover day, the scene at the airport was reminiscent of Hellish Holidays from Hell II, as queues of homeward-bound package holidaymakers snaked out into the heat of the midday sun. Zakynthos has charm, welcoming residents and beautiful beaches but it clearly faces a Herculean challenge in trying to reconcile the demands of package tourism with safeguarding its natural assets. For the turtles' sake, I hope it succeeds. Factfile Lucy Siegle travelled with Thomas Cook (08701 111111; www.thomascook.com).
