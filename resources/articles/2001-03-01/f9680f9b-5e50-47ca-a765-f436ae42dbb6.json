America's visceral dislike for involvement in overseas conflicts is reflected in the press, and in the steadfast refusal of the Bush administration to contemplate military intervention in the growing crisis. But Americans have no shortage of vivid information from the Macedonian border battleground. Paul Watson, staff writer for the Los Angeles Times, offers a chilling account from behind rebel lines, under artillery and small arms fire from Macedonian forces. Only three people in the village of Lavce, he says, remain unarmed: \"One is an English teacher, an ethnic Albanian man named Azem Bajrami, who looks oddly jaunty in his blue beret, with a dark coat draped over his shoulders. At 60, he can still do a quick, weaving sprint to dodge snipers' bullets. \"He did it Monday as bullets whistled overhead from Macedonian police positions about 200 yards from this mountain village, which until a week ago had 600 residents. The two others are the last ethnic Macedonian holdouts, too old and frail to get up and leave their farmhouse as their country slips closer to all-out war.\" Carlotta Gall of the New York Times, also dodging bullets in the rebel-held border region, reports the ominously gathering strength of the Albanian ethnic fighters: \"The rebels now have free run of six villages along the valley that rises to the snow covered mountains, known as Sar Planina, and the border with neighboring Kosovo. More troops were arriving all the time. \"Some were climbing over the steep mountain slopes and arriving in Selce, the rebel headquarters, to offer assistance or join the ranks of fighters. Many had left Tetovo, where the heavy military and police presence had frightened the ethnic Albanian population, and the close proximity of the rebels frightened the Macedonian Slav population. Many volunteers were arriving also from Kosovo and Albania.\" The same paper's Washington bureau makes plain the US administration's extreme reluctance to be drawn into the growing conflict: \"Bush administration and NATO officials said their strategy would be to lend support to Macedonia's weak military and young government with indirect help like NATO military information and financial aid and some high-level diplomatic visits. But involving any of the region's peacekeeping forces directly in fighting the Albanian rebels was out of the question for now.\" Kevin Cullen, the Boston Globe correspondent, reports from Skopje that Macedonian resentment against Nato is rising: \"Prime minister Ljubco Georgievski ...whose country feels NATO owes it a moral debt for allowing it to be used as the staging area for NATO's 1999 war against then-Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, has been unsparing in his criticism of the American and German armed forces that share responsibility for patrolling his country's border with Kosovo. \"'You cannot convince us that the chieftains of these gangs are unknown to your governments, nor can you persuade us that they cannot be stopped,' Georgievski said in comments directed at Washington and Berlin.\" The Washington Post reporter in the embattled city of Tetovo, R Jeffrey Smith, believes that the Macedonian forces will launch an all out offensive today: \"Some Western officials and local politicians fear the assault could start a swift descent into full-scale ethnic war in Macedonia, a former Yugoslav republic that has so far avoided the extended fighting that devastated Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo. \"If the offensive succeeds in forcing a retreat into Kosovo, the fighters could come into confrontation with US and other Nato peacekeepers deployed there to block infiltration into Macedonia. It is not clear how Nato troops would respond to a general retreat.\" What's going on? The fighting in Macedonia explained Talk about it Should Nato intervene?
