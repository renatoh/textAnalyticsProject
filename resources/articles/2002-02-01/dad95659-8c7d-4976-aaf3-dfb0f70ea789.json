Only a serious injury crisis would lead to the Yorkshire pace bowler's selection despite his fine form in the recent one-day series in India and Wednesday's international in Christchurch. Gough had opted out of the first part of the winter itinerary, the three-Test series in India, even though it had been made clear that players doing so would be excluded from the second phase of the winter programme in New Zealand. Graveney said: \"The players were offered a contract that encompassed two Test series in India and New Zealand. Darren decided he wanted a rest and that's up to him. Therefore the squads were chosen without him playing Test-match cricket. \"He is an important guy but we have to stick to decisions that we have made. There could be extreme circumstances with injuries or whatever - situations could change. \"But at the present stage I am happy to let Duncan [Fletcher] and Nasser [Hussain] get on with the cricket. Our situation hasn't changed, whatever speculation there has been.\" Gough would undoubtedly be a valuable addition to the Test squad, but the selectors had made it clear that they did not want senior players to be able to cherry-pick the tours they went on as this would be damaging to morale. Four of England's five seam bowlers in the Test squad in New Zealand - Matthew Hoggard, Andrew Flintoff, Craig White and Jimmy Ormond - all played in India while Andrew Caddick, having originally made himself available, was allowed to opt out because of post-September 11 security fears. A plan has been mooted, by Lord MacLaurin, the chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, that would allow players to miss tours because of the relentless schedule of international cricket. The number of players contracted to the ECB - currently 12 during the summer and up to 16 for winter tours - would be increased to make opt-outs possible. The head of world cricket's anti-corruption unit, Lord Condon, said yesterday he believes the international game is on target for a corruption-free World Cup in 12 months' time. Lord Condon, the director of the International Cricket Council anti-corruption unit, said at a press conference: \"I am very confident that the measures being put in place in South Africa and around the cricket world will ensure that the World Cup will be a tournament played entirely on merit. \"There will be a sensible but stringent security regime in place, which will act as a major deterrent to would-be corrupters.\" \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
