The 21-year-old right-back is expected to join imminently in a deal that with add-ons may push the final price to around \u00a350m. Solskj\u00e6r has already added Daniel James, also 21, to his squad, the winger arriving from Swansea for \u00a315m this month. Palace have not managed to amend or have removed the 20% sell-on clause in the deal that took Wilfried Zaha back to the club from United in the summer of 2015. United have also not agreed to any sell-on clause in the terms of Wan-Bissaka\u2019s transfer. Wan-Bissaka, like James, is fast and has a rawness the manager hopes to mould as he bids to drive United forward next season. The right-back has not yet made 50 Premier League appearances and was in Aidy Boothroyd\u2019s England Under-21 squad that failed to win a game at the European Championship currently underway in Italy. Solskj\u00e6r is still thought to be targeting several positions, including a centre-back \u2013 Harry Maguire is in the frame \u2013 a full-back, a midfielder and a striker. Paul Pogba and Romelu Lukaku both wish to depart and it may be that the Norwegian has to generate funds from the sales of the pair \u2013 or others \u2013 before being able to make further, substantial outlays this summer. Lukaku favours a move to Internazionale, with the Italian club hoping to secure a deal for the striker, who wants the move, before United\u2019s pre-season tour of Australia and east Asia. Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s squad is due to fly to Perth on 7 July. Meanwhile, discussions are continuing between the club and David de Gea regarding fresh terms but there is frustration among the hierarchy due to a lack of a breakthrough. The Spaniard\u2019s current deal expires in 12 months after United were forced to trigger the one-year extension clause to prevent him walking away for free this summer. While United are intent on signing De Gea for the long term, they may be forced to sell him before the close of the transfer window on 8 August. If they do not and the 28-year-old does not agree a new contract, the club face the prospect of receiving no fee for a goalkeeper who is rated among the world\u2019s finest and could otherwise command a sum in the region of \u00a375m. Injuries permitting, Solskj\u00e6r will have his entire squad available for the upcoming tour, apart from Alexis S\u00e1nchez who is at the Copa America with Chile."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
