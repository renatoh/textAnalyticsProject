Lionel Messi\u2019s fired in a spectacular solo goal to put the visitors ahead shortly before Gerard Piqu\u00e9 doubled their lead with a tap-in. Luuk de Jong struck a late consolation. Marek Hamsik\u2019s early strike set Napoli on their way to a victory over Red Star Belgrade that kept the Italians top of Group C. Dries Mertens added a goal either side of half-time in a 3-1 win, Mohamed Ben Nabouhane scoring for the visitors. \u201cWe need to play well and win at Anfield, it\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d said Napoli coach, Carlo Ancelotti, whose side will go through if they avoid defeat. \u201cThe truth is that we\u2019re top of the group which nobody would have believed at the start.\u201d \u201cThis team gives me a lot of excitement, which I have not felt for more than two years, and when you feel emotion you can work better. I feel Neapolitan inside.\u201d A year after elimination at the group stage, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid qualified for the knockout phase by defeating Thierry Henry\u2019s Monaco 2-0. Koke opened the scoring in the third minute after his deflected shot fooled the goalkeeper, before Antoine Griezmann added to the lead. Radamel Falcao, a second-half substitute, sent a late penalty wide. \u201cIt\u2019s a relief and a shame at the same time,\u201d said Henry of their failure to even make the Europa League. \u201cWe still have the game against Dortmund, but our real battle is against Montpellier and what comes after that.\u201d Borussia Dortmund secured their progress from Group A later on with a goalless draw against Club Brugge. Goals from Grzegorz Krychowiak and Vladislav Ignatyev were enough for Lokomotiv Moscow to earn a 2-0 win over Galatasaray in Group D, ending Galatasary\u2019s hopes of qualifying for the knockout stages and sending both Porto and Schalke through to the last 16 before the two sides met in Portugal. In the event, the hosts prevailed 2-1 with goals from \u00c9der Milit\u00e3o, Jes\u00fas Manuel Corona and Moussa Marega making the win safe despite Nabil Bentaleb\u2019s last-minute penalty."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
