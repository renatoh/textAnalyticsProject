He's told, \"At least it's dry up there.\" There are more profound reasons why Nasa is planning to revisit the moon; a whole tangle of reasons. This soundless, airless, waterless stone has compelling power over human life. The moon has always provoked worship and fear; moonlight is for lovers and vampires, for the living and the undead. It played a great role in social life before gas and electricity came along. Why were card-playing, and particularly blackjack, so popular in the 18th century? Because you could read the value of a playing card, as you could not the printed lines on a book, by moonlight. Fortunes were won and lost by moonlight. It's different now. No more sentimental nonsense about moonlight becoming you because it goes with your hair, as Bing Crosby once claimed. The moon has entered the orbit of politics. It was John F Kennedy in the mid-60s who decided that men should walk on the moon, claiming it for all mankind - except for the denizens of the USSR and those dreadful people who lived on the wrong side of the world. The US needed cheering up after the Bay of Pigs disaster. Now, once more, the US needs cheering up after 9/11 and the ecodisaster of New Orleans and its hinterlands. So they are going again. That's great! We'll all watch on television. And remember, we may all have to live up there one day when global warming gets a real grip here below. The successful Apollo programme was in part designed in rivalry with the Russians. It was a tremendous technical achievement, considering that the astronauts still wore analogue watches, while their computer power was equivalent to the power in your mobile phone. Possibly there is now a suspicion that the US may be in rivalry with the Chinese. Technology has advanced rapidly since the heady days that ended with the closure of the man-on-the-moon programme in 1972. As it was then just achievable to land men on the lunar surface, so now it is just possible to get a man, or men, or men and women, to Mars. If there is something tired and inward-looking about returning to the moon, so there would be something forward-looking and inspiring about a landing on Mars. We know well how to get to Mars; the problem is getting back. We anticipate finding no life on Mars, except possibly bacterial life, with which it would be difficult to hold a rational conversation. But it is rational to suppose that Mars could become a stepping stone to the outer planets, to those mysterious moons of Jupiter and Saturn, and beyond them to the Pluto-Charon twins and the mysterious new Planet X, out in the distant Kuiper belt. As yet, such explorations lie within the realms of science fiction; but so for many a year did the crazy notion that men might walk on the moon. A thing must be imagined before it can be achieved. The trouble with returning to the moon is that it has been done. But let's not be superior; the Americans have done it; so far, we, the British, have not ventured much farther than the troposphere. Many scientists believe that the moon is the begetter of life on earth, its shallow tides, millennia ago, permitting primitive life to survive out of the sea into the air. It is possible that on the moons of Jupiter a more spiritual humanity might evolve. Meanwhile, we continue with our cakes and ale, and our terrestrial alarms, and wish Nasa many happy returns to the moon \u00b7 Brian Aldiss OBE is the author of Sanity and the Lady (PS Publications) in bookshops now. Brian Aldiss Sir Alan Sugar's subsensory face-fixer Sir Alan Sugar and his \"apprentice\" Tim Campbell invite me to the launch of Amstrad's latest innovation within the health and beauty industry. (The company has branched out since the days of the computer.) It is Campbell's first project since winning The Apprentice and under Sugar's watchful eye, he has developed a product called Integra, which applies electricity to the face to \"improve circulation and muscle relaxation by varying the shapes of the impulses or waveforms\". In the press release, \"waveforms\" appears in italics, which I take to mean that it mightn't be universally recognised by physicists. Still, it is an opportunity to meet Sir Alan. The 58-year-old entrepreneur is not known for his love of journalists. But the sun is shining, there are pastries on the table and a phalanx of PRs flutter around with the excitement that only the job of promoting a hydro-vitality infusion complex with the former chairman of Tottenham Hotspur can bring. \"Hello!\" I say, as we'll settle into our seats. \"The Apprentice has been fantastically successful. I wonder if you had any -\" \"Sorry,\" snaps Sir Alan. \"What is this interview about?\" In the corner, David the PR looks reluctantly up. \"It's an interview with the Guardian, Sir Alan.\" \"Can you let me know what it's about? What the Guardian think it's about.\" \"It's about what Sir Alan and Tim have been launching today. Essentially, that's what it's about. I know it's part of a wider ...\" He trails off. Getting to the heart of the matter, I ask Sir Alan if he could explain what today is about. \"Tim won The Apprentice, and he was given the job of developing the new healthcare product. He's done very well. He's a great bloke. Good choice.\" Sir Alan would also like to use today to urge people to buy the Integra Total Facial System through the Sir Alan Sugar Enterprise Scheme (SASES). This is a business opportunity which allows you to earn extra income from the comfort of your own home with absolutely NO RISK. (In the press release, NO RISK appears in capital letters, which I take to mean that it mightn't be universally recognised by logical philosophers). Sir Alan is not surprised by the way his life has turned out. \"I have confidence in me, and it wouldn't matter if you took everything away - I would get back there.\" He doesn't have much time for MBAs or degree students. \"Doctors and scientists, some engineers, really have no concept of the real world and need to let someone else worry about it.\" Soon after, Sir Alan leaves the room. Outside in the corridor, David the PR gnaws on a chocolate biscuit. \"Got everything you need?\" he says. \"Sir Alan talks so fast that you actually get a lot more than you've realised.\" Which is rather how Integra works. I see in the press release that the beauty of micro-currents is that they are transmitted \"on a subsensory level\". So you can't actually feel anything happening. Emma Brockes My campaign for Cliff Is Sir Cliff Richard giving up recording new material? Reports yesterday suggested he was, because UK radio stations have a policy of not playing his music. \"I don't want to go to all the effort of putting something together,\" he said, \"if people won't even give it a chance.\" Sir Cliff's management cannot immediately tell us precisely how many stations we would have to get back on side before he will reconsider, but it is obvious there is no time to waste. A call to Champion 103 in Bangor confirms our fears: Cliff Richard is not on its menu. \"We play Welsh-language music,\" says the man at the other end, although 103's home page proclaims that it is currently playing Linger by the Cranberries. So if Sir Cliff recorded a song in Welsh, they would play it? He says someone will get back to me. \"I'm not a mad Cliff Richard fan, to be honest,\" says DJ Tony Blackburn, who nevertheless rebelled against Classic Gold's no-Cliff policy last summer, playing three songs in a row and earning himself a one-day suspension. \"I thought it was just stupid from our point of view because, basically, he's got such a big fan base.\" The resulting publicity led to a reversal of policy at Classic, where Richard's music is now welcome. But there's a problem: Classic is an oldies' station. They don't play new releases. A number of stations seem strangely reluctant to admit to a policy on Cliff. This could be because they simply don't know if they have one or not. But one also gets the feeling the subject just doesn't come up that often. Richard Grant, of Fen Radio 107.5, says, \"We are a rock station, so if he puts out a rock track, we play it.\" This seems as close to a solid promise as we're going to get, but there's even better news from Saga radio: \"We have 61 of his songs on our playlist,\" says programme director Paul Robey. One can almost feel the ground beginning to swell. We have mapped out a basic strategy for Sir Cliff - he must only record hard rock songs, in Welsh - by the time his management rings back. \"They've got it wrong,\" says his spokesman, Bill Latham. \"He's not ending his recording career. In fact, he's in the studio today.\" Oh, well, thanks for letting us know. Is it too early to start a backlash? Tim Dowling"}, "isHosted": false}}}
