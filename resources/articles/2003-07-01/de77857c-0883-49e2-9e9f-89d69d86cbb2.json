Running for the first time since his success in the Geoffrey Freer Stakes at the same course last August, Mubtaker grabbed the lead with two furlongs to run and galloped on strongly to beat Parasol by one and a half lengths. Mubtaker is now a six-year-old, but he has raced just 14 times, and now has six victories to his name. \"He is an incredibly tough horse who is very lightly-raced because he has had so many small problems,\" Marcus Tregoning, his trainer, said. \"His best trip is somewhere between one and two miles, he definitely stays a mile and five and there is no reason why he won't get further. \"We have given him an entry in the Melbourne Cup and he might just be the right type of horse for the race. The ground ought to be in his favour there.\" Definite Guest, who beat the heavily-backed favourite Unshakable in the Ladbrokes.com Handicap on the same card, will now be trained for the Cambridgeshire Handicap at Newmarket in October. Matloob, who the juvenile conditions event for Michael Jarvis's in-form stable, looks sure to hold his own in Pattern company later in the season. He beat Naaddey by almost two lengths to earn a quote of 33-1 from Ladbrokes for next year's 2,000 Guineas. At Newmarket, Treble Heights, who is owned by Michael Owen, the Liverpool and England striker, battled on well to beat New Orchid by a head in the Aphrodite Stakes, and will now run in either the Park Hill Stakes at Doncaster or the Prix de Pomone at Deauville."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
