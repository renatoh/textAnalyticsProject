The straw poll didn't include Perry, though he's had supporters on the ground for weeks pushing Iowa voters to write his name in, anyway \u2013 and quite a few did. The big loser was clearly former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty, who's tried for nearly two years to gain a solid footing in Iowa \u2013 to no avail. Out of juice, and practically penniless, Pawlenty said Friday that if he failed to do well, he would have to reassess his campaign \u2013 and given his third place finish, his withdrawal from the GOP race may be imminent. Another big loser \u2013 more expected than Pawlenty \u2013 was Herman Cain, in fifth place, who's been a constant surprise to commentators, and to his fellow candidates \u2013 ever since he walked off with the first GOP debate in New Hampshire. Cain has demonstrated an uncanny ability to rally straw poll voters in lesser-known polls, including victories in Georgia and Washington State earlier this year. And no one has scored higher on the \"positive intensity\"scale among GOP voters than than the former pizza magnate who once went head-to-head with Bill Clinton as a questioner during a televised town hall debate, and came away the victor. But if Cain's star has fallen \u2013 in part, due to the rise of Bachmann, but also to his own campaign gaffes and missteps \u2013 it hasn't left the field wanting for unexpected upstarts. This time, it's Ron Paul, the party's quadrennial gadfly, and die-hard libertarian, who's evolved into something of a \"gray eminence\" as the GOP's own domestic and foreign policy stances have started to resemble his own. The Tea Party surge has largely vindicated Paul's longstanding attacks on \"big government\", and his neo-isolationist foreign policy, which once caused him to be tarred and feathered as a closet leftist, is now extolled by top GOP leaders, and has even coloured the views of other GOP candidates, including Bachmann and Mitt Romney. While so much attention has focused on Perry of late, Paul has come out of nowhere to join the ranks of second tier candidates even surpassing Sarah Palin's 12% in the latest national poll \u2013 and now running Bachmann a very close second in the Iowa straw poll. Does anyone think Paul is electable? Certainly not. And even his strong showing in Iowa probably won't mean much in the end. Except that it's a sign of the continuing discontent in Republican voter ranks over the state of the GOP field, notwithstanding the high hopes surrounding Perry's late entry. Paul exudes a sincerity, simplicity and clarity on the issues \u2013 and a sense of compassion \u2013 that no other GOP candidate seems to match, which makes him, if not a voice of reason and conscience, at least a striking counterpoint to the increasingly rage-filled ranks of his party. Where does the race go from here? History shows that the winner of the Iowa straw poll doesn't necessarily win the Iowa caucuses, as Romney discovered in 2008, when a certain Arkansas governor, who finished second to him in the straw poll, later rode a wave of evangelical voter unrest to victory in the caucuses. But Bachmann's victory Saturday was a huge win for her. It comes on the heels of a fierce, if largely underhand, media campaign stoked by her GOP rivals to try to discredit her candidacy, beginning with a scandalous article in the conservative Daily Caller calling into question her mental and physical health \u2013 and \"fitness\" for high office \u2013 based almost exclusively on the fact that she suffers from sometimes debilitating migraines \u2013 and culminating more recently with a widely criticised Newsweek cover photo that portrayed her as a wild-eyed \"Rage Queen\". Despite the best efforts of the punditocracy to suggest that Perry is about to take the entire GOP field by storm, the evidence strongly suggests otherwise. His surge in the polls has exposed the softness of Romney's frontrunner status but does not appear to place him in a position to displace the former Massachusetts governor, who still has a commanding lead in fundraising and political organisation. Perry did just capture the polling lead in Virginia, but Romney has a strong hold on Nevada, Michigan, Florida \u2013 and, of course, New Hampshire, probably the more important of the early primary contests. And though Bachmann has suffered somewhat in recent polls that have also included Perry, once Sarah Palin's name is removed from the list, she's back even with Romney and Perry. The upshot? In place of two top contenders, Republicans now have three. But even that alignment may not last for long. Rumour has it that former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani is quietly building a campaign organisation in New Hampshire and will soon join the race. Rudy, the iconic hero of 9/11, was on television recently to defend the GOP's approach to the debt ceiling crisis, and went out of his way to say he considered himself \"the most experienced and accomplished Republican candidate\" and the one best able to beat Obama. The latest CNN poll agrees: he has a six-point lead in a head-to-head contest with Obama, while Perry is five points behind. As another venerable New Yorker, Yankee baseball catcher Yogi Berra, once said: \"It ain't over 'til it's over.\" He was referring to how quickly fortunes could shift, late in the game, in a single inning of a baseball game. But this year's GOP game \u2013 at Iowa, it seemed more like a carnival \u2013 is just getting warmed up."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
