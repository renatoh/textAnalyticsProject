The strong rumour is that Ivanka Trump, the daughter of Donald Trump, is coming to town. \u201cAll we need now is to hear that her dad is coming too,\u201d joked the town\u2019s mayor, Emilio Romani. And if the chattering in the Italian press is to be believed, that prospect may be likelier than he imagines. It has been suggested that the US president could accompany his 35-year-old daughter to the wedding of a New York couple, which is believed to be taking place at Santo Stefano castle, perched on the edge of the town\u2019s beach, towards the end of the month. Puglia, and the region of Salento in particular, has been a coveted tourist destination for several years. This summer, however, the celebrity quotient has reached new levels. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, and his wife Brigitte are expected to spend their summer break in a region which was once overlooked by the rich and famous in favour of swankier Capri, or Porto Cervo in Sardinia. Ivanka is already a fan of Puglia, having visited Alberobello \u2013 a town famed for its cone-shaped trullo houses \u2013 with her husband, Jared Kushner, and their children in 2015. She has reportedly booked to stay in a masseria, or fortified farmhouse, in the countryside. But amid the flurry of anticipation, Romani is taking the possible arrival of the Trump entourage in his stride, despite the security obligations he may have to fulfil. Monopoli is used to hosting VIP guests, he said, citing the June nuptials in the town\u2019s cathedral of Manuel Neuer, a goalkeeper for Bayern Munich and Germany\u2019s national team, and his bride, Nina Weiss. The British pop group Duran Duran also performed at a concert at the castle a few years ago. \u201cWhether it\u2019s only Trump\u2019s daughter or both of them, it would be a brilliant thing,\u201d Romani said. \u201cEveryone has their different opinions about politics, but local people see the value of such a visit; it gives Monopoli some limelight,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, Ostuni, a medieval town located further south, is expected to welcome the actor Tom Hanks, while Madonna is also due to return to the Salento region after holidaying there last summer. \u201cIt was very satisfying to have Madonna here last year, but what\u2019s even more satisfying is that she\u2019s coming back,\u201d said Francesco Caizzi, president of the Bari division of Federalberghi, the Italian hotel association. \u201cWhen people come to Puglia, they fall in love with it,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful region, where the people are very welcoming. When these big personalities visit, they are looking to experience simple traditions, whether it\u2019s seeing old people chatting in a square or pasta being made by hand.\u201d One person who fell for Puglia\u2019s charms is the Oscar-winning actress Helen Mirren, who years ago bought a masseria in the south of Salento, where she grows pomegranates. She fondly describes herself as the contadina salentina, or the \u201cSalento peasant woman\u201d, and has even got behind a local campaign to save some of the region\u2019s centuries-old olive trees, infected by the Xylella fastidiosa bacterium, from destruction. People are particularly drawn to fortified farmhouses, Caizzi said. Many of them have been turned into hotels. \u201cThey find silence, something far removed from what they are used to.\u201d Celebrities aside, Puglia is also popular among ordinary Italians from the north of the country for its good weather, uncrowded beaches, pristine waters, rich history and mouthwatering food. \u201cIt\u2019s a little difficult to reach, but lots of people want to see it,\u201d Caizzi said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had mass tourism like in other places. They come here for beaches, people, food and tranquillity \u2026 We do have places where there is nightlife, but we are not Ibiza or Formentera.\u201d Another big draw is the region\u2019s low prices, especially compared with the Amalfi coast \u2013 where Ivanka\u2019s younger half-sister, Tiffany, recently spent a yachting holiday \u2013 and parts of Sardinia, which has some of the world\u2019s best beaches and has long been a celebrity haven. Puglia may be steadily attracting some big names, but it has no desire to become overly associated with celebrity culture. \u201cSardinia\u2019s Costa Smeralda is very identifiable as a place for VIPs,\u201d said Caizzi. \u201cBut we want to be a destination for everyone. People here are not so interested in VIPs; nor do they care to know what is happening in their lives.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
