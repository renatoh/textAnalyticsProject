Central government shelled out nearly \u00a31 billion and other public-sector bodies a further \u00a3300 million out of a total of \u00a36bn spent with MCA members in 2003. The overall UK consultancy market is put at \u00a310bn by the MCA. However, the MCA does not represent some of the top strategy consultants, such as McKinsey, whose services central government and other public bodies also used last year. So final official totals could be much higher. Driven by the public service improvement agenda, 'growth in public-sector consulting far outstripped that of any major area of the economy', says the MCA. While central government was the biggest public consultancy buyer, the NHS bought \u00a325m worth of advice from MCA members last year, a 185 per cent rise over 2002, while income from defence soared from \u00a342m to \u00a383m. About half the public-sector total was spending on consultancy related to four big contracts awarded by the Department of Work and Pensions, Transport for London, Inland Revenue and the NHS. Public-sector clients were also the main purchasers of business process re-engineering, e-business, marketing and strategy, says the report."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
