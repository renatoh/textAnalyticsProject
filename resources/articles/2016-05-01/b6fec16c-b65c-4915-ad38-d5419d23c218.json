Writing in the Radio Times about the parallel lives and growing rivalry between the prime minister and former mayor of London, Crick said Cameron told journalists the revealing anecdote at a Westminster garden party last year. He wrote: \u201cEarlier that week, Cameron explained, the pair had sat facing each other in the cabinet room, with Johnson outlining his plans for London and requests for help. \u201cThen, as Cameron started responding, with help from a sheaf of briefing papers, Johnson leant across the table. \u2018What\u2019s all this? Let\u2019s see!\u2019 he cried as he tried to snatch the documents from the PM\u2019s grasp. \u201cCameron held on to his precious notes, and for a few moments the two Conservative politicians wrestled and tugged for supremacy across the cabinet table, like a couple of immature schoolboys. Officials looked on in astonishment. It was hugely undignified, yet hugely symbolic.\u201d Both Cameron and Boris attended Eton and were members of the Bullingdon club at Oxford. However, while Johnson initially backed Cameron in his bid to become party leader, he has quickly become seen as one of the main rivals to Cameron\u2019s leadership of the Conservative party. Johnson\u2019s backing for the campaign to leave the EU has brought the rivalry more firmly into the public eye, with Crick repeating suspicions among many, including former conservative minister Ken Clarke, that Johnson\u2019s support of Brexit is \u201ca deliberate ploy both to destabilise Cameron, and reinforce his position as darling of the grassroots when the PM calls it a day\u201d. Crick had a run-in with Johnson while broadcasting from a Vote Leave rally last month when Johnson told supporters to interrupt a Channel 4 broadcast in scenes reminiscent of the hostile attitude towards the media at Donald Trump rallies. Though one of the attendees approached Crick and asked him to stop recording while placing himself in front of the camera, the Channel 4 reporter later defended Johnson on social media, saying it was unfair to compare him to the controversial presidential candidate and that Johnson was a \u201cvery media-friendly politician\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
