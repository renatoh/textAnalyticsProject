I\u2019d love to have mini-makars. I\u2019d give them this line to do and that commission, because there isn\u2019t really enough of you to do everything you\u2019re asked. It\u2019s just not possible. I\u2019m only the one makar.\u201d Luckily this makar, the third since the position was established by the Scottish parliament in 2004, has found time to meet up in the lobby of a Manchester hotel, prior to an appearance at the city\u2019s literary festival, and compare notes with another eminent national bard. Tracy K Smith is the 22nd poet laureate of the United States and the fourth woman of colour to occupy the role. Her second and final term has just ended \u2013 she will be succeeded by the Native American poet Joy Harjo \u2013 but she has plenty to discuss with Kay about the satisfactions and scarier aspects of the job. Last month, Smith, 47, published Eternity, a selection of work from her four books of poetry to date, beginning with The Body\u2019s Question in 2003 and including the Pulitzer prize-winning Life on Mars (2011), which explored sci-fi, astrophysics and the celestial nature of David Bowie. Smith was born in Massachusetts and raised in Fairfield, California, by an engineer father and a schoolteacher mother who both grew up in Alabama during the civil rights era. Reflections on race and slavery surface throughout her work, alongside meditations on desire, loss and the eternal. Kay, 10 years Smith\u2019s senior, is one of the UK\u2019s best-loved poets. Born to a Scottish mother and a Nigerian father in Edinburgh, she was adopted by a white Scottish couple and raised in a suburb of Glasgow. She has written numerous volumes of poetry since The Adoption Papers in 1991 \u2013 tackling subjects as diverse as sexuality, jazz and Nigel Farage \u2013 as well as a novel, children\u2019s books and a memoir, Red Dust Road, which movingly recounts her search for her biological parents. The two women have never met before, but each has clearly immersed themselves in the other\u2019s writing. \u201cBefore I even came today, I felt like I\u2019d already had a conversation with you, through our work,\u201d says Kay at one point. Both strongly believe in poetry as a means of fostering empathy by inhabiting different characters and different selves. \u201cIn a way I think of your work as a great opera of voices,\u201d Kay tells Smith. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like you\u2019re saying that all of these human beings come through us, that we\u2019re not one person, we\u2019re many.\u201d The two poets need very little prompting to get started and the conversation flows so freely that it\u2019s difficult to get a word in edgeways. Kay speaks in a headlong, ebullient way, taking great pleasure in impersonations as she recalls her travels around Scotland as makar. Smith, currently a professor of creative writing at Princeton, is a touch less animated, weighing her words carefully, but she expresses herself with feeling throughout, not least when talk turns to the necessity of poetry in the age of Trump. Let\u2019s start by talking about being a poet laureate \u2013 or makar in Jackie\u2019s case. What\u2019s the experience been like for each of you? JK It\u2019s a huge honour and a huge surprise to be picked as the national poet, particularly if you had an ambivalent relationship with your country for some of your life. Lots of different things come along with it. I wrote a poem for the opening of the Scottish parliament three years ago and the Queen was there, and the whole of the parliament, and my mum and dad \u2013 my dad, who\u2019d fought as the Communist party candidate for years, said: \u201cI\u2019ve made it at last, I\u2019ve finally got in!\u201d I\u2019ve just written a poem to celebrate 20 years of Scottish devolution that\u2019s multi-voiced, because I see my role \u2013 and I think we have a lot in common in this way \u2013 as not just representing my own voice but the voices you don\u2019t get to hear from. What about you? What was it like when you were asked? TKS I was honoured and grateful, but also scared because I\u2019d seen so many poets laureate do amazing outreach work and I asked myself, what could I do that they haven\u2019t already done? But then I started thinking about how our national discourse in the US has become so splintered, with such division and intolerance across different perspectives, and I thought, poetry is good medicine for that, it\u2019s something that makes everyone a little bit more attentive. What\u2019s been so exciting to me is going into spaces where there are people who say, \u201cOh I\u2019ve always been bad at poetry\u201d, and I say, \u201cNo, this is our original language. We lived in images and metaphor and associations and dreams until it was taught that we should be thinking otherwise, and what we are doing together now is restoring something that we ought to claim.\u201d Are you reaching audiences that you wouldn\u2019t otherwise have reached? TKS In literal terms, yes. I\u2019ve been going to places where someone from a coastal city, from a university environment, might not ordinarily be invited into. I\u2019ve been to a lot of southern and rural communities, where community is divided along the lines of race, and I\u2019ve spoken to people who are black who say, \u201cI want my daughter here, to see someone who looks like her doing something like this\u201d, and people who are white saying, \u201cI drove two hours to bring my kids here because we live in a community where things are really divided and I want them to know that\u2019s not the way the world should be.\u201d JK Never underestimate how powerful that is. On a broader scale, I think poetry has the potential to heal some of these divides. If you look at the difficulties in the world at the moment, the answers to some of those difficulties are creative. People are coming in droves to poetry readings all over, because they feel like they need some answers. Poetry provides some of these answers because it\u2019s not a polemic and it speaks to the different losses, divides, uncertainties and fragilities that people carry within them. In these very uncertain times, poetry is community, poetry is soul, it\u2019s the language of being human, it finds a way to reach across. Have your duties as makar taken you to interesting places? JK It\u2019s been extraordinary going to some really remote parts of Scotland, because you get a real sense of your country changing. I went to an island in the Outer Hebrides, Uist, and at the reading I looked out into the audience and saw a lot of lesbians, and I was amazed \u2013 the Outer Hebrides! I mentioned this to the woman who was driving me around the next day, and without missing a beat she said: \u201cAye, we managed to hang on to our lesbians. We lose our gay men though\u2026\u201d A sentence like that was unthinkable even five years ago in Scotland. You\u2019ve both written memoirs [Kay published Red Dust Road in 2011, Smith\u2019s Ordinary Light came out in 2015]. How did that compare to writing poetry? TKS I felt like I was learning to walk again. I really wanted to write about my mother [Kathryn, who died in 1994] and that sense of early loss in prose, rather than poetry, but once I sat down to do that, it was terrifying. It was only through that process that I came to realise my story wasn\u2019t just about the death of a parent, but about growing up black in suburban northern California in the 70s and 80s, where race wasn\u2019t something that we had a vocabulary for discussing outside of my home. And then I became aware of all of the ways I\u2019d avoided hearing my parents\u2019 stories about the hardships they\u2019d endured growing up in the segregated south, because those things hurt me. Writing the book allowed me to acknowledge that, and I think it opened up the space for the poems that I wrote in Wade in the Water. JK I found writing Red Dust Road frightening, too. And even though The Adoption Papers was autobiographical, it felt very different, because in a poem you can jump, you can hide behind things and go from the general to the universal quite quickly, and you can say, \u201cWell, that wasn\u2019t really me.\u201d TKS \u201cThat was the speaker\u2026\u201d JK Whereas in a memoir, there is no hiding place, and I found that very difficult for lots of reasons. Ethically, what was my right to write about these people who were still alive? Can I say things they\u2019d be uncomfortable with? The other thing I had to confront was loss. Only when I was writing Red Dust Road did I realise that the loss from having been separated from my original mother was a loss that I carry around with me. It was an uncomfortable thing to confront, but it felt like it would move me on in terms of whatever I tried to write next, and also as a person in my life. Because we run from loss, but actually we\u2019re made of absences and presences, and absences take up just as much space in our life as presences, they\u2019re sat right behind us, they go to bed with us. Absence is a palpable thing. We\u2019re taught to think that it\u2019s not, but anybody who has suffered any kind of grief knows that grief walks alongside you and you can\u2019t really escape it. TKS I was so moved by the passage in Red Dust Road where you are realising that your birth mother\u2019s sense of loss that emerges in Alzheimer\u2019s was always there, and that it was about having a child taken away. That was such a beautiful act of empathy. The conditions of our lives are so different and yet I felt that there\u2019s so many things that they share. JK I felt that too. I really appreciate the way that you write about loss. My mum and dad are 94 and 88 and I\u2019m living in this stage now of pre-grief. I have a double life: one minute I\u2019m donning the plastic gloves and being a carer and next minute I\u2019m walking out on to stage. It\u2019s kind of doing my head in, but I find reading these poems enormously comforting because you show the different ways in which you keep people with you. That love that you have for them is still in you, and in a sense they\u2019re still here. TKS I remember reading a Joseph Brodsky essay in college in which he wrote that at the heart of every poem is the desire not to give death the last word, even just in capturing a moment and holding it still until you can mine it. I thought to myself, this will be helpful to me one day, to realise that poems can do this. JK That\u2019s really amazing. TKS I have this idea that we are different selves. And there\u2019s something so beautiful about being drawn into that sense of largeness and community. JK That\u2019s what comes across in so much of your work, the idea of the large self, almost the Whitmanesque self of being large and containing multitudes. TKS Sometimes I think poetry is a way of defying [the limits of] one\u2019s own intelligence. For me, I don\u2019t understand physics, politics is hard for me, but poems allow me to find a construct by which this can become not only familiar, but intimate. Sometimes I describe my poems as thought experiments. I want to imagine being in the world in a better way: this poem can help me to make the better choice \u2013 to watch, listen, feel, connect, ask \u2013 than I have the wherewithal to make as a person. Do you feel your poems actually make you a better person? TKS I feel that my poems allow me to go upstairs to that better self, and to live by her courage and insight. And I get to dwell there and impart something, but then I come back downstairs and I\u2019m like: \u201cWhat are your socks doing over there?\u201d [laughs] JK I don\u2019t feel that my poems allow me to be a better person at all. I think maybe being a poet gives you a different way of listening to the beat of the world, and it lets you see the past and the present as a continuum, but I don\u2019t think it necessarily makes you a better or worse person. It\u2019s to do with your phrase, being awake \u2013 and I like the new use of the word \u201cwoke\u201d. It\u2019s one of those pieces of contemporary language that I actually really enjoy, the idea that, yes, we need to wake up, we need to watch what the world is doing and listen to our young people. We need to care about the world in the way that these young people are caring about the world, and recognise some of our mistakes and see that we\u2019ve got urgent things to deal with, and that we need to let our voices be heard. Poetry is increasingly popular, at least going by sales figures and levels of media interest. Is it because we\u2019re going through difficult times and people are turning to poetry for comfort? TKS I tend to think that poetry offers a necessary alternative vocabulary. Increasingly we are encouraged or even required to live in this vocabulary driven by the marketplace and technology, and so our terms for love and selfhood and friendship and work have been squeezed into these really flat, monetised words. Young people sometimes write to me and say: \u201cI\u2019m writing a book, I\u2019m trying to figure out how to brand myself and get followers.\u201d Those are not things that you want! Poetry takes us to the language of the deep self, and it also reminds us that other people matter. And it allows people to feel seen and heard, especially people of colour and communities that don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re being seen and heard on their terms. JK There\u2019s been a great democratisation of the world of poetry. In the past, it was seen as only certain kinds of people wrote poems, but now there isn\u2019t that same divide. There\u2019s all sorts of different forms: spoken-word poetry, Instagram poetry\u2026 Poets like Hollie McNish have taken off and are selling lots. But the average poet is not selling lots, that\u2019s a bit of a press distortion; poetry is only selling more for these internet sensations. If you look into the statistics in this country, the average poet sells fewer than 200 books. But it is exciting that these different voices are coming into the world of poetry and making it more varied, more various. There has been some heated debate around Insta-poetry and ideas of accessibility, whether poetry needs be difficult in order to be worthwhile. Where do you stand on that? TKS There are people who like to be gatekeepers, and that is an explanation for why poetry was made so difficult, unnecessarily, by certain modes of teaching. It means you\u2019ve climbed up and done the scholarship to be able to own something, so how can other people just walk up easily and own this thing? JK Exactly, and I really don\u2019t like it when somebody says poetry should be difficult and inaccessible, that you have to understand every classic form of poetry before you can write it. I agree with you that there are gatekeepers who want to keep people shut out. Those same people will say that fewer people should write poetry, not more, and they are actually writing articles saying that \u2013 there\u2019s been quite a few, not really naming names, but I would if I had a glass of wine\u2026 We met too early in the day\u2026 JK We did. But I find it really offensive actually. How dare you think that you can lock poetry up and call it yours? Poetry is bigger than that. Poetry doesn\u2019t belong to some wee white man. It belongs to all of time and it will go on ahead of you and behind you and it\u2019s not going to be kept. Poetry shouldn\u2019t be a zoo animal locked up in a cage, poetry should be out in the wild, whereas some people want to keep it locked up and feed it odd bits of meat and let it roar in their face. Did either of you come across gatekeepers when you were starting out as poets? JK Lots. If you\u2019re a black writer in any form, there\u2019s this attitude that you have to first of all prove you\u2019re any good. Every single black writer knows what that feels like. And it\u2019s really shocking. When Toni Morrison got given the Nobel prize, she said: \u201cI hope I\u2019m being given this for the right reasons.\u201d That really upset me. I thought, how sad that a writer of such phenomenal talent as Toni Morrison has to worry whether or not they\u2019ve given it to her because she\u2019s black. A white writer never has that worry. And when a black writer does get a prize, other writers, white writers, will say: \u201cOh, it\u2019s so hard for white writers these days.\u201d TKS Oh God\u2026 JK And it\u2019s the same with women writers. There is still a terrible prejudice out there against black writers, and people don\u2019t even check themselves. They\u2019ll read a black writer to see, is this any good? That\u2019s the first question they\u2019ll be asking. And the first answer in their head will be: \u201cThey can\u2019t really write.\u201d Any black writer has to get past that first and it\u2019s terribly depressing. People do it unconsciously, they don\u2019t even know that they\u2019re doing it. The poetry world is full of people that do that. As soon as any new voices come into the poetry world, you\u2019ll have a number of white writers who\u2019ll say: \u201cWell, I like them, they\u2019re a nice person, but they\u2019re not really any good.\u201d And they won\u2019t know that they\u2019re just doing that by default. That hasn\u2019t changed since you were starting out? JK No it hasn\u2019t. What\u2019s changed is people of colour getting more recognition, more prizes and more attention. But the default position in several parts of the literary white establishment is, \u201cYes, but they\u2019re not really any good\u201d, and that will take years and years to correct. Is there the same problem in the US? TKS It\u2019s definitely similar. One thing I will say is that American poetry has been revived and re-energised by the voices of writers of colour and immigrant communities, and publishing has visibly changed over the past two decades as a result of institutions such as Cave Canem, which began by hosting a summer retreat for black writers and sponsoring a first book contest, and has become a model for lots of other literary organisations. It\u2019s now patently clear that the best writing that\u2019s coming out of the States is from these places. There\u2019s been a great flourishing, and we see that the American language and the story of America is many, many different things. That makes me very happy. JK Take an American writer like Audre Lorde, who died in 1992, but is now experiencing a renaissance both here and in the States. She was a woman way ahead of her time. When she published The Black Unicorn in 1981, it got some critical attention, but she was never really taken seriously. And now she\u2019s being taken seriously, all of these years after her death. There have been so many writers from the States and Britain who were pioneering but didn\u2019t get the kind of sales or attention when they were alive. Does living under Trump change your dynamic in being a poet in the world, Tracy? How does Trump affect you personally? TKS It\u2019s changed the world I live in, and it\u2019s changed the questions and preoccupations I live with. As much as I want to feel that [Trump] isn\u2019t a governing presence for me as a writer, I\u2019m thinking about the fear, the hatred, the distance from clarity and reality that we live with now\u2026 I think this is a really good time for poetry. If anybody ever thought poetry was a luxury, that\u2019s gone. Poetry is a necessary remedy to a lot of the darkness we are subject to. JK Audre Lorde wrote this famous essay called Poetry Is Not a Luxury, and it\u2019s lovely that that phrase has come back\u2026 Yeah, it\u2019s strange because Trump has rejigged the notions of reality, and in a way poetry and writers need to get more real because there are different demands being placed on the writer in these times. Do you feel it\u2019s complacent, as a poet, to avoid looking at the world around you and what\u2019s going on in politics? JK You can\u2019t escape the world around you. Poetry comes out of the political world. You can choose to write any kind of poetry in response, it doesn\u2019t need to be polemical. But a poet who says that they\u2019re divorced from the politics of the world is deluded because, to speak plainly, we all live in the political world, we\u2019re all part of it, and why should poets be separate? My son used to ask me when he was wee: \u201cMummy, why are you always going to poetry?\u201d He thought poetry was a place. And for me, poetry is a place in the world, it\u2019s not like a space in your head. It\u2019s a place in the world, a place at the table, it\u2019s a physical thing. Can I bring the conversation back to where we started? As officially appointed national poets, have you ever felt uncomfortable or politically compromised by your position? TKS Well, the laureateship is a position that sits within the Library of Congress, it\u2019s not part of the executive branch of government. My position is supposed to sit at a remove from political discourse. In fact, as laureate I was discouraged from talking about policy. But poetry talks about the ways that everything touches us. And so it was really beautiful to say: \u201cOK, here\u2019s a poem, this speaker is talking about being a stranger in a place where no one recognises her. Let\u2019s talk about this.\u201d And inevitably someone will say: \u201cWell, this reminds me of when people immigrate to this country.\u201d Let\u2019s talk about that, but in human terms, as opposed to policy terms. There\u2019s very little that poetry doesn\u2019t reach, I would say there\u2019s nothing that poetry can\u2019t reach. JK Yes, I agree completely with that, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything that\u2019s made me feel uncomfortable, except that you have to step up a bit into a public role. Suddenly people recognise you in a different way from before, and you\u2019re not going incognito quite as much. And that comes with its own little responsibilities, but some of that is really lovely. Last Christmas, I went to throw change to a guy who was busking and he stopped singing and said: \u201cIt\u2019s the makar \u2013 Merry Christmas, makar!\u201d And the other day I was in a Marks &amp; Spencer in Glasgow and this woman said, \u201cIt\u2019s the makar \u2013 five-pound-off voucher for you, makar!\u201d Things like that are very beautiful but they do make you see that you\u2019ve got higher visibility, and therefore higher responsibility and a larger public voice. And you have to use that carefully because you can\u2019t suddenly be pronouncing on things irresponsibly. I take all those things quite seriously. And nobody gives you any lessons. You don\u2019t get any classes or workshops on how to be a national poet. \u2022 Bantam is Jackie Kay\u2019s most recent collection (Picador (\u00a39.99).
