Hemsedal, Norway's answer to Chamonix, would appear to fall neatly into the latter camp - until you get to Christopher Adams and Henriette Salvesen's chalet, that is. The couple, both architects, are well-versed in designing contemporary ski lodges, but none has been quite as uncompromisingly modernist as this. Hemsedal has seen nothing like it, and the controversy made it as far as the government. In a family obsessed by skiing - the couple's daughter Samantha, 25, represented Norway at the junior Olympics, while their sons Sebastian, 23, and Alexander, 18, spent most of their childhood on the slopes - it was inevitable that one day they'd build their own chalet. \"The idea was for this to be a family project,\" says Salvesen, \"and we went through lots of options - from four self-sufficient cubicles to this, which is essentially one big common space where we're all together.\" The chalet has a small entrance room for storing ski paraphernalia, and a huge, split-level living, dining and kitchen area. Monochrome portraits of the children flinging themselves down mountains at high speeds adorn the walls. Its narrow layout fulfilled the chalet's most important criterion which, Adams says, was to have all the main rooms facing the slopes: three compact, cabin-style bedrooms - each with a double bed and single bunk above - range along one side of a corridor leading off the dining space, while at the end is the master bedroom. On the opposite side of the corridor are two contemporary bathrooms; the one nearest the master bedroom contains a sauna. The chalet is made from concrete cast on site and oak, and finished in black-stained spruce. \"A planning law states we must use a high proportion of timber,\" says Adams. While concrete may not be a traditional choice, the spruce helps the building fit into its surroundings. \"We wanted to create a mountain atmosphere,\" says Salvesen. \"We didn't want something that felt urban.\" Yet the design still caused something of an outcry. Locally, the main sticking point was the flat roof. \"Norwegians dream of a conservative ski lodge with grass on the roof,\" says Adams. \"We knew it would be controversial,\" adds Salvesen, who admits that their drawings were deliberately left a little sketchy, and that the chalet wasn't finished exactly to the initial plans. Nationally, however, it ended up being the subject of a major debate. Salvesen appeared on radio and wrote pieces for a national newspaper to defend the design. \"We didn't think it would cause such a stir,\" she says. As a result, Norway's Ministry of the Environment set up courses \"for local authorities to learn about modern architecture\". \"We hope other people will benefit,\" says Salvesen. The objections delayed the build, so the couple were on site in -10C conditions and metres of snow. \"Ideally, it's best to start in the spring, be under roof by late autumn and fit out in winter,\" says Adams. But it was good preparation - the couple had to factor heavy snow loads and freezing temperatures into the design. \"When you go higher up, you have to calculate for this. The roof has to be able to take three metres of snow,\" says Adams. To withstand winter temperatures that can drop as low as -20C, the building is highly insulated, and heating is a mixture of underfloor, operated remotely, and wood-burning stoves. With Alexander about to start university and the arrival of their first grandchild, the couple envisage the chalet playing a pivotal role in their changing family life. \"A second home has a different function from your first: it is a place to socialise,\" says Adams. \"Our children will live in different flats in town so we don't meet there so much. We get together here instead.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
