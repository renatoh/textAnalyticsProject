The stories are populated by archetypal characters: the eponymous Norm \u2013 very much a Mr Average \u2013 along with the more reckless Kelvin and hypercautious Prudence. The characters find themselves in dilemmas that are all to familiar to all of us, from the risk of boozing and smoking to the risk of doing that charity sky dive \u2026 well, maybe not all of us.
