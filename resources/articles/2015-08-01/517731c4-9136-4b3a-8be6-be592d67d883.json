Tour\u00e9 scored City\u2019s first two goals, the 32-year-old\u2019s fine display one of many in Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s side. Vincent Kompany registered the third, diverting David Silva\u2019s 59th-minute header beyond Boaz Myhill. Asked if West Brom had made it too simple for City, Tour\u00e9 said: \u201cNo, we made it easy because we played our own football with the belief and intensity. In the first half maybe we were able to score four goals. In the second half we just controlled the game and it was a brilliant goal from Kompany.\u201d Last season Tour\u00e9 appeared likely to leave the club due to differences with the hierarchy. He also suffered criticism for a perceived failure to reach his usual high standards. Yet the midfielder pointed to his goal record and how he led Ivory Coast to February\u2019s Africa Cup of Nations triumph. \u201cI think last season people are talking all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me I\u2019m quite surprised. Last season was not the best season for us, but second in the table I think is not bad at all. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of criticism about me but it\u2019s not been a bad season. Twelve goals and I won the Copa for my country; it\u2019s not bad at all. I know what I want, I know what I have to do, I don\u2019t care what people are saying about me. \u201cI\u2019m not back \u2013 I\u2019m always there. People have to understand football is not talking about one player, it\u2019s about the team. The team did a massive job [against West Bromwich], we played very well, against a difficult side. West Brom have a good manager, good players and experience in the Premier League and the team played brilliantly. Full credit to the team. \u201cSometimes people have to understand we are human beings. Things can go wrong [even] when you are fully focused in your job, you love your job and want to win all the time. My job is to make people happy and myself happy as well. \u201cSometimes people criticise you unfairly. But we don\u2019t care what they say. I love my job, I love playing football and I don\u2019t worry about what people are saying about me.\u201d City welcome Chelsea to the Etihad Stadium on Sunday. They know victory will put them five points ahead of the champions after Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s team drew with Swansea City in their season opener. \u201cNow we have a massive game on Sunday against a direct rival. I hope it will be a good one for us,\u201d said Tour\u00e9. City\u2019s performance was the most convincing of the expected title challengers on the opening weekend. \u201cThe Premier League is very tough, there\u2019s a very long way to go. There\u2019s 37 more games. Sunday is going to be tough again, and after that we have Everton. I think it is a strong start. We are fully focused this year. We want to do it for the fans, for the chairman and Sheikh Mansour [the owner], who are doing a lot to make this club great. \u201cIt was a great start. I hope this year is going to be fine for us. The important thing is we have a target. That is to bounce back like we did two seasons ago. We have to keep working hard.\u201d Of his second goal, which involved an exchange with Wilfried Bony, Tour\u00e9 said: \u201cMy goal was nice, it was a one-two with Bony. My team-mate with the international team. We know each other well. It was a great goal.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
