But while the American lost his belts in a rematch later in 2001, he is not convinced history will repeat itself when boxing\u2019s latest Cinderella Man, Andy Ruiz Jr, faces Anthony Joshua on Saturday. \u201cJoshua is so used to knocking everybody out, but he has to remain disciplined and quite frankly make it a boring fight if he wants to win,\u201d said Rahman, whose fighter Michael Hunter meets Alexander Povetkin on the undercard. \u201cIf Anthony is disciplined, and uses his height, reach and distance he can secure a victory. But if Joshua tries to make it exciting and go for the knockout, then he gets knocked out.\u201d It is clear, though, that Rahman gives the edge to Ruiz. \u201cAndy\u2019s going to make sure it isn\u2019t a dull fight \u2013 let his punches go, use his hand speed and combinations. I think Andy can repeat if he does that.\u201d Rahman also dismisses suggestions that the Mexican-American might have let his victory over Joshua go to his head by buying new houses and cars to celebrate winning the WBA, IBF and WBO belts in June. \u201cFloyd Mayweather liked buying all kinds of cars and bought them his whole career, and it wasn\u2019t to his detriment,\u201d said Rahman. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of the lavish gifts Ruiz purchased for himself are going to deter him. If anything, it\u2019s going to make him hungry because he wants to sustain that. \u201cIt\u2019s quite frankly easier when you want to go and take something,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut Ruiz is champion and I haven\u2019t seen any slacking off in training. He can fight and if he lands his punches you are going to see the same again.\u201d Meanwhile Rahman, who is still sharp and in good shape at 47, believes there is no comparison between Lewis and Joshua when it comes to assessing their talent. \u201cIf you just look at the facts and look at how many Olympians, world champions and hall of famers Lewis has beat, it\u2019s no debate,\u201d he insisted. \u201cLennox fought everybody and beat everybody. Joshua\u2019s career is not yet over so it\u2019s unfair to compare them at this stage. Let\u2019s wait and see when it\u2019s over. But right now Lennox is way ahead.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
