The 21-year-old, bought for a fee of \u00a33m from Luton in August, had been the subject of an \u00a38.5m bid from Wigan and inquiries from Arsenal's manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, Tottenham's Martin Jol and Portsmouth's Harry Redknapp. Davies's original contract was not due to expire for three years but his improved deal ties him to the club until 2010. \"This is great news for the club,\" Albion's manager Bryan Robson said. \"Curtis was obviously disappointed about being relegated but he has underlined his character by showing he is willing to fight for the club and try to help us get promoted. \"We felt after the way he performed last season he deserved the reward of a new contract,\" he added. \"The fact he has signed means he is now fully focused on trying to get the Albion back up.\" The Championship club's chairman Jeremy Peace believes the deal is testimony to Albion's ambition. \"We've stated on countless occasions this summer we aim to strengthen the squad not dismantle it,\" he said. \"This not only underlines our intentions to retain key members of the squad but also to build for the future. We want to get back up to the Premier League as soon as possible and establish ourselves at that level. Curtis has a big part to play in achieving that.\" Sunderland are looking to bolster their own promotion hopes by signing Tottenham's Andy Reid after the \u00a31.75m sale of Julio Arca to Middlesbrough."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
