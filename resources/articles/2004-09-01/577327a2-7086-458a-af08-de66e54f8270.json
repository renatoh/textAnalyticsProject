There is a brief pause and then each class files wordlessly along the school's covered cloisters (there are no corridors at Mossbourne - they are havens for unruliness and bullying) and into one of the school's \"terraced house-style\" learning areas to complete the first day of the new term. Mossbourne, it does not require a proud education minister to point out, is very new, very ambitious and very different from your average secondary, from the glass roof of its \u00a3325m timber and glass Richard Rogers Partnership-designed building to the state-of-the-art computer \"clusters\" located on the ground floor of each learning area (not forgetting the River Cafe-supervised school dinners and planned organic kitchen garden designed by Jamie Oliver). In a borough where multifarious social challenges combined with town hall ineffectiveness and mismanagement on an epic scale have led to a disastrous educational record, the academy is charged with proving that Britain's inner cities can offer high quality, well-resourced state education to children of all abilities, including the offspring of the middle class parents who currently desert Hackney in droves in search of better schools. Mossbourne, oversubscribed this year, belongs to the government's flagship programme of academies - state schools funded partly through private sponsorship and granted freedoms to innovate and experiment in an effort to raise standards, particularly in deprived areas. Five schools opening this term bring the total to 17 nationally, with a government goal of 200 academies by 2010 under a rapid expansion ordered by Downing Street but questioned by some critics concerned that the fledgling and expensive programme has yet to prove its success. Pacing a playground still faintly bearing the tracks of builders' machinery and overlooked by the school's two giant three-storey \"wings\", Mossbourne's principal, Sir Michael Wilshaw, (the knighthood rewarded services to education) acknowledges that the pressure is great, nationally as much as locally, to ensure that the academy succeeds. \"This is more than just another school in Hackney: it is a symbolic school, an emblem, saying these places should be where children from all backgrounds in inner city areas should come and be successful.\" Adding to the symbolism is the academy's location, on the crushed rubble of the old Hackney Downs school, decreed a failure and closed seven years ago, yet once one of the top grammars in the country and boasting old boys including Harold Pinter and Michael Caine. Whatever their social background, all concerned parents have the same fundamental requirements of a school, Sir Michael argues. They want good results, a sense that their child's individual needs will be identified and met, and - crucially - a safe environment, free from bullying and disruptive or dangerous behaviour. The school, forming a wide V shape with its windowless soundproof back to two noisy railway lines and its mainly glass front overlooking the triangular \"social area\" and the grassy expanse of Hackney Downs, has been designed according to the principal's requirements to minimise behavioural problems. From his glass fronted office, the principal can survey the entire playground, as well as the school's approach road and the downs. When changing lessons, pupils do not rush down internal corridors but must leave by the front door of one learning area and walk along the cloister to the next. \"I want to supervise these children at all times,\" says Sir Michael, who made his educational name revolutionising the educational performance of St Bonaventure's in nearby Newham. \"I can stand here [in the playground] and see their progress around the school clearly.\" The controlled approach extends to discipline and general behaviour, though with only 11-year-olds in the school so far - the academy will fill up year by year - the silent post-lunch break line-up feels almost eerily orderly. Later, as Sir Michael, a calm but commanding figure with a chief executive's air and wide pinstripe suit, enters one of the technology \"clusters\" where pupils sit in a three storey atrium beneath white cafe-style umbrellas, most of the youngsters remember to stand up, as they must, whenever a teacher enters a classroom. Today, on day two of their Mossbourne careers, the academy's pupils will be divided into sets for all main curriculum subjects, based on the tests each of 600 applicants sat before being banded and selected to engineer a cross section of ability. The ability mix, says Sir Michael, is crucial if the academy is to succeed. \"I wanted to ensure a balanced intake. We don't want a secondary modern school, we want a comprehensive school.\" A sophisticated continuous assessment system, with catch-up classes for weak areas and extension classes to build on strengths, will ensure that each pupil - including black boys, so often let down by the education system - is stretched, he argues. \"My aim is to get children here to university and Oxbridge, as well as developing those who won't take academic routes.\" Mossbourne's fate will depend on the confidence it inspires in parents, and particularly the middle classes, as a genuinely different type of school which is more than a very stylish building. If it could ensure its success by sheer force of will, and some confident self-promotion, then its chances, even in a traditionally under-achieving area, are strong. A sponsor, Clive Bourne, an engaging Hackney-born businessman who put \u00a32m and apparently endless effort into ensuring that the academy opened its doors this term, argues it will become a blueprint for all future schools in Britain. Nibbling a River Cafe-influenced salad and grinning broadly yesterday, he pronounced: \"All schools should be like this.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
