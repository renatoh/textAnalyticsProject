In an interview with al-Hurra television, which broadcasts from Virginia to the Middle East, he said the images of naked Iraqi inmates being sexually humiliated by smiling US guards did not represent \"the America I know\". His comments came as the US military's new head of prisons in Iraq said some interrogation techniques of Iraqi prisoners would be halted and others toned down. Major General Geoffrey Miller, who was previously in charge of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, said he wanted to apologise \"for our nation and for our military for the small number of soldiers who committed illegal or unauthorised acts here\". His comments came as he led reporters on a tour of the notorious Abu Ghraib jail, west of Baghdad. Aides have described Mr Bush as being \"shaken\" by the scandal. A White House spokesman, Scott McClellan, said the interviews were intended to deliver Mr Bush's message that the treatment of Iraqi inmates in the pictures obtained by CBS was \"unacceptable\". \"This is an opportunity for the president to speak directly to the people in Arab nations and let them know that the images that we all have seen are shameless and unacceptable,\" he said. Mr Bush told al-Hurra that any that US service personnel guilty of such abuse would face justice. Al-Hurra is generally viewed in the region as propaganda, but Mr Bush is giving a second interview to Dubai-based al-Arabiya, which is watched across the Middle East and viewed as a reliable news source. Some lawyers and politicians in the US have said the CBS photographs were simply the tip of the iceberg, and there have been claims that they show an ingrained culture of abuse. The US army said yesterday more than 20 prisoners had died in custody at US military jails in Iraq and Afghanistan, and two of the inmates were deemed to have been murdered by Americans. The investigation of one murder has been completed. It is understood the soldier was convicted of using excessive force when he shot dead a prisoner who was throwing stones at him. The soldier was discharged from the service but not given a jail sentence. Another suspected murder, involving a CIA contractor, is continuing. One prisoner's death was ruled to have been a \"justified homicide\". Investigations into the deaths of 12 other detainees in Iraq and Afghanistan since December 2002 had concluded that the causes were either undetermined or natural, Maj Gen Ryder said. Despite suggestions by senior military and defence officials that the abuse was an isolated incident, there were growing claims it was orchestrated by intelligence agencies. Most damning was a report by a senior US officer that concluded there was \"sadistic, blatant and wanton criminal abuse\" of prisoners to soften them up for interrogation. Major General Antonio Taguba wrote in February that US army intelligence officers, CIA agents and private contractors \"actively requested that military police guards set physical and mental conditions for favourable interrogation of witnesses\". The methods included threatening men with rape, assaulting prisoners with broom handles and fluorescent lights, allowing a guard to stitch the wound of a prisoner and using military dogs to terrify detainees. According to his report, obtained first by the New Yorker magazine on Monday, soldiers were ordered to break the will of detainees before interrogating them. Lawyers for some of the soldiers shown in photographs humiliating Iraqi detainees claimed their clients were simply following orders. Guy Womack, who represents Charles Graner, an army corrections officer, said: \"It was being controlled and devised by the military intelligence community and other governmental agencies, including the CIA.\" Staff Sergeant Ivan Frederick, another soldier embroiled in the scandal, will also argue that he was following orders. His wife, Martha, told NBC TV: \"Those who are responsible are standing behind the curtain and watching him take the fall for it. It's almost like being a pawn in a chess game.\" Emails Sgt Frederick wrote to his family, which have been obtained by the New Yorker, suggest he was uneasy with the treatment of prisoners. Senator Edward Kennedy, speaking after a crisis meeting of the Senate armed services committee on Capitol Hill, said he believed the abuse was more widespread and might also be occurring at the Guantanamo Bay prison camp in Cuba. \"I think the important point I took from this hearing is that this does not appear to be an isolated incident,\" he said. \"There are reports in Iraq and also Afghanistan, and I think we also have to find out [about] the conduct of personnel in Guantanamo.\" The committee said it would hold a public hearing into the abuse allegations at the earliest possible opportunity. Mr Rumsfeld would be called to give evidence, senators said. Speaking at a news briefing at the Pentagon, Mr Rumsfeld said he \"hoped\" the abuse was an isolated incident. He said it was too early to know whether there had been similar incidents in other US military prisons, including those in Afghanistan and at Guantanamo Bay. \"All of our rules, all of our procedures, all of our training, is against the abuse of people who are detained,\" he said. The episode was \"unhelpful. In a fundamental way, it's harmful,\" he said. \"It is, we hope, an isolated case ... We're taking, and will continue to take, whatever steps are necessary to hold accountable those who may have violated the code of military conduct and betrayed the trust placed in them by the American people.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
