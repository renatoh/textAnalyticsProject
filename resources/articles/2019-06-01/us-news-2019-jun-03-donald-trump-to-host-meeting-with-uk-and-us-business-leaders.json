About 10 executives have been asked to attend the gathering on Tuesday at St James\u2019s Palace in central London, making it a much smaller affair than the business leaders\u2019 banquet at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire that attracted about 150 guests during Trump\u2019s visit to the UK last year. The meeting, which is expected to last about an hour, will be hosted by the US president and Theresa May, sources told the Guardian. Ivanka Trump and the Duke of York will also be attending. Invites were extended to an equal number of US and UK businesses, across a range of sectors including defence, banking and pharmaceuticals. The meeting is expected to focus on the importance of collaboration between companies on both sides of the Atlantic. Among the business leaders expected to attend are the BAE Systems chairman, Sir Roger Carr, National Grid\u2019s chief executive, John Pettigrew, GSK\u2019s Emma Walmsley and Jes Staley of Barclays. Rakesh Kapoor, the outgoing chief executive of the consumer goods company Reckitt Benckiser, is also on the list. US business leaders are expected to include the Lockheed Martin chief executive, Marillyn Hewson, and the head of Est\u00e9e Lauder UK and Ireland, Philippe Warnery. Richard Timperlake, the vice-president for European sales at the software company Splunk, has also been invited. The chief executive of Fidelity Investments, Abigail Johnson, was on the list, but she is understood to be staying in the US. Sky News reported last week that JP Morgan\u2019s chief executive and chairman, Jamie Dimon, was thought to be among those invited. However, the Guardian understands the bank\u2019s head of Europe, Middle East and Africa, Vis Raghavan, will be taking his place owing to scheduling and logistical issues. JP Morgan declined to comment. Those invited are from businesses with notable operations on both sides of the Atlantic. A No 10 spokeswoman declined to confirm the details of the meeting, but said the office was considering releasing the list later on Monday.
