And even near-universal praise of the kind she received for her portrayal of Cersei Lannister in Game of Thrones doesn\u2019t do the trick. \u201cNo, it makes me doubt myself more,\u201d she says, when we meet in her apartment-like suite at the Soho House in Berlin. \u201cBecause you think they must be fucking lying.\u201d Headey, who speaks a kind of metropolitan RP spiced up with Yorkshire vowels, cockney glottal stops and Californian grammar, swears liberally and enthusiastically. With her prominent tattoos and an endearingly earthy attitude, it\u2019s fair to say that she betrays none of Cersei\u2019s regal airs. Nor is she making a play for sympathy or approbation. What she means is that there is no way of establishing objective criteria for what makes a performance \u201cgood\u201d, and people are acclaimed for a variety of reasons, many of which are insincere. \u201cYou have to push away the voice that goes, \u2018You\u2019re fucking shit, mate\u2019\u201d, she says, laughing, \u201cwhich is really hard some days.\u201d Writing in the New Yorker, Clive James described Headey\u2019s Cersei as \u201ca beautiful expression of arbitrary terror, combining shapely grace with limitless evil in just the right measure to scare a man to death while rendering him helpless with desire.\u201d He wasn\u2019t lying. Watching her in Game of Thrones \u2013 and she was never less than watchable \u2013 was like a study in tyranny as a seductive art. There was something magnetically human about her inhumanity. You were drawn to her devious charms even as you recoiled from her brutal deeds. At its best the show managed to transcend the blushing fact that it contained fire-breathing dragons and armies of demented zombies. And it was most often at its best when Headey was on screen and radiating cold calculation and ruthless intrigue. By common agreement it was at its worst in the final series, which managed to be both torturously slow and narratively rushed. Aside from the clunky plotting, the problem was that many of the best characters, played by actors of the calibre of Diana Rigg, Charles Dance, Jonathan Pryce, Stephen Dillane and Michelle Fairley, had been killed off, exposing the limitations of some of the actors in the leading roles, which up until then had been more symbolic than dramatic. But as the denouement approached, the leads were called upon to drive the drama and, like the script, were not quite up to the job. When I outline this theory, Headey is careful not to take the bait. \u201cNo, listen,\u201d she says, \u201cI invested as a viewer and I have my favourite characters. And I\u2019ve got a few of my own gripes. But I haven\u2019t sat down drunkly with David [Benioff] and Dan [Weiss] yet.\u201d Benioff and Weiss are the two showrunners who adapted George RR Martin\u2019s books and made one of the world\u2019s most popular TV series. What will she say when she has that drink? \u201cI will say I wanted a better death.\u201d In the penultimate episode Cersei was crushed by falling masonry along with her brother-lover Jaime (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau). It was an underwhelming end, to put it politely. \u201cObviously you dream of your death,\u201d she says. \u201cYou could go in any way on that show. So I was kind of gutted. But I just think they couldn\u2019t have pleased everyone. No matter what they did, I think there was going to be some big comedown from the climb.\u201d Following the anticlimactic finale, reports emerged of actors experiencing a difficult aftermath. Kit Harington, who played Jon Snow, released a statement confirming that he had checked into a luxury rehab in Connecticut. Headey suffered no such post-dramatic stress syndrome. She\u2019s still in touch with many of what she calls the \u201cThroners\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re all on a giant WhatsApp group which is a daily pile-on,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s hilarious. You can tell who\u2019s been drinking on that one.\u201d But as for a comedown, it\u2019s not happened. \u201cIt was amazing,\u201d she says, with cheery pragmatism. \u201cAnd things end and you move on.\u201d Given that the show turned Headey from a low-profile supporting actor into a global star, it\u2019s rather a large nine-year commitment to move on from. But she\u2019s now 45 and, she says, too long in the tooth to get caught up in the emotional turmoil of jobs finishing. \u201cWhen I was much younger I would weep every time I ended a job,\u201d she says, \u201cand I would take everybody\u2019s phone number, every single person I\u2019d ever said hello to, because it had been such an intense experience. And then you get older and you have more of those experiences and they become less intense. I think the guys who grew up on that show, they probably formed really deep friendships that will carry them through. But most of us have our own kids. If kids don\u2019t balance you, then nothing does.\u201d Headey has two children, a nine-year-old boy from a marriage that ended in 2011 and a three-year-old girl with film-maker Dan Cadan, from whom she is now separated. It\u2019s said that many years ago she had an affair with the actor Jerome Flynn that either ended badly or had an unfortunate reprise or both. That\u2019s hardly an unusual circumstance in the film business, but in their case they were both cast in Game of Thrones and, according to rumours coming from the set, such was the enmity that they had to be kept apart. During the course of eight seasons their characters were only brought together once, very briefly, and Headey\u2019s Cersei didn\u2019t so much as glance at Flynn\u2019s Bronn. She now lives in East Dulwich in south London, after a short stint in her native Yorkshire, following 12 years in Los Angeles. Having made her debut as a 17-year-old in the film Waterland, Headey carved out a busy but not particularly notable career in the UK and then America. With her striking looks, she tended to be cast in thrillers and horror films that by and large didn\u2019t trouble the box-office charts. Perhaps her real breakthrough came in television, playing Sarah Connor in Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles. The short-lived series made little impact here, but her performance as a smart, tough woman did not go unnoticed in Hollywood. A couple of years later Peter Dinklage (Cersei\u2019s brother, Tyrion Lannister in Game of Thrones) suggested that Headey should read for a part in a script he\u2019d been given that mixed the fantasy genre with ribald characterisations and baroque power struggles. \u201cWe were doing this little indie in LA called Pete Smalls is Dead,\u201d she recalls. \u201cAnd we were all sharing like one square of a hot caravan. Pete said you\u2019ve got to read this. I love Pete. I think he\u2019s wonderful and so I was like: \u2018Oh, if Pete\u2019s reading it, it must be fucking great.\u2019 That was my measure.\u201d Used to projects with brief shelf-lives, she thought she\u2019d go to Scotland and \u201chave a laugh for a month\u201d. A decade later she was earning, according to the Hollywood Reporter, $1m per episode for the eighth and final series of Game of Thrones. That kind of success and that kind of money is life-changing. In terms of her career, it means she\u2019s now sent scripts in which she is actively interested. Doors are opened, meetings are made, and everywhere she can expect the star treatment. But all of that comes with greatly increased fame, scrutiny and public recognition, none of which she much enjoys. \u201cSometimes when you\u2019re on the tube and suddenly someone nudges somebody else,\u201d she says. \u201cI panic in those situations. I go, fuck, I don\u2019t know how to handle that. Or someone chases you out of a tube \u2013 that\u2019s the weirdest thing. Those moments I hate.\u201d You still travel by tube? I ask with surprise. Apparently she does. The quid pro quo for the fame \u2013 aside from the money \u2013 is, that it \u201cgives you a voice\u201d. \u201cSo using it in ways that are helpful and supportive to others \u2013 it sounds naff but it\u2019s genuine \u2013 that\u2019s the balance for me,\u201d she says. Recently she\u2019s been using her voice to bring attention to the plight of migrants. Like many people she was deeply upset by the photograph of Alan Kurdi, the young Syrian boy found dead on a Turkish beach, that was taken in September 2015. She wanted to do something and got involved with the International Rescue Committee, visited migrant centres in Lesbos, where she befriended a Syrian family of refugees now relocated in northern Germany. It\u2019s a concern that also led to her appearing in a low-budget British feature film called The Flood, which was made by three people who had worked as volunteers at the Calais \u201cjungle\u201d \u2013 director Anthony Woodley, writer Helen Kingston, and producer Luke Healy. The film-makers wanted to open up a dialogue around the refugee/migrant debate that acknowledged the complexity and emotions on both sides of the issue. Headey plays a rather cold and officious civil servant assessing asylum claims at a refugee centre in England. Her character is also going through a difficult divorce, separation from her child, and is drinking too much. It\u2019s an understated performance, delivered in flat Yorkshire tones, a portrait of an emotionally vulnerable woman hiding under a harsh exterior. After rejecting one Eritrean claimant, she has second thoughts and goes against her number-crunching boss (Iain Glen, also of Game of Thrones) to come to the refugee\u2019s aid. It\u2019s about as far from high production values and every other Game of Thrones value as you could get. Headey was attracted to the change in scale. \u201cI sort of grew up in the small British film industry,\u201d she says, \u201cback when films were made for no money by people who felt passionate about their projects, and were shot in a really small space of time. And I missed that way of film-making.\u201d The film was actually made three years ago but has been sitting around waiting for a release spot. The delay, she says, was because another film about refugees had already been released, so the film industry, in her scathing phrase, had \u201cfulfilled its quota\u201d on the issue. \u201cIt\u2019s not a cool thing to talk about,\u201d she says of the refugee crisis. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of ugly. And sort of unfathomable. But when are we going to realise we need to find something that works?\u201d At the same time she acknowledges that it\u2019s a complex subject that can\u2019t easily be reduced to simple answers, noting, as the film does, that gangsters and criminals conceal themselves among and exploit genuine refugees. Nonetheless she thinks Germany has risen far more impressively to the challenge of the refugee crisis than the UK, which she says has neglected its moral and international obligations to unaccompanied minors. She has witnessed on a previous visit how differently things are done in Berlin. This time round she\u2019s in the German capital making an action film called \u2013 Nigel Farage beware! \u2013 Gunpowder Milkshake. It involves a band of female assassins and features Angela Bassett. Headey says she is enjoying the fun of physical exertion, but while she\u2019s done plenty of action and horror films, they don\u2019t reflect her own taste in film-making. For many years she\u2019s been nurturing an ambition to move to the other side of the camera. She\u2019s carefully studied how directors construct scenes and advise actors. She has developed strong ideas about what works and what doesn\u2019t, and says she\u2019s always amazed when actors don\u2019t want to direct. Now she has made the transition with a short film she directed that she\u2019s currently entering into the festival circuit. Entitled The Trap, it\u2019s what she calls an \u201cintimate, emotionally driven piece\u201d that she wrote nine years ago in the course of a single day. It\u2019s taken this long to bring it to fruition. Even by the standards of the notoriously slow-moving film industry, that seems like a glacial progression. She doesn\u2019t appear at all bothered by the lengthy development period. What matters to her is that she finally made it. Unlike with acting, she is fully confident of her abilities as a film-maker. Of the experience of directing, she says: \u201cI\u2019ve never, ever in my life felt more content and in my place. Ever.\u201d The Trap is a remarkably accomplished piece of work that features some gripping naturalistic performances from several actors, including the wonderful Michelle Fairley, yet another Game of Thrones colleague. The writing is crisp, spare and shot through with bristling repressed emotions. Headey\u2019s great cinematic hero, her \u201cnorth star of directing\u201d, is Shane Meadows, whose extraordinary four-part TV drama The Virtues recently concluded, having explored emotional depths that few drama writers would even consider attempting to reach. \u201cHe pulls you in and you\u2019re kind of giggling and then you realise that you\u2019re part of something really dark,\u201d she says approvingly of Meadows. Without giving anything away about the plot, it would be fair to say that, though only 30 minutes long, The Trap perfectly fulfils that brief. Amazingly, after the nine-year hiatus, the shooting took only four days \u2013 almost as quick as the writing. \u201cIt was a small crew moving at pace.\u201d She says her philosophy as a film-maker involves creating an environment in which everyone is heard and everyone loves what they\u2019re doing. That sounds rather idealistic but, as she says, some directors behave as if they hate actors, treating them as a necessary evil rather than active collaborators. The irony is that now she is at the pinnacle of her acting powers, and her power to make acting choices, what she most wants to do is write and direct. That\u2019s not to say she\u2019s going to quit acting, but her plan is to be more selective in her work. In the meantime, she can turn her thoughts to her other great creative impulse: her next tattoo. She has at least 13 visible tattoos, including images of flowers, butterflies, birds, stars, hearts and a Ganesha elephant godhead. As she tells me, she\u2019s not interested in expensive handbags, but she can\u2019t resist the allure of another inking. Every six months, she says, she gets a \u201cjones\u201d for a new tattoo. \u201cIt resets me,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s like a ritual.\u201d She doesn\u2019t know what the next one will be yet, but what usually happens is that she\u2019ll have the seed of an idea and then she\u2019ll start to obsess about it until she can find someone to do it. Her girlfriends often tell her that she\u2019s gone too far, but she\u2019s not put off by that. What troubles her is when her tattoos are covered up for filming. \u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s weird, I don\u2019t feel whole.\u201d Only her most devoted fans are likely to notice her next tattoo, but her directorial debut is well worth catching. Forget the Iron Throne. The seat of her true destiny may well turn out to be the director\u2019s chair. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 and 19 June 2019: to correct the location where the body of drowned child migrant Alan Kurdi was found and famously photographed in 2015 \u2013 it was a beach near Bodrum, Turkey \u2013 and to remove a reference to refugee camp funding.
