One more innings and then he can sit back until day-night hostilities resume in the new year, secure in the knowledge that the past week or so has dispelled any lingering doubts over his participation in February's World Cup. Ever since the left-hander made his debut in limited- overs internationals in 1996, and scored centuries against Pakistan in his second and third matches, he has been, for the most part, indispensable. Yet there is a paradox. No England player in that time has played more matches than his 89; and none who has played, say, in excess of 30 can equal his average of a shade above 42. But he has seemed more insecure than anyone of such achievement. Of the 21 games he has missed in that period five were in England's unsuccessful 1999 World Cup, for which he was not even selected after being sidelined for the latter part of the previous winter with a badly broken thumb. No wonder he will feel quietly satisfied when his name is announced with 14 others at the end of the month. In a form of the game that is constantly evolving Knight's belligerence at the top of the order evokes the spirit that began with the renegade Kiwi Mark Greatbatch, whose helicoptering blade illuminated the later stages of the 1991 World Cup. With the fielding restrictions in place, there is a hard new ball to ping off the bat and it has to be attacked; and Knight and Marcus Trescothick should be one of the most potent partnerships in the game. But the Somerset man is starting to look leaden and Knight has been fighting a lone battle, outstandingly with his century in Sydney and the 70 made two days later at better than a run a ball. All the while, though, he has been struggling for acceptance as a cricketer of pedigree, apparently mindful that the England management are looking in the long term to fill their side not with bits-and-pieces players or one-day specialists but with the Test players. Far from feeling comfortable with the rise of Michael Vaughan, for example, he has been threatened by his presence. It is all to do with the perception, possibly by the player himself, that a man who plays one-day cricket but not Tests (he has had 17 of those, usually as a replacement, since his debut in 1995) is an incom plete cricketer. For all his one-day achievements, Knight would trade it for recognition as a Test batsman of calibre. Yet, if there is a stigma attached to \"one-day specialist\", there should not be. Each should be to his own. The skills of one overlap the other to a degree, but not entirely. Knight uses his supreme fitness, nimble-footedness and gimlet eye to go down the pitch to fast bowlers and carve them over the off side or sit back and pull. Only when he puts away the coloured clothing and dons the white does he become vulnerable. The fields are different, fast bowlers use the short ball more and the adventurous half-century, lifeblood of one-day cricket, is merely the foundations of a Test innings. But it is Knight's technique against high-class Test bowling which comes under most scrutiny. Runs through the off side, the glides to third man, are hazardous when there is a ring of close fielders. At fault is his back foot, the left, which, try as he might to correct it, still retreats under pressure. It means that rather than line the ball up and play back down the pitch, he is hitting across deliveries only fractionally outside off stump and risking the edge. And, if the ball swings or jags into him, there is nowhere to go but play around his front pad and risk lbw. That no one in this VB Series has been able to move the ball into him - his willingness to go down the pitch and negate any swing has had something to do with this - has been to his advantage. While that fundamental flaw remains - and, at 33, an instinctive movement under pressure will not change now - he will never achieve his Test ambitions. But he can be the linchpin of England's World Cup batting and he deserves to be recognised as such. \u00b7 Adam Hollioake was standing by to play in Perth, the city where his brother Ben died in a car accident in March. He was put on alert for his first England game since the last World Cup after Ian Blackwell suffered a hand injury from Steve Harmison's bowling in the nets. But x-rays showed no fracture."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
