This has turned into a disaster in Des Moines for Europe. Only the greatest comeback in team golf history will prevent the USA from keeping firm hold of the Solheim Cup. The sad thing for Annika Sorenstam and her European players as they peruse the ominous scenario of Sunday singles \u2013 traditionally an American strong suit \u2013 is that defeat may arrive by an embarrassing margin. For now Juli Inkster\u2019s team are a mere three and a half points short of the tally needed to confirm cup retention. Sunday tee times have been advanced by two hours in a bid to avoid inclement weather. The Europeans may be delighted to exit stage left as quickly as humanly possible. What a bruising experience this has been, particularly for Sorenstam, who was not accustomed to being a distant second during her playing days. Day two reflected day one in respect of fourballs being the canvas upon which the USA plastered their dominance. One key difference resonated in the wonderful standard, as produced after lunch. The home side had retained a three-point lead after the sharing of morning foursomes. That the US took the next session by 3-1 means they lead 10\u00bd to 5\u00bd with individual battles to come. The only element of afternoon cheer for Europe was provided by Jodi Ewart Shadoff and Anna Nordqvist who produced a better-ball score of 11 under par in swatting aside Lizette Salas and Angel Yin by 4&amp;2. The Americans could rightly argue they did little wrong. Carlota Ciganda and Melissa Reid suffered in similar circumstances. In the opening fourball match, the Europeans were eight under par but slipped to a two-up loss. The two Brittanys, Lang and Lincicome, provided the US showing that their opponents couldn\u2019t cope with. Paula Creamer and Austin Ernst earned fourball success over Karine Icher and Madelene Sagstrom, by 2&amp;1. Catriona Matthew\u2019s hitherto perfect record here \u2013 she had won two matches out of two \u2013 was ended when in partnership with Georgia Hall against Cristie Kerr and Lexi Thompson, by 3&amp;2. Earlier in the day, Kerr had become the leading points winner in US Solheim Cup history, with 19, as she and Thompson thumped Shadoff and Caroline Masson, 5&amp;3. \u201cI don\u2019t really care about that,\u201d insisted Kerr. \u201cHonestly, I never thought about that once. That\u2019s just something to talk about. I just want to help our team win. \u201cAs I have said before, that doesn\u2019t matter much to me. I want to keep winning matches and keep helping my team win the cup.\u201d Actions backed up Kerr\u2019s words. She provided the shot of the day when holing from a greenside bunker in the subsequent fourballs. Make that 20 points. In an altogether different movie Charley Hull\u2019s injury worries would not be a major concern for Sorenstam. Instead the 21-year-old\u2019s problems rather sum up what has regressed into a wretched week for the visiting team. Hull did not hit a shot in anger on Saturday, with the Englishwoman instead confined to a medical room to receive treatment on her right wrist. This injury has plagued Hull throughout the year, meaning Sorenstam may be criticised for playing the youngster during back-to-back sessions on Friday. In Sorenstam\u2019s defence is that Hull was keen to play in the Saturday fourballs but was firmly overruled by her captain with a bigger picture in mind. Hull is, for now, expected to play in the singles but she is clearly not at her best. In her absence, plus that of the stricken Suzann Pettersen, the lack of depth in the European side has been brutally exposed. One glimmer of hope has been provided by the 21-year-old Hall. She arrived in Iowa in fine spirits, having finished third in the Women\u2019s British Open. Despite a Saturday afternoon loss, Hall earned the glowing praise of Nordqvist during successive foursome victories. \u201cShe has certainly played like a superstar the last two days,\u201d said Nordqvist. \u201cShe\u2019s very fearless and she\u2019s a fun character. I didn\u2019t know her at all coming into this week, but it\u2019s certainly been a blast playing alongside her. She has a great future in front of her.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
