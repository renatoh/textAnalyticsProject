She\u2019s a high-achieving lawyer at a big-name Manhattan law firm \u2013 ordered, orderly, in control. Then one day a chance meeting with a long-lost love, Josh, causes her to quit her job and move across the country to the small town of West Covina, California. Or as Rebecca, played by the show\u2019s creator Rachel Bloom, puts it in the full song-and-dance number that accompanies that decision: \u201cIn my soul I feel a fire, cause I\u2019m heading for the pride of the inland empire. My life\u2019s about to change \u2026 oh my gosh! Cos I\u2019m hopelessly in love with \u2026 West Covina, California.\u201d Nor is that moment, which pays detailed homage to the classic Broadway musical, a one-off. Over the course of its inventive first season, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, currently available on Netflix in the UK, races through musical theatre history, making reference to everything from Gypsy, Stephen Sondheim\u2019s classic of thwarted ambition, to the more gentle modern favourite Once. As Megan Garber wrote in The Atlantic, \u201cit\u2019s a musical [but] it\u2019s musical criticism too\u2026 a story not just with a heart\u2026 but with a brain.\u201d It\u2019s also placed musical theatre back in the spotlight \u2013 and it is not alone. For the musical has been having something of a moment. First, there was Matt Stone and Trey Parker\u2019s irreverent The Book of Mormon, which both poked fun at Broadway conventions and honoured them. Then came Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s all-conquering Hamilton, which uses rap and hip-hop to tell the story of the founding fathers. In Britain, Tim Minchin gave us one of the best new shows of recent years in Matilda and hopes this summer to repeat that feat when his adaptation of Groundhog Day opens at the Old Vic. At the age of 86, Sondheim himself is also working on a new musical with a book from Venus in Fur playwright David Ives. Based on two Luis Bu\u00f1uel films \u2013 The Exterminating Angel and The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie \u2013 it is tentatively titled All Together Now and will eventually go into workshop at New York\u2019s Public Theater, where Hamilton made its debut. Hollywood has also been quick to get in on the act \u2013 in April the Coen Brothers\u2019 most recent movie, Hail, Caesar!, paid dizzy tribute to, among other things, the great On the Town, and this December will see the release of La La Land, Damien Chazelle\u2019s romantic ode to the MGM musicals of the 1950s, starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. Meanwhile, a musical based on the songs of the Pogues is also in the works, and being developed by the unlikely trio of The Wire\u2019s David Simon, his wife, author Laura Lippman, and fellow crime writer George Pelecanos. \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is two different things, both of which are fuelling the musical\u2019s popularity,\u201d says Ben Brantley, chief theatre critic of the New York Times. \u201cOn one hand a show like Crazy Ex-Girlfriend comes from the longer tradition of The Producers, Book of Mormon, Avenue Q, Baz Luhrmann\u2019s Moulin Rouge and even Glee \u2013 they\u2019re pastiches of the musical form that both satirise and embrace the old conventions. They embrace them sincerely with an ironic smile. Then you have Hamilton \u2013 and that\u2019s something quite different. It\u2019s the first musical since the heyday of the genre to take the music that people listen to at home and integrate it seamlessly into the story on stage. It makes you rethink what the musical can do.\u201d Certainly there\u2019s no doubting that Miranda\u2019s smart, sharp, multi-Tony-award-winning retelling of the life of the man on the $10 bill, from his Caribbean childhood in St Kitts and Nevis to his untimely death in New York\u2019s Greenwich Village after a duel, is reaching parts other musicals can only dream of, thanks to its inventive combination of thoroughly modern music and a good old-fashioned tale of ambition, jealousy, desire and despair. It\u2019s Amadeus by way of The West Wing, with unstoppably hummable tunes thrown in. Small wonder that in the US tickets change hands for upwards of $1,000. In the UK there\u2019s already a waiting list, even though the show won\u2019t arrive here until the autumn of next year and the Grammy-award-laden cast album is already a global hit. \u201cHamilton is definitely a game-changer,\u201d says Mark Shenton, associate editor of the Stage. \u201cThe way it tells the story, from the music to the diverse cast playing the founding fathers, is thrilling. Its success raises all kinds of possibilities \u2013 it tells people that you no longer have to be safe to be successful. You can take risks and get rewards.\u201d Yet for all that things currently look rosy, Shenton warns that there is a huge difference between the health of the musical in Broadway and that in the West End. \u201cUnless something is a tried-and-tested hit like Book of Mormon or Hamilton, then British producers are shy of committing,\u201d he says. \u201cThe West End is coming off three big musical losses, Mrs Henderson Presents, Bend It Like Beckham and just now The Go-Between, so the musical may be back in fashion but it\u2019s also high-risk. \u201cEven revivals don\u2019t run as long as they used to \u2013 Guys and Dolls is doing well, but they\u2019ve had to parachute in a bit of stunt casting in the shape of Rebel Wilson. That said, I have high hopes for Groundhog Day, because it\u2019s an inspired idea and Tim Minchin is one of our brightest talents.\u201d It is true, too, that while the success of Hamilton is introducing new players to the game, for many the song remains the same. \u201cI have so many complex reactions to Hamilton,\u201d says writer, composer and lyricist Michael R Jackson, whose first musical, the semi-autobiographical A Strange Loop, was recently staged in Manhattan. \u201cFrom a craft standpoint Lin-Manuel is bridging the gap between two forms he loves deeply, hip-hop and musical theatre, and using one to feed into the other, and that will provide a long-term model for what can be possible, but I also think it\u2019s worth noting that any time there\u2019s a story featuring black and brown bodies it\u2019s nearly always a period piece. \u201cOne of the reasons I\u2019ve worked so hard on A Strange Loop is that it\u2019s a very contemporary story \u2013 these are the stories of people you know and see, your friends and co-workers. There\u2019s no reason musical theatre can\u2019t tell these tales \u2013 the question is, do producers want to produce them?\u201d Despite these doubts, Jackson agrees that musical theatre is healthier than it has been for some time: \u201cWe\u2019re definitely seeing a new wave of work that is showcasing diverse voices and bodies on both stage and screen.\u201d And the fact that Hamilton isn\u2019t alone in flying the flag for musical theatre suggests something bigger is occurring both on stage and off. In these difficult times it seems the musicals\u2019 penchant for escapism and fantasy holds more appeal. Certainly Crazy Ex-Girlfriend has endless compassion for its boundary-free heroine in both her crush-driven, song-singing highs and her vodka-swilling, career-imploding lows, and so, crucially, do we. Brantley says: \u201cOne of the great things about Crazy Ex-Girlfriend is that it takes that idea of the interior fantasy where you\u2019re walking down the street to a soundtrack of fantastic music, dancing and walking and singing, to its most happily demented extreme. There\u2019s something hugely appealing about that, which is why people respond to the show \u2013 don\u2019t we all have those fantasies at heart?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
