After describing the 5ft 6in, Holland international, who can also operate at both left and right back, as \"a number one character\", Pardew elaborated on Anita's talents. \"When you come through the Ajax system you have to have technical ability, trust me,\" said Newcastle's manager. \"Watching his passing this morning, you could tell he is at the level of our top players. We want to build on what we did last year and control games. If we're going to do that we need the ball and Anita is definitely going to help us on that side. He's also a top character.\" Before agreeing to join Newcastle, Anita asked to meet Pardew to discuss tactics and playing philosophy. \"I wanted to speak to the staff first,\" he said. \"I heard the philosophy of the club and it was great to hear. I'm very, very happy to be here. They showed me a video and it was good to see. The team really wants to play attractive football and that's my style. \"Sunderland also wanted me but I chose Newcastle because they really wanted me and they play wonderful football. I like to be a playmaker. I'm little but I can be very tough on the field and, if the coach needs me to, I can play anywhere.\" Ideally Pardew, who seems to have virtually given up on the idea of bringing Andy Carroll back to Tyneside from Liverpool, would like one more new face, preferably the Lille right-back Matthieu Debuchy, before the transfer window closes. \"Having kept my key players this summer I would not mind the window closing now,\" Pardew said. \"But if we can add another, that would be the icing on the cake.\" Any sales will be resisted. \"We're vulnerable to a Champions League club and the salaries and fees they can pay,\" said Pardew. \"But Mike Ashley [Newcastle's owner] does not sell cheap so they'd have to pay a lot of money.\" Newcastle face a tough start to the season with a home game against Tottenham on Saturday evening, before a trip to Greece for a Europa League first-leg qualifier against Atromitos of Athens on Thursday and then a visit to Chelsea next Saturday. \"I noted how Stoke played a complete second XI in one of their Europa games last season and left senior players behind,\" said Pardew. \"I can understand that. We have to be very intelligent in what we do. \"The scheduling of the Chelsea game is a bit unfortunate as, with the Notting Hill Carnival being on in London that weekend, the police more or less dictated it had to be played on the Saturday which gives us a really tight turnaround. It gives us a disadvantage.\" So much so that Newcastle's manager is pondering flying to Athens without some key performers who would be rested ahead of the Stamford Bridge fixture. \"I might possibly leave some senior players in England,\" he said. \"But we're really pleased to be in the Europa League and, if we can, we'll try and give it a real good go.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
