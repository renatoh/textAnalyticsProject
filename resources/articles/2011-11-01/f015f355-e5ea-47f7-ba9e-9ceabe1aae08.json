Woodward, who coached England to World Cup success in 2003, warned Johnson he needed to experience coaching at club level before thinking about the national side. \"We had a conversation in 2008 about whether he should take the job when he was first offered it,\" Woodward told the Sunday Times. \"I told him that he would be mad to do so, that he had to work with Leicester first so that he could really earn his stripes as a coach. He has the qualities to be an outstanding coach, just as good as he was as a player and captain, but even he cannot learn this job at the very top level on the hoof.\" Cue Cipriani's return \u2026 Now that Johnson is out of the way at Twickenham, stand by for more of Danny Cipriani. The former Wasps fly-half has not been seen in an England shirt since swapping London for the Super 15 last year but has been over here brushing up his speed work with the sprint coach Margot Wells and could steal a few headlines for the Barbarians on Saturday. Although England favour domestic-based players, what price an international return in the near future?
