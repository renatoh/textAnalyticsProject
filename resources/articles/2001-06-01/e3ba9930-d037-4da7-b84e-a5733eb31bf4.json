If the case succeeds, it will be the first time people with learning disabilities have won compensation for institutional abuse. Solicitors for 53 former residents of the homes have submitted a formal claim for compensation from Buckinghamshire county council. The men and women are said to have suffered appalling psychological trauma as a result of the abuse inflicted upon them at the homes. Lawyers acting for the council have denied liability for the abuse and its after-effects. The case is expected to be heard later this year. The claimants lived at two private residential homes in Stoke Poges, run by a company called Longcare. In 1994, a leaked county council report suggested that residents had been subjected to a horrific regime of abuse, mostly at the hands of the homes' proprietor, Gordon Rowe. The report described a catalogue of physical attacks, indecent assaults and rapes, financial exploitation, humiliation and neglect. It concluded: \"It is difficult to distil the information given and still convey the enormity and scale of humiliation, deprivation, torment and punishment to which the residents were subjected.\" Police launched an investigation after stories based on the report appeared in newspapers. Rowe committed suicide in March 1996, hours before he was due to be charged by police, but three former members of his staff - including his widow, Angela, who was jailed for 30 months - were subsequently convicted of offences of neglect and ill-treatment. An independent inquiry, headed by Tom Burgner, reported in 1998 and was highly critical of Buckinghamshire. Solicitors for the former residents claim that Gordon Rowe should never have been allowed to open his homes because the council knew he had previously been investigated for sexually abusing residents at a home in Somerset. The authority then allegedly failed over 10 years to detect the abusive regime in the homes because inspection and enforcement regimes were inadequate and complaints were not acted upon. June Raybaud, a barrister who chairs Justice for Longcare Survivors, a group set up by families of the homes' ex-residents, says: \"Buckinghamshire should have settled many years ago, and we are very, very sorry that they have not cooperated in this and alleviated the stress that the parents and relatives have been put under for so long.\" In a statement, Buckinghamshire says: \"In 1998, the council apologised to residents and their families for the mistakes made by the inspection unit in 1993. We very much regret that they occurred. Any claim for compensation will be dealt with on our behalf by our insurance company.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
