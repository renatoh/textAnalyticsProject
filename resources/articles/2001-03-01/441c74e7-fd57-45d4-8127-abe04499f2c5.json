I'm a 25-year-old pom (born and brought up in Birmingham and London) who's been living in Auckland for the past 12 months. I've been enjoying your travels vicariously for weeks and weeks, and thought I'd drop you a quick line to say that if you'd like a home cooked meal and/or tour of Auckland whilst you are here, do let me know. If I don't hear from you, have a great time - NZ is a wonderful country. My advice - Rotorua is overrated, the Bay of Islands aren't, Hawkes Bay is beautiful, Wellington is difficult to get to grips with, Nelson and Able Tasman are truly divine. Have fun and keep safe Andrea"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
