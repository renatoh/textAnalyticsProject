Post offices and schools closed, airlines cancelled flights, and buses and trains stood idle as the four-hour general strike took hold nationwide. Italy's three largest and most powerful unions had called the strike and organised some 100 demonstrations in piazzas across the country. Big festive crowds gathered in Rome, Bologna and Naples, where rallies were headed by union leaders and centre-left politicians. The Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, and his coalition government want to prevent people retiring before they have made 40 years of contributions to the pension system or reached a minimum age of 65 for men and 60 for women. At the moment, Italians can retire at 57 if they have paid into the system for 35 years. With the economy in recession, the protests have come at a difficult time for Mr Berlusconi. In 1994 his short-lived government collapsed soon after 1 million people took to the streets to protest against another attempt at reforming pensions taken by Berlusconi. However, this time all his coalition partners have signed up to the reform and look certain to weather the storm. \"We say this reform cannot be amended. It must be scrapped,\" union leader Savino Pezzotta told thousands of protesters in Rome. \"Today's strike is our first important signal, which cannot be ignored.\" The rally in Rome saw protesters march through the city's cobblestone streets and gather in Piazza Navona. \"I believe the pension cut is unfair, not so much for me and my generation, but for that of our children,\" said Daniele Venturi, a 44-year-old public employee who was on his way to the rally. Commuters faced disruption as buses, subways and trams stopped in Rome and across the country, with times varying from place to place. Half of the country's trains were not running, and Alitalia cancelled over 150 flights were cancelled this afternoon. The airline also warned passengers that some 124 flights would be delayed or rerouted. Banks were closed this morning, while hospitals said they would only guarantee emergency services. Museums and archaeological sites, including Pompeii, warned visitors they would be forced to close their doors, and some movie theatres planned to shut down for late shows. Italy's last general strike was staged in April last year to protest government-proposed changes to Italy's labour law. Despite opposition from the unions, Mr Berlusconi has vowed to go ahead with his plans, and is aiming to push the pension package through parliament before the end of the year. Like France and Germany, Italy is trying to reform its pension system, which swallows about 15% of gross domestic product - one of the highest levels in Europe. That proportion is set to grow as low birth rates and longer life expectancy age the country's population. Unions argue that a 1995 reform was enough to avert any crisis abd insist Italy's system is perfectly sustainable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
