The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has published the second stage of its \u201creturn to training\u201d guidance for elite athletes \u2013 the Covid-19 guidelines all sports must follow if they aim to return to competition behind closed doors, should circumstances allow, after 1 June. Watford\u2019s Troy Deeney and N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 of Chelsea are two high-profile footballers who have already opted out of training, even in the non-contact stage. Both did so with the support of their club coaches \u2013 but organisations such as the international football players\u2019 union, Fifpro, have expressed concern that athletes could be pressured into training against their wills. The new guidance addresses those concerns, stating: \u201cAll athletes and staff should be clear on their route to \u2018opt out\u2019 of the stage-two training environment at any time, without any resulting discrimination not associated with the potential natural competitive impact resulting from any loss of training time.\u201d The seven-page document contains eight broad points of guidance. Points 2-4 relate to the necessity of risk assessment at a training ground, the development of a strategy to minimise those risks and the process of communicating that strategy to athletes and staff. Points 5-8 deal with the response to possible infection; from monitoring testing levels \u201cto mitigate the increased risks that come with close contact training\u201d, to the application of quarantine rules and notification of contact tracing services in the event of a positive test. The final section of the document advises on insurance liability, another area of concern among athletes and medical staff. The guidance reads: \u201cHosts/operators of venues being used for stage two return to training should take active steps to ensure that close-contact training, coaching and support within their facility does not invalidate their relevant insurance.\u201d The guidance was devised by a working group that included DCMS, public health officials and medical staff from across elite sports. The Premier League\u2019s medical adviser, Dr Mark Gillett, was part of the group and it is now expected that the league will put its own stage-two guidelines to clubs for their potential approval at a shareholders\u2019 meeting on Tuesday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
