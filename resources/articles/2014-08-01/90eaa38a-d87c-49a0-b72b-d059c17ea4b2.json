Anyone who saw it then will go to this revival with the trepidation of someone setting off to visit an old love. Will Kevin Elyot's tripping-off-the-tongue, snagging-at-the-heart play have faded? Will it, like Look Back in Anger, be a once-hailed breakthrough that now seems a bore? Not a bit of it. In Robert Hastie's first-rate production, Elyot's portrait of five friends, all men, all gay, never ceases to scintillate. It begins with a housewarming in the 1980s; the toasts are to sodomy and gross indecency. It glides through two further meetings after funerals. It pretends it knows what dull is, but even a character meant to be a bore is so well observed that he becomes mesmeric in his pernickety obsession with conservatories; Richard Cant performs him with wistful desiccation. He and his well-endowed bus conductor partner (the cocky Matt Bardock) are on the edge of a group of friends who adore and betray each other. They are indelibly present: Geoffrey Streatfeild, dandyish and desperate; Julian Ovenden, lolling and slowly revealing; Jonathan Broadbent, blinking and knitting, liked and wanting to be loved; Lewis Reeves, a shimmering man-magnet. The person who is absent is the person who is present in all their minds: Reg, who has had nigh on all of them, not always under his own name. The word that is not said is Aids. It hovers over everyone. Vivacity is fringed with loss. Kevin Elyot died in June. Yet in My Night With Reg he makes time skip and stand still, disrupting expectations by bleeding one scene into another. He captures a moment when a group of friends could be out and proud \u2013 in a way they could not have been before the Wolfenden report a generation earlier \u2013 and then put under threat. Robert Hastie's vivid production should make his name as a director. He recreates the period while making the play seem new-minted. It's a glorious time trick, worthy of Elyot, who apparently left a final play, Twilight Song, that has never been staged. What is happening to it? \u2022 Until 27 September.
