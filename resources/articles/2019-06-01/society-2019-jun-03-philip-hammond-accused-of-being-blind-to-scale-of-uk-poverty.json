The report by the UN\u2019s rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, said 14 million people in the UK live in poverty and 1.5 million are destitute. It claimed the government\u2019s \u201cpunitive, mean-spirited, and often callous\u201d austerity policies were often intended to bring about social re-engineering. On Monday, Hammond balked at the claims, saying: \u201cI reject the idea that there are vast numbers of people facing dire poverty in this country. I don\u2019t accept the UN rapporteur\u2019s report at all. I think that\u2019s a nonsense. Look around you; that\u2019s not what we see in this country.\u201d He told the BBC\u2019s Newsnight programme: \u201cOf course, there are people struggling with the cost of living. I understand that. But the point is that we are addressing these things through getting to the root causes.\u201d Responding to his claims, the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said Hammond was insulated from the effects of his government\u2019s policies because of his wealth and denounced him for callousness. \u201cMultimillionaire Hammond lives in a different world to the rest of us. He displays a brutal complacency about the scale of poverty and human suffering his austerity programme has created,\u201d McDonnell said. \u201cHeartless, without compassion or any sense of humanity, after these remarks he demonstrates he is not fit to hold office and should consider his position. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the United Nations; Human Rights Watch and others have commented on the poverty and inequality under this government. Meanwhile, Philip Hammond\u2019s colleagues compete with each other to promise more tax cuts, showing how utterly out of touch the Conservatives are with the problems of today\u2019s society.\u201d In the report released last month, Alston said the UK had violated its human rights obligations through sustained and widespread cuts to social support. He said the scale of poverty in the UK was \u201cpatently unjust and contrary to British values\u201d and labelled it a \u201cpolitical choice\u201d, rather than an economic necessity. On Monday, a source close to Hammond said: \u201cThe chancellor was referring to Philip Alston\u2019s report on poverty, which others in government have described as \u2018barely believable\u2019 documentation and based on a short period of time in this country. It doesn\u2019t reflect where we are now, with the number of people in absolute poverty falling \u2026 since 2010, nor does it paint an accurate picture of our approach to poverty.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
