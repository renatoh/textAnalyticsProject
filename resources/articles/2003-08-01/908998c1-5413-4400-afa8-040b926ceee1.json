The early driving force behind the Welshman's career, the 74-year-old Harold died 10 days ago and the funeral will take place in Oswestry on Thursday. Woosnam, the 1991 US Masters champion, paid tribute to his farmer father in his autobiography, saying he had learned everything about the value of a good work ethic from him. \"Dad drummed into me at an early age that the only way to be the best at anything was to work much harder than anyone else,\" said the 45-year-old former world No1. Woosnam's father sold his stock of cherished pedigree dairy cattle in 1975 to switch to arable farming in an attempt to support his son's burgeoning golf career. Ten years earlier Harold Woosnam had taken up golf and introduced his seven-year-old son to the game after being impressed by an exhibition match between the 1951 British Open champion Max Faulkner, Harold Weetman and Ken Bousfield. Harold went on to become captain of the local Llanmynech Golf Club, which unusually features 15 holes in Wales and three in England. Ian Woosnam has won 29 titles on the European Tour and became world No1 on April 7, 1991, a week before his victory in the Masters. Though in the twilight of his playing career, he is determined to play his way on to Bernhard Langer's European Ryder Cup team for next year. - Reuters"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
