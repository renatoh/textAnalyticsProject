And for what you do. STAY SAFE.\u201d Since the 2012 Sandy Hook elementary school shooting, conspiracy theorists who claim grieving family members of shooting victims are \u201ccrisis actors\u201d, and that mass shootings are staged to advance gun control, have continued to harass victims\u2019 families. This confrontation is sometimes very direct: a Florida woman was sentenced to five months in prison for sending threatening messages for one Sandy Hook father that death was coming for him \u201creal soon\u201d. New theories targeting family members of the most recent victims emerge immediately after each high-profile shooting, and generate online and in-person harassment. The emails from Richardson, who was using his official NRA email address, emerged as part of a defamation lawsuit by Sandy Hook parents against the Infowars host Alex Jones, who used his show to air Sandy Hook conspiracy theories. Wolfgang Halbig, the conspiracy theorist Richardson emailed, has contributed to Infowars. The same day Richardson emailed Halbig, the Infowars site published a post alleging that a second shooter had been reported in the Parkland attack, HuffPost found. In one of several Sandy Hook parent lawsuits, in which Halbig is named as a defendant, a complaint alleges that Halbig has made at least 22 trips to Connecticut to \u201cinvestigate\u201d the shooting, that he deluged officials with public records requests and that when a father asked him to leave victims\u2019 families alone, the man was informed: \u201cWolfgang does not want to speak with you unless you exhume [you son\u2019s] body and prove to the world you lost your son.\u201d The NRA spokesman, Andrew Arulanandam, did not respond to multiple requests for comment to clarify Richardson\u2019s role within the organization, or whether the NRA has policies about employees promoting mass-shooting conspiracy theories. Richardson\u2019s name is listed on an NRA website as a \u201ctraining counselor program coordinator\u201d in the organization\u2019s education and training division. A spokeswoman for the NRA\u2019s political arm did not comment on the specifics of Richardson\u2019s emails, but said that \u201cany suggestion\u201d that the Sandy Hook shooting was faked was \u201cinsane\u201d. \u201cSandy Hook was a horrific tragedy, and any suggestion that the unspeakable atrocities committed by an evil lunatic were faked as part of an elaborate hoax are insane,\u201d Jennifer Baker, of the NRA\u2019s Institute for Legislative Action, wrote in an email on Thursday. \u201cThe men and women of the National Rifle Association grieve for the innocent people who were killed, the families ripped apart, and the entire Sandy Hook community.\u201d Halbig suggested in a separate email to friends in early 2018 that he had been trying to get in touch with the NRA for four years, and that Richardson\u2019s email was the first contact he had had with the organization, HuffPost reported. In a statement to HuffPost, Richardson defended his email as raising a \u201clegitimate question\u201d. He did not respond to a request for further comment via his official NRA email address, which was still active as of Thursday afternoon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
