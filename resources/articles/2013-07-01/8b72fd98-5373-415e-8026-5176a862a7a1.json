D-day will come even sooner for the Olympic long jump champion, Greg Rutherford, who will undergo final tests on Monday morning to assess whether he has recovered from an injury to his right hamstring. He will know by midnight whether he has been selected. By then most of the GB squad for Moscow, currently 61 strong, will have arrived in their training camp in Barcelona as they hone, tweak and tinker before travelling to Russia next week. However, Ennis-Hill remains unsure whether she will join them. After competing in the 100m hurdles and long jump on Saturday, Ennis-Hill sounded deflated with her performances, warning: \"I don't want to go and not be ready, not be competitive. I've got more to lose than to gain, so I want to go there and be a contender.\" Understandably she was particularly disappointed with her 100m hurdles time of 13.08sec, more than half a second down on her 12.54 personal best at London 2012. But the hurdles is not a race in which an athlete can find rhythm with a click of the fingers. Ennis-Hill's injured achilles tendon prevented her from hurdling for six weeks from early June. Only in the past week has that changed. It was also a worry that Ennis-Hill seemed to lack her usual dynamic spring during the long jump. Her best effort of 6.16m was 35cm down on London 2012. The rust was obvious. The question is whether she has time to scrape it off. But if Ennis-Hill needed inspiration she had only to listen to the Olympic and world 100m hurdles champion, Sally Pearson, who won the race in 12.65. Last year the Australian seemed indestructible but she too has struggled this season, after suffering a hamstring injury. \"Everyone told me to be patient and believe in myself and that's what I've done,\" she said. \"I'm Olympic and world champion and I'm still showing up and getting defeated but I've waited for my turn and it came out my way.\" A couple of days' distance may have given Ennis-Hill a broader perspective. Her achilles tendon stood up to two trials of strength. A few days of hard grind before Sunday, when she is scheduled to compete in a low-key women's league match in Kingston, could yet make a difference. There may still be time. Meanwhile Rutherford, who has surprised UK Athletics doctors with his rate of improvement since pulling his right hamstring at the Diamond League meeting in Paris on 6 July, will find out on Monday whether he is fit for Moscow. If he does not make it, the joint British record holder, Chris Tomlinson, will get the nod. But Tomlinson, after finishing fifth with a leap of 7.99m on Saturday, said he feared that reputation would trump form \u2013 and Rutherford would be selected. \"I think on current form and on current shape I'd be on the team but obviously he's got the gold medal last year and that has to be taken into account,\" he said. \"But I believe I could go there and get a medal, no doubt about that.\" The final member of Britain's Super Saturday triumvirate, Mo Farah, who won so impressively in the 3,000m on Saturday, has confirmed he will be back on the track in 2014 despite suggestions to the contrary. \"100% I'll be back on the track and hopefully in 2014 [stepping] up to a marathon,\" he said. \"When I'm done [with the track] I'll tell you but it's been misunderstood.\" Farah also floated the possibility of a rare 10,000m-marathon double at Rio 2016. \"The 10,000m is first and then the marathon is right at the end, so it gives you a bit of time to recover,\" he said. \"It has been done. It will just depend how I am. \"It's something I would like to do \u2013 it would be great to do it \u2013 but you can't get excited about it. You've just got to take one year at a time and one race at a time.\" Ed Warner, the chairman of UK Athletics, said he was \"pleased and relieved\" that the three-day Anniversary Games had been such a success. \"We have put on an event on a scale we have never contemplated before,\" he said. \"And it's come together extremely well. The weather has helped. Some extremely good performances have helped. It shows how much the public holds athletics in great esteem.\" Warner said the decision over whether to stage next year's Diamond League meeting at a range of venues around London, including The Mall and Horse Guards Parade, or at Hampden Park would be decided before November's IAAF deadline. And then he pledged that, whatever happened, UK Athletics was determined to carry the momentum of London 2012 up to the world championships in 2017. \"I believe we deserve to be rightly chastised if we let it fall through our fingers,\" he said. \"I don't want athletics to be regarded as a once-in-every-four-years event.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
