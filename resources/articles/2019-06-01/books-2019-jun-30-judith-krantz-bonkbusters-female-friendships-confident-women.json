Krantz was the \u201cqueen of the bonkbuster\u201d, those glitzy novels with their gaudy covers and snappy often one-word titles \u2013 Scruples, Lace, Rivals \u2013 that dominated commercial fiction in the late 1970s and 1980s, spinning stories of fabulous lives lived at full tilt and stuffed full of sex, secrets and shopping. As a teenager, I thrilled to those books: to Krantz\u2019s Scruples, in which her formidable heroine, Billy Ikehorn (nee Winthrop), essentially anticipated the hipster shopping experience by about two decades, opening the shop that gave the book its title, a perfect pleasuredome with an on-site bar in which women tried on shoes and sipped champagne while their husbands drank beer and played backgammon; to Shirley Conran\u2019s Lace, every 80s schoolgirl\u2019s most feverish fantasy (just ask them about the notorious goldfish scene), in which four women meet at an elite Swiss finishing school before going on to conquer the worlds of fashion, publishing, journalism and (more randomly) charity fundraising; and to Jilly Cooper\u2019s Rivals, which gave the genre a very British spin by having her heroes compete for an ITV franchise while fitting in the odd game of naked tennis. It might seem like a stretch to claim that everything I\u2019ve ever learned I learned from bonkbusters, and yet in an odd way it\u2019s true. Their initial appeal might lie in their almost fairytale glamour \u2013 there was a reason the late, great Jackie Collins set her books largely in Hollywood, where both the stakes and the stars were high. It was a chance to escape the humdrum reality of life \u2013 particularly teenage pre-internet life where the hours stretched on for days \u2013 by diving into a luxurious world filled with backstabbing and betrayal, where women were asked \u201cwhich one of you bitches is my mother?\u201d, and glamorous but down-at-heel progeny of white Russian princes-in-exile were forced to get ahead in advertising on their own. But behind all the Ritz and romance \u2013 Krantz\u2019s heroines in particular were fond of a good wedding or three \u2013 something more interesting was going on. Critics often sneer at these books as vacuous and stuffed full of \u201ctrivial\u201d concerns such as clothes, shoes and makeup (the wonderfully acerbic Angela Carter memorably described reading Krantz as like \u201cbeing sealed inside a luxury shopping mall whilst being softly pelted with scented sex technique manuals\u201d), yet they are also part of a rich tradition of novels which place women\u2019s interior lives and, most importantly, their sexual desires centre-stage, and, crucially, they are usually, although not always, at their heart about female friendship. Thus Lace might have a reputation as the steamiest bonkbuster of them all, a novel filled with lovingly described scenes of sex and masturbation, with erotic encounters with Swiss ski instructors, playboy princes and men about town, but no one ever really remembers the men. Instead, this is a book about the friendship between its four heroines, Maxine, Judy, Pagan and Kate, a friendship built around a secret child and intended to see them through thick and thin (or \u201csick and sin\u201d as the French Maxine rather more realistically has it). It is also a determinedly feminist book. Conran\u2019s real interest lies not in her heroine\u2019s marriages but in their careers, and she reserves her most lovingly detailed passages for those moments when Judy pulls off a publishing coup or Kate sneaks across the border into a war zone. Her teenage readers might have come for that goldfish but they left convinced that with the right combination of gumption and moxie and, more importantly, with the support of their friends, then any career was there for the taking. Similarly Princess Daisy, Krantz\u2019s second novel and my favourite, is as much about heroine Daisy\u2019s friendship with \u201cauto industry heiress\u201d Kiki Kavanaugh, always present with a quick quip, as it is about her desire to support and protect her twin sister Danielle, who suffered a brain injury during their birth. And while both Daisy and Kiki are heiresses, they are heiresses who work, with Daisy, estranged from her family thanks to her spectacularly evil half-brother Ram, paying Dani\u2019s medical bills by working as runner on a TV production company and painting society portraits on the side. For underneath the froth, these were books written by women who not only understood the ways in which women\u2019s lives were changing but who were eager to capture those changes on the page. Women such as Rona Jaffe, celebrated for her classic \u201cgirls in the city\u201d novel The Best of Everything (1958), who would go on to write 1979\u2019s Class Reunion, which followed four women from their time at Radcliffe College through bad marriages and by-and-large better careers to their college reunion 20 years later. And Lisa Alther, whose Kinflicks, published in 1976, told the riotous coming-of-age of Ginny Babcock, teen renegade turned sorority sister, lesbian, suburban mother and more. As the 80s progressed, so the bonkbuster began to spread in different directions. Barbara Taylor Bradford created the self-made woman par excellence with A Woman of Substance, Penny Vincenzi combined tight plots with a flair for characterisation in a string of hits from Old Sins to A Question of Trust, and June Flaum Singer threw the kitchen sink at it with The Movie Set, which came with the irresistible tagline \u201cThey started out as five nice girls, but nice girls don\u2019t survive in The Movie Set\u201d. Best of all, perhaps, was Sally Beauman, who hit the headlines when her debut Destiny, a racy sex-stuffed tale of forbidden love, was the subject of a million-pound advance, and who would go on to write Dark Angel, an addictive blend of family house saga, mystery and secret desires which offered new possibilities for the genre. But its queens saw no need to change. Krantz gave us I\u2019ll Take Manhattan, in which Maxi Amberville, who at 29 \u201chas already discarded three husbands on two continents\u201d, bends the magazine industry to her will, Collins introduced the all-conquering Lucky Santangelo, mob daughter and Lady Boss long before the notion was an internet meme, and Cooper turned her eye to the worlds of polo, music and art while still ensuring that her heroes and heroines were only ever one sultry Cotswold evening away from stripping off and getting to it. And that perhaps was the lesson that the best bonkbusters delivered. There\u2019s none of the fey whimpering from the shadows of a Fifty Shades here, instead \u2013 whether writing about friendships, work or sex \u2013 these books celebrated women. They told their audience that those relationships, careers and desires were both worthwhile and wonderful, and they made their readers feel they could be wonderful too. They weren\u2019t perfect by any means, \u2013 many have a near-pathological obsession with \u201cthe perfect weight\u201d and there are crude insults that jar on re-reads \u2013 but the greatest of them, from Beauman and Conran to Vincenzi and Taylor Bradford, tell women not to hide in the shadows but to stand proudly centre stage. It is for that confidence \u2013 or as a bonkbuster heroine would have it, that brio \u2013 that Krantz in particular will be missed. Page turners Valley of the Dolls Jaqueline Susann, 1966 \u201cShe doesn\u2019t write, she types\u201d bitched Gore Vidal, but Susann\u2019s Hollywood tale is an unputdownable story of fame, excess and addiction. Scruples Judith Krantz, 1978 Krantz\u2019s debut tells of ugly duckling Billy Winthrop and her rise to fashion glory thanks to \u2026 weight loss, secretarial skills and the decision to open luxury shop Scruples. The Debutantes June Flaum Singer, 1982 Flaum Singer drew loose inspiration from the life of the late Gloria Vanderbilt in this over-the-top story of four close friends. Lace Shirley Conran, 1984 Famous for its opening \u2013 \u201cwhich one of you bitches is my mother?\u201d \u2013 Conran\u2019s tale is really a feminist saga of friendship and ambition. Sundowners Lesley Lokko, 2003 Lokko dragged the blockbuster into the 21st century with this addictive story of four boarding school friends which mixes astute commentary on race and politics amid the glamour."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
