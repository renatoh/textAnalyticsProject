These were his first goals for Bradford, and also on the scoresheet for them was Dean Windass. Another excellent substitute performance was at Rotherham, where Southend's Wayne Gray was brought into the action seven minutes from the end, with Rotherham having fought back from 2-0 down to 2-2. He responded to the challenge by putting them ahead again and then making it 4-2 with a penalty awarded for a foul on him by Shaun Barker. Nottingham Forest's improvement since the return of Jack Lester to their team following a nine-month absence was maintained with a 1-1 draw against the leaders, Swansea. It could have been even better for Forest because Lester, the star of their wins in their two previous matches, put them ahead. However, Robert Martinez equalised. Bristol City's first match following the appointment of Gary Johnson as manager brought a 3-2 win at Brentford - only their second victory of the season. MK Dons would be happy with just one. Beaten 3-2 at Blackpool, they are still the only team without a victory."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
