But despite a campaign launched in the 1980s, there is still no convention on the rights of people with disabilities. An estimated 600m people worldwide have a disability, eight in 10 of whom are in developing countries. Of them, 82% live below the poverty line. For campaigners demanding a convention, disability seems to be the final frontier of equality. The profile of the campaign will be boosted tomorrow by a conference in London of global disability activists. The event has been organised by International Service (IS), a York-based agency, which says it sees disabled people routinely excluded from mainstream development processes in the countries where it sends volunteers. Representatives of disability groups in Africa, Palestine and Latin America are being flown to London by IS to discuss how to build coalitions and enlist the support of governments, including Britain's. Campaigners believe that discrimination against disabled people, and breaches of their human rights, are issues not adequately addressed by the UN standard rules on equalisation of opportunities for those with disabilities. These rules state what governments \"should\" do to ensure that disabled people can participate equally in all areas of life, including education, medical care, employment and the family. But activists argue that the rules lack clout because they are not legally binding. By contrast, member states have to report to the UN on the progress they make on ratified conventions. This enables civil rights organisations to monitor their government's actions and demand accountability. As UN human rights committees do not currently deal with disability abuses, documenting the level and nature of such abuse is difficult. This gap has prompted a British organisation, Disability Awareness in Action (DAA), to invite disabled people to send in testimonies for a human rights database. It has recorded abuses affecting more than 2m disabled people and claims that almost a quarter of victims have endured a breach of article three of the UN declaration of human rights, which states that \"everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person\". In addition, more than a fifth had been subjected to \"torture or . . . cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\" in breach of article five of the declaration. Richard Light, DAA's research director, says: \"Existing rules have failed to prevent prejudiced attitudes. Doctors, for example, are still withholding treatment from disabled people because the underlying attitude is 'better dead than disabled'. Even among many human rights monitoring organisations, abuses in mental health institutions, such as the use of ECT [electro-convulsive therapy] without consent, are seen as medical issues and not to do with human rights.\" Light acknowledges that a convention has limitations - there is no international court to enforce it - but says it would be \"an official and formal recognition that disabled people are human beings\". The path to a UN convention, as past campaigns prove, is long and arduous. Jane Carter, chief executive of IS, points out that the drive for a convention on the rights of the child lasted more than 60 years. \"We hope it doesn't take that long,\" she says of the goal of a disability convention, \"but it has got to be raised again and again.\" Richard Howitt, a Labour MEP and president of the EU all-party disability intergroup, suggests that the campaign is hampered by a perception of disability rights as non-political and therefore uncontroversial. \"It's been seen as a charity issue, which means it's not a priority,\" he says. \"It's been treated in a patronising and paternalistic way\". Howitt, who will address the conference, says it was a major breakthrough when the EU agreed to include action against disability discrimination in the 1997 Amsterdam treaty. \"All the wise owls of Europe said: 'You'll never include disability' - and we did. It was all down to clever lobbying and political campaigning.\" But, he adds, the EU does not extend disability rights into policy-making. \"If we had a convention, it would have to inform thinking in areas such as justice, asylum and foreign affairs.\" Member states are \"very nervous\" about a UN convention, Howitt admits. But he is optimistic that it will come. \"It's a matter of time, rather than if it will happen.\" Ireland has taken a pro-convention lead within the UN. Eamonn MacAodha, first secretary at the Irish mission to the UN and also a speaker at the conference, says: \"The issue is so important, it does merit a separate convention. But while countries such as South Africa support it, relatively few western nations do.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
