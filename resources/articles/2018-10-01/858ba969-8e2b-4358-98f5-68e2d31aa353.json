Still, it was impossible to ignore the proving of people wrong when Europe\u2019s successful captain pinpointed a key reason behind Sunday\u2019s victory in Paris. \u201cThe picks,\u201d said Bj\u00f8rn immediately on Monday morning. The selection of that quartet \u2013 Paul Casey, Sergio Garc\u00eda, Ian Poulter and Henrik Stenson \u2013 led to allegations of an old pals\u2019 act on the part of the captain, specifically in the case of the out-of-form Garc\u00eda. The delivery of a combined 9\u00bd points, the best aggregate in Ryder Cup history, meant there was more substance to the process than Bj\u00f8rn had earlier been given credit for. \u201cThey delivered,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was not down to me; it was down to them. They wanted to deliver.\u201d The Dane, now rightly heralded among Europe\u2019s finest captains, revealed his wildcards had no cause to be surprised when their places were confirmed. \u201cI put plans together with them,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt was so much easier for me to put plans together with them because I know them so well. I could have conversations with them and know how they work, what they do, what makes them tick, what makes them do the right things coming into it, so we could out-lay plans for them and then go with that. That\u2019s more to Henrik and Sergio than the other two. Paul, when he decided to come back and play in Europe, played in our EurAsia Cup team. That week I spent with him there did so much for him and for me in the way that I knew that he could fit into a team in a really good way.\u201d Bj\u00f8rn added: \u201cI told Henrik: \u2018Be prepared to play two foursomes. You might play more but be prepared to play two foursomes.\u2019 He goes and delivers three points out of three at 42. It\u2019s a pretty impressive thing to do when you\u2019ve not had the greatest of seasons. With Sergio I felt if I could give him a pick, then that would boost him to go on and do things. I was pushing him. I kept pushing him to making him feel like he needed to do the work. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to remember, he\u2019s now the all-time leading points scorer for Europe. Even if he had not won any points here, he\u2019s still won a lot of Ryder Cup points. That takes some doing because we\u2019ve had some really good players that\u2019s won a lot of Ryder Cups. It says a lot about him. I think this will kick him on to do great things next season.\u201d There was no denying Europe\u2019s star man. Francesco Molinari, the Open champion, showed his single-mindedness when opting to play in the PGA Tour\u2019s John Deere Classic rather than in Europe immediately before his triumph at Carnoustie. \u201cI was a bit like, is this the right move?\u201d Bj\u00f8rn recalled. \u201cI spoke to him about it and he was like: \u2018Well, I have to do this for how my year\u2019s planning out,\u2019 so I said to him: \u2018I\u2019m a little bit worried about it because I really want you to be on this team.\u2019 I really did on this golf course because I thought it suited him perfectly. For me it would be a perfect foursomes opportunity on this golf course. \u201cI had the conversation with him and he said: \u2018For me I have to do this but I promise you I will make the team.\u2019 I got a message on the Sunday night after the Open saying: \u2018Is this good enough?\u2019 \u201cHe\u2019s just gone on from strength to strength since. He\u2019s such an underrated player and he has been for a long time. Now that he\u2019s got the confidence that he has as a golfer, he can do anything. He showed that this week. He\u2019s phenomenal. He took on the best players in the world \u2013 he is one of the best players in the world \u2013 and he showed he\u2019s equal to the task.\u201d There was far more to Bj\u00f8rn\u2019s expert planning. Conscious that the Ryder Cup could be decided by the final singles matches, he played video messages from Colin Montgomerie, Paul McGinley, Graeme McDowell and Martin Kaymer to his team. That quartet secured the Ryder Cup from late Sunday positions in 1997, 2002, 2010 and 2012 respectively. \u201cThose guys told the story about what they experienced,\u201d Bj\u00f8rn added. Sports science and medical strategy was put in place to a fresh, detailed level. \u201cIf you had tried that in 2002, the nutritionist wouldn\u2019t have got far,\u201d said the captain with a smile.Bj\u00f8rn is perfectly happy to admit a 17.5 to 10.5 thumping by Europe was beyond his wildest dreams. \u201cIf you sit and home and think that\u2019s a score, that would be borderline arrogant against that team,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a time on Sunday where it looked like 14.5 to 13.5 on the prediction. \u201cOnce it kind of pans out that we have won it, it goes a bit flat for the Americans. I thought it was tight and I thought it was going to be really tight. We knew we had to be at our best to win it.\u201d As further evidence of disharmony within the United States camp appeared, pictures emerged of a typically boisterous scene at a European victory party, where Nick Grimshaw delivered a DJ set. Earlier Bj\u00f8rn\u2019s team members had formed a WhatsApp group to exchange motivational messages; an image of Justin Thomas wearing a T-shirt with \u2018Beat Europe\u2019 emblazoned across the front is known to have featured. Bj\u00f8rn is not yet clear what the future holds, such was his commitment to this cause. \u201cI\u2019m going to enjoy the next two months,\u201d he said. \u201cI might have to wait until we get into 2019 to make any concrete decisions on what I\u2019m doing next but right now I just want to go and lie on a bed for a few weeks.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
