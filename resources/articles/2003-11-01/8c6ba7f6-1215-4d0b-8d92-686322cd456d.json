His argument was for a change of priorities in purchasing modern art with public budgets, but not to the detriment of saving old masterpieces. Jake Chapman, artist It's obvious, isn't it? They're turning art into the crown jewels. This is really a domestic argument. It's symptomatic of the struggle between the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie, trying to free money up for their own interests. If I had \u00a325m I'd buy a helicopter and a swimming pool. The idea of \"buying art\" is a strange one, the idea of possessing something that is necessarily so promiscuous. It wouldn't even occur to me. As far as saving art for the nation goes, I don't have a molecule of nationalistic feeling, and the thought of keeping \u00a325m from a pretty impoverished country would require pretty extenuating circumstances. Brian Sewell, art critic, the Evening Standard If I had \u00a325m I certainly wouldn't spend it on that Raphael - I just don't think it's by Raphael. The idea of us spending that amount of money on something that sooner or later is going to be recognised as a dud is completely preposterous. It is the responsibility of the National Art Collections Fund to \"save\" things. That is why it was set up, and it is a private organisation. It is not its job to buy modern crap for the Tate. It is the Tate's job to persuade the government to give them enough money for an acquisition fund so that they can buy as much modern crap as they like. Serota's speech did demonstrate what a lousy judge of art he is - he extolled Andrew Lloyd Webber's collection of Victorian art, which is complete trash. Matthew Slotover, Frieze art magazine This issue about filling holes in collections is a difficult one - why have another French romantic painter when you could have a German one? But you're never going to get a collection that is complete. I think perhaps the distribution of money could be skewed towards more contemporary works. But it is possible to do it on a small budget, by buying works of important artists while they're still young. With that kind of money you could buy an awful lot of contemporary art. If I was going to spend \u00a325m, I would try for Rachel Whiteread's Ghost. It's a key work by one of the major British artists of the past 100 years, but Charles Saatchi picked it up for a few thousand pounds. Timothy Clifford, National Galleries of Scotland I would go straight to the Duke of Sutherland and ask for something from his collection, probably the Seven Sacraments by Poussin, and hope that the rest of it would be sorted out through tax. It wouldn't go an awful long way. The most important thing at the moment is that the government provides more money and also more tax breaks. Adrian Searle, art critic, the Guardian It's absurd to have this notion of saving works for the country, but I'm an extremely unpatriotic person. Does it mean that all Titians should go back to Venice? To spend the whole GDP of a developing country of a wormy canvas does seem somewhat obscene and I do baulk at the idea that the National Gallery just wants to round out its Raphael collection for this amount of money. What business does a museum have spending that sort of money? But the other problem is that a public institution that is strapped for cash is having to compete with a place like the Getty. I don't think there's any world-class killer artwork that someone is keeping in private that people really ought to see. As for what to spend \u00a325m on, it's meaningless to me, as long as people can go along and see it. Mark Jones, Victoria and Albert Museum The works caught by export controls will be those that have been in the country more than 50 years, and therefore reflective of the taste of collectors of some time ago. If, like Nick Serota, you are collecting contemporary art, then clearly you are interested in material that is too recent to be stopped. If I had \u00a325m we'd be able to have a rational programme of acquisition tackling some of the areas in which the V&amp;A is weak - for example 20th-century design. I couldn't possibly name my dream object. It would drive the price up before we could get hold of it. Jonathan Watkins, Ikon Gallery, Birmingham There is a lot of emphasis on what is British and what is historical, and it would be great if we could counterbalance that with work that is modern, contemporary and international. Millions are being spent on what is a bit like a trophy. The Raphael might mean a lot to a curator but not so much to other audiences. We could be acquiring work that will mean a lot for future generations, because the contemporary will soon be historical. On Kawara is such an important figure internationally, in terms of conceptual art and influence on future generations, and he is not represented by any museum in this country. Britain is a wealthy place and it's a shame it's not more expansive in terms of its museum collections. Charles Saumarez Smith, National Gallery I agree in principle that all museums and galleries are suffering from not having enough money to spend on acquisitions. In the early 80s we had subsidised purchase grants and in the 90s the heritage lottery fund, but now we're having to restrict the flow to saving pieces, which inhibits our ability to acquire others. I'm not sure that the way to have more active purchasing of contemporary art is to reduce the other art we buy. Things are going through the marketplace all the time. Tristram Hunt, historian Completely agree with him. I have no problem spending that amount of private funds on a painting, because we should want to keep as much as possible in the UK, but spending public money is not acceptable given our other priorities. There is nothing wrong with national pride and a degree of nationalism, but it is questionable if you can affix that to this Raphael. If I had that money at my disposal I might spend it ensuring Bishop Auckland didn't lose its Zurbar\u00e1n paintings, or on the Victorian art from the Schaeffer collection, which actually tells a much more interesting story of Britishness. Susan Ferleger Brades, Hayward Gallery Too many galleries out of London have been disadvantaged because their buildings aren't in good enough condition to house major works of art. So if I could spend \u00a325m, I'd like to see wider distribution of work that's in this country, more proactive collecting from here and abroad and building up of galleries' infrastructure. I am in charge of the 7,500-strong Arts Council England collection. The unusual thing about that is that we buy only from living artists, and it now contains masterpieces of British contemporary art: Rileys, Bacons, Freuds, Kapoors, Gormleys. If I was given an opportunity to extend that, I would buy from artists in Asia, Latin and North America and Europe. Sandy Nairne, National Portrait Gallery Moments like the Madonna of the Pinks are exceptional. Of course you can't really say that that painting is worth \u00a325m or \u00a336m but, regrettably, that's the price of a Raphael on the art market. If I had \u00a325m I would create an endowment fund for the National Portrait Gallery and use the interest on it to acquire works for the nation, ensuring our future. Richard Wilson, artist It's true that the Tate doesn't have a lot of money - if it had more maybe it would buy one of my works. Seriously, though, if you run a museum I don't think you should be spending money on a lot of YBA-type work. Museums should be filled with things that are museum-worthy, that have been tried and tested over time. If I had \u00a325m I would buy a building and create a collection of art that no one else would show. I'd put in Barry Flanagan's Hole in the Sea; I'd put in earth works by Walter DeMaria, I'd put in some of the more difficult arte povera stuff, and something of mine. I'd have some material recording the way Gordon Matta-Clark worked, with some of his drawings and photomontages. A lot of it would be documentary material about ephemeral works. And I would commission a lot of work for the space. Virginia Tandy, Manchester Art Gallery Because there is a process for sharing the benefit of the Raphael acquisition around the country and giving people in Manchester access to it, this allows the regions to be much more supportive of these kinds of acquisitions. One has to exercise great judgement when purchasing contemporary art because reputations are always in a state of flux. We want to support artists we believe will be significant figures. That's very different from buying a historical work. Julian Treuherz, National Museums Liverpool When there is a limited amount of money at our disposal, it's very frustrating to have it constantly hijacked by heritage objects. British collections are very, very short on great works of modern art, and we've rather missed the boat with them now because the prices put them out of our reach. We don't have a Francis Bacon, but if I was spending the \u00a325m I would want to use a proportion to buy works only from the past five or 10 years. Serota was arguing that we don't look outside the things we've traditionally collected in this country. He wasn't just arguing for contemporary art, but for a balance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
