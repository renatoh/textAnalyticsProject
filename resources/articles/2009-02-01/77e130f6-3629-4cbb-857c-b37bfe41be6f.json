The news will be a considerable relief to fans of the Lancashire welterweight who were concerned when the channel posted on its own website last week a notice saying: \"The Cotto-Jennings fight is not confirmed as being shown on Setanta this weekend.\" This prompted an angry response from fans who inundated Setanta with complaints. Trevor East, Setanta's director of sport, said: \"Contrary to some news reports that Sports Network were refusing to sell the rights, it was simply a case of us agreeing terms. We are pleased that we have now been able to do that to everyone's satisfaction.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
