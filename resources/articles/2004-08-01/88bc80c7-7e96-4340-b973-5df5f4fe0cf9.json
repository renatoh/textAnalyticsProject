But last week's chaotic scenes were by far the worst I can remember, and provoked the most angry outcry from passengers and commentators. There was a quantum change in the reaction to the cancellations and near-anarchy at Heathrow. After the tragedy of September 11, the airline has had a huge fund of goodwill that has seen it through financial problems, thousands of job cuts and serious management failings. Last week, that goodwill seemed to have been spent, amid headlines that accurately reflected the travelling public's frustration at what has happened to BA. Suddenly, the airline seems on a par with the London Underground and the motorway system for public opprobrium. This is probably an over-reaction. As chief executive Rod Eddington points out, up to 2 per cent of flights are cancelled for a variety of reasons on a 'normal' day's flying. The problem last week was that they all hit Heathrow, our busiest airport, at the same time. It confirmed the worst suspicions that the 'Future Size and Shape' programme - which has seen 13,000 jobs go in three years - has cut the airline too close to the bone. And it makes a nonsense of BA's claim that, by paying a few pounds more, passengers can avoid the delays and ritual humiliation of the cut-price competition. Eddington says that the next couple of months will decide what the long-term implications are, and there is no doubting his determination to see the job through and get things right. But if he gets it wrong, it will take more than a stint behind the check-in counter to get him off the hook. The safe way for Crosby to acquire Abbey? The Abbey-Santander situation is being increasingly compared to last year's Morrison's-Safeway affair: an agreed bid, an uncertain reaction from the target's shareholders, and the possibility of a government probe if any of the other bid players get involved by tabling their own offers. In this scenario the apparent risk to HBOS, the bank most likely to table a counter-bid, is from a Competition Commission review that would take months, unsettle Abbey's business, and end up with HBOS getting approval to bid - but with serious conditions attached. Job losses, branch closures, sell-offs of overlapping areas of the business all threaten the financial mathematics of an HBOS-Abbey deal. A year on, this gloomy scenario goes, we could be reading about HBOS's first profits warning and a sliding share price. I don't see it that way. The alternative sequence of events could just as likely see a relatively quick and inexpensive victory for HBOS, with little of that downside: HBOS bids, Santander withdraws (as it has hinted), other potential bidders such as RBS, HSBC and Lloyds TSB get cold feet, and leave the way clear for HBOS. After arguing the toss with the authorities for a few months, James Crosby comes out of the Competition Commission relatively unscathed - a few minor adjustments, maybe - but essentially he gets the whole of the Abbey business at a good price. There are lots of ifs and buts, but the HBOS 'dream scenario' is a real possibility. As long as the Spanish are offering paper, which few shareholders want, the temptation for Crosby will grow more acute. Montague's comeback will test philosophy Welcome back, Robert Montague. The 56-year-old businessman and bon-vivant will this week return to the City after a 10-year absence - more or less enforced - with his Intermodal company. In the early Nineties, Montague was the original 'fat cat', long before the phrase was applied to businessmen. His company Tiphook (like Intermodal, in the container business) fell victim to tough times, and kicked out Montague and some of his pals. They insisted their three-year service contracts (remember them?) should be honoured in full, and walked away with more than \u00a36m. Montague subsequently went bankrupt (partly as a result of his underwriting rights issues to rescue Tiphook) and had to sell his yacht, as well as other treasured personal assets. He came out of bankruptcy seven years ago, determined to get back into the business he knows, and at which for a long time he was very successful. Intermodal will be more of the same - containers - but this time operating largely from the continent. If his past record is anything to go by, he will expand fast, through acquisition, and he deserves a chance. This government has tried to underpin its entrepreneurial credentials by seeking to remove the stigma of bankruptcy, with the message that we all deserve a second chance in business. Montague's return should be viewed as a test-case of that philosophy. The boys in the top band If further proof were needed of the 'glass ceiling' for Britain's businesswomen, it came with yesterday's survey by our sister paper, the Guardian , of executive pay rates. No female executives earned more than \u00a31 million, and even Marjorie Scardino, with a total package of \u00a3901,000, was some way off the 'magic million' club with its all-male membership of 187 executives. Of the 1,400 boardroom jobs going at Britain's top companies, 114 were held by women. So it's still a case of jobs - and the big bucks - for the boys."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
