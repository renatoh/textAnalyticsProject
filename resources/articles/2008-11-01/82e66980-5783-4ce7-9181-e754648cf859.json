Sarah Palin, it seemed, didn't know Africa was a continent. Nor was she sure of the countries that made up the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), or by extension, or more basically, what constituted North America. \"Unnamed sources\" leaked Palin's lacunae to the Fox News channel, which dutifully reported the breaking news. Chris Matthews spent nearly his entire episode of Hardball on the subject. Slate writers debated whether it was fair to discuss it; National Review editors rose to her defence claiming it was a \"fumble of words\", as she was an \"instinctive internationalist\". Even holding the conversation gave legitimacy to it. There was an underlying suspicion that the \"Wasilla hillbillies\", as Newsweek reported a \"senior\" McCain aide called Palin and her family (who \"looted Neiman Marcus\" from \"coast to coast\"), didn't have a clue as to the lower 48 states, let alone Africa. Palin herself made it worse, claiming the comments must have been \"taken out of context\" regarding her debate prep. (Even she was afraid she'd made the mistake!) And yet the original leak was a hoax, as the New York Times exposed last night. Set up by a fake rightwing adviser to the campaign who also seems to have been behind the rumours that Joe the Plumber was hooking up with members of the Saturday Night Live team, as well as a host of other plausible and semi-plausible, and not-plausible-at-all-but-taken-as real leaks during the campaign. He even had a faux-BBC interview series he posted to his site. \"Martin Eisenstadt\" \u2013 aka actor Eitan Gorlin on screen backed by Dan Mirvish \u2013 has out-Ali G'd Ali G. The New Republic apologised for falling for the hoax. MSNBC apologised for running a false story. But why was it so easy for Washington to believe that Martin Eisenstadt was a bonafide John McCain campaign adviser? Especially when the reporter community has had its share of hucksters and tricksters in the past, real ones who've gotten the newspaper and magazine industry into real trouble? For one the faux-pundit (faux-dit?) had all the right markers. He had an institute behind him \u2013 the Harding Institute (did anyone bother to check the name? Harding was one of America's least popular presidents. And while it's possible one would exist, wouldn't more of us know about it?); a plausible-sounding name (the Einsenstadt group, like the Albright Group among others. And yet the tricks were already out there \u2013 back in July Jonathan Stein, blogging for Mother Jones, retracted a blog post claiming that Einsenstadt had boasted of building a casino in Baghdad's green zone (a bluster that had international implications as Iraqi bloggers complained). But in this rapacious environment, where 24-hour news channels and bloggers soak up every nugget of election-related recriminations, perhaps no one really wanted the story to be wrong. It was so juicy \u2013 Sarah Palin, so unvetted, she didn't even know the world was round! So MSNBC, Fox and others didn't notice earlier retractions that used Eisenstadt as a source. And perhaps the McCain campaign is so annoyed at Sarah Palin and her transparent, sloppy eagerness to keep herself on the world stage, that they just let her twist in the wind with this one. But would a truly conservative pundit \u2013 who'd been linked to and used as a source for months now by such reputable sources that have sheepishly recalled their stories, really comment in this way regarding Sarah Palin's debate prep for meeting Joe Biden? The real thing we had to constantly remind her was to never, ever compare herself in any way to Hillary Clinton, as she had at her announcement speech. We had it on good authority that Biden was prepping to unleash the inevitable line, 'I know Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton is a friend of mine. And Sarah, you're no Hillary Clinton.' Alas, Biden would have been right."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
