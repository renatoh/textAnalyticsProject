After last season's four-day Ebor meeting was washed out, drastic action was required. This week, after the completion of drainage work at a cost of \u00a32.5m, racing returns to York with the eagerly awaited Dante meeting. Ground conditions should be perfect for the three-day fixture, which kicks off on Wednesday, according to former champion jockey Kevin Darley. Now chief executive of the Professional Jockeys Association, Darley recently rode round the track on horses from the Richard Fahey yard. \"The course is in excellent condition. I would say it was the best I've ever ridden on there,\" said Darley yesterday. \"Things have been difficult for William Derby [the clerk of the course] as in the past you could water, then get a bit of rain which would quickly turn things boggy.\" With going forecast as good, good to firm in places, York's new drainage will not be put to the test this week and it will be a level playing field for one of the most significant Derby trials, Thursday's Dante Stakes. Brian Meehan, the trainer of Crowded House, will welcome fast conditions for his colt, who has been installed the 6-4 favourite. A top race in its own right, the Dante has become a key contest with regards to Epsom, three of the last five Derby winners, North Light, Motivator and Authorized, having won here. Motivator and Authorized had also won the Racing Post Trophy as two-year-olds, and Crowded House (2.40) was very impressive when taking the Doncaster race last year. The turn of foot he showed to beat Jukebox Jury by 3\u00bd lengths, in a decidedly smart time, marked Meehan's colt as a serious prospect. On breeding he will be suited by starting his three-year-old campaign over the 10 furlongs of the Dante. Kite Wood, an expensive acquisition from the Michael Jarvis stable, will need to produce something special to kick-start a moderate season for Godolphin. Kite Wood looked useful when beating Taameer and Four Winds at Ascot last autumn, but neither of those colts has advertised that form since. Aidan O'Brien has five entries in the Dante and, as is his way, will probably have more than one runner. Ladbrokes' betting, usually a good guide in these matters, suggests Freemantle is Ballydoyle's best. The 5-1 second favourite, this son of Galileo won his maiden by 10 lengths at Tipperary. It will be interesting to see which colt O'Brien runs from four possibles in the six-furlongs race for two-year-olds on Thursday. They include Steinbeck, about whom O'Brien told the Racing Post last month: \"The birds in the trees around here are singing about him.\" O'Brien's Fame And Glory will consolidate his position as a leading Derby contender if he can win this afternoon's Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial at Leopardstown. Winner of the Ballysax Stakes here last month, he is following the path taken by the stable's previous Derby winners, Galileo and High Chaparral. Fame And Glory has a 3lb penalty, as opposed to the 5lb extra he defied in the Ballysax. Even so, third-placed Mourayan (3.55) may well turn the tables today. John Oxx's colt finished strongly after getting hampered as a pacemaker dropped back. Oxx, successful in the Leopardstown race with his 2000 Derby winner Sinndar, said yesterday: \"Mourayan got caught in on the rail in the Ballysax and had to let everything get past. The race was over by the time he got out, but he flew home and he should have been in a photo with the winner at the least.\" At Uttoxeter, For A Dancer (4.00) can get off the mark over hurdles. A lot of water has passed under the bridge since he fetched 200,000gns as a yearling, but he has shown enough in three runs for Sue Smith to suggest he is well handicapped here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
