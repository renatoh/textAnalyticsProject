Smith takes his team across the city tomorrow for what is widely regarded as the most pivotal game of the Scottish season to date. They trail Celtic by two points at the top of the Premier League; on 27 December, after a victory for Gordon Strachan's men at Ibrox, that gap stood at seven. \"People make you favourites for the league championship if you win the first Old Firm game of a season; there are farcical assumptions made after these matches,\" said Smith, who highlighted poor results against sides other than Celtic as a more legitimate point of reference. \"These games themselves are always tight. We have a situation this season where Rangers have won at Celtic Park and Celtic have won at Ibrox, the league is still tight and what people have tended to forget is that we have dropped points to other teams. \"From my own point of view, that highlights an inconsistency in our game. The [Old Firm] game is important, it is always important, but not more important than a situation where we drop points to other teams. We need consistency, as last season where we won 13 games in a row at one stage. There is still a bit to be adjusted to other than this game.\" Smith remains evidently rattled by suggestions he adopts an overly cautious approach for matches such as these. It is far from certain, for example, that the prolific Kris Boyd will start the match; he may be sacrificed in order that the manager can deploy a holding midfielder. \"People can make their own assumptions and make their own assessment if they want,\" Smith said. \"In the years I have been here, I don't think we have ever been far off the top scorers in the league. And on a couple of occasions, we have scored more than 100 goals.\" If Rangers are to reinforce their midfield, Lee McCulloch is the most likely player to perform an anchorman role. The former Wigan Athletic player believes his team will kick-off tomorrow as underdogs but has pinpointed mental toughness as the reason for clawing back five of that seven-point Celtic advantage. \"We are starting to get a mental strength we have not had for a while,\" McCulloch insisted. \"Celtic have it because they have been champions three times on the bounce but we are starting to get that. That mental strength maybe deserted us a wee bit at the end of last season but it is important to make the most of this opportunity. Celtic will be favourites as the home team but we have clawed the deficit back to two points and have to keep pushing. \"This game is as much about psychological strength as physical strength.\" Despite McCulloch's assertions to the contrary, Celtic apparently have had their problems in the build-up to this game. A training ground altercation between Aiden McGeady and Artur Boruc nine days ago created significant headlines, while Shaun Maloney has suffered a recurrence of a hamstring injury and faces several weeks on the sidelines. The champions, who struggled past Queen's Park in the Cup last weekend, had not scored a goal in their previous 210 minutes of football. \"Overall our form has been good enough to keep us two points clear at the top of the league and in two cups,\" said Strachan. \"But it hasn't been great recently and we are not kidding ourselves about that. We aren't blaming anyone else, pitches, referees, travelling; we have had chances to win games and have not so the lead has slipped.\" Further wastefulness should lead to Rangers seizing timely initiative, whether their manager chooses to admit it or not."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
