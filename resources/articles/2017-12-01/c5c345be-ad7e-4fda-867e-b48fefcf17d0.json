Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s team are six points better off, at the 17-game mark, than the treble-winning side of 1998-99 that will always be held up as Ferguson\u2019s greatest work. The current side have outscored Arsenal\u2019s Invincibles from the corresponding stage of the 2003-04 season and achieved the unique feat of being widely derided for anaemic football while, in reality, scoring more goals than the 1995-96 Newcastle side that was managed by Kevin Keegan and had the nickname of \u201cthe Entertainers\u201d. Mourinho\u2019s players have 38 points from 17 games and, to put that into perspective, it is more than Ferguson\u2019s teams had managed at the same stage in 16 out of 27 trophy-laden years. It is also more than Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s sides managed in two of his three championship seasons and, in any other year, it would do just fine for a team that likes to think it has authentic title ambitions. Liverpool have won the league 18 times but there were only two of those occasions, in 1978-79 and 1987-88, when they had a better record at this stage of a season. Unfortunately for Mourinho, these are the details that can be overlooked when United are cut adrift in second place and England\u2019s top division has never been in this position so early, with advent calendars barely half\u2011opened and Fairytale of New York on the radio, when the destination of the league title already feels like a foregone conclusion. Mourinho has put together a team that, in ordinary circumstances, would have an outstanding chance. The problem, of course, is that these are not ordinary circumstances, when the team the other side of Mancunian Way have been having so much fun the bookmakers have already started paying out, six months early. That does not make it impossible for Mourinho, the serial trophy machine, to conjure up a different narrative to take the emphasis away from Manchester City. His trophy haul last season shows he has assembled a formidable cup team. They are competing in three knockout competitions and Mourinho may still fancy the idea of emulating what happened 50 seasons ago \u2013 when City won the First Division title and two weeks later Matt Busby\u2019s team trumped them with the European Cup. The people who have been dancing on the Portuguese\u2019s grave this past week should certainly make sure the coffin is properly nailed down first and Louis van Gaal, in particular, has some nerve criticising his successor when his own time in Manchester was so bland and grey. United, according to Van Gaal, are now playing \u201cfar more boring football\u201d and he has questioned why Mourinho is not, in his view, subjected to the same level of criticism. \u201cI always played attacking football. The proof is that the opposition were always parking the bus. They don\u2019t do that now because Mourinho plays so defensively.\u201d Is he being serious? There was a point in the Van Gaal era, no matter how much he might want us to airbrush it from history, when United had taken fewer shots than every other Premier League club bar the Sunderland side that spent 237 days in the relegation places. United made more backward passes than any other club. They had the lowest percentage when it came to moving the ball forward and, frankly, the players hated it. David de Gea, for one, would not have stuck around if Van Gaal were still in charge. Other players talk of the mood inside the dressing room then as bordering on mutiny. Mourinho, contrary to the Dutchman\u2019s claims, has also been under intense scrutiny after the sporadic occasions, such as the game at Liverpool earlier this season, when a team once famous around the world for attacking football have not just parked the bus but jammed the handbrake and chucked the keys down the nearest drain. Equally, it is a nonsense to say the current United side are less watchable, as a rule, than the one Mourinho inherited and anyone suggesting otherwise should perhaps note the fact Van Gaal\u2019s final season saw the team score 49 league goals, when their previous average in the Premier League era was 76.4. There is no doubt United\u2019s supporters, the people who once produced a banner reading: \u201cNot Arrogant, Just Better,\u201d have known happier times and that the \u201cPark the bus\u201d chants from City\u2019s supporters last Sunday will have cut to the bone. But don\u2019t fall for the oft\u2011repeated line that watching United, under Mourinho, is a permanent bore\u2011fest. It is bordering on absurd when the team have already scored four goals on eight separate occasions this season and are outscoring Keegan\u2019s Newcastle from the year the league title seemed destined for the north-east. At the same time, any defence of Mourinho would have to accept that his behaviour has been wearing thin for some time now and, knowing the nature of the beast, that it is likely to get even more tiring as long as United are consigned to a game of catch-up and there is hard evidence he has lost his personal battle with Pep Guardiola. No doubt it is all linked to the reasons why we see so little of the old Mourinho these days and the man who returned to England for his second spell at Chelsea calling himself \u201cthe Happy One\u201d. Where has that Mourinho gone these last few years? There was once a time, particularly in his first spell at Stamford Bridge, when a press conference with the Portuguese was one of the week\u2019s highlights and, at his very best, he often gave the impression he could charm the birds down from the eaves. These days, he seems so embittered, so joyless, brooding over everything, storing up his make-believe grievances, staring back through suspicious eyes. It was there again before the Manchester derby with his sour and apparently premeditated remarks about Guardiola having the temerity to wear a yellow ribbon in support of Jordi S\u00e0nchez and Jordi Cuixart for their jailing, under suspicion of sedition, as key members of the Catalan independence movement. Mourinho just made himself look small-minded and solipsistic with those comments, and hypocritical, in the extreme, with his follow-up remarks about City\u2019s tactical fouling and alleged diving. He might actually have the semblance of a point but he is taking us for fools if he expects us to forget he is the guy, if this were a game of snooker, who would be standing behind the pocket, chalking his cue and coughing every time his opponent had a shot. As for what happened after that game, Mourinho\u2019s proclamations that the blame should be heaped exclusively on the players of Manchester City is just the latest occasion when he has brought to mind an old quote from Val\u00e9ry Giscard d\u2019Estaing, the former president of France. \u201cJacques Chirac,\u201d he said, \u201ccould have his mouth full of jam, his lips can be dripping with the stuff, his fingers covered with it, the pot can be standing open in front of him. And when you ask him if he\u2019s a jam\u2011eater, he\u2019ll say: \u2018Me eat jam? Never.\u2019\u201d Ultimately, though, the point remains that Mourinho, no matter how sticky his fingers, would be getting a lot more slack were it not for the fact that Guardiola has put together such a beautiful body of work just a couple of miles away. Mourinho has been here before with Guardiola\u2019s Barcelona but this time it may be an even bigger challenge. United, unlike Real Madrid, do not have Cristiano Ronaldo to help restore some balance. Sisu elephant still in room at Coventry The latest update from Newcastle United about Mike Ashley\u2019s proposed sale of the club sounds like encouraging news for all of us who have wondered over the years how long it might be before a sense of normality breaks out at one of our great old clubs. Yet Newcastle are not the only club who could desperately do with a change and let\u2019s not forget poor old Coventry City down in League Two and the continuing damage inflicted by the Sisu regime dragging them through a hedge fund backwards. The last week has seen Sisu chalk up its 10th anniversary at the club but nobody in Coventry was celebrating the milestone. Just as a small example of the expertise brought to the club, these were the bright sparks, remember, who wanted to bring in a \u201ctext-a\u2011substitute\u201d option for supporters to make the manager\u2019s decisions during matches. Coventry were a fine club when I was growing up and a fixture in England\u2019s top division. The last decade has been spent rubbernecking in their direction and can probably be epitomised by the time one of Sisu\u2019s representatives, Onye Igwe, interrupted a board meeting when they were supposed to be discussing the club\u2019s perilous finances to complain that Sky Blue Sam, the mascot, was too fat and not setting a good example to children. \u201cOnye, it\u2019s a fucking elephant\u201d \u2013 the response of the former chairman, Ray Ranson \u2013 would be a fine title for any book of the Sisu years. The more important detail is that Sisu\u2019s watch includes the indignity of Coventry making a 68-mile round trip to Sixfields, Northampton Town\u2019s ground, to play \u201chome\u201d matches for just over a season and the relegations that mean \u201cPlay up, Sky Blues\u201d is now heard in the fourth tier of English football. It has been, put bluntly, a shambles and the most jarring part is that, unlike Newcastle, the people at the top do not seem to be that concerned about finding a way out. Until that changes, you have wonder what the next 10 years might bring for a once\u2011proud club. Clough\u2019s novel way to adjust volume Amid all the talk about Manchester City\u2019s players liking their music at full blast I am reminded of the times when Wimbledon, back in the days of the Crazy Gang, also used to take a few liberties the same way. Vinnie, Dennis, \u201cFash\u201d and all the others always liked to make their presence felt \u2013 their way of announcing they did not care who they upset \u2013 and tried it on at Nottingham Forest one year when, suffice to say, the playlist was a lot different to Brian Clough\u2019s usual choice in his office along the corridor of Frank Sinatra. With the corridors of the City Ground vibrating, Clough sent his assistant, Alan Hill, to knock on the door of the away dressing room and ask them to turn the music down. Vinnie Jones opened the door wearing nothing but his underpants and nodded at the request. But very soon the music was back at full volume. Hill was sent back a second time, Jones apologised again and exactly the same happened a few minutes later. At which point Cloughie marched into Wimbledon\u2019s dressing room, lifted their ghetto blaster above his head and dropped it on the tiled floor. \u201cNow play your music,\u201d he said, before marching back out. None of the Wimbledon players uttered a word, apparently."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
