Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s side led the table by a point on 1 January and by two on 3 February yet by 25 March Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s side had slipped to six points from the top, a gap they never recovered, finishing fourth. City trail Chelsea by only three points, with the deficit having been as much as eight. The manager was asked if the champions will have to be better than last year to defend the title. \u201cI think Arsenal had a very similar number of points last season as Chelsea have now at this moment,\u201d he said of their 39 points. \u201cSo we\u2019ll see what happens in the second half and how many points you need to win.\u201d Pellegrini disputed the notion that Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s side possess more staying power now than Wenger\u2019s team did. \u201cWe don\u2019t know. Maybe Arsenal last season couldn\u2019t do it in the second half but we don\u2019t know what Chelsea will do this year. I think that we must try and think about our team and not the others,\u201d he said. Pellegrini has all of his three frontline strikers absent for Saturday\u2019s visit of Crystal Palace. Sergio Ag\u00fcero has a knee injury, Edin Dzeko a calf complaint and Stevan Jovetic a hamstring problem. Yet the Chilean denied this gives him a crisis in his goalscoring department. \u201cIt is not a crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we are very unlucky to have the three strikers at the same moments with different injuries. It is not a thing you think can happen before the season. The same thing happened with Newcastle, with three goalkeepers. It is very unlucky and you must try and find a solution in a different way.\u201d Asked about when the strikers would return, Pellegrini said: \u201cWe will see. Maybe Stevan Jovetic can be fit next week. The other two I don\u2019t think will be able to play this year. \u201cIt is not a normal situation. Maybe in this season we have a lot of things so we don\u2019t have the four strikers we had last year. Maybe we would be unlucky and the fourth striker would be injured also. It\u2019s not a thing that I want to talk more about. We have to have the solution and not try to complain.\u201d Pellegrini may decide to start the 18-year-old Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Pozo for a second consecutive game. The Spanish forward has made only three Premier League appearances. But would the manager ever consider a false No9 approach? \u201cIt is a system you can play,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe it is not one I prefer to play but more than a system this team always have a lot of different players who are scoring, our full-backs, our midfielders. So it is important to have a massive arrival to the other box, so we have different options, with shooting and different things.\u201d Vincent Kompany is also not available to face Palace. \u201cVincent is recovering from both of his injuries, his hamstring and his calf. He is improving but he is not fit,\u201d said the manager."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
