This year, it arrived with some ironically glorious weather: perfect for guns alive to the beauties of the purple-clad heather moorland. I write \u201cironically\u201d because the cold and wet during the spring, when the grouse were breeding, means that there are precious few birds to be shot. Some moors have cancelled altogether, at severe financial loss to their owners. But grouse are like that: the population booms for a few years, then collapses. When conditions are right, this completely wild bird, which bursts suddenly over the guns, with a fast, jinking flight, is regarded as one of the supreme sporting challenges, hence the thousands of pounds aficionados around the world will pay to have a pop at it. For the moor owner and his staff, a whole year\u2019s work culminates in just a few days of shooting. The success of these days will determine whether the gamekeepers have jobs next year. They are under intense pressure to present a large number of grouse to the guns and while most estates are scrupulous in observing the law that protects the birds of prey that eat young chicks, one or two rogue keepers break the law. That\u2019s what conservation charities think, anyway, when protected birds such as sea eagles disappear and they may be right; it\u2019s hard to be certain, because of the difficulty of finding corpses over a vast terrain and difficult to prosecute. [See footnote.] These cases perpetuate the antipathy between moor owners and the public at large, dating at least to the mass trespass on the Duke of Devonshire\u2019s moor at Kinder Scout in 1932. Obviously, the destruction of protected raptors is deplorable. And yet it illustrates an interesting point about the countryside. Because the magnificent sea eagle, otherwise the white-tailed eagle, Britain\u2019s largest bird of prey, hasn\u2019t lived in Scotland continuously; its numbers plummeted across Europe in the 19th century and died out in Scotland altogether. The sea eagles we now have were reintroduced in a programme that started in 1975. While many people would be thrilled to see one in the skies, they were a source of controversy in Suffolk when the idea of re-establishing them was mooted there some years ago. Farmers worried about their lambs. One person\u2019s natural marvel can be a threat to someone else\u2019s livelihood. More controversy will be on its way if rewilding takes hold. On the 23,000-acre Alladale Wilderness Reserve in remote Sutherland, Paul Lister dreams of reintroducing wolves, as well as bear, lynx, wildcat and wild boar. Wolves would provide a natural solution to the deer problem; an overpopulation of red deer has nibbled much of the Highlands into a biodiversity desert. Any seedling that succeeds in pushing a leaf above ground in what used to be the Caledonian forest is immediately eaten. A wolf pack would give the deer a run for their money, but ramblers, determined to make the most of Scotland\u2019s right to roam, fear that they\u2019d have to put on a turn of speed too. And few farmers are likely to welcome the return of a predator that was driven to extinction in the 18th century, precisely because of the toll it took of young animals. Perhaps, post Brexit, the CAP budget will be reprioritised, meaning that agriculture becomes more intensive in parts, using a panoply of new techniques, and wilder in others. But that\u2019s a big perhaps. One of the most successful reintroductions has been the red kite, after the first releases in the Chilterns more than 20 years ago. Now a dozen may be in the sky at any time over the M40 in Oxfordshire, since the first releases in 1989. They\u2019re not the fearsome predators that they appear (and which the Victorians thought them): they eat carrion. One tried to snatch a pomeranian dog a couple of years ago but not necessarily to eat; they\u2019re known to like toys, not to mention, as Shakespeare reminds us, scraps of laundry, of the kind worn next to the skin: \u201cWhen a kite builds, look to lesser linen.\u201d Its foraging habits may encourage it to join urban foxes around the bins on city streets, not an attractive prospect to those who have done battle with gulls in coastal towns. Often, the rule of our delicately balanced countryside is that success for one species spells disaster for another. Grey squirrels, able to digest unripe nuts, out-eat their red cousins. Water vole numbers have collapsed since the escape or release of mink from fur farms. Throw a lump of bait into the upper waters of the Thames and you\u2019ll pull up a fistful of crayfish, but they\u2019ll be signal crayfish from North America; those brawny Yanks have reduced our white-tailed natives to endangered status. Hundreds of hedgehogs, descendants of those introduced in the 1970s to reduce garden slugs, have been removed from South Uist, where they were eating the eggs of wading birds. They were trapped and relocated. A more rugged approach has been adopted in New Zealand where the government hopes to eradicate all the country\u2019s rats, ferrets, stoats and feral cats and dogs in coming decades. Evolution didn\u2019t equip flightless birds such as the kiwi to survive them. Let\u2019s not get into badgers and the controversy over bovine TB. It\u2019s worth remembering, though, what they\u2019d do with those hedgehogs, lovingly transported form South Uist. Their strong claws can unroll a curled-up hedgehog, which then screams as its insides are torn out. Badgers aren\u2019t solely responsible for the hedgehog\u2019s precipitous decline but some blame lies with the well-meaning Badger Protection Act. For the countryside isn\u2019t a wilderness \u2013 humankind keeps the balance. Many wildflowers, for instance, only survive in combination with farming practices, whether the grazing of chalk downland or the turning of soil by the plough. Which brings us back to grouse moors. I visited one in Yorkshire and it was teeming with lapwings, plovers and curlews, as well as young grouse. Grouse moors don\u2019t have many foxes or stoats \u2013 the keepers see to that. Which produces ideal conditions for many species, along with the one that makes the income to pay for it: grouse. Whatever you think of shooting, that\u2019s worth bearing in mind. Clive Aslet is a former editor of Country Life \u2022 Readers\u2019 editor\u2019s footnote: The number of rogue gamekeepers is a matter of controversy. Successful prosecutions of gamekeepers or, vicariously, of their employers, over deaths of birds of prey are rare. Law-breaking resulting in deaths of birds of prey is less so. And bird of prey fatalities, whether or not resulting from proven law-breaking, are considerably less rare. Data differs, and is not always readily comparable. \u2022 Comments will be opened later today"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
