Here, Radio 1 world DJ Gilles Peterson picks a spectacular path through the catalogue of the UK's leading Brazilian label, jumping from languid bossa nova (Sidney Miller) to funky jazz (the Ipanemas) and chill-out sunrise mixes (Joe Carretas). The emphasis is on cool sophistication, Rio-style, typified by the samba siren Clara Moreno, but there are thunderous carnival drums and bleeping whistles, plus oddities like the avant-garde rock of Binario, and Jose Mauro's \"Obnoxious\", where crooning vocals, big band jazz and 60s pop melodies meld madly. A seamless, exultant celebration."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
