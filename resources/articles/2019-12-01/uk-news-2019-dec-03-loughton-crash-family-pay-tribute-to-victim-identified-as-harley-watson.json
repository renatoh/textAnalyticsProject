He was formally identified on Tuesday as Harley Watson, a pupil at Debden Park high school, moments after Essex police revealed it had referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) over previous contact between its officers and an arrested suspect in the case. \u201cWe are so devastated by what has happened,\u201d Harley\u2019s family said on Tuesday evening. \u201cHarley was a good, kind, helpful and lovely boy. We would like to thank everyone for their kind wishes and concern. However as a family we would like people to respect our privacy and allow us to grieve in peace.\u201d Earlier, it emerged that detectives were looking into suggestions the suspect may have tried to carry out a similar attack at another school moments earlier. Officers confirmed they had received reports of a car mounting the pavement outside Roding Valley high school in Loughton about 10 minutes before Harley was killed on Monday. They said the first incident was reported to officers \u201cafter it became widely known we were dealing with a serious collision\u201d outside Debden Park high school. \u201cOur investigations have led us to establish that there may be connections between that incident and the one which has led us to establish a murder investigation,\u201d Essex police said. Four other teenagers and a woman in her 20s received non-life-threatening injuries in the second incident. Tributes were left at the scene on Tuesday, with dozens of bouquets and handwritten cards addressed to Harley, the \u201cfunniest\u201d boy, adorning the school wall. \u201cForever in our heart. Fly high,\u201d read one. \u201cYou will be missed, it won\u2019t be the same without you,\u201d another said. Eli Claarson, 12, and his mother, Simone, came to lay flowers and pay their respects. \u201cI went to primary school with Harley,\u201d Eli said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen each other since year 6 but we still chatted online. It\u2019s so sad to know he\u2019s gone. He was so caring and would never have done anything to anyone.\u201d Simone added: \u201cAs a parent, it really makes me concerned about the kids. I worry for them getting home after school.\u201d Christian Cavanagh, the executive headteacher of Debden Park high, said Watson \u201chad made his mark on the school\u201d and was \u201cliked and loved by staff and students\u201d. Sandra Lyfield, 68, who lives close to the school, said: \u201cIt\u2019s shocking when something like that happens around here. Even if you don\u2019t know the people, it\u2019s just horrible. It chokes you up. I walk my dog down there, and today it\u2019s so sombre, with people crying.\u201d James English, a 34-year-old resident said: \u201cEveryone\u2019s just really sad. The kids normally play and ride their bikes down here, doing wheelies on the street. Now everyone\u2019s just really sad.\u201d Another resident, who did not wish to give her name, added: \u201cIt could be anybody\u2019s child, it\u2019s just horrific.\u201d Many people wept as they arrived to lay tributes at the school throughout the morning. There was an extensive cordon in place at the scene of the crash, with much of the road closed to the public and a heavy police presence nearby. The school remained open, and was offering counselling to those affected by the event, while police photographers and investigation teams worked to gather evidence on the street. A 51-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder, six offences of attempted murder and one offence of causing death by dangerous driving. He was also arrested on suspicion of six offences of causing serious injury by driving, failing to stop at the scene of a collision and of driving without insurance, police said. Officers said the suspect was found in a vehicle in the car park of a pub about three miles from the scene of the murder at 11pm on Monday. \u201cWe have recovered a car and we do have a scene on there currently as part of our ongoing investigations. I am keen to establish the journey the car took from [the school] to the car park of the Merry Fiddler pub,\u201d said the senior investigating officer, DCI Rob Kirby. Confirming its voluntary self-referral to the IOPC on Tuesday evening, Essex police said it had become \u201caware of speculation around specific elements of contact between the force and the suspect\u201d but declined to confirm any further details."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
