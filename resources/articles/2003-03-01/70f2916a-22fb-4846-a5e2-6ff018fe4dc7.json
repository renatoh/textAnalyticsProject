The new text would set the Iraqi president, Saddam Hussein, a series of disarmament tests he must pass to avoid war but France and Russia have threatened to veto any resolution authorising military action. They argue that evidence of accelerated disarmament by Iraq is a reason for continuing inspections. A vote on the proposed resolution is not expected until Thursday at the earliest, pushing back a March 17 ultimatum suggested by London last week for Iraq to disarm. But the White House spokesman, Ari Fleischer, today said the vote will take place this week and rejected a proposal to extend the deadline for Baghdad to disarm by one month. He said the plan for President Saddam to get rid of his alleged weapons of mass destruction by April 17 or face war was \"a non-starter\". The US-led coalition needs nine votes from the security council's 15 members to pass the resolution: it can, at present, count on the US, Britain, Bulgaria and Spain, and is attempting to canvass the support of Chile, Mexico, Angola, Cameroon and Guinea. But Germany, Syria and China are preparing \"no\" votes or abstentions, and Pakistan, previously one of the six waverers, is to announce it will not support war with Iraq. Its prime minister, Zafarullah Khan Jamali, is expected to make a televised address saying Pakistan will not vote for war, indicating that it will abstain if a proposed second resolution authorising military action is put to the security council. Mr Jamali's military-backed civilian government fears support for war with Iraq would play into the hands of Islamist parties who made big gains in elections last October by exploiting anti-US sentiment. With the deadline failing to pick up support, Iraq today destroyed more of its Samoud 2 missiles - giving further backing to security council members who argue disarmament is working. Iraq's information ministry said UN inspectors went to the Taji military compound, where the missiles are being crushed with bulldozers, but did not give further details. Since March 1, Iraq has crushed about half of its 100-strong arsenal of the short-range missiles. Mohamed El Baradei, the head of the UN's nuclear watchdog, today said he hoped war could be avoided but it was up to Baghdad to prove it had no banned weapons. \"Iraq has to provide to the international community what it needs to show that Iraq doesn't have weapons of mass destruction,\" he said. Mr Baradei yesterday told the Saudi-owned newspaper al-Hayat that the \"ball is still in the Iraqi court\". \"If Iraq, during the coming week or the next two weeks, failed to present absolute evidence that it does not possess [banned] weapons, we will walk the path of war,\" he said. US officials today claimed that an Iraqi threat to two of its U-2 surveillance planes operating under the UN's disarmament regime was further evidence that Baghdad was not cooperating with inspectors. The planes, which fly with Iraqi approval to determine whether the country has secret stashes of chemical and biological weapons, were forced to return to base after Iraq \"raised a fuss,\" a US official said. The US military meanwhile said coalition aircraft enforcing the southern no-fly zone bombed three unmanned military communication sites. The zones were originally meant to protect the northern Kurds and the marsh Arabs and Sh'ia populations of southern Iraq but have been used to weaken Iraqi defences in recent weeks. Iraq was today however defiant and the government-run al-Jumhuriya newspaper predicted that a US-led invasion would fail. \"The tyrants of the evil American administration will meet their black fate at the high gates of Baghdad, where the courageous people of Iraq will teach them a lesson,\" it said in an editorial. In the capital, more sandbag-reinforced foxholes today cropped up on the streets and residents dug wells and trenches in their yards. Prices for basic goods like powdered milk, sugar and cooking oil also rose sharply as Iraqis stocked up on basic supplies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
