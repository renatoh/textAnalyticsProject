Naturally, I am particularly interested in what the sports columnists have to say - Jimmy Greaves, for one, never holds back on England football issues. Magazines I tend to get football magazines such as Four Four Two and, as I'm really into cricket at the moment, I'll also get the Wisden Cricket Monthly. I know that makes me sound one-dimensional, but football and cricket are my hobbies and my job. Books The last novel I read was Khaled Hosseini's The Kite Runner, which was terrific. Prior to that, I read Pele's autobiography because I had to interview him for Football Focus. TV Apart from the compulsory sports viewing I'll watch absolutely any football match. I am seriously into 24. In fact, my wife and I are such huge fans that we took a boxset on our honeymoon. I like Question Time, too; David Dimbleby is great at relating to both the audience and the panellists, and has incredible grace under pressure. Radio I think Nicky Campbell on 5 Live is great. I used to be a big fan, too, of Nick Abbot, a prankster-cum-host of open-air forums who had a late-night show on Virgin about 10 years ago. Ads Oh my god, there is one for a car that goes, \"What? Why? Who? When?\". And it goes on like that for two minutes. It drives me barmy. But worse than that is this ad on the radio for the company that supplies Waitrose. It spells out every letter of their name, and as soon as I hear the first syllable, that's it, the radio goes off. New media I love newsnow.co.uk, which sources every available story on the web appropriate to the words that you type in - in my case \"Leicester\" and \"City\" - and refreshes itself every few minutes. \u00b7 Manish Bhasin presents the Cricket World Cup on BBC1"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
