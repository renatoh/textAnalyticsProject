Witnessing, and detesting, the growing divide between rich and poor through the stagnation and fall in the real value of wage and benefits for workers, labour unions in the US are calling on Obama to make good on his promise to support the Employee Free Choice Act. Unions laboured big-time for Obama and were key to his victory. They provided not only millions of dollars of campaign money but also activists to mobilise Americans to vote for Obama. Already passed by the House of Representatives but parked in no man's land in the Senate, the Employee Free Choice Act would allow the playing field of employment relations to be levelled considerably. The main point of the act is to allow workers to use a card check system to gain union representation. At the moment, the National Labour Relations Act of 1935 allows workers to vote on whether to have union representation if they get enough support from fellow workers to have an election. If they do, the election takes place through a secret ballot. The overwhelming problem with this system is that the occasion of an election through secret ballot on a specific date and taking place on company premises allows the employers huge opportunities \u2013 which they take \u2013 to campaign against the will of workers. They often use threats and intimidation to prevent workers from organising. Every year some 23,000 workers are sacked or disciplined for campaigning for gaining union representation. Workers also face the threat of closure of their workplace if they vote in a union. The result of this employer intimidation is that there are fewer and fewer elections held, and unions win fewer and fewer of these that are held. This is contrary to the expressed intention of President Franklin Roosevelt and the lawmakers who initiated the National Labour Relations Act. By preventing workers from gaining union representation, employers are able to keep down the value of wages and conditions. That means more of the profits of the companies go to the employers and shareholders. If the method of deciding whether workers want union representation were determined by an independent verification of how many held current valid union cards (say by the National Labour Relations Board), this would close down many opportunities for employer intimidation. So this is not a case of labour unions calling upon Obama to do their work for him. Rather, this is a case of unions calling on Obama to provide them with the basic floor of fair rights from which they \u2013 the unions \u2013 then have to do the work for themselves. The rub here is that as the new presidency approaches, business is already mounting a huge rearguard action to stop the Employee Free Choice Act being passed onto the statute book. Sensing that it is a time of now or never, of do or die, business is spending millions of dollars trying to convince wavering Democrats and liberal Republicans in the Senate that allowing any other method other than secret ballot to determine union representation is not just anti-democratic but an affront to American democracy. Because democracy is simplistically equated with voting, they have a strong case in making their argument. The mathematics of the political situation is that any piece of legislation \u2013 including the Employee Free Choice Act \u2013 needs the support of at least 60 members in the Senate to be able to pass the threat of a filibuster. If the Democrats fall short of this, the act will never get to the president's desk, even though the House of Representatives has passed it. This is where the testing of Obama's mettle comes into play. He has committed himself to supporting the Employee Free Choice Act because of his politics of instituting fairness into a very unfair society that the US has become. But the crux of the matter is what form his support will take. Will it just be a case of committing to signing the act if and when passed by the Senate? Or, more crucially, is he prepared to use his political authority to campaign to make sure the waverers like Arkansas Democratic senator Blanche Lincoln stop wavering? This is really a question of whether Obama is prepared to stand up to business, who are saying to him in the midst of the worst recession in generations: don't make things any harder for us to make a profit. If Obama goes for some kind of compromise as a way out like supporting the Respect Act instead or the Patriot Employer Act, this will not satisfy the labour unions, although it might assuage the employers. Such a move might represent the first blight on the new Camelot of Obama's \"Change we can believe in\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
