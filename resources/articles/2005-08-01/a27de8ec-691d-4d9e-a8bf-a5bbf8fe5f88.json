The capital - like other major British cities - had been flooded with police on patrol in high-visibility jackets in an understandable attempt to reassure the public and prevent a reoccurence of the two days of terrorist attacks in July. The policy has not been cheap, and police warned it would starve resources for investigating other crimes. But as the Economist notes this week, it has had a welcome side-effect. Instead of rising, which might be expected given the extra challenge facing the police, overall crime levels in London have dropped notably since July 7. There were fewer crimes in inner London last month than in the same period last year and fewer than in May or June this year, which is not normally the case. In the boroughs where the police presence has been heaviest, the fall has been marked. Crime dropped 6% overall in inner London compared with July last year but 12% in the six areas where the attacks took place: Camden, Hammersmith and Fulham, Lambeth, Tower Hamlets, Westminster and the City. Meanwhile, it has risen a little in outer London where patrols have been reduced. The suspicion is that the wise men who repeatedly claim visible patrolling makes no difference to crime levels are wrong, while the damned fools who instinctively welcome the sight of bobbies on the beat are right. The evidence is not conclusive, although the 16% drop in crime in heavily patrolled Tower Hamlets is striking. It suggests that the routine claim of all political parties at election time to put more police on the streets is less shallow than it seems. One Home Office report, Reducing Reoffending, found that patrols \"do not have a marked effect on crime levels\". But the government's introduction of Community Support Officers has been a popular success. In London, Sir Ian Blair agrees: he wants more CSOs to boost patrolling. They are unlikely to catch people in the act - the oft-cited objection to street patrols - but July's evidence suggests they stop at least some criminals carrying out some crimes.
