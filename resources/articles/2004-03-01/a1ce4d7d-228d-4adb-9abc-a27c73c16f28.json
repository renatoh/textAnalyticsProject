The Association of University Teachers, which has been boycotting exam marking in the old universities, yesterday announced it would be recommending members to call off the action, when they meet in Scarborough next week. Negotiators triumphantly announced they had secured an average pay rise of more than 12% over two years \"compared to the currently proposed guaranteed increase of 6.44%\", agreed by the other unions with the Universities and Colleges Employers Association. AUT general secretary Sally Hunt declared: \"It's the view of the AUT's negotiators that the proposals now on the table are the best that have been made to any higher education union in the current pay round, and the best the national employers will agree to\". Vice-chancellors were appalled, and the AUT interpretation of the deal achieved after the intervention of the TUC was strongly denied by Ucea. Meanwhile, the other lecturers' union, Natfhe, which is currently balloting members on the agreement for a new pay framework, is rushing out information to staff in the new universities to try and reassure them that they have not been signed up to a worse deal than AUT members. Unison, which represents librarians and academic related staff in the new universities, has been bombarded with inquiries about the AUT announcement. Christina McAnea, the union's national secretary for education, accused the AUT of \"unrealistic spin\" that could jeopardise the settlement. \"The AUT has to sell this to its members, but there is so much spin that they're in danger of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. There is absolutely no more money on the table\". The complex deal brings all staff in higher education, from cleaners to senior lecturers, onto a single pay-spine; job evaluation will mean additional rises for some staff. Jocelyn Prudence, chief executive of Ucea, today sought to reassure universities that they had not signed up for a 12% pay deal. She told them: \"Please be assured that there is no change to the pay-spine. \"There is no extra additional money on the table resulting from the proposed 'memorandum of understanding' with the AUT announced on March 18. The pay deal remains the same as it always has been; nor does it differ from what has been negotiated with the other unions.\" Ms Prudence added: \"Ucea is examining the AUT's modelling methodology. It would appear that the AUT's figures are based on particular favourable assumptions and interpretations of how 'no detriment' might be achieved.\" But the AUT was unrepentant. \"It is to state the obvious that the new offer leads to significant improvements in pay. The AUT will be seeking to ensure that the important national proposals conceded by Ucea turn into substantial gains for our members - 12.2% is the average progression per-pay-point, based on the only logical implementation of the offer\". Natfhe negotiators have a much less optimistic interpretation of the deal, although they are recommending it to members as the best available. However, they are now concerned that the AUT claim will prompt wavering members to reject the settlement in the hope of doing better. What view the rank and file AUT members take of the offer will become clear when the union's conference opens in Scarborough on Wednesday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
