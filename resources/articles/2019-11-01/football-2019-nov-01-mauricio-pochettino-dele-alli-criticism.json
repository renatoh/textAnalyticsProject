Alli is one of many Tottenham players who have underperformed this season but the 23-year-old was singled out by Sky pundits for criticism after last weekend\u2019s defeat at Liverpool. Spurs are 11th in the Premier League going in Sunday\u2019s game at Everton, and Pochettino has backed the player brought in from Milton Keynes four years ago to help the club climb the table. \u201cWe know very well that Dele is going to be back,\u201d he said. \u201cHis mentality is good. Always you need time to recover the feelings and performance after a tough period. The most difficult thing is to know how long it will take to be again at your best. As long as you are consistent and working hard, you are going to arrive again, though, because the quality is there. The only thing is, the competition do not wait.\u201d Pochettino drew comparison to an earlier period in Alli\u2019s career where the player came under criticism for, among other things, giving the bird to his England teammate Kyle Walker. Talking about the \u201cdevil\u201d in his player, the manager said: \u201cIt\u2019s still there inside of him. If you go back, we all criticised him. But I said I liked this Dele Alli, because sometimes players being a bit naughty makes that difference. The devil is going to appear again. I don\u2019t know when. But for sure it will.\u201d Alli\u2019s mentality came in for criticism this week, with Gary Neville labelling him \u201chalf the player he was\u201d and Graeme Souness suggesting Alli had \u201ctaken his eye off the ball\u201d. Pochettino brushed off criticism from pundits and said he would never become one. \u201cSometimes you get upset when you read or you listen but when you are mature you understand that that is the business: if you go to the TV you need to say something,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
