Wimbush, who was 81, was a familiar voice on BBC radio for more than 60 years, and played three major roles in The Archers over five decades. She appeared in Ambridge first as village schoolteacher Elsie Catcher until the character's retirement in 1967, then as Lady Isabel Lander two years later and returned in 1992 to give a voice to the long-overseas mother of Nigel Pargetter, played by Graham Seed. Vanessa Whitburn, the editor of The Archers, said: \"After a splendid and versatile career, much of it spent in radio drama, I was delighted that Mary agreed to join the cast of The Archers. \" \"Julia Pargetter, the grande dame of Lower Loxley, was every inch Mary's creation and she played her to perfection. Working with Mary was simply a joy. She is a great loss and we will miss her.\" Mark Damazer, the controller of Radio 4, said: \"I was saddened to hear of the death of Mary Wimbush. She took the character of Julia Pargetter with all her flaws and affectations and made her into a believable human being for whom listeners felt a mixture of affection and exasperation. Lower Loxley will be a duller place without her.\" Jenny Abramsky, the director of BBC radio and music, added: \"Mary Wimbush has been part of the fabric of BBC radio drama since her first broadcast in 1945. \"Her contribution has been enormous and news of her death will sadden everybody who appreciates great performances. We send our deepest sympathy to her family.\" Wimbush was awarded a Sony Radio award - the radio equivalent of an Oscar - for best actress in 1991, for her performances in The Horse's Mouth and The Mystery of Edwin Drood. In 1993 she played Lady Edith in The Governor's Consort, a role especially written for her by Peter Tinniswood and some of her Radio 4 productions included Villette, The Poor Clare, The Grey Woman, Easy Virtue and Diary of a Provincial Lady. She also recorded the role of the Duchess of York in Richard III for Riverrun's Arkangel Complete Shakespeare Collection. Along with a variety of theatre roles Mary had many television credits including three series as Aunt Agatha in Jeeves and Wooster. Her most notable film credit was as the Mother in Oh What a Lovely War, directed by Richard Attenborough. She is survived by a son. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
