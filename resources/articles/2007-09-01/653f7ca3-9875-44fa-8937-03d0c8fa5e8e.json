Making light of the second-half dismissal of Philippe Senderos, Arsene Wenger's team produced a fluent attacking display, overwhelming Portsmouth to move alongside Chelsea, Liverpool and Everton at the top of the Premier League table. Two goals to the good by half-time following an Emmanuel Adebayor penalty and a well-taken close-range effort by Cesc Fabregas, Arsenal were reduced to ten men shortly after the break but quickly extended their lead through Tomas Rosicky. A fortuitous goal from the evergreen Kanu briefly threw Portsmouth a lifeline, but Wenger's side were rarely troubled thereafter and saw out the remainder of the game for their fourth successive home win of the season. The build-up to the encounter was dominated by the fallout from David Dein's sale of his 14.58% holding in Arsenal to Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov, with the former vice-chairman insisting that the move was motivated purely by a desire to secure extra investment for the club. Despite Wenger's insistence that self-sufficiency must remain the goal, Dein believes that additional sway in the transfer market is essential if Arsenal are to compete on a level footing with Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool. On this evidence, however, they are in no immediate need of expensive reinforcements. Such is the attacking fluency of Wenger's team that they frequently overran Portsmouth even with ten men. Certainly Arsenal had little need of the help unwittingly afforded them by David James after seven minutes. Much has been made of James' possible recall to England's starting eleven for Saturday's Euro 2008 qualifier against Israel, but when the Portsmouth goalkeeper recklessly brought down Robin van Persie with the Dutchman bearing down on goal, he did little to enhance the case for his inclusion. Referee Mark Halsey rightly had no hesitation in pointing to the spot, and Adebayor calmly stroked the penalty past a rueful James for his first goal of the season. It was a start that Portsmouth - who have yet to register a league win away from home in 2007 - could ill afford, and with Arsenal swarming over the visitors in midfield, further damage was inevitable. Ten minutes from the interval, it duly arrived in the form of the softest of goals, Gilberto Silva flicking on a corner for Fabregas, who spun his marker to prod home his second Premier League goal of the season. Portsmouth were feeling the squeeze, and with Arsenal characteristically imperious in attack, even the dismissal of Senderos four minutes into the second half proved only a temporary inconvenience. Moments after forcing an athletic save from James with a powerful header, the Swiss defender stumbled into the back of Kanu as the Nigerian headed goalwards. A goalscoring opportunity for Portsmouth clearly denied, Halsey had no choice but to reach for his pocket. Portsmouth should have scored from John Utaka's subsequent free-kick, but when the rebound broke to Sean Davis after a scrambling one-handed save by Manuel Almunia in the Arsenal goal, the midfielder could not keep his shot down. And it was not long before Arsenal once again exposed the visitors' soft underbelly, Fabregas taking advantage of a lapse of concentration in the Portsmouth defence to roll a free-kick along the left by-line to Rosicky, who drove home from an acute angle. Kanu somewhat fortunately clawed a goal back for Portsmouth a minute later, Utaka's cross rebounding off his standing leg and into the net for a goal the Nigerian knew little about, but Arsenal were home and dry long before Kolo Toure thwarted a late effort by David Nugent."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
