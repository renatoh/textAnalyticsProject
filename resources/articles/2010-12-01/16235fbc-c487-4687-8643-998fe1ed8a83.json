Though they are hardly identical, they both aspire to make music that is clever and accessible, ensuring that one quality doesn't get in the way of the other. Seeing them in a venue this size is a good sign. Atlanta-based singer Mon\u00e1e has been touring like a Trojan for the last six months, and it shows. She's acquired horn players, a proper light show and even more theatricality. Here is a woman willing, if necessary, to conduct a straight-faced dance battle with backing singers dressed as evil monks. The title of her biggest song, Tightrope, sums up her band's equilibrium between the whipcrack discipline of James Brown and the acid-rock wildness of Funkadelic. She could still learn something from Brown about talking to the audience (ie, she doesn't), but she is ablaze with energy and ideas. Opening with the cheery, ska-tinged Holiday seems like a deliberate attempt by Vampire Weekend to blast some warmth into what frontman Ezra Koenig calls \"this big cold room\". Hostile critics tend to paint these Ivy League-educated New Yorkers' assimilation of African and Caribbean music as an act of colonial rapacity on a par with the seizure of the Koh-i-Noor diamond, but Vampire Weekend aren't faking authenticity. They are sincere enthusiasts, collecting sounds that delight them, and combining them with breezy confidence. While Mon\u00e1e's eccentricity is front and centre, success makes Vampire Weekend seem less peculiar than they really are. It's hard to think of a band who occupied this niche before them. For one thing, they are proudly unrock'n'roll. Koenig, who has a high, delicate singing voice and an arch speaking one, wears a preppy scarf at first, and drummer Chris Tomson sports the kind of knitwear last popular on Noel's Christmas House Party. Their songs take unexpected turns. M79, with its shifting rhythms, baroque keyboard riffs and reference to minor-league baseball player Jackson Crowther, is unlikely fare for a crowd this big. Live favourite Oxford Comma finds thousands singing along to lyrics about social one-upmanship, contentious punctuation, crunk music and the Dalai Lama. All of this works because the tunes are so strong and the execution so crisp and joyous. After playing all of their new album and most of their debut, they end with Walcott, a breakneck anthem about vampires in Massachusetts, amid clouds of confetti and big, bright balloons \u2013 an appropriate mix of the odd and the obvious."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
