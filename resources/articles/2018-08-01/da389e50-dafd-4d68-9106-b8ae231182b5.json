Top stories Aretha Franklin, the \u201cqueen of soul\u201d, has died aged 76. The winner of 18 Grammys and 20 chart-topping singles succumbed to pancreatic cancer, surrounded by family at her home in Detroit. Former US president Barack Obama, at whose inauguration the Memphis-born star performed, was among those who paid tribute to the totemic figure of soul, gospel and R&amp;B. \u201cThrough her compositions and unmatched musicianship, Aretha helped define the American experience,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIn her voice, we could feel our history, all of it and in every shade \u2013 our power and our pain, our darkness and our light, our quest for redemption and our hard-won respect.\u201d Franklin\u2019s career spanned six decades, and she was the first woman inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame. Alexis Petridis recalls the best of Franklin\u2019s music, while Richard Williams looks back on her turbulent life. The Turnbull government faces fresh headaches over its national energy guarantee, with Labor\u2019s climate change spokesman, Mark Butler, warning the Coalition that the opposition would block any new taxpayer support for coal-fired power. \u201cThe idea that taxpayers would take on a risk that investors are not willing to take on I think would be a gross abuse of the political office of prime minister,\u201d Butler said on Guardian Australia\u2019s politics podcast. Former White House aide Omarosa Manigault Newman has released fresh audio recordings, which she says reveal she was offered \u201chush money\u201d by Lara Trump on behalf of Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign. In a phone call with Lara Trump, the president\u2019s daughter-in-law, the former Apprentice contestant was offered a $180,000-a-year job in exchange for being \u201cpositive\u201d about the president \u2013 an offer Manigault Newman claims was \u201can attempt to buy my silence, censor me and pay me off\u201d. Lara Trump has denied she was acting at the president\u2019s behest and called the tapes \u201ca fraud\u201d. Australian psychiatrists have called for greater regulation of video games that encourage the purchase of \u201cloot boxes\u201d, telling a Senate inquiry they could lead to children and young adults developing gambling addictions. The Office of the eSafety Commissioner estimated that 34% of young people made in-game purchases in the 12 months before June 2017. Dr Marcus Carter argued \u201cpredatory\u201d practices were \u201cpervasive\u201d in the industry, and that it was like \u201chaving [a] slot machine in your pocket that actively encourages you to gamble at your most vulnerable moment\u201d. Scientists have solved a 13-year mystery in mapping the wheat genome, a challenge once thought impossible, but considered essential in helping produce hardier wheat varieties if the world is to meet growing food production needs. Scientists have located 107,891 genes and more than 4.7m molecular markers, and hope that traits such as yield, grain quality and resistance to fungal diseases can now be better analysed. \u201cI\u2019d wish I\u2019d be at the beginning of my career again because the fun is really starting now, and we can efficiently decipher the biology of our favourite crop,\u201d said Dr Catherine Feuillet. Sport Football Federation Australia chairman Steven Lowy has sensationally announced he will not seek re-election, potentially ending his family\u2019s more than 50-year association with the game. In an interview with the Australian Lowy cited \u201cthe politics in football\u201d for his decision to leave, which could open the way for an end to the protracted wrangle between FFA and A-League clubs over the game\u2019s governance. Despite the intense physical pressure the game puts on the body, elite netball players are getting older. Over the past decade, the average age of players in Australia\u2019s national league has increased by nearly two years, with 23% of players now aged 30 or over. Players such as Geva Mentor, 33, and Rebecca Bulley, 36, who will contest Sunday\u2019s Super Netball preliminary final are leading the way for the old guard, writes Megan Maurice. Thinking time From feminist anthems to painful songs of heartbreak, strident black politics to spiritual quests, Aretha Franklin became a pop-cultural titan \u2013 and a symbol of American strength, writes Dorian Lynskey. Voted the greatest singer of all time by both Rolling Stone and Mojo, she was \u201cthe reason why women want to sing\u201d, Mary J Blige said. \u201cShe only took hold of a song if she could feel it in her bones and, once she did, it was changed forever. \u201cI just lost my song,\u201d said Otis Redding after hearing her blazing feminist revamp of Respect. \u201cThat girl took it away from me.\u201d In an era of mass disruption of the media and communications industry, how do Indigenous voices find the space and institutional support to tell their stories? \u201cWe make up less than 3% of Australia\u2019s overall population, our cultures and traditions by nature are vastly different to the dominant culture,\u201d writes James Saunders, an IndigenousX journalist who belongs to the Gunditjmara and Wiradjuri nations. \u201cWho gets to decide what the public \u2018needs\u2019 to know? Is that at the discretion of the journalist? The editor? The companies that own the media organisation?\u201d From its grimy tents on Skid Row to its brash plutocracy living in Bel Air, Los Angeles is a city like no other, writes Rory Carroll as he bids farewell to a city of dreamers and squalor. Once described by Dorothy Parker as 72 suburbs in search of a city, LA\u2019s constant complexity \u201coffers the best of America\u201d, Carroll says. \u201cA kaleidoscope of humanity \u2013 more than 200 languages \u2013 jumbled into Chinatown, Koreatown, Little Armenia, Little Ethiopia, Little Tokyo, Boyle Heights, Lincoln Heights, Pasadena, Palisades. Innovation and industriousness. Tolerance and laid-backness. All bathed in golden sunshine.\u201d What\u2019s he done now? Donald Trump has joined in offering tribute to Aretha Franklin, but continued his campaigns against the press, and retaliated against Omarosa Manigault Newman by sharing a video of clips of the former aide praising him. Media roundup \u201cTens of millions of dollars\u201d worth of construction contracts were awarded in exchange for boozy lunches, overseas travel and home renovations, the West Australian reports, as a major investigation by the state\u2019s Corruption and Crime Commission reveals its findings. You can be fined for touching your mobile phone while driving, but you\u2019re allowed to read a book, the Daily Telegraph says, as it rails against loopholes that allow distracted drivers to get off scot free. And the Courier Mail reports that up to a third of science, technology, engineering and maths teachers in Queensland were not trained in those areas, as the state\u2019s teachers\u2019 union warns of a \u201chuge supply issue\u201d and an ageing workforce. Coming up RBA governor Philip Lowe appears before MPs today in Canberra, where he is likely to face questions on house prices, wage growth and interest rates. The Children\u2019s Book Council of Australia will announce the 2018 book of the year in Brisbane.
