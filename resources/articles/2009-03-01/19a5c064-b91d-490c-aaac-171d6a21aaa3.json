The Lloyds chairman played a key role in the rescue takeover of HBOS last year, a deal that MPs were told yesterday had left the combined bank a \"crippled giant\". In voting against Blank, who is due to stand for three-yearly election to the board at the annual meeting in May, or deliberately abstaining, shareholders would be demonstrating their fury about the HBOS takeover. The rescue of HBOS has left Lloyds potentially 77%-owned by the taxpayer after the government underwrote \u00a3260bn of its most troublesome assets. But the major institutions will be pitched against UK Financial Investments (UKFI), the body that looks after the taxpayer's stakes in the banks, which is expected to endorse the chairman. UKFI is in the process of holding a series of meetings with major institutional investors and may be able to gauge the level of shareholder rebellion first hand. The potential row brewing at Lloyds came as the management met City analysts and investors for the first time after heated negotiations with the Treasury, which were concluded in the early hours of Saturday morning. Eric Daniels, the bank's chief executive, who had been determined to avoid the government's stake rising above 43%, insisted that there had been a subtle shift in the need for banks to raise more capital. \"Whereas before the posture was that capital ratios could drift down towards the regulatory minimums as conditions worsened, the thinking now is that capital should be looked at in the face of a reasonably severe stress,\" he said. His comments knocked shares in Barclays, which is expected to begin talks about participating in the asset protection scheme, while Lloyds slumped as low as 36p at one stage before recovering to close at 43.7p. HSBC, in the throes of a \u00a312.5bn rights issue, also slipped dramatically but remained above the 254p at which it is hoping to convince its shareholders to support its cash call. Major Lloyds investors are known to be considering whether to take direct action against the directors. \"There could be votes against the management at the AGM,\" one source said. Of the \u00a3260bn of insurance bought from the government, some \u00a374bn is for mortgages sold by Halifax, the lending arm of HBOS. This was raised in the Commons yesterday by the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Philip Hammond, who said Gordon Brown had repeatedly insisted the banking crisis had been \"made in America\". Hammond said the asset protection deal represented a \"bet\" by ministers on UK house prices falling by less than 10%. Financial secretary, Stephen Timms, said the scheme was necessary to stabilise the banking sector, clean up balance sheets and encourage banks to lend again. Hammond accused the government of creating a \"crippled giant\" by allowing competition rules to be breached to allow Lloyds TSB to takeover HBOS last year. Brown had met Blank at a drinks party last September and gave his tacit support for the deal. Shareholders overwhelmingly voted in favour of the deal last year. A Lloyds spokesman said: \"Our board is completely behind our senior team.\" Liberal Democrat spokesman, Vince Cable, said there was no justification for paying any bonuses at HBOS and raised concerns about pensions for former chief executive, Sir James Crosby, and former director, Peter Cummings, whom he said he had heard was entitled to a \u00a36m payout. Timms said branch staff earned on average \u00a317,000 and would receive bonuses of less than \u00a31,000."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
