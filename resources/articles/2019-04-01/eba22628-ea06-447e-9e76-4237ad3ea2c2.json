Two goals from Lionel Messi and another from Philippe Coutinho condemned United to a 3-0 loss in Barcelona, following their 1-0 reverse at Old Trafford last week, and Solskj\u00e6r acknowledged it could take years before United catch up. \u201cWe\u2019re getting on with the job and we have spoken to the players about how we need to get the best out of each other, create an environment of top-class attitudes, world-class attitudes, every single day,\u201d the United manager said. \u201cWe have good players and we have done really well to get to the quarters and challenge for the top four [in the Premier League]. But we have a rebuilding job. \u201cWe know there\u2019s work to be done. I\u2019ve said all along this isn\u2019t going to change overnight and the next few years are going to be massive to get to the level of Barcelona and other teams.\u201d The scale of that challenge was summed up by Messi\u2019s performance as he delivered a reminder why he has won the Ballon d\u2019Or five times. \u201cHe\u2019s an exceptional talent,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cHe and Cristiano [Ronaldo] have been the best players in the world over the last decade. He showed tonight why we think that and why this team have won so many Champions Leagues. Whenever he gets the ball around the box he will be decisive and unfortunately for us he was the matchwinner.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
