Despite recent hints of differences and unease in the dressing room his threat has come as a complete surprise to club officials and supporters. After the 304-run defeat at the hands of Worcestershire last week, Alleyne said it was \"our worst performance since I've been in charge\". He has led Gloucestershire to five one-day trophies and been a popular leader. But their form and confidence has not been sustained. \"If I find that I no longer have the backing of the players, then I'll stand down,\" Alleyne said. He is known to be upset at the way several experienced members of the team have reacted to being left out. He is also troubled by the club's inconsistency. \"We must show better form or we'll find ourselves in the second division next season,\" he said. Gloucestershire have won only one out of five outings in the second division this season but are still in touch with the teams occupying the top three promotion places. In one-day cricket their form has been better and they are joint top of the Norwich Union second division. Hopes of another return to Lord's, however, are confined to the C&amp;G Trophy after losing to Worcestershire in the quarter-final of the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup. Gloucestershire's chairman and former captain Tony Brown says: \"Mark is a person who doesn't like confrontation. He has a very good record and I must say I was surprised to hear him talking of possibly resigning.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
