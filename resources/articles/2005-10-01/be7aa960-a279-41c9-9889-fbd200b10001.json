The company, which originally said it would hand back \u00a3350m, now plans to return \u00a3600m - partly financed by \u00a3100m raised from selling assets, including the disposal of its Rawlplug business. It also said it would raise the dividend over the next three years from 23p in the current year to 27p next year and 30p in 2007-08. Its move, which the chief executive Richard Cousins hailed as a \"dream answer\" to the bid, put St Gobain on the defensive as the French group saw the City's Takeover Panel freeze the offer timetable because it failed to notify the European commission on time. St Gobain stuck to its offer and criticised the move but some analysts said it could be forced to raise its bid from the current 720p a share to closer to 800p. Others, more cautiously, suggested it might have to pay between 750p and 775p. Mr Cousins said: \"Our objectives were and are to remain independent, not because we have a God-given right, but because we can create excellent shareholder value by growing the business. If St Gobain were to table a bloody big number we have a duty to look at it very seriously.\" BPB, which claims to have the support of its leading shareholders, expects to table its final defence document in mid to late November, setting out further plans to increase profits and sales, launch new products and cut costs. These plans, it says, already offer a premium over the French offer. St Gobain, which has received 0.88% acceptances for its current offer which it has extended until October 30, will know by November 9 whether the EU is to mount a full-scale inquiry into its bid. Under the revised timetable it has until December 3 to raise its offer. The French group, which called for private talks with the BPB board, insisted that what one adviser called \"financial engineering\" would not create shareholder value. BPB, it said \"has decided to mortgage further the future of the company, jeopardising not only future growth prospects but possibly its fundamental stability.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
