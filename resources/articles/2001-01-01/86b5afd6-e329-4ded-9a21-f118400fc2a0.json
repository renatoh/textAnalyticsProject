Quinn, the England Under-21 international on a month's loan, made his Newcastle debut in Saturday's 3-1 victory over Coventry. Bobby Robson hopes to finalise his \u00a31.5m transfer as soon as Domi, absent without leave in Paris since before Christmas, is off-loaded. Leicester's manager Peter Taylor still hopes to solve his goalscoring problems by signing the former Italy striker and Lazio player-coach Roberto Mancini, now a free agent, on a short-term deal. \"The deal is not dead yet,\" said Taylor. \"We may well be having talks with him later this week to see what his position exactly is.\" West Ham will attempt to resurrect Lorenzo Amoruso's transfer when the unsettled Italian defender returns from Rangers' mid-season break in Florida. Amoruso made conciliatory noised yesterday before leaving to play in a series of friendlies. Earlier it appeared the \u00a33m-plus deal had fallen through when talks over personal terms broke down. Christian Vieri has berated Internazionale's fans and says he will no longer celebrate his goals at the San Siro until they get off his back. The Italy striker said after scoring Inter's equaliser against Parma on Sunday: \"It's not fair to barrack a player who has been out for nearly 10 months and is doing everything he can to play again and get back into form.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
