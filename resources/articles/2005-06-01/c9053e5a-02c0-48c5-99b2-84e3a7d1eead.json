Pock! Pardon? Urrrraaaghhh! Pock! Are you OK? Strawberries! Mmmm! Perhaps you shouldn't eat anything for a bit. Come on, Tim! Uh-oh - Rain! Oh, I see. And here come the covers ... You're doing your celebrated impersonation of the All England Club Lawn Tennis Championships, aren't you? Good, isn't it? This year's Wimbledon championships start today. Not bad. Have you got anything to update it for 2005? Look! Isn't that a new 2,600 sq ft retail space by Gate 3? Brilliant. And doesn't the bag searching area at Gate 12 seem somehow bigger? I wouldn't know. Go Andy! Who? I've got Murraymania! I told you not to eat anything. No, Andy Murray: the young British hopeful playing at Wimbledon - the one who dazzled the crowd at Queens. By doing what? Winning? Succumbing to cramp. But with style. So it's gonna be the same as always: the British players crash out, and Federer wins. Federer doesn't always win. He's going to win this year, though, isn't he? Maybe not. He is. He's got an easy draw, and he's better than everyone else. I don't like the look of those clouds to the west; what do you think, Sue? So you've got nothing new to offer. I'm working on an impression of the retractable roof on Centre Court, but it won't be ready until 2009. I can't wait. In the meantime, BBC2 is showing highlights from the 1988 Ladies final. A pony on Federer to win, please, and wake me up when it's over. We're all going on a summer holiday, no more working for a week or two ... Don't make me use my backhand."}, "isHosted": false}}}
