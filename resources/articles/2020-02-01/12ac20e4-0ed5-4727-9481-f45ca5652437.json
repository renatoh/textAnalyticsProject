The nine-page letter written by Michelaine Lahaie, chair of the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission for the RCMP, offers scathing criticism of the police\u2019s continued use of tactics against Indigenous people which she had previously warned against. The document was released as Justin Trudeau\u2019s government struggles to deal with a growing protest movement in support of the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en nation\u2019s fight against a controversial natural gas pipeline in British Columbia. In recent weeks, demonstrations have sprung up across the country, blockading major railway lines and obstructing access to ports and government buildings. On Thursday, Canada\u2019s largest rail operator, CN Rail, obtained a court injunction giving it permission to remove a blockade in St-Lambert, a suburb of Montreal. Quebec\u2019s premier, Fran\u00e7ois Legault, promised swift police-backed action to remove the protest, which since Wednesday has prevented trains from traveling between Montreal and eastern Canada, as well as the US. Separately, Canada\u2019s public safety minister Bill Blair said that the RCMP in British Columbia had agreed to leave the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en territory. But Molly Wickham, the spokeswoman for the Gidimt\u2019en clan in the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en Nation, said that the RCMP had not yet vacated their territory. Speaking to reporters, Wickham said Blair\u2019s comments were part of a \u201cmedia strategy\u201d to defuse the coast-to-coast protest movement along the nation\u2019s rail lines that has led to major economic losses and layoffs. Not all First Nations and clans are opposed to the pipeline. A number of others have signed agreements with the company behind the pipeline, Coastal GasLink, but the pipeline does not have the blessing of the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en hereditary chiefs, and for months activists blocked pipeline workers\u2019 access to the construction site. Earlier this month, the RCMP enforced a court injunction allowing them access, but their tactics have ignited broad criticism, and in January the BC Civil Liberties Association, the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en hereditary chiefs and the Union of BC Indian Chiefs filed a joint complaint to the CCRC. According to the complaint, police created a large exclusion zone which it used to deny access to people including Nation members, media and legal counsel. Other witnesses said the police kept them at a checkpoint for hours in -37C weather while they were trying to deliver food and emergency supplies. The police have conducted raids and arrested activists. Lahaie\u2019s note is not an official report from the CRCC. In fact, the chair said she was not opening an official inquiry, because previous recommendations she made after 2013 Indigenous anti-shale protests in New Brunswick also applied to the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en complaint. That report, completed in 2019, has not yet been made public. However, Lahaie\u2019s correspondence with the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en \u2013 which was released by the complainants \u2013 said that while some elements of the RCMP\u2019s behaviour were reasonable, ID checks, searches and restricting access to the territory were not. Speaking at a press conference in Vancouver, judge Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond, and Harsha Walia from the BC Civil Liberties Association, noted that the RCMP has been aware of Lahaie\u2019s findings for more than a year and still behaved unlawfully in Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en. \u201cThis letter suggests that there\u2019s a very serious problem that the civilian oversight of the RCMP does not work,\u201d said Turpel-Lafond. The Highway of Tears \u2013 a lonesome stretch of highway along which unknown numbers of hitchhiking Indigenous women have gone missing \u2013 passes near Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en territory. Last year, a federal inquiry on the issue heavily criticized the RCMP for its failures to take the issue seriously. Turpel-Lafond said the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en crisis had exposed a fundamental problem at the heart of Canada\u2019s approach to missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls. \u201cCanada\u2019s oversight of policing is clearly inadequate for First Nations. Even the commissioner is essentially saying to us, \u2018I\u2019m impotent to deal with this. Help me to get the RCMP to respond.\u2019 That\u2019s a very sad statement about the state of policing,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
