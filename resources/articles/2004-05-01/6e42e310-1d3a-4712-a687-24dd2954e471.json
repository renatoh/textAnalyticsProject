An emotional Houllier departed Merseyside after a six-year reign which yielded four major trophies though it was his failure to claim a first league title since 1990, and the perception that that would not be achieved over the final year of his contract, which prompted the club to act. The board's decision was unanimous, with the Frenchman to pick up around \u00a31m in compensation. While progress in the appointment of a successor will have to wait until the chief executive Rick Parry returns from a holiday in Barbados at the end of next week, Liverpool have already earmarked potential candidates for the position. That short-list includes the highly-rated Mourinho, whose representatives had tentatively contacted the Merseysiders earlier this year to sound them out. That approach was rejected, with the board backing Houllier at the time, though Liverpool will now attempt to deflect Chelsea's interest in the Porto manager in a bid to lure Mourinho to Anfield after all. Sources close to the Stamford Bridge club insisted last night that the Portuguese was still \"100% certain\" to take up the reins in west London, though he is known to be concerned about working under Roman Abramovich. Liverpool will attempt to play on those fears, pointing to the leeway and stability awarded Houllier throughout his time on Merseyside. Should Mourinho, whose Porto side compete in the Champions League final against Monaco tomorrow, sign the proposed four-year contract on offer at Chelsea then the Anfield board will turn their attentions elsewhere. The Valencia coach Rafael Benitez, Alan Curbishley and Gordon Strachan are all leading contenders. The prime criterion will be: \"Who is most likely to make us become challengers,\" said Parry. \"Track record will be important, but that's not to say that they must have managed in the Champions League or we'd be ruling out any English contenders.We want to see someone who has a passion for success.\" Mourinho aside, the trio of contenders would all also offer that much though Benitez intends to explore the possibility of eking more funds from his board before leaving the Mestalla. Richard Murray, Charlton's chairman, said of Curbishley: \"I don't know where it all comes from, but it happens every time there's a vacancy. Alan's signed a new deal in February. All I can do is get him on a new contract and on better money. If a manager has just signed a three-year contract do you then look to put a contingency plan in place? I know Rick Parry well and I haven't had a call from him. I know nothing.\" A decision on the new manager is anticipated early next month with Houllier's successor expected to mount a more coherent title challenge next term. \"It's about getting closer to success and getting the fans believing we're closer,\" said Parry. \"We're in the Champions League, but that was always a minimum standard rather than a goal in itself. In points' terms, this season has been worse than Roy Evans's final season back in 1998. \"That puts it into perspective, but it was still a decision made with the head rather than the heart. We asked ourselves whether we felt we would be challenging for the title next season without a change. The bottom line is that we didn't feel we would. A change was necessary.\" Houllier disputed that assessment at the private meeting with the chief executive where he learned of his fate, though he admirably maintained his dignity both on discovering the board's decision and at his Anfield farewell yesterday. By a twist of irony, he undertook his last duties as manager in the trophy room he had helped to stock in recent years. There was no bitterness in his speech, though the emotion was clear as he was driven out of the stadium for the last time. \"I had intended to carry on with my job, and I wanted to carry on with it,\" he said. \"But we have agreed to part company mainly because of the sudden excessive pressure on the board and myself. I thought it could be harmful for the players in next season's campaign.\" Liverpool finished the season 30 points behind the leaders Arsenal with disillusion welling in the stands and discontent mounting just as steadily from influential players concerned that the club may be meandering. They had won only 25 of the 64 Premiership matches since topping the table by seven points in November 2002, with Anfield too often engulfed in an air of mutiny. \"If we had lost the first two games of next season, it would have been intolerable,\" added Parry. \"G\u00e9rard himself acknowledged that much.\" The backroom staff - Phil Thompson, Christian Damiano and Sammy Lee - will remain at the club though their retention would need to be sanctioned by the Frenchman's successor. \"The club has considerably improved, both on and off the field,\" added Houllier. \"It must keep on developing. The club needs to understand that it cannot always have a quick fix, but it is in my heart. I may leave Liverpool, but Liverpool will never leave me.\" How Houllier compared to Anfield greats Bob Paisley Manager 1974-1983 League 1975-76 1st , 1976-77 1st , 1977-78 2nd , 1978-79 1st , 1979-80 1st , 1980-81 5th , 1981-82 1st , 1982-83 1st (six championships) League Cup winners 1980-81, 1981-82, 1982-83 European Cup winners 1976-77, 1977-78, 1980-81 Uefa Cup winners 1975-76 European Super Cup winners 1977-78 Joe Fagan Manager 1983-1985 League 1983-84 1st , 1984-85 2nd (one championship) European Cup winners 1983-84 League Cup winners 1983-84 Kenny Dalglish Manager 1985-1994 League 1985-86 1st , 1986-87 2nd , 1987-88 1st , 1988-89 2nd , 1989-90 1st , 1990-91 2nd (three championships) FA Cup winners 1986, 1989 Graeme Souness Manager 1991-1994 League 1991-92 6th , 1992-93 6th , 1993-94 8th FA Cup winners 1992 Roy Evans Manager 1994-1998 League 1994-95 4th , 1995-96 3rd , 1996-97 4th , 1997-98 3rd League Cup winners 1995 G\u00e9rard Houllier Manager 1998-2004 League 1998-99 7th , 1999-00 4th , 2000-01 3rd , 2001-02 2nd , 2002-03 5th , 2003-04 4th FA Cup winners 2000-01 Uefa Cup winners 2000-01 League Cup winners 2000-01, 2002-03 European Super Cup 2000-01 Charity Shield 2000-01"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
