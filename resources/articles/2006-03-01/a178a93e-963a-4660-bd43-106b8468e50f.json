He writes with languid derision about the \"apostolic awe\" Beckett inspired in the Royal Court's founding director, George Devine. \"Uncle Sam had the monstrous good fortune of actually looking like one of his own plays, a graven icon of his own texts. The bristled cadaver and mountain-peak stare were the ultimate purifier that deified all endeavour, pity or hope.\" He goes on to say that, were Beckett's face fatter and less heroic-looking, \"the response to that toneless voice might not have been so immediate\". He finishes by declaring with barely hidden distaste - and not a little glee - that George Devine was unable to secure an actor to star as Hamm in the English-language premiere of Endgame and he \"was reduced to having to attempt it himself ... It was brave but unmoving. It seemed a pretty long chew on a very dry prune [but] I would never have dreamed of saying so.\" Obviously, Osborne's view of Beckett is coloured by a natural and (from a fellow playwright's point of view) understandable professional wariness of another big noise on the theatre block at that time. Indeed, the apostolic awe Beckett still provokes in certain theatre practitioners and academics has perhaps not done him any great service in the eyes of his critics. Fandom of Beckett can easily tip into a kind of fetishism typified by theatres who never produce one Beckett play when they can mount whole festivals of his work (as is happening at the Barbican this month), or actors who perform so many of his plays that they become known, almost exclusively, as Beckett actors. But there is no denying his influence. No other modern playwright has inspired so many disparate types of artists and thinkers. He has influenced painters, sculptors, designers, film-makers, philosophers, choreographers, directors, actors, musicians and, of course, writers, in a way that could only have bewildered John Osborne. In my opinion, Beckett's plays are probably best seen in (ahem) isolation, as each one is a beautifully honed, determined, focused world unto itself. While seeing lots together will raise awareness of the similarity between the plays, it may not help us to see how distinct his best work is, even within his own canon. I believe that his plays will continue to echo through time because he managed to articulate a feeling as opposed to an idea. And that feeling is the unique human predicament of being alive and conscious. Of course, it's a very complicated feeling (and it's a complicated idea), but he makes it look simple because his great genius, along with his incomparable literary power, was the precision and clarity he brought to bear in depicting the human condition itself. That he did it with great warmth, humour and moments of deep sadness, which are some of the most moving one could experience in the theatre, also speaks of his craft as a monumental playwright. Any perusal of his plays must begin with Waiting for Godot (1952). This play has taken on, and will continue to have, a resonance similar to some of Shakespeare's greatest plays. Even people who have never seen it will have some idea of what it is like. In a bare, bleak landscape, two seemingly homeless old men, Vladimir and Estragon, attempt to pass the time while they wait for someone called Godot. The play spans two days (or two evenings really) and during both they experience oppressive boredom, random violence, unfruitful spiritual contemplation, real friendship, uneasy co-dependence, profound longing and, ultimately, a deep, crushing uncertainty. They have problems remembering the day before. They don't know whether to leave or keep waiting. There is no resolution in the traditional sense. But it's really a revolutionary play because it takes the human mind itself as its subject matter and brilliantly dramatises it by splitting it in two. Vladimir and Estragon speak to each other in the anxious, cajoling way human beings speak to themselves in their private moments. Fears are expressed and dismissed only to be unhelpfully reiterated in slightly different ways. Their feelings of love and hatred for each other jostle and even combine in the same impossible, tiny moment. Psychologists suggest that the difference between productive thinking and worrying is that productive thinking flows; it moves forward to some kind of conclusion or sense of resolve. Worrying is just the same few unsettling thoughts going round and round like an annoying tune. This is how Vladimir and Estragon communicate, and how they dramatise the subjective experience itself. Their quarrels and musings often conjoin to form a kind of inclusive flow, as though they share one mind, but it always ends in dissatisfaction. For example, near the beginning of act two, when they nervously talk about \"all the dead voices\": Vladimir: What do they say? Estragon: They talk about their lives. Vladimir: To have lived is not enough for them. Estragon: They have to talk about it. Vladimir: To be dead is not enough for them. Estragon: It is not sufficient. (Silence) Vladimir: They make a noise like feathers. Estragon: Like leaves. Vladimir: Like ashes. Estragon: Like leaves. (Long silence) Vladimir: Say something! Estragon: I'm trying. Without a third party to become a benchmark for their wandering speculations, they are doomed to encircle the same futile topics for ever - and they don't like it. They are waiting for Godot but they are also contemplating suicide. Like Hamlet, they are even powerless to end their lives as they suspect it may only deliver them into another, perhaps even more painful existence. Waiting for Godot, like Hamlet, is a benchmark in world literature because, in an entirely new way, it presents the anxious, modern, divided self as it witnesses the wanton cruelty of existence, unable to understand it, yet condemned to live it. It is the logical and emotional conclusion to the Cartesian foundation of our contemporary western world: \"I think therefore I am.\" With the existence of thought itself as our only constant, no higher being or deity can adjudicate for the modern rational mind. Considering that Beckett began writing plays in the aftermath of the horrific genocide of the second world war, a war in which he fought alongside the French resistance, it is a testament to his character that the plays, while skating on the thin ice of our mortality, can be so funny. Godot is full of verbal jokes and visual slapstick routines based upon - what else? - confusion and misunderstanding. While he opens the wound of the post-religious mind, at the same time he pours a salve of blessed warmth made possible only through the communal act of public presentation and laughter. The very experience of enjoying and understanding the play becomes its optimistic message, as opposed to anything glibly uttered by a character on the stage. With his next play, Endgame (1957), Beckett shifts his focus from his ruminations on human thinking and turns to an examination of human morals. It is a masterful play, full of jokes and real profundity, constructed like a vice that holds its ideas and pursuits centre stage in a riveting and disquieting way. Where Godot is set in an unforgiving, almost featureless exterior, Endgame is set in a kind of claustrophobic bunker. Hamm is blind and unable to walk. He is attended upon by Clov, who can just about get around, coming and going from the room to fulfil Hamm's childlike whims. He does so not only because Hamm holds the combination to the larder that feeds them, but also because there seems to be nowhere else to go. They can see out of two grimy little windows, which Clov hoists a ladder to reach, but there is nothing (or \"zero\") out there. The two other occupants of the room are Nagg and Nell, Hamm's parents, whom he has consigned to live in dustbins. It is a truly apocalyptic vision, almost a bulletin from the height of the cold war, with its constant threat of nuclear annihilation. But again, I like to see this play as a moving picture of the human mind - only this time it's what happens in the mind when we think about other human beings. The characters are racked with notions of responsibility and our desire to be free of it. Hamm works his way through the play trying to tell a story, or \"chronicle\" as he calls it, about how he was asked to take in a child to save him from starvation. This story causes Hamm great discomfort as he painstakingly pieces it back together, using many diversionary footnotes to prolong its conclusion. We come to understand that he is reluctant to reveal the ending as it places him in a moral catch-22 situation. If he refuses to save the child, does he have personal responsibility for his death, even though he did not personally cause it? And if he does save the child, has he accepted a logical responsibility to save anyone who is in a similar situation? He cannot possibly save everybody in the world and he fears that his inability to do so will only cause him further psychic pain. In response to this puzzling problem, he seems to have chosen to shut down his whole life. He implores Clov (who may be the child he once saved) to \"screw down the lids\" of the bins where his parents dwell. Cruelty seems easier than mercy to Hamm - it causes him less personal anguish. But Beckett strews the play with great humour and intriguing clues to Hamm's inner distress, suggesting that the sharp sting of moral choice is the price of being alive. An echo of the reluctant storyteller resurfaces in Krapp's Last Tape (1958). Once again we are presented with a divided self, but this time brilliantly and realistically achieved with the presence of a tape recorder. Tucked away in his little \"den\", Krapp listens back to old diary entries and comments on them with curses and angry fast-forwarding, as he prepares to add a new one. The tension in the play is generated by his search for and, we come to realise, fear of a meaningful moment. He seems to dismiss the recordings of his past selves with disgust, implying that his present self and tonight's recording of it will also be dismissed in the future. His life appears to be an exercise in literally marking time, recording his diminishing sexual adventures and his laughable inability to kick his dependence on alcohol - and bananas. But Beckett surprises the audience by allowing Krapp to stumble upon his 30-year-old account of a moment of perfect, almost trance-like bliss, in a punt on a stream with a past lover: \"We lay there without moving. But under us all moved, and moved us, gently, up and down, and from side to side. (Pause) Past midnight. Never knew such silence. The earth might be uninhabited.\" Krapp then attempts to dismiss this account with a new recording but finds himself listening to it again, motionless and spellbound as the play ends. It is a spinetingling few minutes in the theatre, as Beckett illustrates that even our own attempts to duck life's experiences and cast our memories aside is impossible, for to experience even a moment of happiness blesses us with a kind of cosmic faith that is beyond language, and thus beyond denial. Perhaps the supreme irony at the heart of Beckett's plays, and precisely the point that John Osborne missed, is that while he is often carelessly described as a 20th-century European existentialist who created hymns to \"nothingness\", he was in fact an Irish pagan who sought to celebrate the infinite mystery and endurance of the human heart through public rituals. His plays are not easy to perform and none can have been easy to write. But I believe that each one is enormously personal (perhaps this is why he never gave interviews), and while he always mercilessly stripped the work to its barest bones, at the same time he allowed his real feelings to shine through. This is what imbues his plays with their great power. They are also lovingly and respectfully shaped for an audience: this is what has made them enduring. And as long as they are performed with one eye on our spiritual longing, and another on the banana skin, they will continue to endure for generations yet to be born \u00b7 The Beckett Centenary festival opens at the Barbican, London EC2, on March 21.
