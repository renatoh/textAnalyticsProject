The man taking aim at animal products in organic farming", "bodyText": "Will Bonsall is a homesteader and 45-year vegan living in rural Maine with a message for Americans \u2013 your vegetables are \u201cvery un-vegan\u201d. Bonsall is an influential member of a small but growing group of vegan and organic \u2013 \u201cveganic\u201d \u2013 farmers, who want to revolutionize organic agriculture, which traditionally depends on animals byproducts such as cow manure. \u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of a disconnect, even hypocrisy, in vegans \u2026 We vegans like to put on our plates [vegetables] grown in methods that are very un-vegan,\u201d Bonsall said.\u201cMost organic agriculture is focused on moo poo,\u201d said Bonsall. \u201cCow manure, animal manure, but also blood meal and bone meal,\u201d he said. A vegan diet excludes all products derived from animals, including meat, dairy, eggs and honey. Often, these products are avoided for health, environmental and ethical reasons. Standard organic vegetable farming practices have used animal-derived products for centuries to boost soil fertility, such as cow manure, which farmers like Bonsall argue supports large-scale industrialized animal farming and, in his estimation, is unethical. But the question of whether organic farming should necessarily exclude animals is hardly settled. Even proponents of veganic farming describe it as \u201ccontroversial\u201d. The Rodale Institute helped develop the US Department of Agriculture standard for organic farming. Researchers there are pushing not for veganic methods, but for \u201cregenerative organic certification\u201d, which they hope can promote animal welfare, social justice and soil health. \u201cWe\u2019re at a point in time where our soils have been so degraded that it is actually becoming more and more difficult to grow crops in those degraded soils,\u201d said Jessica Lang, research coordinator for the Rodale Institute. \u201cThis word \u2013 regenerative \u2013 is one that really needs to get into the vocabulary of the general population,\u201d she said. Bonsall\u2019s is one of just 50 or so veganic farms in the United States, according to research by Professor Mona Seymour of Loyola Marymount University. Bonsall\u2019s method of growing \u201cperennial food crops with minimal fossil fuel and animal inputs\u201d, is laid out in his book, an Essential Guide to Radical, Self-Reliant Gardening. In a myopic sense, industrial agriculture \u2013 which uses nitrogen-laden synthetic chemical fertilisers \u2013 is vegan. They are not derived from animals and allow farms to grow vegetables that are bigger and more tightly packed together, and free from animal manure and byproducts. \u201cThe next logical step from that is growing organically but without animal manure,\u201d said Jenny Hall, a trustee of the Vegan Organic Network based in the UK, and co-author of Growing Green: Animal-Free Organic Techniques. Hall has been vegan for 25 years. \u201cWithin the organic movement it\u2019s still controversial,\u201d she said. \u201cBut actually, the reality is all plants are the original source of energy. In any ecological system plants are the bottom of the food chain, so it\u2019s really just following nature\u2019s cycle,\u201d said Hall. Industrial animal agriculture is one of the most environmentally damaging activities humans do, and many believe vegetarian and especially vegan eating could radically decrease greenhouse gas output. If the world adopted a vegan diet, a recent study in Science found, global farmland use would shrink by 75%, equivalent to the area of the US, European Union, China and Australia combined. Industrial animal agriculture is the second-largest contributor to human-made greenhouse gas emissions after fossil fuels and is a leading cause of deforestation, water and air pollution and biodiversity loss. Veganic farms remain small scale now, and less developed in the United States than in the European Union, where growers already have a certifying body, called \u201cbiocyclic vegan\u201d. In the US, there is no certification, and veganic produce is harder to find, though not impossible if buying direct from farmers, Hall said. To date, most veganic farmers are growing vegetables and fruits. As interest in veganic farming grows, the next phase of the movement is to bring onboard traditional grain farmers, Hall said. \u201cFor a long time, no one gave two poops about the organic movement, because it was just a bunch of hippies,\u201d said Bonsall. For decades, many argued if world agriculture went organic \u201cwe have to decide which third of the world is going to starve to death,\u201d because without petrochemicals farmers couldn\u2019t grow the necessary amount of produce. \u201cNowadays, there are lots of people doing it, and I\u2019m just another fly on the wall.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
