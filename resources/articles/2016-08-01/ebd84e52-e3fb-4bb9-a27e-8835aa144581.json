Investors have sunk around $38bn (\u00a329bn) into everything from prime London real estate to banks and football clubs according to figures from the American Enterprise Institute and the Heritage Foundation. Alongside the low-key property deals, Chinese companies have also struck deals to buy a string of household names over the past few years. Shanghai-based Bright Foods owns 60% of Weetabix after it paid \u00a3720m to get its teeth into the cereal company in May 2012, while Hony Capital paid \u00a3900m for restaurant chain Pizza Express in July 2014. Some of the UK\u2019s retail powerhouses are also under Chinese ownership, including the famous Hamleys toy shop on Regent Street, sold to footwear firm C.banner international for \u00a3100m in October last year. The House of Fraser department store chain is Chinese-owned, after Nanjing Cenbest paid \u00a3480m for an 89% stake in September 2014. The glamour of English football has also proved an attractive prospect for Chinese fans of the Premier League with money to spend. Dr Tony Xia bought Aston Villa for an undisclosed sum thought to be around \u00a352m in June, saying he wanted to restore the relegated club to its former glory and make it the \u201cbest known football club in the world\u201d. Villa\u2019s near neighbours West Bromwich Albion are on the verge of being sold to an investment group led by Chinese entrepreneur Guochuan Lai, while fellow Midlands club Wolverhampton Wanderers was bought by investment group Fosun International for around \u00a345m last month. Chinese investors\u2019 sporting ambitions also extend to golf, with the Wentworth club sold to Reignwood for \u00a3135m in September 2014, while Dalian Wanda Group paid \u00a3320m for 92% of Sunseeker Yachts in June 2013. Sovereign wealth fund China Investment Corporation is also a big investor in the UK. Its holdings include a \u00a3450m 10% stake in Heathrow Holdings, the firm behind the UK\u2019s hub airport, bought in November 2012."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
