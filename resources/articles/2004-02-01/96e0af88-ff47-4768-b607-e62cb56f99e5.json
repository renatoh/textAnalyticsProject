What does everyone have against Emma Thompson? Once it was, if I gleaned rightly, that she was young and talented and went to Cambridge. Then it was that she was married to Ken Branagh. Then it was that she wasn't. Now it's that she's ... what? Let's turn to our jolly friends, tabloid columnists Sue Carroll and Lynda Lee-Potter for guidance. Apropos Thompson's appearance in a pretty frock at an award ceremony last week Lee-Potter's take was that Thompson \"proved that you can tell a woman's age by her knees\"; Carroll claimed \"she'd only ever look hot to trot in jodhpurs\". Ladies, please! Emma is a goddess who not only snaffled herself the real-life Willoughby (Greg Wise), but is always the best thing in any movie she's in. And she looked totally gorge at that ceremony, and we know because we were there. So put a sock in it, all of you. HF Overexposed: rude T-shirts Oh, and they say fashion these days is crude and lacks poetry. What can they possibly mean? Madness, when Britney Spears is photographed wearing a belt reading \"F*** off\". Surely, not since Yves Saint Laurent expressed the 1970s liberation of women in his Le Smoking jacket has a garment had such an eloquent and powerful message. And if that wasn't enough sartorial brilliance, the very next day Justin Hawkins of the Darkness, not content with having singlehandedly rehabilitated the purple catsuit as a key element in every thinking man's wardrobe, wowed the fashion world with a T-shirt adorned with the witty and insightful question, \"Do you have a cock?\", which perhaps eclipses even the brilliance of the 'fcuk' slogan for lyrical elegance. What an exciting new direction fashion is taking! It is surely only a matter of time until bored suburban teenagers writing rude words on bus stops in Stevenage are snapped up by the house of Givenchy to design haute couture. Jess Cartner-Morley Pretend you know all about: shirt bags Unlike the ladies, we men are not peddled the latest must-have bag at the beginning of each season. Mind you, this is not to say that men's accessories don't follow trends. They do, just in a more subtle way. Right now, there is a trend emerging for super stylish, shirt-style-fabric bags, which are practical and roomy - surely the key ingredients for any decent man-bag? Better still, because they're not leather, they are affordable and vegetarian-friendly. Christopher Bailey at Burberry Prorsum leads the way with a fantastic selection of variations on a striped theme, which includes subtle pin-striped shoulder bags or wide, bold-striped alternatives. Junya Watanabe teamed a pale blue ticking-like rucksack, with a matching jacket. Also in on the trend is Topman, whose selection of drawstring beach-style bags and pale gingham check shoulder numbers tick all the right style boxes. So boys, dump the dodgy briefcase, lose that tatty carrier bag, and snap up one of these babies. Carting your clobber around has never been so stylish.
