I don't live anywhere near a river but water had run off the street into my garage following heavy rainfall. The policy was with Legal &amp; General, which took the premium in full. Five months later Be Wiser told me that L&amp;G no longer wanted to insure me. I wasn't happy but expected a refund for the seven months remaining. I was astounded when Be Wiser told me that I hadn't been insured at all during that time and that it was refunding the whole premium, \u00a3327. Initially Be Wiser said it had failed to complete the paperwork properly but later said it was computer failure. Now it won't answer my calls and it still hasn't give me any money back. Until it does I can't afford to buy another policy and, when I do, I will have to declare that I've been turned down for insurance. BS, Wallington, Surrey L&amp;G discovered your flood claim while it was conducting a routine review. L&amp;G does not take on properties that have suffered from flood, even if it was not caused by swollen rivers. This is why it cancelled the policy from the start. It agrees that you had volunteered the information so the question is: why was this not picked up before you paid the premium? L&amp;G says Be Wiser did not tell it about your flood claim. Be Wiser responded to this, saying \"utter disbelief would be an understatement\". We eventually found a confusion between two questions in the online application \u2014 you were not in a flood-prone area but you had made a claim for flood damage. Be Wiser has now refunded \u00a3327 and will also pay the full year's premium for a replacement policy. L&amp;G has recorded this as \"not taking up your policy\" rather than \"cancelling\" it so you do not need to disclose the fact to future insurers.
