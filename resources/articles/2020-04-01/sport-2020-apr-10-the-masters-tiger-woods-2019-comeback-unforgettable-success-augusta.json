They needn\u2019t always arrive at the tournament\u2019s 72nd hole. If the Hogan Bridge, Butler Cabin and Magnolia Lane define Augusta National, its celebrated tournament also has reference points throughout the sprawling acreage. When Ian Poulter is taken back to the Masters Sunday of 2019, he recalls his view from the 13th tee. Poulter was one of a quartet from the tournament\u2019s closing two groups \u2013 each consisting of three players, unusually \u2013 to find water at the 12th. Behind him Tiger Woods played safe on the world\u2019s most famous par three and found dry land. \u201cI looked across as he hit his shot into the middle of the green and from that point he had control of what he was doing,\u201d says Poulter. \u201cIt was inevitable.\u201d \u201cIt\u201d was a 15th major championship, Woods\u2019s first since 2008 and a conquest for which words barely deliver justice. The intervening 11 years had witnessed adultery shame, fitness woes and a form slump that triggered the widespread depiction of a fallen hero. Tremors reverberated beyond sport as this instantly recognisable figure conjured the ultimate redemption tale amid wild, uncharacteristic celebration. Courtesy of a win in 2013, Adam Scott has automatic entry to one of sport\u2019s most exclusive spaces: the champions\u2019 locker room at Augusta National. Having signed off with a 73 for a share of 18th, 12 months ago, Scott seized an unexpected opportunity. The Australian discovered \u201cseven or eight\u201d past Masters champions gathered round a television. \u201cI came in having finished and they were all sitting there,\u201d says Scott. \u201cI thought: \u2018This is cool.\u2019 I mean, you don\u2019t all hang out that much. You don\u2019t get that group of people together very often. There was definitely a fraternity feeling. Everyone was very excited that Tiger was doing what he was doing. \u201cAs I was finishing my round you got a sense, as he was taking the lead on the back nine, that something special could be happening. There\u2019s always an electricity in the air at Augusta on a Sunday, but then when Tiger or certain people are in the mix there\u2019s something more. All of us were definitely cheering hard for Tiger to win. You just had that sense it was a significant moment in the sport again.\u201d This was no standard Masters denouement even before Woods set pulses racing. Storms forecast for Augusta ensured early tee times and those three-balls as opposed to pairs. Woods started day four two shots adrift of Francesco Molinari, tied with Tony Finau and one ahead of Brooks Koepka. \u201cWe had never really been in contention on the last day of the Masters so it didn\u2019t feel \u2018different\u2019 for us,\u201d says Ricky Elliott, Koepka\u2019s caddie, of a dawn alarm call. In theory, Woods wouldn\u2019t be helped by the swift turnaround from a late Saturday finish to a 9.20am start, considering the lingering stresses of multiple back surgeries. \u201cI thought it was advantageous to the guys who hadn\u2019t won [the Masters],\u201d Woods recalls. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have to sit on that lead and think about it far into the afternoon. But I hadn\u2019t been in this experience, either.\u201d Woods was pursuing another first: to win a major when not leading after 54 holes. From a personal nadir \u2013 Woods was found by police slumped behind the wheel of his car in May 2017 and charged with driving under the influence \u2013 there had been traces of a full professional recovery. Woods won the Tour Championship at East Lake in late 2018. Shortly before the Masters, Woods knocked Rory McIlroy out of the WGC Match Play in Texas. \u201cHe played very well,\u201d says McIlroy. \u201cI could see him as one of the Masters favourites on the back of what I saw there. He was driving the ball better. With how good his iron play is, if he drives it well he will always have a great chance at Augusta.\u201d Woods had Georgia on his mind all right. \u201cAugusta started probably back in October, November,\u201d he said last February of his Masters planning. You cannot win the Masters on Thursday or Friday but you can sure as hell lose it. A 70 and a 68 had Woods one stroke from the halfway lead, held by a quintet including Scott, Molinari and Koepka. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t much conversation with Tiger during those first two rounds,\u201d says Jon Rahm, one of his playing partners. \u201cBut that isn\u2019t unusual at a major.\u201d A Saturday pairing with Poulter led people to highlight the \u201cnew\u201d Tiger. In 2018 the duo were also third-round companions but nowhere near Masters contention. \u201cHe shot five under, I shot four under and I played great,\u201d says the Englishman. \u201cAt that point I was thinking: \u2018If I can have another day like that I might have a chance.\u2019 He was ready, he had all the shots and was pretty damn good. He had more of his game together than a year earlier, by a mile. There was a buzz out there all day Saturday. Playing with him was fun, but you could sense he was lurking.\u201d It felt as if 99% of the Sunday gallery \u2013 10 deep in places \u2013 were manning the 1st fairway as Woods, Molinari and Finau appeared on the tee. By midday, Woods strode to the 10th trailing the Italian by one. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt this, if I\u2019m within six of the lead starting the back nine on Sunday, I\u2019ve got a shot at it,\u201d Woods says. Poulter had Koepka and Webb Simpson for company in the penultimate group. Koepka\u2019s threat to Woods was obvious: the Floridian arrived at the 83rd Masters having won on two of his previous three major outings. With Molinari holding a two-stroke lead, Koepka and Woods were level at 11 under par before disaster, namely Rae\u2019s Creek, struck for the reigning US Open and US PGA champion at the 12th. \u201cWe were a couple behind Frankie so I think Brooks felt he had to do more and changed his line a little bit,\u201d explains Elliott. \u201cHe maybe lost a bit of patience. If he had been in the last group and seen everyone in front dunk it in the water he might have thought differently.\u201d Molinari\u2019s horrid capitulation also started at Golden Bell. The Italian, who brushed Woods aside en route to Open Championship glory the previous July, shared fifth from such a commanding earlier position. \u201cHaving the Claret Jug and winning a major not long before already told me I was able to do it,\u201d Molinari says. \u201cIn some ways it made the disappointment a little bit bigger; that time I wasn\u2019t able to close it out.\u201d Elliott can reel off Koepka\u2019s closing stretch as if it were yesterday. \u201cEagles 13, great chance at 14 and left it short, 15 I thought he had holed it for eagle, 16 the ball just stayed above the slope ...\u201d The key, though, is that Koepka was \u201cright back in it\u201d. Woods delivered a crushing blow to all the young pretenders with a glorious for-the-ages tee shot at the par three 16th, almost resulting in a hole-in-one. The Olympic swimming legend Michael Phelps, in the gallery directly behind Woods, was among those caught in the moment. Elliott adds: \u201cWe were on the 17th tee when Tiger\u2019s shot came in. We were pin high, standing on tip toes watching it. It looked like it was going in the hole. So it\u2019s incredible to be there, in that moment even though Brooks was still in the hunt. Tiger now had a two-shot lead but that\u2019s no gimme at Augusta. \u201cWe were playing catch-up all day and it didn\u2019t really feel like we gave it away. In hindsight, if he had holed a couple of putts it could have been a backdoor win. We were never ahead, always behind, so we weren\u2019t kicking doors in afterwards. It was an unbelievably exciting day.\u201d Woods\u2019s playing of the last was conservative. And rightly so. A bogey five would be sufficient for victory, meaning the champion-in-waiting found himself short and right of the putting surface in two. \u201cWhen I was walking up on the green, to see my family and friends there through the chute, I started to get a little bit emotional,\u201d Woods says. \u201cI had to rein it back in and say: \u2018Hey, it\u2019s not quite over yet.\u2019\u201d When it was, Woods couldn\u2019t anticipate he would have to wait at least 19 months for a title defence. Through horrible, unforeseen circumstances, this somehow manages to add to the allure of what transpired on 14 April 2019. An enduring story has been allowed a broader canvas. No one who witnessed this will ever forget it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
