A pacy, tricky, touchline-hugging winger, the 20-year-old with a touch of the young John Barnes impressed down the right in the first half and the left in the second. True, his final ball was sometimes wayward but Kamara looks too good for the Second Division and the same goes for Burnley's Glen Little and Robbie Blake. Though that duo helped secure victory, principal credit should go to Graham Branch, really a midfielder or defender who, pressed into service as an ersatz centre-forward, scored the opener. \"It's a big win for us, a massive win,\" said Stan Ternent. \"And particularly considering we've got another massive game against Derby on Saturday.\" Wimbledon are already down but, pressing assiduously, they began in determined mood. Indeed David Martin - the teenage son of the former West Ham luminary Alvin, making his debut in the visiting goal - initially had little to do. Martin was underemployed until the 26th minute when his first serious call to arms concluded with the ball nestling in the back of the net. That goal began with a left-wing cross from Paul Weller - his parents were fans of the Jam - met by Little's head at the far post. Although Martin parried, Branch headed home, setting Burnley on course for the first of the two victories Ternent deems essential for survival. Wimbledon were unlucky not to equalise when, with Brian Jensen wrong-footed, Gary Smith's swerving shot rebounded off the post. But Burnley scored again at the end of the first period when Harry Ntimban-Zeh headed an own-goal after colliding with Martin as they both went for the ball. \"That killed us,\" said Stuart Murdoch, who must have been encouraged by his side's refusal to fold. Ditto Kamara's performance. \"I don't want to say too much, because there were a few managers in the stands, but Malvin's young and quick and strong,\" he said. \"Who knows how far he might go?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
