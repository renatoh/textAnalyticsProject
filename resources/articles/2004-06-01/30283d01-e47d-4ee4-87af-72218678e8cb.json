When the samba drums first throbbed along the Bois de Boulogne seven years ago, Kuerten was unseeded and all but unknown. His relationship with French crowds - their \"Guga\" - was immediate, and they still hold him dear. He has struggled with injury problems since his third French Open victory when he had surgery on his right hip. This year the former world No1 retired in the Barcelona event at the quarter-final stage and missed both the build-ups in Rome and Hamburg. Little was expected of him in Paris, but after his straight-sets victory over Roger Federer the expectations have gradually risen. Tomorrow he plays David Nalbandian, who reached his first quarter-final here with a 7-5, 6-4, 6-7, 6-3 win over Marat Safin. Argentina now has four players in the last eight, its best collective showing at a grand slam, though the prospect of all-Argentinian semi-finals is not thrilling. The French are praying for something more varied. Kuerten, who defeated Spain's Feliciano L\u00f3pez 6-3, 7-5, 6-4, remains circumspect about his chances of winning for a fourth time. He is never sure exactly how his hip will react. \"Sometimes it's very painful and I get very frustrated,\" he said. \"It's a question of trying to strike the right balance and not go beyond my limits.\" But to beat Nalbandian he may have to. L\u00f3pez said: \"I'm not sure he has the physical condition to withstand five sets at the highest level. He is playing well but it will be tough for him if he gets into a really long match.\" Lleyton Hewitt slipped into the last eight for the second time in four years with a 7-5, 6-2, 7-6 win over Xavier Malisse, who had back problems. The Australian next plays Argentina's Gast\u00f3n Gaudio, who had a comfortable 6-4, 7-5, 6-3 win over Russia's Igor Andreev, last week's victor over the defending champion Juan Carlos Ferrero. Hewitt has much more confidence on the clay this year, principally because he played more build-up events. \"It's also a question of experience. I've been to a slam final a couple of times and that always stays in the back of your mind - that and my never-say-die attitude.\" This showed in the third set against Malisse, who led the tie-break 6-3. Safin, having survived two previous five-set matches, ran out of gas. His fingers had blisters on blisters. \"I just couldn't concentrate,\" he said, \"and David is one of the most talented players on the tour. He has really great hands.\" Which the Russian did not."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
