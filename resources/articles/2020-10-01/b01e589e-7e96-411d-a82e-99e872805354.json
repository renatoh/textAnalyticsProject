Professor. It is the prefix he uses for Carlo Ancelotti, and Carlo Ancelotti alone. The Brazilian does not need to open his mouth to articulate his admiration for the Everton manager. He is an Everton player for a start, having rejected Champions League overtures from clubs such as Atl\u00e9tico Madrid to be reunited with his former Napoli coach. The lure of working with Ancelotti again proved enticing for Allan and James Rodr\u00edguez in the transfer window and Everton, having won their first seven games of a season in all competitions for the first time since 1894-95, are already reaping the benefit of stellar acquisitions. But professor? It may fit the old Everton moniker of \u201cThe School of Science\u201d but this is a personal tribute from the club\u2019s talented and tenacious new midfielder. Allan breaks into laughter when asked to explain. \u201cI think I refer to him as professor because of the way he reads the game, the way he prepares for games and the relationship he has with the players,\u201d says the 29-year-old, signed for an initial \u00a322m after five years with Napoli. \u201cHe gets the best out of us. He is a maestro and if you look at his history and success in the game it speaks for itself. He has won everywhere he has gone and he is the type of person who deserves the best words to describe him. \u201cIn Italy we tended to refer to the coach as \u2018Mister\u2019, which is the case for all the coaches, but Carlo Ancelotti is a great guy, a really high quality coach who manages to keep all the players satisfied, motivated and happy.\u201d Allan admits Ancelotti was a key factor in his decision to swap Naples for Merseyside, along with the owner Farhad Moshiri\u2019s ambition to challenge the leading lights of the Premier League. \u201cI spoke to Professor Ancelotti and we spoke about the project he had here with the team, the building of the new stadium and having Everton consistently at the top of the table. Working with Carlo Ancelotti weighed heavily on my decision, also the size of Everton as a club. There were other bids and interest from elsewhere but Everton had been interested in signing me right from the start. When you see this desire and commitment I didn\u2019t have to think about it twice. I put the other bids to one side and focused on signing for Everton.\u201d The Rio-born midfielder, who has surprisingly made only nine appearances for Brazil, has been fundamental to Everton\u2019s instant transformation this season alongside his fellow newcomers Rodr\u00edguez and Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9. It is one of the many pities of the current situation that Goodison has not been packed to acclaim them. Allan, with his intelligent distribution, relentless work rate and ferocious will to win, is the type who would be embraced. \u201cUs players really miss the fans,\u201d he says. \u201cEspecially for me as a new player in the Premier League. I\u2019ve watched the Premier League for years and I know how passionate and fanatical the fans are. Hopefully this great form and moment we are going through will carry on until the fans come back.\u201d Rodr\u00edguez has captured the imagination and headlines since his arrival from Real Madrid but, according to Allan, he receives no special status on the training ground. \u201cWe played against each other once before \u2013 Real Madrid versus Napoli in the Champions League \u2013 and I kicked him once or twice. I\u2019ve kicked him once or twice in training too,\u201d he says with a smile. \u201cIt is a lot better having him as a teammate than as an opponent. James Rodr\u00edguez is a player of immense quality. He has had a great start to his career in the Premier League and without a doubt that is just the start. There is a lot more that he can give, a lot more that he can offer to make the Everton fans very happy.\u201d As befits his position on the pitch, Allan is content for others to take the glory providing he remains part of a winning team. \u201cAs a deep-lying midfielder sometimes a really important tackle is like a goal or an assist and I celebrate that,\u201d says a player who has been known to rise from a challenge with a euphoric fist-pump. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who scores, whether it is Richarlison, Dominic [Calvert-Lewin], James or one of the centre-backs. The important thing is getting the win. My preference is to be at the top of the table rather than scoring goals.\u201d And so to Liverpool and what Allan, an Everton player for only six weeks, already knows as the \u201c10-year taboo\u201d. His club have not beaten their local rivals for exactly a decade but his own record against J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team is vastly superior: two wins, one draw and one defeat in four Champions League games for Ancelotti\u2019s Napoli. He credits the record with a familiar term. \u201cProfessor Ancelotti and his coaching staff are highly intelligent and they prepare for every detail to face the opposition. Through that we came out on top most of the time against Liverpool. Every game against Liverpool is difficult but thank God we got the better of them the majority of times. Hopefully it will be no different on Saturday.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
