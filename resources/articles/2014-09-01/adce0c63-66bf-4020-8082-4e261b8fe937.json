The menswear stays true to the Whistles philosophy. The clothes are, as Passmore says: \"Contemporary, easy to wear, linked to classics, but with a modern approach.\" This translates to an overcoat with sloped shoulders for extra slouch, simple coloured sweaters and sportswear that includes the perfect marl joggers and minimal trainers. It's a capsule wardrobe for a modern man \u2013 not too scary, but not too boring. \"The Whistles' man cares about style over fashion,\" says Passmore. \"But he's confident enough to pull off a fashion forward piece too.\" Sounds like someone we'd like to meet."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
