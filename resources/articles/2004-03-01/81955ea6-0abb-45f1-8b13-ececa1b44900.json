Will we end up having to doss down under a eucalyptus tree a dozen miles from the match? Don't worry. Special Places To Stay In Portugal has dozens of gorgeous places with rooms still available. To enjoy the football, you don't have to have a ticket to a match - just head down to the nearest square or bar and soak up the atmosphere with the locals. When you're not watching the footie, jump in a car to explore the surrounding area, although in some cases you may not need to as public transport in Portugal can be excellent. Many Special Places have space as I write; here's a selection of properties in or near the nine match venues.
