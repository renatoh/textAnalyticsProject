I think that\u2019s one of the most exciting games I\u2019ve ever played in. It was a game that\u2019s had absolutely everything \u2013 from controversial decisions, VAR decisions, to a comeback victory \u2013 I mean what else can you ask for?\u201d As Elise Kellond-Knight succinctly captured, more than any game so far at the France 2019 World Cup, Australia\u2019s remarkable 3-2 win over Brazil deserved to be acclaimed as a celebration of football. Two nations bound in mutual distemper, packed with champion players, either at their peak or in the twilight of their powers, scrapping and fighting with an intensity and determination that was palpable from the stands. Whereas some teams play with physicality and others with skill, both the Matildas and Canarinhas were exemplars of both. Tamires\u2019 nutmeg on Emily Gielnik, Cristiane\u2019s cool juggle, Sam Kerr\u2019s remarkable improvised first-time finish that almost caught out Barbara. And yet somehow, amid all the reaction to this pulsating game, a stubbornly resistant thread of negativity has crept in once again. Kerr\u2019s buoyant post-match expression of personality was branded \u201cimmature\u201d, some even questioned whether the \u201chaters\u201d she was responding to even existed. Commentators from back home concluded that Kerr must be mistaken \u2013 because all of Australia was behind the Matildas. An entirely acceptable claim if you\u2019re oblivious to the homophobic or sexist abuse hurled daily at female players \u2013 something that\u2019s exacerbated by an environment in which a months-old controversy is given greater prominence throughout the first week of the tournament than the voices or the actions of the Matildas themselves. There are no shortage of remarkable stories from within this tight-knit group of players. Hayley Raso\u2019s recovery from a broken back, Lisa De Vanna\u2019s quest to score at a fourth consecutive World Cup, even player of the match Chloe Logarzo\u2019s star turn in Montpellier, just a few years after nearly walking away from the game. Kellond-Knight, a player coming into France 2019 under an injury cloud, not only made a positive return against Brazil, but completed 90 minutes for the first time in three months, solving Australia\u2019s left-back conundrum at the same time. Logarzo and Tameka Yallop got through a power of work in midfield, but more than that, their positive aggression helped tip the scales Australia\u2019s way as the match progressed. To come away clutching at a cloud from one of Australia\u2019s biggest silver lining evenings takes almost a wilful ignorance of the sheer joyousness fans witnessed in Montpellier. With so much pressure, and potentially the Matildas\u2019 World Cup hopes on the line, the win over Brazil finally shuts down some persistently nagging questions \u2013 firstly, whether the players have bought into Milicic\u2019s footballing vision, and secondly, whether it can be a successful one. \u201cPeople don\u2019t understand the belief we have in this team,\u201d said Kerr. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand the confidence we have in each other, the confidence we have in Ante.\u201d Accidentally leaving her player of the match trophy at the press conference, Logarzo quipped that she\u2019d left it behind deliberately for \u201ccoach\u201d \u2013 \u201cthe real player of the match\u201d. \u201cI think that win was definitely for Ante,\u201d Logarzo said earlier in the night. \u201cThe criticism is more on his behalf, and it\u2019s really disheartening for us to hear that because the amount of belief he\u2019s instilled in us and the amount of work he\u2019s put in is incredible.\u201d The players have told us time and time again \u2013 before and during the tournament, offering glowing endorsements of Milicic\u2019s attention to detail, sophisticated tactical planning, and ability to pick up the playing group again after the tumultuous events of January. The result against Brazil was impressive, but it was the manner in which it was achieved \u2013 only the second time in World Cup history a team has successfully turned around a two-goal deficit \u2013 that deserves celebrating. A fervent adherent to process, Milicic often declines extensive comment on a performance until he\u2019s \u201crun the tape\u201d. After the Italy game, the Matildas supremo\u2019s assessment remained upbeat. \u201cWe dominated possession. We dominated shots on goal and we dominated territory. We created enough chances to win the game but unfortunately we\u2019ve made an error in build up \u2026 I really feel like we deserved something from the game, but that\u2019s the World Cup. We got nothing.\u201d In game one, Italy were arguably denied a legitimate goal, Australia were caught napping the 95th minute. Against Brazil, Australia were arguably denied a legitimate penalty early on, but then rewarded with a winning goal that some considered contentious. \u201cThat\u2019s football, isn\u2019t it?\u201d reflected a glowing Kellond-Knight in Montpellier. \u201cYou have to take it, you have to put the ball in there, you have to make luck in a way. Sometimes people say goals are just luck but you\u2019re making the luck \u2013 you\u2019re dominating the game, you\u2019re making the play, so in a way we created those chances, with a bit of fortune.\u201d The Matildas haven\u2019t transformed from a low-confidence team under an untested coach to tournament contenders again in just five days. And disproportionate criticism in defeat is not evened out by unbridled adulation after victory. As the Brazilian adage goes, people have two ears and one mouth, and should use them in that proportion. Listening to the players themselves rather than foisting preferred narratives upon them might just be a decent starting point. After all, there could yet be plenty more twists and turns left in store at France 2019."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
