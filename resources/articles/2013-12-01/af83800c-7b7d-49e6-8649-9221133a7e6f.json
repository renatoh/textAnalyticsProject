The 40-year-old former Holland international, sent off in the 2-1 defeat at Salisbury after he picked up two yellow cards \u2013 the second for kicking out at an opponent \u2013 told local media: \"I don't think I am going to play any more because they are taking away the fun. \"I think I know for definite now that the league is targeting Barnet. I don't know how many games we have played now but there is weird decision-making all the time. It is ridiculous, especially the first [yellow card] because everyone can see I cleared the ball. That was an absolute disgrace. The other one for the red card was also a disgrace. \"I am a target \u2026 I want the team to do well. If you look at the red cards, some are definitely red cards and some are exaggerated. It is hard to complete our tasks when a lot of decisions are against you.\" Barnet are ninth in the Conference, three points from the play-offs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
