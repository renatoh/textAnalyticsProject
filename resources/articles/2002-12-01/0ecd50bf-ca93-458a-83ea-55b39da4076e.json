Thus we know (those of you who'd rather wait, look away now) that Brummie rapper Mike \"The Streets\" Skinner has four nominations, Will Young is up for something (what, or even why, is not clear) and the horridly rich Robbie Williams is only up for one. But the BPI has testily challenged the accuracy of the story. A source told us, \"It's full of mistakes. For instance, it said Robbie is up for one, but it's more like two.\" Ah. Thank you for that. Armed with that knowledge, On the Record is off to the bookies. The Streets official site Will's official website Robbie Williams official site The Brits Which handily leads us on to the subject of end-of-year lists. December is the time when pop critics are compelled to impress readers with their appreciation of the most \"challenging\" CDs of the last 12 months. This tradition is enshrined in Section 7 of the Critics' Code which states that \"Critics shall, in the guise of the-end-of-year-list, contrive to make readers feel as if they have missed the boat because they don't have any of the albums listed. This is also known as Reminding Readers of Their Place. And The Streets will undoubtedly turn up in many such lists, along with the ludicrous 23-member Polyphonic Spree and, perhaps, The Coral - who are actually all right, for Liverpool psychedelia merchants. Naturally, they're not on On the Record's list. Instead, our Best of 2002 is devoted to those little moments that reaffirmed our faith in pop. And no, Ms Dynamite isn't on it either, because she irritatingly misspells her first name Niomi (sic). The Polyphonic Spree official site The Coral official site Thus, in no particular order, we have: 1. Bubba Sparxxx stripping onstage at his first London gig. The burly Bubba, touted as the next Eminem, was so overcome by love back in February that he tore off his clothes in front of a horrified crowd. Not a pretty sight. He has since disappeared from public view. Bubba Sparxxx official site 2. Liza Minnelli going hip hop. The lovely Liza had evidently got wind of rap being the next big thing, so she had a crack at it herself in April at her Albert Hall comeback gig. However, gay men continue to adore her. 3. Tom Jones also going hip hop. Sadly, his collaboration with Wyclef Jean stiffed when the public decided there are some things that a 62-year-old man from Wales just shouldn't do. Caroline Sullivan on Tom Jones' hip-hop makeover 4. The spate of \"intimate\" gigs by the likes of Elton John and Bon Jovi. It's touching that they has become so accustomed to stadia that the 3,000-capacity London Astoria counts as intimate. Official Elton John site The official Bon Jovi site 5. Liam Gallagher's front teeth. What a relief that Nicole Appleton hasn't managed to civilise Our 30-year-old Kid. Oasis official site 6. Ozzy Osbourne singing Paranoid at the Golden Jubilee gig. Don't worry, he's not a monarchist - he just had no idea where he was. Ozzy.com 7. The Pop Idol axis of evil nearing its end as Gareth Gates' and Will Young's current singles fail to reach number one. Ha ha ha ha ha. UK Top 75 singles And of course, no end-of-year list would be complete without a giving a mention to Robbie Williams' neuroses, Kylie Minogue's tush and Wacko Jacko's nose. We feel we've been up close and personal with them all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
