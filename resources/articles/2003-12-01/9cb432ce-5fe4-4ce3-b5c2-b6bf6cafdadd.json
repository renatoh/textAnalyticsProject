The report, by Egg, said that 51% of Britons claimed to suffer in some way last January following holiday excesses. The most common problem was weight gain, with 27% of people feeling fatter after Christmas. A quarter of people said the holiday period left them feeling lethargic, while 18% claimed to suffer with general depression. However, a third of Britons have good intentions for the new year and plan to get themselves financially fit in 2004. The most popular desire was to pay off overdrafts, followed by swapping existing credit cards for one with a cheaper rate of interest. \"Body and mood tend to swing from the adrenaline high of indulgence in December, to a depleted low state-of-being in January - made worse by any feelings of guilt of regret,\" commented psychologist Donna Dawson. \"It is definitely a form of annual 'festive depression' that we need to be made aware of, so that we can either minimise its impact or devise a plan of action to cope with the consequences.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
