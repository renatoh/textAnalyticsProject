I'm knackered, having just returned from New York, they're tired from their first week back at school, and it's raining. This calls for a \"nest day\" \u2013 lying on my bed, watching TV and eating lots of unhealthy food. They want to watch Will &amp; Grace. They've loved it ever since we stayed at a friend's house whose DVD collection consisted of nothing but this and Inspector Wexford. I find it odd that they love the show quite so much; you'd imagine that two boys aged eight and 15 might prefer Harry Potter or Doctor Who. At least they've got a good sense of humour. I leave them watching their third consecutive episode, munching happily on fish fingers, to go and pack for the Milan fashion shows. This obviously takes some time. \"Dad, what are you doing?\" calls Aidan, the eldest, an hour later. \"I'm just outfitting; won't be long,\" I reply. \"What's outfitting?\" he asks. \"It's when you put together the outfits you're going to wear before packing them.\" \"Oh.\" \"Finished my fish fingers,\" pipes up Ed. I leave the half-folded suit on the floor (accompanying shirt to be decided) and return to the bedroom with a mini Hoover \u2013 the chocolate sisal is a nightmare to keep clean. \"Dad,\" says Aidan, \"is Will gay?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
