In a collaboration with English National Opera, the theatre\u2019s artistic director, Timothy Sheader, has created a bewitching show full of charm, surprise and enough ribald wit to keep the lid on schmaltz. Adults singing children\u2019s roles can push up the squirm factor to an uncomfortable level. Not here. The bustling presence of children and students from ArtsEd, Pimlico Musical Foundation and Bird College conservatoire ensured a youthful and engaging atmosphere. Above all, the mezzo-soprano Rachel Kelly and soprano Susanna Hurrell, singing the title roles of the children lost in the forest, were unbeatable: credible, touching, and terrific actors and singers who know when to stop. Both have burgeoning careers at the Royal Opera House and elsewhere. They were transformed beyond recognition here, lanky, ageless children in denim dungarees and check shirts. Conducted with flair and impetus by Ben Glassberg, members of the ENO orchestra, hidden behind a screen, played a reduction of the score by Derek J Clark, which turned all into admirable soloists. The loss of Humperdinck\u2019s heavy, Wagner-inspired textures if anything liberated the piece, suiting the open-air context and leavening some of the work\u2019s weightier psychological implications. So this production, in David Pountney\u2019s familiar and robust translation, is unburdened by undertone: no message about the planet, or poverty, or child molesters, or the risks of E numbers in houses made of luridly coloured iced biscuits. Were you buying it, this Hansel and Gretel would be in the \u201cfree from\u201d aisle. Duncan Rock as the ribald, drunken father, and Rosie Aldridge as the tight-lipped, oppressed mother, have stylish stage presence. Gillian Keith\u2019s Sandman and He Wu\u2019s Dew Fairy contribute memorable cameos, all helped by Peter McKintosh\u2019s beautiful designs. The witch herself, played by Alasdair Elliott in vulgar drag, red kitten heels and polka dot slit dress, is straightforwardly mean and nasty. Among many skilful touches, Sheader and movement director Lizzi Gee turned the 14 angels who protect the sleeping children into shiny, blond-wigged, white-uniformed flight attendants (that whole dream sequence worked triumphantly); trees are made of upturned broomsticks; gingerbread children\u2019s eyes glow green; the family\u2019s wooden house is transformed before our eyes into part of the forest, then turns into the witch\u2019s house: enough magic, but enough sap and vigour too. You can catch Hansel and Gretel elsewhere this season, with Susan Bullock playing both mother and witch at the Theatre in the Woods at Grange Park Opera. This is the bicentenary of Jacques Offenbach (1819-80), though you may not have realised. German-born, French by adoption, the composer best known for the lyricism of Les Contes d\u2019Hoffmann or the slapstick of Orph\u00e9e aux enfers doesn\u2019t sit quite comfortably in the British operatic landscape. The humour in his operettas lacks the steely edge of Gilbert and Sullivan, or perhaps their essential French charm is lost in often effortful translation. Garsington Opera has form with his rarities. After Vert-Vert in 2014, this year they have staged the UK premiere of Fantasio (1872), a late flop about a court jester, not short of rapturous music and exuberant choruses but whichever way you read it, a thin tale. At first sight it didn\u2019t look promising: Toulouse-Lautrec and De Chirico meet the Munchkins. Yet there\u2019s a tender melancholy to the music (appreciated, too, by Mark Elder, who conducted it in a concert performance in 2013 and a recording for Opera Rara), and several showpiece numbers, which Garsington\u2019s cast and orchestra, conducted by Justin Doyle, performed impressively. Jennifer France was outstanding as Princess Elsbeth. Her sparkling coloratura arias were a reminder of how versatile this rising-star soprano is (recently seen as Ophelia in Brett Dean\u2019s Hamlet, and as Ice in Stuart MacRae\u2019s Anthropocene). Hanna Hipp, too, played the title role with panache. She, France and the rest of the soloists, notable among them Huw Montague Rendall as the Prince, did their best to deliver the screeds of spoken dialogue, cleverly translated by Jeremy Sams. Even his skills couldn\u2019t disguise the weakness of the original material. The chorus sang excellently, and their routines were well rehearsed and nimble. Directed by Martin Duncan and designed by Francis O\u2019Connor, Fantasio is a once-in-a-lifetime piece. That\u2019s to say, you won\u2019t want to see it twice. Let\u2019s be grateful, though, that places such as Garsington exist to give us the chance. For Offenbach favourites, ENO has a new Orpheus in the World directed by Emma Rice in the autumn, and Blackheath Halls Opera is staging La belle H\u00e9l\u00e8ne next month. Can-cans all the way. The tenor Mark Padmore, a resident artist at this year\u2019s Aldeburgh festival, joined forces with the baritone Roderick Williams, pianist Julius Drake and, as narrator, the actor Rory Kinnear for a programme at a sold-out Snape Maltings entitled The Sea, The Sea. If only all concerts had this elegance and variety of construction. Far-ranging, including songs by Haydn, Faur\u00e9 and Schubert as well as Stanford, Britten and Tippett, it scotched any narrow idea of an island race and embraced wider horizons. As an encore all four performers, Drake and Kinnear too, sang \u2013 winningly \u2013 an arrangement by Roderick Williams of Shenandoah: a river, not a sea but I expect it gets there eventually.
