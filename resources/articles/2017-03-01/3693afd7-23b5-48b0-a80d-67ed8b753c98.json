It is a vignette of extended nastiness that reminded me of something by Neil LaBute, all about a fight between two women. The title both announces and pre-empts the possibility of our voyeurism. It is set in a sketchily imagined satire-future, where a new war on terror has been announced in the US. Sandra Oh is Veronica, an obnoxious trophy wife married to a wealthy military contractor. She is appalled at her teenage son\u2019s ambitions to be an artist. With a shudder, she remembers a college contemporary who had similar hopeless plans. Then, at a super-posh cocktail party, she runs across this very woman, Ashley (Anne Heche), a struggling artist who has humiliatingly been reduced to helping with the catering. On the staircase outside, their intense and irresistible mutual dislike, also fuelled with secret self-hate, escalates into out-and-out fisticuffs. It\u2019s a original movie that tries to hit you in the face with irony. The energy levels finally plummet, but it lands a few punches."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
