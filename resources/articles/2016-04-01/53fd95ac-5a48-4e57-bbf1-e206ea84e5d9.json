When the handle is collapsed in, the weapon looks nearly indistinguishable from a smartphone device. \u201cSmartphones are EVERYWHERE, so your new pistol will easily blend in with today\u2019s environment,\u201d the manufacturer\u2019s site reads. \u201cIn its locked position it will be virtually undetectable because it hides in plain sight.\u201d The weapon is selling for $395, substantially less than the current generation of flagship mobile devices, and is expected to be available in mid-2016. A spokesperson for the ATF said the agency had no comment. Schumer worried that such a concealable weapon would make it easier for people intending to commit violence to evade law enforcement. \u201cWhy would we want to make it easier for criminals or terrorists like those who attacked Paris and Brussels to wreak havoc?\u201d he said. Widespread availability of the device could also lead police officers to uncertainty in tense interactions with citizens. \u201cImagine a scenario in which a police officer is not able to tell whether a violent criminal is pulling out a gun or an iPhone,\u201d Schumer said. Even without the Ideal Conceal weapons available, officers sometimes claim they mistook a mobile device for a weapon after a shooting incident. Federal law mandates that toy guns be marked with a \u201cblaze orange\u201d tip to differentiate them from real ones, but those laws do not work the other way. Some jurisdictions ban the disguise of real guns as fake, but laws intended to prohibit the disguise of guns as other objects are less clear. \u201cTypically guns that can be concealed, guns that look like wallets, pens and knives, are illegal under the law,\u201d Schumer later said in a statement. A provision of the National Firearms Act does address what it calls \u201cAny Other Weapons\u201d including concealable firearms. At the time of the act\u2019s passage in 1934 this meant devices such as pen guns, wallet guns and umbrella guns. The devices were not banned outright by the act, but rather required to be registered, taxed more heavily than a traditional firearm, and their manufacturing subject to approval by the ATF. Failure to obtain this clearance for a disguised explosive weapon like the smartphone gun constitutes a felony under the act. Neither the ATF nor the manufacturer immediately responded to an inquiry on whether this approval had been granted. Adam Winkler, a professor of constitutional law at UCLA, said the NFA was intended to restrict the type of firearms criminals use and said the smartphone gun fits that description. \u201cThis kind of gun is not preferred by law-abiding people generally,\u201d he said, noting that they are often less reliable. \u201cIf you\u2019re a criminal, though, having a gun that\u2019s less effective but more disguised becomes a priority.\u201d In his statement, Schumer also pointed to the fact that the weapon might be illegal under laws that require guns to appear a certain way by x-ray. Ideal Conceal\u2019s CEO, Kirk Kjellberg, said on an appearance with Fox Business that he is working with the Department of Homeland Security so they can \u201cproperly train their folks on how to detect this\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
