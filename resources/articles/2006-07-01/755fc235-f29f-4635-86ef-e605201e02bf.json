But that hasn't stopped T-Mobile, which has teamed up with CoPilot to offer a GPS system as part of a package that also features a Nokia N70 World Cup 3G phone. Until now, CoPilot's GPS systems have only worked with Windows-based phones and not Symbian models like the N70. Does it work? The screen seems large enough to deliver the maps. Unlike most satnav systems, the maps disappear after each major turn, which made the system less distracting than most. Sound quality is still an issue, however. The system also boasts a few innovations, the most useful of which enables the car to be tracked via a web page. Users can also take calls while using the GPS. This is an ideal system for people who only occasionally use satellite navigation. It costs pounds 200 if you don't buy the phone, but the system and phone are free on some T-Mobile tariffs. \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
