John William Gott died shortly after his fourth term of imprisonment with hard labour, in 1922, during a seaside vacation paid for by The Rationalist Press Association. At the appeal hearing (supported by the National Secular Society), the lord chief justice, Lord Trevethin, had said: \"It does not require a person of strong religious feelings to be outraged by a description of Jesus Christ entering Jerusalem 'like a circus clown on the back of two donkeys'. There are other passages in the pamphlets equally offensive to anyone in sympathy with the Christian religion, whether he be a strong Christian or a lukewarm Christian or merely a person sympathising with their ideals. Such a person might be provoked into a breach of the peace.\" John William Gott is buried without a headstone in Scholemoor Cemetery, Bradford.
