Stash a batch in the freezer ready for eating at any time. Prep 20 min Chill 2-4 hr Cook 14 min Makes 7 60g unsalted butter, softened 100g dark brown soft sugar 25g caster sugar 1 egg 50g dark chocolate, melted in the microwave or over a bain-marie 110g plain flour 10g cornflour 15g cocoa powder \u00bd tsp bicarbonate of soda 105g white chocolate (in a bar) Maldon salt, to finish Cream the butter and the sugars until pale and fluffy. Scrape down the bowl, add the egg and beat again. Pour in the melted chocolate and mix. In a separate bowl, stir the remaining dry ingredients until evenly combined. Tip into the chocolate mixture and stir until no lumps remain. Scrape into a container and put in the fridge until the dough sets \u2013 two to four hours. Divide the dough into 50-55g balls and flatten slightly. Chop the white chocolate into 15g portions (it\u2019s OK if this is in chunks). Put these into the middle of the dough balls and fold up the sides to cover the white chocolate. Put on a tray lined with greaseproof paper, leaving enough space in between each one for them to spread, and refrigerate overnight (or freeze). Heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5. Bake for 14 minutes. Leave to cool on the tray, then remove and eate. If baking from frozen, defrost first or add one or two minutes extra to the bake time. Mascarpone, macadamia and sour cherry This is a great no-chocolate cookie. The macadamia nuts add a beautiful crunch to contrast with the softness of the dough and sharpness of the cherry. Its base is made with mascarpone to keep them soft for days after baking. Prep 20 min Chill 5 hr Cook 14 min Makes 12 100g unsalted butter, softened 100g mascarpone 140g caster sugar 2 egg yolks 200g plain flour 50g ground almonds \u00bd tsp baking powder 1 pinch salt 100g roasted macadamia nuts 90g sour cherries or dried cranberries In a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment fitted, gently beat the butter and mascarpone until well combined. Add the caster sugar, mix, then add the egg yolks and mix again. In a separate bowl, mix the flour, ground almonds, baking powder and salt. Add to the machine and stir until no lumps remain. Add the macadamia nuts and dried fruit, stirring until the cherries are evenly distributed. Chill the dough in the fridge for four hours, until firm. Divide the dough into 12 even balls \u2013 each should weigh 60-65g. You could decide to freeze the dough at this stage (in which case, simply defrost, then bake as per the instructions below). Put the cookie dough balls on a tray lined with greaseproof paper and chill in the fridge for another hour. Heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5. Bake for 14 minutes, then leave to cool on the tray before removing and eating. All spice, apple and oat cookies This oaty cookie is fantastic for snacking. It uses homemade apple sauce as its base and the result is not too sweet. Prep 30 min Chill 1-2 hr Cook 22 min Makes 10-11 150g bramley apple, peeled, cored and diced , plus 70g extra, finely diced 75g caster sugar 1 egg 60g unsalted butter, melted and cooled \u00bd tsp ground allspice \u00bd tsp ground cinnamon \u00bd tsp bicarbonate soda 1 pinch of salt 145g rolled oats 110g plain flour In a small saucepan, gently cook the apples and sugar over a medium heat with a splash of water until soft and mushy, leave to cool, then blend to a pulp. Whisk the sweetened apple sauce with the egg and melted butter, add the bicarb and whisk (it will froth up, but this is OK).

Transfer the mix to a container and refrigerate for one to two hours, until cold. Heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5.
