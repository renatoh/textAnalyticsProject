The broadcast focuses on a teenage boy as he prepares to deliver a mock presidential address. Although he can\u2019t see them, the eyes of kids around the world are on him; each one of them finding new ways to connect during the Covid-19 lockdowns \u2013 and sharing their encouragement over a chatlog. \u201cI stand before you today as the leader of this great country,\u201d begins 14-year-old Yuwaalaraay teenager Dean Touma, as he shares his vision of increased education funding, reduced homelessness and stronger respect for ancient Australian cultures. Touma is one of 8,000 high school students currently enrolled in Aime, a mentoring program built on encouraging the dreams and ambitions of marginalised kids. \u201cAime gave me a chance to speak; it gave me a voice and helped me realise how to be myself and how to be proud as an Indigenous woman,\u201d says fellow mentee, 15-year-old Lucy Brown. \u201cIt\u2019s really freeing knowing that you\u2019re not alone and there\u2019s so much support when you open up to people,\u201d she continues, reflecting on her last three years in the program. Aime, which normally runs as a series of face-to-face workshops, has recently been transformed into a weekday, lunchtime television show named Imagi-Nation TV. The show, which takes place over 30 minutes through YouTube live broadcast, gives kids the chance to showcase the skills they\u2019ve learnt through the physical program, and practise them for their peers. \u201cWe want to unlock kids\u2019 imagination capacity so they can start working on their own self-authorship and their own story,\u201d says the Aime CEO and co-founder, Jack Manning Bancroft. \u201cWe want to help them \u2026 rewire their mindsets from a world that tells them they can\u2019t to a world that tells them they can.\u201d Each week, Imagi-Nation TV introduces a new theme, ranging from Forgiveness (13 April) to Empathy (20 April) and Asking Questions (8 June), with the opportunity for kids in the program to address the live audience in a segment titled Youngsters. The program also invites guest speakers, who have so far included the film-maker Taika Waititi, musician Ben Lee, journalist Stan Grant, puppeteer Randy Feltface and influential creative director Margaret Zhang on to the show to share their own lessons, and features musical interludes and the occasional puppet. \u201cOnce we saw that there was set to be a billion kids\u2019 educations affected by Covid-19 [around the world], we knew that we could play a role as a mentor in these kids\u2019 lives,\u201d says Manning Bancroft. \u201cNot just through this moment but well into the future.\u201d Imagi-Nation TV streams Monday to Friday 12pm AEST on YouTube."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
