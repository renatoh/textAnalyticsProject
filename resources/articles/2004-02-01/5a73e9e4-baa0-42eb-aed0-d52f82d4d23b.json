The clothes of 1983, for instance, were once consigned to the bin marked 'never again'. Yet current fashion editors think nothing of touting acid yellow as a desirable shade. The Darkness have successfully resurrected the camp excesses of Queen. They have done this in part by cunningly peddling a false sense of nostalgia for a music no one with a modicum of taste would have been caught dead liking at the time. In other words, they are kitsch. And so to the Scissor Sisters, the latest hip exhumers of long-forgotten horrors. On the surface, they are rather like the Village People, only more camp: four men and one woman of various amorous dispositions who have emerged from New York's flamboyant performance-art underground into a welcoming musical climate. Last January, it was the turn of disco rockers Electric Six to bask in this limelight, before the Darkness's comet eclipsed them. The year before, it was Fischerspooner, the New York performance art-disco duo who, despite the hype, never made it. The Scissor Sisters are named after a slang term for lesbians and have songs called things like 'Tits on the Radio' and 'Filthy/Gorgeous'. Like Fischerspooner, they've been embraced by the fashionable, who are suckers for anything boasting sexual innuendo or a garish visual style. You could get a tax inspector to mouth the word 'rimming' repeatedly over a child's keyboard groove and have the next catwalk soundtrack hit: it really seems that easy sometimes. The Scissor Sisters are both worse and better than this. Better because, unlike Fischerspooner, they have more than one song with which to court the mainstream. They have 11 on their debut album (plus two UK bonus tracks) and each one is a proper song, with substance, melody, dynamics and everything. Only one tune is not theirs: 'Comfortably Numb', an anthem of Pink Floyd's audaciously reworked as a dancefloor-filler in the style of the Bee Gees. 'Lovers in the Backseat' (about cruising) can be traced straight back to David Bowie. And 'Return to Oz', a surprisingly moving song mourning the impact of the drug crystal meth on the gay community, revisits Pink Floyd again. The Scissor Sisters's saving grace, if you don't like theatrical disco-rock, is their unimpeachable songwriting, a talent which suggests they may yet outlive the doldrums of January. But Pink Floyd? As though the Sisters's unlikely homage to the British prog-rock kings was not enough to make one pause, there are also the influences of Elton John and Billy Joel to contend with. John and Joel are two artists who were banished from the realms of good taste long ago (even before shoulderpads), singers all right-thinking people believed would remain unequivocally bad for all time. Yet here are Elt-like ballads addressed to 'Laura' and 'Mary', all lilting pianos and ripe sincerity. But the Scissor Sisters don't stop there. Their debut makes hip disco fodder from Supertramp, possibly the last bastion of naffness. Surely, Supertramp cannot be redeemed. You can imagine a younger Jake Shears, the lead Sister, being lured into a speculative purchase by the band's name, so reminiscent of a grand hussy. (He's partial to Steely Dan, too, a band named after a dildo.) But to fall in love with these bands' music? And yet, if Scissor Sisters sound like anything, it is Supertramp's glossy, adult-oriented rock. Supertramp sold lots of records, as does Elton John. (Adult-oriented rock is designed to do precisely that.) It will be fascinating to see if the Scissor Sisters can follow the Darkness into mass approval. In the meantime, if you fancy a dose of nostalgia for music no one cool was ever into at the time, you could do worse than listen to this."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
