If you can't be bothered clicking on it, one of the more interesting extracts features Tottenham manager Juande Ramos saying that his side \"are like Sevilla [his old club]. To have a trophy now would take a lot of pressure off the team so they can work more calmly with the aim of then fighting to be up there with the best teams - to be in the top four, to go for the Champions League, to win more trophies.\" Elsewhere in today's Observer, my colleague the environmentally friendly Portsmouth and England goalkeeper David James writes about how winning the League Cup with Liverpool meant so much to him that he completely forgot he'd trousered a medal. He reckons that, for Chelsea fans, a win today would mean \"just another trophy\", because the League and Champions League will always take preference. So there you have it - depending on a Premier League club's station in life, winning the Carling Cup either buys them some time until they win something decent, or gives their fans a nice day out to tide them over until they win something decent. Of course none of this realism has prevented a certain satellite television channel we all know from hyping up today's encounter as \"the hottest ticket in town\" and \"a must-see game\". Here's hoping. The teams are in Tottenham: Robinson, Hutton, Woodgate, King, Chimbonda, Lennon, Jenas, Zokora, Malbranque, Berbatov, Keane. Subs: Cerny, Kaboul, Tainio, Huddlestone, Bent. Chelsea: Cech, Belletti, Carvalho, Terry, Bridge, Wright-Phillips, Essien, Lampard, Obi, Anelka, Drogba. Subs: Cudicini, Joe Cole, Ballack, Kalou, Alex. Referee: Mark Halsey (Lancashire) Preamble So now we know. Chelsea fourth official John Terry and assistant manager Frank Lampard are in the starting XI, while Alex and Joe Cole drop to the bench. There's no place for Ashley Cole in the squad - which I'm sure will disappoint his many millions of fans around the world. The only selection of note in the Tottenham side is Paul Robinson, who starts in goal instead of his recent-replacement Radek Cerny. Pre-match niceties Click-clack! Click-clack! Click-clack! Click-clack! With the house PA blaring out a soundtrack that sounds like it's been purloined from a Tim Burton-directed gothic horror, the teams stride purposefully out of the tunnel and line up opposite each other. They're introduced to some old men in blazers, then opera singer Natasha Marsh sings the national anthem. Both teams are wearing their usual home strips today, with Spurs in white and Chelsea in blue. 1 min: The preliminaries have been endured and proceedings are now under way. Chelsea kick off, but only after John Terry has finished wandering around his half of the pitch giving all his team-mates big pre-match hugs. Has it really come to this? Robbie Keane almost scores within 18 seconds after latching on to a sloppy pass from Juliano Belletti. He surges forwards and shoots, but his effort is defected wide for a corner, from which nothing comes. 2 min: Just over two minutes in and Spurs have already grabbed the game by the scruff of the neck and given it a good shake. They're tearing into Chelsea, who don't know what's hit them. John Terry and Frank Lampard won't appreciate impudence like this. 4 min: Chelsea eventually get the ball out of their own half, with Lampard picking out Nic Anelka a couple of yards inside the Tottenham half, over by the sideline. The Frenchman immediately loses possession. 5 min: For Tottenham, Steed Malbranque wins the ball over on the left wing, makes a fool out of Juliano Belletti and cuts inside. He pelts towards goal on a diagonal run, but slices his cross-cum-shot wide. If you put the farm on Chelsea to win this game, be afraid. Be very afraid. 7 min: Corner for Tottenham, which Pascal Chimbonda wins after skinning Belletti, who's having a shocker so far. It's swung in to the far post, where Chimbonda directs a looping header on to the crossbar. Great effort. 9 min: Dimitar Berbatov gets between Ricardo Carvalho and John Terry and on to the end of a cross from the left. He heads a fairly straightforward scoring opportunity wide. Tottenham really do own Chelsea at the moment. 12 min: \"No Cashley in the squad!\" notes Andrew Sidford, possibly with a sharp intake of breath ... or a loud guffaw. \"That extra five grand a week must be coming in handy today. It's a bit it harsh on O'Hara not being in the squad for Spurs.\" 14 min: Having got off to a flier, the game has simmered down a bit. That said, Spurs are still in complete control. 16 min: Dimitar Berbatov wins a free-kick for Spurs about 10 yards outside the Chelsea penalty area after drawing a foul from John Terry. Jermaine Jenas curls a beautifully weighted dead ball in towards the far post, where Jonathan Woodgate hurls himself at it. It's a mite too high and the ball skims off his head and over the bar. 20 min: Speaking of hurling, my mother and several of my mates have just texted me to let me know that in the really important match of the day, my home-town of Birr have beaten Dunloy in the All Ireland senior hurling semi-final in Clones and will play Portumna in the final at Croke Park on St Patrick's Day. I don't know about the rest of you, but I booked my flight weeks ago. 22 min: Anyway, the football. With nearly half an hour gone, Chelsea have yet to muster anything even vaguely resembling a shot at goal. They've been very poor so far. 24 min: \"This game is an Arsenal fan's nightmare,\" writes Paul, who I'm presuming is an Arsenal fan. \"I am praying for the game to be abandoned due to some freakish weather incident and the Carling Cup not to be awarded this year. Is that too much?\" My advice to you is to relax, Paul. When push comes to shove, it's only the Carling Cup. Everyone will have forgotten about it by lunchtime tomorrow. My big worry is that there'll be extra time. 27 min: Petr Cech throws himself down and to his left to parry a low Steed Malbranque drive around the upright and out for a corner. Good effort, good save. 28 min: A long-range Frank Lampard effort fizzes high and wide of Paul Robinson's goal. Both the Lampard wedding ring finger and club crest will remain unkissed for the time being. 30 min: \"Since this game is turning into a bit of a bore, lets have your Oscar predictions,\" writes Theresa Daughtry. I'd love to Theresa, but I'm afraid Chelsea have a corner. 32 min: Chelsea win a free-kick about 10 yards outside the Tottenham penalty area when Didier Zokora upends Subbuteo's Shaun Wright-Phillips. Didier Drogba sends the free-kick fizzing a couple of feet wide of the right-hand upright. 35 min: Is it a coincidence that this game is becoming less interesting as a spectacle the more Chelsea creep their way back into it? I think not. Anyway, we could certainly do with a goal and I hope Ellen Page gets the Best Actress gong for her sterling work in Juno. I saw it the other day and it's a great movie in which she is a revelation. GOAL! Spurs 0-1 Chelsea (Drogba 38) Didier Drogba scores with a free-kick from about 30 yards out straight in front of goal. It was a very saveable waist-height effort that left Paul Robinson looking very flat-footed and foolish indeed. Drogba won the free-kick himself after being on the receiving end of a foul that earned Didier Zokora a yellow card. 42 min: Spurs fans, along with most neutral fans, I expect, will be sickened by this state of affairs. Spurs have enjoyed the lion's share of the possession and squandered several good scoring opportunities. Now it looks as if they're going to go in for their half-time cuppas a goal down. Still, if nothing else, it should make for an interesting second half. 44 min: Dimitar Berbatov and 40,0000 Tottenham fans appeal for a penalty when the Bulgarian striker goes down in the box under pressure from - I think - Shaun Wright-Phillips. A replay shows that referee Mark Halsey's decision to wave play on was the correct one. 45 min: Robbie Keane appeals for a penalty after being nudged while contesting a high ball with Roberto Carvalho on the edge of the Chelsea penalty area. His pleas fall on deaf ears and again, it seems the referee's decision not to award a penalty or free-kick was spot on. Half-time analysis \"It won't make for a remotely interesting second half, because Chelsea, England style, will park the bus and play for 1-0,\" sniffs a disgruntled Mac Millings. \"Excitement will only come if, England style, they do it spectacularly badly.\" \"Drogba went down like his leg had been cut off when Zokora stood on his toe. He then got up, slammed home the free-kick and ran off with two of his team-mates on his back,\" writes Jason Brennan, who is also displeased. \"It's good to see yesterday's occurrence in the Arsenal game has brought some humility to today's game. Didier Drogba, humanitarian of the year!\" \"I think Spurs have got a goal in them,\" says Jamie Redknapp on Sky Sports. Meanwhile, Chris McHugh is here with his Oscar predictions. \"Emmanuel Adebayor has to be favourite for Best Actor after his frankly breathtaking swan-dive against United? Failing that, King Kev should win a Razzy for doing a worse messiah impression than Jim Cavieziel in the Passion of the Christ.\" 46 min: Tottenham get the second-half started, while the huge number of red seats on view would suggest that Carling's feeble efforts to get the prawn sandwich brigade away from their half-time troughs by offering to donate money to charity for every bucket-seat with a backside in it at the start of the second half has been a dismal failure. 47 min: Didier Drogba wins a free-kick just inside the Tottenham half for colliding with Aaron Lennon. 49 min: \"Not all neutral fans are rooting for Spurs,\" writes Nathaniel Goggin and several other folk whose names don't look as good in print as Nathaniel Goggin's does. \"After all, there are a handful of teams whose chances at Europe would be significantly reduced if Tottenham were to win. I can't be the only Villa supporter holding my nose, averting my eyes and half-heartedly muttering 'Go Chelsea'.\" 51 min: Didier Drogba limps off to get treatment on the sideline for what looks like a knee injury. Chelsea throw-in, deep in Spurs territory, which is chucked back towards the half-way line, where Ricardo Carvalho strokes it back to Petr Cech. That's a disgrace, even by Chelsea's low standards of entertainment generation. 54 min: There is nothing noteworthy going on. Nada. Rien. Sweet eff all. 57 min: Spurs launch a sortie into Chelsea territory, which is broken up by Frank Lampard, who launches a long cross-ball field towards Nic Anelka on the left wing. He picks out Drogba, who crosses for Shaun Wright-Phillips. Unsurprisingly, it's too high for the smallest man on the Wembley sward. 59 min: Aaron Lennon wins a corner for Spurs off Wayne Bridge and takes it himself. His delivery isn't the best and Didier Drogba is able to clear at the near post. 61 min: Tottenham substitution: Tom Huddlestone on, Pascal Chimbonda off. The sulky Frenchman is not one bit happy about being substituted and heads straight for the sanctuary of the dressing room after taking an eternity to dawdle off the pitch. 63 min: Robbie Keane's life flashes before his eyes as Shaun Wright-Phillips nips between him and Paul Robinson to pounce on an errant back-pass. Robinson saves the Irishman's bacon, interrupting a memorable image of rosy-cheeked young ne'er-do-wells on bareback piebald ponies being chased through Tallaght by police. 68 min: Penalty for Tottenham after Wayne Bridge handles the ball three times in quick succession in the Chelsea penalty area. GOAL! Spurs 1-1 Chelsea (Berbatov 69pen) Dimitar Berbatov slots home one of the most coolly-taken penalties you'll ever see. Cech went one way, the ball went the other, curling away from the Chelsea goalkeeper into the bottom left-hand corner. 72 min: A vital interception from Jonathan Woodgate prevents Didier Drogba from putting Chelsea in front again. 73 min: Chelsea substitution: Shaun Wright-Phillips off, Saloman Kalou on. 74 min: Tottenham substitution: Steed Malbranque off, Teemu Tainio on. 76 min: Corner for Spurs, which Aaron Lennon sends in from the left. Again, he drops it short allowing Chelsea to clear. The penalty Spurs won came on the back of great work by Lennon on the left, whose cross Wayne Bridge quite obviously controlled with his arm under pressure from Huddlestone. The linesman flagged immediately, the referee pointed to the spot and Chelsea's self-appointed fourth official John Terry proceeded to embark on an impassioned rant about what he perceived to be the grave injustice of it all. The Chelsea captain then refused to give the referee the ball. 80 min: Spurs blow an astonishingly good chance to take the lead. Robbie Keane puts Didier Zokora through one on one with Petr Cech, who did well to stay on his feet and save the shot with his face. The rebound fell kindly for Zokora, who proceeded to balloon this god-given chance at redemption over the crossbar of the gaping goal. 83 min: It's all Spurs at the moment. Tainio and Berbatov both miss good chances to score a winner, but Petr Cech foils the pair of them. 84 min: From wide on the right of midfield, Michael Essien lofts a long pass towards the edge of the Tottenham six-yard box for Didier Drogba to try and get a leg on. It doesn't bounce kindly for the Ivorian, who was mere inches away from making contact. 88 min: Chelsea substitution: Michael Essien off, Michael Ballack on. 89 min: Frank Lampard has a shot from distance, which goes high and wide. 89 min: Tottenham win a free-kick in the Chelsea half, which Tom Huddleston fails to get past the first line of defence. Some of Tottenham's set-piece deliveries this afternoon have been abysmal. There'll be three minutes of stoppage time, then extra time. 90 min: Free-kick for Tottenham about 40 yards out, which Jenas sends into the mixer. Chelsea clear and Tottenham win a throw-in down near the half-way line. They get the ball back into the Chelsea penalty area, where Robbie Keane's ambitious attempt at a bicycle kick ends up sending the ball out of the stadium. 90+2 min: Peep! Peep! Peep! Mark Halsey brings an end to normal time with three shrill blasts on his referee's whistle. Tune in shortly for 30 minutes of extra time. Extra Time 1min: Tottenham kick off. The Chelsea doctor spent most of the interval asking Petr Cech who the prime minister is and what year it is. It's not that he's competing in a table-quiz and needs help with the answers, but because there appears to be some concern that the goalkeeper might be a bit concussed after that late Zokora pile-driver in the chops. GOAL! Spurs 2-1 Chelsea (Woodgate ET 3) Jonathan Woodgate embarks on a manic celebration after scoring in only his fourth appearance in a Tottenham shirt. Jena sent a free-kick into the Chelsea penalty area from the left which Petr Cech came out to collect, but missed. He was beaten to the ball by Woodgate, whose header hit the goalkeeper and bounced once ... twice ... over the line and into the goal. A bad mistake by the Chelsea goalkeeper helps put Spurs ahead. ET 8 min: Chelsea substitution: John Obi Mikel off, Joe Cole on. ET 9 min: Free-kick for Chelsea, on the left hand side of the Tottenham penalty area. With everyone expecting a cross, Frank Lampard cheekily tries to rifle the ball straight in to the near corner. It's on its way in until Paul Robinson intervenes - if he'd let that in he might as well have retired on the spot. ET 12 min: Tottenham substitution: Younes Kaboul on, Robbie Keane off. Spurs are clearly hoping to shut up shop. ET 15 min: There'll be two minutes of added time at the end of the first period of extra time. Got that? Good. ET 15+1 min: A vital interception by Alan Hutton prevents Kalou from capitalising on a Jonathan Woodgate error. \"So Woodgate misses a header then Cech misses his punch and the ball is bundled into the net - a goal worthy of the occasion,\" observes Gary Naylor. \"Re: Oscars. I reckon Berbatov, suitably attired and tiara-ed, would enjoy the red carpet.\" Half-time in extra time ET 16 min: Chelsea restart the game 2-1 down and immediately win a corner. Lampard sends the ball into the penalty area where it misses everybody, eventually falling to Joe Cole, whose high, wide slash prompts a chorus of wolf-whistles from Tottenham's fans. ET 19 min: Playing five across the back and Berbatov on his own up front, Spurs seem happy enough to try and soak up everything Chelsea can throw at them for the remaining 10 minutes. Expect the kitchen sink to come flying into their penalty area before too long. The metaphorical kitchen sink, that is, although if Paul Robinson gets hit by a stainless steel basin with hot and cold taps thrown on to the pitch from behind the goal, I'll be sure to let you know. ET 22 min: Robinson saves well with his feet from Kalou moments after Didier Drogba had a shout for a penalty turned down. Spurs are living dangerously here while Chelsea turn the screw. ET 25 min: From the halfway line, Belletti hoofs the ball into the Tottenham box, where Ledley King heads the ball straight into the path of Joe Cole, who snatches at his shot and makes it easy for Robinson. He should have scored. ET 29 min: Everyone is forward for Chelsea, everyone is back for Spurs, who are defending desperately. ET 30 min: There'll be three minutes of added time at the end of extra-time. Aaron Lennon gets booked, presumably for time-wasting. ET 30+1min: Corner for Chelsea, which Paul Robinson comes out to pluck from the air and misses completely. Drogba heads it towards the empty goal, but his effort is hacked clear. ET 30 + 2 min: Jermaine Jenas gets booked, presumably for time-wasting. The whistles of the Tottenham supporters are ringing out around the stadium and Mark Halsey duly puts them out of their misery with three long shrill peeps on his whistle. It's over - Tottenham Hotspur have won their first trophy in nine years and are this year's Carling Cup champions. Post-match shenanigans: As gracious in defeat as they are in victory, Chelsea's players surround the referee and start whingeing like spoilt children because he blew for full-time while they were in possession of the ball. Petr Cech gets booked for his troubles, while some security goons shepherd Didier Drogba, among others, away from the match official. You lost, fair and square ... try to deal with it like grown men. Presentation Led by John Terry, who is shaking his head from side to side and looking particularly cheesed off, Chelsea's players tramp up the 107steps to collect their losers' medals from Lord Mawhinney. They're followed by an ecstatic Tottenham team, on whose behalf Ledley King receives the cup and hoists it skywards."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
