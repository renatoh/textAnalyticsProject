He likes to show me how one can understand what it is to be poor from viewing Celso Lagar's A Traveling Circle and that women can comprehend the feeling of wartime defeat from Lotte Laserstien's After War. He buys books, visits galleries and hangs artworks on every wall in our flat. However, I remain just as ignorant of western art works. I don't like to be overwhelmed by the details in western drawing and the western fullness of colour. I want to be allowed to imagine and experience the artists' feeling and thoughts in my own way, guided by the simple lines, economic use of colour and empty spaces in Chinese and Japanese paintings. I want to share more with my husband, so I called our friend Lei Lei, a Chinese artist, who understands the painting of both our cultures and explores the differences in his work. \"Come to our house, we could talk about this during a meal, I will cook for you.\" He spoke with the tone of a demanding Chinese man, but a man cooking for women is a western cultural phenomenon. Lei Lei's house could be described as a gallery or an artist's workshop, but it is also a place full of Chinese culture. He welcomed us with western kisses and hugs, his wife Caroline appeared like a Chinese wife with apron and wet hands from the kitchen. While Lei Lei cooked, he gave me my first art lesson. His knowledge was steeped in ancient Chinese philosophy - the root of Chinese art - but my level of knowledge was too poor to understand everything. As a naughty student would, I decided to go to the bathroom. The walls along the stairs were full of paintings. I liked almost every one. I realised that the ones I thought were Chinese were painted by Caroline, and others, which seemed clearly western, were by Lei Lei. How could Caroline understand Chinese culture so well and how could Lei Lei so succesfully influence his western wife? This is exactly what Toby and I wanted to learn from them. This was much more important than all that academic knowledge. On my return, the lesson changed to women's studies. Caroline told me the following story in Chinese: \"It was years ago, about 1990, when I came back from China. My feeling was that I had had enough of it. I felt the need to be truly English and reconnect with my own identity. It was about then that Lei Lei came into my life and it was almost as if I was punishing him for the hardships I had endured. For instance, he spoke in English most of the time when he could easily have spoken Chinese. In his quest to win my heart, he invited me and some old friends around for supper. \"When I arrived, he said to me: 'I want you to serve the rice!' His voice was insistent. I shrugged and said it was fine. 'I also want you to pour the tea,' he added, in a similar commanding way. Throughout the meal I did as he asked. I spooned out the rice, I poured the tea and as I did so he paused in his conversation to check that his friends had noticed. I felt self-conscious. I noticed that every time I performed these tasks he rapped his knuckles on the table - as if reproaching me or demanding that I hurry up. As his guests went, I picked up my coat to leave myself. Lei Lei looked at me: 'What's the matter?' I almost cried. 'I am not your slave!'. \"'I need to tell you a story,' he said calmly. 'Hundreds of years ago there lived an emperor who was extremely good at chess. It seemed that no one was as good until one day a peasant was found who matched the emperor in ability, so the emperor could never get bored. There rose a small dilemma though, when both players would need to break for a meal or tea. If anyone dined with the emperor, no matter how informal the meal, they had to kowtow to him 100 times. This became extremely time consuming and irritating. So the emperor came up with the idea of the peasant placing his index finger and the one adjacent to it on the table and rapping - like rapping one's fingers on the table as if you were demanding something in a restaurant in an extremely rude way.' \"It transpired that by rapping on the table, Lei Lei was kowtowing to me 100 times. I never did discover the significance of my serving the rice and pouring the tea. But I have learned that however occasionally frustrating and confining it is to be with him I will never get bored.\""}, "isHosted": false}}}
