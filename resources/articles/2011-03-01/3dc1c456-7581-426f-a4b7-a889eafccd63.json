Craig's hero, David Rosenberg, is a blustering Edgware patriarch whose life and business are on the skids. His kosher catering firm has never recovered from the suspected death by poison of a client. Even more troubling to locals is the fact that his daughter, Ruth, is a lawyer for a UN inquiry into war crimes in Gaza; when Ruth returns home after the death of a brother killed fighting for the Israeli Defence Forces, it looks as if her presence at the funeral will cause angry protests. But, although Craig overloads the plot, his play keeps one engrossed; and that is largely because his hero combines something of the self-delusion of Miller's Willy Loman with the suppressed moral guilt of Joe Keller from All My Sons. It is also a role tailormade for Henry Goodman. He captures the genial, outward bullishness of a fundamentally weak man who pins his faith in the tribal loyalty of a community that has long since deserted him. And Laurie Sansom, who directed brilliantly the National's imports of Williams's Spring Storm and O'Neill's Beyond the Horizon from Northampton, once again shows his mastery of depicting fractured families. Susannah Wise as the implacably truth-seeking Ruth, Alex Waldmann as a surviving brother who only wants to get into internet gambling, and Tilly Tremayne as their distraught mother whose commitment to Israel is total, are all utterly persuasive. It's by no means a flawless play, but it has the vital ability to use a domestic drama as a means of embracing the wider international conflict."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
