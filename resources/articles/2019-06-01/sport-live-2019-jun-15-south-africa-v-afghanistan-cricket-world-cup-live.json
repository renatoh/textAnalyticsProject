Four more wins needed for that semi-final place. Eeek! Let\u2019s hope they can find some acceleration from somewhere, anywhere.... Afghanistan\u2019s batsmen fell at the hands of Imran Tahir, whose four for 29 wins him the man of the match award. Curtains for Afghanistan I\u2019m afraid. As many of the wise commentators have said in their emails, why aren\u2019t they getting more opportunities? This is THE feel-good story in cricket, the fairy-tale, the miracle. Anyway, that\u2019s it from me. The sky is blue in Manchester -at the moment. The Old Trafford gates open tomorrow at 8.30am. Good evening! Phehlukwayo nails it, twinkling his toes, with a huge six off Nabi over the sightscreen and beyond. Amla 41 not out, Phehlukwayo 17 not out 28th over: South Africa 124-1 (Amla 40, Phehlukwayo 11) Aftab comes back. Amla upper cuts a pedestrian ball which potters down to the third man fielder who potters after it. Aftab pulls out the bouncers, one of them is over head high and called wide. A super yorker nearly crushes Phehlukwayo\u2019s toes, he digs it out just in time. Another wide down the leg side. Let me just quickly file my nails. Amla 40 off 81 balls. 27th over: South Africa 118-1 (Amla 37, Phehlukwayo 10) Three off Nabi\u2019s over, including a big heave from Phehlukwayo. Six needed. Peter Rowntree writes: \u201cTotally agree with Romeo. Not just about Afghanistan but other cricketing developing nations. Problem is that to give a one-off game does little good, and with the mismatch against a full England side creates the same situation we have here. But for goodness sake, let us put out some Lion\u2019s sides and invite these countries to have a series of 4 day games here during our season.\u201d Super idea! 26th over: South Africa 118-1 (Amla 37, Phehlukwayo 10) Rashid again. First ball Phehlukwayo slog sweeps for four, then tries to reverse-sweep but misses, ah that\u2019s better, a cut for four. Just nine needed. 25th over: South Africa 108-1 (Amla 36, Phehlukwayo 1) I can tell South Africa a bedtime story about net run rate. It starts, \u201conce upon a time in 1999, England were eliminated in their own world cup by virtue of ...\u201dthe ending isn\u2019t pretty. As Nabi, smart in his blue pyjamas, bowls on. Amla pulls out his best forward defensive. Two from the over. 24th over: South Africa 106-1 (Amla 35, Phehlukwayo 0) Phehlukwayo has never batted above No.7 in the tournament... what tactics are these? Whatever they are, being thrown in against Rashid Khan isn\u2019t the easiest of situations. Amla squirts a single, Phehlukwayo bats out a couple of dots. 23rd over: South Africa 104-1 (Amla 34, Phehlukwayo 0) de Kock is furious with himself, that not out star was calling for him. Is Phehlukwayo coming out with instructions to up the tempo? In the USA, Anna hopes so: \u201cAt some point, maybe when the RRR went under 1.5, with Faf waiting in the wings, you\u2019d think South Africa would say \u201chell, let\u2019s slog it out now and get it over with\u201d. But no.Maybe they get paid by the hour?\u201d Just after bringing up the hundred partnership, de Kock whips Gulbadin off his toes and is well caught by Nabi at mid-wicket at hip height. 22nd over: South Africa 99-0 (Amla 33, de Kock 64) Nabi bowls, four off the over. And we\u2019ve got an \u201cI agree with Nick\u201d situation on our hands. Tone White writes: \u201c I don\u2019t know who \u201cRomeo\u201d is but I agree thoroughly with his assessment. That\u2019s all!\u201d Old King Cole too: \u201cI agree with Romeo! You\u2019ve got to give minnows a chance to cause an upset.\u201d 21st over: South Africa 95-0 (Amla 31, de Kock 63) Ok, here we go again. Can South Africa up that run-rate at the last? Gulbadin, squinting into the sun, is on the button again. Afghanistan not making this easy for South Africa. You wonder what they could have done had their batsmen managed to bat out the fifty overs in any of their games. Afghanistan\u2019s next two games are against England and India. 20th over: South Africa 91-0 (Amla 30, de Kock 60) Nabi keeps it tight till the fourth ball when Amla, feet firmly not dancing, hauls the ball over his shoulder for four. That be drinks, and any hope of a crazy wicket-tumble off, gone and far away. Amla might even play himself into form. 19th over: South Africa 86-0 (Amla 26, de Kock 59) At the River Taff end Gulbadin takes the ball from Rashid and says, \u201cI\u2019m the daddy.\u201d Four balls later he has his hands on his hips as de Kock pulls and the mid-wicket fielder, Rahmat Shah, loses all track of the ball and it wobbles over the rope. Things aren\u2019t going so well here for Afghanistan to be honest. 18th over: South Africa 80-0 (Amla 25, de Kock 54) A boundary! A boundary! Amla hauls that reverse-sweep out of the memory bank and dabs Nabi down to the rope. And breathe. South Africa hit cruise-control. 17th over: South Africa 73-0 (Amla 19, de Kock 53) And de Kock goes to his fifty, his second of the tournament, with a stunning thwack over mid-wicket off Rashid for four. His second boundary of the over. 16th over: South Africa 62-0 (Amla 19, de Kock 42) Ah Nabi, where have you been? Amla and de Kock are watchful, obvs. One off the over. In my inbox, Romeo\u2019s typewriter is hot with fury about the world cup in general and treatment of Afghanistan in particular. I think most people who know anything about world cricket and how it\u2019s run knew before all this started that India, England and Australia would be in the semi finals and then it would be luck/good performance on the day which decided it. The only bit of interest was always going to be who would be the fourth semi-finalists, and rather than South Africa, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka or West Indies it will be New Zealand. I don\u2019t include Afghanistan in that list as they have been marginalised because they are the \u2018other\u2019, more the \u2018other\u2019 than any of the \u2018others\u2019. And restricting the world cup to ten teams is pathetic. No jeopardy for India or England or Australia like this, none at all. At least two groups, better four, have Nepal, Ireland, Scotland, Netherlands or whoever qualifies. The qualifying tournament was much better sport than this, miles better. Since they became full members, only India, Ireland and Scotland have welcomed them. The South African commentators on this match are making fun of them. There is not a single Afghan commentator working in the TV coverage of the tournament. Every other country/team has at least one, and most have loads - and nearly all of them are either irritating, useless, narcissistic or just plain twats. Sometimes all of those. The ICC say you can get stuff in Hindi, Bengali and Urdu on their website but nothing in Pashto. The amount of patronising is shameful. 15th over: South Africa 62-0 (Amla 19, de Kock 42) On Sky, they point out how Rashid is at his best when the batsmen have to attack him. This they most definitely do not have to do today. Unless they suddenly have an attack of the run-rate collie-wobbles. \u201cPlaying with fear, playing for places,\u201d they say on TMS. Amla doesn\u2019t look too fearful to be honest, just rather prosaically out of touch. 14th over: South Africa 57-0 (Amla 19, de Kock 37) A punch and a pull, a pocketful of singles from Amla and de Kock. The current run-rate is 4.07, run rate required 2.06. 13th over: South Africa 53-0 (Amla 17, de Kock 35) Ah, it\u2019s lovely to watch Rashid Khan bowl, right-arm high, whirling, all that expectation in a single wrist. That said, eight comes from the over, including a leg-break cut down to the boundary by de Kock. And that\u2019s the South African fifty. It turns out they do know what they\u2019re doing after all. 11th over: South Africa 45-0 (Amla 16, de Kock 28) Gulbain runs in, is that a rather resigned look he has on that face? Tippety, tappety go the batsmen as the crowd bask, BASK, in the late afternoon sunshine. The Sky win predictor gives Afghanistan a generous one per cent chance. 11th over: South Africa 40-0 (Amla 15, de Kock 24) Rashid Khan again. de Kock is watchful. Our most loyal correspondent Abhijato Sensarma writes: I loved a term The Guardian contributer Geoff Lemon came up with alongside Mr Collins on a podcast during their daily match reviews. He said that if the Proteas lost another match, the only way they would qualify was if we witnessed an egalitarian tournament - \u201cA Lennon &amp; Trotsky World Cup\u201d, as he puts it! So far, just two \u2018mini-upsets\u2019 have really occurred, during Pakistan v England and Bangladesh v Proteas respectively... With both the assured results of today\u2019s matches not really doing much in changing the dynamic of the ground standings, we are indeed in need of a socialist cricketing revolution during the remainder of the tournament! You\u2019re right, in that the way this World Cup is going, we\u2019re going to end up with rather a lot of dead games at the end of the group stages. Which was not the plan at all. 10th over: South Africa 35-0 (Amla 14, de Kock 20) A double bowling change, as Gulbadin comes on. Then a terrible comedy bit of fielding on the boundary by Asghar turns a thick edge one and a bit into four. And at the end of the power play, South Africa have crept into second gear. 9th over: South Africa 30-0 (Amla 14, de Kock 15) Imran Tahir started with a wicket-taking googly, Rahid Khan starts with a short ball that de Kock eyes up then pulls it towards the deep mid-wicket boundary. He gets better, mixing up some googlies and keeping de Kock in the crease. 8th over: South Africa 25-0 (Amla 14, de Kock 10) Hassan again: dot, dot ,dot, then at last an Amla on-drive, green pads straight, bat perfectly balanced. Four. 7th over: South Africa 19-0 (Amla 9, de Kock 9) De Kock plays and misses at one from Aftab that nips off the seam. Then he loses altogether the next ball, only to look down in some confusion to find it down by his toes. If only Afghanistan had another hundred runs, darn it. What did I say? de Kock leans into a cover drive and sends it spinning to the boundary. 6th over: South Africa 15-0 (Amla 9, de Kock 5) Hassan, who has a look of Johnny Depp, is on target once again. Probing with enough bounce to get Amla on his tip toes. The crowd watch on quietly. A maiden! 5th over: South Africa 15-0 (Amla 9, de Kock 5) South Africa struggling to pierce the field, or perhaps they\u2019re not bothered about piercing the field. Caution has not always been their friend in the past. Anyway... a large appeal by Aftab against Amla - they review... I think this is more in hope than expectation to be honest...yes, its missing and Afghanistan have lost their review. 4th over: South Africa 11-0 (Amla 6, de Kock 4) Hassan is tight again and they trot through for three singles A correspondent wonders why there is no Afghan commentator on the sunset and vine rosta. Anyone know? We could do with the expertise really. 3rd over: South Africa 8-0 (Amla 5, de Kock 2) An inside edge no less from Amla off Aftab which goes down to fine leg for four. Amla sensing danger then shoulders arms, then shows us his best forward defensive. There are shadow on the pitch you hear, real shadows. 2nd over: South Africa 3-0 (Amla 1, de Kock 1) Hamid Hassan pulls on his headband and bustles in. Amla is watchful and more watchful and gets his first run with a dab down to third man. They scurry a quick single. And that\u2019s that. 1st over: South Africa 1-0 (Amla 0, de Kock 0) The medium pace of Aftab Alam to open and just a leg bye from the over. No fireworks yet to up the run--rate, but plenty of time for that, plenty of time. The players are in the middle, the sun is out: this shouldn\u2019t take long. Bottom of the table v second bottom of the table. Loser is out. The teams again: South Africa: Quinton de Kock (wk), Hashim Amla, Aiden Markram, Faf du Plessis (c), Rassie van der Dussen, David Miller, Andile Phehlukwayo, Chris Morris, Kagiso Rabada, Beuran Hendricks, Imran Tahir. Afghanistan: Hazratullah Zazai, Noor Ali Zadran, Rahmat Shah, Hashmatullah Shahidi, Mohammad Nabi, Gulbadin Naib, Asghar Afghan, Ikram Alikhil (wk), Rashid Khan, Aftab Alam, Hamid Hassan. The game will restart in about ten minutes, with South Africa needing 127 in a rain-adjusted 48 overs. They\u2019re peering at the pitch on Sky - it\u2019s looking good. Graeme Smith, whose dark blue suit is cut to impress, thinks South Africa should finish the game in 25 overs. Afghanistan, remember, were going ok, till they lost five for eight. Do write to me if you have a free moments at tanya.aldred.freelance@theguardian.com with any thoughts. An aside for those interested in tomorrow\u2019s India v Pakistan game: I write this from Manchester where it rained heavily this afternoon and was very squidgy underfoot in the nets at Old Trafford this morning. But it is currently dry and the sun is pretending to be just behind the next cloud. Hi everyone - what a crying shame that collapse was for Afghanistan, from a boring but smart-shoes respectable 69 for two at the rain break to a see-through trousers nightmarish 77 for 7. Some big hitting from Rashid Khan took them into three figures, but South Africa should knock that off quickly, will want to knock that off quickly to improve their hopeless run-rate. But they are in touching distance of ticking off one of the boxes in the five wins they need to get to the semi-finals. Afghanistan, I\u2019m afraid, are down and out. South Africa need 127 in 48 overs. Well after the second rain break Afghanistan\u2019s innings went distinctly raindrop-shaped, very quickly indeed. Tanya Aldred will take you through South Africa\u2019s run chase. All emails to her here, please. Bye! Hamid Hassan sends the first ball of Morris\u2019s over steepling into the skies, and Du Plessis eventually takes the catch only a couple of yards from the bat! 34th over: Afghanistan 125-9 (Hassan 0, Aftab 0) The ball was missing leg stump by a distance, and anyway that over had quite enough drama already. Rashid takes the fight to Tahir, with explosive results! The first two are swept to the rope, and the next two are chipped over coverish. Three boundaries and 14 runs from four balls, and he lifts the next to deep midwicket, where Van der Dussen takes a high catch - another foot higher and that was a six. \u201cThe ball before Rashid was out looked like a no-ball to me,\u201d writes Romeo. \u201cShould have been a free hit if it was.\u201d They think Aftab Alam is out lbw first ball, but the umpire disagrees. Du Plessis sends it upstairs. Rashid Khan has a bit of fun with Imran Tahir, thumping him all over the shop - and, eventually, straight to a fielder! 33rd over: Afghanistan 111-8 (Rashid 21, Hassan 0) Hamid Hassan has a wild swing at the last ball of the over, at perfect yorker length, completely misses it and the ball flies a couple of inches wide of off stump! Still, a wicket maiden from Morris. Morris, probably South Africa\u2019s best bowler today, comes back and he makes the breakthrough, bowling into the left-hander, who has to play and diverts it to first slip, where Amla holds a regulation catch! 32nd over: Afghanistan 111-7 (Ikram 9, Rashid 21) Imran Tahir continues, and both batsmen have a go at hitting down the ground, one high and one low. Both get singles. 31st over: Afghanistan 105-7 (Ikram 7, Rashid 17) Rabada starts with a short one, which Rashid deals with extremely unconvincingly but ultimately successfully, dead-batting it with one hand on the handle while looking in the other direction entirely. 30th over: Afghanistan 104-7 (Ikram 7, Rashid 16) Some minty-fresh preview action for you, if you would like some wider reading at this point: 29th over: Afghanistan 102-7 (Ikram 6, Rashid 15) Rabada gets a little overenthusiastic, with successive wides the result. Then Rashid hoists him back down the ground for a one-bounce four! Another fairly expensive over, which would have been even worse had Rashid actually connected with the wild roundhouse with which he attempted to launch the final delivery into the ether. 28th over: Afghanistan 95-7 (Ikram 5, Rashid 11) Bonus runs! Rashid tries to sweep, misses completely and the ball flicks off his hip and away for four leg byes. 27th over: Afghanistan 84-7 (Ikram 3, Rashid 10) Rabada returns as South Africa attempt to tie up the loose ends of Afghanistan\u2019s innings. The closest he gets is a fine inside edge from Rashid Khan, but the ball doesn\u2019t carry to De Kock and flies wide of him anyway. The previous ball had also gone to the rope, though that was a proper shot, driven past mid-off. 26th over: Afghanistan 78-7 (Ikram 2, Rashid 1) That ball was really travelling, which make\u2019s Markrab\u2019s grab all the sweeter. This has been a horrible crumble from Afghanistan, whose reaction to the game being reduced to 48 overs a side has been to ensure that neither will need even that many. Not a great delivery from Tahir, and Gulbadin leans back and tries to hoist it over midwicket. He fails, Markram plucking a great catch out of the sky! 25th over: Afghanistan 77-6 (Ikram 2, Gulbadin 5) Phehlukwayo v Ikram Alikhil seems to be a one-sided battle. The bowler\u2019s first three deliveries all whip just past the edge of the left-hander\u2019s bat, before Ikram finally gets off strike with a single to backward point. 24th over: Afghanistan 75-6 (Ikram 1, Gulbadin 4) Two wickets in Imran\u2019s last over; two runs in this one. 23rd over: Afghanistan 73-6 (Ikram 0, Gulbadin 3) After Nabi\u2019s dismissal Afghanistan had lost four wickets for one run in 10 deliveries and about five minutes of pure havoc. Afghanistan now really need this pair to dig in. Unpromisingly this is Ikram\u2019s fourth ODI innings; his top score so far is 5*. Another one! Nabi drags onto his stumps and this over starts with a wicket as well! 22nd over: Afghanistan 69-5 (Nabi 1, Ikram 0) What an introduction for Imran Tahir, who in no time at all sets off on two enthusiastic wide-armed celebratory sprints. The first wicket was just a gorgeous delivery, the second a leading edge that fell nicely in what became an extended follow-through. And another one! Afghanistan have lost three wickets for one run since the rain break, and perhaps the game has gone with them! Imran Tahir strikes with his first ball of the day, a googly that rips through the gate! 21st over: Afghanistan 69-3 (Noor Ali 32, Afghan 0) Asghar Afghan, the one change to Afghanistan\u2019s team today, is the new batsman, Phehlukwayo having restarted proceedings with a wicket maiden. South Africa strike in the first over after the break! An edge finally carries to the cordon, where Du Plessis makes no mistake! The players are back out and play has resumed, with Phehlukwayo back in action. Play will resume in 10 minutes, at 4.35pm BST. With the two rain delays a total of four overs have been lost, so each side will bat for just the 48 overs. I\u2019m told the covers are coming off in Cardiff, and that play should be back under way in short order. \u201cThis innings\u2019 syntax is a throwback to associate cricket matches - slow batting for the longest time, which one might sneer at when held in contrast to the high-scoring games played by the elite ODI nations,\u201d writes Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cIn reality, the more minor teams learn to play within themselves, and play the best way they realistically can. This is exactly what Afghanistan are doing now. With the likes of Nabi and Rashid batting down the order, late runs shouldn\u2019t be a worry. Batting out the 50 overs and getting anything above 260 is clearly their main priority now! Nabi and Rashid can wreak havoc with the ball too, after all...\u201d No news from Cardiff, I\u2019m afraid. My rain radar map suggests this might hang around for another half an hour or so. There\u2019s a bit of mizzle about, and the covers are coming back on! 20th over: Afghanistan 69-2 (Noor Ali 32, Hashmatullah 8) Du Plessis has so far given Rabada, Hendricks, Phehlukwayo and now Morris unbroken five-over spells. So we can presumably expect a couple more bowling changes pretty soon. Morris\u2019s fifth over follows the recent pattern, bringing a couple of singles and not a lot else. 19th over: Afghanistan 67-2 (Noor Ali 31, Hashmatullah 7) Still no wicket for Phehlukwayo, then, but another decent over for South Africa, just the single off it. Snicko shows a very slight edge, and the batsman is saved! You\u2019d have thought that he\u2019d have reviewed instantly if he was aware of the edge, rather than consulting Hashmatullah first, but whatever, it worked. The finger\u2019s up, and that looks dead on! The umpire\u2019s finger goes up, but Afghanistan go for another review. 18th over: Afghanistan 66-2 (Noor Ali 30, Hashmatullah 7) A single off the first ball of Morris\u2019s fourth over, and then five dots to finish. His first four overs have cost an average 2.75 apiece. Afghanistan are dawdling a little, and on course for an underwhelming 220. 17th over: Afghanistan 65-2 (Noor Ali 29, Hashmatullah 7) Phehlukwayo gives Hashmatullah some width, and it\u2019s cut away for four. The next is hit half-heartedly past cover for a couple, and that\u2019s drinks. Both teams will probably be reasonably, but not overwhelmingly, happy with their efforts so far. 16th over: Afghanistan 57-2 (Noor Ali 29, Hashmatullah 1) This is a lovely spell from Morris, who has offered absolutely no freebies and really bothered the batsmen. Afghanistan score three off the over though none of them are intentional, Hashmatullah trying to leave, failing and getting a single for it, and then Noor Ali edging for a couple to deep backward point. The ball would have clipped the stump, and that will very much do! Chris Morris thought so. The umpire thought so. Afghanistan hope not. There\u2019s a chance it might have been missing leg stump... 15th over: Afghanistan 56-1 (Noor Ali 27, Shah 6) Three overs into his spell, Phehlukwayo is yet to concede a boundary and is going at precisely 2.0 an over. There\u2019s another edge off the last, this one bouncing past slip and away for a couple. 14th over: Afghanistan 52-1 (Noor Ali 23, Shah 5) Morris is pushing and probing here, sending down little heat-seeking missiles programmed to locate the batsman\u2019s edge. They\u2019re just very slightly misprogrammed, keep narrowly avoiding the edge, and then Rahmat Shah clobbers the last over square leg for four. 13th over: Afghanistan 45-1 (Noor Ali 20, Shah 1) Noor Ali gets a single, one of two scoring shots in the last five overs. 12th over: Afghanistan 44-1 (Noor Ali 20, Shah 1) A double change, with Chris Morris having a go now. He bowls an excellent yorker, with Shah getting an edge to the ball before it clatters his pads, which is what saves him. And then he edges the last as well, but it doesn\u2019t carry to the keeper, who dives to his right but can\u2019t reach it, and is way short of Amla at first slip. 11th over: Afghanistan 44-1 (Noor Ali 20, Shah 1) South Africa make their first bowling change, and it\u2019s a drama-packed first over from Andile Phehlukwayo. First Shah goes for a sharp single, and Morris\u2019s shy at the stumps hits a divot in the turf and bounces wildly, way over the stumps! Then Noor Ali edges, it\u2019s gathered at second slip but the ball bounced a couple of inches before Du Plessis\u2019 hands! 10th over: Afghanistan 43-1 (Noor Ali 20, Shah 0) Shot! After four dots, Noor Ali cuts square away four, right off the sweet spot. Then the next gets a thick outside edge, but gets nowhere near reaching gully. 9th over: Afghanistan 39-1 (Noor Ali 16, Shah 0) Rahmat Shah negotiates the last four balls of the over without scoring, or for that matter trying to score. Rabada with the breakthrough! Hazratullah pulls, and Van der Dussen runs in from the deep to take a good low catch! 8th over: Afghanistan 39-0 (Hazratullah 22, Noor Ali 16) Hendricks continues, and his over starts with a loud appeal for LBW against Hazratullah, but the umpire isn\u2019t interested and neither is Faf du Plessis, the ball surely heading down the leg side. Then one comes off the gloves, but doesn\u2019t carry to the keeper. After three dots and a bit of dangers, Hazratullah clubs one through the covers for four. 7th over: Afghanistan 34-0 (Hazratullah 17, Noor Ali 16) Ripper! Rabada\u2019s short ball rears up past Noor Ali\u2019s chin, and then the next is fuller and on a lovely line, getting the batsman pushing again. 6th over: Afghanistan 33-0 (Hazratullah 16, Noor Ali 16) Hendricks completes his third over at no additional cost. Now it\u2019s actually sunny. The players are back out, and we\u2019ll get back under way very shortly. Happy news! The covers are coming off! The break allows me to see Isuru Udana execute two brilliant run-outs in three balls in today\u2019s other game. Follow it here: Apparently this rain is not expected to linger long, so this will be but a brief pause. For now, though, it is raining. 5.5 overs: Afghanistan 33-0 (Hazratullah 16, Noor Ali 16) What seems a pretty light rain starts to fall. Noor Ali hits the first past cover for four, and tickles the fifth fine for another, at which the umpires decide to take the players off. 5th over: Afghanistan 25-0 (Hazratullah 16, Noor Ali 8) Two very close shaves here! Noor Ali goes for a risky second, and gets away with it thanks to an enthusiastic throw back to De Kock, which forces him to collect with his right hand high in the air before throwing down the stumps, giving the batsman time to ground his bat. Then Hazratullah hits the last high over midwicket, and this time two fielders sprint backwards in chase. Morris dives, tries to catch but instead shovels it with his fingers further on towards the rope, and the other fails to prevent the four despite a decent dive. 4th over: Afghanistan 17-0 (Hazratullah 11, Noor Ali 5) \u201cI\u2019m getting it as well,\u201d says David in Tooting of the mysterious Sky voices, as Noor Ali spears the ball through cover for four. \u201cSounds like it\u2019s the director calling the shots and graphics, but it\u2019s slightly too low to be able to understand. Very frustrating, as I\u2019m sure it would be a refreshing alternative to the actual commentary for a change. A bit of a glimpse behind the curtain...\u201d That is clearly what it is. It sounds extremely full-on. 3rd over: Afghanistan 9-0 (Hazratullah 9, Noor Ali 0) Hazratullah gets a couple to backward square leg, and then hoists one over midwicket, safely clear of the field but it gets nowhere near the boundary, pretty much stopping as soon as it lands. 2nd over: Afghanistan 4-0 (Hazratullah 4, Noor Ali 0) Hendricks bowls across Noor Ali Zadran, who looks unhappy about it. He waves his bat at the third, which just passes the edge, and thereafter attempts little but survival. Maiden. 1st over: Afghanistan 4-0 (Hazratullah 4, Noor Ali 0) The first ball is a ripper, and nearly saws Hazratullah in half. Rabada can\u2019t keep that up, though - indeed he can\u2019t keep himself up, slipping in the process of sending down his second delivery and calling for some extra sawdust - and after five dots Hazratullah clips a full toss away for four. Anthems done, the opening batsmen head to the middle. Cricket incoming! The teams are out and ready to enjoy their anthems. \u201cSound yellow! Yellow! Sound!\u201d says the mysterious muffled Sky voice, as an ad break comes to an end. Today\u2019s teams in full: South Africa: Quinton de Kock (wk), Hashim Amla, Aiden Markram, Faf du Plessis (c), Rassie van der Dussen, David Miller, Andile Phehlukwayo, Chris Morris, Kagiso Rabada, Beuran Hendricks, Imran Tahir. Afghanistan: Hazratullah Zazai, Noor Ali Zadran, Rahmat Shah, Hashmatullah Shahidi, Mohammad Nabi, Gulbadin Naib, Asghar Afghan, Ikram Alikhil (wk), Rashid Khan, Aftab Alam, Hamid Hassan. Though I\u2019m also quite impressed by anyone who can hold four or more cricket balls in one hand. I still think the apples are one of the most impressive things about this World Cup. Is anyone else getting funny muffled bonus voices on their Sky coverage? I certainly am, and I\u2019m annoyed about it. There\u2019s plenty of green on the surface, and it\u2019s really quite windy. Kagiso Rabada will be liking what he\u2019s seeing, you\u2019d have thought. \u201cJust the nature of the week. The pitch has been under covers,\u201d says Faf du Plessis. The team is unchanged, so no Ngidi. \u201cThere was a bit of space for us to make a mistake here or there before, but now our backs are against the wall,\u201d says Faf du Plessis. That\u2019s about the shape of it. South Africa sit ninth in the 10-team table ahead of this game, against the only side below them, after three defeats and a washout in their first four (Afghanistan have played one game fewer). Any more slip-ups would render their last four fixtures, for them at least, irrelevant. \u201cWeek one was a bad start to the tournament but that\u2019s done now,\u201d Du Plessis continued. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to put all our energy and focus into the now and what\u2019s coming up next. I truly believe that if we carry those ghosts of the last week with us it\u2019s going to be tough to get out of the hole. But the conversations in the last couple of days, especially with all the rain around, has given me more time to make sure that the guys are on the right path.\u201d Even in this bloated, extended opening group stage it has not taken long for us to get what is in effect the tournament\u2019s first knockout game. Whoever loses this one is essentially doomed. South Africa\u2019s efforts to turn their tournament around could be assisted by the return of Lungi Ngidi, who has missed their last two games, but then again it might not be. \u201cIt\u2019s a tricky one with fast bowlers as to when they do come back,\u201d says Faf. \u201cWe\u2019re in a position now where we need to win five games out of five so you want your best available for selection. But if he\u2019s not 100%, or even 90%, in a shortened game with a bit of rain around is it worth the risk?\u201d It looks like we should get a full day\u2019s play in Cardiff, though some rain is forecast tonight. This could be considered the most important game of the World Cup so far. There should be fireworks. Welcome!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
