Talks have been ongoing for some time, with Tottenham demanding \u20ac20m from the outset and in the end the chairman, Daniel Levy, got what he wanted for a player who has been with the club since 2013 and had six months left on his contract. Inter offered \u20ac15m plus add-ons at the beginning of this week and, when the clubs met on Friday they struck a deal. The Dane has accepted a four-and-a-half-year contract worth a basic \u00a3260,000 a week that could rise to \u00a3320,000 with add-ons. Tottenham are in talks with Real Sociedad over the possible signing of Willian Jos\u00e9 but the clubs are \u00a311m apart in their valuation of the striker, with Spurs having offered roughly half of what the Spanish side want. Mourinho has identified the 28-year-old Brazilian as his main target and the player has told Sociedad he wants to leave. He has a release clause, believed to be \u20ac70m (\u00a358.8m), but Sociedad realise they are not going to get anywhere near that for a player with eight goals in 20 games in La Liga this season. Spurs have offered \u00a310m with Sociedad holding out for \u00a321m (\u20ac25m). Mourinho, meanwhile, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho has questioned the timing of Tottenham\u2019s winter break, saying it should be scheduled closer to their Champions League last-16 tie against RB Leipzig. Spurs will have a fortnight off between their matches with Manchester City on 2 February and at Aston Villa on 16 February. They play the Bundesliga leaders at home in the first leg on 19 February but Mourinho appeared to suggest his team should have been given a clear run of rest and training-ground work before that fixture. \u201cIt is what it is,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not happy that the break comes in the wrong moment. The break should be before the Champions League and, in the end, before the Champions League we don\u2019t have the break. We have to play Aston Villa on the Sunday, playing [RB Leipzig] two days later [sic]. So we don\u2019t really care about the break, honestly.\u201d Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea will also play league fixtures the weekend before their Champions League ties. Should Spurs draw Saturday\u2019s FA Cup fourth-round tie at Southampton they are likely to face a replay on 5 February that would, in any case, shorten their break significantly but Mourinho said that inconvenience would not affect their attitude towards the game. \u201cIf we have to play Southampton in a second match, it means we are still alive in the competition and it\u2019s better than losing,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course if we can choose, the result we are going to try and get is to win the match.\u201d Tottenham lost 1-0 at St Mary\u2019s in the Premier League on New Year\u2019s Day, a particularly damaging afternoon\u2019s work given Harry Kane limped off with the hamstring injury that keeps him out until at least April. Mourinho described Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s side as \u201cgood, really good\u201d but made a point of observing their most recent match against Crystal Palace on Tuesday, whereas Spurs were in action against Norwich on Wednesday. He also observed that his team had been hard done by in that meeting three and a half weeks ago \u2013 echoing his comment after the Norwich game that \u201cnormally players and teams that play against us \u2026 are all lucky\u201d. \u201cWhat do I expect? First of all I expect a team 24 hours fresher than another, because they have 24 hours\u2019 advantage in relation to that,\u201d he said. \u201cA team with big self-esteem, big confidence and again very difficult to play against. \u201cWhat did we learn there? We learned that it\u2019s hard and it\u2019s going to be hard. Again, there we were a bit unlucky and Southampton were a bit lucky. The Harry Kane [disallowed] goal, other decisions, injury to Harry, injury to [Tanguy] Ndombele at the beginning of the game. We have to fight against so many things we cannot control.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
