Here, in the tradition of such greats as Schwarzkopf, Wunderlich and Herman Prey, they team up for an adventure in the tuneful world of operetta, as symbolised by the delightful title track from Lehar's 'The Land of Smiles'. There's more Lehar, of course, alongside lush lollipops from Kalman, Mill\u00f6cker, Strauss and Supp\u00e9. Anthony Holden Mozart/Britten/Dohn\u00e1nyi Chamber music Fran\u00e7ois Leleux (oboe), Lisa Batiashvili (violin), Lawrence Power (viola), Sebastian Klinger (cello) (Sony Classical 88697285852) \u00a312.99 This adroit teaming of first-rate chamber musicians, led by husband and wife Fran\u00e7ois Leleux and Lisa Batiashvili, makes for an exceptional disc which brims with treats, such as an elegant Mozart oboe quartet K370 and a beautifully realised, dark and creamy adagio K580a. Altogether more effervescent is their account of Britten's 'Phantasy Quartet', written when he was just 19 but already displaying precocious promise, and Ernst Von Dohn\u00e1nyi's five-movement 'Serenade for String Trio Op 10'. Highly recommended. Stephen Pritchard Britten Britten Abroad Susan Gritton (soprano), Mark Padmore (tenor), Iain Burnside (piano) (Signum SIGCD122) \u00a310.99 The two suitcases on the cover make the point: the fluency and volume of Benjamin Britten's vocal works in his native tongue, English, obscure the fact that some of his finest settings were of foreign poetry. Under the title 'Britten Abroad', those fine soloists Susan Gritton and Mark Padmore explore Britten's works in German, Latin, Italian and Russian, notably the 'Seven Sonnets' of Michelangelo, 'Four French Folksong Arrangements' and 'Um Mitternacht' to words by Goethe. Dating from 1940 to 1965, these works certainly merit this stylish revival. Anthony Holden"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
