To reward us she's opened two Otarian restaurants, serving delicious vegetarian fast food with the smallest carbon footprint available, in London's West End (she already has two in the US). It's a tasty way to approach carbon accounting \u2013 perhaps one of the hardest sells in green living. \"Replacing a disease-inducing meal\" \u2013 read, one with meat \u2013 \"with a sustainable option saves a person 2.4kg of CO2. That's 20% of their consumption for the day and about half of their food CO2 emissions,\" she says firmly. Carbon-saving combos including a burger or tacos, a small water and a \"ChocO Treat\" at \u00a38.95, with an average saving of 1.7kg CO2. \"This really is a small and inexpensive way to make a difference,\" says Oswal. But we're still not talking McDonalds' prices. \"These are not McDonalds' ingredients,\" she retorts. Every ingredient is, she stresses, painstakingly procured for the lowest footprint and that doesn't necessarily mean local or organic because \"footprinting throws up some surprises\" \u2013 a stance that may ruffle a few traditional green feathers. Vegetarianism is a moral imperative for Oswal, but does its ecological superiority really stack up? There is, after all, contention over the extent of emissions livestock production is responsible for. \"With vegetarian food the impact is greatly reduced and even at the lower estimates livestock emissions account for one fifth of the global emissions problem. It's high time this got one fifth of the attention.\" Otarian, 190 Shaftesbury Avenue, London WC2 and 181 Wardour Street, London W1 (otarian.com)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
