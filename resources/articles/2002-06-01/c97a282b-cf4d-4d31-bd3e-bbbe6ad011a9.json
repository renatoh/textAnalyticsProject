Hungry to entertain the Bath Festival supporters, no. The field was soggy after a wet week but the conditions had not prevented the early-morning football kick-about. Cricket, though, was too dangerous until mid-afternoon. \"We'd be playing by now at Taunton,\" said the Somerset chief executive Peter Anderson, tapping another nail in the coffin of festival cricket. When play started Richard Johnson, in his first game since the opening round of the championship after knee and hamstring injuries, soon persuaded Derek Kenway to snick to slip. Will Kendall and Giles White then settled down to some sensible batting. Kendall greeted Simon Francis with three fours in his first over. When he returned Francis tempted White into nicking to slip and then seamed a low ball into Robin Smith's off stump. Kendall, unbeaten on 70, and Neil Johnson, 31, resisted to the close. A cloudy day, however, was brightened by the presence of Mark Lathwell. This marvellously uncomplicated batsman retired in the spring, seeing he had no regular place in Somerset's plans. One of his last great innings was here a year ago against Yorkshire, a brutal and undefeated 98 before lunch. He was an entertainer, a role that yesterday's teams seemed reluctant to play."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
