The former Harvard law professor\u2019s policy heavy approach made an impression among activists at the She the People forum in Texas last month and was well-received at the California state party convention earlier this month. This week a Morning Consult poll saw Warren break into the double digits at 10%, putting her in third place behind Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden. A recent Economist/YouGov poll found Warren was making gains among liberal voters, with Democrats considering the Massachusetts senator for the Democratic presidential nomination in nearly equal measure with Sanders. Her intense campaigning on a vast swathe of specific issues has achieved viral moments on the internet \u2013 even including one woman whom Warren advised on her love life \u2013 as well as playing well during recent television events. At a televised town hall in Indiana this week, Warren listened intently as a woman who voted for Trump in 2016 described her disillusionment \u2013 not only with a president who failed to bring back manufacturing jobs as he said he promised but with an entire political system stymied by dysfunction. \u201cI feel duped,\u201d said the voter, Renee Elliott, who was laid off from her job at the Indianapolis Carrier plant. \u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of faith in political candidates much anymore. They make promises. They make them and break them.\u201d Warren rose to her feet. \u201cThe thing is, you can\u2019t just wave your arms,\u201d the she said, gesturing energetically. \u201cYou\u2019ve really got to have a plan \u2013 and I do have a plan.\u201d That mantra \u2013 a nod to the steady churn of policy blueprints Warren\u2019s campaign has released \u2013 has become a rallying cry for Warren as she edges her way to the top of the crowded Democratic presidential primary field. But despite the burst of momentum, Warren\u2019s path to the nomination has two major roadblocks: Sanders and Biden. Her success will depend on whether she can deliver a one-two punch: replacing Sanders as the progressive standard bearer while building a coalition broad enough to rival Biden. Warren began that work this week with a multi-stop tour of the midwest designed to show her strength among working class voters who supported Trump. Ahead of the visit, Warren unveiled a plan she described as \u201ceconomic patriotism\u201d, which earned startling praise from one of Trump\u2019s most loyal supporters. \u201cShe sounds like Donald Trump at his best,\u201d conservative Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson told his largely Republican audience as he read from Warren\u2019s proposal during the opening monologue of his show this week. The plan calls for \u201caggressive intervention on behalf of American workers\u201d to boost the economy and create new jobs, including a $2tn investment in federal funding in clean energy programs. His praise was all the more surprising because Warren has vowed not to participate in town halls on Fox News, calling the network a \u201chate-for-profit racket that gives a megaphone to racists and conspiracists\u201d. The debate over whether Democrats should appear on Fox News for a town hall has divided the field. Sanders, whose televised Fox News town hall generated the highest viewership of any such event, argued that it is important to speak to the network\u2019s massive and heavily Republican audience. As Warren courts working-class voters in the midwest, she continues to focus heavily on the early states of Iowa and New Hampshire. After jumping into the race on New Year\u2019s Eve 2018, Warren immediately set to work, scooping up talent and building a massive operation in Iowa. Her campaign is betting a strong showing in the first in the nation caucuses will propel her in New Hampshire, which neighbors Massachusetts, and then boost her in Nevada and South Carolina. But as Warren gains momentum, moderate candidates are becoming more vocal about their concern that choosing a nominee from the party\u2019s populist wing will hand Trump the election. \u201cIf we want to beat Donald Trump and achieve big progressive goals, socialism is not the answer,\u201d former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper told Democrats in California last weekend. Though his comments were met with boos and jeers among the convention\u2019s liberal crowd, his warning is at the heart of the debate over who should be the Democratic presidential nominee. Warren has pointedly distinguished herself as a capitalist as opposed to a socialist or a democratic socialist, but she has not backed away from a populist platform that embraces sweeping economic reforms. In her address to the California Democratic party, Warren rejected appeals for moderation. \u201cSome say if we all calm down, the Republicans will come to their senses,\u201d she said. \u201cBut our country is in a time of crisis. The time for small ideas is over.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
