We saw this coming today.\" Typically, despite the splendid performance which kept Wolves in sixth place, Jones refused to go overboard. \"If we won 1-0 I'd feel just as happy,\" he insisted. A \"shell-shocked\" Gillingham manager Andy Hessenthaler, whose team now have little chance of anything but a mid-table finish, conceded: \"We played particularly badly. But Wolves are a splendid team and I'm sure they will do well in the play-offs.\" Miller and his front-line partner Nathan Blake tricked and teased the visiting defence all afternoon. Miller scored twice and Blake once but each could easily have claimed a hat-trick. Blake got the first in the 16th minute and the lead was doubled by Colin Cameron moments later. With Gillingham beaten for agility and creativity it became a matter of how many Wolves could score. It was five by half-time with Miller netting one and Mark Kennedy two before Miller completed the scoring three minutes into the second half. Man of the match: Kenny Miller (Wolves)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
