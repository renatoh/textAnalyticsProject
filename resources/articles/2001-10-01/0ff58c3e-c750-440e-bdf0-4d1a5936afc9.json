Who cares? He is just one more grey man in a cabinet where many grey men could be reshuffled into oblivion tomorrow and they'd be lucky to feature as a future pub quiz question. With no popular base, they owe their position only to their leader. Colourless, they have a managerial vision of politics, loyal to the CEO, delivering What Works in their departments as measured by No 10. They do not speak in cabinet, they raise no questions, they rubber stamp. Poor Stephen Byers has become the archetype for these useful no-boo-to-a-goose men, all such dismal performers in public, unable to champion a cause. Once in trouble there is no one to come to their rescue, no friend to call journalists to say what a good bloke he is, how full of conviction, what wonders he has wrought behind the scenes. It explains why he is in trouble, despite doing entirely the right thing over Railtrack. Today's revelations in the Guardian could hardly come at a worse moment. He is caught in a breathtaking economy with the truth over London Underground. Worse, he is caught participating in Gordon Brown's petulant wish to starve the tube of funds this year, so that next year, once the PPP begins, it will look miraculously better. When it was thought the tube PPP would be up and running this year, the Treasury promised \u00a3775m - the enormous new sum the tube is to be guaranteed in perpetuity. Had this much (it will rise to \u00a31bn a year) ever been guaranteed before, it would have transformed the tube under any management in the last 50 years. At present the Northern line runs 19 trains an hour, when it can run one a minute: it ran 40 an hour in 1912. (Apologies to non-Londoners, but at least there are 10 times more Londoners than there are farmers.) The tube always suffered stop-go and stop-stop funding in tight years. But this was no tight year. This is mega-spend year when most departments will fail to spend all their allocations. London Underground set out to spend what it was promised in November, signed contracts, drew up plans, employed people, set about new work only to have it savagely cut back in May without notice. A transport secretary is there to root for transport, not to fall in with childish Treasury games - and certainly not to mislead by issuing a press release claiming funding had doubled. It was not a lie, but a technical nicety. With London Underground losing \u00a3300m a year, the \"increase\" was only running to stand still. Its finance director says in his letter this cut meant no progress on the previous year, leaving an untouched backlog of \u00a31.2bn in necessary maintenance. True, Byers had not been in the job long, but \"doubled\" was less than honest. Byers's people say he arrived at transport determined to re-examine both Railtrack and the tube. As Railtrack hit the buffers, he jumped and made the right decision. In the Commons on Monday he echoed what so many have said - and he said it well. \"This was a company in crisis. On the one hand coming with a begging bowl for taxpayers' money month after month and on the other, handing out dividends to shareholders,\" he said. \"I do not believe the government is here to fund shareholders of private companies.\" So now he must apply those words to the tube. What is the difference? The Treasury claims the structure of the tube PPP is quite different to the rail calamity. Indeed its enormously complex 30-year contracts are no doubt better. But the fundamental problem Byers spelled out remains exactly the same: why should the state pour subsidy into private companies that leaks out into shareholders' pockets? To add to the government's embarrassment, the relatively simple privatisation of National Air Traffic Services (NATS) may be falling out of the sky. After just three months, the government may have to step in and take over 51% ownership because airlines in trouble cannot pay their share. As ever, the government must always take responsibility. There is never a genuine transfer of financial risk to the private sector on essential national facilities. Although noisily opposed, NATS was a reasonable privatisation because there was no government subsidy. What Railtrack shows - and Stephen Byers spelled out - is the impossibility of privatising anything that needs permanent subsidy. How much taxpayer money should fetch up with the shareholder will always be shrouded in obscurity. What is a subsidised profit? The City has tried to do its worst to Byers in the last few days, harrumphing away at \"nationalisation without compensation\" and similar nonsense. Railtrack was double-bust long ago. As ever, a few humble shareholders are put forward for newspaper tears in a disgraceful attempt to get the taxpayer to foot a City gambling bill. Shareholders have had \u00a3700m out of Railtrack already, money that should have gone on rails. And \u00a31bn a year in profits has been taken out by the whole railway system. When banks rattle the government's cage, everyone quakes, yet this is empty City indignation. Talking to some companies set to take over the tube, they describe how they hurried to check their banks were still up for the tube PPP despite the Railtrack bankruptcy: yes, they were assured, the money is still there, for there is no better deal in town than PFI and PPP. Stockbrokers are extolling buoyant shares in the PFI/PPP business. Here is HSBC's advice to clients to buy Balfour Beatty (a big tube investor). \"It is the rapidly expanding PFI business that has caught investors' interest...\" - and no wonder, with a 35% return guaranteed and no risk. Stephen Byers thought Railtrack was a Good News announcement - and so it was (though his misplaced loyalty to Jo Moore was a bad mistake that blew it away). Turning Railtrack into a not-for-profit trust is the right model. It is also the model that Bob Kiley, commissioner of transport for London, has tirelessly promoted for the tube. If it is right for Railtrack, why not for the tube? This argument has wasted too many lost years for the Treasury to change its mind. \"It would take too long to start again,\" transport officials say. But if the government handed over the tube tomorrow to Kiley, together with the agreed subsidy in full, major improvement would begin at once, even if a new contracting round by a new trust would take longer. Here is Stephen Byers's big chance. So why not put his foot down? Threaten resignation if need be, make an issue of it, make it work. The prime minister himself tried to make it happen, but in the end even he dared not face Gordon Brown down on this. A public trust for Railtrack must mean a trust for the tube too. For Byers, rebellion of the grey man in a very popular cause would breathe fresh life into a cabinet too obedient for the government's own good. p.toynbee@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
