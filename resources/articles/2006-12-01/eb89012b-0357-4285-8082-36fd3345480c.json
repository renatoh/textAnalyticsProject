Amid the details of the carol concert and holiday dates was a paragraph that gave me pause. It suggested that children would perform and behave better in school if their parents instituted a television ban in the evenings. I rang my mother, who is a primary school teacher. \"Have you ever considered trying to ban evening television?\" I inquired. She responded with the sort of analysis that takes Ofcom several months and a couple of hundred thousand pounds: TV sets in bedrooms lead to kids staying up too late watching unsupervised and unsuitable programmes after the watershed, resulting in bad behaviour and poor concentration in school the next day. So far, so much common sense. But my eldest's classmates are four years old; the head teacher is not talking about banning soaps and post-watershed cop shows. She means Nickelodeon, CBeebies, Milkshake and the like. I have a few problems with this, most too lengthy to go into without turning into Richard Littlejohn. Mainly though, the problem is that most children's TV is extremely good. For those of you who can't remember or haven't got kids, let me reassure you: the quality is on balance higher - and given the volume, amazingly so - than when we were young. Every day on Nick Jr or CBeebies you can see well thought out, well-intentioned and well-made programmes aimed at very young children. They are fantastically targeted, developmentally appropriate and lovingly crafted. Frankly, most of it beats adult TV hands down. A specific example: Charlie and Lola, a Tiger Aspect production for CBeebies. Based on the fabulous books by Lauren Child, this series was a word-of-mouth hit in the playground before it had even launched. It is moral, thoughtful, funny and incredibly endearing. They are stylish and crafted books turned into similarly stylish and crafted films. It is, in short, a triumph. There are exceptions. I don't want to point out specific kids' shows made cynically for the bucks, but they're easy to spot. Often they are digitally produced, animated versions of classic children's characters. These have no soul, no inventiveness and precious little wit. They feel like they've been scripted by a computer as well as drawn that way. But a world that contains Fifi, Lola, Storymakers, Harry and his Bucketful of Dinosaurs and Dora the Explorer is a kind, imaginative and fun place. It is not violent, disrespectful or even cheap and nasty. The quality of these programmes is the main reason why the junk food ad ban is not as threatening to children's television as we've all been led to believe. For a start, kids' shows have the huge financial bonus of being able to flog almost anything you can think of with a logo attached. Elaborate playsets, backpacks, flasks and lunch boxes, books, umbrellas, pens, stickers, plush toys, action figures, clothing. A hit show can print money until the next thing comes along and even then it can carry on shifting stock to the next generation. They're still flogging new improved Teletubbies toys to babies even though the show itself is eight years old. I understand that for appearance's sake if nothing else, children's channels must protest vehemently to Ofcom that banning burger ads will destroy their business. I sympathise - it's never nice to have income you've grown accustomed to taken away. But let's not kid ourselves - the ad revenue is surplus to requirements. These programmes should be so subsidised by the ancillary rights holders, the channels should be paid to air them. In the US, they sometimes are. Put it another way - MTV and its imitators make fantastic financial sense because their content is free to the broadcasters. Music videos are ads and the record companies produce them at great cost and with great care in order to flog the music. Children's channels ought to work on the same model. Viacom should no more be paying to produce Nick Jr programmes than it should Robbie Williams' latest offering. This is great television economics. Let those of us with less willpower than sense fall victim to pester power and subsidise great telly. With the honourable exception of the BBC producing the less marketable stuff (news, Blue Peter, Jackanory), the market will suffice. And that's because of a brilliant truth that each generation realises anew - kids respond better to better programmes. Proof? I've never been asked to buy a Noddy anything."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
