With intent removed from the equation, referees have no latitude if a player\u2019s arms are not in a \u201cnatural position\u201d \u2013 at their side or behind their back \u2013 and the appeal for teams to use this zero-tolerance policy to play for a penalty looks to be a potential consequence. \u201cWe had a VAR meeting with Fifa referees before the game,\u201d said Kirby, whose cross hit Scotland\u2019s Nicola Docherty on the hand to earn England a penalty scored by Nikita Parris early in their 2-1 win in Nice on Sunday. \u201cThe referees were very clear that if your arms are not in a natural position or near your body then a penalty is going to be given. But I would like to think I\u2019m not going to drive down the line then kick the ball against an opponent\u2019s hand or arm because I want to get a penalty. \u201cI\u2019d like to think that\u2019s how others feel in that moment but possibly it could happen. I don\u2019t feel that in that split second, you\u2019re thinking: \u2018I\u2019m going to cross it and hit her hand.\u2019 I\u2019m thinking: \u2018Lucy Bronze is in the box and I want it to hit her head.\u2019 My cross was intended to get on the head of one of our players so she might score.\u201d Kirby did not appeal for the penalty and the referee missed the incident, only to award the spot-kick after being advised to watch a replay by the VAR official. The Chelsea playmaker was adhering to an instruction from Phil Neville that his players do not contest refereeing decisions and treat all officials with respect. \u201cNo one really appealed for that penalty and I just thought: \u2018It\u2019s not going to get given,\u2019\u201d Kirby said. \u201cBut when it went to VAR I knew it would be given, so I used the time to tell Nikita: \u2018Make sure you\u2019re ready.\u2019 I was able to have a conversation to prepare her, knowing she\u2019d be stepping up. A few of the girls didn\u2019t know what was going on but I did and I got Nikita composed.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
