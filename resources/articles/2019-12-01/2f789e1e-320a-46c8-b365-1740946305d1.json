After a presentation at the Euro 2020 draw in Bucharest, Noel Mooney was quoted by the Times as saying: \u201cThe feasibility study is positive and there\u2019s a sense the right thing to do is go forward. This bid is out on the front foot and very well led by the English FA, who gave a very strong presentation. It\u2019s a chance to get a really credible bid and hopefully win it. I\u2019d be very surprised if there\u2019s not a very credible bid from Great Britain and Ireland.\u201d In August last year a joint home nations bid for the 2030 World Cup was given full backing by Uefa\u2019s president, Aleksander Ceferin, who said it was \u201cabout time\u201d the tournament returned to England for the first time since 1966. Such a full and public endorsement of a possible bid by Ceferin, the most powerful man in international football in Europe, was a huge boost. \u201cI think it would be a very wise idea,\u201d he said last year. \u201cThe infrastructure in the UK is very good and in a way if more countries bid there is more chance to win. I think after all these years it\u2019s time for that part of Europe to get the World Cup. I don\u2019t doubt the quality of the bid.\u201d Qatar will host the 2022 World Cup and Canada, the United States and Mexico are joint-hosts for 2026, which will be a 48-team tournament."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
