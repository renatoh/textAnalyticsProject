Financial services firms are planning layoffs - the first time for more than a year that they have predicted lower employment levels in their responses to the CBI's quarterly sector barometer. \"The global slowdown seems to have affected sentiment in the financial services sector, despite continued growth in volumes,\" said Douglas Godden, the CBI's head of economic policy. With stocks firmly in the grip of a bear market, the loss of confidence was sharpest among those firms linked to the equities sector, such as securities traders and fund managers, the CBI said. Firms have already started tightening their belts, instructing staff to take public transport and to limit their entertainment bills. But with tough competitive conditions sqeezing fees, the cost cutting measures instituted so far have yet to improve profitability. \"It's not surprising that employment prospects are weakening,\" said Mr Godden. A recent survey suggested that up to 20,000 jobs could be lost in the financial services industry this year. Meanwhile, inflationary pressures in the economy are easing, according to official figures released yesterday, raising hopes that the Bank of England will sanction another reduction to borrowing costs next month. The price of goods leaving the factory gate rose by just 0.8% in the year to March, according to the office for national statistics, the weakest increase for two years. Producer price inflation has declined steeply since its peak of 2.8% four months ago. \"The underlying picture is one of rapidly weakening price pressure in manufacturing,\" said Jonathan Loynes, chief UK economist at Capital Economics.But consumers defied the growing economic gloom, causing retail sales to rise during March by 7%, the British Retail Consortium reported."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
