While Kyle Walker featured in one of the Sunday papers and was forced to issue \u201ca public apology for the choices I made last week\u201d, the Burnley manager was in another making no apologies whatsoever for using his enforced down time to reacquaint himself with his family, free up extra room in his wine cellar by working his way through the contents and perform assorted outdoor chores that seem to involve power-hosing anything in view. \u201c\u2018I\u2019m doing things I don\u2019t get the chance to normally do,\u201d he said. \u201cTidying up the garage, jet washing. Needless to say I\u2019m jet washing just about everything I can find. If it stays somewhere for too long it gets jet washed! There are things I miss of course like having a curry or a pint down at the pub. I\u2019ve done a lot of home cooking. We also go out on our bikes, out for walks as a family, maintaining our fitness and keeping stimulated.\u201d Dyche has also been keeping stimulated by brushing up on his IT skills, having got his son, Max, to teach him how to use Zoom so he can have virtual meetings with his coaching staff in an effort to ensure Chris Wood and Ashley Barnes remain as svelte as possible ahead of ... whatever happens next. \u201cThere are non-stop support lines for players and staff. Dietary advice, psychological support if needed. We\u2019re trying to keep as many bases covered as we can.\u201d This morning, Dyche put down his power hose for long enough to shoot the breeze with Talksport, adding his two cents to the national debate over how much money Premier League players should be paid and how they should spend it. Over the weekend, health secretary Matt Hancock doubled down on his demand that top-flight footballers do more to help those less fortunate but like many others, Dyche suggested the MP should keep his neb out of affairs that are none of his concern. \u201cI can only presume he was immediately ill informed,\u201d said Dyche of the Tory hypocrite. \u201cI can\u2019t talk about other businesses, I can only speak about the football industry because I have been in it all of my life. I have seen footballers do so many good things, so many things financially, so many things with time, care effort and attention. It is such a massive generalisation for Mr Hancock to throw that in. I can only hope he was ill informed and over the weekend a bit of balance has been brought in.\u201d The Fiver would like to commend the Burnley manager\u2019s breezy optimism at this very difficult time. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cThe UAE Football Association has terminated the contract of Ivan Jovanovic and his team of assistants, thanking him for his efforts and wishing him success\u201d \u2013 the UAE FA wave goodbye to their Serbian coach of five months despite an enviable unbeaten record of P0 W0 D0 L0 F0 A0. FIVER LETTERS \u201cMy least favourite game (Friday\u2019s Fiver letters)? Took my then-eight-year-old son down to St Andrew\u2019s, and bought him his first shirt with his name and No 8 proudly on the back (his age and Trevor Francis\u2019 shirt number). The opponents? Bournemouth, who won 8-0. He is scarred for life but still we go\u201d \u2013 Chris Sampson. \u201cImagine the excitement of the new season for Norwich City (and fans) in August 2009, having just dropped down to League One. A relatively new manager in Bryan Gunn, a fantastic new recruit in flamin\u2019 Aussie keeper Michael Theoklitos and a home game against Colchester. Five-nil down at half-time and the end result of a 7-1 loss led to fan angst and some some quick personnel changes. Keeper on the bench and Gunn replaced by Colchester manager Paul Lambert, who went on to take the Yellows up and up again. Of course Lambert went on to much greater things in a stellar managerial career. What? Oh\u201d \u2013 Terry Banfield. \u201cI travelled to the 2008 Big Cup final as a Chelsea fan. On arrival, my dad, brother and I entered the outdoor fanzone only to realise we hadn\u2019t changed up any roubles but were told if we left we would not be allowed back in. It was 8am. So we went around 18 hours in the rain without shelter, food or water, taking in 120 minutes plus a shootout to reach the worst outcome possible, via being the width of a post from the best result in our history. We were then locked in a sweltering minibus before encountering a \u2018first come, first served\u2019 policy at the airport and eventually arrived back at Gatwick sometime the next day. The kicker: I was living in Germany at the time and could only get a visa from the club, so my journey read: Berlin-London-Moscow-London-Berlin, for the cost of a cool grand\u201d \u2013 Stuart Robinson. \u201cMy local team is the Colorado Rapids of MLS. I do not have least favourite games, I have least favourite seasons\u201d \u2013 Todd Warnke. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Stuart Robinson. NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Pep Guardiola\u2019s mother has died at the age of 82 after contracting coronavirus. Gareth Southgate and David Moyes have taken 30% pay cuts from the English FA and West Ham respectively, to follow Graham Potter and Eddie Howe making similar gestures last week. Luke Shaw reckons the Premier League season should be scrapped if it can\u2019t be finished. \u201cScrap it and start again. Start it again,\u201d he cheered. DAZN, the streaming company that has the rights to the Premier League in Brazil, Canada, Japan and Spain, is in negotiations to halt payments until there is clarity on when and how the season can be completed. Cheltenham players have shaved their heads to suedehead lengths to raise money to buy a ventilator for the local hospital. Bayern Munich\u2019s players returned to training on Monday, but only in small groups. \u201cIt goes without saying that all hygiene regulations will be strictly observed,\u201d said a club statement. STILL WANT MORE? Premier League players and pay cuts: Paul MacInnes answers the key questions. My favourite game: 100% Blade John Ashdown recalls Sheffield United\u2019s rollercoaster 2003 play-off triumph over Nottingham Forest. What would Bill Shankly do? Not what Liverpool are doing with their furloughing of non-playing staff, says Sean Ingle. Reading the game: our writers pick their favourite football titles.
