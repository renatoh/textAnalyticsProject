Gladys Lewis, 74, from Pentre in south Wales, died at the Royal Glamorgan hospital on 29 October. Her son Dean Lewis, 44, was found unresponsive at his home in nearby Treorchy the next day and pronounced dead a short time later. His younger brother Darren, 42, died at the same hospital as his mother on Monday. All three had tested positive for coronavirus before they died and their death certificates state Covid-19 as the cause. After news of the family\u2019s tragedy was published online, however, some social media users refused to accept they had died of coronavirus. There were also comments asking what underlying health conditions they had, and some suggested their diet and lifestyle had been a factor in their deaths. Dean\u2019s wife, Claire Lewis, told Channel 4 News that people who think Covid is a conspiracy need to \u201cwise up\u201d. \u201cThe comments we have seen I try to blank out as much as possible because people are cruel,\u201d she said. \u201cThere have been some amazing comments where people have given us support and even strangers have said how heartfelt they are. But for the people who are trolling, I just feel sorry for you because I hope it doesn\u2019t happen to you.\u201d David Lewis, Gladys\u2019s husband of 44 years, echoed Claire\u2019s comments. He urged people to \u201cbelieve this is real\u201d and said that \u201cif they lose what we\u2019ve lost, then they will suffer\u201d. David described his wife as a wonderful woman who was a devoted mother, grandmother of 13 and great-grandmother of four. Asked about Dean and Darren, David said: \u201cWhat can a father say when he\u2019s lost two sons? I love them so much. It\u2019s devastating. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to get through it.\u201d His daughter, Debbie Mountjoy, said the comments on social media broke their hearts: \u201cI just hope none of them have to go through anything like what we and hundreds and thousands of other families have had to go through with Covid-19. \u201cThey want to spend a couple of minutes with me, my dad, Claire, Claire\u2019s children and my children to see the devastation that we are going through as a family. Spend five minutes with us and they\u2019ll know it\u2019s real.\u201d Debbie described Gladys as \u201cthe best mother and grandmother anyone could ask for\u201d, and Claire said her husband had had a heart of gold and adored his family. Darren was \u201cthe most lovable, happy man\u201d, the family said. The family are unsure how their loved ones contracted coronavirus. Darren, who had Down\u2019s syndrome, had not left his home since February except to attend hospital appointments. His mother, who had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema, had also been shielding, and Dean only went out once a week to shop for his parents. Ten other members of the family, including Debbie, David and Claire, also tested positive for coronavirus and have been self-isolating. \u201cWe were scared of the virus anyway,\u201d said Debbie. \u201cBut now we are absolutely terrified \u2026 I\u2019m so scared because of losing the three of them that I\u2019m going to lose my dad or somebody else.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
