In Australia this week, it was journalist Tracey Spicer firing salvos at the omissions of our local legacy monuments. \u201cIn this country, there are more statues of animals than there are of real Australian women,\u201d was her blunt announcement in Fairfax, revealing only 3% of public statues in Australia honour real-life, non-royal women. The majority of state-sanctioned monuments are \u2013 as if we need to be reminded \u2013 dedicated to the achievements of white men. The gender bias phenomenon in memorialisation is, of course, hardly new \u2013 the stats not endemic to Australia. In America, writes Spicer, they call the lack of monuments to women the \u201cmarble ceiling\u201d, but the tradition of gendered forgetting spreads far beyond both American borders and what\u2019s merely carved in stone. The disremembered legacies of women\u2019s contributions to public life, literature, art and all other spheres of human endeavour extend far beyond the pre-emptive suppression of women\u2019s genius considered by Virginia Woolf when she speculated on the fate of \u201cShakespeare\u2019s sister\u201d. It\u2019s only been a project of very recent history to gather the fragmented histories of women who overcame attempts at their limitation \u2013 Sappho, Artemisia Gentileschi, Aphra Behn, Camille Claudel, Zora Neale Hurston, Fran Ross, Clarice Beckett, Bessie Rawlings, Ada and Lena Austin and the thousands of other greats erased from view \u2013 some for decades, some for centuries \u2013 as male preferences determined the priorities of remembrance. It\u2019s a phenomenon of which I\u2019ve been made mindful this week, having watched a preview of Sari Braithwaite\u2019s short documentary, Paper Trails, which records the decline of the late Anne Deveson. Deveson was a journalist, an Australian broadcast pioneer, a brilliant writer, an activist, a feminist leader, a survivor of family violence and a mental health advocate, her face and voice recognisable to decades of Australians. The film was shot as her personal archives were prepared for donation to the National Library, in the months that the Alzheimer\u2019s disease that had felled her mother and grandmother before her came to claim her, too. Deveson\u2019s remarkable daughter, novelist Georgia Blain, succumbed to a brain tumour the same week as her mother died, in December, 2016. Braithwaite\u2019s film, which will be broadcast on ABC TV\u2019s Compass in Mental Health Week, is a moving tribute, but as the generations of our world-changing, second-wave feminist foremothers face the inevitable onset of old age and mortality, what constitutes adequate recognition for the magnitude of their social contribution \u2013 and what will be structurally, politically, materially required to preserve their legacies \u2013 is a question too important to the ongoing feminist project for us to deprioritise or ignore. There is a role for the dead among the living. Public art and national memorials are ever the \u201cornaments of the state\u201d \u2013 with the role of representing the priorities of the state to itself, as well as to its citizen audience. The present failure of state and federal governments to apply a gender lens to the effect of budget decisions, to address the economic inequities that beset women and to even consider the different needs of women\u2019s health and aged care should not surprise in a nation where real-life women comprise a mere 3% of our monumental landscape and habitual paucity among what is seen to be important. Indeed, the process of women\u2019s cultural vanishing often begins before we\u2019re even dead. Our ageing faces tend to fade from the screens in front of us as media tradition reaffirms a preference for aesthetics of feminine beauty that were defined for us by the kind of middle-aged men who bang and marry teenage girls. \u201cScientists at Duke University\u2019s Center for Metamaterials and Integrated Plasmonics are close to perfecting an invisibility cloak,\u201d wrote a columnist for Salon in 2013, \u201cI want to give them a tip: If you want to make a person invisible, just put them in the shoes of an over-fifty woman and abracadabra, watch them disappear.\u201d The cultural message of obsolescence is transmitted to the workplace. Jane Caro has observed that when women turn 50, \u201ctheir ability to remain employed becomes shaky\u201d and because women continue to dominate the low-paid occupations, older women who lose their jobs face nothing short of \u201cdisaster\u201d. Such is the reason women over 55 are the fastest growing demographic of the Australian homeless. Is change possible? Yes, but change only results from deliberate projects, symbolic and structural. Vogue Italia\u2019s decision this month to dedicate its issue to women over 60 is an interesting gesture, so is Maybelline recruiting Elon Musk\u2019s mother, Maye, as a Covergirl. The challenge remains to remember women visually for more reasons than the visual. Following her death, Anne Deveson was eulogised by both Turnbull and Shorten in parliament, and there was a public memorial service for her last February. With her life\u2019s work archived in Canberra and interest in her achievements rekindled by the documentary, my hope is that movement builds towards even more tangible, visible acknowledgement of her work. One can think of many memorialised in bronze or stone, with far less impressive achievements. Paper Trails airs on ABC\u2019s Compass Saturday October 14 as part of Mental As week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
