The property website Rightmove compared the prices of more than 2m homes to name the winners and losers of the last decade. Bristol was home to Britain\u2019s top spot as well as six of the top 10 areas outside London. The current average asking price in Easton, which in 2019 was named by Time Out as Bristol\u2019s \u201ccoolest\u201d neighbourhood, is now \u00a3283,397, an increase of almost \u00a3155,000 since 2010. Despite this, it is still one of the relatively affordable areas of the city. Estate agents said prices across Bristol have boomed during the decade, with buyers attracted to the city\u2019s good quality of life and the fact that it is viewed as an \u201cinteresting\u201d place to live. The next biggest increase outside London was in Swanscombe, near Dartford in Kent, where average prices increased 106% over the decade to an average of \u00a3326,106. On the other side of the Thames estuary, in Tilbury, Essex, house prices almost doubled over the same period. In the capital, Rightmove said, Walthamstow homeowners were clear winners, with prices soaring 117% since September 2010. The north-east London district was closely followed by locations in north, east and south London, with prices in Peckham, Tottenham, Forest Gate and Elephant &amp; Castle all increasing between 103% and 107%. Tim Bannister of Rightmove said: \u201cDemand for property in Bristol is exceptionally strong right now. Average asking prices across Bristol as a whole are up by 60% over the past decade and it\u2019s one of the UK\u2019s most thriving regional centres. \u201cBristol has a highly diverse mix of housing stock and is a city where a number of tech companies have based themselves, making it a very attractive place to move to for many buyers.\u201d He said average asking prices had risen nationally by \u00a393,046 in the 10 years, from \u00a3226,950 in September 2010 to \u00a3319,996 now, an increase of 41%. The data, however, shows that prices have not gone up in every area. Homebuyers in Nairn, on the coast near Inverness, have watched values fall 15% during the last decade to less than \u00a3200,000, although living near the town\u2019s sandy beaches, with the chance to see dolphins, may have softened the blow. The residents of Linthorpe, Middlesbrough, have suffered the second worst decline by percentage \u2013 a 12% fall in 10 years. An average house there now costs \u00a3128,352, the data shows. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 October 2020.
