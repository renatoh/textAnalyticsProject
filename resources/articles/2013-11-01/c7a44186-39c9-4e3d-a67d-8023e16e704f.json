It's all a big jerk-off \u2013 the hotel sucks, the real estate person is stupid, and the only thing the car salesman is good at is ripping you off. And why? Because awards don't mean a goddamn thing.\" One suspects Seinfeld does not hang around people who wear tracksuits for their day job. Rarely has a silver-plated trophy been more craved, or slab of Perspex so cherished, as when the words \"\u2026 of the year\" are engraved on it. And as autumn loses its beanie-hatted wrestle with winter, and we lurch slightly merrily towards 2014, sports folk reluctantly slip into starched shirts and bow ties, and cross their fingers. From the rest of us, however, there seems to be a catarrhal sniff of indifference. It was heard from those football puritans after Cristiano Ronaldo's bravura hat-trick for Portugal against Sweden in Tuesday's World Cup play-off. They believe it is wrong that a team game, such as football, should honour individuals; that one match should never be a plebiscite; and that the Ballon d'Or voting process is flawed, with a jumble of players, managers and journalists, too, often voting in their national interest and not the sport's. There will be more criticisms of awards on Tuesday when the shortlist for the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year \u2013 an event that seems to grow in importance and length with every TV rights deal the BBC loses \u2013 is announced. Some of it is justified. We know that Sports Personality has a split personality; and that trying to mould two distinct attributes, sporting prowess and everyman likeability, into a single trophy is impossible, just as it would be if the Nobel prize for chemistry was occasionally given to a professor who made the best fart gags. The Ballon d'Or has become less an evening of celebration than a PR-campaign-cum-cult-of-personality contest which lasts from May to December. Then there is the fliff and flim-flam that makes up the 90-minute ceremony in Zurich in January. Fifa, for instance, even has a presidential award for \"a person or institution that has made a superlative contribution to football without seeking to monopolise the limelight\" \u2013 which, in an irony more delicious than anything in the Great British Bake Off, is awarded by Sepp Blatter \u2026 to the person in the entire universe who behaves the least like Sepp Blatter. To think: all these awards dinners \u2013 the thousands of vol-au-vents of indeterminable taste and uneven texture; the millions of arborio rice grains gloopified into savourless risotto-splodge by a 1,200-watt industrial microwave; the countless bottles of table-top white wine cooled not with ice but the repeated flapping of a nearby exit door \u2013 for what? And yet. Over the past week I have attended the IAAF awards gala and the British Athletics Writers' Awards \u2013 and what has come across in stereo sound is just how much athletes care about being honoured. There was the joyous skip of Christa Bortignon, a 76-year-old from Canada, who won the world masters athlete of the year title after breaking the 200m record for her age category. Her time of 33.86 seconds is faster than most people half her age could run the distance. Yet she still thinks she can go faster. Harrison Dillard, still sprightly at 90, was delighted at being elected to the IAAF Hall of Fame. He is not a household name but he has a story to tell and he can still tell it. Dillard took up athletics after seeing Jesse Owens honoured by a parade in Cleveland to celebrate his 1936 Olympic victories. He was later given his first pair of spikes by Owens, before winning 100m gold at the London 1948 Olympics and 110m hurdles gold at Helsinki four years later. At the BAWA event in London, Christine Ohuruogu \u2013 arguably Britain's most successful female athlete \u2013 was relaxed and genuinely happy as she talked through her 400m victory in Moscow, after winning the women's athlete of the year. Asha Philip gasped as she was given the inspiration award. In 2007 she was the world youth 100m champion before wrecking her knee at the Trampoline World Championships in Canada. Six years later, four of which were spent injured, she reached the semi-finals of the 100m at the world athletics championships. You may think awards ceremonies are overblown and that a handshake and handing-over of a trophy would suffice. That may be right. Yet there is something to be said for awards per se. In the crash-bang-wallop world of 24-hour news they allow individual achievements to be etched on books, minds and hearts for posterity. They can reinforce the greatness of some teams \u2013 look at the individual awards Real Madrid won in the 50s and 60s \u2013 and serve as a reminder of those that history may have otherwise forgotten. Most of all they give people the chance to show others that they appreciate them. And that, surely, is no bad thing. \u2022 This article was amended on 25 Novmeber 2013 to correct Harrison Dillard's age from 80 to 90."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
