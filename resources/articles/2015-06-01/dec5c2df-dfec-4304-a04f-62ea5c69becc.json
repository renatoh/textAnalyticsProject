Fancy dodging transport problems before they happen? What about a system for rewarding those who walk rather than take the car? At the Imagine Festival in Milton Keynes last week, the potential of technology to revolutionise the way we move about was on display, as a host of young entrepreneurs vied to offer creative solutions to 21st-century travel dilemmas. Virtual reality systems, multidirectional treadmills and incentivising websites were among the innovations promising to transform not only our existing transport systems but to help develop new ones too. Hoping to banish commuter blues for good is London-based Zipabout. Collating travel schedules, real-time updates, detailed weather data and the word on the street gleaned from social media, the team have created a platform that can be used by developers to create systems such as intelligent journey planners that tackle \u2013 and even anticipate \u2013 travel nightmares. \u201cThe idea is that you wake up in the morning [and your] phone pings up a notification saying we know your train that you usually take is going to be delayed this morning because it\u2019s raining, and it\u2019s half-term and it gets really busy and [it] will proactively suggest that you take [a] different route,\u201d says Zipabout\u2019s technical director, Daniel Chick. The team are also working on a pilot in Oxfordshire that uses the platform to help operators to improve their services. Others are dangling an appealing carrot in front of passengers to influence behaviour. Currently operating in Lowestoft, Suffolk, Bounce is a project that uses an interactive website to entice the public into embracing sustainable modes of transport \u2013 be it car sharing, cycling or using public transport. By logging journeys on the website during specific \u201cchallenge\u201d periods, you can win rewards ranging from cinema tickets to vouchers for family trips. \u201cEvery time that [users log a journey], it\u2019ll earn them some points, and the points will get them prizes,\u201d says Stephanie Norris, a senior consultant with Integrated Transport Planning, which has developed the project. \u201cYou earn more points by using more sustainable transport,\u201d she says, adding that a new challenge period is set to launch this month. It\u2019s not just our approach to journeys that looks set to get smarter \u2013 vehicles, too, are constantly being upgraded. Technologists at i-Abra have developed software that uses cameras, similar to those in mobile phones, to give vehicles \u201cvision\u201d in order to detect and recognise a host of obstacles, from bollards to children. Not only is the system cheaper than radar systems, they say, but, thanks to machine learning algorithms, it\u2019s smarter than existing camera-based systems since it can be \u201ctrained\u201d during development to improve its recognition prowess. \u201cWe think that we\u2019ll start to see this [recognition system] pretty mainstream [in] 18 months to two years,\u201d says managing director Ian Taylor. When incorporated into a vehicle, says chief technology officer Greg Compton, the system could alert a driver to take action by means of an audible warning or holographic dashboard display, while it could even be developed to enable a vehicle to respond to potential hazards itself. Virtual reality also looms large, with a host of innovations. Among them is the Omnifinity Omnideck 6, a device that sounds as if it came straight from the mind of Douglas Adams. A 360-degree treadmill hooked up to a VR headset and tracker system, the platform allows the adventurous to physically move around a virtual environment and come face to face with the future of transport. \u201cWe can put humans into a virtual world and they can see how [driverless] pods are coming towards them,\u201d says Martin Pett, principal technologist at the government\u2019s Transport Systems Catapult (TSC). \u201cThere\u2019s a whole load of questions there about that behavioural relationship between machine and human that we can experiment with \u2013 a whole load of different scenarios \u2013 really, really quickly and repeatedly.\u201d Previously deployed for military purposes, a commercial version of the Omnideck has been bought by the TSC and installed at the Imovation Centre with the hope that it will encourage businesses and researchers to use the system to explore human responses to novel scenarios. And with the Lutz Pathfinder pods set to be trialled in Milton Keynes later this year, the answers could prove invaluable both in developing the vehicles and alleviating concerns. Geve is a company that is also planning to unleash virtual reality to combat apprehension over the future. Based on technical information, its immersive system can explore new developments. \u201cThe first thing you have got to deal with is the fear factor,\u201d says co-founder Richard Johnston. Pop on a VR headset and it\u2019s possible to explore, for example, the impact of a new train line on the living rooms of nearby houses. And it can help engineers too, with the simulated environment offering them the chance to identify and solve problems. \u201c\u2018Intelligent mobility\u2019 is transforming the way we move people and goods,\u201d says Dr Paul Zanelli, chief technology officer of the TSC, which ran the two-day festival at its Imovation Centre. \u201cOur job is to try to create the environment where companies can see that the UK is a place to come and exploit that global opportunity,\u201d he adds. Ultimately, says Zanelli, technology has the potential to turn travelling into an efficient, sleek and enjoyable experience. \u201cWe can get a lot more out of what we have got just doing things more intelligently, and we can make the experience for people massively better,\u201d he says."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
