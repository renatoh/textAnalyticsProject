We\u2019re learning that thinking about exercise is not the same as actually doing it.\u201d And we\u2019re also learning \u201cwhich leaders around the world deserve the title of \u2018leader\u2019\u201d. Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orb\u00e1n, for example, expanded his powers to rule by decree until the pandemic is over, \u201cwhich essentially makes him a dictator for as long as he wants\u201d, Noah explained. And in Belarus, President Alexander Lukashenko advised citizens to protect themselves from coronavirus by chasing a sauna visit with vodka two to three times a week. \u201cThat\u2019s a real thing a president said, and you know your medical advice is bad when it makes Goop look reasonable,\u201d said Noah. But \u201cif you\u2019re going to talk about leaders who don\u2019t deserve the title leader\u201d, said Noah, \u201cyou would be remiss if you didn\u2019t mention the man himself\u201d: Donald Trump, who every day \u201cshows us why he is not the right leader for this moment \u2026 or any other moment\u201d. Luckily, said Noah, the president has backed down from his plan to reopen the economy by Easter (12 April), \u201cbut he does continue to make a fool of himself\u201d. For example, on Monday, he confidently overstated the population of Seoul by 28 million people. \u201cThis is why I don\u2019t think Trump is a billionaire,\u201d said Noah. \u201cNot because he\u2019s a liar, not because he\u2019s a fraud, just because I don\u2019t think he understands how numbers work.\u201d Coronavirus has offered disheartening examples of \u201cfailing\u201d leadership, Noah concluded, but some are rising to the occasion: South Korea\u2019s government took the threat seriously and handed control of the crisis to medical experts. South Africa\u2019s president didn\u2019t hesitate to shut down the country. \u201cAnd here in America, in the absence of leadership from the White House, governors from California to Ohio are stepping up to fill the void,\u201d Noah said. \u201cBasically, what\u2019s happening in America is whatever happens when a family has like an alcoholic dad and the kids just have to raise themselves.\u201d Stephen Colbert From his home in New Jersey, Stephen Colbert \u2013 wearing a suit jacket on top but no dress pants \u2013 offered some good news: new data suggests that physical restrictions are slowing the spread of coronavirus infections. \u201cIt\u2019s working!\u201d he said. \u201cJust keep doing it, America, and by it, of course, I mean nothing.\u201d Colbert also explained why he hasn\u2019t discussed Trump, the standard target of his monologues, for the last month: \u201cWhile he\u2019s commander-in-chief, he\u2019s just not that helpful. But since he is the president of the United States and he is holding daily briefings to update us on this national emergency, let\u2019s check in with how he has addressed this unprecedented crisis.\u201d Colbert cracked a beer as Trump praised his hair and solicited expertise from the CEO of MyPillow. \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise Trump would introduce the MyPillow guy at a presidential briefing \u2013 it\u2019s a tradition going back to Harry Truman announcing victory in the Pacific with Chef Boyardee,\u201d Colbert deadpanned. Seth Meyers On Late Night, Seth Meyers interviewed the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, who dodged a question on whether she would join a 2020 presidential ticket as vice-president. \u201cI\u2019m focused right now on this crisis,\u201d she said. Meyers followed up with a question about her endorsement: \u201cYou haven\u2019t endorsed a candidate yet, and it certainly seems like your positions line up more in lockstep with Senator Sanders than they do with Joe Biden. Are you going to endorse, or is this something you\u2019re considering to wait on?\u201d Warren dodged again: \u201cYou know, again, I really want to say that, right now, it\u2019s less about the politics and much more about the crisis that our country is in, and I think that\u2019s really where our focus has got to be at this moment,\u201d she replied. \u201cSo that\u2019s where I\u2019m keeping my attention right now. We don\u2019t get to do any political rallies at this moment anyway.\u201d Warren also praised Kate McKinnon\u2019s impersonation of her on Saturday Night Live (\u201cShe\u2019s such an incredibly talented comedian\u201d), recalled how she once was mistaken for McKinnon in a grocery store, and confirmed a rumor that she fought between dress rehearsal and the live show to keep several lines in her scene. \u201cI can tell you, having worked there and having been a writer on the show,\u201d said Meyers, \u201cthe writers who wrote those lines, the fact that you fought for them \u2013 they will be fans of yours forever.\u201d Jimmy Kimmel In Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel recapped Trump\u2019s frequent touching of the communal White House microphone at his press briefings. \u201cWe just witnessed a battle between ignorance and germaphobia,\u201d he said of one clip, \u201cand germaphobia got knocked out cold.\u201d Tuesday was the first day of work for Trump\u2019s new chief of staff, Mark Meadows, a former North Carolina congressman who\u2019s \u201cone of Trump\u2019s most enthusiastic suck-ups\u201d, said Kimmel. \u201cIn fact, the only reason he agreed to take the job of chief of staff is because he found out first lady was taken already. \u201cCan you think of any worse first day of work than in the Trump administration in the middle of a pandemic?\u201d Kimmel wondered. \u201cI would rather be the assistant manager at Popeye\u2019s the day those chicken sandwiches came out.\u201d And finally, ABC announced that it has cancelled the Bachelor Summer Games. \u201cThis suddenly just got real for me,\u201d said Kimmel. \u201cI guess they had no choice, but the truth is, corona is only the third most dangerous virus lurking in the Bachelor hot tub.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
