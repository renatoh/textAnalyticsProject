The Clinton campaign had no comment. He\u2019s in this until every last vote is counted and he\u2019s fighting for every last delegate. \u2013 Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs, not kidding The presumptive Republican nominee has spotlighted a 1999 rape allegation against Bill Clinton and called the 1993 death of deputy White House counsel Vincent Foster \u201cvery fishy\u201d. Trump could face chaos in \u2018riot happy\u2019 California city Foster was a lawyer who killed himself months after coming to work at the White House for Bill Clinton, a childhood friend. Trump has taken a conspiracy theorists\u2019 line that it was \u201cmurder\u201d. Rubio: \u2018It\u2019s not that we lost, it\u2019s that Trump won\u2019 [Foster] had intimate knowledge of what was going on. He knew everything that was going on, and then all of a sudden he committed suicide\u2026 I don\u2019t bring it up because I don\u2019t know enough to really discuss it. I will say there are people who continue to bring it up because they think it was absolutely a murder. \u2013 Donald J Trump After Trump released an attack ad yesterday which samples a 1999 interview in which she alleged that Bill Clinton sexually assaulted her in 1978, Juanita Broaddrick told Fox Radio on Monday night that it was a \u201crape\u201d. \u2018It\u2019s hard for me to say the word \u201crape\u201d\u2019 Clinton\u2019s attorney denied the allegations on his behalf at the time, and Broaddrick herself had testified in a deposition that Clinton did not make unwelcome sexual advances. SEIU makes climate change a priority One person to investigate the Foster case was Kenneth Starr, who later was special prosecutor on the Monica Lewinsky case. Leave aside the unpleasantness, his genuine empathy for human beings is absolutely clear. It is powerful. It is palpable. And the folks of Arkansas really understood that about him, that he genuinely cared. The \u2018I feel your pain\u2019 is absolutely genuine. \u2013 Kenneth Starr Mr Trump is proud to pay a lower tax rate, the lowest tax rate possible. He is going to pay the smallest amount of taxes possible, which I think the American people also understand. \u2013 Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski Appeals court weighs Texas voter ID law Terry McAuliffe, governor of Virginia, is the subject of a federal investigation into his 2013 campaign donations and personal finances, with a possible nexus to foreign donors. This has nothing to do with the Clinton Foundation. This was an allegation of a gentlemen who gave a check to my campaign. I didn\u2019t bring the donor in, I didn\u2019t bring him into the Clinton Foundation, I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019ve ever met the person. \u2013 Terry McAuliffe, close Clinton pal"}, "isHosted": false}}}
