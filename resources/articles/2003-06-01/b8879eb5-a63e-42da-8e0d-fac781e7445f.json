Chief executive Mark Thompson said television had changed radically since the soap launched 21 years ago and was no longer an environment in which it could survive. \"Brookside has been a fantastically creative and brilliant programme for Channel 4, pioneering dramatic and cutting-edge storylines. It has always remained a high quality drama, but television has changed radically since Brookside's inception and it is no longer an environment in which we believe it can exist and thrive,\" he said. The axing of the show was viewed as inevitable after it was shunted to a Saturday daytime slot last autumn. Brookside creator Phil Redmond said fans would be \"sad\" at Brookside's passing, but added: \"I'm particularly pleased that the programme will end on such a strong year, doing exactly what I intended it to do 21 years ago - blending entertainment with the raising of social issues.\" Channel 4 has said it has no plans to replace Brookside with another soap opera, although it will show its existing teenage soap Hollyoaks five nights a week from this autumn."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
