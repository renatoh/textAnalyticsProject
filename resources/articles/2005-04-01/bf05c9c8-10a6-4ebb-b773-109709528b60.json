It might not be the most sophisticated or versatile wireless music system, but the Philips WACS700 could propel multi-room digital music systems into the mainstream. The main unit \u2014 which has a 40GB hard disk, CD player for ripping music to the system, and speakers \u2014 looks good and is easy to use. It connects to speaker/wireless tuner-only slave devices via 802.11g Wi-Fi. Owners can have up to six units on one system. The only drawbacks are that it is not compatible with iTunes and won't let users transfer MP3s to a portable device. 2) NHJ VTV-201 (about \u00a3129, May). If you can't wait for TV on your mobile \u2014 which will probably reach the UK next year \u2014 how about a wrist watch with a screen and mini analogue TV tuner? With the VTV-201, you can watch any terrestrial channel while listening to the broadcast on earphones. But it only shows an hour of programmes before the battery needs recharging. 3) Slingbox (about \u00a3250, September). The Slingbox, one of the hottest items at January's CES gadget fest, is a set-top receiver that enables you to watch whatever is on your home TV on a PC wherever you are, as long as you have a fast internet connection. The Slingbox takes the signal of whatever is on the set, encodes it in Windows Media format, then retransmits it to your personalised website. It also offers full control of devices in your home so you can access programmes stored on hard disk recorders or change channels while watching live TV. 4) T-Mobile MDA IV (about \u00a3300, July). The MDA IV, the latest in a series of Microsoft Windows-powered PDA-style smartphones from Taiwanese manufacturer HTC, has two key innovations. First, it can be used horizontally, a bit like Nokia's Communicator series phones. To make the most of this, it sports a full and easy-to-use Qwerty keypad. Second, it is the first Microsoft-based phone compatible with 3G, so users can download large files quickly and access the web at high speeds. Other products to watch out for: Sony PSP Is this the ultimate handheld games console? It's expected to reach the UK in June. Sony NW-HD5 At last, a real rival to the iPod. Expected next month. Motorola's iTunes-compatible phone Rumoured to be the e790 and expected in the UK in late summer. Nikon D50 Successor to the ultra popular D70 digital SLR camera. On its way soon. \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Online, send your emails to online.feedback@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
