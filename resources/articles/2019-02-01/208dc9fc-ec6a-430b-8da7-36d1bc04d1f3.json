Billy Vunipola says he wants to show the Welsh just how much he cares by helping England win at the Principality Stadium. No joke. Vunipola moved to Wales when he was six years old, and he has so much affection and respect for the people he knows there that he will be using those feelings as fuel for the \u201cemotional battle\u201d. After all, Vunipola says, when you are looking for motivation \u201clove works better than hate because you have a clear mind. With hate you think everything\u2019s wrong and it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d Vunipola is hard enough to be comfortable showing his soft side. He is happy to talk about how much love he feels for the Welsh, even though he knows full well that the feeling is not always mutual. \u201cThis game runs a little bit deeper, and everyone knows that, and we have to be prepared to fight that,\u201d he says. For his part \u201cthere\u2019s no hate there\u201d. He still has family and friends in Wales, from the five years he spent there while his dad, Fe\u2019ao, was playing for Pontypool, it\u2019s just that \u201conce or twice a year, we kind of divide\u201d. When he was a child, Vunipola never really understood why all his Welsh friends felt the way they did about the English. \u201cI just followed what everyone else was doing.\u201d But \u201cobviously now I\u2019m on the other side of the fence, I can understand them supporting their own. They are a very tight-knit community.\u201d It is up to England, he says, to match that intensity, \u201cbecause we know it\u2019s coming. They have said it themselves, and it\u2019s no joke. We would be kidding ourselves if we went there and said we can just do our job and everything would fall into place.\u201d He adds: \u201cWhen you play the Welsh it\u2019s always a very emotional game.\u201d It\u2019s just that his emotions are a little different to everyone else\u2019s. He will be thinking in particular about Terry Gordon, the old kit man at Pontypool \u201cwho took pity on my dad and took us all under his wing\u201d. Gordon died recently. \u201cWe were at his funeral in Wales a few months ago.\u201d When the family arrived in Wales they had never really been outside Oceania before, and had no idea what to expect. \u201cWe came in the winter in shorts and a T-shirt,\u201d he says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what to bring. \u201cWe were very naive when we first came over and didn\u2019t think it would be that cold.\u201d He remembers that he and his brother Mako were amazed that they could see themselves breathing. \u201cWe thought that was the coolest thing ever. We pretended we were like the old guys smoking. But it wasn\u2019t cool when we were trying to go to sleep and it was still happening.\u201d Gordon gave them \u201cextra duvets, extra pillows, jumpers \u2013 all those little things, those little gestures, and big things too: like helping with visas, and my dad\u2019s work permit and things like that\u201d. Mako has still got a hint of the old Welsh accent. Billy says he used to have one too but lost it when he won his scholarship to Harrow, because \u201cthey didn\u2019t understand me, so I tried to be very clear with my words\u201d. Despite all that, he says he has always felt loyal to England because the people there were so good to him. \u201cJust like in Wales, I had great people who brought me through the system,\u201d he says. \u201cI was only 15 at the time and I got called up to the under-18 set-up with John Fletcher and Peter Walton, and for three years those guys nurtured me, turned me into the player that I am today.\u201d That player, of course, is one of the best in the world, although he says he is still looking for his best form after all the injuries he had last year. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m there yet,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to build up to it.\u201d This weekend would be a good time to find it. \u201cThere\u2019s more urgency this week,\u201d he says, because two of England\u2019s best players, Mako and Maro Itoje, are injured. So he is feeling more pressure than ever to deliver, though he knows his Welsh friends will not thank him for it if he does. \u201cIt\u2019s only one game,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it is such a great occasion. You just hope you can come out the other side with a great result.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
