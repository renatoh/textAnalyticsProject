Any doubts over Jason Gillespie's form were dispelled here as he completed his best spell in months. Ponting's other area of concern was the top of his batting order but they have all scored runs and spent quality time in the middle. Gillespie, who bowled well throughout Australia's recent tour of New Zealand only to drop off substantially in England, showed signs of his old pace and movement against an overwhelmed Worcestershire line-up, claiming two for 45 from his 12 overs including the scalp of Graeme Hick. And, given that the Birmingham weather's recent impersonation of armageddon could result in a livelier-than-usual Edgbaston wicket - as Paul Collingwood's call-up yesterday would seem to suggest - the veteran South Australian quick could prove a key component of Ponting's attack in the second Test. \"I think he bowled probably better today than he's bowled all tour, so that's a very good sign for us,\" Ponting said of Gillespie yesterday. \"If you look at the way Jason bowled today and the way we performed in the first Test, you'd probably think it would be unlikely that we'll change the team.\" This tour match ended in a tame draw, with the Australians opting for additional batting time rather than chasing an outright victory. After Michael Kasprowicz's five-wicket haul helped skittle Worcestershire for 187 before tea, the Australians, having declared their first innings at 406 for nine, added 161 for two from the final 38 overs. In electing to bat a second time Ponting allowed himself and Michael Clarke additional time in the middle, given that both had missed out in the first innings. Though Clarke appeared caught behind early in his innings, he finished with a well-compiled 59. Ponting, too, posted 59 and remained not out, adding to the half-centuries of the openers Matthew Hayden and Justin Langer in the first innings. \"Our top-order batting in the first Test wasn't great because we had guys getting starts and not going on and getting big scores,\" Ponting said. \"Matty [Hayden] and Justin [Langer] spent some time in the middle and they both feel very happy with where they're at at the moment with their games. That was one area out of the first Test that we had to address and hopefully that changes come Thursday. \"If we can improve that, and if the bowlers can perform the way they did in the first Test, it's going to be difficult for England. \"It's hard work facing our attack any time but, with the way they bowled in that first game, if Glenn [McGrath] and Shane [Warne] and Brett [Lee] and Jason [Gillespie] can do that again, it's going to be difficult batting again.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
