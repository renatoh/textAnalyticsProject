Granted, tape was very expensive in those days, and judgements had to be made about what was worth preserving; but any sympathy you might have for the poor saps who had to make those calls tends to dissipate with the knowledge that every single one of the Lord Mayor's Shows from that era \u2013 possibly recorded over Pete and Dud \u2013 was kept. I am guessing those old Lord Mayor's Shows are not the most in-demand items in the archives, especially as the BBC still broadcasts the event every year. Colour and pageantry, you see, the kind of thing \u2013 as someone will undoubtedly tell you every time some Royal gets married or drops off the perch \u2013 we do better here than anywhere else in the world. And boy, does the BBC love a parade. No-one more so than Clare Balding, the Corporation's cheerleader for all occasions who was, of course, presenter on Saturday, as horses were involved \u2013 six of them pulling the Mayor's coach. In the BBC charter I believe it is written that Balding must present any programme in which creatures on four legs are prominent. At a time when the BBC is moving operations to Salford to demonstrate how London-centric it is not, is the Lord Mayor's Show not a bit of an own goal? I mean, that is not the Mayor of Thetford up there in the gold coach. It is not even the Lord Mayor of the whole of London, merely some corporate lawyer chappy called David Wootton, \"an ambassador for the City and financial services,\" according to commentator Paul Dickenson. Interviewed in his office overlooking the Square Mile, Wootton described his role as \"emphasising the good things about the financial services industry\" (good luck with that). He pointed to the buildings where \"your pension and mine is looked after\", from which I assumed they were taking better care of his than mine, and he would not have to spend HIS Saturdays cloistered with the telly trying to think of mildly amusing observations. To accommodate the Mayor, Football Focus was moved to BBC2. Or maybe it was hiding there, for shame. Watching still pictures \u2013 yes, still pictures \u2013 of Ireland's stunning win in Estonia, and highlights from the week's Johnstone's Paint Trophy matches, it was clear this was one of those weekends when the BBC might as well hoist up the white flag as far as football was concerned. ITV had the England-Spain match, the European Championship play-offs were on Sky and ESPN had the FA Cup. Focus's soundbites with the England players, though, did include the unusually astute pre-match observation from goalkeeper Joe Hart that \"it's not just what's on the field, it's what's off the field that makes England interesting\". Either by accident or design, the run-up to any England match these days has become like the precursor to a boxing title fight, with the various side issues undoubtedly helping to put bums on seats, 90,000 of them at Wembley. After the ludicrous row over the poppies and the controversy surrounding the England captain \u2013 what Glenn Hoddle, if asked, would almost certainly call the John Terry Situation (not a bad name for an acid jazz band by the way) \u2013 Danny Kelly's description of England on Talksport as \"the drama queens of international football\" seemed to me about right. There was an element of masochism in our enthusiasm for Saturday's international friendly. All week England fans' expectations were systematically lowered, to the extent that Adrian Chiles's comment on ITV before the match that \"if we get trounced 4-0 we'll have learned a valuable lesson\", will have had some viewers nodding in eager anticipation. No wonder the French talk about le vice Anglais. Fortunately, ITV had a foreigner on hand to restore a sense of proportion. Wigan's Spanish manager Roberto Mart\u00ednez was the first to point out at half-time that Fabio Capello was actually doing what we hired him for; setting up a defensive system to frustrate gifted opponents, and instilling the discipline in his players to stick to it. Mart\u00ednez made up a half-decent panel, joined by Jamie Carragher, mirroring Gary Neville's schtick on Sky, of bluff, northern, call-a-spade-a-spade common sense; and Gareth Southgate in his customary role as the sensible boy sent to the headmaster's study with the other two, blushing as he explains haltingly what has been going on. Be aware though, Roberto, that trying to bring a sense of proportion to a nation that thinks it fitting in the worst financial crisis since the last worst financial crisis to parade through the City in gold coaches and knee-breeches \u2013 and televise it, for goodness sake \u2013 might be a vain quest."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
