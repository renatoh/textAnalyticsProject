The Women\u2019s Super League team, who qualified for the competition after finishing second in last year\u2019s domestic competition, had beaten the Spanish champions 1-0 in Spain five days previously \u2013 ending their opponents\u2019 55-game unbeaten run at home \u2013 and needed only to avoid defeat to secure their progress. They were pegged back by their visitors throughout a tense first half at Ashton Gate, and Barcelona drew level on aggregate shortly before half-time when Maria Losada scored after a disputed free-kick. The home side controlled the second period and the decisive moment came seven minutes from time when, after Natasha Harding had been fouled, Watts scored calmly from the spot. Bristol saw out a nerve-wracking final flurry from the Catalan side and, in front of a 2,457-strong home crowd, won through to a last-eight draw that includes the Scottish side Glasgow City."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
