Petrov, the Bulgarian midfielder, had a reputation for being one of the most influential players in the Scottish Premier League during his trophy-laden period at Parkhead but his two years south of the border have been characterised by frustration and more recently, during an absence from the team brought about by O'Neill's loss of faith, by doubts about whether he has a future in claret and blue beyond this season. Whatever the outcome of O'Neill's quest for Uefa Cup football this season, the Ulsterman, funded by the American owner Randy Lerner's dollar resources, has ambitious plans to mould Villa into a force with genuine top-four ambitions next season and the 28-year-old may well have been deemed surplus to requirements because of his lack of impact, for all O'Neill's constant messages of public support. Such backing requires reciprocal support at some stage and perhaps the magnificent way Petrov reminded his manager and doubting Villa supporters of his obvious talents, from 50 yards to embarrass the already crestfallen Roy Carroll, might just have been the flash of inspiration all have been waiting for after he was taken out of the firing line in one last bid to jolt him into life in England. Carroll's awful clearance required instant chest control and an exquisite half-volley from the edge of the centre circle to propel the ball inside the angle of post and crossbar in the vacant goal. If a confident reaction was what O'Neill was looking for, he could not have asked for more . \"It was a wake-up call,\" said Petrov of his time on the sideline. \"When I don't play, I always blame myself first. I don't blame anybody else... I think the goal was the best one I have ever scored. When you score from that kind of distance it gives you a great lift. \"The manager decided I wasn't in good form and I don't need to play. I have been a good team-mate working as hard as I can and that is the way I am. The fans were singing my name which was nice. When you come to a new club you want to do well and when you don't do well it is hard. But I don't look back and haven't given up.\" O'Neill was delighted with Petrov's response. \"He's followed on from last week when he was superb. In this game I thought he was magnificent.\" Derby, however, were completely devoid of inner strength. They collapsed like a pack of cards from the moment the hapless Carroll allowed Ashley Young's free-kick to sail through his hands, before another poor clearance invited John Carew to claim his 10th goal of the season as Derby's winless run extended to a Premier League record of 28 games. For the third time this season they shipped six goals as Gabriel Agbonlahor, Gareth Barry and the substitute Marlon Harewood feasted on defensive chaos; the end of the season cannot come quickly enough for the manager, Paul Jewell, so as he can set about rewarding the 19,000 supporters who have already renewed season tickets. \"Never mind loyal, that is blind support. They want me to give them a team they can be proud of and I will be fighting like a tiger next season to do that,\" said Jewell.
