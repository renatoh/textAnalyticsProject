Tonight's show is evidence of the creative possibilities of the form: here is a lineup of techno producers, more often found steering sweaty dancefloors through the early hours, recalibrating their music for a seated audience. It makes for an evening of indulgent but beautiful music. The duo of Henrik Schwarz and Bugge Wesseltoft craft hypnotic shapes that shift seamlessly between delicacy and discord, lulling the audience into one mood before gradually and almost imperceptibly pulling the rug from under their feet. Matmos, meanwhile, are the Gilbert and George of electronic music: pranksters who turn sounds such as popping balloons and liposuction surgery into perky, listenable tracks. Detroit techno godfather Carl Craig and dub-techno pioneer Moritz von Oswald are no strangers to experimentation: on their 2008 Recomposed album, they reworked pieces by Ravel and Mussorgsky in a techno style. Joined by the pianist Francesco Tristano and saxophonist David Brutti, they deliver an astonishing 50-minute electronic symphony that retains the same crucial sense of peaks and valleys as their techno work. Audience cheers break out from time to time, mirroring the mood on a dancefloor, as the piano, saxophone, synths and beat take it in turns to dominate proceedings. The evening concludes with Terre Thaemlitz playing a set of melodic, danceable deep house in the Royal Festival Hall's Clore Ballroom, loosening up the audience's bodies and minds before sending them off into the night."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
