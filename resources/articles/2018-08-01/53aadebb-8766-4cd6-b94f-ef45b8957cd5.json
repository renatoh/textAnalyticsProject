The 23-year-old is expected to make his full debut for Marco Silva\u2019s team against Rotherham United in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday with Michael Keane out with a hairline skull fracture and Phil Jagielka suspended. Zouma agreed a season-long loan to Everton on deadline day after the Chelsea manager, Maurizio Sarri, confirmed the defender\u2019s first-team opportunities would be limited. But despite Sarri\u2019s admission and spending last season on loan at Stoke City, the France international believes he has a future at Chelsea where he remains under contract until 2023. \u201cI will go back, yes,\u201d said Zouma, who struggled to reclaim his place at Chelsea after a serious knee injury in 2016 and whose loan deal does not give Everton an option to buy. \u201cI have always believed in myself since I started playing football at 16. I have always wanted to show myself at Chelsea since I have been there. I know my injuries stopped me in the way I wanted to play but injuries are part of football and I want to show people I can come back and play there. That\u2019s why I need some game time at Everton here because they are a good team.\u201d Zouma asked for another loan move from Chelsea following talks with Sarri, who has started the season with David Luiz and Antonio R\u00fcdiger in central defence. \u201cThe manager arrived late and we didn\u2019t know what was the plan of the club,\u201d he said. \u201cAt Chelsea there were a lot of defenders. I knew I needed to play regularly so I didn\u2019t want to stay on the bench and wait for my chance after two or three months, so that\u2019s why I wanted to go. \u201cI spoke with the manager and he agreed with me. I knew at Chelsea they had five central defenders already. He plays with four at the back, so there are only two who play. I didn\u2019t want to wait and he completely agreed.\u201d Keane is expected to be sidelined for a month with the injury he sustained at Bournemouth on Saturday. Zouma said: \u201cWhat happened to Michael was very unfortunate for him. We all feel very sorry for him and we want him to come back as quick as possible. For my part I have come here to play and I want to take the opportunity.\u201d Real Sociedad have registered interest in signing Everton\u2019s striker Sandro Ram\u00edrez on a season-long loan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
