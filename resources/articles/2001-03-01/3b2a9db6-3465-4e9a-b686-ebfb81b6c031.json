They may well earn enough points to keep at bay a chasing pack of five clubs separated by only five points. Even so George Burley continues to refuse to tempt fate by agreeing that his team have a chance of winning the race. \"Our aim is to finish in the top six,\" he insists. \"Talk of a Champions League place is fairyland.\" It is a tone reminiscent of David O'Leary's famous underplaying of Leeds's chances early in the season. And no one believed him either. It is team spirit which underpins the Ipswich dream, and Saturday's victory was testament to that. Despite losing six of their previous eight games in all competitions, confidence remained high as they arrived at Upton Park. This was in stark contrast to West Ham. A run of one win in their previous nine league games, plus George Graham's last pitch-side act as Tottenham manager, had shot their confidence to pieces. \"Everyone was devastated when Spurs beat us in the Cup,\" admitted Harry Redknapp. \"Honestly I've never known a group of players so low. Against Ipswich our confidence was zilch.\" Certainly West Ham were unrecognisable from the side that romped home at Old Trafford in the fourth round. But this is the danger of Redknapp's approach, which relies on individual genius as much as team ethic. The side can only cope with the unbalancing affect of two free spirits such as Paolo di Canio and Joe Cole so long as the pair compensate with spells of magic. But both are badly out of sorts at the moment, young Cole to the extent that he was replaced at half-time. With Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9 also struggling - he last scored in the league in December - Redknapp suddenly finds himself looking over his shoulder at the relegation pack. Ipswich on the other hand have been better served by a more conservative approach. They too like passing the ball but are better balanced and boast vital width and more overall solidity. Certainly they were well worth Saturday's victory after dominating all departments and finding the net through Martijn Reuser's 18-yard bending free-kick after a foul inside the area which should have been a penalty. Scoring does remain a problem for Ipswich but Burley is on the case and is currently being linked with Southampton's James Beattie."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
