I counted the poppies I saw on people on the way. By the time I\u2019d swiped through the barriers at Southwark Tube I\u2019d been travelling for about an hour with many hundreds of people, but spotted only two wearing the remembrance symbol. One was a middle-aged black woman on the train from Hackney Central to Stratford. The other, on the Jubilee Line heading south, was speaking to a companion (another black woman) in a language I did not recognise - Mandarin? Korean? Vietnamese? - and looked as if she came from, or had roots in, south or southeast Asia. There was a poppy seller just inside the station, the first I\u2019d seen this year. From him, a white Englishman, I bought two of the traditional paper poppies and stuck them in my pocket to attach to my lapel later (I was in a bit of a rush by this time). Outside, at the junction of Blackfriars Road and The Cut, there were two more, a young white man and a young black woman (pictured above). Hurrying down The Cut, I passed a middle-aged white man with a poppy pinned to his overcoat. He was the last wearer I saw before walking through the radio station\u2019s doors. On air, the presenter remarked on how few poppy-wearers she too had seen around the capital. The contrast between this low early take-up level among the public and the heavy obligation to wear one when appearing on television was noted. So too was the ethnic and linguistic diversity of the London poppy-wearers and vendors I had seen on my way in. For me, this all revived recurring questions about remembrance, who participates in what numbers, how and why. The point I tried to make on air, and now offer again in the light of subsequent events, is that remembrance should be a charitable and voluntary matter through which loss and sacrifice are recognised, the past reflected on and the costs of war considered soberly. You do not have to have backed every conflict Britain has been part of since 1914 to participate, and to participate is not to approve of every decision to engage in war taken by British governments. Each person, here in London or anywhere else in the UK, will have their own reasons for marking 11 November each year and for doing so in their own way. Mine are mostly about my late father and being glad London survived the Blitz and that Britain wasn\u2019t over-run by Nazis, though I also think of soldiers from more recent history I have met. Those poppy-wearers I encountered on my excursion to Southwark will have their own, distinctive stories to tell. But there have long been those who politicise remembrance. Some on the left have always perceived it as representing nationalistic glorification and shunned it accordingly. In 2010, a handful of East End Islamists made their, quite literally, inflammatory point by burning poppies near the Royal Albert Hall. But it is the right, including some of its most powerful influencers, that routinely seeks to colonise remembrance for their own ends, imposing it on opponents and as an inflated sort of patriotism test - one that Labour leader Michael Foot was sneeringly deemed to have failed at the cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday way back in 1981. What Jon Snow has dubbed \u201cpoppy fascism\u201d is a contemporary manifestation of this. So too was that Brexit press furore over the England-Scotland match at Wembley played on Friday night, though in that case the attacks were on foreigners in the form of Fifa. The players and British football\u2019s national authorities were right to defy their dim and discredited international counterpart, but the backdrop to the episode is less easy to like. My radio appearance was on the same day the Brexit press attacked British judges for upholding British law over Article 50 and withdrawal from the EU. Now, foreign secretary, London MP and former London mayor Boris Johnson incorporates Donald Trump\u2019s election victory into his Eurosceptic performance and Nigel Farage parades himself as the representative of Britishness in the US. Those small acts of remembrance I\u2019ve witnessed in London are a reminder in these uneasy times that its ceremonies, symbols and often very private meanings can be misused on the platform of national life all too easily."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
