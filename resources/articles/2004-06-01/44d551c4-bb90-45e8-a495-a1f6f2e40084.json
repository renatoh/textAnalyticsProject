You don't have to go that far, but you will need \u00a31.95 million. This seven-bedroom house in Kingston Upon Thames has a huge winter garden (posh conservatory to you and me) built at the turn of the 19th century, which still has the original Victorian window system operated by levers. The winter garden, which measures 33ft by 22ft and 18ft high, is unheated but the current owners, Wendy and Michael Dinsdale, say they eat nearly all their meals in it from April to October. The winter garden is planted up with a loquat tree, plumbago, three types of jasmine, a passion flower and numerous ferns. It also includes a Victorian cast-iron, three-tier fountain, complete with swans and cherubs. Next to the winter garden is a traditional English country-style garden with lupins, delphiniums and sweet peas which leads into a second, more exotic, garden housing the heated outdoor swimming pool and planted with bamboo and bananas, some of which have fruited. Lord Liverpool is rumoured to have kept a mistress in the house in the 1800s, which may explain why, unlike its neighbours, the house interior is so ornate with hand-painted fireplaces, Chippendale-style plasterwork on walls and ceilings, and carved pelmets and display cabinets. Two flats had been split off the main house when the Dinsdales bought the house 11 years ago, but they have rejoined one, keeping the other as a self-contained two-bedroom apartment on the ground floor. The main house includes three reception rooms, one measuring 30ft long and leading into the winter garden, four bathrooms and two kitchens (a legacy of the second apartment upstairs). Kingston also boasts some of the most sort-after state secondary schools in the UK. But potential buyers should bear in mind that a fairly troublesome estate is within spitting distance of Liverpool Road. \u00b7 For sale through Hamptons International (020 8946 0081)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
