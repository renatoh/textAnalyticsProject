Traders said the prospect of the US economy being tipped into recession by the attrocities in New York and Washington was deflating any remaining market confidence. There have been about 50 profit warnings from US companies directly or indirectly linked to the attacks which destroyed the World Trade Centre and part of the Pentagon. In heavy, early trade the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by almost 5% to 8,484 points. The S&amp;P 500 Index also fell by about 5% to 986, the first time is has been below the 1,000 mark since October 1998. \"I think the market right now is seized by fear rather than rationality,\" said one trader. Dealers said the mood on Wall Street was bleak as workers prepared to attend the first of many memorial services for missing colleagues. The wave of selling followed a calmer day on Tuesday when the hopes of a further interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve put a floor under the market. On Monday, Wall Street reopened for business in defiant tone but more prosaic realities quickly took over, dragging the Dow to its largest ever one-day points fall. Yesterday's renewed bout of selling had a predictable effect on London where the FTSE 100 index of leading shares fell by 2.6% to 4,721.7. One of the most prominent warnings yesterday came from aerospace group Boeing which is cutting up to 30,000 workers because of an anticipated drop-off in orders. Other companies to make a direct link to the attacks have included a clutch of airlines as well as Dow Jones, Citigroup, Ford, Hilton, and American Express. Viacom, which owns the CBS television network, said yesterday full-year earnings would be lower than expected because of the non-stop news coverage during the events last week which led to higher costs and a significant loss of advertising revenues. About 1bn shares had changed hands by midday in New York in twice the usual trading levels. Wall Street had hoped that it would be shored up by a combination of patriotism and efforts by the Federal Reserve. Warren Buffett, the investor, and Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal earlier in the week pledged not to sell any of their shares. The Nasdaq composite index fell about 4% to 1,493.1. The hi-tech-laden index is now at one-third of its all-time closing high of 5,048.6 hit in March last year.
