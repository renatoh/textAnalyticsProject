The instructional slideshow, decorated with a bald eagle and American flag, advises officers to \u201cmeet violence with greater violence\u201d. It includes the line \u201c\u00fcber alles\u201d \u2013 a phrase from a Nazi-associated verse of the German national anthem \u2013 ironically juxtaposed against a background of American troops in Iwo Jima during the second world war. \u201cIt is entirely inexcusable for the words of Hitler to be used in training Kentucky State Police,\u201d the Anti-Defamation League tweeted on Friday. The genocidal f\u00fchrer is quoted more than any other figure in the presentation, on three separate slides. \u201cThe very first essential for success is a perpetually constant and regular employment of violence,\u201d reads one of the citations. A quote attributed to Lee, meanwhile, touts the importance of \u201ctruth and manliness\u201d in a slide titled The Thin Gray Line. During the American civil war, Confederate soldiers who betrayed the Union wore grey uniforms. The training\u2019s explosive contents were first reported by Manual RedEye, a high school news publication in Louisville, Kentucky, after a local attorney uncovered the slideshow while requesting information about a detective who shot and killed a man. Lt Josh Lawson of the KSP told student reporters that \u201cthe quotes are used for their content and relevance\u201d to teach \u201ctopics [that] go to the fundamentals of law enforcement such as treating everyone equally, service to the public, and being guided by the law\u201d. But Morgan Hall, the communications director for the Kentucky Justice and Public Safety Cabinet, called the controversial material \u201cunacceptable\u201d and said it had not been used since 2013. The slideshow\u2019s title page includes a subhead with the name of Lt Curt Hall, who according to LinkedIn was a decades-long veteran with Kentucky law enforcement. \u201cAs a Kentuckian, I am angry and embarrassed,\u201d congressman John Yarmuth, a Democrat, wrote on Twitter. \u201cAnd as a Jewish American, I am genuinely disturbed that there are people like this who not only walk among us, but who have been entrusted to keep us safe.\u201d He continued: \u201cAnd don\u2019t give us the \u2018it\u2019s a few bad apples\u2019 excuse. This is a poisonous culture that has gotten too many innocent people harassed and killed, and we refuse to stand for it any longer.\u201d More than a hundred people have been shot and killed by police in Kentucky since the start of 2015, according to a database published by the Washington Post. Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical technician, died in March after Louisville police raided her apartment and shot her. When no officer was charged directly with Taylor\u2019s death, Americans across the country took to the streets in protest, decrying yet another example of Black lives cut short by police violence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
