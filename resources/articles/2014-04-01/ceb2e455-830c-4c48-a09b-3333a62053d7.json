I\u2019m especially proud of my great grandfathers \u2013 George McClintock, Arthur Blackburn, Alexander Forbes and Tom Roberts \u2013 all of whom were lucky enough to survive Gallipoli and the western front. Yet what those men did has very little to do with me. On an intellectual level, I\u2019m not sure I can explain that pride. With the first world war gone from living memory, there\u2019s a push for a greater emphasis on the \u201cAnzac legend\u201d in history classes, and millions will be spent on centenary commemorations next year. As our enthusiasm for all things Anzac swells, it\u2019s worth stopping for a moment to try to justify our feelings about it. McClintock\u2019s diary, which my uncles found and transcribed, helped me do just that. Running low on cash in the early 1920s after the failure of his soldier-settler farm, he sold the diary for \u00a325 to the State Library of NSW. His health had never really recovered from the war and, sick with tuberculosis and injured while working on the Harbour Bridge, he died aged 41. The first thing that leaps out from the diary is my young great grandfather's quiet machismo. Writing about the defence of a position at Dead Man\u2019s Ridge at Gallipoli, he wrote: I could see one chap in particular crawling up to our trenches with bombs. I jumped into the trench and fired. I don\u2019t think that chap will tell anymore tales. He was no more than 10 yards from our trench. Shortly after doing away with the Turk in the trench, he was sent down the line with a message. On his way back he was called into a support trench by a corporal, from whom he bummed a cigarette. I had been smoking it a few minutes when, crash, I got one in the left arm in a line with the heart. The bullet remained in my arm. But I could see the end of it. He wrote later, this time after being shot through the thigh while making dinner: I have beaten the Turks again and they will have to make another bullet on me to kill. Another of my great grandfathers, Arthur Blackburn, was similarly cavalier when he told my grandmother that he won his Victoria Cross for \u201cjust being a soldier\u201d. In fact, he\u2019d led several near-suicidal mission against a German machine gun position at Pozi\u00e8res. His name is still on the town water tower. As for Tom Roberts, he wrote to his sisters (on a flannel rifle rag, using a biscuit tin as a desk) that he and his mates were \u201cas happy as soldiers lice\u201d, though the Turks had been putting \u201cthe fear of Allah\u201d into them. It\u2019s all rather thrilling, all these chaps doing in other chaps and getting shot. It\u2019s also natural, as time passes, to assume that people were just made of sterner stuff back then. Yet it does the generation who went to war a disservice if we believe they were supermen. What\u2019s amazing, and what we should be proud of, is that my great grandfathers\u2019 generation were probably not so different from us. As their gallows humour and self-effacing attempts to downplay their fear and bravery make clear, they were men struggling to adjust to awful circumstances. McClintock, for example, wrote of dry-retching after mistaking a dead comrade\u2019s foot for a tree branch and grabbing hold of it. Roberts wrote to his sisters to complain about a commanding officer who harassed him for not shaving. Growing up on the other side of the world in a period of relative peace, none of them expected to be thrown into a horrible war. In 1914, Blackburn had just graduated from law school and Roberts was working overseas. Perhaps optimistically, McClintock listed his occupation as \u201cboundary rider\u201d on his enlistment form, despite the fact that he grew up in the Sydney suburbs. They were also not all the doe-eyed colonials of the typical Anzac legend, ready to fight for the mother country. My grandmother describes Blackburn as \u201cvery Australian\u201d and says he enlisted because it was \u201cthe right thing to do\u201d, rather than out of any obligation to England. For his part, McClintock was rather more sympathetic to the Turks, who shelled the hospital at Gallipoli as he lay wounded, than to the English, who had left stockpiles of ammunition nearby. He wrote: The English call this fair fighting well I don\u2019t and it is not fair to the men in hospital and not fair to the enemy. The Turks fought us fair and I don\u2019t think anyone could have fought fairer. They were part of an entire generation who gave up their lives and their sweethearts for four years. The saw and most likely did awful things. The next generation was forced to do the same. When they came back, they were no doubt changed men. It\u2019s easy to say those horrors are unimaginable. Yet for those of us with no military experience, imagining the circumstances of those who have served Australia is a necessary part of remembrance. If we cast the Anzacs, the returned and the fallen alike, as fundamentally different from us, then it\u2019s impossible to even try to appreciate what they went through. If we turn them into purely mythic figures, then Anzac Day becomes merely an exercise in flag waving, a day for platitudes about freedom and sacrifice. The truth is much more stirring \u2013 that ordinary men did things most of us hope never to do, mostly because they thought it was right. I don't know if that's something for us to be proud of, but it's certainly worth remembering."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
