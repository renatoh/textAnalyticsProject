His promoter, Frank Warren, has accepted an offer from the Danish promoter Mogens Palle for the undefeated Welshman to meet the undefeated Dane in Copenhagen. Calzaghe's WBO super-middleweight title, which he has held since 1997, would be at stake with Kessler's WBA and WBC titles. \"Of course I would be prepared to wait until November for Kessler,\" Calzaghe said last night. \"I want to face him because people recognise that he is the other best super-middleweight in the world. I know he's a very, very good fighter. But I also know 100% that I would beat him, regardless of whether the fight happens in Denmark, Wales or the United States. \"He's the main man out there. He's big [6ft 2in to Calzaghe's 6ft] and strong but I think I can knock him out. I've fought in Copenhagen before and it's not the most hostile place in the world.\" Warren had been keen for a September fight, with the American television network HBO ready to provide a date, but Palle is offering him and Calzaghe only the British TV revenue. Also, the Dane wants to have a November contest to mark his 50th anniversary as a promoter. Although Warren has yet to sign a new British television deal - his current agreement with ITV expires at the end of this month - it is likely he will continue to work with ITV, which is committed to blanket coverage of the Rugby World Cup in September and may be reluctant to pay big money for a fight that might clash with an England's group match against South Africa or Samoa. Warren is still awaiting a signed contract from Palle, 73, who has a heart condition that required hospital treatment last week, but he remains optimistic the deal will be completed soon. \"The money and terms are very good. I just hope it wasn't a bluff and they didn't really think that we would be prepared to go to Copenhagen for the fight,\" he said. \"You could say we've put it on 'em, because I believe and Joe believes he can do a job on Kessler.\" The former world heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, who is a Ricky Hatton fan, will be in Las Vegas on June 23 when the Mancunian defends his WBC light-welterweight title against Mexico's Jos\u00e9 Luis Castillo. Tyson has agreed to work as a cornerman with Jeff Fenech, who is training the Australia-based Russian Victor Oganov for a fight against the American Antwun Echols on the undercard."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
