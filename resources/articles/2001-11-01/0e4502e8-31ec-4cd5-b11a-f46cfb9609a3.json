It is much more accessible, and family friendly and is an increasingly important part of life, according to a report by the Sir Norman Chester centre for football research at Leicester University. The only limitation was the rising cost. The study, Football and Families, interviewed fans contacted through clubs across England and Scotland. It found that more than half the parents who watched matches usually took their children with them. Adults and children perceived football as a chance to address moral, ethical and practical questions, and saw the focus on teamwork and loyalty as important lessons for children. The decline in hooliganism was a key factor in the resurgence of the sport. John Williams, an author of the report, said: \"Despite real issues of rising costs, football in Britain is more widely identified with broader forms of community inclusion - accessible to women and girls, attracting more ethnic minority fans, child and family friendly. \"Rather than being widely seen, as it might have been in earlier eras, as a sport which was too dominated by discomforting and sometimes alarmingly macho tribalisms and violent rivalries, football in Britain is now much more widely identified with broader forms of community inclusion.\" John Davies, a Millwall fan who attends matches with his 15-year-old daughter Sharon, said the game was more comfortable now, but the atmosphere was lost. He felt the sense of belonging, as a fan, taught teamwork. \"You not only support the team, you support each other. It's about belonging.\" However, his wife, Ellen, said she felt left out. \"They are often out late, too late to do anything,\" she said. \"I have been once or twice, but I am not impressed.\" However, the cost meant that football had become an occasional treat for some. Everton fan Eric Dunlop felt football was safer now. \"But it is harder to take kids because of the cost.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
