Nick Hardwick, the chief inspector of prisons, said the Serco-run Yarl\u2019s Wood centre was of \u201cnational concern\u201d after an unannounced inspection found it was failing to meet the needs of the most vulnerable women. Inspectors discovered 99 pregnant women had been held in the Bedfordshire centre in 2014, of whom only nine were removed from the UK, despite Home Office policy stating expectant women should not normally be detained. In a damning report, Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP) said healthcare provided by a subsidiary of G4S had declined severely and flagged two instances where abdominal pain in early pregnancy was not treated appropriately. Sexual allegations continue to beset Yarl\u2019s Wood. During the inspection one woman reported sexual contact between staff and detainees and four others claimed inappropriate sexual comments had been made by workers. Two staff were fired for engaging in sexual activity with a detainee in 2013 and a third employee was dismissed for failing to take any action when the women reported the two men after claims were made in the Observer. Inspectors said there were too few female staff at the 410-capacity centre and male nurses asked detainees intimate questions during healthcare screenings. Male staff entered bedrooms without knocking. Many of the women held at the centre are victims of abuse, rape and trafficking. Hardwick said the findings of the April inspection, the first undertaken since June 2013, provided support to calls to place time limits on \u201cadministrative detention\u201d, or detention without trial. Inspectors questioned the validity of holding many of the detainees after discovering 894 women were released back into the UK in the six months prior to the inspection \u2013 more than double the 443 removed from the UK. In addition, at the time of the inspection, 15 detainees had been held for between six months and a year, and four for more than a year. The longest had been held for 17 months. \u201cOther well-respected bodies have recently called for time limits on administrative detention,\u201d Hardwick said. \u201cIn my view, the rigorously evidenced concerns we have identified in this inspection provide strong support for these calls, and a strict time limit must now be introduced on the length of time that anyone can be administratively detained. \u201cYarl\u2019s Wood is rightly a place of national concern,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should not make the mistake of blaming most of this on the staff on the ground. While there have been instances of unacceptable individual behaviour, most staff work hard to mitigate the worst effects of detention and women told us they appreciated this. \u201cHowever, Yarl\u2019s Wood is failing to meet the needs of the most vulnerable women held. These are issues that need to be addressed at a policy and strategic management level.\u201d Ninety-two female detainees were interviewed in Yarl\u2019s Wood as well as a further eight who had recently been released and 39 staff. A \u201cdisturbing\u201d 54% of the detainees told inspectors they felt depressed or suicidal when they first arrived. Inspectors witnessed a pregnant woman wait for an hour to see a GP when she experienced back and abdomen pain, dizziness, breathlessness and nausea. She was advised to eat and drink normally and to take paracetamol for the pain when local protocol for antenatal services stated women who present with pain need immediate assessment and possible referral to an emergency ward. HMIP found use of force was well managed but inspectors were concerned about one incident in which an officer was suspended after using a defensive shield as a weapon against the legs of at least two women. Natasha Walter, the director of Women for Refugee Women, which coordinates the Set Her Free campaign to end detention of female asylum seekers, said: \u201cWomen for Refugee Women believes that women who seek sanctuary in the UK should not be detained. \u201cTheir cases can be heard more effectively, more cheaply and with less trauma to the women involved while women are living in the community. \u201cThe HMIP report gives further evidence that women seeking asylum should not be detained and that conditions in Yarl\u2019s Wood are not suitable for vulnerable women. It is time for action and to ensure that women who seek asylum are protected rather than subjected to further trauma.\u201d The Refugee Council chief executive, Maurice Wren, said: \u201cThe fact that people fleeing war and persecution are being locked away indefinitely in a civilised country is an affront to the values of liberty and compassion that we proudly regard as the cornerstones of our democracy. \u201cIf the government wants to prove it\u2019s serious about justice and protecting vulnerable people, ministers must urgently acknowledge that Britain\u2019s policy of arbitrarily placing people behind bars because it\u2019s politically expedient is wholly unjust, extremely expensive and utterly unsustainable. \u201cIt\u2019s high time Yarl\u2019s Wood and places like it were closed. Seeking asylum is a human right, not a crime.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
