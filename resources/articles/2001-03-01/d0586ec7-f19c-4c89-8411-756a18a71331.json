But now the web may be making the battle to get noticed just that little bit easier. Two of this year's Oscar nominated short films, The Periwig Maker and Una Historia de Futebol, were picked up, not through the traditional route of producers and agents, but straight off film websites. For aspiring directors entranced by the rags to riches mythology of the film world, the internet is providing both hope, and a new way to ensure their latest effort lands on the right desk. Neither film won an Oscar, but both gained valuable publicity. If the films sparked interest among any member of the global Oscars audience they can click online and instantly view either of the films in their entirety. At Atomfilms.com audiences can see the nomination for Best Animated Short Film, directors Steffen and Arnette Schaffler's darkly poignant tale of pestilence and paternalism The Periwig Maker (based on Daniel Defoe's A Journal of the Plague Year). Over on www.ifilm.com viewers can watch Paulo Machline's Una Historia de Futebol, one of the nominations for Best Short Live Action. A slice of popular subtitled nostalgia, the film is based around the mellow recollections of a group of ageing friends as they remember their childhood games of football in small town Brazil. Traditionally the only option available to aspiring directors was to hassle agents and production companies who would routinely ignore almost everything that dropped on their desk. But in a land where dot.com opportunities are never ignored for long, it was only a matter of time before someone would try and use the internet to close the gap between the thousands of hopefuls and the influential few. Webfilm portals soon sprang up, offering a tantalising glimpse of success for those willing to cough up the dollars necessary to get online. But it is not just films being picked up from the web. Paramount recently announced it had snapped up Mark Smith's western script, The Devil's Kiss for Mel Gibson's Icon Productions from ScriptShark, an IFilm site that provides script analysis for amateur screenwriters. But the odds are still slim. Only 5% of the scripts submitted to ScriptShark are actually published on the web, and even then it is rare for anyone in the industry to pick anything up. The site only lists four success stories alongside the dozens of scripts on offer. But for those wannabes willing to do anything to catch a producer's eye, these must look like sweet odds indeed compared to their pre-internet options. But for every reputable site like Atomfilms.com, IFilm.com, Inzide.com or ScriptShark, there are many others capitalising on the desperation of those trying to make it, and offering very little in the way of a return for their dollars. However, there is always the option of building your own website. \"We were so sick of the commissioning process,\" says writer Jane Sussman (Smack the Pony and The Fast Show), who co-wrote the comedy The Junkies, and received developmental money from Channel 4 after they saw it online. \"We got fed up of waiting for something to happen and decided the only way to get on was to get it out there and make it ourselves.\" The British independent filmmakers' mailing list www.shootingpeople.com is full of questions on how to get films online, and debate inspired by the web's potential for keeping filmmakers in control of their own publicity. For those who haven't yet made it, the web can also offer a community, some critical redirection and a sense of purpose. The Francis Ford Coppola-owned www.Zoetrope.com offers a \"virtual studio\" and writer's workshop, where scripts can be posted and commented on by other writers. While this has the potential to be fairly crushing, it does introduce writers to the harsh realities of the industry, and helps give them focus. Alliance Atlantis recently bought two scripts from Zoetrope.com's screenplay workshop, and this should be enough to keep the hopeful hoping, and persuade newcomers that the site has an influential audience. Perhaps online film's time is coming. The dot.com crash is beginning to fade from memory, investors are once again showing a cautious interest in internet film, and members of the Hollywood elite are following the indie hopefuls online. Despite being burned by the high-profile failure of his film site www.pop.com, Steven Speilberg is back screening short films starring Steve Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow at the blossoming film fan site www.countingdown.com. But despite all the help the web can offer, success in Hollywood still depends on having killer ambition. If you can contemplate failure, you're never going to make it. As a cynical Paul Newman once commented, \"Show me a good loser, and I'll show you a loser\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
