When he appears in the stand, it is not a problem. What is the problem is the players on the pitch who can win the game,\" reckons the Arsenal manager. \"It is the good passes that win the games. It is not the presence of somebody in the stands who loses you the games. You do not have to go overboard. The problem now is whenever Manchester United do not win a game the cameras go on Ferguson: he is the man who is missing. But I think that is the wrong problem.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
