The visitors, having won the Premiership title with such elan, saw no reason to show that quality here. Their line-up was even weaker than Chelsea's and that alone nurtures the hope that there will be a very different encounter at Wembley on May 19. The selections will be upgraded and, with luck, so too will the calibre of the play. When a rousing passage did come here it was because the ball ricocheted around the visitors' penalty area following fumbles by the goalkeeper Tomasz Kuszczak. He had, all the same, made convincing saves from Lassana Diarra and Salomon Kalou. In the end the lingering significance was of an unhappy sort. Scott Sinclair had made his first start for Chelsea and did enough to remind spectators of his virtuoso goal against Barnet while he was on loan at Plymouth. A tackle by Wes Brown, however, broke a metatarsal and the youngster has a summer of convalescence and rehabilitation ahead of him. There ought not to have been real hurt in a fixture with no prize at stake. Jose Mourinho's spat with the referee, Graham Poll, over the award of a foul against Claude Makelele did add an authentic feel to the night for a moment or two but the truth had never really been concealed. These clubs were determined to keep something in reserve. With so many youths and fringe players around the game was designed to have as little relation as possible to the FA Cup final. Mourinho and Sir Alex Ferguson must be satisfied that their intentions for Wembley have been concealed but no one else went home pleased. Only Brown, Gabriel Heinze and Alan Smith remained from the United starting XI that had chalked up what proved to be a title-winning victory over Manchester City last Saturday. Ferguson had even given a debut to the sturdy Chinese striker Dong Fangzhuo. In addition, Kieran Lee had his first Premiership appearance at right-back. For the visiting supporters the game was just a part of their purpose in being at Stamford Bridge and not necessarily the most important element. They had come to crow, as is the entitlement of fans looking down on the club who had yielded the title. Mourinho was taunted with a chant of \"You're not special any more\". It has been quite a while since anyone felt confident about saying that to the Chelsea manager. His squad had to applaud their Premiership conquerors on to the field. The plan, of course, must have been to follow that by embarrassing United in the game itself but that was not accomplished. In other countries the evening would have been given over to a vapid, technical contest. In England it comes more naturally to wrangle and save technique for another time. Mikel John Obi, for instance, took exception to a rough challenge by Smith and, seething over it, lunged at Chris Eagles to get himself booked. The contest was brisk and Chelsea, prior to the interval, came closest to a breakthrough when a long, mishit cross from Shaun Wright-Phillips almost sneaked into the top corner after 16 minutes. Earlier he had been put through by Mikel but his attempt was smothered by Kuszczak. There was a want of incisiveness. United could have gone ahead when Smith fed the ball through to Heinze after 37 minutes only for the Argentinian to hook his attempt wide. Any visitor oblivious to the context would have been incredulous at the news that these were the sides who have been vying for so long to dominate the Premiership. The introduction of Joe Cole at the interval could have been intended to lift the quality but the next notable incident was Brown's caution for the crude tackle on Sinclair and Diarra, fouling Eagles, was cautioned for Chelsea shortly afterwards. There was a monotonous recklessness and it was not long before Eagles himself saw a yellow card for a challenge, with studs raised, on Wright-Phillips. \"That's why you're champions,\" the Stamford Bridge support bayed. The truth about United's means of lifting the title is the exact opposite of that but this encounter stifled the best in each side."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
