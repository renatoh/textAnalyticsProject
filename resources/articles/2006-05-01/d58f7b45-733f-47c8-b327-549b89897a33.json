The \u00a395m project to replace world-renowned scientific labs in Teddington, south west London, was the first major contract under the Private Finance Initiative to be terminated because of serious deficiencies in contractor performance, said the report published today by the National Audit Office. Contractors Laser - a consortium of Serco Group and John Laing Construction - pulled out of the project with massive losses in 2004. Its sub-contractors had experienced lengthy and expensive difficulties in meeting the stringent requirements laid down for temperature and noise control in the labs, and Laser was concerned at the ever-mounting cost of solving the problems. The Department of Trade and Industry took over responsibility for finishing off the development, and it is now due to be completed within budget in 2007 - six years after the original completion date of 2001. The NPL is one of the world's leading laboratories working on the measurement of physical properties, such as time, length and mass, and its new buildings are intended to provide state-of-the-art facilities for scientists, including more than 400 labs. Today's report found that the DTI had doubts early in the bidding process over whether Laser was capable of delivering the NPL's technically challenging requirements. But it signed a 25-year contract in 1998 for Laser to build and manage the complex because it believed the PFI structure would create financial incentives for the company to find solutions to its technical difficulties and would protect the taxpayer from any liability if the project failed. In the event, the audit office found that the DTI did successfully transfer risk to Laser, so that the taxpayer did not lose out financially and scientists were able to continue their work. But the delays meant the DTI \"did not secure the full benefits it wanted, when it wanted them\". The chairman of the influential House of Commons public accounts committee, Edward Leigh, said both public and private sectors should take a share of the blame for the \"mess\" at the NPL. \"The private sector naively signed up to a technically demanding project without understanding how difficult it would be to deliver. They ignored the DTI's warnings,\" said Mr Leigh. \"But the DTI was not blameless. It genuinely had concerns during the procurement process that the private sector might not deliver what they were promising, but the DTI signed on the dotted line anyway. \"The DTI wanted to believe that this PFI project would be a success. In the real world, it wasn't.\" The NAO report found that risks to the project could have been reduced if the DTI had insisted on resolving concerns about Laser's designs before signing a contract. In future complex PFI projects, bidders should be required to demonstrate convincingly that they can satisfy performance obligations, said the report. The auditor general, Sir John Bourn, said: \"The Department for Trade and Industry handled the termination of the contract well. \"But different handling of the project by all parties at the early stages might well have avoided the problems which led to the termination.\" By the time the project is complete, the DTI's total capital investment in the new facilities is expected to have grown to around \u00a3140m, compared to an initial estimate of \u00a3130m, said the report."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
