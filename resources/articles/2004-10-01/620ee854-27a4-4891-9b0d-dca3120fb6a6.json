The company has replaced its conventional telephone arrangements with a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) system - which converts ordinary voice calls into packets of data that can be sent over the net - from Canadian company Mitel. This has provided increased flexibility for the firm's 74 partners and 495 employees. Now it is quick and easy for people to move their extension number to a new desk or take calls that come into the office when they are at home. And one bonus is that it is easy to dictate letters and other legal instructions over the phone and have them arrive on the right person's desktop PC. \"From the car after a meeting works for me,\" says Jackson. \"It's easier than sitting in front of my secretary while she waits for me to gather my thoughts. The dictation appears on her PC, or can be routed to another secretary.\" Jackson adds: \"I use the [VoIP] system not just in the office but at home over broadband, too. It means that if I've been to a meeting in Leeds, I don't have to go back to the office in Manchester just to send an urgent fax. Then when I log on from home, I can check what my secretary's typed up and can, if I need to, fax off a few documents.\" Some of these features are achieved by using Citrix software to connect the law firm's home-based users to the company's case system, but there is no doubt that VoIP makes the system more versatile. Pannone &amp; Partners first considered integrating VoIP with its IT system when its contract for the Centrex switching service expired early this year. It negotiated a one-month rolling contract while it looked for an alternative. At that time, the firm had to pay every time a lawyer changed desks and needed the telephone extension moved. It also took 10 days for the company they were using to make changes to the pick-up groups, which enable any lawyer in a department to answer the phone for another. Today, all the company's VoIP handsets plug into its data network, and a separate telephone network is not needed. To move a handset, all the user has to do is plug it into an Ethernet socket at their new desk, plug their PC into the handset, and change some parameters in the VoIP software. New pick-up groups can also be set up using the software. Chris Styles, the technical systems manager, says: \"The new system is more adaptable, costs less to maintain and integrates better with IT systems such as Microsoft Exchange (email) and Outlook (contacts).\" When a phone call is received in the office, the recipient can see the phone number/person calling on their PC screen. They can transfer the call to a colleague either before they've answered it, or afterwards. To ensure the client gets a quick response, they can also see, from a small icon on the screen, whether the lawyer they intend to transfer the call to is already on the phone. These features - as well as confer ence calling and being able to see if a colleague is away from their desk - will be available to most of the firm's lawyers from home this month. Styles says the VoIP system also records the length of calls for onward billing. The Mitel system cost \u00a3250,000 and was installed over a weekend. The external phone lines were simply connected to the firm's data network rather than to its old telephone network. For resilience, the 180 incoming lines are now connected to three linked switches, so if one goes down, the others can take over. Styles says: \"I did not find VoIP difficult to get my head around as I come from a data background, but I do advise any company thinking of putting in a system to get a thorough assessment of their local area network, to make sure it can cope with extra voice traffic. \"We got 360 Solutions [communications consultants] to do an assessment for us, and though we did not need to spend extra on expanding network capacity, we did have to prioritise voice traffic on the network, so there would not be a delay of even a second while people were speaking.\" The system could also help some of the firm's employees who are parents to balance work and family commitments by being able to work from home when they need to. Of its staff, 74% are female, and its managing partner, Joy Kingsley, has two young children. The old Centrex phone system isn't missed. Styles says: \"All it provided really was a handset on a desk - costing us money in maintenance, and in moves and changes.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
