Wenger claimed City will be unstoppable if they receive similar decisions to those that allowed Sergio Ag\u00fcero\u2019s penalty and Gabriel Jesus\u2019s goal in Arsenal\u2019s defeat at the Etihad Stadium. In response Pep Guardiola hit back, claiming Arsenal defeated Burnley 1-0 last October at Turf Moor thanks to a late Laurent Koscielny goal scored with a hand. City were leading 1-0 when Oliver awarded a penalty for Nacho Monreal\u2019s challenge on Sterling after 50 minutes. Ag\u00fcero scored and, although Alexandre Lacazette pulled one back just after the hour, Silva created Jesus\u2019s 74th-minute strike despite being marginally offside. The victory maintained City\u2019s unbeaten start to the season, giving Guardiola\u2019s team 31 points from 11 games. Yet the officiating that allowed Ag\u00fcero\u2019s penalty and Silva to continue playing left Wenger furious. \u201cI believe it was no penalty. We know that Raheem Sterling dives well, he does that very well,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the third goal was offside. I am very upset because at 2-1 we were in the game. The third goal was the killer and it is not by coincidence that mistakes always go for the home team, as we know. \u201cIt is unfortunate that the game finished the way it finished. I am disappointed. You can accept it if City win in a normal way, they are a good side, but this is unacceptable. Last season we lost two offside goals and it has happened again.\u201d Asked who may be able to stop City, Wenger was again scathing. \u201cIt will be difficult this season, the way they have started, the quality they have, but you never know. If on top of that they have decisions at home like that, they will be unstoppable,\u201d the Frenchman said. \u201cYou have seen what I have seen. The fact you tell me it is an offside goal says enough. I don\u2019t want to take anything away from the quality but it happened at a moment when we were really in the game at 2-1 and it killed the game. It is the second year. We got two offside goals here last year [in a 2-1 loss] and one this year. \u201cThe physical level [of referees] is very good, the decisions \u2013 at 2-1 we are in the game and he gives a key offside goal, and that kills the game for us. Last year if you look as well, we conceded two offside goals. Of course, they are a top team, but that makes it even more difficult for you.\u201d Wenger\u2019s claim that Sterling simulates leaves the manager open to a potential FA charge as it questions the integrity of the player. Guardiola brushed off the comments. \u201cNo, we won,\u201d said City\u2019s manager. \u201cWe won in the best way and we deserved [to win] by far. The chances we created and the few chances we conceded. They tell me it was offside and I don\u2019t like to win in that way, so it\u2019s like this, but sometimes Arsenal win in Burnley 1-0 with a hand, so sometimes it is like this. The way we like to play, we did it really well,\u201d he said. Guardiola was especially pleased with City\u2019s start to November given how poorly they fared 12 months ago. \u201cOur main problem last season was November, we had four games, three at home and were not able to win any,\u201d the City manager said. \u201cToday we won and hopefully we can keep that level in the next months. \u201cAfter a Champions League game [the 4-2 win at Napoli] it is always complicated. The last nine times we play against Arsenal, we won just once. Well done, well deserved. We played better. \u201cIn the first half, with the chances we created, we could have scored the second and third goal. 1-0, 2-0 is always complicated. \u201cWe played really good and we found in the bad moments, when we were tired, that we were mentally stable. And that is why I am so pleased with the performance.\u201d City now have the international break and Guardiola said: \u201cWe cannot deny the last two months. We won all the games, in the Carabao Cup, in the Champions League, in the Premier League. To do it over two months is so difficult, so I am so happy.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
