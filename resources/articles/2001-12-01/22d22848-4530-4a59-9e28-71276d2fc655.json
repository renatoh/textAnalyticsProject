With people reluctant to fly, fearing repeat hijackings on this side of the Atlantic, it could have been the perfect opportunity for train companies to cash in. Having persuaded business travellers that train services were great, and with aeroplane journeys slowed down by growing air traffic control delays and increased security measures, they might have captured themselves a new chunk of the market permanently. Unfortunately, when the fall-off in air travel after 11 September hit the UK, the railways were already in a bad state both physically and organisationally. The potential for growth has not been realised. In fact, rail travel has not yet recovered from the setbacks resulting from the Hatfield crash just over a year ago that nearly closed down the network. Extra tickets for rail travel were sold in the few days after the 11 September attacks, but the business quickly died away again as fears of a repeat attack faded and it became clear the trains were nowhere near as reliable as they should be. In September the network was still struggling to return to the state it was in before the Hatfield crash exposed the fact that there was a nationwide problem with broken and cracked rails, previously undetected, which needed urgent attention. And within a month of the terrorist attacks, infrastructure giant Railtrack had been thrust into administration by the Government after it became clear that the company was in financial meltdown. The railways are still in chaos. Operators have repeatedly warned the Government that safety is going to be compromised unless the industry is sorted out quickly and the right investment put in. The future organisational structure is undecided. The network as it stands has been described as 'unsustainable' by Railtrack chief executive Steve Marshall because costs are soaring and time is running out. And many big projects to expand and modernise the railway seem further away from fruition than ever. In this climate, many business travellers are reluctant to switch to the train for long-distance travel. Business travel was on the rise before the Hatfield crash. The Association of Train Operating Companies (Atoc) reported that in early October 2000, just before the crash, numbers of passengers travelling on inter-city full fares - open return tickets usually favoured by business travellers in first or second class - were up by 25 per cent on the previous year. But in January 2001, inter-city business train travel was down by 34 per cent year-on-year. The network was crippled by 1,200 speed restrictions imposed to protect trains from damaged tracks - and vice versa - more than twice the number that had been in place before the Hatfield crash. The loss of passengers was hardly surprising. A train journey from London to York, which would normally take two hours, suddenly took five or more at weekends. By last October, inter-city journey times were back to their pre-Hatfield norms and some of the slump in full-fare train travel had been recovered. Speed restrictions now number 650 - more than the 550 before Hatfield, but less than the winter peak of 1,200. Railtrack's target is to get the total down to 500 by the end of March. But the anticipated post-11 September boom did not come about. Overall, business travel is still down on the railways. Atoc reported that in early October, full-fare inter-city travel was still 8 per cent down on the same period in 2000. That covers all the long-distance train companies, including Virgin, Great North Eastern Railway (GNER) and First Great Western. Virgin said its West Coast and Cross Country services had not seen a post-11 September boom. A spokesman for GNER agreed. 'We thought we might pick up some extra business from domestic air travel with people having to put up with longer check-in times, and so on, but it did not materialise. 'It may be the lingering effects of the speed restrictions after Hatfield, but the market is depressed. It seems that when many people stopped flying they just did not travel at all, rather than switching to the train.' He added that no company would want to use the 'cataclysmic events' of 11 September as an opportunity. Nevertheless, it is clearly not a good sign for Britain's railways that they have not, even by default, been able to appeal to a new generation of business travellers with fast, efficient services and competitive fares. Since privatisation, rail travel in the UK has boomed, however: it is up by a third to around a billion passenger journeys a year. The Government's 10 year target is to increase passenger numbers by a further 50 per cent and freight by 80 per cent. Many observers believe these targets are in jeopardy thanks to the current organisational chaos in the railways and the lack of a clear strategy and investment programme. With delays up a staggering 45 per cent since Railtrack collapsed, and dire warnings from operators and Railtrack executives about increasing risks to safety and performance, the signs are not good. A report earlier this month from the Government's top independent advisers, the Commission for Integrated Transport, put Britain at the bottom of the European transport league. Countries such as Germany, France, Holland, Spain, Italy and Scandinavia have consistently outdone the UK on strategic planning and investment in public transport - particularly railways - for decades. CFIT's report found that there are fewer rail passenger coaches per 1,000 people in the UK than anywhere else in Europe. Only Greece and the Netherlands have fewer train miles per head than Britain. Germany has one of the highest proportions of car ownership in Europe, yet cars are used for 81 per cent of journeys there while 9 per cent of them are made by rail. The UK has a much lower level of car ownership, but Britons use their cars for 87.5 per cent of journeys, with only 6 per cent are made by train. This is a reflection not only of lack of investment in the UK rail infrastructure and the chaos of what is generally agreed to have been a flawed privatisation, but also of the fact that Britain has some of the highest public transport fares in Europe, by far the highest rail fares, and a relatively low overall cost of motoring, despite the high duty on fuel). Advisers such as CFIT chairman Professor David Begg say this has swung the balance towards car dependency, pollution and congestion and away from buses and trains. He says the figures are 'depressing' news for Britain. 'We have fallen a generation behind the best in Europe in transport planning and investment. It is a mountain to climb,' he warned. But he added that rail could win its deserved share of business travel in future if the Government and industry stuck to their spending plans and commitments to focus on public transport."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
