Bedoya was investigating rightwing paramilitary death squads; on her way to an interview with an imprisoned militia leader in May 2000 she was abducted, drugged, gang-raped and tortured. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an interview, it was a trap,\u201d Bedoya said. \u201cIn my head there no timeline because so much was happening that I didn\u2019t even know where I was.\u201d In May, two of the men who attacked Bedoya were sentenced to decades in prison in a rare victory against impunity, but watchdogs have warned that threats and attacks on Colombian reporters are once again on the rise \u2013 particularly in isolated rural areas. Last year, the Bogot\u00e1-based Foundation for Press Freedom (or Flip) documented 477 attacks and threats against journalists, up 53% on 2017; three Colombian journalists were killed, up from one in 2017. A 2016 peace deal with the leftist rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) was supposed to usher in a peaceful chapter in Colombia, but violence still rages as dissident guerrilla factions and rightwing paramilitaries battle for control of territory once held by Farc. Activists and social leaders have been targeted at unprecedented levels: 702 have been murdered since the accord was signed, while 135 ex-combatants have also been killed. Meanwhile, Colombia\u2019s president, Iv\u00e1n Duque, has been accused of undermining the implementation of the accords, attacking the special reconciliatory tribunal it created and its provisions for rural development. This is against a backdrop of increasingly difficult territory for journalists. \u201cThis is particularly worrying as these are places where armed groups are most present and information is harder to access,\u201d said Flip\u2019s Pedro Vaca. \u201cIn Colombia there are few national media outlets, so local reporting becomes more vital, and attacks against one journalist lead to a culture of self-censorship.\u201d International media have also had their work impeded: the New York Times correspondent Nicholas Casey and photographer Federico R\u00edos Escobar were forced to leave the country after a revealing a military order that encouraged kill quotas for enemy combatants. Members of the governing Democratic Centre party attacked Casey on Twitter, with one senator, Mar\u00eda Fernanda Cabal, accusing him of having links to the rebels. When it emerged that respected local weekly Semana also had the scoop but decided not to publish it, one of the magazine\u2019s headline columnists, Daniel Coronell, criticised it in its own pages in late May. He was sacked later that week though later reinstated after a public outcry. When justice is served, it is painfully slow. Bedoya was left for dead after the May 2000 attack, but she was eventually forced to undertake her own investigation of the crime after the official inquiry went nowhere. \u201cThe authorities essentially didn\u2019t investigate for years,\u201d Bedoya said. \u201cSo after wanting to be alone, after wanting to kill myself, I had to do it myself.\u201d Nineteen years later, two former paramilitaries, Alejandro C\u00e1rdenas Orozco and Jes\u00fas Emiro Pereira Rivera, were finally sentenced in May to 40 and 30 years respectively for their roles in the attack. More than two dozen other suspects have not been charged. \u201cThat day people were congratulating me, but I decided to turn off my phone, stay off social media, and I shut myself in my house because I had nothing to celebrate,\u201d Bedoya said. During the trial, Bedoya was forced to recount her attack in a courtroom \u2013 in front of the perpetrators \u2013 something she described as \u201can ordeal as bad as everything else they did\u201d. \u201cThese charges came incredibly late, and they are only the start,\u201d said Vaca. \u201cThis ruling would not have been possible without the doggedness, the bravery and the leadership of Jineth Bedoya herself.\u201d Bedoya maintains that her work is still impeded. \u201cEven today, because I still receive threats, I have to travel with three bodyguards everywhere in an armoured car, and that\u2019s how I have to report,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat freedom of expression is that?\u201d Her prognosis for the country is similarly bleak. \u201cColombia is sliding backwards,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you see social leaders threatened, when you hear women threatened with rape if they don\u2019t shut up, when you see journalists attacked for not toeing the government line, it\u2019s heartbreaking. It shows we are turning our backs on elements of a peace we spent years building.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
