Councils keep a public register of licences issued to bookmakers. This work revealed in December 2013 that there were 9,343 active betting shop premise licences, including some licences at application or grant stage. The study claims that this is an increase of 288 licences over the previous estimates and is attributable to new shops. The Campaign for Fairer Gambling says: \"[This] does clearly indicate a surge in new betting shop openings during 2013. It also supports the projections made in Ladbrokes, William Hill, Coral and Paddy Power annual reports in 2012 of 250 new shop openings during 2013.\" A spokesman for Ladbrokes said the company would probably be closing 50 shops in the coming 12 months. The projections produced by the campaign use a mix of industry and regulatory data. The tables use an average density of 3.7 FOBTs in every shop - a figure derived from the regulator, the Gambling Commission. The campaign says that this is not unrealistic. Coral, who have a fifth of all betting shops, confirm in their annual report to September 2013 a FOBT density of 3.99, Ladbrokes to December 2013 a density of 3.96, and Paddy Power in their 2012 annual report a density of 3.97. The average profit per terminal (PPT) indicated by Gambling Commission statistics is \u00a3896 per week producing gross annual revenue per machine of \u00a346,592. Adrian Parkinson, a former gambling industry executive who ran betting shops, said he used industry data to estimate how profits vary in different parts of the country. A 15% reduction in the average PPT to \u00a3762 was factored in to shops located in Scotland, the north east, the north west, Yorkshire, Wales, East Midlands, West Midlands and eastern regions. However, Parkinson factored a 25% uplift to the average PPT to \u00a31,120 in the south-west and south-east regions. And there is a 33% uplift on the average PPT to \u00a31,192 in the London region. Paddy Power's 2012 annual report shows the company, with shops mostly in London, attaining a PPT of \u00a31,210 per week. Parkinson then had to make a judgment on what the profits from the machine represented. In the industry this is known as the margin. The Ladbrokes 2012 annual report recorded a FOBT margin of 3.48%. In their 2013 report this had risen to 3.62%. In Coral's 2013 annual report the company recorded a FOBT margin of 3.73%. For the purpose of this analysis, Parkinson says he used a margin of 3.55%. From this he calculated the gross gambling yield in each council and the amount gambled. The amount staked is a notional figure representing the pattern of continual staking and betting that any gambling activity will chart. However these figures do not give any indication of the cash inserted into the machines. This is known as the hold percentage or cash retention figure. In the US, casino roulette's hold percentage is about 15%. Tote Sport's 2008-9 FOBT margin of 3.16% produced a cash retention margin of 16.77%. Ladbrokes told the Guardian that this is about 18%. Because this figure is mathematically linked to the margin, Parkinson says that 19% is now being achieved on FOBTs. The headline figures estimated using this methodology for the 2013-14 period indicate \u00a38.6bn of cash inserted into FOBTs to commence/continue play, \u00a346.1bn total amount gambled (amount FOBT gamblers wagered) and \u00a31.6 bn gross gambling yield (amount lost by FOBT gamblers). The Association of British Bookmakers (ABB), which has used the same mapping as the campaigners, says that the work is based on averaging rather than real-time data. While it concedes that the work is reasonably sourced, the industry says that betting shops' revenue and players in richer areas are quantifiably different from those found in poorer regions in a way not captured by a \"rough analysis\". Neil Goulden, chair of the ABB, said that betting shops in wealthy areas are up to eight times more profitable than those in deprived regions. Player participation in richer zones is four times higher than in poorer parts. The industry says that there is a correlation but it is between betting shops and population density. \"We don't target deprived areas. We understand the angst caused by the clustering. However the propensity to put shops on high streets has not gone up. The population in those areas has gone up.\" More open data Data journalism and data visualisations from the Guardian Development and aid data \u2022 Search the world's global development data with our gateway Can you do more with this data? \u2022 Contact us at data@theguardian.com \u2022 Follow us on Twitter \u2022 Like us on Facebook"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
