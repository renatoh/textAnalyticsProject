According to Nielsen Book Australia, which tracks book sales nationally, the Australian market for books experienced a \u201csteep decline\u201d early in the year, but turned a corner over Easter and has been growing ever since. Adult fiction has done particularly well, with the firm noting a 13% rise in sales value in the year to mid-October. \u201cPeople have more time to read the books they had always wanted to, either from their own bookshelf or a bestseller they had never got around to buying,\u201d says HarperCollins chief executive Jim Demetriou, name-checking two of the company\u2019s titles \u2013 Trent Dalton\u2019s Boy Swallows Universe, and George RR Martin\u2019s Game of Thrones \u2013 as bestsellers. In contemporary fiction, Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens and the final instalment of Hilary Mantel\u2019s Wolf Hall trilogy, The Mirror &amp; the Light, have also been notable sellers. Bookshops are noticing trends too. During Brisbane\u2019s lockdown earlier in the year, Chris Oliver, owner of Little Bird Bookshop, saw a rise in the sales of Australian books. \u201cPeople have become interested in knowing their own city because they obviously aren\u2019t traveling internationally, and they couldn\u2019t even travel interstate, to a large extent.\u201d He also noticed a shift away from new releases towards classics. Anna MacDonald, a bookseller at the Paperback Bookshop in Melbourne\u2019s central business district, says one customer picked up six volumes of Proust at the beginning of the city\u2019s second lockdown. \u201cHe said in the first lockdown he\u2019d read Dostoevsky, and now in the second lockdown he was going to work his way through Proust.\u201d Staff there have been offering personalised recommendations to online customers based on books they have previously enjoyed. Since March, the store has posted books daily on its website and social media platforms. \u201cOne of the challenges for us during the lockdown has been to find ways of maintaining that personal relationship with customers,\u201d MacDonald says. \u201cSales have taken a pretty hard hit but we are still making enough to make ends meet.\u201d In non-fiction, Australians responded strongly to the global protests sparked by the Black Lives Matter movement in the US, with books including Stan Grant\u2019s Talking To My Country, Marcia Langton\u2019s Welcome To Country, and Bruce Pascoe\u2019s Dark Emu selling well. \u201cThat was really exciting to see Australian readers looking to books to inform and to guide them,\u201d says Louise Sherwin-Stark, CEO of Hachette Australia &amp; New Zealand, which publishes Me and White Supremacy by Layla Saad and So You Want To Talk About Race by Ijeoma Oluo. Books that offer practical ways of passing time have also sold well, including cookbooks, gardening and craft books, and a resurgence in adult colouring-in books. Bricks-and-mortar booksellers But while business is booming for online booksellers \u2013 Booktopia reported a 28% increase in sales in the 2020 financial year, driven substantially by Covid lockdowns \u2013 bricks and mortar stores have had an uneven year. In parts of the country now minimally affected by Covid-19 restrictions, physical bookshops are flourishing. \u201cIn small country towns, people have been tremendous in supporting local business,\u201d says Diana Johnston, a book buyer for independent franchise group Collins Booksellers. \u201cOur stores in the country have been doing exceptionally well.\u201d For Michael Roach at the Book Cellar in Campbell Town, Tasmania \u2013 a town of fewer than 1,000 people, located between Hobart and Launceston \u2013 the absence of international tourists since March has been countered by strong online sales. \u201cWe had our best ever week\u2019s trade when one particular book [Alice Irvine\u2019s Central Cookery Book] took off online and we were the main supplier of it,\u201d Roach says. But it\u2019s been a difficult period for Melbourne booksellers, particularly those affected by a drastic drop in foot traffic through the CBD. Johnson, from Collins Booksellers, also co-owns the beloved Hill of Content, where sales have been \u201cdecimated\u201d, she says. \u201cOur turnover has probably dropped by about 80%.\u201d The store is building its fledgling online business, which it launched in November last year. Johnston says that jobkeeper and the support from regular customers \u2013 some of whom have been frequenting the store for decades \u2013 have been lifelines, but she expects a lasting downturn in the coming months, as people continue to work from home and theatres remain shut. \u201cWe just have to adjust accordingly.\u201d Debut authors lose out \u201cBooksellers are really good at encouraging readers to try something they haven\u2019t tried before,\u201d says Sherwin-Stark, from Hachette. In the absence of personal recommendations, readers have returned to familiar favourites \u2013 Michael Robotham, Nick Earls and Jodi Picoult among them. Debut literary authors, for whom physical events are an important promotional tool, have had a tough year as a result, says Sherwin-Stark. And though virtual events have allowed authors to reach larger audiences, digital event fatigue has been a downside \u2013 which is why some publishers delayed the release of key titles to later in the year, in the hopes that in-person events would be possible by then. \u201cJane Harper, Trent Dalton, Andy Griffiths, Richard Flanagan \u2013 all of these people have published books in the last couple of weeks,\u201d says Sherwin-Stark, in an interview at the end of October. Dalton\u2019s All Our Shimmering Skies was delayed from June to October. \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing now is a hugely crowded market\u201d for publishers \u2013 but \u201cfor readers, the best Christmas of all time\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
