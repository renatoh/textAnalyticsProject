Bob Hawke is dead but his tribe gathered at the Opera House today to give his successors \u2013 both the prime minister and the leader of the opposition \u2013 a little advice: that change is possible, that policy matters and a better Australia is waiting. All we need is a leader who knows how to lead. So many of Hawke\u2019s ministers and advisers lining up at the microphone to give their advice \u2013 Kim Beazley AC, Ross Garnaut AC, Bill Kelty AC - looked so untouched by time they seemed ready to get back to work. Paul Keating was showing his age. He was near the end of the list. Many of us sat through the ceremony in the Concert Hall in the shadow of what Keating might say. What last barbs, what unforgettable lines would he deliver? But he showed superb tact. No dancing on this grave. He was cool, discreet and even official. The hard rule of delivering a great eulogy is to never talk about yourself. Keating almost \u2013 almost - got there. Ceremonies like this are, by their nature, little truces in political warfare. Faction enemies nattered in the foyers. Putting on a suit maybe helps. Everyone is better behaved. And for this day at least, they were all on a unity ticket: still alive. Many took the stairs one at a time. Few in this crowd seemed to know their way round the Opera House. Max Gillies was there, representing that band of Hawke impersonators of whom he was, without doubt, the cruelest and the best. We learnt a couple of things today about modern Australia. We\u2019re shy of the old word widow and no one stands anymore when the Governor-General comes into the room. For an hour and half, praise was heaped on Hawke\u2019s achievements. But right at the top \u2013 after Linda Burney\u2019s superb welcome to country \u2013 we faced one of the worst decisions of the 23rd prime minister: Advance Australia Fair. Couldn\u2019t Hawke have found something, anything, better than this? All these years on, we\u2019re still praising the continent-girting sea and the golden plains we\u2019re less than enthusiastic to share. If we can\u2019t fix the tune, can we fix the words? So how did the 30th PM go in farewelling Hawke? Not bad at all. Scott Morrison\u2019s speech was far better than OK and all his own work. He had an odd confession to make: he had barely met his famous predecessor. \u201cBob Hawke loved our country,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are a better country for it.\u201d We wait at great events like these for ovations that come out of the blue. They came for Medicare, for letting 40,000 Chinese stay here after Tiananmen Square, and for Nelson Mandela\u2019s gratitude for Hawke\u2019s role in ending apartheid. But the first outburst from the crowd came as Anthony Albanese recalled his leader saying of himself one day: \u201cWhy do I have credibility? Because I don\u2019t exude morality.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The praise kept coming: for knowing this country so profoundly, for running a cabinet of talents, for his powers of persuasion, for weathering the storms when things were not going so well. But from speaker after speaker, there was also this hint: Hawke up close could be terrifying. \u201cIt was not always easy,\u201d said Kelty. \u201cIt was not always kind.\u201d If, as Beazley hopes, Bob Hawke is now \u201cin the arms of a loving God\u201d, then the choice of music at this farewell was edging on blasphemy: The Hallelujah Chorus played by the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, sung by a chorus of hundreds and for a time up on the big screen conducted by Hawke himself. Looked at through political eyes, this anthem celebrates the hopes of any democratic leader: \u201cAnd he shall reign forever and ever, forever and ever, etc., Hallelujah!\u201d After the politicians came the family. In a beautiful and steely eulogy, his granddaughter, Sophie Taylor-Price, dedicated herself to the task Hawke had set her on almost as a child: saving the climate. It was a last, pitiless piece of advice for the 30th prime minister sitting in the front row. And then Blanche d\u2019Alpuget, the widow, stole the show. After doing all the polite chores, thanking everyone under the sun, at the point when this fine writer might have been expected to deliver some eloquent reflections, she lifted her arms and delivered a single line: \u201cLong live love.\u201d \u2022 David Marr is a Guardian Australia columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
