Fulham have returned to the Championship\u2019s top two, ousting Cardiff from the automatic places for 24 hours at least, with the rousing nature of this win an indication that their pursuit of promotion remains relentless. Millwall, outstanding themselves of late, had not lost in 17 league games. In the end even they appeared diminished. The south Londoners would leave the pitch with their fans applauding their efforts, and their own ambitions to reach the play-offs apparently unfazed by defeat with two games to play but their manager, Neil Harris admitted this had been a reality check. Fulham, now without a defeat in 22 league matches in a notoriously treacherous division, weathered the hosts\u2019 early storm and imposed themselves impressively after the break. They were untouchable at times. Few teams at this level can muster such a blend of zest and panache and much of their approach play was Premier League ready. The pace of their passing and fluid movement up-field would grace the top flight with Ryan Sessegnon, at 17 the Championship\u2019s player of the season, truly a a gem of which the elite have long heard talk. It was his instinctive dart and finish, pouncing for a 15th goal this term after an indecisive Jordan Archer had only parried Aleksandar Mitrovic\u2019s long-range shot, which set the tone 41 seconds into the second half. \u201cAfter that, we started to move better, finding more space,\u201d said the Fulham manager, Slavisa Jokanovic. \u201cIt was a brilliant second half.\u201d The Serb\u2019s own assessment of Sessegnon\u2019s display included a nudge towards Gareth Southgate. \u201cI believe Ryan can be there (at the World Cup),\u201d he added. \u201cBut, if not this time, then in two years in another big tournament.\u201d The teenager, the product of a fine academy, caught the eye but plenty excelled. Matthew Targett clipped the bar from distance. Mitrovic would thump in his team\u2019s third, and his 11th in his last 12 games on loan from Newcastle, after Tomas Kalas\u2019s run from deep, and Kevin McDonald, the unsung worker at the base of a dazzling midfield, would enjoy his own moment. With Millwall disoriented and the atmosphere momentarily deflated, he left George Saville on the floor and meandered inside to belt a shot which swerved viciously to pass inside Archer\u2019s post via the goalkeeper\u2019s fingertips. If the hosts could curse Archer\u2019s uncharacteristic errors, their own evening degenerated into frustration as the cautions mounted up and Tim Cahill appeared to floor Ryan Fredericks with an elbow. Harris had not seen that incident, on the far side of the pitch, but was clearly unimpressed by Andre Marriner\u2019s display on a rare outing in the second tier. \u201cHe did very well for the away team in the first half,\u201d said the Millwall manager, Saville having been denied an opening goal after Jed Wallace was penalised for a foul on Targett. \u201cIf I was the defender, I\u2019d probably want the foul. But it was 50:50. There was a lot of protection for Fulham, though. But, as the referee told me at half-time, he thought he\u2019d been \u2018excellent\u2019.\u201d Harris\u2019s team, too, had been excellent through that frenetic opening when their intensity knocked Fulham off their stride. Jake Cooper saw a powerful header turned on to the crossbar by Marcus Bettinelli from the game\u2019s first corner, with Tim Ream scrambling Wallace\u2019s close-range shot from the goalline. But the chances were not taken and, once Fulham found their rhythm, they proved more ruthless from the moment their hosts\u2019 tempo dipped even marginally. The lead from Cardiff is a slender two points and the Welsh club can reassert control against Nottingham Forest and Derby in the next four days, but the pressure is on them. Jokanovic suggested he would watch his rivals\u2019 game with Forest on Saturday evening \u201cif I don\u2019t find something more interesting to do\u201d. At present, as this game proved, there is little better than watching his own team in action."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
