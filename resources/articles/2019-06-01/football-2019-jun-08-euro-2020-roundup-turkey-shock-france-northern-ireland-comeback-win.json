Didier Deschamps was scathing about his side\u2019s performance. \u201cWhen you play like that on a collective level there\u2019s nothing positive to take from the game,\u201d France coach told broadcaster TF1. \u201cWe didn\u2019t play the way we should have against a team which played the way it likes to.\u201d After full-back Benjamin Pavard gave away a free-kick on the left in the 30th minute, Cengiz \u00dcnder whipped the ball to the far post where it was headed back across goal for defender Kaan Ayhan to nod powerfully past Hugo Lloris. \u00dcnder put Turkey further ahead 10 minutes later with a fine finish after Samuel Umtiti and Paul Pogba each lost the ball clumsily in quick succession. \u201cWe weren\u2019t present (and) that\u2019s what the highest level is all about, whether you\u2019re world champions or not,\u201d Deschamps said. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t show the right intentions you can\u2019t hope for anything.\u201d Turkey\u2019s win saw them leapfrog France at the top of Group H, while Johann Berg Gudmundsson\u2019s strike gave Iceland a 1-0 home win against Albania and an early Igor Armas goal secured a 1-0 victory for 10-man Moldova at home to Andorra. Goals from Leroy San\u00e9 and Marco Reus in Belarus were enough to clinch Germany a second win from their two matches so far in Group C. Northern Ireland stay top having survived a scare as substitutes Conor Washington and Josh Magennis scored to snatch a 2-1 win in Estonia after Konstantin Vassiljev put the hosts ahead with a free-kick. It looked like it would make the difference between the two sides as Northern Ireland\u2019s struggles in front of goal away from home continued, but Michael O\u2019Neill\u2019s men turned it around in Tallinn in the final 15 minutes. Washington struck first, cutting in from the left before firing in \u2013 perhaps with the help of a deflection off Magennis, who then got the slightest of touches to turn Jordan Jones\u2019 cross beyond the reach of Sergei Lepmets. World Cup runners-up Croatia maintained control of Group E and dealt Euro 2016 semi-finalists Wales a setback with a 2-1 win on a scorching afternoon in Osijek. A 17th-minute James Lawrence own goal and an Ivan Perisic strike at the start of the second half sealed Wales\u2019 fate before substitute David Brooks pulled one back. Willi Orban scored twice as Hungary won 3-1 in Azerbaijan in the group\u2019s other match. Belgium stayed on top of Group I after a routine 3-0 win at home to Kazakhstan through goals from Dries Mertens, Timothy Castagne and Romelu Lukaku. Artem Dzyuba scored four goals and Michele Cevoli two own-goals as Russia thumped San Marino in a 9-0 win, the side\u2019s biggest in the post-Soviet era, while Oliver Burke\u2019s 89th-minute strike got Scotland out of jail in a 2-1 win at home to Cyprus after Andy Robertson\u2019s screamer was cancelled out by Ioannis Kousoulos. In Group J, Italy ran out comfortable 3-0 winners in Greece to make it three wins from three. Nicol\u00f2 Barella, Lorenzo Insigne and Leonardo Bonucci were on target in the first half. Teemu Pukki scored twice as Finland sank Bosnia-Herzegovina 2-0 to move up to second spot, while Armenia ran out 3-0 winners against Liechtenstein."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
