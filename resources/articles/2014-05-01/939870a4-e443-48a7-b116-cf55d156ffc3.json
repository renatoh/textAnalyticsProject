The Saints had slipped from first to third in the Super League table with their first two defeats of the season against Wigan and Widnes over the Easter weekend, then went out of the Challenge Cup with a third loss in the space of eight days at Leeds in the fifth round. But a 50-0 rout of the Bulls means they have now scored 98 points in consecutive wins against Bradford and London, the two clubs who seem increasingly likely to drop to the Championship next season when the Super League is slimmed down from 14 teams to 12. Jon Wilkin scored two of Saints' nine tries without reply, Tommy Makinson gained his 14th of the season, and the Australian scrum-half Luke Walsh collected 18 points from a try and seven goals. But their coach Nathan Brown highlighted the performance of the England hooker James Roby in enthusiastic comments that suggested he believes the Saints are in good shape for a stiffer test against their local rivals Warrington in the last game of the Magic Weekend at Manchester City's Etihad Stadium next Sunday night. \"We had some people who I thought had their best games for a while and on the back of their efforts it brought Robes into the game,\" Brown said. \"He was superior, I felt, to anyone else on the field and that comes off the back of people working with him. \"We had about six kids on the field who have played only 10, 15 or 20 Super League games so the guys should feel really happy. We came here today after they had had two great wins against good teams and we had to work hard to get to where we did.\" As Brown remarked, the Bulls had hinted at a revival with consecutive home wins against Warrington in the league and the Catalans in the cup. But now they are eight points short of safety after Wakefield's surprise win at Widnes on Friday night, and their coach, Francis Cummins, agreed that the latest defeat had highlighted the lack of depth in their squad after the late withdrawals of Luke Gale and Manase Manuokafoa. Johnny Raper, the former Australia loose forward, led the tributes to his former team-mate Reg Gasnier after one of the game's all-time greats died in Sydney the day before his 75th birthday. \"He was a fighter,\" Raper said of the former St George centre, nicknamed Puff the Magic Dragon, whose 36 Test caps were a record for Australia until Mal Meninga broke it in 1992. There could be more grim news for the Australian game with the Sydney Morning Herald reporting that 17 members of Cronulla's 2011 squad, as well as up to 40 players from the Australian Rules club Essendon in the same year, are involved in investigations by Australia's sport anti-doping authority into illegal drug use."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
