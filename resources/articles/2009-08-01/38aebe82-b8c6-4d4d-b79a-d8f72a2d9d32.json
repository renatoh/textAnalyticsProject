The central defender had hernia surgery at the end of last season and he has played no part in the club's encouraging pre-season, as he has struggled with inflammation in the area. He went to the United States recently to see a specialist about the problem and Harry Redknapp, the Tottenham manager, said that the club were weighing up how best to confront it. Eventually, it was decided that the operation was the correct course of action. Tottenham have been reluctant to discuss when Woodgate might play again and although the player has enjoyed good fitness since his transfer from Middlesbrough to White Hart Lane in January 2008, he has a history of serious injury, most notably a back problem that wrecked his time at Real Madrid. Woodgate, like the club captain, Ledley King, has a special training regime that sometimes sees him sit out sessions. This has counted against him in his efforts to impress Fabio Capello and win a place in the England squad. Redknapp was already preparing to kick off the season against Liverpool at White Hart Lane on Sunday without Woodgate but now he knows that he may be without him for some weeks. With no sort of pre-season, Woodgate will have to play catch-up with his fitness. Another of Tottenham's centre-halves, Michael Dawson, has an Achilles injury and is likely to be out for two weeks and so Redknapp is expected to give S\u00e9bastien Bassong, his new signing from Newcastle United, his debut alongside King. Bassong does not have to serve a suspension for Tottenham for the red card that he received at the end of last season on duty for Newcastle. King has barely trained during the pre-season, but Redknapp pointed out that was not unusual. Bassong and King played together in the pre-season victory over Olympiakos last weekend."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
