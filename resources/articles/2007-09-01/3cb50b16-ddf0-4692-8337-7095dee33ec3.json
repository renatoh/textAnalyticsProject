Didier Drogba was livid yesterday, wondering how a manager who had brought unprecedented success to the club could be cast aside, principally because of a personality clash with the owner, Roman Abramovich. Frank Lampard and the captain, John Terry, also struggled to rationalise the turn of events. When the England internationals learned on Wednesday from Mourinho that he was leaving they both skipped the premiere of Blue Revolution, the documentary about the Abramovich era. The rest of the squad attended. Lampard has put on hold negotiations over a new contract until the end of the season, when he will have only 12 months left on his existing deal. He has never hidden his loyalty to Mourinho, the manager who helped him blossom into one of Europe's leading goalscoring midfielders. Lampard, who has been linked in the past with Barcelona, will become an enticing target in the next two transfer windows, when his value will drop significantly. Mourinho had a difference of opinion with Terry over the central defender's form and fitness of late but Terry remained behind his manager. Like his team-mates, he had sensed the friction between Mourinho and Abramovich but failed to make the connection between that and the team's recent indifferent results, the reason pinpointed by the club's official statement yesterday. Injuries to key players have arguably been the principal cause of the malaise. Thigh trouble has ruled out Ricardo Carvalho, also a central defender, and is affecting Lampard too, and Drogba has a knee problem. Lampard and Drogba are serious doubts for the visit to Manchester United on Sunday. Grant could not face a more difficult first match in charge. His appointment has surprised several players, who lack respect for his achievements. He is perceived as Abramovich's man, the Russian having brought him in as director of football in the summer. The challenge for Grant is to impose his ideas on a team of superstars."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
