Briefing journalists after prime minister\u2019s questions, in which Corbyn pressed Theresa May over the health service, the spokesman suggested both sides, Russia and Nato, had to share the blame for the recent souring of relations. Asked whether Labour supported the government\u2019s decision to send 800 troops to Estonia as part of a Nato taskforce, he said: \u201cJeremy has expressed concerns about that being one of the escalations of tensions that have taken place.\u201d Griffith, who has visited the troops in Estonia and had earlier used an interview with Forces TV to express staunch support for Nato, was said to be \u201cabsolutely furious\u201d about the remarks. In Griffith\u2019s interview, given hours earlier, she said: \u201cI think it\u2019s very, very, important that we now play a very strong role in Nato, particularly as we are leaving the European union. I think it\u2019s very important for Nato to be absolutely clear, following what has happened in Ukraine, that we are standing together as Nato nations and there is no way that we would tolerate any attack on any one of our member states.\u201d Usually regarded as an ally of Corbyn, Griffith was handed the post when Clive Lewis was moved to the business brief. In the briefing Corbyn\u2019s spokesman also said: \u201cJeremy has said repeatedly that he has lots of criticisms of the Russian government, both in relation to what has happened in the Middle East and domestically. But what we don\u2019t want to see is a ratcheting up of tensions between Russia and the west, as has been taking place. We want talks and engagement to wind down military tensions, particularly on the Russian/Nato border and in the Middle East.\u201d The spokesman also appeared to reopen an argument about whether Corbyn believed Nato members were bound to offer military support if a fellow member were attacked. Asked what would happen if, for example, Russia invaded Estonia, the spokesman said the appropriate response could fall short of military action. He said: \u201cArticle 5 [of the Nato treaty] means that if there is an attack on another Nato state there has to be a response by Nato members \u2013 it doesn\u2019t define what that response should be. In practice, if you see from the wording of the treaty, that can be a whole range of things. But what we\u2019re looking for is a reduction of tension and a negotiated engagement.\u201d Some Labour backbenchers also voiced unhappiness. The Ilford South MP, Mike Gapes, tweeted: \u201cLabour Attlee established Nato. Under Blair enlarged to Baltic States. Article 5 collective defence absolutely essential for all members.\u201d The fresh row came as Corbyn\u2019s team pronounced themselves pleased with his populist new-year relaunch, and said he would continue to promise radical action to tackle inequality in the coming weeks. Corbyn had raised the prospect of legislating for a \u201cmaximum wage\u201d, in apparently unscripted remarks during a radio interview Tuesday morning as part of a wave of media appearances. In a speech later in the day he floated other proposals, including using government contracts to encourage firms to limit the pay ratio between lowest-paid workers and chief executives. Some Labour MPs were left confused about his stance on the issue of immigration, on which his party is deeply divided. \u201cPeople are just in despair,\u201d said one sceptical backbencher after the leader appeared to retreat from plans to stress he had no objection to immigration controls. But Corbyn\u2019s advisers believe the details of party policy are less important to the public than the general idea that he is ready to challenge vested interests, and they hope his strong language on fat cat pay will play well. They draw a parallel between the pay ratio plans, and Ed Miliband\u2019s policy of a price freeze for energy suppliers, which was criticised by business leaders but which sent the message that Labour would be prepared to face down powerful corporations. \u201cIt opened up a debate, and the public had to respond,\u201d said one adviser. \u201cThe water cooler debate in the workplace will be \u2018that makes sense to me, it\u2019s about fairness\u2019.\u201d Corbyn\u2019s team hope to play up his unvarnished style and credentials as a political outsider to tap into voters\u2019 frustrations about mainstream politics."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
