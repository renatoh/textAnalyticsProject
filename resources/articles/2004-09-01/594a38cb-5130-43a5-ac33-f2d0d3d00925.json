Malcolm Hepworth, who had headed the business for seven years, left last week and a successor is being sought externally. The Co-op described the first six months of the financial year to July 24 as \"tough\" and warned that profits would not improve in the final six months. Martin Beaumont, chief executive of the parent Co-op group, admitted that the stores had failed to get enough produce on shelves, partly because of its computer systems. The number of Co-op stores, largely under the Welcome brand, has jumped from 600 to 1,800 over four years following the acquisition of Alldays, Balfours and Conveco. Sales stayed steady at \u00a31.8bn and profits fell to \u00a335.8m from \u00a361.6m. The Co-op group, which includes the stores, bank, insurer, funeral parlours, travel and chemist operations, suffered a fall in interim pre-tax profits from \u00a3226.6m to \u00a389.7m, in part because of a \u00a342.2m drop in the value of short-term investments in the insurance business. The group blamed the drop in performance of its stores on its own mistakes rather that the might of the big supermarkets. Tesco this week reported a sharp rise in interim profits. \"Our infrastructure and management systems have struggled to cope with the fast pace of our expansion in food retailing over recent years, and as a result we have not been able to respond to changing market conditions as rapidly as we expected,\" said Mr Beaumont. The Co-op had expected to feel some \"pain\" while integrating the stores, but \"our pain has been greater than expected\". He sought to distance the departure of Mr Hepworth from the poor performance of the stores. The group is paying its first \"divi\" since the 70s, of \u00a310 to each of its 1 million members, next month."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
