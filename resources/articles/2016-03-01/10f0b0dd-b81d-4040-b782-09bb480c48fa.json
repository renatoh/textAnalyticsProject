Until then De Bruyne had contributed 12 goals and 12 assists in an outstanding start to his career at the club, having joined from Wolfsburg in the summer. Before De Bruyne tore a knee ligament in the 3-1 victory against Everton on 27 January City had lost only once in the Premier League since early December. Yet in the six weeks following De Bruyne\u2019s injury Pellegrini\u2019s side have endured four defeats, including three in a row, two of which were in the league. Pellegrini said: \u201cIn the moment he was injured of course he was in a very good moment, making important things. It\u2019s always important to play with your best players, especially when those players are playing all the games so they are 100% fit in their football performance. \u201cThat was the moment for Kevin and unfortunately for him and for the team he couldn\u2019t continue. Now I hope for the last two months of the season he can return as soon as he can to that performance in that moment because he was a very important player.\u201d Pellegrini hopes he can finally play De Bruyne with David Silva when both are in good form. \u201cThe most important thing is to have them all together in a good moment,\u201d said the manager. \u201cNot just one of the players. If we can link Kevin and David in the same moment with their best performance this will be a very different team. We couldn\u2019t do it because when David was very good, Kevin was not 100% fit. Now things change. I hope for the last part of the season we will see both of them in their best moment again.\u201d De Bruyne is expected back at the start of next month and will not join up with Belgium during the international break at the end of March. \u201cKevin will stay here,\u201d said Pellegrini. \u201cHe\u2019s not able to play a game with his national squad. Maybe he and Samir Nasri [who has a hamstring problem] will play and I hope Fabian Delph [calf] will play one or two games with the under-21s to maximise that period of time so when the squad return they will have played at least two games.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
