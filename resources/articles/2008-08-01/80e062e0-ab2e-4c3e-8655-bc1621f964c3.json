Then Brian Logan introduces the hotly anticipated Edinburgh debut of The Guardian: the Mueslical! performed by Craig Hill, Stephen K Amos, Chris Green, Lucy Porter and Tim Minchin. You can read his account of it here. The podcast is recorded in front of a live studio audience every day at noon - if you're in Edinburgh for the festival, we'd love to see you there. Tickets are free, and can be reserved by calling the Gilded Balloon box office on 0131-668 1633. More details on the venue's website.
