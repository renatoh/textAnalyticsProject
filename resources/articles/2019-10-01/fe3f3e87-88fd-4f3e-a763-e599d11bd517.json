The framework is part of a new voluntary code on degree classifications, designed to address fears that universities have been guilty of inflating grades. The code also calls for universities to display detailed figures on the degree classes awarded, and explain any changes in the proportions awarded. While students awarded first-class degrees will need \u201cadvanced knowledge\u201d and \u201cexceptional\u201d performances, those awarded 2.1s will need to be \u201cthorough\u201d and those with a 2.2 will merely be \u201cstrong\u201d. Those students who achieve a third will only \u201cdemonstrate\u201d skills without adjectives. University leaders said the effort would assure graduates and employers that the recent surge in the proportion of degrees awarded first-class and upper second-class (2.1) honours was justified, while still protecting institutional autonomy. Prof Julia Buckingham, the vice-chancellor of Brunel University and president of the Universities UK group, said: \u201cUniversities are listening to concerns about grade inflation and these initiatives show our determination to ensuring transparency and consistency in the way degrees are awarded.\u201d Buckingham said the public statements would detail each university\u2019s degree results as well as their criteria for achieving different grades, allowing them to explain increases \u201cin the context of improvements in teaching and students\u2019 performances\u201d. Earlier this year the Office for Students (OfS), the higher education regulator in England, sounded the alarm after its figures showed the proportion of students awarded first-class degrees shooting up from 16% in 2010-11 to 29% by 2017-18. The watchdog\u2019s analysis also found what it described as \u201cunexplained\u201d but statistically significant increases in the rate of first-class degrees awarded by almost all English universities. Surrey University increased the proportion of first-class degrees awarded to undergraduates from 23% in 2010-11 to 50% in 2016-17, falling back to 45% last year after the controversy over grade inflation broke. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, has been a stern critic of the increase in good degrees, accusing universities of having \u201centrenched\u201d grade inflation, and claiming that when he graduated in 1997, \u201cyou could count the number of students on my course who got firsts on one hand\u201d. He attended the University of Bradford, where the rate of first-class degrees awarded nearly tripled in seven years, from 11% in 2010-11 to 31% in 2016-17. Williamson said: \u201cI am clear that universities must end grade inflation and I will be watching closely to see if these initiatives do help to tackle the issue. I expect the Office for Students to challenge institutions which continue to record unexplained rises in top degrees awarded.\u201d The new code drawn up by the UK standing committee for quality assessment would only be voluntary, with no penalties for universities that refuse to take part. But Buckingham said Universities UK would be encouraging its members in England to publish the degree outcomes statements on their websites. David Kernohan, an analyst for the Wonkhe higher education thinktank, said the effort to boil down a complex set of algorithms and classifications into a brief text, as the code requires, was unrealistic. He said: \u201cIf you are setting out such broadly applicable descriptions you are in danger of not adding anything tangible to the subject specific learning goals and outcomes that already exist. \u201cWhat exactly do these non-exhaustive generic descriptors actually add? The idea of consistency in measures of learning is attractive, if unlikely. A mention of a provider\u2019s adherence to these descriptions in their degree outcomes statements seems to be the likely endpoint. And I\u2019m not sure who benefits from that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
