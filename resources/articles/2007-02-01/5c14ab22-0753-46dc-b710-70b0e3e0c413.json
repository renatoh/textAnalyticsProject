The bodies of skipper Rupert Saunders, 36, and crew members James Meaby, 36, and Jason Downer, 35, were found drowned at sea after their Sailfish 25 yacht the Ouzo vanished after they left the Isle of Wight for Devon. Michael Hubble, 61, a watch officer, was working aboard the P&amp;O car ferry the Pride of Bilbao, which was in the vicinity of the Ouzo at the time. Yesterday, he was charged with manslaughter of all three men due to gross negligence between August 20 and August 23 last year. Wearing a blue blazer, he spoke only to confirm his name, address and date of birth when he appeared before Portsmouth magistrates. Mr Hubble, of Folkestone, Kent, was granted unconditional bail to attend Winchester crown court for a preliminary hearing on February 16. Nick Hawkins, prosecuting, told the court: \"These matters refer to the tragic deaths of three yachtsmen on board the Ouzo which came into close proximity with the Pride of Bilbao.\" The hearing was told Mr Meaby and Mr Downer were found with life jackets manually inflated, while Mr Saunders, was wearing a life jacket which had automatically inflated. Postmortem examinations had showed that Mr Downer and Mr Saunders died from drowning, while Mr Meaby died from a combination of hypothermia and drowning."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
