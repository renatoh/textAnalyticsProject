A draft of the manifesto seen by the Guardian pledges that an unprecedented fourth-term Labour government would be \"bolder about the role of state intervention in markets\" and deliver sweeping constitutional change. Failing police forces could be taken over by their neighbours under one radical proposal. Brown's trip to the palace will trigger four weeks of frenetic campaigning and comes as a shock Guardian ICM poll suggests Labour is clawing back support from the Tories. The poll gives the Conservatives a four-point lead \u2013 much smaller than in other recent surveys, reflecting the volatility of the electorate. Brown will meet his cabinet for 45 minutes at 9.15am before driving to the palace to ask the Queen's permission to dissolve parliament. Previewing the message that will be at the heart of his election campaign, Brown said tonight: \"The people of this country have fought too hard to get Britain on the road to recovery to allow anybody to take us back on to the road to recession.\" Before launching his \"GB on the road campaign\", the prime minister will say the choice is between securing the recovery and a reckless Tory party that will derail it. He will insist that the Tories are alone in believing this year is the right time to cut \u00a36bn in government spending. David Cameron, the Tory leader, will counter by promising to fight for \"the great ignored\". For the Liberal Democrats, Nick Clegg will say: \"The election marks the beginning of the end of Brown.\" The draft manifesto, due to be put to a joint cabinet and national executive meeting on Wednesday evening, offers two dominant themes, of renewing the economy and establishing clearer citizens' rights and responsibilities. It is being stressed that the manifesto will offer progressive solutions for tough times, including reforms of public services that match Tony Blair at his boldest. New proposals contained in the draft, obtained by the Guardian, include: \u2022 Provisions for the management of inefficient police forces to be taken over by efficient forces. \"Where service is not good enough, it will be taken over by the best,\" the draft says. \u2022 Simultaneous referendums on a new voting system for the Commons and a 100% elected second chamber. \u2022 A national youth service alongside votes at 16. \u2022 Rights for football supporters to take over football clubs. \u2022 A living wage of \u00a37.60 in Whitehall, funded by a cap on the salaries of the most highly paid public sector employees. Cabinet-level discussions are also under way on a range of proposals including a cap on interest charged by credit card companies and a new review of competition law by the Office of Fair Trading. Brown's team promised his campaign will be distinguished by meetings in canteens, living rooms and town halls. The contrast at a personal level will be offered between the granite resilience of the PM and Cameron's \"plastic\" leadership. But the Conservatives, confident they have dealt a significant political blow by promising to cut national insurance contributions next year, believe they can pull off the biggest electoral swing since the 1930s and secure an overall majority. In a London marginal constituency, Cameron will say: \"We're fighting this election for the great ignored. Young, old, rich, poor, black, white, gay, straight. They start businesses, operate factories, teach our children, clean the streets, grow our food and keep us healthy \u2013 keep us safe. \"They work hard, pay their taxes, obey the law. They're good, decent people \u2013 they're the people of Britain and they just want a reason to believe that anything is still possible in our country. This election is about giving them that reason, giving them that hope.\" Clegg will travel to the three-way marginal seat of Watford. He will say that after \"13 years of dodging elections, despite being a key player in some of the most disastrous decisions, such as taking the country into an illegal war and a deep recession, [Brown] can't avoid going to the polls any longer\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
