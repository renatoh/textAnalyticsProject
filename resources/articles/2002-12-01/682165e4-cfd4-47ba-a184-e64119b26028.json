Farid Ahmadi, 33, his wife Feriba, 24, and children Hadia, seven, and Seear, four, were told that although they had been traumatised by their removal, it was \"proportionate\" to achieving \"effective immigration control\", lawyer Pierre Makhlouf said. Mr Makhlouf said the family was considering an appeal and added: \"They are absolutely distraught.\" In August, the family was removed from the UK to Germany - where they had made an initial asylum application - by order of the home secretary David Blunkett. However, in September, Mr Justice Scott Baker, in the high court, ruled that the move was unlawful, and said they had a right to appeal on human rights grounds. Mr Makhlouf said: \"We are very disappointed with the decision, but we believe that there are grounds for taking the case further. We believe that the decision is wrong in law, and [that] it cannot be just to affect immigration controls in a situation where a family such as this one will not be able to function normally. \"The future, particularly in relation to the eldest child, looks bleak,\" he added. During the legal battle the family claimed that they had been persecuted by the Taliban in Afghanistan. In 1995 Taliban forces, before coming to power, bombed both Mr Ahmadi's house and that of his father, who at the time was an army brigadier. Four years later, Mr Ahmadi was arrested and subjected to electric shock torture and beatings to the soles of his feet. The family fled Afghanistan in 2000, aiming ultimately for the UK. But the appeal hearing, in west London, was told that the couple were abandoned in Germany by a people-smuggler after travelling through Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Ukraine. They were arrested and placed in asylum camps for seven months where they faced racial and religious bigotry, the appeal hearing was told. During the hearing, in Hatton Cross, Mr Ahmadi admitted lying to the German authorities and later the UK authorities when the family fled to Dover. The hearing was told of claims by an official from an asylum camp in Bavaria, where the family stayed, that Mr Ahmadi refused to work while at the camp. Questions were also raised about Mr Ahmadi's true identity - an Afghan-issued army card was not consistent with the details he gave to German and UK officials. The Ahmadis sought sanctuary in a mosque in Lye, near Stourbridge, West Midlands, but police forced their way and arrested the couple in July. Mrs Ahmadi was said to be suicidal as a result of the deportation and Hadia suffered post-traumatic stress disorder. She was admitted to a psychiatric ward during the appeal hearing - conducted via video link from Germany - and has recently been suffering fits. Home office minister Beverley Hughes said she was pleased with the decision that the government had acted \"entirely within UK and international law\". \"As the adjudicator has found, the Ahmadis' case must properly be considered in Germany where they first claimed asylum. It cannot be right to allow people to use political asylum to shop around for the best deal in benefits or the most attractive place to settle or find a job,\" she said. The pressure group Committee to Defend Asylum seekers called the ruling \"barbaric\". A spokesman said: \"It is a deeply political ruling. They wanted to uphold immigration law before the human rights of the family.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
