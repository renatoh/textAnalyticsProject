It was a taunting question Yang\u2019s tormentors often asked him before they beat up the town\u2019s only Asian kid. Yang was an easy target. He was smaller and scrawny compared to his peers \u2013 something he couldn\u2019t help because he\u2019d skipped a grade to join them. Yang endured years of beatings, until he decided to take his aggressors\u2019 advice and train in a martial art. It took a few years, but by age 14, Yang was able to do something he hadn\u2019t before. He won a fight. \u201cSomeone picked a fight with me and I surprised them because I started to fight back,\u201d Yang told the Guardian. \u201cHe hit me first and didn\u2019t expect me to hit back. He seemed really surprised by the suddenness of it.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a long affair, but it ended with Yang having be pulled off his attacker by the other astonished schoolchildren. What does Yang\u2019s experience have to do with sports? For mixed martial arts, it turns out a whole lot. As an active campaign surrogate on the trail, Yang is reportedly high on Joe Biden\u2019s list of potential cabinet appointees should the former vice-president win Tuesday\u2019s presidential election. Depending on his placement, Yang believes he could get the Muhammed Ali Boxing Reform Act, which establishes federal protections for boxers, extended to MMA within the next two years. All MMA promotions would be affected by the new regulations, but none so much as the UFC, which enjoys a global lion\u2019s share of the sport\u2019s overall profits. Yang, who studied kung fu and competed in taekwondo through his early 20s, loves watching UFC fights. He got hooked on a reality show called The Ultimate Fighter in 2005 and was immediately drawn to it. The brainchild of the UFC, TUF is widely credited with introducing mixed martial arts to a new generation of fans who supported and sustained the new sport as it punched, kicked and choked its way into mainstream consciousness in the mid-2000s. Yang was among that crucial generation. He waxes about the first live TUF finale pitting Forrest Griffin against Stephan Bonnar \u2013 a barn-burner that became water-cooler fodder that Monday and convinced Spike TV to sign TUF up for a few more seasons. Yang even had his bachelor party at a UFC event in Las Vegas. As Yang\u2019s appreciation for MMA grew, so did his connection to the fighters and his curiosity as to how it all worked. Many state athletic commissions are required to provide a list of the fighters\u2019 purses. When Yang looked at one, his jaw dropped. The numbers just didn\u2019t add up. \u201cI admire the fighters, as they\u2019re disciplined in their training,\u201d Yang said. \u201cThey should not worry about making ends meet when they\u2019re one of the top fighters in the world.\u201d With data provided last year through discovery in an anti-trust lawsuit currently playing out against the UFC, it can be ascertained that anywhere from 10% to 18% of the UFC\u2019s total revenues go to the fighters, as opposed to the 50% athletes get in other major sports. It should be noted that these figures only reflect fighter pay through 2017. Today, more fighters are making million-dollar paydays \u2013 newly retired lightweight kingpin Khabib Nurmagomedov \u2013 made at least $3m (but probably closer to $10m) for his seven-minute destruction of Justin Gaethe at UFC 254 a week ago. Yet two other fighters on the same card took home purses closer to $13,500. Yang saw such a discrepancy in fighter pay that he included \u2018Empowering MMA Fighters\u2019 as one of his presidential campaign platforms. His plan was to bring federal regulation to MMA through the Ali Act, which was passed in 2000 to protect prizefighters from coercive contracts, among other fighter protections when dealing with promoters. \u201cThe Ali Act would fundamentally change the UFC\u2019s business model,\u201d wrote Erik Magraken, a managing partner of the British Columbia litigation firm MacIsaac &amp; Company, who has written extensively on the subject for combatsportslaw.com. \u201cThe door would be open for more competition from other promotions. Stars would enjoy market free agency far more frequently and open bidding from multiple promoters would be a reality. Many of the exploitative contract provisions the UFC has used to gain their position in the market would be prohibited.\u201d Currently, MMA fighters are widely signed to multi-fight contracts with lengthy duration terms. If a fighter is injured or turns down a bout for another reason, their contract freezes until they become active again. The UFC also has a liberal ability to cut a fighter at any time. \u201cThe UFC has such market prominence that they can treat their fighters, even stars, as replaceable cogs in the machine,\u201d wrote Magraken. \u201cThis option would largely be lost if the Ali Act was in place. Every prominent fighter would force the books to be open. Many fighters would take a stand.\u201d Free of long-term contracts, fighters would have the ability to negotiate one fight at a time and talent would likely spread more evenly across all the sport\u2019s promotions. The Ali Act would also address rankings. Unlike boxing, there are no independent organizations to rank the fighters, largely because the UFC hasn\u2019t agreed to work with one. The UFC provides its own rankings for the independent media to vote on, though a vast majority do not participate. Recently, welterweight Leon Edwards was abruptly cut from the UFC\u2019s rankings, because he wouldn\u2019t commit to any of the opponents presented to him. A few hours later Edwards had a new opponent and his name returned to the rankings within hours. \u201cPromoter-controlled titles would be eliminated,\u201d wrote Magakren. \u201cInstead, these would be overseen by outside sanctioning organizations. These organizations are regulated under the legislation with requirements for objective ranking criteria and other protection for the fighters \u2013 rank and title would become objective property rights of fighters. These could then be used when exploring and negotiating their market worth instead of tools of promotional control.\u201d Yang believes this will be a strong start, but federal regulation will be the first swing in a one-two combination. \u201cApplying the Ali Act would a big step forward, but to me, MMA fighters need either a union or pro association, so they can negotiate for a fairer share of the revenue stream,\u201d Yang said. \u201cBig changes need to happen, and I\u2019d like to do this on a human level.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
