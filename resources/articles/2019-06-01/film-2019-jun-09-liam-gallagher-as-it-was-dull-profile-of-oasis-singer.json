But as this plodding portrait, which follows Gallagher post-Oasis, is at pains to point out, he is a softy at heart who loves his mum and his kids. Yawn. Surely the whole point of Gallagher is that he\u2019s a raging maverick with no patience for industry spin, who thrives on grudges and who would never, ever, allow a director to play Ave Maria over a montage of a studio recording session."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
