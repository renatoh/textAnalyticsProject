It says much about the Fulham manager's application that, during a serious case of septicaemia which required more than a fortnight's hospitalisation, he was keeping hourly contact with his deputy Steve Kean. \"It was impossible to detach myself,\" said a relaxed Coleman, who returns for today's Premiership encounter with Leeds for the first time since the infection took hold on a metal pin in his leg 18 days ago. \"The doctors want you to take it easy, and I was lying down and resting, but my brain was still working overtime because that's the nature of the job. \"I spoke to Keano virtually hourly and he came to see me every day. Of course we were discussing the team and the club. I would much rather be down there on the touchline than lying down on a hospital bed not knowing what's happening. That was a killer. \"The atmosphere and the excitement, waking up on a Saturday morning with a big game - that's the best part of the job. This match can't come quick enough.\" Those words will dismay Coleman's wife. The Welshman admits he has recently spent more time in her company and that of their four children than in any period in the past six months. The illness did not spark the soul-searching that accompanied the car accident of three years ago. This time he was gnawed by his passion. \"When I had the accident three years ago and I was lying in hospital, things were put into perspective for me then,\" Coleman said. \"Football consumes my life - it always has done and it always will do. Of course the family comes first but my family are fine and that allows me to concentrate on football. I think about it 24 hours a day.\" Even in hospital. \"All I watched was football. I think I learnt more about Spanish football and Italian and German football when I was in hospital than I have all season,\" he said, admitting this might lead to a bid for a German international striker. \"That Miroslav Klose's not bad. We've watched him once or twice, but there's been no official bids or anything.\" Coleman was anxious to return but never worried. \"The most frightening part was that the antibiotics were churning my guts up and I hadn't been to the toilet for three days,\" he revealed. \"I was a bit worried they would have to take drastic measures.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
