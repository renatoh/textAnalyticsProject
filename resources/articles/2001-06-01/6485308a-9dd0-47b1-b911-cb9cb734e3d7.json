Beethoven's early Opus 18 No 4 was well chosen as an opening work: weighty but not emotionally overwhelming. Sadly, it never quite settled down, both outer movements suffering from roughness of intonation, tone and balance. The inner movements felt more comfortable: the scherzo was airy and graceful, the minuet and trio delicate. But even leaving untidiness aside, the Sorrels did not quite rise to the quartet's shades of tone and character; despite much surface activity, it never came to life. Performing a work so weighed down by extra-musical association as Shostakovich's \"autobiographical\" Eighth Quartet can place a heavy burden on musicians' shoulders. Just how stifling this burden can be was demonstrated in the Sorrel's heavy-handed interpretation of the second and fourth movements. The Allegro's whirlwind opening theme was absurdly distorted by exaggerated pressure, and the Largo's violent repeated chords similarly acquired several extra notes. Yet there was some fine playing here, too; the poignant medley of quotations in the fourth movement reached a climax with the cello's heartrending solo, which was played with a well-balanced vulnerability. Music as tragic as this can very easily be spoiled by overinterpretation: the Sorrels were at their best simply playing beautifully. With Mendelssohn's effervescent D major Quartet, the Sorrels seemed to open out and begin to enjoy themselves. Their distinctive voice, swamped before, emerged gratefully. The problems of intonation and balance that had marred the Beethoven were nowhere in evidence here; each detail was fine-tuned to perfection. From the elegance of the slow movement to the joie de vivre of the finale, this was the work that brought out the best of the quartet's playing. An encore can, at its best, be the most memorable part of a concert. At its worst, it can spoil the impact of a fine performance, as happened here. The audience barely had time to digest the Mendelssohn when the Sorrels launched into Suk's Barcarolle, drowning Mendelssohn's sparkle with schmaltz."}, "isHosted": false}}}
