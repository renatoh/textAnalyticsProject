Mama Rosin made it clear last year that they were looking for new musical directions when they recorded with the London rockabilly veterans Hipbone Slim and the Knee Tremblers, and now they have made their most intriguing and experimental album to date. The recording is often rough and raw, and veers between rumbling garage-rock and bayou styles, with the melodeon and fiddle work of Cyril Yeterian matched against the guitars and banjo of Robin Girod, with clanking effects or distorted vocals added in. There is still a cajun edge to many of the songs, but now mixed in with a hefty dose of rock and blues, as on furious and raucous You Broke My Stuff, or the slow and slinky Mama Don't, which builds to an insistent riff with echoes of the Velvet Underground. They are a great live band, so their forthcoming tour supporting Bellowhead should be quite a party."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
