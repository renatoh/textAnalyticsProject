While all but a few sports leagues around the world have shut down during the pandemic, White has insisted he wants UFC 249, scheduled for 18 April, to go ahead. The event was supposed to be headlined by undefeated lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov against Tony Ferguson. However, Nurmagomedov said he would not leave quarantine in Russia to fight, possibly due to the fact that he may have trouble entering the US during the Covid-19 lockdown. Ferguson will now face Justin Gaethje, although White said a private island could help fighters having trouble entering the US. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you this, I\u2019m this close to getting a deal done,\u201d White said. \u201cSo, this place where this fight is going to be on 18 April, I have locked up for two months, so I\u2019m going to continue to pump fights out. I also secured an island. I\u2019ve got an island. The infrastructure is being built right now. We\u2019re going to do all of our international fights on this island. \u201cSo, when we do this fight 18 April, international and in the United States, we\u2019re going to start cranking. The UFC will be back up and running, internationally and here in the States.\u201d There will be no live audience at UFC 249 and White did not name the island he plans to use as a venue. \u201cHealth and safety is something we worry about all the time, not just during the coronavirus,\u201d White said. \u201cObviously, this has made our jobs a little tougher, but we\u2019re going to do everything above and beyond to make sure everybody is safe, just we always do. A lot of things will be different.\u201d White did not specify whether fighters would be tested for Covid-19 before competing. \u201cI\u2019m ready to get back,\u201d White said. \u201cYou keep people in their houses for too long without entertainment, people are going to start losing their minds. And we need to start figuring out solutions. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re going to keep everyone safe and we\u2019re going to pull this thing off.\u201d White\u2019s plan is not dissimilar to one proposed for Australia\u2019s NRL. The rugby league competition is considering plans to host the entire season on an island 40km off the coast of Queensland."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
