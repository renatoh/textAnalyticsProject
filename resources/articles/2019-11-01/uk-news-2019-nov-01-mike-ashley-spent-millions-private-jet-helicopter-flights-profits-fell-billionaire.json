The Sports Direct owner\u2019s family also received more than \u00a3100,000 of hospitality at Newcastle United, Ashley\u2019s football club. Ashley\u2019s spending was revealed in the annual accounts for Mash Holdings, through which the billionaire owns his businesses. Mash\u2019s revenue rose to \u00a33.5bn in the year to April 2018 from \u00a33.3bn a year earlier. But profits fell to \u00a320.9m from \u00a3102m as profit on the sale of Dunlop and JD Sports shares in 2017 was not repeated. Ashley also suffered a \u00a376m writedown on his investment in Debenhams. Ashley has failed in his attempts to overturn a compulsory voluntary arrangement at Debenhams after the department store chain went into administration, wiping out the near 30% stake owned by Sports Direct. The latest accounts show Ashley\u2019s spending on \u201cuse of the company jet and helicopter\u201d tripled to \u00a32.1m and his family were treated to \u00a3113,000 of matchday hospitality at Newcastle, up from \u00a378,000 a year earlier. Ashley has defended his use of the plane and helicopter, which he has boarded to leave Sports Direct annual meetings in the past. \u201cI do fly to work by helicopter,\u2019 he told the BBC three years ago. \u201cI don\u2019t get paid a salary but I do like to go by private plane. It saves a lot of time and is very efficient.\u201d The accounts set out Ashley\u2019s retail spending spree during the year, including the purchases of House of Fraser for \u00a390m, Evans Cycles for \u00a38m, Jack Wills for \u00a312.8m and a shopping park in Hertfordshire for \u00a325.4m. Ashley\u2019s splurge on retail assets has raised eyebrows with some analysts questioning his moves to buy up ailing businesses with the high street under pressure. The accounts for the current year are likely to be hit by the disastrous performance of House of Fraser, which he revealed was losing \u00a31m a week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
