The Leonids will peak in the hours between midnight and dawn on 18 November. They are so-called because they herald from a point in the constellation Leo \u2013 the lion. Known as the radiant, this point is located just below Leo\u2019s head, a grouping of stars sometimes referred to as the sickle. Somewhere between 10 and 15 bright meteors an hour can be expected in a typical year. However, light from a waning gibbous moon situated close to the radiant this year could mask a few of the fainter shooting stars from view. The meteors themselves are little more than specks of dust that have been ejected by comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle. For those who want to practise their meteor watching, a less active shower, called the Taurids, will peak in the early hours of 12 November. As the name suggests, they will radiate from the constellation of Taurus \u2013 the bull."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
