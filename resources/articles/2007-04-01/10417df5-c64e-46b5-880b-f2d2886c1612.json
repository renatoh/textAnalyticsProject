Last year's elections brought Viktor Yanukovych - Yushchenko's nemesis during the rigged presidential elections of 2004 which led to the country's so-called Orange Revolution - to power as prime minister at the head of a coalition government. Yushchenko's party, Our Ukraine, meanwhile straddled government and opposition, while his close collaborator during the Orange Revolution, Yuliya Tymoshenko, went into opposition and campaigned for new elections. The complex power-sharing arrangement that emerged resulted in a power struggle between government and president, which the government, backed by the parliament, had been winning. But while Russia welcomed the Russophile government's newly dominant position, elements in the west feared the strong parliament would undermine Yushchenko's pro-western foreign policy. For Yushchenko, the attempted coup is a means to recover some lost power from parliament. For his western backers, it is a way of irreversibly locking Ukraine into western geopolitical and geo-economic structures. The president has resorted to such a high stakes gamble because of his domestic political weakness. Even if the constitutional court rules in his favour, early parliamentary elections will almost certainly result in his party winning fewer seats than they did last year. Our Ukraine, with its neoliberal and pro-western outlook, came a poor third place, drawing support mainly in the west and centre of the country. Should new elections take place, the largest party is likely once again to be Yanukovych's Party of the Regions, a corporatist party which polled 32% last year, mainly in the Russian-speaking east and south of the country. Of the major parties only former prime minister Yuliya Tymoshenko's parliamentary bloc, with its pragmatic populism and strong pro-western outlook, can expect an increased share of the vote. Since the Yanukovych government was formed last summer, Ukraine has begun to be the author of its own democratic future. The power struggle has been a contest for the right to consolidate the state bureaucracy and the political system to enable strong and effective government. This has been accompanied by a booming economy and a pragmatic foreign policy that combines cooperation with Russia with closer integration with the EU - but not with the unpopular Nato. Consolidation of the state and political system is a necessary prerequisite, not only for further political and economic reform but also for Ukraine to withstand geopolitical pressure and economic competition from east and west. Russia wants to establish a consortium with Ukraine to jointly own and manage the pipeline network that takes Russian gas to the EU, while Russian business has been seeking to acquire large Ukrainian businesses. For its part, the west would like Ukraine to adopt neoliberal economic reform, join Nato and deepen its relationship with the EU as a bulwark against a reinvigorated Russia. Should large parts of the political and economic elite, and the country at large, regard early elections as illegitimate and boycott them, Yushchenko and his renewed ally Tymoshenko would be unable to negotiate any form of political compromise, weakening Ukraine's ability to withstand external pressure. A combined political and legal solution preventing the need for early elections is more likely to emerge. Yushchenko and Tymoshenko, who led the street protests during the Orange Revolution, have morphed into counter-revolutionaries, intent on crushing the parliament they ensured was elected in Ukraine's freest and fairest elections since independence. Their western backers, with their own geopolitical agenda, hope neither will emerge as Ukraine's equivalent of Boris Yeltsin and that the international community will not notice their improbable reincarnation. Paradoxically Yushchenko has returned to the failed authoritarianism of the past, and jeopardised not only his but also his country's democratic future. In so doing he has renounced his right as heir to the Orange Revolution and transformed Yanukovych into an unlikely defender of Ukrainian democracy. \u00b7 Adam Swain is a lecturer in geography at the University of Nottingham.
