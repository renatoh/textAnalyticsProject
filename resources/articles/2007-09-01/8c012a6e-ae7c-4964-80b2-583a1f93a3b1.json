Nobody blows a jazz solo here, however, and Herbert's originals (all the pieces are hers) connect more with Janis Ian or Rufus Wainwright than the standards the subtly intelligent Herbert at first seemed destined for. Jazzers might be foxed by Blue Note's endorsement of this low-key, folk-inflected and very personal vision, but the production by Polar Bear's Seb Rochford matches the accompaniment of Acoustic Ladyland pianist Tom Cawley, guitarist Mike Outram and others to the singer's sensibilities, and the lyrics gleam with individuality. Herbert's broad listening surfaces in hints (the countermelody of Morning After glances off the Beatles' Lady Madonna, hushed reggae appears in Slow Down Brother) and though the tunes could have used a few more twists and turns, it confirms that Herbert is light years from the whisper-in-your-ear Krall clone some dismissed her as."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
