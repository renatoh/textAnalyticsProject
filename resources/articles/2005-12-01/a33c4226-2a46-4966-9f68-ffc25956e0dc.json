Other foreigners risk expulsion, he said in a television interview in which he backed calls to punish rappers whose songs were deemed to incite hatred among youths living on the margins of society. He said 83 foreigners had been arrested, but 40 could not be deported because of their age, refugee status or the length of time they had spent in France. \"Seven proceedings are finishing up,\" he said, and they were \"likely\" to be expelled."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
