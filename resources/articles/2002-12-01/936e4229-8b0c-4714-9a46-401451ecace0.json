The Movement for Democratic Change has led calls for Zimbabwe's matches to be moved to South Africa in protest at President Robert Mugabe's policies. Mugabe retained power earlier this year in a discredited election marred by intimidation and political violence, and his land-reform policies have been cited by the United Nations as a factor in the looming famine that could affect five million people. \"By agreeing to stage the World Cup in Zimbabwe, despite the humanitarian crisis and unprecedented levels of institutionalised violence, the ICC are sending a callous message to the people of Zimbabwe,\" said Paul Themba Nyathi, an MDC spokesman. \"Not only have they demonstrated indifference to the pain and suffering of hundreds of thousands of innocent people, they are also, albeit inadvertently, sending a message of hope to the despotic Mugabe regime. \"We urge all cricketers scheduled to play in Zimbabwe to follow their consciences and refuse to play. If the ICC is unable to protect and defend the image of cricket then it is up to the players themselves to do so.\" Announcing the decision at Lord's, the ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said that following a fact-finding mission this year, the governing body was content the safety and security of players and officials would be guaranteed. Speed repeatedly stressed that, despite calls from government and opposition politicians in the UK for the ICC to consider the wider political and humanitarian context, the decision was based solely on security grounds. \"The ICC is a cricket organisation, not a political institution,\" he said. \"It makes decisions on what is in the best interests of cricket. It doesn't make political decisions on political issues. Zimbabwe is one of the 10 full members of the ICC and has earned the right to host matches.\" Tim Lamb, the England and Wales Cricket Board's chief executive, echoed Speed's comments: \"As a national governing body for sport, the ECB do not consider it appropriate to make political judgments about the acceptability or otherwise of foreign governments. The government has not asked us to withdraw - we have been left to make the decision ourselves.\" He added that 300 British businesses operate in Zimbabwe, including BP/Shell, Barclays and British Airways, that there is no general sporting boycott and only limited EU sanctions. The sports minister Richard Caborn confirmed the decision was left to the ICC. \"We have offered them all the assistance they asked for, but in the end the ICC is the governing body and it has to be content that it's OK to play cricket there.\" The ECB declined to be drawn on what would happen to England players who did not want to travel to Zimbabwe. A source said the players' primary concern was security, but there is a precedent for players ignoring the ECB's advice. Last winter several declined to travel to India in the wake of September 11 despite assurances that it was safe to do so. Speed has left open the possibility that the matches would be moved if the situation deteriorates. \"We all know that Zimbabwe is a troubled country,\" he said. \"The ICC will continue to monitor events and if there is a deterioration in the situation we will reconsider. If it becomes too dangerous we will relocate the matches to South Africa.\" Speed tried to play down fears that Mugabe, who is patron of the Zimbabwe Cricket Union, would attempt to use the event for political gain. \"I don't know whether Mr Mugabe will play a role,\" he said. \"I've been to cricket in Zimbabwe on several occasions and Mr Mugabe hasn't been there. I certainly hope that it is not used as a political vehicle.\" The ICC has not, however, received assurances that journalists will be offered unfettered access to the country. The Mugabe regime is hugely sensitive to media criticism and the BBC is barred from operating in the country. \"We are not going to get through the tournament without trouble with journalists, let's be honest,\" said Speed. \"If people are accredited to write about cricket it's OK. If they want to go beyond that it's beyond our control and it becomes a political issue.\" Michael Ancram, the shadow foreign secretary, said he would be writing to the ECB urging it to consider a unilateral boycott. \"I find the ICC's decision a denial of human values in the light of the atrocities in Zimbabwe,\" he said. \"I regret it very much as I believe this decision risks debasing the great game of cricket by associating it with an evil, murderous dictator like Mugabe.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
