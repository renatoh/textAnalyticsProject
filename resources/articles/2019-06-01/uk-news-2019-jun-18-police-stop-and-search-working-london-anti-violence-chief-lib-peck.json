Lib Peck, the former leader of Lambeth council who was appointed to the role in January, made the comments while on a two-day fact-finding trip to Glasgow, visiting some of the Scottish unit\u2019s key projects and meeting senior officials. Set up in 2005, Glasgow\u2019s VRU famously treated violence as a public health issue and reduced stabbing deaths while unravelling the deeply rooted gang culture in a city which at the time had the second highest murder rate in western Europe. Responding to the recent wave of violence that left four people dead in the capital, Peck said: \u201cIt does mean people feel a bit hopeless about the situation that we\u2019re in and feel incredibly sad and powerless. But what we also know is that we\u2019ve got to do things differently. To that extent the London VRU is copying some of the work that the Glasgow VRU is doing and looking at things in a much longer term perspective.\u201d Peck said new stop and search powers have been successful after a five-fold increase in their use over the past year. At the beginning of June, the Metropolitan police deputy commissioner, Sir Steve House, told the London assembly police and crime committee that the number of stop and searches under section 60 powers, which allow the police to search people in a designated area without suspicion, had increased from 1,836 in 2017-18 to 9,599 in 2018-19. House faced criticism in his previous role at head of Police Scotland in 2015, when figures emerged showing excessive use of informal powers to search people, including tens of thousands of children, without any evidence they had committed a crime. Independent monitoring has found that stop and search powers disproportionately target black people. Peck said: \u201cThere\u2019s a combination of enforcement as well as long term prevention work that has to go hand in hand. Stop and search has been successful in terms of the numbers of weapons it has revealed, and it is worth noting that violence has started to come down in London not that there\u2019s any complacency around that.\u201d She added: \u201cI do think there is something around making sure you\u2019ve got the trust of communities who are absolutely critical to successful violence prevention work. And you\u2019ve got to be very aware of the impact of stop and search on those communities\u201d. The co-founders of Scotland\u2019s VRU have previously described the benefits of their arms-length relationship with politicians, and of being able to start their work away from the media glare. Accepting that the intensity of public, political and media scrutiny around knife crime in London makes her role very different, Peck said: \u201cIt makes it more difficult but I do think it\u2019s all about building confidence in what we\u2019re trying to do. There are huge number of organisations across London doing schemes which are making a positive difference. There is a huge appetite from the public not to see violence become the norm, as there is across the whole of England, it\u2019s not just a London phenomenon.\u201d Peck\u2019s visit took place as the home secretary, Sajid Javid, announced he was giving \u00a335m from the \u00a3100m serious violence fund announced by the government in March to police and crime commissioners in 18 local areas to set up their own local violence reduction units. Niven Rennie, director of Scotland\u2019s VRU acknowledged that stop and search was \u201can emotive issue\u201d in London and emphasised the need for local engagement to avoid the situation where \u201cpeople think they are being searched for the sake of it because they happen to be black\u201d. He added that a key element of the VRU\u2019s early work in Glasgow was \u201cyou can\u2019t have enforcement without search\u201d. \u201cWhat I say to Lib and her colleagues is that you have to stop people dying before you can start making improvements, and then prevention comes after that.\u201d While Scotland\u2019s VRU has no official affiliation with the London unit, its team regularly hosts visits from other parts of the UK and beyond. Rennie said: \u201cWhen I go down south I get all the time \u2018it\u2019s different down here, it\u2019s drugs and race, but if you raise it up to strategic level it\u2019s poverty and exclusion. All the social factors that you associate with city present in violence. If we get tied up with the differences, we won\u2019t make much progress.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
