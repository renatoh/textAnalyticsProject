On Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership of the Labour party \u201cI suspect that there are many members on the Opposition benches who might be familiar with an \u2018unscrupulous boss\u2019. A boss who doesn\u2019t listen to his workers. A boss who requires some of his workers to double their workload. Maybe even a boss who exploits the rules to further his own career. Remind him of anybody?\u201d On Corbyn\u2019s claim that the government no longer had its long-term economic plan He calls it austerity. I call it living within our means. He talks about austerity, but it is actually not about saddling our children and grandchildren with debt. On the length of the Labour leadership contest I look forward to the exchanges he and I will have and I hope we will be having those exchanges over the despatch box for many years to come. On becoming the second female prime minister In my years here in this House I have long heard the Labour party asking what the Conservative party does for women. Just keeps making us prime minister. On the divisions after the EU referendum The Labour party might be about to spend several months fighting and tearing itself apart, the Conservative party will be spending those months bringing this country back together. To Tim Farron, on when they both stood against each other as candidates in North West Durham in 1992 Little did voters know that the two unsuccessful candidates in that election would become leaders of political parties. Although as I would point out to the honourable gentleman. My party\u2019s a little bit bigger than his!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
