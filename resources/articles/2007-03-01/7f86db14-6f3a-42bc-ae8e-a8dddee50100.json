Dr Abid Thyab al-Ajeeli is both. But Iraq's minister for higher education and scientific research says protection from scores of security guards is not for him. Instead he cheats death by travelling in disguise. \"I go from one town to another in sportswear or Arabic headdress,\" he says. The minister, with a PhD in software engineering from Keele University, has the courage and demeanour of an army general. In November, Thyab announced his \"temporary resignation\" from the government in protest at a mass kidnapping of employees at a higher education ministry building in central Baghdad by gunmen reportedly dressed in police uniforms. The Sunni-led Iraqi Islamic party controls the higher education ministry and Shia militias are said to have infiltrated the police. The raid, in the relatively stable district of Kerrada, was the largest-scale abduction since the 2003 US-led invasion. \"How can I ask our employees to go to their offices?\" Thyab said to parliament. \"There is no option in front of me other than to stop education in Baghdad.\" He later told reporters that he had not ordered an immediate shutdown of universities, but would consider it \"if things go on in this way\". Thyab was an academic for more than 20 years in Jordan and Qatar before taking office in May 2005. He says that during the Saddam era it was as if Iraqis had \"a bullet under their tongue - they couldn't speak\". Now, he says, that bullet is trained on their ear and they dare not listen to some of the horrors going on around them. He does dare, and is intent on changing the situation, at least as far as higher education is concerned. Thyab, a Sunni Muslim, wants to secularise Iraq's 20 major public universities, its two postgraduate commissions and its 43 technical institutes and colleges. He says Iraq's security and its higher education would be much improved if religious and political groups were prevented from recruiting university students. He intends to stop \"outsiders\" putting up political or religious pictures, distributing propaganda and giving lectures at universities. He would even prefer Christian candidates over Muslims for university presidents. \"We are trying to prevent religious groups influencing and recruiting students,\" he says. \"I have asked university administrations, for example, deans and presidents, not to allow anyone from outside to hold a lecture or to try to put up pictures relating to anything religious, or to political parties. They must speak instead of the unity of Iraq, of what unites Iraqis. Penalties \"I am going to instigate penalties. We will reduce the support and funding, and try to change the president if a university does not [comply]. I'm really trying to appoint university presidents who don't belong to a political party. If they bring two candidates to me, and one is a Muslim and one a Christian, I would think that the Muslim, Sunni or Shia, might be influenced by political parties. I'm looking for the people who don't believe in religion. \"From the first day I got this job, I felt that this was the way.\" There is no doubt that drastic measures need to be taken. In October, Professor Kadhim al-Rawi, who was head of the University Professors' Union and had highlighted the dangers on Iraq's campuses, was shot outside his home. A month later, a Baghdad University dean, Jassim al-Asadi, a Shia, was returning home after picking up his son from school and his wife from her teaching job when gunmen drove alongside and sprayed his car using automatic weapons. All three were killed. Routinely, students threaten their teachers and it is now common for bullets to be sent to staff through the internal post. Since the occupation, the Brussels Tribunal, an anti-war campaign group, says at least 193 academics have been killed. But is Thyab's idea of secularisation the answer? Dr Omer Sherko, an Iraqi researcher at Nottingham University, says not. \"This is the same old thinking and attitude of stopping student activities - religious or political - as in Saddam's era,\" he says. \"Selecting someone on his religious background is not a proper way to choose a university president.\" Professor Nazar Amin, of Sulaimani University in Kurdistan, northern Iraq, says: \"I believe that working towards that approach [secularisation] is a good thing, but not easy under the present circumstances. It is almost impossible now to appoint a Christian as a university president.A dean of a college is possible, but not a president. \" Dr Jairam Reddy, who wrote a report on the state of Iraq's universities in 2005 for the United Nations University, believes the country needs a national commission for higher education to restore academic institutions and rebuild its academic heritage. \"Instead of bringing about piecemeal changes, a comprehensive plan is needed, based on an investigation by a small committee appointed to advise the minister.\" Thyab is adamant. \"Sectarian violence will flourish and tensions will continue [if the universities are not secularised].\" He says most university laboratories have been looted and that there is considerable danger of sectarian violence on campus. This is particularly the case in Baghdad, where religious, ethnic and nationalist groups are making claims to national and local political power. \"The security in Baghdad is still not safe, but it is improving,\" he says. CCTV cameras now capture would-be bombers and barriers try to protect institutions from car bombs. Students and professors can now swap to a university in a different region for six months if they have security worries. More than 1,000 academics and 10,000 students have done so. \"Of course, I can't say that these steps have stopped the violence 100%,\" he says. \"They are helping. People have the courage to go to university. There is a strong determination among the students that they will graduate. It is disruptive, of course. But even if a shop is blown up, that is not going to stop the education system. We are going to stick to our standards and achieve our goals.\" Apathy and corruption Critics say obstacles other than sectarian violence stand in the way of those goals - apathy and corruption created by the Ba'athist regime, to start with. But there is reason to be optimistic, Thyab says. This year, all school-leavers who wanted to go to university did so. His visit to the UK marks the launch of a scholarship scheme that will enable 200 Iraqi students a year to study in the UK, over the next 10 years. He is also here to sign a memorandum that signals Iraq and Britain's intention to improve the Iraqi education system, and to strengthen ties between the two countries. \"We want to have international accreditation of our academic programmes, to show the international population that although the situation is bad, it is getting better,\" he says. \"We want to have quality assurance, curriculum development and to improve the student experience.\" The ministry has spent $50m (\u00a325.7m) equipping university laboratories, and there is more to come. All universities now have internet access and the universities of Baghdad, Mustansiriya, Technology and Al-Nahrain have video conferencing facilities. And, as of six months ago, students and academics can log on to an e-library of 17,000 online books. \"Within four years,\" he says, \"Iraqi universities will be as good as the average western university.\" Curriculum vitae Born: 1957, Salahaddin province, north of Baghdad Job: Iraq's minister of higher education and scientific research Before that: Worked as a computer scientist in Middle Eastern universities"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
