A team who have been rudderless of late in the top-flight edged into only the fourth FA Cup semi-final in club history at Reading\u2019s expense here, all that frustration at the concession of a late penalty which was so costly at home to Liverpool last Sunday eased by the manic celebrations of one of their own. This side\u2019s fortunes have fluctuated wildly within a matter of days. A tight contest had been drifting towards a replay, the visitors\u2019 pressure frustrated by Ali al-Habsi\u2019s brilliance in the home goal, when their hosts finally cracked to reward Palace\u2019s relentless pursuit of progress. Jake Cooper was the fall guy, pulling Yannick Bolasie with his right hand as a ball was looped back optimistically through the middle, which Habsi might otherwise have hoped to claim. There was some contact as the centre-half stepped across the winger, just as there had been when Damien Delaney\u2019s left knee touched Christian Benteke\u2019s heel last weekend. Cooper duly trudged off at the flash of a second yellow card. The award was put to Alan Pardew, a player at this club on their only appearance in an FA Cup final back in 1990, in the aftermath. \u201cI don\u2019t really think you should ask me because, obviously, I ain\u2019t got a clue about penalties after last weekend,\u201d he offered. \u201cBut I\u2019d said to my players that, having defended Damo and [criticised] that decision so publicly, if they did go down they had to be very sure they\u2019d been impeded.\u201d His opposite number, Brian McDermott, did not sound entirely convinced by Bolasie\u2019s eager tumble, but acknowledged his own player had \u201craised his arm\u201d. It said much about Habsi\u2019s inspired display that he still mustered a hand to Yohan Cabaye\u2019s spot-kick, thumped down the middle, but could not keep it out. That the visitors put gloss on the victory with a second in stoppage time, the substitute Fraizer Campbell converting from virtually on the goal-line after Habsi had pushed his initial attempt on to a post, at least reflected their overall dominance even if the Omani deserved better. The 34-year-old, an unused substitute when Wigan hoisted this trophy in 2013, was magnificent in holding Palace at bay until four minutes from time. If he had done well to thwart Cabaye\u2019s first-half free-kick and suffocate attempts from Emmanuel Adebayor and Bolasie, the reaction save to deny Mile Jedinak the opener 10 minutes into the second period defied belief. The goalkeeper had somehow thrust out a left hand to paw away the Australian\u2019s emphatic header, and would repeat his trick on another Cabaye set-play while the tie remained goalless. Elimination felt cruel on a player described by his manager simply as \u201can outstanding human being\u201d. Pardew, pacing his technical area in frustration as his team huffed and puffed but could find no way through \u2013 the story of much of their campaign \u2013 might not have been quite so complimentary, so sick of the sight of the hosts\u2019 No26 he must have been while the resistance held. Even so, there was a vibrancy to Palace\u2019s attacking here, albeit against a team ensconced in mid-table in the Championship, having slipped from joint fourth on Christmas Day to a potentially precarious position eight points shy of the cut-off. Wilfried Zaha, who riled the locals after clashing with Chris Gunter early in the second half, was outstanding, scything beyond an exposed Jordan Obita at will and galloping upfield in partnership with Bolasie. Adebayor needs a goal to restore confidence but there were glimpses again of his quality, while Cabaye looked more at ease than of late. In victory, the FA Cup can feel like a positive distraction once again. Not that Palace had this all their own way. In Ola John, a Dutch winger who has swapped Benfica for Berkshire on a season-long arrangement, Reading posed a threat of their own who might have plundered where the visitors were so profligate. He had already seen a shot deflected just wide when Wayne Hennessey horribly misjudged Hal Robson-Kanu\u2019s in-swinging centre and, instead of allowing it to drift behind, merely knocked the ball down obligingly for John to collect. The goal gaped but, with Palace\u2019s defenders helpless and aghast, the angle proved too tight for the forward to convert. His other opportunity had been squeezed out 14 minutes from time, amid Palace\u2019s 15 corners and the hacked goal-line clearances summoned by Gunter and Stephen Quinn. Robson-Kanu\u2019s centre bypassed the clutter in the six-yard box to reach John, unmarked at the far post, only for Hennessey to claw away a header that might have been better directed across goal. It was a smart stop, and one desperately needed by a goalkeeper whose own recent confidence has been rather battered. His reward was to see Palace\u2019s pursuit finally yield reward in what time remained. \u201cI\u2019m pleased for our fans who have suffered in our home games of late,\u201d added Pardew, who had spent four years at Reading when cutting his teeth as a manager before an acrimonious switch to West Ham. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see that end behind the goal happy with a semi-final to come. That brings an excitement we hope rubs off on our league form.\u201d They could be 16th and six points from the relegation zone by the time they next play but, for one night only, those concerns could wait. Palace can rejoice at the thought of Wembley."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
