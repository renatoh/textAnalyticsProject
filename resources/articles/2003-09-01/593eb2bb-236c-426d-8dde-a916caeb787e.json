Yet in the process he may have to restore some older components. O'Leary's determination \"to create a new Villa\" is becoming the Irishman's mantra here. Now that he has exhausted his buying funds, he must make do and mend, which means refurbishing some bruised - some would say difficult - egos. Juan Pablo Angel certainly did not come to the Midlands from River Plate to start only eight Premiership games last season, his bitter experience under Graham Taylor. Two goals in six minutes from the ebullient Colombian striker, doubling his league tally of last campaign, portrays a much happier South American story. Villa's record \u00a39.5m fee for Angel has, for various reasons, often puzzled and perplexed. Now a greater weight will fall on him while Darius Vassell's ongoing pelvic problem forces a rest, probably after minor surgery. Vassell will miss England's double-header against Macedonia and Liechtenstein, O'Leary lamenting: \"It should have been sorted out before.\" Angel is ready. \"It was a perfect day for me,\" he said. \"We're doing things the right way and we've got a good manager. I'm enjoying the football.\" His feelings about the former manager are clear: \"If Graham Taylor had stayed, I would have definitely moved. Definitely.\" O'Leary appears to have rehabilitated Olof Mellberg, ever present and captain under Taylor, after dropping the Swedish centre-back and relieving him of the leadership on the opening day. Alpay, after his rebellion last season, has also entered into the new spirit, according to the manager. But the Turkish international may not have rebuilt his bridges with the fans to judge by the Holte End's boos when he came on. Villa took their season's first win and much encouragement from beating Leicester for only the second time in 15 years; Micky Adams took \"nothing\". Despite Muzzy Izzet's curling free-kick in the second half, when his side had only 10 men, Adams insisted \"it's back to the drawing board\". The fight was unequal even before Les Ferdinand earned a sending-off and almost certainly a fine for rank unprofessionalism, thinly disguised as dissent shown to the referee Steve Bennett after an obvious foul on Mellberg. \"You can't defend it,\" said Adams, though he will be inquiring into it. \"It seems it wasn't for foul or abusive language,\" he added later. \"Any punishment will be behind closed doors.\" Ferdinand had scarcely been seen until the 39th-minute incident, and much the same could be said of Leicester's defence. Ben Thatcher headed into his own net and Angel added a header and a volley. Both were set up by the highly promising teenage midfielder Peter Whittingham. Leicester lost two defenders, John Curtis and Steve Howey, with injury by the 31st minute. Now, trouble comes in threes - Leicester will miss a trio of suspended players against Leeds a week on Monday.
