The Treasury select committee wants the Financial Conduct Authority to \u201cset out the detail of its supervisory contact\u201d with the Woodford Equity Income Fund. It also wants to know whether the watchdog plans to launch a formal investigation of the events that led to investors being blocked from cashing out their investments and to explain \u201chow long such a suspension should be\u201d. The MP and committee chair, Nicky Morgan, said in a letter to the FCA chief Andrew Bailey that the suspension of the fund \u201chas raised significant concerns about its impact on investors and the wider regulation and supervision of funds\u201d. Morgan said in a statement: \u201cQuestions have been raised about the FCA\u2019s alertness to the problem.\u201d Last week, Woodford, one of the UK\u2019s best-known stock-pickers, gated his flagship fund after being overwhelmed with demands from investors wanting to withdraw their cash in the wake of a series of poor market bets. Morgan\u2019s letter asked Bailey for a breakdown of how investment funds are regulated and whether those rules may now be changed. It also asked the FCA chief when the regulator would intervene. Woodford\u2019s flagship fund was suspended for 28 days, with a review scheduled for the end of that period. Morgan has also requested a timeline detailing the FCA\u2019s contacts with Woodford\u2019s fund as well as with authorities in Guernsey, where Woodford listed some of his private company investments. Those listings allowed Woodford to comply with EU rules that limit the proportion of unlisted investments to 10%. An FCA spokesman confirmed that the regulator had received the letter and plans to respond. Bailey and the FCA chair, Charles Randell, will appear in front of the Treasury select committee on 25 June. The committee\u2019s letter was released on Monday as Woodford refused customers\u2019 requests to see a complete list of fund investments. Woodford has always allowed investors to see a full list of shareholdings in the funds he manages, but will disclose only the top 10 holdings in all three funds during the suspension. The firm said the move was in the best interest of investors as the firm sells down shares to realise the cash it needs to repay investors. Woodford\u2019s stock market-listed fund also attempted to reassure investors over its performance, despite its shares falling to record lows. The share price of Woodford\u2019s Patient Capital Trust Fund, which is listed on London\u2019s FTSE 250 index, tumbled to 59p on Monday, down from 76p before Woodford gated the Equity Income Fund. In a statement designed to calm investors\u2019 nerves, Patient Capital Trust said: \u201cThe board is pleased with the operational progress of its portfolio companies, which the board believes continue to have the potential to deliver attractive returns, in line with the long-term mandate of the company. The operational performance of these businesses is not impacted by recent events.\u201d Susan Searle, the chair of Patient Capital Trust, said: \u201cThe board is closely monitoring the situation and is engaging with its shareholders and advisers. Separately, the board is in regular dialogue with the portfolio manager. The board wishes to emphasise the long-term approach of the company and will continue to keep shareholders updated as necessary.\u201d Shares in Hargreaves Lansdown, which recommended and sold Woodford\u2019s funds, were down by nearly 3% on Monday, despite news that the stockbroker is considering removing the Woodford fund from certain portfolios. Emma Wall, head of investment analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cWe constantly review our funds, but obviously special attention will be triggered by events such as a period of underperformance, change in manager or a liquidity issue such as gating. \u201cIt would be insincere to say that this is business as usual, and we will be taking this time to consider our position. Any decision made will be communicated first with the investors in the funds affected.\u201d The Hargreaves Lansdown\u2019s chief executive, Chris Hill, issued an apology to investors over the weekend after thousands of the FTSE 100 company\u2019s clients found their money trapped following the fund\u2019s suspension."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
