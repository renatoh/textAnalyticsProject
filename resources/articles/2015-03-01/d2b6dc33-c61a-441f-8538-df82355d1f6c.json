Clarkson has been left in limbo for two weeks since the BBC announced his suspension following what it described as \u201ca fracas\u201d with producer Oisin Tymon. Clarkson and Tymon have given evidence to an internal BBC investigation, led by Ken MacQuarrie, into what happened and the star\u2019s future is expected to be decided this week. Radio 1 controller Ben Cooper said: \u201cI think if my son or daughter went to a place of work where they were shouted at, abused and someone threw a punch at them, I would want there to be an inquiry and for that to be dealt with in a very serious way and that\u2019s what the BBC is currently doing.\u201d Speaking to reporters on Monday, he said he thought a decision was \u201cabout 24 hours away\u201d. Clarkson, alongside co-hosts James May and Richard Hammond, was scheduled to take part in four live Top Gear shows in Norway this week, but it was announced on Sunday they had been postponed. On the same day, Clarkson described his week as \u201cturbulent\u201d and claimed he was joking when he appeared to criticise BBC bosses during an expletive-laden rant at a charity event. The presenter had appeared to suggest he may be sacked from the BBC2 show and criticised the corporation\u2019s executives. Clarkson said that he was told off by his lawyer after his on-stage speech at a charity gala in north London was captured on video. But he said in the Sunday Times that it had all been in good humour, writing: \u201cIt was all meant in jest and anyway it worked. \u201cBy being brief, controversial and a bit sweary I woke the room up and the auction prize I was offering \u2013 one last lap of the Top Gear test track \u2013 raised 100,000.\u201d Clarkson had told those gathered at the charity event: \u201cTo be in the audience of Top Gear there was an 18-year waiting list. You know the BBC has fucked themselves, and so who gives a fuck? \u201cIt was a great show and they fucked it up.\u201d He is reported to be considering new shows, including a programme about a novice trying to run a farm. Clarkson tweeted his thanks to supporters of a petition, delivered by tank to BBC headquarters in London on Friday, but declared in his column in the Sun that \u201cprotest never works\u201d. Meanwhile, with money-spinning show Top Gear off air during the internal investigation, May has been tweeting about getting to grips with life without work to distract him. He wrote at the weekend: \u201cWoodwork tasks today. Being jobless allows you to revisit old interests, learn new things, and listen to the radio more. Sold the telly.\u201d May had previously told his fans: \u201cI\u2019ve been given some heavy gardening work today. Temptation to cut my own head off with the chainsaw may prove too strong. StillUnemployed.\u201d The corporation\u2019s internal investigation into Clarkson\u2019s conduct is being handed over to the director-general, and could be resolved as early as tomorrow. The BBC has not commented on when the investigation will be completed but it is understood that they want it finished as soon as possible."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
