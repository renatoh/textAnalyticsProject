Morgan played a full part in training with Craig Shakespeare\u2019s squad on Friday and having sat out his side\u2019s 2-2 Premier League draw at Crystal Palace, participated again on Sunday in an effort to prove his readiness. The centre-half is being closely monitored by Leicester\u2019s medical staff, who will continue to assess his condition. His involvement is made all the more vital by Robert Huth\u2019s suspension. That has left Shakespeare reliant upon Yohan Benalouane \u2013 who pulled up with cramp at Selhurst Park and was withdrawn 14 minutes from time as a precaution \u2013 and Morgan, given that Marcin Wasilewski has not been included in their Champions League squad and Molla Wagu\u00e9, who has only played once since joining in January, is recovering from a dislocated shoulder. The manager moved Christian Fuchs to centre-half for the final few minutes against Palace, with Ben Chilwell introduced at left-back, but the Austrian was unconvincing in the central role. \u201cIt\u2019s an option,\u201d said Shakespeare, who will also have to assess Islam Slimani after the forward hurt a groin in training at the end of last week. \u201cWe will have to look at the injury situation. I\u2019m assured Benalouane was just cramp. Cramp can turn into a pull, so it was just a precaution, but he\u2019s walking fine. \u201cIt looked better [for Morgan] on Friday. He trained with the group for the whole session. It\u2019s a big ask for him to be fit because it\u2019s a difficult injury to get over, in terms of the power and spring for a centre-back. But we\u2019ll give him every opportunity and with the medical staff, we\u2019ll see what their feelings are and we\u2019ll make a decision.\u201d Shakespeare had opted to make only two changes from the first leg at the Vicente Calder\u00f3n stadium for the game at Palace \u2013 where his team led 2-0 but were pegged back \u2013 and the majority of his squad undertook a recovery session at the club\u2019s Belvoir Drive training complex on Sunday. \u201cWe know what\u2019s needed of us so we\u2019ll manage ourselves with help from the staff and, hopefully, we\u2019ll be in the best shape we can coming into the game,\u201d said Danny Drinkwater. \u201cThe physios who look after the injuries do a great job here with managing players so that\u2019s good. I\u2019m sure Wes is getting better.\u201d The England midfielder insisted Leicester\u2019s players had been buoyed by their showing in the first leg in Spain, despite the 1-0 defeat to a controversial penalty converted by Antoine Griezmann. \u201cWe\u2019re a confident team,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the result from Madrid has given us a bit of confidence and it\u2019s only 1-0, we\u2019ve still got a chance in this game. I can\u2019t wait for the second game. No one can. It\u2019s a big chance for us on a massive stage and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to be one of those games you wish you could play in when your career is over. \u201cTo be 1-0 [down] away is still a strong position for us. The same as 2-1 was away from home in Seville \u2013 we\u2019re looking forward to it and we\u2019ll be ready. We know what they\u2019re capable of, and it can be daunting for the away teams coming to Leicester, definitely. You\u2019d hope the nation got behind us as the only English team left in the Champions League, and we\u2019ll use what we\u2019ve got at our home ground to our advantage. They\u2019re a good team, but we\u2019ll work on what we have to work on to get the game won and, hopefully, get into the semi-final.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
