His left eye was almost closed and the skin around both eyes was black, blue, pink, purple and swollen. He had just fought 12 hard rounds against World Boxing Association welterweight champion Luis Collazo. Hatton outpunched his opponent 259 to 213, but Collazo was the one who had finished the stronger, staggering Ricky with a series of blows midway through the final round. The decision of the judges was still unanimous: 115-112, 115-112, 114-113 for Hatton. Hatton took a deep breath and exhaled slowly. An icepack was pressed against his left eye. 'Are you all right?' his mother asked. 'Of course I'm all right.' Ricky smiled, then countered a with question of his own. 'I don't make things easy, do I? Did the fans get value for money?' They certainly had, he was told. 'This was my toughest fight,' Hatton said. 'I rose to the occasion against Kostya Tszyu and Collazo did the same tonight. He's a good fighter. He's tricky and has a style that's hard for me. He took the body shots well. The last round he shook me, but I had my faculties about me the whole time. I told myself, \"Stay close; grab a hold\". It was just a matter of riding out the storm. People remember fights like this. I don't want too many of them, but it's important to win a few like tonight.' Hatton stood up to take a shower before adding a final thought. 'Show me a fighter who has an easy night every time, and I'll show my ass in Woolworth's window.' Hatton won the little regarded World Boxing Union light-welterweight title in 2001 and successfully defended it 16 times. But in the United States, he was thought of as a paper champion until 4 June last year, when he beat Kostya Tszyu for the IBF crown. Then, in November, he knocked out WBA belt holder Carlos Maussa to unify the 140-pound titles. But there was still a problem. 'I had fought for so long in England that a lot of people thought I was a protected fighter,' Hatton acknowledged. 'I want to be recognised as a great fighter; and not just in England. I had to come to the States to prove myself.' To do so he stepped up a weight. Hatton signed a multi-fight deal with HBO, the cable network that dominates boxing in America. The contract calls for three fights (two this year and one during the first five months of 2007). The licence fees for US television rights are substantial, with numbers that can be adjusted upward depending on the quality of the opponent from a floor of more than \u00a31.5m per fight. 'I'm coming to America for the money and the respect,' Hatton said after the contract was finalised. 'It has been a dream of mine ever since I laced on a pair of gloves to be a headliner in the United States. It's something my heroes and idols have all done. I want people all over the world to know my name.' HBO believes that Hatton's crossover appeal will cross over the Atlantic. 'I'm no different from the man in the crowd,' Hatton has said. 'There are no bodyguards. I don't want VIP treatment. When I fight in Manchester, most of the people in the arena have shaken hands with me. The best thing about being a fighter is when people come up to me and say, \"Ricky, you're a world champion and you're just like me\". What the fans think means a lot to me. There's no point in being a great fighter if people think you're a dickhead.' The more people in America get to know Hatton, the more they will like him. However, the jury is still out in America as to how good a fighter he is. Clearly, Ricky is world-class with a crowd-pleasing non-stop style. But is he great? Hatton's initial preference had been to fight in October against the winner of the WBC lightweight title match-up between Jose Luis Castillo and Diego Corrales at 140 pounds, which was scheduled for 3 June. But that situation devolved into chaos when Castillo failed to make the weight and the bout was cancelled. So what comes next? Other fighters on the preferred list include Miguel Cotto and the winner of the 147-pound WBC title fight between Carlos Baldomir and Arturo Gatti, which takes place on the 22nd of this month. Down the road, of course, there's reigning 'pound-for-pound' king Floyd Mayweather Jr. A victory over Mayweather would do more than guarantee acceptance by the American public. It would ensure Hatton a place among boxing's ring immortals. 'My dream,' says Hatton, 'would be to fight Mayweather in 2007 in an outdoor event at Manchester City's stadium. I don't think there's anybody who can outbox Floyd Mayweather. If we fight, I'll have to just jump all over him. But from now on, whoever I fight, I want defining fights and major champions every time.' \u00b7 Thomas Hauser is the author of 33 books and the primary columnist for Secondsout.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
