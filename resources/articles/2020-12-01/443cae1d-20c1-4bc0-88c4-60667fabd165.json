Chelsea go top of the league with a terrific victory at Stamford Bridge. They ignored the shock of Patrick Bamford\u2019s early goal and created a stream of chances throughout. Olivier Giroud equalised, Kurt Zouma headed them in front in the second half and the substitute Christian Pulisic completed the win in injury time. Leeds were good in the first half but tired in the second, though they probably should have had a penalty at 2-1. Chelsea were much the better team, though, and could have won by more. That was a fine goal. Kovacic slid the ball inside Dallas to release the pacy Werner on the right. He charged into the area and slid a low cross towards Pulisic, who guided the ball past Meslier on the run. Chelsea wrap it up on the break! 90 min Four minutes of added time. 88 min The injured Thiago Silva wins a brilliant defensive header, getting above Bamford to clear Ayling\u2019s cross. He can\u2019t run but he can still jump. 88 min Thiago Silva is unable to run properly, though he is going to stay out there. I\u2019m surprised Chelsea haven\u2019t moved another player back into the centre of their defence. 87 min Dallas slips and gives the ball to Werner, who runs straight at the heart of the defence and slides in Abraham. He cracks a first-time cross-shot that whistles a few yards wide of the far post. 85 min Thiago Silva is receiving treatment. Chelsea have used all three subs, so he\u2019s going to stay on. He\u2019s holding his right hamstring, mind. 84 min Leeds almost steal an equaliser. Klich angles a sharp pass into Rodrigo on the left side of the area. He cuts the ball back towards Bamford, who makes a mess of a first-time shot and pokes it well wide. 83 min Leeds lookpretty tired. At this stage, a third Chelsea goal looks much likelier than an equaliser. 80 min Just before that shot in the 78th minute, Poveda-Ocampo was fouled in the area by Chilwell. He stayed on his feet; had he gone down, VAR would have given a penalty. It was almost identical to the Robertson/Welbeck incident at Brighton a week ago. The difference is that Poveda-Ocampo stayed on his feet and was punished. What a mess. 79 min Olivier Giroud, who has had a mixed night, is replaced by Tammy Abraham. He scored one; he could have had another hat-trick. 78 min Poveda-Ocampo\u2019s 20-yard shot is comfortably saved by Mendy. 77 min Mount\u2019s corner is headed over from seven yards by the unmarked Giroud. That was yet another good chance for Chelsea. 76 min: Fine save by Meslier! Chelsea should be 3-1 ahead. Mount, on the left wing, curls a splendid pass around the defence to find Werner at the far post, eight yards out. He takes the shot first time but Meslier spreads himself and deflects it behind. 74 min Diego Llorente is booked for a foul on Kovacic. 73 min Bamford has injured himself while winning the ball off Kante. I think it\u2019s cramp. If not Leeds will be down to 10 men because they\u2019ve used all three subs. 72 min Rodrigo plays a clever short pass through the legs of Zouma that almost reaches Bamford in the area. Almost but not quite. 72 min For reasons that aren\u2019t entirely clear, the Chelsea fans are emitting high-pitched wails every time Diego Llorente touches the ball. 71 min An awkward long-range shot from Mount is well held by Meslier. 69 min Leeds make their last change: Rodrigo replaces Alioski. 68 min: Just wide from Giroud! Mount and Pulisic combined to find Chilwell on the left. His low cross ricocheted off at least two players, probably more, before being steered past the near post by Giroud. 66 min Chelsea make their second change: Mateo Kovacic replaces the subdued Kai Havertz. 65 min Chelsea have been very good in the second half and deserve to be ahead. 63 min On reflection, I think Cooper might have been fouled by Giroud just before the Zouma goal. Giroud knew nothing about it as he was looking at the ball, but he seemed to run into Cooper and knock him off balance. I\u2019d like to see it again. Either way, I don\u2019t think it counts as a clear and obvious error. Chelsea take the lead from the corner! It was simple stuff: Mount\u2019s outswinger, Zouma\u2019s accomplished downward header. Leeds appealed for a foul against Cooper, but there was nothing in it. The goal stands! 60 min: Brilliant goalkeeping from Meslier! Werner, put through by Giroud, is denied twice in the space of two seconds by Meslier. The first save was particularly good because he had to change direction and plunge to his left when the ball deflected off Alioski. After the second save the ball rebounded to Mount, whose close-range shot deflected wide off Cooper. That was a great block. 58 min Ian Poveda-Ocampo replaces Jack Harrison for Leeds. 57 min The indefatigable Klich - what a film that was by the way - wins a corner for Leeds. Phillips drives it flat to the edge of the area, where Raphinha arrives late to thump a volley towards goal. Thiago Silva blocks it in the six-yard box but the ball rebounds to Raphinha, who lifts it over the bar! That was a chance, and a fine set-piece from Leeds. 56 min Chelsea have been much the better team since half-time. Thiago Silva strolls forward and lifts a pass over the defence towards Pulisic. Dallas heads it back towards Meslier, who was on his way out towards Pulisic but has enough time to get back and grab the ball. 54 min James clips it cleverly towards the near post, where Havertz heads over from three yards. It was a trickier chance than it first appeared because of the height and pace on the ball. 53 min The corner is half cleared to the left wing, where Chilwell is booted up in the air by Alioski. Chelsea have a free-kick in a really good position on the left. 53 min That\u2019s much better from Havertz, an elegant, direct run into the area that leads to a corner on the right for Chelsea. 51 min A lovely first-time pass out of defence from Thiago Silva sets Chelsea on the attack. Eventually Pulisic cuts inside and hits a shot that has the sting taken out of it by Llorente. 49 min Meslier stands on the ball in his own six-yard box, which almost leads to a comedy own-goal/tap-in for Giroud. In the end he has enough time, just about, to boot the ball away. 46 min Havertz is given a warning after a late tackle on Alioski. He looks a bit lost at the moment. 46 min Peep peep! Leeds begin the second half. A note on that Timo Werner miss earlier on - replays show that Illan Meslier flipped his shot onto the bar. That would explain how Werner managed to locate the underside of the crossbar from 0.001 yards. Half-time reading Peep peep! Chelsea should be ahead but Leeds contributed plenty to a richly enjoyable 45 minutes. Patrick Bamford gave Leeds an early, scoring against his old club after a delicious pass from Kalvin Phillips. Olivier Giroud was denied by a bizarre goalline clearance from his team-mate Timo Werner (with friends like you, who needs friends) but equalised later in the half from Reece James\u2019 excellent cross. 45+2 min The substitute Llorente makes a vital sliding tackle on Chilwell, who looked set to move through on goal in the inside-left channel. 45+1 min It\u2019s not just Kalvin Phillips\u2019 range that is so impressive; his pass selection is extremely good. 45 min Three added minutes. 43 min \u201cEarlier in the season, I emailed you to explain how Bamford was one of those players who is too good for the Championship, but ultimately not quite good enough for the Premier League,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cI respectfully request the opportunity to rescind that opinion. He has looked good. He hasn\u2019t just scored a lot of goals so far; he\u2019s scored some very, very good goals. There\u2019s definitely a player in there.\u201d I\u2019m intrigued by players improve who when they go up a level, either to a higher division or a club with better players. Dwight Yorke is the obvious example. 42 min Werner, playing on the right now, charges at Alioski in the area and hammers a cross-shot that is kicked behind by Cooper at the near post. The corner is headed down by Chilwell and claimed bravely by Meslier in front of a flying Chelsea boot. 40 min Havertz, who is having a poor game, runs into trouble near the halfway line and is dispossessed by Harrison. He angles a through pass towards Bamford, who is lining up a shot when Zouma appears to make an important tackle. Moments later, Mendy comes a fair way out of his goal to claim a cross at the second attempt. 39 min ... And Bamford will head it away. 38 min Pulisic swings his hips this way and that to win a corner for Chelsea. Mount will take it... 35 min Klich\u2019s corner is headed away by Zouma. 34 min Ayling wins a corner for Leeds, who are giving as good as they get. It\u2019s been such an entertaining game so far. 32 min \u201cThis style of end-to-end play is perfectly suited to Pulisic\u2019s skill set,\u201d says Mary Waltz. 31 min Llorente plays a poor pass, straight to the other substitute Pulisic on the edge of the area. He is not quite up to speed, however, and he dithers long enough for Cooper to clear the danger. 30 min A disappointed Ziyech trudges off; a bearded Pulisic sprints on in his place. 29 min The restart has been delayed while Hakim Ziyech receives treatment. It looks like a hamstring injury, and Christian Pulisic is getting ready to replace him. It was a typically smart finish from Giroud. Ziyech played in the overlapping James, whose excellent near-post cross was volleyed past Meslier on the stretch by Giroud. Leeds appealed for offside but Ayling was deeper than everyone else and played him on. Olivier Giroud equalises for Chelsea! 26 min The impressive Raphinha beats two players on a mosey infield and finds Bamford in the D. He sidefoots a low shot that is comfortably saved by Mendy, falling to his right. It was a pretty tame effort from Bamford; I think he was hoping Mendy would be unsighted. 24 min Klich\u2019s corner is headed away by Havertz, a reminder that he is on the pitch. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be fine at Chelsea, for he is class, but he hasn\u2019t settled yet. 23 min I can\u2019t stop thinking about Kalvin Phillips\u2019 pass - with his left foot by the way - for the goal. He looks a helluva player. 21 min The Chelsea supporters start effin and jeffin when Alioski takes his time over a throw-in. They almost have something to cheer when Meslier plays a wretched pass towasrds Ayling that is stolen by Giroud on the edge of the D. He pushes the ball into the area but drives a low shot just wide. That was another pretty good chance. 20 min \u201cThe best of Sir Alex\u2019s Manchester United teams would get four, even five, men in the box in open play,\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cLeeds, 1-0 up away, just had six.\u201d Remember when Leeds were always either Dirty or Nasty? Now they\u2019re the most joyful team in England. 19 min Alioski hits the post with a rasping drive, though it wouldn\u2019t have counted because Ayling was about four miles offside in the build up. 18 min A quiet spell in the game, believe it or not. It\u2019s been a spectacular start. 14 min This isn\u2019t news, but Kalvin Phillips is a class act. He starts another Leeds move with a good pass out to Harrison on the left. Harrison plays in the underlapping Klich, whose cutback is slapped wide of the near post by Bamford. He couldn\u2019t wrap his foot around it enough to get it on target. 13 min This is brilliant stuff. Raphinha teases Chilwell on the right of the area and slides a low pass towards Harrison, whose first-time shot is blocked by Zouma. That was a chance. 12 min Despite being a goal down, Chelsea have started this game brilliantly. The tempo of their play has been excellent and they\u2019ve already had three notable chances. 10 min Replays suggest Giroud\u2019s header might not have been going in, so maybe Werner deserves the benefit of the doubt. He should still have scored himself, though. He was barely a yard out when he belted the ball almost vertically onto the bar. 9 min: Werner clears off the line - for Leeds! This is blooper DVD gold. Mount\u2019s corner was headed on by Giroud and seemed to be going in at the far post. Then Werner appeared from nowhere to flick the ball up and volley it onto the crossbar! 8 min Werner\u2019s shot deflects behind for a corner. Before it is taken, Leeds are forced to make a substitution: Robin Koch, who was doubtful for the game, is replaced by the Spanish international Diego Llorente. This is his Leeds debut. 5 min There was no extravagant celebration from Bamford, just the increasingly familiar lightning bolt. But he must be on an almighty high right now. What a fine goal from Leeds! Phillips, on the halfway line by the left touchline, curled a stunning left-footed pass around Zouma to put Bamford through on goal. Mendy came out to the edge of the area but Bamford slipped past him and sidefooted the ball into the empty net. The finish was immaculate, the pass quite glorious. Patrick Bamford scores against his old club! 2 min: Giroud misses an excellent chance! Mount\u2019s corner from the left is headed just wide of the near post by Giroud. He arrived late and towered over the Leeds defenders, but his downward header hit the side netting. 1 min: Ziyech almost scores after 44 seconds! Thiago Silva drove a nice pass over the defence to Ziyech, who made a nice angled run from the right. He took the ball down beautifully on the run and drove a low shot that was kicked away by Meslier. 1 min Peep peep! Chelsea, in blue, kick off from right to left. Leeds are in their maroon change strip. Chelsea emerge from the tunnel to a raucous ovation from the 2,000 fans at Stamford Bridge. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve got until it\u2019s gone for nine months. West Ham 1-3 Man Utd was the final score at the London Stadium. West Ham should have been out of sight at half-time; they weren\u2019t, and Manchester United were sensational in the last 25 minutes. The chosen two thousand \u201cWondering how the lucky fans who get to attend are chosen,\u201d says Ezra Finkelstein. \u201cs it like a lottery or based on loyalty?\u201d It\u2019s done by ballot. Pre-match reading Chelsea and Leeds were responsible for one of the filthiest - and funniest - matches in football history. This is definitely worth ten minutes of your time. Olivier Giroud, who scored F-O-U-R goals in Seville in the week, makes his first Premier League start of the season. Leeds are unchanged from the team that won so well at Everton last Saturday. Chelsea (4-3-3) Mendy; James, Zouma, Thiago, Chilwell; Havertz, Kante, Mount; Ziyech, Giroud, Werner. Substitutes: Kepa, Rudiger, Azpilicueta, Jorginho, Pulisic, Abraham, Kovacic. Leeds (4-1-4-1) Meslier; Ayling, Koch, Cooper, Alioski; Phillips; Raphinha, Klich, Dallas, Harrison; Bamford. Substitutes: Casilla, Llorente, Struijk, Poveda-Ocampo, Roberts, Helder Costa, Rodrigo. Referee Kevin Friend. I spy with my little eye, a very tasty Saturday-night fixture. This is the first Premier League meeting between Chelsea and Leeds since 2004, yet it comes with a decent backstory. The fun and games between Frank Lampard and Marcelo Bielsa two seasons ago, when Lampard was at Derby, will give tonight\u2019s game an extra edge. The return of supporters to Stamford Bridge for the first time since March won\u2019t hurt either. A win would put Chelsea top overnight, but Leeds\u2019 intrepid freewheelers will test their new, dramatically improved defence. At the other end, Bielsa\u2019s man-markers will do well to cope with the speed and individual skill of Chelsea\u2019s forward. Chelsea have been involved in a couple of bore draws this season; this, surely, will not be dull. Kick off 8pm."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
