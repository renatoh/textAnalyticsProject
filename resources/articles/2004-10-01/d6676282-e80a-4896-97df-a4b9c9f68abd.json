Yesterday the entrepreneur, who amassed stakes in three companies over the summer, declared the sale of his 8.3% interest in Aim-listed Financial Development Corporation. City traders believe Mr Ramsden has also offloaded his 15% holding in Trading Sports Exchange Systems. A statement is expected today. If true, it means Mr Ramsden's only stock market investment is a 26% holding in Caplay - a cash shell he plans to use to develop the Private Treaty Market, a securities settlement system. Shareholders in FDC are unlikely to mourn the passing of Mr Ramsden. According to rumours in the Square Mile a reverse takeover deal has already been lined-up by a leading City banker. It is thought to involve an oil company that has the rights to drill an exciting prospect. FDC shares closed 0.25p higher at 3.25p, while Trading Sports finished unchanged at 15p and Caplay held firm at 5.25p."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
