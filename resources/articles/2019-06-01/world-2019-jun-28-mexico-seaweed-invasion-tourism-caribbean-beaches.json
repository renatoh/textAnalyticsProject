But almost as fast as they could be cleared away, more clumps of algae were washing ashore, forming foul-smelling mounds across the white sands of the beach. \u201cYou clear an area and four hours later or by the next day, it looks the same,\u201d said Jorge Sandoval, one of the workers. Mexico has spent $17m in an attempt to clear 500,000 tons of sargassum seaweed from its Caribbean beaches, but the problem only seems to be getting worse. And now tourists are starting to notice: hotel occupancy rates have dropped and tourism chiefs are concerned that the seaweed is threatening a key industry in the Mayan Riviera, which stretches from Canc\u00fan to the Belize border. Scientists say the seaweed normally plays an important role in the regional ecosystem: rafts of floating sargassum provide important habitat for birds and marine species in the Atlantic, while smaller amounts of sargassum are normal on beaches and considered beneficial. But for the past decade, sargassum has been blooming excessively across the Caribbean. The reasons remain unclear, but scientists say human activities are aggravating factors, while rising ocean temperatures are also thought to play a role. The proliferation of sargassum has been fueled by agricultural fertilisers and untreated sewage flowing into the Caribbean and Atlantic. Barely 30% of wastewater in Mexico\u2019s Mayan Riviera is treated, said Mar\u00eda del Carmen Garc\u00eda Rivas, a biologist in Puerto Morelos with Mexico\u2019s National Protected Areas Commission. In turn, rotting sargassum increases the sea\u2019s acidity and temperature and reduces oxygen, said Garc\u00eda. The plant is also poisonous for some coral reefs, local fauna and fish. \u201cThe reef is ailing because for the past 40 years we\u2019ve been throwing nutrients into the sea \u2013 and now you\u2019re delivering a body blow. In six months we\u2019ve lost 30% of the reefs in the Mexican Caribbean.\u201d President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador has downplayed the problem, while tourism secretary Miguel Torres M\u00e1rquez tweeted a video of a pristine Canc\u00fan beach with the comment: \u201cWe\u2019re looking after Canc\u00fan, \u2018our blue-eyed girl\u2019 and all the beautiful beaches of the Mexican Caribbean.\u201d But such optimism is harder to find on the beaches. \u201cFighting sargassum is a chore every day,\u201d Cancun mayor Mara Lezama told the AP. \u201cYou clean the beaches in the morning, and sometimes you clean them again in the afternoon or at night, and then you have to go back and clean it again.\u201d Officials in Puerto Morelos say they\u2019ve been proactive \u2013 hiring cleanup crews, setting up barricades and sending a boat out to sea to scoop up sargassum. But cleaning up the sargassum inadvertently removes sand, aggravating serious beach erosion. Canc\u00fan, Puerto Morelos \u2013 and most other major tourist resorts \u2013 are a former fishing settlements which have grown rapidly over the past 50 years \u2013 a process in which economic growth was prioritized over environmental concerns. Tourism accounts for approximately 8% of Mexico\u2019s GDP, but local business owners expressed concern that the sector may be threatened by the sargassum blight. Regional occupancy rates are running behind last year\u2019s pace and room rates have dropped nearly 20%, according to the business magazine Expans\u00edon. \u201cI\u2019ve been in business 20 years and it\u2019s never been this slow,\u201d said Triny Ju\u00e1rez, a local restaurateur. Ju\u00e1rez has started sending her employees to join the cleanup crews rather wait tables or prepare food. But the sargassum always seems to return with a vengeance. \u201cYou can\u2019t compete with nature,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
