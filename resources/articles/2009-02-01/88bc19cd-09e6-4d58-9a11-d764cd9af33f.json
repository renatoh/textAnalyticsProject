According to the Sydney Daily Telegraph, Clarke wanted the team song to be sung by 11pm following the consolation third-Test win over the South Africans so that he could leave to spend time with family and friends. Instead, the traditional song \u2013 Under the Southern Cross I Stand \u2013 did not get an airing until midnight. \"Yes, we had a disagreement after the Sydney Test,\" Clarke told the newspaper. \"This kind of thing occasionally happens in cricket teams. We didn't see eye to eye on that night, but we have been team-mates at NSW (New South Wales) and Australia a long time. We've spoken since, including catching up the other night at the Allan Border Medal. There's no issue between us. We've all moved on.\" Katich said: \"I've spoken to Michael as recently as today and we're both big enough and old enough to have moved on. I'm not fussed about what happened. Michael and I are focused on some tough Test cricket that's coming up for Australia against South Africa in a couple of weeks.\" Both players escaped a fine from Cricket Australia, and a spokesman added: \"What happens between these guys is their business. They've sorted it and moved on.\" But the news does not come at a good time for Australia. Their aura has vanished in the last few months following Test-series defeats in India and at home to South Africa, and they were recently knocked off the top of the one-day world rankings after losing 4-1 to the South Africans. Last week, during a humiliating one-day defeat to New Zealand, their wicket-keeper Brad Haddin was accused of questionable sportsmanship by the New Zealand captain after he dislodged the bails with his gloves during the dismissal of Neil Broom."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
