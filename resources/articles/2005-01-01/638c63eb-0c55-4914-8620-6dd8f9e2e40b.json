Miles, who chose not to be legally represented at yesterday's hearing at the Club's offices in Shaftesbury Avenue, does not currently hold a jockey's licence, and will not be able to apply for a new one until July 27. He rode 35 winners last year, including Red Lancer in the Chester Cup, one of the season's major handicaps. He also partnered Boleyn Castle to victory in a valuable handicap at Ascot in July 2002. Miles, 23, said as he left the hearing that he is determined to return to race-riding, though he has lost his previous job as stable jockey to Terry Mills. \"I am pleased that the hearing is over and I understand what a serious offence this is,\" Miles said as he left the Jockey Club headquarters. \"I would like to issue a public apology, in particular to my former trainer Terry Mills and also to the other yards that have supported me. \"I now want to put this behind me and look forward to the future and I hope to apply for a job in racing as soon as possible.\" Miles was accompanied at the hearing by John Blake, the chief executive of the Jockeys Association. \"This has been a terrible time for Robert and I know how very embarrassed and ashamed he has been about the whole thing,\" Blake said. \"He had some circumstances in his personal life which led him to get involved in some things that he wishes he hadn't now. But more than anything, he wants to get back to the way of life he loves and the only way of life that he wants and that is to be a jockey. \"If that means that he has to go back to a yard and start again at the bottom so that he can get back into the swing of life in a stables then I think he's prepared to do that.\" The Club's official notice of the panel's findings said that it had accepted an admission that he was in breach of Rule 66(vii) of the Rules of Racing. It also informed Miles that the issue of a new rider's licence would be \"dependent upon his obtaining a satisfactory medical report from the Jockey Club Chief Medical Adviser.\" Miles is only the fourth rider to have tested positive for cocaine in the 10 years since the Jockey Club's testing regime was introduced in October 1994. Philip Shea was banned for six months in October 2000, while Francis Norton received a four-month suspension in December 2003. Dean Gallagher, who had already served a six-month ban imposed by the French authorities, was given an 18-month suspension for a second offence, this time in Britain, in November 2002."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
