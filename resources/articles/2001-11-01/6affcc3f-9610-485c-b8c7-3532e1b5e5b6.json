Akinbiyi decided to stay at Filbert Street after talks with his manager Dave Bassett, even though he has been the target of criticism from Leicester fans this season. The club's \u00a35m record signing scored his first Premiership goal of the season against Sunderland only 10 days ago but Bassett expressed his admiration for the way the player has reacted to his lean spell. Bassett said: \"I'm delighted that Ade has committed himself to us. The whole squad has been behind him, as you could see by the reaction when he scored against Sunderland, and they will also be delighted that he is staying. \"He had a chance to go back to Wolves on loan but he did not think that was the right move and he is determined to prove his worth with us by scoring the goals that will keep us in the Premiership. \"He had to take some stick a few weeks ago but he is coming through that and I am delighted because you don't like to see someone pilloried and criticised that much. I've got nothing but praise for the dignity he has shown and his attitude has been very good.\" Southampton are understood to have made an approach for the Tottenham midfielder Tim Sherwood, who this season has struggled to force his way into the first team at White Hart Lane. Sherwood has been a victim of Tottenham's recent run of form which yesterday saw their manager Glenn Hoddle given the Barclaycard manager of the month award for October after wins over Derby County, Newcastle United and Middlesbrough. The Leeds defender Rio Ferdinand was named player of the month. Ferdinand's international team-mate Gareth Southgate hopes to recover from the injury he picked up against Sweden in time to line up for Middlesbrough against his former club Aston Villa on Saturday. West Ham are giving a week's trial to the highly rated Swedish goalkeeper Dime Jankulovski, who plays for Vastra Frolunda in the Swedish league. Manchester United have rearranged their Premiership match against Liverpool at Old Trafford from Easter Monday, April 1, to January 22. This will allow both clubs more time to prepare for possible Champions League quarter-final ties on April 2 or 3."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
