It was the weirdest packing I'd ever done for a holiday, but at least it was ea sy to recognise other members of our party at the airport. They were the ones with the strange - shaped luggage: bubble-wrapped spades and hoes, kneeling pads, garden shears and loppers. We were an organic gardening brigade on our way to dig city vegetable plots in Havana, and in so doing to help Cuba survive the United States economic embargo, with which the most powerful nation in the world hopes to intimidate the most obstinate. I expected my fellow organic embargo-busters to be chisel-jawed men and rosy-cheeked, head-scarved women out of a Fifties constructivist poster. Alas, no. We were all surprisingly ordinary: dietician, therapist, artist, designer, maintenance man and a dozen more, including three professional gardeners. Top of the age range were the brigadistas for whom the Cuban revolution once represented a romantic revolutionary ideal, or at least a poster of Che Guevara on some 1968 student bedroom wall. At the younger end were those for whom the triumph of Fidel Castro's revolutionaries in 1959 is now as ancient a piece of history as the Russian Re volution. Their commitment was to a better organic world - and maybe also to Havana's legendary nightlife. For whatever reason, we were on our way to Havana to work in the capital's huertos, small urban vegetable plots, and to dance a bit, drink and swim from beautiful beaches. Jet-lagged and culture shocked, our first serious problem was the least expected: the weather. We hit a rare cold patch, cold enough for us to wear fleeces and jackets intended only for the cold British end of the journey. The first morning, I wandered down to the nearest bit of seafront, a ghost town of a Fifties holiday resort, with an empty swimming pool, crumbling concrete balustrades and run-down hotels. A furious sea was thumping waves on to the potholed promenade, leaving in its wake bulbous blue creatures which turned out to be Portuguese men-of-war. I am not brave about jellyfish. This wasn't quite the Caribbean idyll I'd had in mind. Lesson one: don't go to Cuba with fixed ideas. A couple of days later, shovelling compost into black plastic bags and planting saplings in a fruit tree nursery, I started to warm up. Since these were destined for city plots to provide food and/or medicine, it felt useful. Carlos, the fruit farmer, beamed with pleasure at our labour. The sun, and a different Cuba, started to emerge. We fell into a pattern: a bit of digging in a huerto, or organic farm, usually with some talk about Cuba's organic revolution or herbal medicine triumphs. We did a lot of listening. Cubans can really talk. And they love you for listening, maybe because they feel strongly that the rest of the world isn't. It is barely 10 years since Cuba lost four-fifths of its income with the collapse of the Soviet bloc economies. The impact was felt most keenly in the food sector: Cuba imported more than half its calorific intake, and was particularly dependent on imported protein. Even the food that Cuba grew herself needed fertilisers and pesticides, 80 per cent of them imported. The urgent problem was to feed Havana, whose 2.5 million residents were 20 per cent of the population. Without the chemicals, yields dropped dramatically. In the mid-Nineties there were food riots, and thousands of people tried to flee abroad. But Cuba has slowly recovered. Overall, food production in Havana grew from 40,000 tonnes in 1995 to 115,000 in 1998, all of it organic. We are here to make a tiny contribution, and to listen. But the evenings are for music and mojitos (a cocktail of rum, lime, sugar and mint leaves). Music is everywhere and almost always excellent. Modern disco music has been banished to the tourist resorts, so the sounds of central Havana are the traditional son, rumba, danzon and bolero - sounds that, thanks to Ry Cooder and the Buena Vista Social Club, the entire Western world has now gone mad for. One night four or five of us followed our ears and found what appeared to be a Buena Vista tribute band of eight elderly men, one of whom seemed frighteningly close to keeling over as he performed a spirited solo dance. After playing the obligatory 'Chan Chan' - now almost Cuba's second national anthem - the group had a break and a concerned lady friend took the dancing man's pulse and solicitously fed him a cake. We bought their CD, which they all signed with shaky signatures, telling us they hoped to be at Ronnie Scott's in London in the summer, so watch out for Ren\u00e9 Son. At about 11pm, as the rest of Havana started to emerge for dancing, the band ambled off. Another night, when the waves were crashing over the sea defences on to the Malecon, Havana's waterfront promenade - in normal weather, this is where young lovers sit listening to the soft lapping of the tropical sea below - we returned to explore the nightlife of our own sleepy suburb of Miramar. I later learnt that Castro and his student revolutionary buddies used to meet in Miramar to plot the overthrow of Batista. Inland from our hotel we found ourselves among the posher houses. 'There won't be any music here - they wouldn't allow it,' I said with total certainty. That was the cue for a dramatic drum burst and flashing lights. We turned up a drive into a magical garden party with a full-blooded dance band and a fabulously robed, deep-throated black woman singer,who strutted among the audience punctuating her singing with a commentary. We paid nothing, though such a venue could cost up to $40 in town, and the dancing went on for hours. We wouldn't have grudged paying, but the hunger for dollars elsewhere is beginning to corrupt. When the average doctor or fruit farmer earns only $5 (about \u00a33) a week, it feels wrong to hand over two or three weeks' salary just to dance. So far, Cuba lives with these contradictions mainly by keeping tourists and Cubans apart. But why would you choose to visit such an inefficient, crumbling country with its shortages and cold snaps and jellyfish and poor service if it weren't for the people? The best thing about visiting Cuba is meeting and working with the proud, stubborn and witty people that so infuriate the giant across the water. And the music...
