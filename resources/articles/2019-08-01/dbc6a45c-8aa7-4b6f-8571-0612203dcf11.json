Religious leaders have been invited to the event for what is expected to kickstart a period of public consultation on the Coalition\u2019s proposed bill, which Porter has indicated he wants passed through the parliament by the end of the year. The chief minister of the great synagogue, Rabbi Benjamin Elton, said he was \u201chonoured and delighted\u201d to be hosting Porter, saying religious discrimination was an important issue for the Jewish community, as it was for other religious groups. \u201cThe Great Synagogue has always played a role as being an interface between the Jewish community and the greater community and I am very proud to be continuing that tradition,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is now time for all communities, for people of faith and for people not of faith to get involved and to view the exposure draft, comment on it, and make it a really significant public conversation so that we get to a final result that the whole community is happy with.\u201d The release of the bill comes as the government resists calls from religious groups for a positive religious \u201cfreedom\u201d bill, which would go further than a typical anti-discrimination act and enshrine positive rights of religious practice. Porter has rejected such a move but the idea is being pushed by Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce and Liberal conservative Concetta Fierravanti-Wells. Religious groups had also been pushing for the bill to include explicit protections for organisations, a move that is being opposed by LBTQI groups. Porter has indicated the bill will follow the \u201cvery standard architecture\u201d of other anti discrimination laws which will define religious belief as a protected attribute in the same way federal law prohibits racial and sexual discrimination. Labor\u2019s shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, said the government had not allowed proper scrutiny of the bill and it was \u201clong past time the government came clean with just what it has planned here\u201d. \u201cThe Liberals have been arguing about religious discrimination for more than two years but appear to want to give the rest of the country just weeks to debate it,\u201d Dreyfus told Guardian Australia. \u201cAll Australians have a right to take part in this debate, not just the Liberal party. The whole community should be given the chance to properly scrutinise what\u2019s being proposed and not have this rushed through parliament because of the government\u2019s internal divisions.\u201d The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has indicated he wants Labor\u2019s support for the proposed changes, saying he does not want the issue of religion to divide the community. After cabinet signed off on the proposed draft legislation last week, Morrison said he wanted to consult with \u201call Australians\u201d about the draft legislation. \u201cI\u2019m sure this will be a very informative and consultative process and enable us get to the next phase,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an issue that I think should be bringing Australians together, not one that does the opposite.\u201d Elton said that many religious groups saw the discrimination act as a good first step but wanted more changes to be made following a review by the Australian Law Reform Commission into the framework of religious exemptions that exist within other anti discrimination laws. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t solve every problem, but it is a step in the right direction.\u201d Next week, the ALRC will release a discussion paper on its proposals, which will deal with exemptions that may permit religious schools to discriminate in relation to staff and students on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, or relationship status provided that certain conditions are met. The government tasked the ALRC to consider legislative reforms that would limit or remove religious exemptions to prohibitions on discrimination, while also guaranteeing \u201cthe right of religious institutions to conduct their affairs in a way consistent with their religious ethos\u201d. The recommendations arose out of a review into religious discrimination undertaken by former Liberal MP Phillip Ruddock commissioned by former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull after the parliament agreed to legalise same-sex marriage."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
