This golfer, who derives ongoing inspiration by what he perceives as a lack of due recognition, was at it again in the lead up to the Masters. Beware the chippy champion. After the leading Golf Channel analyst and former tour player Brandel Chamblee publicly accused Koepka of professional recklessness by losing substantial weight for a photoshoot, a sharp rebuke appeared on social media. \u201cIf working out ruins careers, what ruined yours?\u201d asked Koepka. Ouch. A more meaningful retort arrived on Thursday at Augusta National. Koepka, playing in what should have been the most testing of round one conditions, strode to the head of the field by producing a 66. The last time he appeared here, in 2017, he was the 25th-ranked player in the world and without a major title. Having missed the last Masters due to injury, Koepka has returned to Georgia as the holder of both the US Open \u2013 which he successfully defended \u2013 and US PGA Championship. He has been a world No 1. And still, handily it seems, Koepka carries a sense of grievance. In proving that it does indeed take all swinging sorts, Bryson DeChambeau has a different approach entirely; to everyone. Golf\u2019s mad scientist almost holed his second shot to the 18th but instead tapped in to match Koepka\u2019s six-under-par tally. This was DeChambeau\u2019s lowest Masters round, by five. Koepka and DeChambeau hold an advantage of one over Phil Mickelson who, at 48, is seeking to become the oldest winner of a major. Ian Poulter and Dustin Johnson signed for 68s. Tiger Woods is not accustomed to particularly robust Masters starts. When plotting his way towards four previous victories at Augusta, Woods had never made an opening round better than 70. His only 60s Masters Thursday, now in 22 attempts, arrived when he appeared at his least equipped, in 2010 just months after an altercation with a fire hydrant preceded an outpouring of scandal relating to Woods\u2019s private life. In setting up Masters wins of 1997, 2001 and 2002, Woods\u2019s Thursday scorecards showed 70 shots. 11 April 2019: Woods opens the 83rd Masters with a 70. \u201cThat was a grind,\u201d he admitted. Nobody \u201cgrinds\u201d better than Woods. At quarter past three Augusta time, he became the joint leader on account of an outrageous birdie at the 14th. Woods found trees with his tee shot, from where he towered an approach shot to 25ft. As the putt was converted, roars \u2013 Tiger roars, an enhancement on all others \u2013 reverberated around Augusta. This proved a controlled Woods performance. But for trouble on the greens \u2013 and even they weren\u2019t serious in context of a generally tricky day \u2013 the 43-year-old would have posted a lower number. Woods, for example, missed from just 5ft for a birdie two at the 6th. He dropped from three to two under courtesy of a similar aberration at the 17th. Yet from tee to green, the 14-times major champion was excellent. \u201cI feel very good,\u201dsaid Woods. \u201cI played well today and I controlled my golf ball all day. I\u2019ve shot this number and won so hopefully I can do it again.\u201d The notion that two inches of rain dumped on Augusta early in Masters week would trigger low scoring proved unfounded. Course setup was key to that; pin positions were generally dicey. Putting, tough enough at the Masters at the best of times, entered Rubik\u2019s Cube territory. A log-jammed leaderboard, akin to nearby Washington Road, was emphasised by the afternoon spell which saw a nine-way tie for the lead. Matters had become only marginally less congested by dusk. Adam Scott, the 2013 champion, Kevin Kisner and Jon Rahm were among five players to score 69. Rory McIlroy was two over par when taking to the 13th tee. The Northern Irishman clawed things back from there when moving to one under par thanks to a 35ft putt at the 16th. However, McIlroy finished poorly with bogeys at the closing two holes. McIlroy\u2019s latest quest to complete a grand slam started with a 73, about which he looked far from amused. Patrick Reed\u2019s championship defence began with the same score as McIlroy. Sergio Garc\u00eda, who triumphed in 2017, also sits at one over. Henrik Stenson\u2019s 74 was reasonable given the almighty mess he made of the 13th, from which he walked off with a triple-bogey eight. Tommy Fleetwood conceded he \u201a\u201cstruggled\u201d for the last 10 holes of his 71. There were, inevitably, traumatic Thursdays. Jordan Spieth\u2019s 75 epitomised his recent form. More surprising was Justin Rose returning the same number, not to mention Paul Casey\u2019s 81. Ian Woosnam\u2019s Augusta days are numbered to the point where it would be no shock if the Welshman, the champion in 1991, bids farewell after round two. Woosnam slipped to a Thursday 80. That was, however, two strokes better than the 2009 winner and 2013 runner-up Angel Cabrera. \u2018The Duck\u2019 waddled off, stage left."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
