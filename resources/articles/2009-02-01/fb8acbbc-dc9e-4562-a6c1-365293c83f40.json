Clint Dempsey heading home a Simon Davies' corner to cancel out Jason Scotland's opener before Davies provided a perfect cross for Zamora to score his second goal in as many games. While Zamora may have recorded his first league goal since September here against West Bromwich Albion on Sunday Scotland is a striker who is truly in form and he showed wonderful close control on 12 minutes, turning Aaron Hughes on the edge of the box and drawing a full-length save from Mark Schwarzer, who nearly palmed the ball to Nathan Dyer. The Championship side dominated the opening half hour, showing they were far from cowed by their loftier opponents, passing slickly, seemingly unperturbed by Roy Hodgson's attempts to stifle their five-man midfield with the defensively-minded central pairing of Dickson Etuhu and Olivier Dacourt. A deflected free-kick from Jordi G\u00f3mez was saved by Schwarzer, who again had to act quickly to stop the rebound being finished by the nippy and opportunistic Dyer. Fulham looked most dangerous on the counter and had Zamora managed to control the ball in a more timely fashion after Davies ran 60 yards his shot might not have been so comfortably dealt with by Dorus de Vries. The Dutchman was flying minutes later when Erik Nevland met Zamora's intelligent header with a stinging volley. Fulham were well on top come the end of the first half and Zamora jumped highest for a Davies' corner only to see his powerful header strike the crossbar. Scotland fired a warning shot across Fulham's bows after 10 seconds of the second half and less than two minutes later Scotland put the visitors in front, rounding off a swift move down the left involving Alan Tate and Mark Gower with the authority of a man hitting the net for the fifth time in five games, stabbing the ball under a rapidly advancing Schwarzer. Fulham could have responded post-haste, but Nevland wildly hacked at the ball when he found space in the area. Dempsey's curling 20-yard effort minutes later may have been more elegant but it was similarly off target. Fulham gained further traction with the introduction of Danny Murphy for the injured Dacourt and Zoltan Gera for Nevland. Swansea were content to sit back and hit Fulham on the break \u2013 Scotland again placing London hearts in mouths with a snap shot before De Vries broke them with a remarkable triple save, twice from Zamora and once from Dempsey. But the American was not to be denied and neither was Zamora."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
