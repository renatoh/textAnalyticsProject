The budget Ironically, given talk of an early budget is behind much of the election speculation, the budget bottom line won\u2019t itself be a massive issue. Sure there\u2019ll be talk of debt and deficit and the usual \u201cneed to live within our means\u201d idiocy, but it\u2019s hard to see the government going big on debt given under their watch it has continued to grow: The rush to surplus is tough when revenue doesn\u2019t grow faster than you expect. And historically, you also need revenue to be growing by over 7% each year \u2013 something we\u2019re not expecting to see until 2018-19: The recent increases in iron ore prices may help things a little, but given the sharp falls in the past couple days you wouldn\u2019t want to bet on it \u2013 especially as major mining companies such as BHP have struggled mightily this year. That means the only way to cut debt and get back to surplus is through very sharp spending cuts \u2013 something that would be tough to sell without evoking memories of Hockey 2014. Taxes The budget bottom line might not be a big issue, but taxation will be. Obviously the GST change is gone, but the government looks likely to introduce some superannuation changes, but just how big they will be is open to question, especially given they have stepped away from anything major thus far. But if they are going to cut spending on services such as dental care and welfare, then they also need to be seen to hit the wealthy, and super is the most obvious place to do so. Scott Morrison has also talked at various volume levels about income tax cuts to alleviate bracket creep. Such a move might see the ALP need to counter, but as any tax cuts will likely be funded by spending cuts elsewhere, the ALP will likely not mimic in that manner. The ALP will also run hard on multinational tax avoidance. They will likely overplay the amount of revenue that can be garnered but as the US Presidential election has shown, suggesting multinationals haven\u2019t been playing fair is a winning proposition. Housing affordability Of course the big tax debate at the moment is over negative gearing and capital gains tax changes. Fortunately the Liberal party has taken the mature, rational approach, such as when Peter Dutton suggested that the ALP\u2019s policy would mean \u201cthe economy will come to a shuddering halt\u201d and \u201cthe stock market will crash\u201d. But back on planet earth, the issue is all about housing affordability. It\u2019s clear the Liberal party will run hard on its scare campaign \u2013 having gone all in, it can\u2019t stop now \u2013 but it will also need to talk about what it can do to improve the ability for first-time home buyer to get into the market. It will likely try to put a cap on the amount individuals can claim on negative gearing, but that policy seems more about shifting who benefits from negative gearing rather than actually doing anything about housing affordability. There are a number of ways to measure housing affordability, but one I like compares the average size of a home loan to average full-time income. On this measure there has been a sharp increase in the past 3 years: And while the Prime Minister is correct to surmise that people do worry about the value of their home, they also worry about the ability of their kids to be able to buy one as well, and right now first home buyers are almost at record low levels: Infrastructure As soon as you talk housing, you also need to talk infrastructure \u2013 roads, bridges, rail \u2013 to not only deal with congestion but also to improve productivity. Malcolm Turnbull is already on the issue with his speech last Friday on the need for rail links to the new Badgerys Creek airport. The election will see the usual infrastructure promises. But will political parties limit themselves to the confines of the budget deficit parameters? Or will any be brave enough to note governments can now borrow at record low interest rates, and maybe it is time to make use of them? And can anyone make an announcement without sounding like it is from a script of Utopia? Job, jobs, jobs The talk of infrastructure will also be about jobs, which in the end is pretty much the main economic game come election time. Sure people might get a bit excited about debt and deficit, but mostly the economy means jobs \u2013 is my job secure, and for parents, whether their children be able to get a decent job when they leave school. This latter issue is mostly under the surface at the moment \u2013 and certainly not as front and centre as it currently is in the US presidential election \u2013 perhaps because places like Whyalla don\u2019t have the population of Detroit. One problem for the campaign is that employment growth around the country is quite wildly spread. In NSW it\u2019s going great; Queensland is on the rise, and Victoria, while doing okay, is not doing as well as it was 12 months ago, and it\u2019s awful in South Australia and Western Australia: This situation is exaggerated with full-time work \u2013 NSW is doing well; the rest of the nation, not: And this relative weakness in full-time employment growth around the country also has seen increases in the level of workers who are underemployed. There is a higher percentage of workers underemployed in each state than there was at the last election \u2013 most pointedly in South Australia and Western Australia: So while the employment is doing okay \u2013 and the unemployment rate is basically where it was in 2013 \u2013 jobs will remain an issue because there are enough signs that we are nowhere near full capacity. There\u2019s still plenty of people looking for work and looking for more work. Pay and conditions And those who do have work certainly are not seeing any sort of pay growth: New South Wales, which is having the best employment growth, has one of the worst wages growth in the country. And this is where the big issue of the election campaign will be \u2013 especially from the ALP side \u2013 wages and conditions. If Turnbull calls a double dissolution on the Registered Organisations Bill and the Australian Building and Construction Commission legislation then industrial relations is forced into the spotlight in a very central manner. Voters might not be fully across the two issues, but they certainly are across pay and penalty rates. WorkChoices died a miserable death when the unemployment rate was at 4.3%, compared to the current level of 6%, and wages were rising at 4.0% compared to the current rate of 2.0%. The economy is already undergoing massive changes due to the end of the mining boom. Arguing we need more change to an IR system which has shown ample flexibility and at a time where workers\u2019 standard of living is falling would require a level of salesmanship I have yet to see from this government. Throw in climate change via the ALP\u2019s emissions trading scheme and you probably have the economic debate covered. It\u2019s a fairly unwieldy mess. No one state looks much like another, and political parties need to promise better times in a period when the entire world is experiencing slow growth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
