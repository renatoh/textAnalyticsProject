Romanian President Traian Basescu has declared that all domestic journalists reporting from Turkey's avian flu hit areas will be isolated as soon as they return home. Mr Basescu made the statement after the recent cases of avian flu in humans were announced in Turkey and local television stations sent their correspondents to report on the outbreak. The president said: \"Turkey has not tackled avian flu very carefully, unlike Romania. \"Look at all those journalists who arrived at the scene and reported from right in front of the house where those three people died due to bird flu. What I can tell you is that those journalists will enter quarantine as soon as they return to the country.\" Mr Basescu specifically referred to television news correspondent, Mirela Voicu, who was the first Romanian journalist to reach the eastern Turkey province of Dogubeyazit where three children from one family died from the disease. He said: \"The correspondent got into the avian flu area far too easily. Turkish officials should have imposed much stricter measures once the first cases occurred.\" Over 30 villages in Romania have been put under quarantine since September and journalists have only been allowed in if they are wearing a mask and get sprayed with disinfectant afterwards, though a number were caught sneaking in. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
