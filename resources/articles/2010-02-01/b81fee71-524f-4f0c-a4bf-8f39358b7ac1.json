Now reunited \u2013 with a rejigged line-up \u2013 they have obviously been stockpiling an abundance of creative urges. This sprawling double album features a whopping 20 songs, divided into four separate segments. If the structure has a whiff of the prog rock magnum opus about it, the music follows suit. Paul McCartney's influence looms large on the more melodic moments. Several tracks set up an unlikely meeting between angular Sunderland peers Futureheads and mid-70s Wings, and the beautifully orchestrated Measure could be a lost outtake from Abbey Road. But the album loses its way in an odyssey of soft rock, Mesureshifting time signatures and Supertramp-esque twiddles. Sublime moments \u2013 the lovely piano riff on The Rest Is Noise, the rueful Precious Plans and \"oh to be young again\" cry of Curves of the Needle \u2013 battle to find a way out of prog-rock hell."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
