Ganley's late entry to the debate will boost the campaign for a no vote against Ireland ratifying the EU reform programme. An opinion poll published today in Dublin showed support for a yes vote in next month's referendum was increasing. The Sunday Business Post/Red C poll found 62% intended to vote yes, with 23% voting no and 15% remaining undecided."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
