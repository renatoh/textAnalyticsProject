He'd served three years for armed robbery while still a teenager, before becoming one of the greatest of the first wave of rockers. Like Jerry Lee Lewis, though, his sexual mores were not to the taste of many others, and in January 1962, he was sentenced to three years for transporting a 14-year-old waitress across a state line for immoral purposes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
