A democracy relies on informed citizens making a reasoned choice. Yet the likes of Cambridge Analytica, whose techniques will only intensify in their effectiveness and creepiness, risk destroying this foundation. In the business world, regulations such as the general data protection regulation, the payment services directives and ePrivacy are being enforced to foster trust, transparency and control of the commercial use and collection of personal data. It is imperative that this regulatory approach is now applied to political campaigning, where use (and misuse) of personal data has the potential to decide elections, swing referendums and, ultimately, shape history. Liz Brandt CEO, Ctrl-Shift London WC2 I too am concerned about the mounting and possibly pernicious influence of the IT companies and the plutocrats who control them. However, is there any hard evidence that the referendum was actually \u201chijacked\u201d? Has anyone identified the \u201cpersuadable\u201d people who were allegedly bombarded with a billion ads in the few days before the Brexit vote and who, presumably, were pivotal in swinging it ? If identified, have they confirmed that they were so persuaded? Surely the Remain camp also had access to vast tranches of data and made full use of social media. Steve Wheeler Bebington, Merseyside The myths of childbirth It seems women are viewed as little more than receptacles (Leah McLaren, \u201cI can\u2019t forget the horror of my son\u2019s birth\u201d, Magazine). Virtue seems to be attributed to suffering in silence and any attempt to avoid it using medical advances is \u201cunnatural\u201d. I understand the reaction against the overly medicalised model of previous decades, but it looks to me like the pendulum has swung too far in the opposite direction. Women are effectively silenced and shamed by bodies such as the National Childbirth Trust, which (based on many accounts from friends) pressures women into refusing pain relief, leading to feelings of failure. The myth that childbirth is routinely a serene experience, rather than a potentially traumatic ordeal, leaves women inadequately prepared. Getting an elective caesarean on the NHS is virtually impossible. Women need to be able to make well-informed and safe choices and to get thorough physical and psychological support to recover from trauma when it occurs. Name and address to come Local action on air pollution The new government plan to reduce air pollution has come in for a fair bit of criticism (News). However, and while we wait for a possible improved version, people can make use of what it contains. Particularly, we can encourage councils to take serious note of the recommendation for clean air zones and the suggestion that they \u201cachieve compliance within the shortest time possible\u201d. Perhaps a local illustration will help. Based on 2010 figures, we learn that Spelthorne, where I live, has large amounts of particulates. These are tiny bits of liquids or solids in the air. They settle in the airways and, as your science and technology section points out, cause premature death and aggravate heart and lung disease. It follows that this borough has one of the highest death rates attributable to air pollution in the UK. It is to be hoped councils everywhere take serious note of the report and, where appropriate, put measures in place speedily to follow the advice of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. To encourage them in this action, groups and political parties sympathetic to green issues have a particular role. The Rev Andrew McLuskey Staines Alliances can topple Tories Nick Cohen is wrong: this election has to be about changing the way we do politics(\u201cA progressive alliance is misbegotten and doomed\u201d, Comment). In this part of England, Simon Letts (Labour, Southampton Itchen), Jackie Porter (Liberal Democrat, Winchester) and Vix Lowthion (Greens, Isle of Wight) have the best chance of beating the Tories and Ukippers. They are all knowledgeable politicians who are trusted in their own communities and who have more in common than the things that divide them. The need for life-enhancing politics indicates that progressives of all parties should get behind them. Fighting each other simply opens the door to a larger Conservative majority, with the inevitable further disintegration of public services, increasing inequality and the perpetuation of the Tories\u2019 deeply irresponsible attitude to climate change. In particular, it would be great if Green party members in the south of England piled into the Isle of Wight, and, with the help of enlightened Lib Dem and Labour supporters, created a month-long carnival of politics seeking to persuade the islanders that, with a Green MP, they can lead the way to a safer planet. A few years ago, ecological activist David Green propagated an inspiring vision of a low-carbon economy on the Isle of Wight. Now, more than ever, that vision needs a political champion. Robert Hutchison Winchester Fighting for the NHS The NHS and social care are in a state of crisis. Hard-working, dedicated staff, who are fighting to provide high quality, compassionate care, are being undermined because these essential services are being woefully underfunded. As people who have worked for many years in the NHS, social care and related fields, we know the impact this is having on patients, and on staff morale, on a daily basis. The Government would like us to believe this can be fixed simply by asking services to find savings. But the NHS is already one of the most efficient health systems in the world. Cutbacks will not be enough to fix the deficit \u2013 not without harming patient care and causing untold damage to these vital services. The human cost of this crisis is already painfully clear. Waiting times are rising, there is particularly poor access for people with mental ill health and operations are being cancelled. More and more people are also unable to leave hospital following treatment because the follow-up care they need isn\u2019t available. Ultimately, all of these factors lead to poorer outcomes. For these reasons, we strongly welcome the Liberal Democrats\u2019 commitment to raise income tax by 1p, to generate additional, ringfenced revenue for NHS and social care. We also welcome their manifesto commitments to develop a long-term funding settlement for health and social care. Including bringing together funding into a dedicated, transparent NHS and care tax, establishing an independent body to advise on NHS and care budgets, and convening a cross-party convention on NHS and social care to work with patients, the public and staff, to deliver a sustainable funding settlement for NHS and care services. While some of us are supporters of the Liberal Democrat party, others are members of different parties, or of none. But it is our considered opinion, that whichever party you support, these measures will have a demonstrable benefit for NHS and social care services. We do not believe NHS and social care can continue to deliver high standards, and meet increasing demand, without more money. We hope that ahead of 8 June, all parties will set out similarly bold commitments to give the NHS and social care the funding it desperately needs.
