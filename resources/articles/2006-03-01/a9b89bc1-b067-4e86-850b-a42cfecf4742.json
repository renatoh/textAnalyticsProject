It still hasn't managed to give the piece proper accreditation. There's now a note that says \"Source: An Email...Friends say its in wikipedia too\", which is both pathetic and ridiculous. It's not \"in wikipeidia too\", it is taken directly from Wikipedia. That is the source, even if Day2Day Activities actually got it in good faith from somebody else. At the time, I found Day2Day's rip-off via a post on Guy Kawasaki's blog, The Name Game. Unfortunately it turns out that either Guy doesn't read his own comments or can't be bothered to provide correct attribution either. His post still starts with \"There's a great article called 'How they named companies' at the Day2Day Activities blog,\" and he hasn't published a correction in an addendum. As Wikipedia says: \"All of the information in Wikipedia is free for anyone to copy, modify for their own purposes, and redistribute or use as they see fit, as long as the new version grants the same freedoms to others and acknowledges the authors of the Wikipedia article used (a credit or backlink to the original article is sufficient for this).\" My emphasis. It's not copyright free information to be plundered at will, and sites like Day2Day Activities should not abuse things that are freely given."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
