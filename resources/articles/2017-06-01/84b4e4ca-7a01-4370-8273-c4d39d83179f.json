The Vermont senator \u2013 who narrowly failed to win his bid for the Democratic nomination against Hillary Clinton in the 2016 race for the White House \u2013 said he had watched the UK results coming in on Thursday and was very pleased about the party\u2019s showing. \u201cI am delighted to see Labour do so well,\u201d the Vermont senator said in a Facebook post, linking to a Guardian news story. He went on: \u201cAll over the world, people are rising up against austerity and massive levels of income and wealth inequality. People in the UK, the US and elsewhere want governments that represent all the people, not just the 1%. I congratulate Jeremy Corbyn for running a very effective campaign.\u201d Sanders voiced his support for Corbyn this month, drawing parallels between anti-establishment anger at both ends of the political spectrum in Britain and the US, and applauding the Labour leader\u2019s efforts to reshape the party. Organisers who worked on the Sanders campaign provided assistance to Momentum, the leftwing pressure group, in the runup to the election, coaching Labour members on how to canvass voters online and offline. Erika Uyterhoeven, a 30-year-old from Boston, told the Guardian that the lessons had focused on getting Labour activists in the right places, and getting the vote out. She said of the Sanders approach: \u201cThe right can throw money at elections. We throw people.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
