I just didn\u2019t feel safe enough", "bodyText": "I came out last year, just before my 34th birthday, as a bisexual woman. As a result, I regularly hear from people asking what they should do because they\u2019re getting older and, sometimes, are more frightened to come out. I understand. I wasn\u2019t sure what to do for a long time \u2013 I didn\u2019t know if I was going to be accepted or understood. As a 35-year-old who had been previously engaged to a cis man and as someone who could have never imagined being publicly happy with a woman or nonbinary person \u2013 I empathise. Coming out as bisexual \u2013 a misunderstood sexuality \u2013 added layers of insecurity and doubt. Will everyone think I\u2019m just seeking attention? Do I just need more Instagram likes to make this go away? Just because I think Zo\u00eb Kravitz is beautiful does that really equate to being queer? Why didn\u2019t you do this earlier? People look at me now, a vocal queer activist, and wonder what I\u2019ve been doing for the past 25 years. I get asked what it was like to \u201clive a lie\u201d. It wasn\u2019t a lie \u2013 I\u2019ve always known I\u2019m attracted to women, I just didn\u2019t feel safe enough to say it out loud. There\u2019s no denying the levels of doubt that enter your mind when coming out, but that\u2019s the reaction to years of conditioning \u2013 to be a good straight Indian wife to a straight Indian man. I knew deep down that I was attracted to more than just men, but I wasn\u2019t sure that it meant I was queer or that I could do anything about it. Yet as a straight-presenting queer, I had the privilege of taking my time in coming out. No one\u2019s attacked me before for being different or assumed my sexuality. Safety is the key here \u2013 no one can expect you to come out until you\u2019re ready, whether it\u2019s because of your family, religion, culture, work or mental health. If the next generation of young people are taught the concept of different sexualities and genders in an open and transparent way it will help with their journey. But while this debate continues, more people will suffer with mental health issues, some will come out later in their lives because they don\u2019t feel safe, many will harm themselves or be harmed by others. Although I want people to feel safe and comfortable before making any public announcements, I\u2019m also aware of the nature of the world we live in. Homophobic attacks are becoming more common, having more than doubled in England and Wales since 2014; our trans (especially black) brothers and sisters are being killed. When Ann Widdecombe publicly says that science \u201cmay produce an answer\u201d to being gay, she\u2019s telling people like me that it\u2019s not OK to come out. That there\u2019s something wrong with us. This narrative has run deep in my life \u2013 from family to the media. People around me have used \u201clesbian\u201d as a slur or the butt of a joke. The media gives a platform to homophobes. All this fuels uncertainty in the minds of LGBT+ people, it perpetuates mental health issues and creates a hostile environment for anyone considering coming out. It\u2019s vital we change that narrative. Don\u2019t let your friends call someone \u201cgay\u201d as an insult, don\u2019t let people make assumptions about someone\u2019s identity and don\u2019t try to out someone before they\u2019re ready to do it for themselves. Allies of the LGBT+ community need to create an environment of safety to allow us to feel welcomed. Understand that letting your children learn about all sexualities and genders won\u2019t instantly make them queer \u2013 that\u2019s not how that works. Children don\u2019t hear about Henry VIII killing his wives and go around murdering their partners. Education is important for the wellbeing of all communities \u2013 whether immigrant or LGBT+. It took years of work before I could allow myself to feel comfortable in my sexuality. I found that my openness and mental health came hand in hand. My mind told me I was worthless, and so I didn\u2019t believe my sexuality was of any importance. But part of my mental health issues were the result of the homophobia I had witnessed around me. I understand why it took me this long to come out, but perhaps if we can change the environment in which I grew up, it won\u2019t take others so long. \u2022 Sharan Dhaliwal is editor of Burnt Roti"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
