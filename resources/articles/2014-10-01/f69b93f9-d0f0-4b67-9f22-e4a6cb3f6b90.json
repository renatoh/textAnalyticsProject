It is the most popular sport in the world but, no matter how hard anyone has tried in recent years, it just won\u2019t catch on here like it does internationally. The same goes with variety shows. After perfecting the formula back in the 60s and 70s with greats like Ed Sullivan, Carol Burnett, and Sonny and Cher, no one has been able to replicate the magic of their heyday. Not to be deterred, Hollywood\u2019s favourite song and dance man Neil Patrick Harris is going to give it a whirl, even though plenty of others \u2013 Rosie O\u2019Donnell, Ellen DeGeneres, non-daytime-talk-show-lesbian Maya Rudolph \u2013 have tried and failed to make the format work. It was announced yesterday that NPH and UK television channel ITV (which most Americans know as the maker of Downton Abbey) are going to remake the super-popular British variety show Saturday Night Takeaway. While the show won\u2019t air on Saturday night, America\u2019s radioactive wasteland of programming, it will still feature a combination of sketches, hidden camera pranks, games, celebrity visitors, musical numbers, and probably Harris doing magic tricks. You know he can\u2019t resist a magic trick. Filmed in front of a live studio audience (as were Rosie\u2019s, Ellen\u2019s, and Maya\u2019s) Ant &amp; Dec\u2019s Saturday Night Takeaway is consistently one of the most popular shows in the UK, though like most British series, it only airs for six to seven episodes at a time, usually in the fall. No word yet on how many episodes Harris will do or how consistently, though his show won\u2019t begin until mid-2015 after Harris serves as Oscar host for the first time. These guys look like slackers compared to S\u00e1bado Gigante (Giant Saturday), a Chilean variety show that airs on Univision in the US, which has put on a show every Saturday since 1962, landing it the Guinness Book of World Records as the longest-running TV variety show. It looks like a variety show can be a big hit in the States, but maybe not an English-language one. Other Latin American countries have similar shows that combine talent contests, celebrity interviews and mock beauty pageants, like Venezuela\u2019s S\u00faper S\u00e1bado Sensacional. They are all known for their baritone-voiced hosts, colourful costumes, and an atmosphere so bright and exuberant it looks like Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve celebration. Asia has its own culture of variety shows, many of them featuring graphics and writing on the screen, gonzo sound effects, and non-stop banter. China\u2019s most popular variety show is called Happy Camp and its opening numbers can be described as, well, nothing but camp. It is the most similar to the types of variety shows you\u2019ll see in other parts of the world, but with the distinct flair that most Asian countries have borrowed from the Japanese progenitors of the genre. You can watch full episodes of the show on YouTube. Japan, famous for its wacky game shows, has a variety of variety programmes, but many of them feature stunts or contestants engaging in outrageous or sexual behaviour. Last year its show Orgasm Wars, where a gay dude tries to get a straight dude off using oral sex, was profiled on many American websites. One show, Downtown no Gaki no Tsukai ya Arahende!!, whose title translates to Downtown, This Is Not a Task for Kids, basically has \u201cdon\u2019t try this at home\u201d in the title. It\u2019s a combination of Jackass and a variety show. One of their most famous segments is called the Chinko Machine, where if the cast members get a question wrong a device pops up from the floor and hits them in the crotch. While there are plenty of colourful examples around the world, it\u2019s not like the States doesn\u2019t have more than its fair share of similar shows. Naturally a show like America\u2019s Got Talent is a variety show in its purest form, a collection of different acts wowing the audience with their unique skills. However, those shows have all become competitive reality shows, along with the likes of Dancing with the Stars, The Voice, and the dying carcass of American Idol, once the biggest show on television. It\u2019s updated the formula for the Kardashian Age, which is what our era of history will be known as in 2457. We do have a glut of celebrity-hosted variety shows like the one Harris plans and they are called nighttime talk shows, of which there are currently five airing five nights a week. What Jimmy Fallon is doing on NBC\u2019s revamped Tonight Show is what all these other shows also do, combining sketches, regular characters, musical games, and getting celebrities to do silly things you don\u2019t see them do normally, like playing egg Russian roulette with Bradley Cooper. Mostly, these days, we watch Fallon on YouTube. The ratings are still solid, but a new generation is consuming their variety shows on their favourite blogs. Instead of tuning in for an hour and seeing six segments, they\u2019re watching one segment, then clicking on related videos to watch five different segments from different shows, with maybe a leaked version of a new Beyonc\u00e9 song thrown in for good measure. Thanks to YouTube, Hulu and others, everyone gets to be the executive producer of their own variety show whenever they want. It makes sense that the networks want the variety show to succeed again because the only way they can seem to get people to watch television live and sit through all the commercials these days is through \u201cevent programming\u201d like sports games, award shows, and a live version of Sound of Music which was ripped apart in real time thanks to Twitter. But a variety show is going to have to be very special in order to become a true event. Harris\u2019s show, like Fallon\u2019s, is probably going to have its best bits disseminated on the web, thwarting the network\u2019s plan. That\u2019s what happened to Graham Norton when a clip from his show where John Cleese insulted Taylor Swift\u2019s cat made the rounds here in America. So, just like World Cup fever every four years, it is possible for international variety shows to break through in America \u2013 but only online."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
