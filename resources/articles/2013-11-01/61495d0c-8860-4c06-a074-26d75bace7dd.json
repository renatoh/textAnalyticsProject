The Football Association has made the bold decision to increase the amount of tournament football for England's young players and taken up the invitation to participate in the Toulon tournament, an event in which they have not competed since 2005. And far from talking up his players' chances of gate-crashing Roy Hodgson's squad for the World Cup finals, Southgate, the England Under-21 manager, believes the majority will benefit from taking on the likes of France, Chile and either Brazil or Argentina in a friendly event in southern France next May. England face Finland this Thursday in Milton Keynes and San Marino at Shrewsbury next Tuesday, with qualification for the play-offs of the 2015 European Under-21 Championship finals within reach after gaining 10 points from their opening four qualifiers. But Southgate and Dan Ashworth, the FA's director of elite development, have examined the issue of how England invariably qualify with some ease for Under-21 championships only to crash and burn \u2013 as in Denmark 2011 and Israel last summer. \"This will be a brilliant opportunity for the players,\" Southgate said at St George's Park. \"It's not a tournament we've taken part in for a number of years, possibly worrying about release of players and clashing with other tournaments, but we certainly feel in the years we don't have an Under-21 Euros, it's worthwhile. \"It's a different sort of challenge, where we'll have it all on to try and control possession in matches. The games come fairly quickly so it's an opportunity to give them all experience of a tournament. And we might well lose a couple of games, or we may go all the way, but either way, it'll be a really great experience.\" Southgate is not precluding the possibility of a Raheem Sterling, Jack Butland or Ravel Morrison breaking into the seniors, but is adamant a young team would be better prepared for future tournaments by going to one such as this. Ergo, Southgate has brought forward the final Euro 2015 qualifier of the season, away to Wales, to 19 May, to fit in with Toulon, even if he may end up losing players involved in Championship play-offs. \"I'd rather say we've got the guaranteed experience of going to a tournament here,\" he said. \"As a coach, I'll have to ride with that for the result against Wales. But I thought it was important, especially after I'd seen the first couple of games in this group, that we had a different challenge for these players.\" Southgate and Ashworth have already moved to head off the kind of club versus country disputes that tainted the last couple of years of Stuart Pearce's reign in charge of the U21s. \"All of the clubs I've visited so far \u2013 and we've got round most of the clubs \u2013 have been very positive about what we want to do,\" Southgate said. \"Because of the quality of the games that you're putting the players into, they see the value of that. There's an understanding of what we want to do.\" England, with a side including Jamie Redknapp, Robbie Fowler and Sol Campbell, won the Toulon tournament in 1994, but have prioritised the U21 Euros since that event was switched to odd years. However, Uefa are switching their official U21 event to clash with senior tournaments from 2016 and reducing it to four teams, so Toulon could regain precedence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
