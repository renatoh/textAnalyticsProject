Big Famous Literary Names this year include Philip Pullman, Seamus Heaney, and poet laureate Carol Anne Duffy, but more leftfield attendees include graphic novelist Alan Moore, of Watchmen and V For Vendetta fame, who can be relied upon for the kind of entertainingly deranged performance that Pullman et al are unlikely to give. Moore will be in conversation with Guardian cartoonist Steve Bell, a guest selector at the festival, who will be hosting similar events with his peers Martin Rowson and Garry Trudeau. A heavy stress is also being laid on the festival's Children's Programme, with authors such as Jacqueline Wilson sure to entice a few youngsters or nostalgic parents. Charlotte Square Gardens, Sat to 30 Aug, visit edbookfest.co.uk James Marshall Dippers &amp; Dunkers, Margate Growing from a weekend event to a week-long festival, this coastal celebration of sideshows, sunshine and a bit of sexiness harks back to a time when the seaside was saucy. The sideshow banners and seamed stockings may be from the 1950s, but the entertainment is bang up to date, with the Sassy Seaside Show offering the chance to enjoy burlesque sensations such as the Bears and Amber Topaz. The show also features a raft of magicians and dancers, with the week of events bringing markets, puppet shows, mermaids and giant insects to Margate's public spaces. Miss Maybe and Earl Okin also have solo shows. Various venues, Fri to 27 Aug, visit www.dippersanddunkers.org.uk Iain Aitch Worthing International Birdman Ever wished that you could fly? Then the International Birdman is for you, even if your attempts at aeronautics are more Orville the Duck than Orville Wright. The almost 40-year-old event sees aspiring Icaruses bounding off Worthing Pier, propelled only by non-motorised \"wings\" and an indifference to cold water. Serious aviators compete for the furthest flight, while wacky-winged fundraisers are awarded for \"entertainment value\". This year's celebrity entrants include Eddie \"The Eagle\" Edwards.
