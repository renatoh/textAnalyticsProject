While they danced warily around each other like two porcupines on a first date, Gordon Brown became more and more wound up. Shouting and gesticulating, the Chancellor could not conceal his evident frustration that the Prime Minister was failing to slaughter the new Tory leader at his first outing. Mr Blair did seem a bit disoriented by the match. Prepared for the Prime Minister beforehand and placed inside his folder was a barbed welcome with which to put down the young Tory pretender in their first exchange. Oddly, and to the surprise of members of the Cabinet, he forgot to use it. The Tory leader then knifed in a stinging pre-cooked line at Mr Blair's expense: 'He was the future once'. The Prime Minister offered some confirmation to those wanting to see him as past-it by failing to come back with a counter blast. An increasingly restive Chancellor started urging responses on the Prime Minister. Gordon Brown's agitation almost propelled him out of his seat, his body language saying to Blair: 'Out of the way, let me get at him.' To all the other things that divide the two men - and in many ways symbolising all those other differences - we can now add David Cameron. They differ in both their assessment of what he represents and how to respond to it. As a result, the Labour reaction to the advent of Cameron has been confused and lame. 'New gloss on same old Tories,' is the rather feeble holding line from the Government. This makes them sound like the hackneyed ones. The new Tory leader has had a dream start in the job. His margin of victory in the leadership contest - more than two to one over David Davis - gives him a thumping mandate to start forcing change on the Conservative Party. His acceptance speech was a success and even Labour MPs acknowledge that he put in an accomplished debut at Prime Minister's Questions. The slickly choreographed sequence of photo-opportunising and phrase-making since he became leader has told us little about where his Conservative party will end up. In his first week in charge of the Labour Party, Mr Blair made a series of policy announcements which decisively broke with Labour's past. He ruled out higher income taxes, he declared that two parents were better than one, and he over-turned Labour's education policy by accepting school league tables. Beneath the glitz and the hype of his first few days as Tory leader, Mr Cameron has proceeded cautiously. He has appointed a Shadow Cabinet not strikingly different to the one he inherited. He has announced a series of policy commissions, which is a way of avoiding having to put any actual policy into commission for the next 18 months. It is novelty that is intoxicating his party and much of the media, the novelty of having a Tory leader with a whiff of hope and a dusting of charisma about him. There was a time when the media gushed over Tony Blair because he could do a few headers on the football pitch. Now David Cameron is bathed in feel-good coverage for being able to ride a bicycle and smile at the same time. Stylistically at least, much of what Mr Cameron is doing is clearly borrowed from the Blair playbook in his initial phase as leader of the Labour Party. That is not the only reverse echo. Just as the early Tony Blair dazed and bewildered the Tories, so David Cameron is provoking a muddled and divided reaction from Labour. One view of the new Tory leader is that he can be negatively defined as a right-winger trying to pass himself off as a moderate. The 'compassionate Conservative' tag was first minted in America. On this reading, his true role model is not Tony Blair at all. His secret hero is George W Bush. He ran for the White House claiming to care. Once installed there, he turned into one of the most right-wing American Presidents in modern history. He will talk left, but act right. This is the perspective on Cameron that the Chancellor has already decided on. It is an interpretation of him that Mr Brown has been impressing on visitors to Number 11 for some weeks now. The Chancellor also has a fixed view about where Labour should draw the dividing line with the Cameron Tories. 'Money! Money!' Mr Brown yelled at Mr Blair during the exchanges about education, urging the Prime Minister to demand how the Tories would match Labour spending on schools. Mr Brown believes there is still life left in making the argument one between 'Labour investment' versus 'Tory cuts'. He and his adherents take a similarly formulaic view about how to deal with the new Tory leader as a personality. That is to cast him as Tory Boy, an inexperienced and light-weight toff. Tony Blair, being the product of the Eton of Scotland, is neither well positioned nor well disposed to attacking his opponent for being a public schoolboy. And he doesn't think it will work anyway. 'Who cares if Cameron is an Old Etonian?,' says one of the Prime Minister's allies in the Cabinet. 'It doesn't matter if he comes over as classless.' Mr Blair doesn't think Labour can continue to rely on the cry of 'Tory cuts'. He did not think that was the way to fight the last election, let alone the next one when Labour will have a 12 year record of spending to defend. The Prime Minister is telling his friends it is too early to take a fixed view about how to deal with the new Tory leader. It took him a while to get the measure of William Hague, he likes to recall. They should wait until David Cameron has started to define himself before they brand him. Otherwise, they may find themselves taking a line of attack and stuck in postures that don't ring true. The Chancellor is dismissive of the idea that Mr Cameron will successfully move the Tory party to the centre ground; the Prime Minister takes that proposition much more seriously. I suspect there are deeper, more psychological sources, for the differing feelings that David Cameron provokes in the Prime Minister and the Chancellor. It is natural for Tony Blair to want to believe that the Conservatives have finally produced a leader who will take them to the middle ground. The more the Tories seek to ape New Labour, the more Mr Blair and his legacy are flattered. He will be more comfortable retiring from Number 10 with the thought that his final triumph over the Tories has been to force them to emulate him. It is equally natural that Gordon Brown does not want it to be true that the Conservatives are finally grasping what they need to do to become competitive for the swing voters who determine the outcome of elections. Mr Blair does not have to fight another election. Mr Brown is planning to fight his first election as Prime Minister. A more centrist Tory party is going to be a Tory party which makes it harder for him to win. What does Tony Blair find when he looks across at David Cameron, a highly fluent, presentationally adept, only part-formed public school politician who has confounded much more experienced colleagues to take control of his party with astonishing speed and at a very young age? He must see rather a lot of himself as he was a decade ago. Perhaps that helps to explain the Prime Minister's reluctance to go immediately for the jugular of the new Tory leader. It would surely feel a bit like killing his young brother, even his younger self. By contrast, Gordon Brown once learnt a searing lesson about the consequences of failing to respond to the threat posed by a smooth and younger public school rival. Many years ago, it cost him the leadership of the Labour Party and the premiership. No wonder he is so desperate to strangle David Cameron at birth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
