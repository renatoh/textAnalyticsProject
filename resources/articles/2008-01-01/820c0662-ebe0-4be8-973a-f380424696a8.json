The report, by the Commons defence committee, says the cost of ambitious weapons projects continues to rise, while Britain's soldiers and pilots are finding it increasingly difficult to cope with the demands placed on them. It says the MoD must be \"realistic\" about what weapons systems it can afford. The problems are compounded by expensive delays in developing Nimrod reconnaissance aircraft, and in the Astute submarines and Type 45 destroyer programmes, which are already estimated to cost more than \u00a32bn more than originally forecast, the report notes. The choice facing ministers is limited since they have said that decisions to build a new four-boat Trident nuclear missile submarine fleet and two new aircraft carriers will not be overturned. The MPs say the ability of the armed forces to carry out the tasks officially demanded of them by the government causes them \"deep concern\". There is an overall shortage of manpower, more experienced personnel are leaving the forces early, and the continuing failure to meet \"harmony guidelines\" - the period that should be allowed for rest and training between operations - is \"unacceptable\", the MPs say. The defence minister, Bob Ainsworth, said last night he recognised that \"we are currently asking a lot of [the armed forces] in difficult and challenging circumstances\". He added: \"To achieve success we have had to take some risks, but by drawing down our commitments in Bosnia, Northern Ireland and Iraq, we can expect to see an improvement in meeting our harmony guidelines.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
