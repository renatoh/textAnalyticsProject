The Irish colt can gain compensation in the St James\u2019s Palace Stakes, the big race on the final day of Royal Ascot. Arizona had seemed to be Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s main contender but the market spoke in favour of Wichita and we saw why on the track. Pinatubo hit a flat spot at a crucial stage and may be better for the run but Wichita looks one to stick with and it would be a surprise if the form were reversed. Palace Pier has to be respected, as an unbeaten improver from the rampant John Gosden yard. 12.40 Tom Ward, who has been among the winners lately, was having just the fifth runner of his career when Dirty Rascal was fifth in a Listed race in September. He ran above his rating that day and has more to offer at the age of four, having twice shown his ability to cope with big-field contests. 1.15 Wesley Ward has been out of luck so far, the wet ground in midweek having been against a couple of his runners. But Campanelle is bred for European turf racing and must rate a very strong contender after showing masses of pace on her debut in Florida. 1.50 A powerful looking colt, Qaader may be able to seize this Coventry with a strong finish. Admiral Nelson deserves plenty of respect for the pace he showed at the Curragh but this is a different test. 2.25 Quadrilateral\u2019s third in the Guineas was an excellent effort, considering she had pulled as if her tail was on fire, but she\u2019s a short price. The Breeders\u2019 Cup winner Sharing makes plenty of appeal. She is the only runner who has had the perfect four weeks since her prep run but she needs the ground to keep drying. 3.35 Sceptical looks a potent threat but this is just his second race on turf, his first above Listed grade and the stiffest test of stamina he has faced. One Master had a few of these behind her when a slightly unlucky second in the sprint on Champions Day and she can cheer up a frustrating week for William Haggas. 4.10 Another chance is given to Summerghand, who was consistently good in big-field handicaps last year without winning one. He looks set for another good year, judging by his keeping-on second a fortnight back. 4.40 A weak race even by its own standards. Nate The Great needs to improve on his first outing for Andrew Balding but that seems likely and the trainer has won this twice before."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
