In the individual placings Funnell is lying second on a score of 31.40, only two points behind France's Nicolas Touzaint on Galan de Sauvag\u00e8re. Fox-Pitt, with Tamarillo, lies in sixth position. Funnell, who is favourite to win the individual gold medal here, was delighted with her performance on the big-striding Primmore's Pride, for which she was awarded the maximum mark of 10 by all three judges for the extended trot. This was a better test than they had performed at the Burghley and Kentucky last year, both of which they won. But Funnell may have trouble overtaking the 24-year-old Touzaint, who rode an impressive clear round on the cross country in Punchestown last year to win the European Championships. Fox-Pitt was also pleased with Tamarillo, an \"incredibly spooky\" horse, who was unfazed by the blustery wind, the billowing flags and the flowers in the arena yesterday. But Fox-Pitt thinks his score of 38.6 is \"bit off the pace individually\". Law's personal best performance on Shear L'Eau, for which he gives much credit to the team trainer Tracie Robinson, has put him in 10th place on a score of 41.40. The top three teams are separated by only 1.2 penalties - Britain on 113.2, France on 113.4 and Germany on 114.4 - so there is no room for error on today's cross country, which has been criticised for being too straightforward. Hugh Thomas, the director of Badminton, has described it as the easiest Olympic course he has ever seen, and Heidi Antikatzides, Greece's only representative in the eventing, said she is \"disappointed\" with it. But other riders have been more guarded. Funnell is concerned about the twists and turns towards the end of the 34-fence course, where a lot of jumps come in quick succession, and she regards the first water complex as \"a very serious fence\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
