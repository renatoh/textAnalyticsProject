The inquiry report confirmed that the dossier was prepared and drafted by a small team of the assessment staff of the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) - the most senior body in the intelligence services charged with assessment of intelligence. As the head of the JIC, overall responsibility for the drafting of the dossier lay with John Scarlett. The dossier, which included the 45 minutes claim, was issued by the government on September 24 2002 \"with the full approval of the JIC\", the report said, adding that it was based on a report received by the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) - a subservient body to the JIC - which agents judged to be reliable. Lord Hutton declared as unfounded an allegation in Andrew Gilligan's Today programme report that the 45 minutes claim was not in the June 20 draft because it came from only one source which the intelligence agencies did not fully trust. \"The reason why the 45 minutes claim did not appear in the draft assessments or draft dossiers until September 5 2002 was because the intelligence report on which it was based was not received by the SIS until August 29 2002,\" the report said. The report also suggested that claims of divisions between different agencies within the intelligence services were exaggerated. Dr Brian Jones, the head of the nuclear, chemical and biological weapons section of the Defence Intelligence Staff, had expressed concern about the wording of the dossier. But rather than amounting to an argument that the 45 minutes claim should not be included, Mr Jones's reservations were focused on the level of the language surrounding the claim, and he recommended the inclusion of phrase \"intelligence suggests\" to prefix it. The JIC decided not to take the recommendation on board. Alastair Campbell had made it clear to Mr Scarlett on behalf of the prime minister that No 10 wanted the dossier to be as strongly worded as possible, Lord Hutton said, and No 10 made written suggestions as to changes in the wording of the draft dossier. \"But Mr Campbell recognised, and told Mr Scarlett that 10 Downing Street recognised, that nothing should be stated in the dossier with which the intelligence community were not entirely happy,\" the report said, adding that Mr Scarlett accepted some changes while rejecting others. While clearly laying the responsibility for the content of September 2002 dossier at the feet of Mr Scarlett, Lord Hutton went on to acknowledge that pressure from No 10 may have affected its wording. \"I consider that the possibility cannot be completely ruled out that the desire of the prime minister to have a dossier which ... was as strong as possible in relation to the posed by Saddam Hussein's WMD may have subconsciously influenced Mr Scarlett and other members of the JIC to make the wording of the dossier somewhat stronger than it would have been if it had been contained in a normal JIC assessment,\" the report said. Lord Hutton declared himself satisfied, however, that \"Mr Scarlett, the other members of the JIC and the members of the assessment staff engaged in the drafting of the dossier were concerned to ensure that the contents of the dossier were consistent with the intelligence available to the JIC\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
