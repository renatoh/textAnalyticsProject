What people might not realise is that this belongs to a TV genre. Let\u2019s call it Drunk Horny Proles, examples of which are Geordie Shore, Ex on the Beach, Ibiza Weekender. It has been happening for some time, and it basically revolves around volatile, inebriated young people either arguing, or having on-screen sex. So basically, it\u2019s a form of sneak porn, featuring sexual footage, usually pixelated, sometimes with sheets thrown over the participants (though it\u2019s obvious what\u2019s happening). Perhaps better to call it gutless porn \u2013 porn for people who are up for a bit of titillation but are perhaps too scared to watch real porn. By which I mean porn performed by, one hopes, professionals who are properly remunerated. Professionals who, at the very least, know what they\u2019re getting into, and who\u2019ve processed how participating in porn may affect them, both now and for the rest of their lives. So, here\u2019s my question: could the people behind the lucrative television genre of gutless porn shows honestly claim the same about their participants? Some might say that I\u2019m just too old/frigid/jealous, to understand why these shows are \u201cjust a laugh\u201d. Fine, I\u2019ll take old (frigid too, if you insist), but jealous? No chance. My own youthful exploits could get (ahem) a tad unladylike, especially when I was trashed, but at least (thank Christ!) no one filmed me \u2013 there\u2019s no embarrassing indelible footage following me around, stinking up my life. This is what\u2019s so worrying, just like revenge porn is worrying \u2013 it isn\u2019t about denying anybody sexual agency, or pearl-clutching at what the yoof are getting up to. (I couldn\u2019t care less.) It\u2019s the fact that it\u2019s filmed, and likely to be around for ever. Is there a class element to this? You betcha. The Love Island lot \u2013 one of whom is almost posh totty \u2013 are rather grand compared with some of the other shows. Put it this way, it never seems to be \u201cPortia, barrister\u2019s daughter\u201d giving the blow job under the sheet, or \u201cTristan, Oxbridge-bound\u201d, who\u2019s receiving it. Nor do you get to see the (posher) Made in Chelsea lot screwing. In fact, this lower rung of reality TV makes even The Only Way is Essex resemble Brideshead Revisited. From what I can glean, it\u2019s only working-class people publicly bonking for the nation\u2019s entertainment on these uber-sexualised reality shows. And while one imagines that waivers are signed, permissions granted, so what? If, in the main, the participants are young, hormonal, naive, and perhaps a little star-struck, they could view these shows as their big chance to become \u201creality stars\u201d. (Note: only a few of them manage to do this, and most regret having on-screen sex.) Such young hopefuls are likely to feel pressured to have sex, not only by the TV people, but also by each other. And did I mention the copious amounts of free alcohol? Is this good television practice, or is it cynical manipulation and exploitation? You might say, who cares if a bunch of young, drunk idiots end up being embarrassed by on-screen footage? Well, I care. I generally go pretty low with television (I remember having a good cackle at Celebrity Love Island) \u2013 but not so low that I\u2019m not disturbed by the thought of young working-class people being coerced into having on-screen sex, usually for naff-all, not even the holy grail of a shortlived reality star career. I don\u2019t judge the participants, but perhaps the people behind these shows need to have a think. If you must make porn, make it honestly not gutlessly \u2013 pay participants properly and explain the long-term consequences. Above all, don\u2019t try to pass off potentially huge life-changing decisions as exciting light entertainment opportunities."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
