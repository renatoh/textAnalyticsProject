The world No1 was not at his best over the Easter weekend and almost suffered a quarter-final defeat at the hands of Chris Dobey before edging through 6-5. A routine 6-1 win over Gary Anderson\u2019s conqueror, Joe Cullen, followed to set up a final with Wright, who had beaten Michael Smith 6-4 in the last four at a sold-out BallhausForum. Van Gerwen was too strong for Wright in the UK Open final earlier in the season but it looked as though the Scotsman would gain revenge when storming into a 3-1 lead, helped along by a stunning 158 finish, in the best-of-11-legs contest. But the Dutchman, seeking his 10th European Tour title, eventually levelled the scores with an 85 finish in leg eight before edging ahead for the first time and, when Wright missed double 16 to force a deciding leg, MVG clinched the \u00a325,000 winner\u2019s cheque with a 70 finish."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
