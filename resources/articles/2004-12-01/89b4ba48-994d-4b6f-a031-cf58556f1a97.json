The captain's goals at the Stadio Olimpico gave him two more than the previous Roma record scorer Roberto Pruzzo but the Italy forward's achievement was soured slightly as it came on a day when he threatened in a newspaper interview to quit his club. The 28-year-old Totti says he will leave his only club to play abroad when his contract expires in 2006 unless Roma return to being title contenders. The 2001 Italian champions are in mid-table this season. Third-placed Udinese beat Lazio 3-0 yesterday to close the gap on the leaders. Lazio's coach Domenico Caso's position looks bleak after defeat left his team just a point off the relegation zone. Juventus go into Italy's winter break slightly fortunate to be still four points ahead of Milan after their summit meeting in Turin ended 0-0 on Saturday night. Milan had the better of the game with the European footballer of the year Andrei Shevchenko hitting a post early on and Andrea Pirlo wasting a fine chance a minute from time. Juve's coach Fabio Capello said: \"It wasn't down to one or two players being to blame, it was general. Milan are in very good shape and we aren't at the peak of our condition.\" Michael Owen scored with a header in a rare start for Real Madrid in Saturday's 3-2 comeback win at Racing Santander. Raul scored Real's second equaliser and Zinedine Zidane delivered the winner in injury-time. David Beckham was dropped because he had not \"trained well\", Real's coach Mariano Garcia Remon said yesterday. \"Roberto Carlos and Beckham haven't trained well and I felt they shouldn't play. I pick the team [based on] work during the week,\" the coach added. \"In addition, these two players have been carrying slight injuries.\" It was not clear how much Beckham's injury had contributed to training problems. Espanyol remained second behind their city rivals Barcelona with a 0-0 draw at Numancia after Barca needed a late, controversial penalty by Ronaldinho to draw 1-1 at home to Valencia ."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
