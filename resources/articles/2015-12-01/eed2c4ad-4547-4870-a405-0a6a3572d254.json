The S&amp;P 500 has followed an almost identical trajectory and closed up 1.45%. Neither Bernie Sanders nor the Guardian editorial board are sold on the rate change; we will doubtless be sussing out the effects of the hike for years go come. The blog is wrapping up for the afternoon but our full story on the meeting, the hike and the reaction from many different sectors is here. Keep coming back to the business section as the story unfolds. Dean Turner, an economist at UBS, said he believed the market impact would be largely positive, since what financial systems like least is equivocation and the last several months of will-they-or-won\u2019t-they has made investment difficult. \u201cMarkets should welcome the decision to hike US rates as it puts months of uncertainty to one side,\u201d he wrote. Turner, who also said UBS favored yield European bonds, said he thought further rate increases would not hurt economic growth domestically. \u201cWe expect the pace of tightening next year to be gradual, with four more hikes in 2016. Although this is more hawkish than the markets currently expect, we believe that the US economy will continue to expand.\u201d Turner also said the UK would likely follow suit. \u201cThe US interest rate rise is unlikely to influence the timing of the Bank of England\u2019s decision to hike rates,\u201d Turner said. \u201cHowever, it still looks as though the BoE will be the first central bank to follow the US, though the inflation and wage outlook over the next few months suggests they have time to wait. We currently expect the BoE to raise rates in May, followed by a further hike in November.\u201d Jana Kasperkevic, on the ground in DC, spoke to deputy labor secretary Chris Lu about part-time unemployment. There are few things that Yellen says the FED is still concerned about - one of them is the \u201cabnormal high level of part-time employment\u201d. Earlier this month, the US Department of Labor announced that \u201cthe number of persons employed part time for economic reasons\u201d - those who wanted a full time job and could not find one - \u201cincreased by 319,000 to 6.1 million in November, following declines in September and October.\u201d In an interview with the Guardian, the US Deputy Secretary of Labor Chris Lu dismissed that jump in part-time unemployed. \u201cWe don\u2019t focus too much on one month. This 319,000 is really significant drop from the month before. I don\u2019t have the number of what it went down by in October, but if you look at the long-term trend, going back to 2010, it has gone down significantly,\u201d Lu told the Guardian. The number of Americans employed part-time for economic reasons in October was about 5.76m. In September, that number was a little more than 6m. Lu is however, correct that the number has come down over the years. Just last year, in November 2014, the number of those working part-time jobs but wanting full time jobs was 6.85m. In 2012, that number was 8.1m. When asked if the November jump in part-time workers was significant, Elise Gould, senior economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute also said that the number was not a reason for alarm. \u201cThose numbers are jumpy,\u201d she told the Guardian. After clocking in an hour and seven minutes of press conference, Yellen ends her final comments with another assertion that the Fed will watch wages closely (along with inflation, unemployment, and every other economic measure) as it decides whether to hike interest rates again. Yellen wants Americans to think of the new interest rate as a vote of confidence in the economy. Democratic candidate for president Bernie Sanders thinks she\u2019s made a big mistake. \u201cWhen millions of Americans are working longer hours for lower wages, the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to raise interest rates is bad news for working families. At a time when real unemployment is nearly 10 percent and youth unemployment is off the charts, we need to do everything possible to create millions of good-paying jobs and raise the wages of the American people. \u201cThe Fed should act with the same sense of urgency to rebuild the disappearing middle class as it did to bail out Wall Street banks seven years ago.\u201d And not that the chairwoman asked, the Guardian\u2019s editorial board has also dubbed the increase \u201crisky and premature\u201d, due to the unusual pace of the economy after the recession. Yellen says the Fed isn\u2019t following a calendar for interest rates, but she says it like this: \u201cIt is not the intention of the commiIttee to follow any mechanical formula of that type.\u201d \u201cI see import prices and energy prices as holding down\u201d inflation, she says. We\u2019re coming towards the end of Yellen\u2019s press conference and so far the stock markets are loving it. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen pretty much constantly since she started talking. We\u2019ve come a long way considering that any talk of a rate hike used to send investors into a panic. Yellen again dodges a question about what happens if inflation doesn\u2019t do what the Fed wants it to (increase gradually on its way up to 2%). She alludes to the stock market shocks of international markets and the continuing plummet of energy prices. \u201cI do expect there is a bottom to that, I expect that we\u2019ll be seeing that.\u201d The Fed will keep an open mind about action to cope with inflation, she says, but again refuses to get into what the committee will look for as it judges the consequences of its own decisions. Long-term loans should not move much because of the decision, Yellen tells a reporter, urging the same calm as she has for nearly an hour. \u201cLoans that are linked to longer term interest rates are unlikely to move very much,\u201d she says, using \u201csome corporate loans\u201d as an example. \u201cSome credit card rates and short-term borrowing rates might move up slightly,\u201d she concedes. But \u201cremember,\u201d she says, \u201cwe\u2019ve made a very small move.\u201d Today\u2019s decision follows months of debate and dissent, my colleagues Jana Kasperkevic and Rupert Neate note \u2013 but today\u2019s decision was unanimous. In his analysis of the minutes from the October\u2019s meeting, Rupert observed: \u201c\u2019a couple\u2019 members raised concerns that raising rates in December could be premature.\u201d The first dissent this year came during the September meeting, when Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, broke ranks and voted to increase the interest rates. \u201cUS economic conditions have improved quite significantly over the last six years, all things considered. It\u2019s time to recognize the substantial progress that has been achieved and align rates accordingly,\u201d Lacker said at the time. \u201cI supported raising the target range for the federal-funds rate by 25 basis points at this meeting. Interest rates have been near zero for over six years. Even after a quarter-point increase, interest rates would remain exceptionally low, providing ample support for economic growth. \u201d Lacker\u2019s dissent broke a stretch of five straight unanimous votes \u2013 spanning back to January of this year. Interest rates are up from de facto zero, Yellen thinks the US economy is fit, and for the first time in seven years the Federal Reserve isn\u2019t working with record-low, pro-expansion rates. The key word in Fed\u2019s statement was \u201cgradual\u201d. Financial markets would have been spooked had it talked about a \u201cmeasured\u201d increase in interest rates, because that would have suggested a repetition of the last cycle of US monetary tightening between 2004 and 2006, when there were 17 separate quarter-point jumps in the cost of borrowing. The drip-drip approach that eventually killed off the housing boom and prompted the sub-prime mortgage crisis. Nobody expects a repeat of that, because much has changed since 2006. America\u2019s recovery has been weak by its own standards, the percentage of Americans working has fallen, and there is no real inflationary pressure. The \u201cnew normal\u201d for interest rates is around 2%, not the 5%-plus they reached before the great recession. Wall Street took the decision by the US central bank to raise the cost of borrowing in its stride, and no wonder. This has been one of the best flagged interest rate decisions in history and the emollient language used by the Fed was exactly what traders had been expecting. Manufacturing, the skewed employment participation rates, and other \u201cpressures\u201d do concern the fed, the chairwoman says, \u201cbut the underlying health of the US economy I consider to be quite sound.\u201d I think it\u2019s a myth that expansions die of old age, I do not think that they die of old age. So the fact that this has been quite a long expansion doesn\u2019t lead me to believe that it\u2019s days are numbered. But the economy does get hit by shocks and there are both positive shocks and negative shocks, so there is a significant odds that the economy will suffer some shock that we don\u2019t know about that will put it into recession. So yes there is some probability that that could happen and of course we would appropriately respond but it isn\u2019t something that is fated to happen because we\u2019ve had a long expansion. \u201cYes, we have tolerated inflation shortfalls that we thought would disappear,\u201d she says, without answering the question exactly of what the Fed would do if inflation continues to defy their expectations. She answers a similar question about contingency plans by saying the Fed is focused on medium and long-term projections. \u201cI\u2019m not going to give you a simple formula for what we want to see\u201d on inflation, Yellen says, dodging a question about the Fed\u2019s vaunted but still mysterious \u201cmedium term\u201d plan. So far the chairwoman has not described it in many terms aside from \u201ctransitory\u201d and \u201cgradual\u201d. Yellen says the \u201csomewhat abnormally high level of part-time employment\u201d is one of the markers that continues to concern her, and the Fed wants to watch what happens next with unemployment and inflation before taking action. She repeats that it was very important to her not to wait too long and be \u201cforced to tighten abruptly\u201d. That would risk \u201caborting what I would like to see as a very long-running and sustainable expansion\u201d, she says. \u201cWe recognize that inflation is well below our 2% goal,\u201d she says, but the committee has a theory for how inflation should behave. \u201cWe\u2019re reasonably close, not quite there, but reasonably close to our maximum employment objective, but we have a significant shortfall on inflation.\u201d The Fed will watch and wait, Yellen says, to see what this long awaited hike affects the markets. I think it\u2019s prudent to be able to watch what the impact is on financial conditions and spending in the economy, and moving in a timely fashion enables us to do this. She asks the press not to make too much of this first tentative nudge toward a normal policy. She I think it\u2019s important not to overblow the significance of this first move, it\u2019s only 25 basis points. Monetary poilcy remainds accomodative. \u2026 We will be watching very carefully what happens in the economy.\u201d Yellen shows a slide with the committee members\u2019 predictions \u2013 the dot plot. Yellen lays out the committee\u2019s forecasts, saying the Fed will respond according to the health of the economy. \u201cA stronger growth or a more rapid increase in inflation than we currently anticipate would suggest that the neutral funds rate is rising more quickly than expected,\u201d she says. \u201cIf the economy were to disappoint the federal funds rate would rise more slowly \u2026 The committee is confident that the normalization process will proceed smoothly.\u201d She says the committee is \u201cprepared to make adjustments to our tools\u201d if the market demands it. \u201cWe recognize that it takes time for monetary policy actions to affect future economic outcomes,\u201d Yellen continues. Were the Fed to wait \u201ctoo long, we would likely end up having to tighten policy relatively abruptly at some point to keep the economy from overheating and to keep inflation from [dramatically] overshooting our objective.\u201d She doesn\u2019t want to risk another recession, and says interest rates will likely change only very gradually. Yellen lays out median growth projections: 2.2% for GDP growth for this year, 2.4% for next year. The path of the median longer-run unemployment rate is slightly lower than the Fed had previously predicted, she adds. They expect inflation to remain very low for the near future, and expect it to reach 2% not until 2018. \u201cDevelopments abroad\u201d could still threaten the stability of the US economy, Yellen says, but nowhere near what they could have done this summer. The economy is strong enough to weather their fluctuations, she says. Yellen notes that low energy prices and the appreciation of the dollar have \u201cweighed on inflation\u201d and held down import prices. But \u201cas these transitory influences fade and as the labor market [increases] further, the committee\u201d believes inflation will reach 2%, she says. Yellen outlines the criteria that she believes the economy has met for making an interest rate increase feasible. Unemployment is down to 5%, she says, with some caveats. \u201cThat said, some cyclical weakness likely remains. The labor force participation rate is still below estimates \u2026 and wage growth has yet to show a sustained pickup.\u201d \u201cUS real gross domestic product is estimated to have increased at an average pace of 2.25%,\u201d she adds. \u201cThis weakness has been offset by solid expansion of domestic spending. Continued job gains and increases in real disposable income have [increased] household spending,\u201d and car purchases are strong even as new home construction is still slow. \u201cWith gradual adjustments,\u201d she continues, \u201ceconomic activity will continue to expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen.\u201d Janet Yellen begins her comments: \u201cThis action marks the end of an extraordinary 7 year period during which the federal funds rate was held near zero to support the recovery of the economy from the worst financial crisis and recession since the Great Depression.\u201d She says the economy \u201chas come a long way\u201d though it\u2019s not where she\u2019d quite like it yet. She says that normalization \u201cis likely to proceed gradually\u201d, and \u201cinflation continues to run below our longer run objective\u201d. Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen will speak about the decision to nudge interest rates up in approximately two minutes. You can watch here, or in the embedded video at the top of the blog. And the markets react with just that: a zig-zag of a reaction, followed by what\u2019s largely a return to pre-announcement levels. The Dow is up 99 points, Treasuries are down, and the Euro\u2019s back to where it was. The quickest of takes from financial journalists and investors, ahead of Janet Yellen\u2019s press conference to elaborate on the decision. The full statement from the board of the Federal Reserve on the historic increase in interest rates: Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in October suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace. Household spending and business fixed investment have been increasing at solid rates in recent months, and the housing sector has improved further; however, net exports have been soft. A range of recent labor market indicators, including ongoing job gains and declining unemployment, shows further improvement and confirms that underutilization of labor resources has diminished appreciably since early this year. Inflation has continued to run below the Committee\u2019s 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; some survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have edged down. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will continue to expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen. Overall, taking into account domestic and international developments, the Committee sees the risks to the outlook for both economic activity and the labor market as balanced. Inflation is expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely. The Committee judges that there has been considerable improvement in labor market conditions this year, and it is reasonably confident that inflation will rise, over the medium term, to its 2 percent objective. Given the economic outlook, and recognizing the time it takes for policy actions to affect future economic outcomes, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1/4 to 1/2 percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative after this increase, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way. This policy, by keeping the Committee\u2019s holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. Interest rates will increase by 0.25%, the Federal Reserve has announced, the first hike after seven years of record lows. The Fed\u2019s statement on the increase says the decision is based on the economy \u201cexpanding at a moderate pace\u201d, with spending and investment increasing at \u201csolid rates\u201d and an improved housing sector. The Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will continue to expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen. \u2026 Given the economic outlook, and recognizing the time it takes for policy actions to affect future economic outcomes, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1/4 to 1/2 percent. The statement says that the Fed expects inflation to rise to 2% \u201cover the medium term\u201d. From inside the Fed: \u201cChair is in the house. I saw her\u201d says one journalist. \u201cShe is wearing blue.\u201d What\u2019s going to happen in seven minutes, when the Fed announces its plans for the fate of the economy? A hike in interest rates, most likely, but nobody knows what Janet Yellen and her cohorts quite intend. HSBC and MarketWatch have taken a stab at prognostication. A small hike A dovish hike scenario would reinforce HSBC\u2019s view that the dollar will weaken against its G-10 rivals in 2016. HSBC was one of the first major currency dealers to sour on the greenback. Back in the spring, the team, led by chief strategist David Bloom, accurately called the dollar\u2019s peak (at least, so far). The base case forecast calls for the euro to strengthen to $1.20 by the end of 2016. A big hike If the Fed\u2019s statement doesn\u2019t adhere to the cautious profile that many have anticipated, the dollar would likely benefit from a \u201crisk off\u201d rally, leaving the Aussie, kiwi and many emerging-market currencies vulnerable \u2026 \u201cIn the end, a [dollar] rally may sow the seeds of its own destruction as it would make delivery of additional rate hikes increasingly unnecessary. Short-term, however, we would not fight the [dollar] rally,\u201d HSBC said. No hike is also possible, and it\u2019s most uncertain how markets would respond should Yellen delay hikes yet again. At the Fed, my colleague Jana Kasperkevic waits with the other journalists, one of whom laments Yellen\u2019s timing: \u201cChairwoman Yellen, why, why did you decide to raise the interest rates today? Today of all days, nine days before Christmas!\u201d As the clock ticks down to the Fed\u2019s big announcement, Janet Yellen and her fellows take over Twitter \u2026 \u2026 where financial journalists proceed to pore over her horoscope. And share interactive games of Federal Reserve interest hike bingo. Anyone wondering whether the Fed reallywill raise rates this time might want to look back at Yellen\u2019s comments the last time they went up, long ago in June 2006, business editor Dominic Rushe writes. Back then Yellen was president of the San Francisco Fed and argued against a raise \u2013before deciding to vote with her colleagues for an increase. \u201cIn general, I believe that we should do the right thing, even if it surprises markets, but in this case our public statements seem to have convinced the public that we will raise the funds rate today,\u201d she said then. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t follow through, there would likely be some loss of credibility for policy.\u201d Yellen and other Fed officials have pretty clearly signaled that a rise is coming this time If it doesn\u2019t she may damage her credibility \u2013 and cause panic in the markets. Fed watchers are responding to the (possibly) last minutes of the rock-bottom-interest-rates era with \u2026 mixed emotions. My colleague Jana Kasperkevic is in Washington to hear from the chairwoman herself \u2013 she\u2019s sent a photo from the bowels of DC. She says that a photographer and a sound tech are bantering about how cold the room is. \u201cYou sit in a meat locker where interest rates go to die,\u201d the photographer says, pausing for effect. \u201cWell, except today.\u201d This is your 60 minute warning! We have one hour to wait until a potentially historic rate rise (or serious market volatility if the Fed surprises us all) Here\u2019s a quick guide of what to watch out for when the Federal Reserve makes its decision. Does the Fed raise rates, and by how much? Borrowing costs are currently 0% to 0.25% - the market expects a 25 basis point rise, to 0.5%. But there is some chatter that the Fed could take a baby steps, and only raise the fund rate by 10 basis points. Was the Fed split? The rate-setting committee contains hawks and doves. In October, Jeffrey Lacker of Richmond split and voted for a hike. This time, it\u2019s possible that the dovish Chicago Fed President Charles Evans might refuse to support higher borrowing costs. The economic forecasts. Is the Fed more upbeat about growth and employment prospects? The dot plot. As explained earlier, each Fed policymaker will use dots to show where they think interest rates will be between today and 2018. Barclays\u2019 Michael Gapen predicts the plot will show four rate rises in 2016. Janet Yellen\u2019s tone. Today\u2019s press conference is a key moment in Yellen\u2019s career. Her guidance will be crucial in determining whether the Fed avoids spooking investors. Expect to see the word \u201cgradual\u201d pop up plenty of times. My US colleague Alan Yuhas will guide you through the next few hours... Michael Gapen, Barclays\u2019 chief US economist, says the Federal Reserve\u2019s goal today is to raise interest rates and avoid causing any market turmoil. Speaking on Bloomberg TV, Gapen says the Fed has a \u201cvery real and very tangible\u201d fear of spooking investors. The real trick today is to get off zero, but avoid a taper tantrum. (The taper tantrum occurred in June 2013, when global markets tumbled on fears that the Fed was about to slow its QE bond-buying programme) We\u2019re into the last 90 minutes before the Fed decision hits the wires.... Jack Welch, the legendary former boss of General Electric, believes the Fed should have bitten the bullet back in September. Speaking on CNBC today, Welch argued that rates should have been raised three months ago - before the rout in the commodity market got underway: \u201cIt would have been better to go last time actually. Conditions were better. The economy is not any stronger. The commodities have gone further down.\u201d Of course, if the Fed had hiked in September, we\u2019d have blamed them for the recent slump in oil prices which has rattled stock markets. Janet Yellen faces the media 30 minutes after the interest rate decision hits the wires (2.30pm in Washington, or 7.30pm for UK readers) That press conference will be as significant as the decision itself - as the Fed chair\u2019s comments will be microscopically examined by investors around the globe: Yellen will be probed about the likely path of interest rates, her view of the US economy, and also her assessment of global markets. In September, the Fed cited market jitteriness over China\u2019s slowing economy as a reason to leave rates unchanged. The Financial Times has pulled together a handy guide to the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision today: Here\u2019s a flavour: What is expected? The 10 officials setting US monetary policy are forecast to raise the range for the Fed funds rate \u2014 the interest banks charge each other overnight to lend reserves kept at the Fed \u2014 by a quarter percentage point from 0-0.25 per cent to 0.25-0.5 per cent. If they do raise, how will officials explain the move? Policymakers have been at pains to stress that their actions are dependent on the state of the economy, so expect them to point to the cumulative progress it has made since emerging from recession in 2009. The most recent bulletins from the labour market (211,000 jobs created in November) and inflation (a core measure hit 2 per cent last month) may have given officials the extra confidence they needed in order to move. What about the pace of rate rises? That the pace of increases is more important than the timing of the first one has arguably been the mantra of Fed officials this year. So should the rate be lifted, expect to hear more of that. More here: Fed rate decision: what to watch for After two thousand, five hundred and fifty six days of record low interest rates, dating back to December 2008, America has just two hours to wait until the Fed (possibly) ends the era of ultra-loose monetary policy. Over on Wall Street, the tension is building, ahead of the announcement at 2pm local time (7pm GMT) European stock markets have closed for the night, meaning equity traders in the City must now sit and wait for the Fed. Most markets closed higher, but there was a late and somewhat jittery selloff. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100: up 43 points at 6,061, +0.72% Germany\u2019s DAX: up 16 points at 10,466, + 0.16% French CAC: up 13 points at 4,627, +0.28% Tony Cross, market analyst at Trustnet Direct, says there could be dramatic moves tomorrow.... There may well be some marked volatility tomorrow morning too, depending on the tone that Janet Yellen adopts in the press conference and it\u2019s worth bearing in mind that this could take a couple of days to work itself through the system. As well as the interest rate decision, the Federal Reserve will also give us a pre-Christmas treat - its latest economic forecasts. And that means economists, analysts and journalists across the globe will be squinting at the latest \u201cdot plot\u201d; a chart showing where policymakers believe interest rates will be in the next few years. The dot plot is a crucial part of the Fed\u2019s message, partly because the last one showed that the Fed expects rates to rise faster than the markets. Tony Crescenzi of bond-trading giant Pimco told CNBC that: \u201cThe dots are positioned for three to four [rate rises], and the market is positioned for two to three. It may seem out of sync with the dovish hike view.\u201d Here\u2019s the last dot plot, from September: (Note the festive Christmas tree formation in 2018) The yield, or interest rate, on US two-year government debt has hit 1%, for the first time since May 2010. That\u2019s another sign that Wall Street is bracing for the Fed to start tightening monetary policy. Yields (which measure the rate of return on a bond) rise when prices fall, so rising yields mean traders are selling safe-haven US Treasuries. The early rally on Wall Street is petering out. The Dow Jones industrial average, which was up 100 points earlier, has just turned negative. That\u2019s partly due to the oil price. US crude is down 4% today, after new supply figures showed that stocks rose by 4.8m barrels last week. Analysts had expected a drop of 1.4 million barrels, so fears of an oil glut are hitting shares. I trust this tweet is useful to any readers in emerging markets, wondering how the Fed\u2019s decision will affect them: Joshua Mahony, market analyst at City spread-betting firm IG, also reckons shares could rally once Janet Yellen has spoken today: The commentary surrounding today\u2019s announcement will be hugely important as this sets out expectations for future hikes. With a notorious dove at the helm, it is highly likely that Yellen will avoid needlessly spooking the markets and instead focus on the fact rates will rise at a relatively gradual and leisurely pace. Brian Davidson of Capital Economics has nailed his trousers to the mast, and predicted that global stock markets will applaud a rate hike today. In a research note to clients, Davidson says: We think that a 25bp rise in the federal funds rate is likely to be seen as a vote of confidence in the US and world economy, and could boost global equity markets. He also produced this graph, showing how stock markets have typically rallied after a Fed hike - although Wall Street has usually lagged behind other developed markets (such as the City of London, and Tokyo). Davidson reckons the US stock market will \u2018edge higher\u2019 in 2016, with other developed markets (DMs) doing better: Not only do we expect multinationals in Japan and the euro-zone to receive a boost to their earnings via weaker currencies, but we think that there is more scope for corporate profit margins to rise in many DMs, given the stage of the business cycle in these countries. The wisdom of crowds... It may not be scientific (there were just 89 votes!) but it highlights that the markets are expecting the Fed\u2019s more hawkish members to carry the day. The foreign exchange markets are quiet today - but it could be the calm before the storm. The dollar is currently up against the British pound, but flat against the euro: Here\u2019s a handy way of decoding the Fed statement in a few hour\u2019s time: Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, remembers the last time the Fed started raising rates. (here\u2019s the Fed statement from June 2004) Three of the last four tightening cycles have seen the Federal Reserve hike rates steadily, as this chart from Credit Suisse shows: History probably won\u2019t repeat itself this time -- Fed chair Janet Yellen is likely to emphasise that future rate hikes will be gradual. Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis, has told Reuters he expects that a dovish performance from Janet Yellen today (the so-called \u2018dovish hike\u2019) \u201cI think the ideal outcome today is that the Fed raises rates and they give us a lot of verbiage that says we\u2019re going to go slow.\u201d \u201cYellen is a dove and she is going to remain a dove. She has to follow through and hammer home that they\u2019re not going to be in a hurry and that\u2019s what the market wants.\u201d The Wall Street opening bell is being rung, and trading is underway in New York. It could be a historic session - the day that the Federal Reserve begins the long process of normalising monetary policy. And right now, investors are facing that prospect in good heart. The Dow Jones industrial average has jumped by 0.9% in early trading, gaining 164 points to 17,689. The S&amp;P 500 (a broader measure of the stock market) is up 0.6%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is up 0.9%. Here\u2019s the Federal Reserve\u2019s HQ in Washington today, where policymakers are pondering whether to end seven years of record low borrowing costs: Three months ago, there was genuine uncertainly over whether the Fed would raise interest rates or not (in the end they didn\u2019t, of course). But today\u2019s decision is a no-brainer, at least according to Kully Samra, a managing director at investment manager Charles Schwab, who says: \u201cIt is a foregone conclusion that the Fed is going to raise rates.\u201d (The latest pricing from the financial markets suggests there s a 78% chance of a rate hike tonight) Just five hours to go.... One thing is certain. Whatever the Fed say today will be a lot less alarming than the statement they issued on December 17 2008 as the biggest financial crisis in generations swirled. By delicious timing, today is the seventh anniversary of the historic rate cut that brought the Fed fund rate down to almost zero. And here\u2019s how they announced it: Hat-tip to Bloomberg\u2019s Lorcan Roche Kelly for this info: The Jubilee Debt Campaign, the anti-poverty charity, has warned that a US interest rate rise would bring new pain to world\u2019s poorest countries. Their director, Sarah-Jayne Clifton, says: \u201cMany developing countries are already suffering from a fall in prices of their commodity exports. An increase in US interest rates will compound this further, further weakening exchange rates and increasing debt payments. It\u2019s already been a tough year for emerging market currencies. The Malasian Ringgit, for example, has shed almost a quarter of its value against the US dollar since January. Brazil\u2019s Real has tumbled by over 40%. There are several reasons why the Fed should raise interest rates today, and just as many reasons for caution. The \u201chike now\u201d brigade can point to the jobless rate. At just 5%, it is close to the measure of \u2018full employment\u2019 where wages could soon spike (although today\u2019s UK employment report, showing record employment and lower wage growth, rather undermines that theory!) Inflation is picking up (although at just 0.5% it\u2019s hardly red-hot). And there\u2019s the argument that a modest rate rise now reduces the danger that Janet Yellen has to aggressively hike in the future. But this is not an easy call. The Federal Reserve needs to consider the impact on the world economy. Huge amounts of capital flowed into emerging markets in recent years, and is now heading back to the US - destabilising developing economies and weakening their currencies. That could have a knock-in effect on the US economy, especially if a stronger dollar makes exports less attractive overseas. And while the US labour market looks solid at first glance, wage growth is still modest. And the proportion of people who have dropped out of the labour market is the highest since 1977. Ultimately, the Fed may conclude that raising rates today is simply less disruptive than shocking the markets by leaving them on hold. This chart from the Economist (printed before yesterday\u2019s inflation data showed CPI had risen from 0.2% to 0.5%), outlines the issues in more detail: Raising interest rates is not quite as simple a process as you might expect, especially if you\u2019re starting from zero. The FT\u2019s Robin Wigglesworth has examined the process here, and explained why it might be bumpy. How the US Federal Reserve intends to raise rates As Robin explains, the Fed\u2019s traditional weapon is its \u201cfunds rate\u201d, which has been stuck at between zero and 0.25 per cent for exactly seven years. This rate determines how much commercial banks are paid to leave funds at the Fed\u2019s vaults. By keeping it so low for so long, the Fed has been trying to encourage banks to put their money to work elsewhere. Most economists believe that the Fed will raise the funds rate to 0.5% at today\u2019s meeting. That should ripple out across the market, as banks won\u2019t be prepared to lend to anyone for less than they could get from the Fed. But in practice, many lenders cannot access the Fed\u2019s fund rate directly, And with so much money swirling in the system, So the Fed might use a different weapon to push borrowing costs up. Over to Robin.... Acting as a floor for now at 0.05 per cent, the overnight reverse repo programme, or Overnight RRP, is primarily aimed at money market funds, and is expected to do much of the heavy lifting. In a typical RRP the Fed\u2019s market desk sells a Treasury bond from its portfolio to a money-market fund and agrees to buy it back the next day at a certain price, a process known as \u201crepo\u201d, short for repurchase. In practice, the central bank\u2019s balance sheet does not shrink, but this sets a benchmark for cash interest rates paid by the Fed itself. These RRP operations will happen every business day between 12.45pm and 1.15pm in New York. The Fed might need to boost its RRP activities considerably, in order to transmit higher borrowing costs into the market. And that means that the process might not be as smooth as one might like.... The New York stock market is expected to follow Europe\u2019s lead, when trading begins in two hours time. The futures market suggests the Dow Jones industrial average will jump by 104 points, or 0.6%, when Wall Street opens. CNBC points out that it\u2019s eleven and a half-years since the Federal Reserve began its last \u2018tightening cycle\u2019 (starting the process of raising interest rates) in summer 2004. That last cycle lasted two years, and was ended by the credit crunch in 2007. The next cycle is likely to move slowly, with the Fed possibly only raising interest rates twice next year.... In seven hours time, three Wall Street economists will either feel a bit daft or incredibly astute..... European stock markets are now rallying as investors anticipate that the long period of record low US interest rates will end tonight. There are still more than seven and a half hours until the Federal Reserve announces its decision. As covered in the introduction, the Fed will probably hike rates from the current low of 0% to 0.25%, ending seven years of historically easy money. Alastair McCaig of IG says a rate hike is widely expected: Fed Chair Janet Yellen has already told Santa what she wants as an early Christmas present and only time will tell if she has been good enough to get it. Over 95% of institutional analysts are calling for a 25 basis point increase and futures markets are factoring in an 80% chance that is what we will see. And that certainty is pushing shares higher. It follows a strong session in Asia, where the Japanese and Australian markets both gained more than 2%. There\u2019s also plenty of speculation that we\u2019ll get a \u2018dovish hike\u2019; Janet Yellen may emphasise that rates will still rise slowly, and only if the data justifies it. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 of top blue-chip shares is leading the rally risen by 48 points to 6066, a gain of 0.8%. European markets are being boosted by this morning\u2019s PMI surveys from Markit. They show that the eurozone\u2019s private sector has posted its strongest quarter in four and a half-years. The drop in wage growth is a reminder that many families will enter 2016 in a worrying financial position. My colleague Heather Stewart writes: Wage growth across the economy has slowed to 2%, underlining the financial challenges facing households in the run-up to Christmas. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that average wages grew at an annual rate of 2% in the three months to October. That marked a significant weakening from the 2.4% growth seen in the previous three-monthly period. With inflation running at just 0.1%, living standards are still rising, on average. But anaemic pay growth undermines hopes that household balance sheets will continue to improve after the long post-recession squeeze that saw pay flat or falling for several years. Once bonuses were included, pay growth in the three months to October was still just 2.4%, down from 3% over July to September, the ONS said. Here\u2019s her story on today\u2019s unemployment report: Britain\u2019s bosses argue that they need to achieve higher productivity in order to fund pay rises. Michael Martins, economic analyst at the Institute of Directors, says the UK labour market looks in good shape: \u201cYet again, these latest jobs figures make for welcome reading. The facts are impressive, and, given the turbulence which is affecting many parts of the world, worth repeating. In nearly every aspect, the labour market is tightening. The employment rate is at its highest ever level, the unemployment rate is down to its lowest since well before the crash at 5.2%, and youth unemployment \u2013 always a tricky problem to solve \u2013 continues to fall impressively. All of this indicates we are closing in on full employment. But on wages, Martins points out that productivity increases have not matched this year\u2019s pay rises. He also suggests that the sight of inflation turning negative this year may have undermined the case for bumper pay claims. \u201cFirms may be taking advantage of the low-inflation era to offer smaller nominal increases in salaries while employees who have benefitted from cheaper food and fuel prices may not be demanding as much. Since so many jobs are still being created, and young and long-term unemployed people are moving back in to work, these new jobs may simply pay less, dragging down the average figures. Classic economics teaching would suggest that wage growth should be accelerating as the unemployment rate drops (as firms are forced to stump up more to attract staff). As Dr John Philpott, director of The Jobs Economist, points out, this isn\u2019t happening right now: There is a palpable sense of \u201cp\u00e0yj\u00e9 vu\u201d in the labour market, a reminder of the initial phase of the economic recovery characterized by a jobs boom alongside weak productivity and pay growth. What\u2019s most surprising it that for all the talk of mounting skills shortages employers appear perfectly capable of hiring at will without having to hike pay rates. The pound is falling against the US dollar, losing half a cent to $1.4992. Traders are calculating that the weak pay growth means there\u2019s even less chance that UK interest rates will rise soon. Bank of England policymakers have repeatedly said they want to see solid wage growth before hiking borrowing costs. So the sharp drop in average pay rises, to 2%, gives them another reason to sit tight. Today\u2019s report shows that Britain\u2019s bosses tightened the purse-strings in October. Regular pay, excluding bonuses, rose by just 1.7% during that month. That dragged pay growth during the August-October quarter down to 2% from 2.5%. Even when bonuses are included, total pay dropped to 1.9% in October - much lower than the 3% recorded in July-September. Here\u2019s the top line analysis of today\u2019s unemployment report, from the Office for National Statistics. It shows that employment levels in Britain hit record highs, joblessness fall again, but wage growth went off the boil: There were 31.30 million people in work, 207,000 more than for May to July 2015 and 505,000 more than for a year earlier. There were 22.88 million people working full-time, 338,000 more than for a year earlier. There were 8.42 million people working part-time, 167,000 more than for a year earlier. The employment rate (the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 who were in work) was 73.9%, the highest since comparable records began in 1971. There were 1.71 million unemployed people (people not in work but seeking and available to work), 110,000 fewer than for May to July 2015 and 244,000 fewer than for a year earlier. There were 939,000 unemployed men, 153,000 fewer than for a year earlier. There were 774,000 unemployed women, 91,000 fewer than for a year earlier. The unemployment rate was 5.2%, lower than for a year earlier (6.0%). It has not been lower since the 3 months to January 2006. The unemployment rate is the proportion of the labour force (those in work plus those unemployed) that were unemployed. There were 8.93 million people aged from 16 to 64 who were economically inactive (not working and not seeking or available to work), 63,000 fewer than for May to July 2015 and 126,000 fewer than for a year earlier. The inactivity rate (the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 who were economically inactive) was 21.9%, lower than for a year earlier (22.3%). The inactivity rate has not been lower since October to December 1990. Comparing August to October 2015 with a year earlier, pay for employees in Great Britain increased by 2.4% including bonuses and by 2.0% excluding bonuses. Pay rises may be falling because employers have noticed that inflation has been hovering around zero all year. The UK consumer prices index is currently 0.1%, meaning pay rises are not being eaten up by inflation. But real wage increases of 2% are still modest in historical terms, especially when you remember that workers suffered falling real wages for several years after the financial crisis began. This chart shows how UK pay growth slowed sharply last quarter: The latest UK unemployment report is out, and it shows a sharp, and worrying, slowdown in pay growth. The good news is that the unemployment rate has fallen to 5.2%, which is the lowest level since 2008 - the start of the financial crisis. It hasn\u2019t been lower since January 2006. And the employment rate has risen to 73.9%, the highest since comparable records began in 1971. BUT wage growth has slowed alarmingly. Average earnings, excluding bonuses, increased by just 2% annually in the three months to October. That\u2019s sharply down on the 2.4% recorded in the three months to September, and is the slowest rate since early 2015. Pay including bonuses rose by 2.4% during the quarter, down from 3% in the three months to September. It suggests that the welcome boost in real earnings earlier this year may already be petering out.... More to follow.... Investors should avoid going anywhere too exotic over Christmas, as the Federal Reserve could provoke fresh upheaval in the markets. That\u2019s according to Peter Rosenstreich, head of market strategy at Swissquote Bank. He says that today\u2019s \u201chighly anticipated and overly hyped FOMC December meeting\u201d will probably spark significant volatility -- many younger traders on Wall Street haven\u2019t experienced a rate hike before, after all. We are unconvinced that global markets will stabilize after the FOMC decision, so traders should keep their vacations local. Rosenstreich also predicts that higher borrowing costs will force more junk bonds into default: There have been worrying swings in high yield credit spreads (and Third Avenue\u2019s collapse) indicting the debt market\u2019s anxiety with adapting to the new tightening era. As pointed out by the Financial Times today the $1.3tn junk bond markets has relied heavily on endless cheap money. While so far only the energy sectors have been truly effected we suspect that defaults will quickly spread as the cost of funding swiftly rises.\u201d (Third Avenue announced last week it was shutting its Focused Credit Fund, which invested in high-yield (and thus riskier) assets) Tension is rising in the City, even though there\u2019s AGES until the Fed delivers its decision (at 7pm GMT or 2pm East Coast time) Kit Juckes, top currency strategist at French bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale is Fed up (geddit?!) after months of speculation about today\u2019s central bank meeting, and the twists and turns in the foreign exchange market. At this point, my brain\u2019s scrambled. Yesterday was all about positions being taken off, but did I know that would mean option expiries taking EUR/USD sharply lower in the afternoon? No I did not... We\u2019ve waited so long for this policy move that the initial reaction may be meaningless. Beyond the very short term however, the US economy will go on growing, the Fed will hike further, and the dollar will rally through 2016. A cautious start to trading in Europe has seen some stock markets dip into the red: After strong rallies yesterday, investors may be getting a dose of pre-Fed jitters: Conner Campbell of SpreadEx explains: It\u2019s finally here! December\u2019s Fed Wednesday is upon us and with it the likely end to the year-long uncertainty over when exactly the central bank is going to raise interest rates. Yet with nothing certain until the big reveal this evening the markets are looking pretty jittery, the European open suffering a case of pre-game nerves after yesterday\u2019s aggressive rebound. It is exactly seven years since the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to their current record lows of between zero and 0.25%. That historic decision was taken in December 2008 -- a few weeks after Barack Obama won the US presidential election. At the time, few people thought rates would stay so low for so long. Indeed, Ben Bernanke has admitted as much. The former Fed chair told Marketwatch that policymakers expected the economy would grow faster: We were over-optimistic about the pace of growth in large part because we didn\u2019t anticipate the slowdown in productivity growth that we\u2019ve seen. However, from a cyclical perspective, the economy has recovered in fact more quickly than we anticipated in that the unemployment rate has fallen more quickly than we thought it would, indicating that we have moved back towards something approaching full employment. Over the last three years, the unemployment rate has fallen about 3 percentage points which is relatively rapid, so, in that respect, the economy has actually done a little better than we have anticipated but in terms of overall growth it\u2019s been less good. Germany has outperformed France (again). The German private sector is growing at a healthy rate this month, with the \u2018composite PMI\u2019 coming in at 54.9, close to November\u2019s 55.2. The first economic data of the day is disappointing. France\u2019s private sector has slowed to near-stagnation this month, with service sector firms reporting a slump in new business following November\u2019s terrorist attacks. Data firm Markit\u2019s composite output index, which tracks thousands of French firms, fell to 50.3 in December from 51.0 in November. That\u2019s worryingly close to the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction. Although manufacturing firms reported faster growth, service sector providers experienced the slowest rise in new work since August.\uf0a7 Jack Kennedy, senior economist at Markit, explains: \u201cFrench private sector output growth nearly ground to a halt at the end of 2015 amid faltering new business intakes. A slowdown in the dominant service sector was the driver, with some panellists indicating that their new business intakes had been impacted following the recent terrorist attacks. Shares in hotel groups and airlines fell in the aftermath of the Paris atrocities, as analysts warned that tourism would suffer. France\u2019s economy expanded by just 0.3% in the last quarter, not enough to lower its record unemployment rate. This PMI report suggests that growth may be slowing... My US colleague Jana Kasperkevic has pulled together a guide to today\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting: There are no early dramas in the European sovereign debt markets. Government bonds are changing hands at similar prices to last night, suggesting we\u2019re in a holding pattern ahead of the Fed: Some analysts, such as London Capital Market\u2019s Ipek Ozkardeskaya, just want the whole thing to be over: Central bank decision rooms are rarely places of peace and tranquility (as regular observers of the European Central Bank know well!). And the members of the Federal Reserve\u2019s Open Market Committee (FOMC) are unlikely to be united at today\u2019s meeting. Michael Hewson of CMC Markets reckons as many as three policymakers could oppose a 25 basis point hike in rates today: Given the Fed\u2019s ability to surprise and the current uncertain environment does it seem likely that the Fed will do as the market expects, or could we see a seriously split vote of at least three dissenters, with Evans, Brainard and Tarullo the most likely candidates? We need to consider the divergent nature of views aired in recent weeks which are bound to come into play and there is also the remote possibility that we could see a fudge that pleases nobody, and catches the market by surprise. Hewson also suggests that the Fed could surprise investors: A surprise could take the form of a band hike of 12.5 basis points, as opposed to 25, or the removal of the lower bound to a fixed rate of 0.25%. Moving the rate by 12.5 basis points wouldn\u2019t be an unusual state of affairs given that this was done on a periodic basis in the 1980\u2019s, but it would fly in the face of market expectations, and would certainly be a case of back to the future. Over in Asia, shares have bounced overnight as investors digested the prospect of a US interest rate hike tonight. In Tokyo, the Nikkei reversed two days of losses to close 2.6% higher. And Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200 bounced back from a three-year low, gaining 2.4%. The rally suggests that traders are pleased that the seemingly endless speculation over a Fed rate hike will probably end today. As Angus Nicholson of IG put it: The rally we are seeing in equity markets indicates that they are likely to respond well to a rate hike at the decision today as certainty in the direction of Fed policy should bring some stability to markets. City investors are approaching Fed Day in a cautious mood. The FTSE 100 is expected to inch up by around 5 points when trading begins, having surged by 143 points, or 2.45%, yesterday. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The waiting is nearly over. In just under 12 hours time, America\u2019s central bank will announce whether it has taken the plunge and raised interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. Today\u2019s Federal Reserve decision is the last major financial event of the year, and it really is a case of \u201call eyes on the Fed\u201d. A lot has happened since Ben Bernanke hiked interest rates in June 2006, to 5.25% \u2013 which may seem stratospheric to younger readers. A year later the credit crunch struck, followed by the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the global recession, and unprecedented stimulus packages from the world\u2019s central bankers which left US interest rates at just 0%-0.25%. Investors are widely expecting the Fed to start tightening monetary policy today. But if that happens, Fed chair Janet Yellen will probably take a dovish tone when she addresses the media at a press conference. Yellen is likely to emphasise that future rate moves will remain \u201cdata-dependent\u201d, meaning borrowing costs will stay low for some time. But will that be enough to prevent fresh turmoil in the foreign exchange, equities and commodity markets? The start of the Fed tightening cycle will surely cause some ructions in the markets in the weeks ahead. Anticipation of a hike has already driven emerging market currencies down and driven junk bonds into dangerous territory. But there will surely also be some relief that the waiting is finally over. This saga has gone on long enough..... What else is afoot? The Fed decision really is the main event today. But we can while away the time with new surveys of the eurozone economy, the latest UK unemployment data, and a second estimate of euro inflation. 8am-9am GMT: Manufacturing and service reports from Germany, France and the eurozone 9.30am: UK unemployment for November 10am: Final estimate of eurozone inflation for November 7pm: Federal Reserve decision 7.30pm: Janet Yellen\u2019s press conference"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
