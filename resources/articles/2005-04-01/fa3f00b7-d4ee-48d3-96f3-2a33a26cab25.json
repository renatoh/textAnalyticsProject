Through his paintings such as The Last Supper, or the luminous beauty of Mona Lisa, his flights of fantasy that created the models for discernible modern-day inventions such as the helicopter and the hang-glider, his sketches and ponderings on a vast range of subjects and his sheer inventiveness, da Vinci the man has become an enigma. And with each biographical effort to understand him, that enigma has become more, not less, obscure. His motivation is chalked up simply to such vague notions as inspiration or genius. It is admirable then, that Charles Nicholl should choose not only to consider da Vinci's great achievements in his wonderfully constructed biography, but also go some way to constructing an enthralling image of the real man behind them. The book is richly illustrated with da Vinci's work showing, through Nicholl's often forensic attention to detail, glimpses of his mind in action. Nicholl's portrait also deftly builds the man in full from the fragments he discovers in the often overlooked margins of his notes and manuscripts as well as the tax returns and contemporary writings. As a result of this labour of love, Charles Nicholl's book is a paean to its subject and a sort of Leonardian endeavour in its own right: ever-curious, intelligent, wide-ranging. We get the riddles that so delighted Leonardo set against Nicholl's biographer as detective. What emerges is so thorough and so gripping an account of a man that Leonardo at once becomes truly human while his achievements appear all the greater for that fact. If you read one book with da Vinci in its title this year, make it this one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
