Centuries before something similar surfaced in Scotland the Dutch were playing \"kolf\", or \"kolven\", a game involving knocking a ball at a target with an implement in shape curiously like a modern golf club. Given that there were strong trade links between the countries the transfer of the Dutch pastime seems almost a certainty - until you examine the evidence of the present day. Today's argument runs along the lines of: \"If it was the Dutch that started golf, how come they can't play it now and, what's more, never have been able to play it? How many majors have they won, how many Ryder Cup players have they produced?\" The answers to the last two questions are, of course, nil and nil, which is something that Maarten Lafeber intends to rectify. The 27-year-old is the surprise leader, after 36 holes, of the Lanc\u00f4me Trophy at St Nom la Bret\u00eache, his 12-under-par 130 being two shots better than Alex Cejka. Lafeber was born in Eindhoven but the attraction of golf escaped him until the age of 16, which is practically middle-aged in today's terms and some 15 years and nine months after Tiger Woods allegedly first swung a club. But he was a quick developer, won the Dutch, Spanish and Swiss amateur championships and, on turning professional, won the Kenya Open in 1999. Yesterday he had a second successive 65, a round that featured only one long putt, a 25-footer at the short 3rd, and one-holed bunker shot for a birdie at the short 18th. Afterwards he said: \"It is the dream of every tour player to play in the Ryder Cup.\" Asked if he believed his country was responsible for golf, he smiled and said: \"Of course. It is in history, isn't it?\" That, of course, depends on which nation's history books you read. This week Sam Torrance was asked if he had recovered from the rigours of celebrating Europe's Ryder Cup win, and he said: \"You've got to stop first before you can recover.\" But not so much a seasoned professional as a boiled, baked and basted one, the Scot knows when its time to go to work, and yesterday's 68 ensured that he made the cut with his two-under total. He made birdie at three of his last four holes and afterwards said: \"Hey, a bit of weekend work,\" and added, in his best Glasgie accent, \"Ye cannae keep a guid yin doon.\" \"I've not hit a ball for a month. I've been a wee bit busy.\" Torrance will play the next two European Tour events, in Madrid and Italy, and then play in the Warburg Cup, a made-for-TV extravaganza for seniors in which he will face Curtis Strange, the US Ryder Cup captain. \"I won't mind losing to him this time,\" said Torrance with a grin. Torrance's Ryder Cup captaincy is done with: that of Nick Faldo, if Faldo is to be believed, is to come. First, though, he wants to play in the 2004 team and on Thursday he putted his way to a 65. Yesterday produced a sharp reminder that, at the age of 45, consistency can be elusive. He had four bogeys in his outward half and his eventual total of 74 contained a vicious shank at the 9th, his 18th. Using a wedge but playing from a down slope and with the ball below his feet, Faldo's ball finished fully 40 yards to the right of the green. From there he had no shot and it led to another dropped stroke."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
