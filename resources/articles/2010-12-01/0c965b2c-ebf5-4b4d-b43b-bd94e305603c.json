This concert is part of Little's big mission to target the download generation \u2013 recordings are available free on her website \u2013 and get music out there to people. That she's clearly preaching to the converted here fazes her not at all. Little, playing a 1757 Guadagnini, chosen for its range of colours, fires off some volleys of Telemann by way of opening gambit, and then explains the elements of prestidigitation composer Paul Patterson has included in his Luslawice Variations, almost wistful early on, positively fiery by the end. But it is with Bach's Sonata for solo violin No 1 in G minor, where Little makes the lines speak with warmth and great clarity, that she communicates with the greatest immediacy. The balance of words to music weighs too strongly in favour of the former, yet Little is genuine and engaging, particularly when making connections with Yehudi Menuhin, a prime influence. In the Melodia from Bart\u00f3k's Sonata for solo violin, which Menuhin premiered, her sound is captivating. Similarly, the Ballade from Ysa\u00ffe's Sonata in D minor Op 27 is an ideal vehicle for displaying virtuosity and expressive tone. Mission accomplished, it would seem, but Little's encore, an arrangement of Danny Boy, proves too slight and the spell is broken."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
