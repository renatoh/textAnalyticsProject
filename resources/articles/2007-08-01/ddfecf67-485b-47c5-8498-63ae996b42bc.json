Perry, six kilograms lighter after being warned by Ashton in South Africa \"about his body shape\", now heads the queue of scrum-half candidates after being made man-of-the match. Easter's tries, not one of them from more than a yard, put him head-to-head with Lawrence Dallaglio for one of the back-row places among the final 30 names the head coach will announce on August 14: a former captain with 77 caps and three times a British Lion versus a journeyman who plied his trade at the South African club Villagers, Orrell and Rotherham and won his first cap last February. Dallaglio understands the competition. \"Having seen Nick raise the bar high, it was my job to raise the bar higher. I watched Nick score four tries and it went through my mind that I'd better do something,\" said Dallaglio, who left the replacements' bench in the 58th minute to score a try of his own and then make the one that enabled Perry to be so generous. \"I wasn't bothered in the slightest that Nick did so well, just pleased to see England produce such a performance.\" Dallaglio, 35 on Friday, hopes to celebrate by being in the starting line-up at Twickenham the following day when England play France. He says he had no doubts that the knee operation he had immediately after Wasps' Heineken cup victory in May would leave him unfit for the warm-up games. \"I don't do doubt,\" said Dallaglio. \"Now I want to start next week against France and go out and play better than Nick did today.\" If it is Easter's time to start on the bench the Harlequin hopes Dallaglio will return the favour he feels he did on Saturday. In the 58th minute the two No8s met mid-pitch and touched knuckles. \"I told him I'd softened them up and to just go and do his stuff,\" said Easter not trying to hide his amusement. He celebrates a birthday - his 29th - the day after the naming of the final 30 and hopes it will be with the biggest party possible for a man making his World Cup debut less than a month later. On Saturday he gave the firmest of hints that England are already clear in their plan of campaign. \"For the past week . . . to be honest, in fact, for the past six weeks, we've practised this pick-and-go style [we used today],\" said Easter, suggesting England could follow New Zealand and South Africa in driving through the heart of defences, rather than go round the outside. \"The backs laughed saying we would never score tries from 22 yards out that way but in the past when we have got under the posts we have tended to chuck it wide and that has led to turn-overs.\" Easter believes that the genesis of what Ashton called an \"outstanding\" forward display came from being beaten by Wales during the Six Nations. \"We were bullied in Cardiff and that was used as motivation,\" said Easter. \"We had to win but we also needed a performance. We've got a talented backline and some big forwards and we went back to some traditional attritional play which England have always been renowned for and which maybe we've gone away from in recent years.\" Unsurprisingly Ashton saw it differently. The coach, who has clearly run out of time for anything more visionary, described what his team did with something like 70% of the possession, as a balanced performance. \"We did not just play a tight game. We showed a bit of balance. We drove the ball well, we ran the ball well in the first half and our kicking game came into play with the last two tries,\" said Ashton. \"That last try [scored by Mathew Tait after Jonny Wilkinson spotted Wales had no full-back in place] was one of the most intelligent pieces of kicking rugby I have seen from England in a long time.\" Dallaglio v Easter Dallaglio Age 34 Caps 77 England debut November 1995 Clubs Wasps Honours World Cup winner (2003), captained England from 1997 to 1999.
