At the time of filing, the vote count is grinding on, and my purpose is not to get into winners and losers and the consequences. Here, I want to step back and look at some propositions that are uncomfortable for a person in my position to look at. Full disclosure. There are questions I ask myself constantly as a long-term political reporter. Some of these questions are easy. The daily one: am I telling the truth? The semi-regular one: do I have Stockholm syndrome? The hardest one: am I part of an apparatus that is making things worse? It\u2019s the last question I want to focus on this weekend, the existential one, because the moment renders this question paramount. Donald Trump has accelerated the drift towards post-truth, and the media is shackled to that acceleration. The post-truth festival reached a desperate zenith on Friday when Trump entered the White House press briefing room, and began lying copiously. The purpose of the lies, apart from graceless pique, was incitement. Trump wanted to rile his supporters. He wanted hackles raised. If Joe Biden wins, Trump wants to bequeath his political opponent a poison pill: a polity where resentments are so acute the country becomes ungovernable. Faced with this reality \u2013 a lying, dangerous demagogue openly hostile to political conventions and democratic norms \u2013 media outlets face difficult choices. Do networks refuse to broadcast the lies? Do media outlets disrupt the tirades with live fact-checking? Broadcast the news (and a president speaking meets the news test) without interruption, but put straps at the bottom of the screen alerting viewers to the fact a politician is making false claims? Broadcast minus the filter, leaving viewers to form their own conclusions? Puncturing self-serving propaganda with facts is the primary duty of journalists who take their professional responsibilities seriously and Trump\u2019s egregious falsehoods have triggered a rolling debate in my profession about the gossamer thin line between reporting and enabling. Call this rolling seminar atonement for the media\u2019s role in facilitating Trump\u2019s rise by treating the insurgent as a laugh track rather than the danger to democracy he actually was. But the problem with the seminar is there are no easy or even right answers to the questions we\u2019ve been asking ourselves. Consider Friday\u2019s Trump tirade as a case in point. Trump was trying to make a case that there is a conspiracy against him. Fake votes. Fake polls. Fake news outlets pretending the fake votes aren\u2019t fake. Obviously this is a florid fantasy, but Trump is speaking to supporters, American citizens, who also hold these views. He\u2019s validating voter predispositions, not inventing them. Biden looks likely to win this contest, but not by a landslide. Millions of Americans have stuck loyally with Trump, turning out in record numbers in 2020, in large part because they feel alienated from the institutions Trump constantly attacks. If we agree verifiable facts are important, that is a fact we can\u2019t overlook. So with that important context in mind, decisions about live fact-checking or censoring Trump\u2019s corrosive monologues carry higher stakes. The decision becomes about more than what is true and what is false. Broadcasters also have to consider how that most fundamental expression of our professionalism sits with people who suspect the media is conspiring actively to tear down the brave politician who, in their eyes, speaks truth. Journalists believe that speaking truth to power sits at the foundation of what we do. That\u2019s our value add. But in a time where polarisation is so pervasive, we also need to consider whether our longstanding professional objective feels persuasive to people who believe everything is broken, and the media \u2013 the personification of winner-takes-all smug elites \u2013 is one of the principal reasons why it\u2019s broken. The simplest way to express the perilous crossroads my profession stands at is this: truth is all we have, but truth is not enough. Having been honest about that, about the power of truth and its limits, we can now delve a little deeper. Part of the reason why our once shared societal realities feel fractured \u2013 why truth feels increasingly informed by where you stand as well as what you see \u2013 is because the mass media has stepped away from helping to shape those shared realities. Curating the commons was one of our roles during the golden age of journalism, but that \u201cvoice of God\u201d era was already waning precipitously by the time I arrived as a reporter 20 years ago. The reasons for this are complex. It would be a stupendously twee bit of reductionism for me to say the change has been driven entirely by commercial factors \u2013 that would miss the cultural revolution triggered by technological change \u2013 but the economics of our industry are part of the picture. We can step the commercial drivers out simply. The internet ate our revenue. Since that happened, media outlets have had to chase paying audiences. Emotions drive engagement and subscriber/supporter loyalty, and opinion is cheaper than news gathering. These underlying conditions incentivise media outlets to be sources of confirmation bias rather than pluralistic places where the resting views and dispositions of audiences will be challenged. The inexorable economics of the business is pushing media outlets to become preachers rather than persuaders, and this is part of the reason why democratic societies \u2013 America being the most critical case in point \u2013 are becoming ungovernable. Bear in mind too that contemporary media outlets are also under constant pressure to shrug off their alleged golden age/gatekeeper arrogance and listen more to their increasingly self-selecting audiences \u2013 cries that become louder when journalists present to the world as self-important, or brittle in the face of criticism. Preaching replacing fact-based persuasion is highly problematic for free societies, because there is no progress without persuasion, and there is no progress without active listening followed by compromise. Now this isn\u2019t me saying \u201cwoe is me\u201d, or \u201cmedia outlets do unhelpful things because *reasons* and we can\u2019t help it\u201d \u2013 it is about laying out the contributing factors to why things are as they are. My profession did not wake up one day, hold a secret meeting, and determine our contribution henceforth would be to amplify and abet the cultural and technological forces herding people into tribes. Truth is there\u2019s been a significant disruption to the way we do business, and we have had to respond to it. This isn\u2019t a plea bargain, this is a statutory declaration from a person living through a revolution in my own profession. Tracking back to the central question I wanted to focus on this weekend: am I part of an apparatus making things worse, when you assemble all the parts of the puzzle, the only honest answer to the question can be yes. Some days I wonder whether I can keep doing the job at all, given that knowledge. The insight induces profound anxiety, at least for me. But I know these things as well. Truth may not be enough, but it is all we have. History tells us that truth sometimes loses the battle with lies \u2013 that monsters, despots, and fiends sometimes prevail. But cycles also turn, particularly when good people maintain hope and strive to perform modest acts of good in the world. I know journalism at its best bears witness, and brings people verified facts. I know that honest, diligent reporting is an act of public service, an expression of modesty rather than hubris. I know reporting can change lives, it can speak for the powerless. Adequately resourced outlets can also stand and challenge the powerful when that job needs doing \u2013 which is most days in my experience. I have no idea whether the values that exemplify my professional life prevail over the grand sweep of history. But I know the core mission matters enough to persist.
