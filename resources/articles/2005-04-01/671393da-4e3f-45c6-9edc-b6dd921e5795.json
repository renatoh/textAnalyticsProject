The sign on a bridge beside a millpond read: \"To owners and drivers of traction engines ... this bridge is insufficient to carry weights beyond the ordinary traffic of the district.\" But it did not deter the stream of giant, international freight wagons hurtling north from Poole harbour. Relentless rain modified our plan for a hill walk and made places to shelter a priority, so we looked into Compton Abbas Church, found that it had been built in 1867 after the original church had fallen into decay, and read there of a 17th-century rector who had led a company of \"clubmen\" (so called because they were armed only with clubs), who believed that to oppose an anointed king was \"unnatural\" and so confronted Cromwell's troops on the iron-age fortress of Hambledon hill. The rector threatened to \"pistol\" any clubman who fled, but they were routed by a cavalry charge. We went down a steep track from the churchyard, past the old malthouse, and between cottages built mainly of the pale, local \"greensand\", and found our way to a triangular space by a lonely farmhouse, with a well-worn mounting-block at the entrance to the original churchyard, now a wilderness. A path beaten between the remains of old tombstones led to the derelict square tower where we sheltered in what had once been the porch, now cluttered with discarded fertiliser sacks and bins. It was a few miles to warm cover and a cup of tea at Compton Abbas Airfield, looking out at half a dozen small, wet and windswept aircraft."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
