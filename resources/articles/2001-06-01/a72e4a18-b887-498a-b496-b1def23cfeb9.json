The Palestinian information minister, Yasser Abed Rabbo, said he expected Israel to take substantial steps within 48 hours towards lifting its restrictions on the movement of Palestinians. Within a week, Israeli troops would have to withdraw to the positions they held before the outbreak of the fighting on September 28 last year, he added. The Israeli cabinet secretary, Gideon Saar, could not confirm this schedule but said that if the ceasefire was observed Israel would reciprocate rapidly. \"When the fire stops completely we will be able to see changes on the ground within a short period of time, regarding pulling back forces and returning life to normal,\" he told Israel radio. But it emerged yesterday that although the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, has accepted Mr Tenet's ceasefire plan he is refusing to sign it. The Palestinians are afraid that once a ceasefire is established the Israelis will be reluctant to implement other recommendations in the recent Mitchell report, such as a freeze on Jewish settlements. Abed Rabbo said: \"We are once again ready to give a chance for the peace process, on one condition: that there will be a complete implemen tation of all Mitchell's recommendations. That's why we did not sign the [Tenet] paper... it's a working plan for security but it's only one item in a total agreement.\" The Palestinians are also seeking international promises that the Mitchell report will be implemented fully. \"We will not sign any agreement if there is no international monitoring system to guarantee the implementation... of Mitchell's report as a whole,\" Mr Rabbo said. He added: \"Past experience has taught us that bilateral agreements are fragile and could be undermined unless there is an international guarantee with international monitoring.\" Mr Arafat finally accepted the ceasefire plan after receiving a letter from the European Union offering \"additional support\" on the implementation of Mitchell's proposals, Mr Rabbo said. The Palestinians' main remaining objection to the ceasefire plan concerns the creation of buffer zones to keep the sides apart. They say these amount to a \"re-occupation\" of their land by Israel. Although details of the ceasefire plan have not been officially released, the agreed version appears to have toned down earlier Israeli demands for a mass round-up of Hamas and Jihad militants. It does not mention either organisation, but lists 20 Palestinians who are regarded as explosives experts.
