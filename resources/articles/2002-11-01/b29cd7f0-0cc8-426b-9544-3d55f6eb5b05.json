Last week 24 students - all on release from their current jobs at universities - began the two-year course with a week-long residential introduction to strategic management. \"It's supposed to be for people who are perceived to be high flyers in the management of the universities,\" said Professor Gareth Williams, who helped design the course. Students include heads of departments, finance officers, departmental leaders, communication officers and deputy registrars from universities across the country. Professor Williams hopes the course will eventually attract academics. The first year looks at strategic, financial, estate and lifelong learning and quality management. Next year, students will explore the management of research and teaching and marketing. Other optional modules include university governance and academic freedom. The MBA will be, predominantly, a distance learning course, with a two and a half-week intensive residential block each year. Professor Williams hopes some recruits will go on to become heads of administration, heads of schools or university registrars, but in time he hopes one or two will become vice-chancellors. \"The aim is to try to create a common sense of community between the academics and managers in universities, which is why we are very keen to get more academics onto the course. There are some examples of administrative staff moving into vice-chancellor roles, but it's more likely that an academic will be our first student to get a vice-chancellor position.\" He added: \"One of the things we're trying to do is establish a network of people who have a modern, holistic and realistic view about management of universities.\" Most students are supported by their employers, although to varying degrees. Some paid the full \u00a35,250 course fees, others a contribution and some students are self-funding."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
