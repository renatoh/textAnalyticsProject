The warning comes as official figures show that wealthier, mostly Conservative-run parts of the country, where demand for care services is often lower, will be able to raise their social care budgets by three times as much as the poorest regions by using new powers to increase council tax, announced by the chancellor last week. The LGA says this will create a \u201cpostcode lottery\u201d for social care, in a funding system that completely fails to address the long-term needs of the elderly and those in need of help at home. Responding to calls for action to ease a nationwide funding crisis in social care, Osborne said in his autumn statement that local authorities will be allowed to raise council tax by up to 2% as long as the extra money is spent on social care. The rise in the number of elderly people \u2013 as well as a desire to keep them in their homes rather than looking after them incrowded hospitals \u2013 has placed local authority budgets under huge pressure. But the LGA, representing more than 370 local authorities in England and Wales, says that, while the new power to raise extra funds is welcome, towards devolution and greater flexibility, it will benefit richer regions most, as higher property values mean they can raise far more by increasing council tax. By contrast, poorer areas, where council tax accounts for a much smaller proportion of their total incomes, will be able to raise far less and will, as a result, be less able to offset the latest round of central government funding reductions. The LGA calculates that Osborne\u2019s latest cuts will mean a further 24% reduction in councils\u2019 core funding by 2020, on top of cuts of more than 40% in the last parliament. David Simmonds, the Tory vice-chair of the LGA and deputy council leader in the London borough of Hillingdon, said people in areas where property prices were lowest\u2013 and where council tax makes up a lower proportion of a council\u2019s income \u2013 would be able to provide only an \u201cabsolute minimum\u201d level of service from now on. Many of those councils would also refuse to impose council tax rises because local people would not be able to afford them, further worsening their plight. By contrast, better-off areas, where property values are higher and the council is in a better position to increase council tax, would be able to serve their elderly populations much better. \u201cIf you are in one of those areas with a very low council tax base, what you are likely to be saying is that, unless you are someone who physically cannot get out of bed, have a wash and feed yourself, or make a drink without someone coming round to your house, you are not going to get any help at all. In those wealthier areas, including mine, we are going to be saying we will provide a burglar alarm, a heater during the winter if the heating goes off, because we are in a stronger position to do that. That is the postcode lottery issue.\u201d Investigations by the Observer, based on detailed analysis of all councils\u2019 finances, show massive disparities in the ability to use council tax to offset central government cuts. While Knowsley in Merseyside will be able to raise its income by only 4.7% if it were to increase council tax by the maximum by 2019-20, its far wealthier near-neighbour, Cheshire East, willbe able to benefit to the tune of 11.6%. The London borough of Newham will be able to raise its funding by only 4.1% compared with 11.3% for Kingston-upon-Thames, 12.4% for Buckinghamshire and 13% for Wokingham in Surrey. The LGA\u2019s finance spokeswoman, Sharon Taylor, leader of Labour-controlled Stevenage borough council, said increases to the Better Care Fund \u2013 which aims to transform funding of health and social care \u2013 were welcome but would not come soon enough. \u201cCouncils will not see the money until 2017. We have got a crisis now in social care funding. Our services are at breaking point and they are at breaking point now,\u201d she said. A Department for Communities and Local Government spokesman said: \u201cThe social care precept is part of a wider \u00a33.5bn investment package to ensure councils can support older and vulnerable people in their area. \u201cIn particular, the increased and improved Better Care Fund will offer support to councils with greater demands for their social care services, on top of the funds they raise through the precept. \u201cThis is a short-sighted analysis from the LGA as we will be setting out proposals on changes to the local government finance system which will take into account the main sources of revenue currently available to councils, including council tax. \u201cCouncils will have almost \u00a3200bn to spend over this parliament, a cash terms increase and a reduction of just 1.7% in real terms each year.\u201d Meanwhile, the independent thinktank Social Market Foundation said Osborne\u2019s decision to scrap cuts to tax credits not only masked serious cuts down the line for those moving on to the new system of universal credit (UC) \u2013 but could also reduce the job incentives that UC was designed to bolster. The foundation said: \u201cTo protect existing tax credit claimants from losing out, the government is implementing a system of \u2018transitional protection\u2019, whereby an additional amount is paid to UC claimants to make up the shortfall. However, transitional protection ceases to apply if the family undergoes a change of circumstances, such as a partner moving in or out of the household. Changes in circumstances can also include moving home. \u201cSuppose a family was receiving transitional protection as a result of being moved from tax credits to UC. One partner is offered a better-paid job, but one that would require the family moving home. The family faces a dilemma. Do they move to take up the job offer, increasing their income but losing their transitional protection payments? Or do they refuse the job offer in order to continue the receipt of their transitional protection? \u201cThis example just illustrates precisely the kind of situation that universal credit was designed to avoid: a barrier to taking up better-paid work. The problem will be exacerbated in April 2016 when the cuts to UC create considerable differences in the generosity of tax credits as compared with universal credit.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
