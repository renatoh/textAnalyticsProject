On Wednesday the winger, who is no longer considered part of the first-team squad after a series of misdemeanours, posted a photograph on social media of himself wearing a mask alongside a barber wearing gloves. The post has been deleted but the 24-year-old\u2019s actions will have deeply disappointed Bournemouth, who have opened an investigation. Ibe said in a statement released through his representatives: \u201cI didn\u2019t think it through and I apologise. I made sure to wear protective equipment but I didn\u2019t realise it was in breach of the guidelines. There wasn\u2019t any intent to disobey the guidelines and as soon as it was brought to my attention, I took the post down immediately.\u201d Ibe\u2019s flouting of the government\u2019s physical-distancing guidelines comes three weeks after he was fined by the club for breaking the terms of a 16-month driving ban. Ibe was stopped behind the wheel by police despite being banned in March after crashing his car into a shop in Bromley, south-east London. This month Ibe said in a statement released by his representatives that he had entered rehabilitation to \u201cconcentrate on becoming a better person after making poor judgements\u201d. Tottenham, meanwhile, announced on Wednesday that they had launched an investigation after images emerged of Serge Aurier posing with a barber. Ibe has not played for Bournemouth\u2019s first team since September and had been training with the under-23s since December. Ibe arrived at Bournemouth from Liverpool in 2016 for a then club-record \u00a315m but is out of contract next month. A Bournemouth spokesman said: \u201cWe have launched an internal investigation, the outcome of which will remain confidential.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
