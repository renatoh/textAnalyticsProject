Research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies \u201cfound that where Sure Start offered high levels of service in poor neighbourhoods in England, visits to hospital to treat injuries fell among all children of primary school age, and by a third of all 11-year-olds\u201d. Tracy Brabin, the shadow early years minister, said: \u201cThis research shows the critical role Sure Start plays in children\u2019s health, as well as their development. But shamefully, over a thousand Sure Start centres have been lost through years of austerity, meaning children and families across the country are missing out.\u201d According to a 2018 study by the Sutton Trust, as many as 1,000 Sure Start children\u2019s centres may have been shut down in England since 2010.
