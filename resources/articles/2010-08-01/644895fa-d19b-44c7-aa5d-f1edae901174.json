Well, the next few days will most probably be soundtracked by a fusillade of popping corks, as Lloyds, RBS and other high-street banks put out bumper half-year performance reports. The question is whether politicians, policymakers and regulators will be getting anxious enough. To some it will sound perverse to fret at all about the news that financial institutions are returning to profit and getting back to health. They have a point. After all, it was three years ago this month that the banking industry had the first serious tremors, as the credit crunch began, in what turned out to be a near-fatal heart attack. So if the big five banks did manage to make over \u00a38bn in profits over the past six months, this is surely all to the good. Not only does it mean that the institutions are getting closer to the day when they can come off state-funded life support; it also suggests that taxpayers have an even better chance of getting their money back from RBS and Lloyds, the two banks that they largely own. The next few days are likely to see less mention from the City of bad loans and impairment charges and debt restructuring and all the other accounting terminology of doom that observers have got so used to since August 2007. What in that list, one might fairly ask, is a cause for complaint? And one might fairly answer: plenty. For a start, many of the people who drove these banks to the corporate cliff edge remain in place. Eric Daniels, for instance, remains chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group \u2013 despite having engineered the 2008 purchase of HBOS that nearly killed off his company. Nor have the City executives learned their lessons about clamping down on excessive pay. It may be that this year's payouts are not quite as soaraway as those in 2009, but that will be down to markets now being less frothy (in the wake of the Greek crisis, and with no more free cash \u2013 or quantitative easing, as it was technically known \u2013 from the Bank of England). The proportion of bank revenues being poured into staff payouts remains far too high, as more thoughtful regulators will admit. Finally, the problem of banks being too big to fail has not gone away \u2013 indeed, in some cases it has got worse. This week will see Spanish bank Santander buying 318 branches of RBS \u2013 to add to the pile of British high-street names it has already swallowed up, including Abbey, Alliance &amp; Leicester (bought not long after Northern Rock fell over) and the profitable bits of Bradford &amp; Bingley (pocketed within days of Lehman Brothers going bust). That deal has been forced on RBS by EU watchdogs \u2013 but there remain legitimate concerns about the way that new chief Stephen Hester has ramped up his bank's investment-banking business. One of the major reasons that RBS came to grief was that it was a high-street bank that thought it could act like a City boutique: the current combination of (Brussels-imposed) branch sales and continued interest in investment banking has done little to change that, as Friday's results will confirm. Regulators should continue to watch this firm. And that, ultimately, is the biggest risk in this results season: that the officials take their feet off the necks of the bankers, even while taxpayers continue to pay for the fecklessness of financiers. Yes, there has been the odd penalty for Wall Street firms or Northern Rock directors, and true, George Osborne and Vince Cable continue to heckle bankers for not lending more to businesses. But as last week's green paper on banking made clear, the coalition \u2013 despite a willingness to be more radical on the City than Gordon Brown or Alistair Darling ever were \u2013 is no clearer about what is to be done. Which means structural reform of Britain's most dangerous industry remains a faint hope rather than a firm prospect."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
