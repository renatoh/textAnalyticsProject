Nothing unusual about that, except the pugilists are not Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder, or any of the sport\u2019s big names, but two YouTube stars without a professional bout between them, fighting to settle a beef. The UK\u2019s KSI \u2013 real name Olajide William Olatunji \u2013 and Logan Paul from the US first fought to a draw last year in a white collar event at Manchester Arena livestreamed on YouTube\u2019s pay-per-view platform, billed as the biggest internet event in history. This time the stakes are higher as they have turned professional, which means no headguards and lighter gloves, increasing the chance of a knockout. The bout is being held at the Staples Center in Los Angeles and is promoted by one of the sport\u2019s leading promoters, Eddie Hearn. In the UK, it will be shown on Sky Sports Box Office, a platform popularised by fighters such as Ricky Hatton, Naseem Hamed, Anthony Joshua and Floyd Mayweather. \u201cIt\u2019s a joke,\u201d said Rudy Genovese of the Paul v KSI fight. Genovese, who has been \u201cboxing all my life\u201d, was finishing off a sparring session at the Times amateur boxing club in north London, with some resistance exercises. \u201cThey will get hurt,\u201d he said, before correcting himself: \u201cBut they won\u2019t because they can\u2019t fight.\u201d Genovese, 51, a taxi driver, said his sons watched the first fight on YouTube. He had not really paid attention but saw enough to put him off. Tom Collins, a fellow cabbie who had earlier shared the ring with Genovese, was more positive. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good thing,\u201d said the 40-year-old. \u201cWe want anything that will stop kids stabbing each other and [get them to go] training. If a fraction of the viewers get into boxing and take up the sport, that has to be a good thing.\u201d In the shadow of a Muhammad Ali poster with the slogan \u201cThe pain you feel today is the strength you feel tomorrow,\u201d Genovese remained unconvinced. \u201cWhat they [the viewers] are seeing is not boxing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyone can put gloves on but not everyone can box. They\u2019re doing it without putting in the hard work and sweat.\u201d No one in the gym was planning to stump up Sky\u2019s \u00a39.95fee, although Genovese conceded his sons would probably watch it. Questions were also asked about how the pair obtained professional licences. The British Boxing Board of Control (BBBoC) has no jurisdiction over the fight because it is in the US. Its rules usually demand experience in amateur boxing, with exceptions if there has been \u201cproper and good tuition\u201d under a professional trainer. Last year it refused the former England footballer Rio Ferdinand a licence. Including their last fight, KSI and Paul have three amateur fights between them (the Briton fought another YouTube star previously). KSI is being coached by Viddal Riley, a British boxer with three professional bouts to his name, while Paul\u2019s trainer is the former world heavyweight title holder Shannon Briggs, who has been unable to obtain a licence to fight since failing a drugs test. KSI, 26, shot to fame through videos of him playing the videogame Fifa, while Paul, 24, made his name making shareable videos on the now-defunct Vine platform. Both internet stars have attracted controversy: Paul when posting a video showing the body of an apparent suicide victim, while KSI was accused of making sexist comments in his earlier videos. The disquiet among boxing fans has been exacerbated by the presence of two bonafide boxing world champions, the Briton Billie Joe Saunders and rising US star Devin Haney, on the undercard, although neither of them seem bothered. Before KSI and Paul fought last year, Hearn said the bout was embarrassing and that, as a boxing enthusiast, \u201cI don\u2019t think I could stand up there and sell, and be a part of that.\u201d However, money talks. The protagonists each have about 20 million YouTube subscribers and more than 9bn views between them. Announcing the rematch, Hearn said witnessing the first fight he saw \u201ca phenomenon, a sold-out arena, more than 1m pay-per-view buys but more importantly an energy of a new audience to the sport of boxing\u201d. He has suggested the worldwide audience could be more than 50 million \u2013 although promoters are prone to exaggeration \u2013 so retaining the interest of a fraction would boost the sport. But despite seeing the positives, Collins was clear why Sky and Hearn were involved: \u201cAs soon as they see a pound note, they\u2019re going to go after it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
