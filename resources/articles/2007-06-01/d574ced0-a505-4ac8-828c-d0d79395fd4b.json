Peter Kenyon, the FA Cup holders' chief executive, was quoted in Israel yesterday as saying: \"Ben Haim will arrive, we will discuss his contract and finalise the last details and we hope that he will sign the contract by tomorrow.\" Ben Haim was on Jose Mourinho's shopping list during the January transfer window but Chelsea could not agree a fee with Bolton. Injuries to John Terry and Ricardo Carvalho hampered Chelsea's campaign and the midfielder Michael Essien had to play in defence for a chunk of the season. Now that Ben Haim is out of contract at the Reebok Stadium the 25-year-old looks set to become the latest player to move to Stamford Bridge on a free this summer, following Steve Sidwell and Claudio Pizarro. The Brazilian defender Alex is expected to join from PSV for a token $1 (50p). Although Ben Haim's former manager at Bolton, Sam Allardyce, is planning a last-ditch effort to tempt him to Newcastle United, sources close to the player said yesterday that he had made up his mind. \"Tal will sign at Chelsea, not because of the money but because of footballing reasons,\" one source said. \"He wants to play in the Champions League. He is not afraid of competition and believes he can gain a place with the first team.\" Ben Haim is a key player for Israel and may be joined at Chelsea by Avram Grant, the former Israel manager who is Portsmouth's technical director. Ben Haim's international team-mate Yossi Benayoun is keen to join Liverpool. The midfielder has agreed terms with West Ham United on a new contract worth about \u00a350,000 a week but has not signed it because he was aware of interest from the Anfield club, who are offering lower wages. Liverpool have offered West Ham about \u00a33m but were told Benayoun is not for sale. Ronen Katzav, his agent, said yesterday: \"We will sit tomorrow with West Ham and see where we are going to go. It is an unpleasant situation after we agreed terms but we will fight it. If West Ham decide not to sell him [we will have to accept it] - he is theirs. We will try to talk to them and convince them to let Yossi go.\" West Ham hope to tie up a deal for Charlton's Darren Bent. They were reported last night to have agreed a transfer for the striker worth a club-record \u00a317m, with the England international considering whether to make the move or hold out for alternatives. West Ham's offer is believed to comprise \u00a316m plus the midfielder Hayden Mullins, with whom the Charlton manager, Alan Pardew, worked at Upton Park. Bent has been offered huge wages, reportedly \u00a375,000 a week, to persuade him to move to Upton Park."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
