He has rejected the BBC\u2019s latest apology over the circumstances in which Martin Bashir convinced his sister to take part in the 1995 interview, where she frankly discussed the collapse of her marriage to Prince Charles. \u201cWhen the BBC say they\u2019ve \u2018apologised\u2019 to me, what they\u2019ve apologised for is showing me false bank statements relating to a lesser, unrelated, matter,\u201d Earl Spencer said on Wednesday. \u201cThey haven\u2019t apologised for the fake bank statements and other deceit that led to me introducing Martin Bashir to my sister.\u201d Bashir was cleared of wrongdoing after a 1996 internal investigation led by the then head of news, Tony Hall, who later became the the corporation\u2019s director general. The reporter had ordered a BBC graphic designer to mock up fake bank statements that gave the impression people close to the Spencer family were selling stories to newspapers. Spencer said he was never consulted regarding the initial investigation into the circumstances surrounding the interview. \u201cThe BBC has shown itself incapable of honestly facing up to the ugly truth of this matter,\u201d he said. The BBC has said it is willing to consider any new information provided by Spencer, but it is understood the corporation has yet to receive additional evidence. The situation has been complicated by Bashir\u2019s health; he is severely ill with complications from Covid-19. Internal BBC documents released under the Freedom of Information Act and seen by the Daily Mail reveal new information about how Lord Hall cleared Bashir. He concluded that the reporter \u201cwasn\u2019t thinking\u201d when he asked the graphic designer to produce the fake bank statements. According to the documents, Hall concluded: \u201cI believe he is, even with his lapse, honest and an honourable man. He is contrite.\u201d Spencer has alleged that in addition to the fake bank documents, Bashir claimed to have \u201cevidence of senior members of the royal family saying or doing appalling things \u2013 wishing members of my family dead; fathering a child that had to be aborted\u201d. Interest in the circumstances of the interview \u2013 which took place 25 years ago this week \u2013 has been reawakened by a Channel 4 documentary into how Bashir got the story. It revealed that Matt Wiessler, the graphic designer who mocked up the bank statements under direction from Bashir, left the corporation soon after the incident."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
