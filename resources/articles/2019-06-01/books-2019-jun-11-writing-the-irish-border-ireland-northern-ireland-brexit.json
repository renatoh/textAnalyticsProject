When it comes to writers from the border regions, they may mention Brian Friel or Seamus Heaney, but for most people, the border between the republic and Northern Ireland is usually regarded as an area whose existence is contentious, where terms are unfavourable and the writing is characteristically unfeminine. It is an area that Labour\u2019s former secretary of state for Northern Ireland Merlyn Rees referred to as \u201cbandit country\u201d in 1974, and perceptions have been slow to shift. Yet the region has catalysed some of the country\u2019s finest writing and never more so than today. Since the Good Friday agreement, the border region is no longer the insular, provincial place you\u2019ve read about. These days it\u2019s the setting for hit TV comedies about teenage friendships, Michael Portillo train documentaries, pioneering city of culture bids, and parody Twitter accounts. Suddenly the border seems the whip-smart, funny and sophisticated breeding ground its inhabitants always knew it was. It\u2019s also become a political centre of attention again, thanks to Brexit, and its writers and artists are no longer willing to relinquish control of its narrative. Of this recent crop of writers, perhaps the best known is poet and editor Colette Bryce. Having grown up amid the often male-dominated, oppressive environment of Troubles-era Derry, Bryce relocated to Scotland in 2002 before transferring to the south of England to become editor of Poetry London. In 2003 she won the National Poetry Competition for The Full Indian Rope Trick, a searing meditation on the possibility of escape and self-realisation. The following year, her collection of the same name (Picador, 2005) was shortlisted for the TS Eliot prize. Bryce\u2019s work has been variously described as \u201csatisfying, convincing [and] light-as-a-feather\u201d and \u201cfilled \u2026 with the impulse to get out and away\u201d, but with the publication of The Whole and Rain-Domed Universe (Picador, 2014) she made an unflinching return to her Derry roots. In her poem North and South, the border is a \u201cbarely controllable thing / to be wrestled\u201d. In Helicopters, it features as \u201cthe head wound of an animal\u201d attended by \u201ca business of flies\u201d. To Bryce, the border is a living thing; a man-made creature with a pulse and form and riven through with the worst impulses humanity has to offer. \u201cThe fallout from Brexit, with its attendant strains of racism and populism, is going to affect all of our literature,\u201d she says. \u201cI wish that wasn\u2019t the case. \u201cThe ease of travel and reduced visibility has been so important for peace in recent years. The timing is particularly regrettable, given the approaching centenary of partition \u2013 an old wound for many in the north. And we had only just marked, with a kind of quiet relief, 20 years since the Good Friday agreement. It\u2019s hard to believe the complete lack of consideration given to any of this by the Tories when they called their ill-fated referendum.\u201d Novelist and Keady native Michael Hughes echoes many of these sentiments. Born during a particularly chaotic period in the Troubles to a respectable south Armagh family, Hughes came late to writing. His first novel, The Countenance Divine, was published in 2016 to rapturous praise, and earned him lofty comparisons with AS Byatt, Hilary Mantel and David Mitchell. It wasn\u2019t until 2018, when the full extent of the Brexit crisis was finally realised, that Hughes turned his attention to the border of his youth. Set after a fictionalised version of the IRA ceasefire in the mid-1990s, Country recalibrates The Iliad for a jaded, war-weary generation \u2013 casting the Border Sniper as Achilles, a brutal paramilitary leader named Pig as Agamemnon, and an SAS captain named Henry as Hector. What follows is brutal, detailed and often funny, though what jumps out right away is Hughes\u2019s ear for the harsh, cutting dialect of the south Armagh border region. \u201cThis is a good one,\u201d the Border Sniper often begins his anecdotes. \u201cWait now till you hear.\u201d Hughes says of his decision to write about the border: \u201cNow that it has come to mean less and has moved more into the realm of folk memory, its inhabitants are naturally starting to pay attention to themselves. Scrutiny tells you who you are. \u201cGrowing up on the border used to promote an unofficial sense of lawlessness, and I think that \u2013 far from us wanting to eclipse Belfast or Dublin \u2013 we were kind of delighted to be out of the spotlight. Now we\u2019re getting used to the focus being on us.\u201d Of course, not all writers from the border are as keen to have the border defined by conflict. In 2017, Derry poet Susannah Dickey published her debut pamphlet I Had Some Very Slight Concerns \u2013 a blisteringly funny, often lateral rumination on ontology and the frailty of the human condition. In 2018, her follow-up, Genuine Human Values, was published to further praise and, later this year, her debut novel Tennis Lessons is set to be released by Doubleday. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing about borders,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m a border, you\u2019re a border \u2026 Growing up in Derry meant growing accustomed to external perceptions of identity which were often reductive and binary, and in my own writing I attempt to write the experience I had, which was one of much greater fluidity than what might be expected.\u201d Similarly, though the work of Donegal writer Annemarie N\u00ed Churre\u00e1in is steeped in the windswept landscape and harsh character of Ireland\u2019s north-west, her borders are more to do with the divided self. As she puts it: \u201cI write to explore emotional experiences through the physicality of rural landscapes.\u201d And indeed, it would be hard to argue with this assessment of her work. In 2017, she published her debut poetry collection Bloodroot \u2013 a book so explicitly about the inseparability of body and landscape that both are in constant communication with one another. \u201cThe first time a tree / called me by name,\u201d N\u00ed Churre\u00e1in writes in End of Girlhood. \u201cI was 13 and only spoke a weave of ordinary tongues.\u201d Ireland\u2019s landscape and the historic violence committed against its women are open wounds running through society, N\u00ed Churre\u00e1in seems to argue, and in this way she shares some of the same ideas as Bryce. About how the border enacts its divisions as a living, tangible being; about how it consumes its subjects at the same time that it attaches itself to them. Darran Anderson understands only too well the importance that a sense of place like this has. As a writer and academic from Derry, Anderson\u2019s focus has tended toward psychogeography in general and architecture in particular. In 2016 he published Imaginary Cities, an excellent study into the history of planned urban centres that never came into being. \u201cIt\u2019s just a fiction with the weight of a state behind it to try and make it seem real,\u201d Anderson has said of the border in Ireland. \u201cI live in England now, and when people ask me about it and talk in political terms, I always emphasise how psychological its presence was and remains. \u201cThe constant oppressive low-level anxiety of the border \u2026 The great conjuring trick of the Good Friday agreement is that they made it disappear so that people on all sides could believe they\u2019d somehow won a conflict in which everyone had really lost.\u201d It\u2019s hard for this generation \u2013 who mostly came of age after the Troubles \u2013 to conceive of anything other than peace, and perhaps some of Anderson\u2019s pessimism comes from the fact that the current Brexit debate has thrown the border\u2019s status into uncertainty once again. Peace in the north of Ireland has been hard won and is often still contentious. In January 2019, a car bomb exploded outside the courthouse in Derry and was, according to police, \u201cminutes\u201d away from killing a group of teenagers who were passing. In March, the same dissident republican paramilitary who perpetrated the attack \u2013 a group calling themselves the New IRA \u2013 sent letter bombs to locations in Glasgow, London and Dublin. The threat of violence in the north of Ireland is real, ever-present and weighted with the baggage of colonial misadventure. We can only hope that we don\u2019t witness another generation marred by the violence of the past, and instead get to hear from more of the kind of engaged, politically astute voices who have been documenting Ireland\u2019s border and redefining it. As Derry poet Emily Cooper puts it: \u201cIt\u2019s almost like the spotlight has been shone on us after many years of darkness and we were all here tapping away waiting to explain what it\u2019s been like.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
