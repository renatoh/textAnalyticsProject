If you are about to build one out of an existing classroom or a reformatted toilet or cloakroom, don't worry: it may well be right for your school at this stage. But make no mistake that in five years' time, we'll consider it strange. Because then we will not be taking the student to the computer but fitting computers to the classroom. Just what is a computer anyway? Portable technology like the Lego brick is actually a powerful programmable computer; mobile phones will soon be smarter than many desktop PCs in terms of processing power; and the latest Apple iBook doubles as a video-editing suite when you plug in a camera yet it's as mobile as a large handbag. It looks sensible to plan for a future which is portable but also needs to be collaborative and mediated, bringing ICT to all classrooms and putting these tools into teachers' hands. There are several strands to the successful classroom integration of ICT, some technological, some philosophical. Schools should start to plan now for ICT that is accessible throughout the school, not just in a single room. The options include ordinary networks or wireless connections. Cornwallis school, Maidstone, now has a wireless network for over 100 Acer laptops. The Isle of Man recently invested in 600 wireless AirPort cards fitted to Apple laptops for teachers, which allows teachers to move through the class and still access the internet or the classroom printer. \"Ninety-five per cent of primary schools have laptops wirelessly connected to school networks,\" says John Thornley, an Isle of Man ICT adviser. \"The benefit is sheer convenience. In a history lesson a teacher can walk around class, call up work from the school server, review it with a child, and move on to the next pupil.\" A key part of the island's ICT strategy over the past five years has been to put portable computers into the hands of the teachers and the success of this shows the power of computers as a teacher's resource. To make the biggest difference the message is clear: send a computer to the front of every class, preferably with a large screen display or a data projector and pop a portable into every teacher's satchel. Once teachers can teach, using the power of ICT from the front of the classroom, everything changes. Maybe it's not just \"hands on\" but \"eyes up\" as the teacher takes the whole class through effective use of new software. Students have learned nuclear physics without direct experiment, but where ICT is concerned we seem to think it requires hands on at all times and it shouldn't.'' Research also suggests ICT is used best when children work in pairs rather than alone at a computer. It's probably also better to use a computer when they need to rather than because it's 2pm on a Thursday for their lesson in the computer room. \"We are now trialling the wireless system with pupils,\" says John Thornley. \"When you march them off to the computer room there is discontinuity; this way the ICT comes to the child.\" As more children have computers at home, the more perplexed they will be at a special lesson in their honour. For those without a home PC it may well be better if it's part of the classroom rather than a bi-weekly orchestrated event. Some schools will fit clusters of computers in corridor cloakrooms, some will run a large distributed network around school and others will buy class sets of cut-down laptops like the AlphaSmart (TAG) which let students write, edit and print using infrared connections on a small portable device costing less than \u00a3190. As computers spread through school, a thematic approach will emerge with machines grouped according to curricular purpose and integrated according to school design. Two machines for control work in the technology room, three machines (portable or otherwise) with midi keyboards in a music area will become the order of the day. Schools should stand up for the right to be flexible in the integration of ICT in the classroom. It's worth noting that the most innovative practice comes from those for whom the strictures of the national curriculum are optional. From here on in, start centralised but plan localised. It's not an argument of laptops versus computers rooms but a case of integration versus isolation. For each school planning its path, it is important that it is guided primarily by how it wants to use ICT as a learning tool rather than building a room just to jump through an Ofstedian hoop.
