When the devil takes the hindmost these days, he does it with a smirk. An own-goal in a season of self-inflicted damage was an apt way for the final indignity to befall a side of unrelenting mediocrity. Damien Duff was one of Shearer's better players in this failed survival attempt but Duff's conversion from left-winger to left-back was emblematic of Newcastle's chaotic team-building in the years since Sir Bobby Robson was sacked for finishing fourth, third and fifth. In a defensive position that is still alien to him, Duff instinctively stuck out a leg to stop a Gareth Barry shot and deflected it into his own net. For some this would have qualified as a hard-luck tale. But Newcastle flirted with calamity all season. Even under Shearer their record was one win from eight games, against Middlesbrough, at home. The upsurge never came. Among the myths exposed by the latest manager's spirited attempt to break the fall is that Newcastle can always fall back on \"passion\". With a few honourable exceptions, there was precious little of that in a side that won seven of their 38 matches and performed like strangers in the night. \"The three worst teams deserved to go down. Unfortunately Newcastle were one of them,\" Shearer conceded. \"You get what you deserve after 38 games. I'm hurt, I'm raw inside, as are a lot of people in the dressing room. Big changes need to be made.\" Right up until kick-off it had felt unthinkable that a club with a 56,000-seat stadium could be marched down the Premier League's long gravel drive and dumped at the gate. We should know better than to be seduced by scale or fanaticism. The collapse of Leeds United provided a template for big clubs blundering over cliffs. Another notion we should probably never take seriously again is that a rich speculator can pick a club with a distinctive culture off the menu of investment opportunities and lead it to the promised land, as Mike Ashley tried to do with a series of random executive appointments that exploded in his face. Shearer is Newcastle's fourth manager this season. \"I came in expecting to turn things round,\" he said. He wore a look of shock, and shame at the depth of the mess he inherited. Nobody dies on Sadistic Sunday, or whatever label it now wears. Relegation is synthetic tragedy. But it still hurts. It is a dunce's cap in an industry that is all about power and money and self-inflation. Middlesbrough went down making comparatively small errors. West Brom sank playing good football. Newcastle, on the other hand, went under with their underpants on their head, which is doubly humiliating for their fans. As Shearer said: \"They love their football and they love their football club but they've been badly let down.\" When Graeme Souness was asked about Ashley's proposed takeover of the Tyneside club, the former manager said gravely: \"A big football club with big problems.\" From 6pm yesterday Newcastle are a smaller club with even bigger problems \u2013 principally, if one claim is accurate, 15 players on \u00a350,000-plus a week and no relegation clauses in their contracts, which means that their salaries will be unaffected by the huge drop in income. That means the likes of Joey Barton can stay umbilically connected to the flow of easy money that has helped turn a fervently supported institution into a standing joke across the rest of the Premier League. Michael Owen, and others, are out of contract and will leave anyway. Whoever the manager is next season \u2013 Shearer will meet the board this week to discuss his own position \u2013 will have to slice through a jungle of contracts and constraints to rebuild the side. The purge will not be easy. Ashley's own next move comes into play. First he put the club up for sale and then took it off the market. Will he absorb the fresh losses that relegation will bring or is he already pulling on his running shoes to head for the hills? \"I can understand why people say it's an addictive job,\" Shearer said, offering one glint of light to those who hope he will be the one to hose out a ruined squad. To do so he would have to be given the kind of autonomy enjoyed by the Premier League's top managers, without interference from directors of football, chief scouts and egotistical owners or their pals. Back in the days when the sleeping giant was raising an eyelid, Sir John Hall said, infamously: \"We're like the Basques. We are fighting for a nation, the Geordie nation. Football is tribalism and we're Mohicans.\" Mohicans: not the best analogy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
