Exit polls found that more than 80% of New Hampshire Democratic voters felt \u201cangry\u201d about the Trump administration. All four prosecutors who tried Roger Stone in November have resigned after the president tweeted criticism of their sentencing suggestion and the Justice Department revised the recommendation. Trump said the military may consider disciplining Lt Col Alexander Vindman, who delivered damaging testimony in the impeachment inquiry and was fired last week. Follow the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the New Hampshire primaries: Like many New Hampshire voters, Shalimar, who works as an interpreter in Manchester and who was reluctant to give her last name, confessed that she was still undecided as she entered her local polling place this afternoon, in the third ward of the city. She was wavering between a vote for Bernie Sanders and former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick. How would she choose between them? \u201cAsk God to guide my hand,\u201d she said, laughing. She added that she\u2019d also found Amy Klobuchar impressive but feared the senator\u2019s gender would prove an obstacle. \u201cI don\u2019t think America\u2019s ready for that, for a woman being in that office. I think we\u2019ve gone backwards.\u201d She said that she worried about Sanders\u2019 \u201cage and health\u201d but above all she was anxious at what Donald Trump would do if elected to a second term. \u201cI\u2019m very scared,\u201d she said. Jeannie Peschier, aged 57 and a carer for her elderly father, had suffered no last-minute hesitation. She was all in for Sanders. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get rid of that bozo,\u201d she said of Trump. \u201cBernie is the one with the integrity, the consistency - he\u2019s bold like FDR. He\u2019s for us regular people who run out of money at the end of the month.\u201d Did she share the much-discussed fears over Sanders\u2019 electability? \u201cNo. He\u2019s a populist like Trump. He\u2019ll know what to do. Bernie will kick his butt. Trump will be in the corner crying after Bernie gets done with him.\u201d Aaron Zelinsky, Jonathan Kravis, Adam Jed and Michael Marando \u2014 the four prosecutors who tried Roger Stone in November \u2014 have exited. After Trump tweeted their sentencing recommendation of 7-9 years for Stone was a \u201cmiscarriage of justice,\u201d the justice department changed the recommendation. A spokesperson for the department said there was no coordination with Trump. Even as he criticized the sentencing of Stone, the president appeared to endorse a harsher disciplining of Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council aide who provided damaging testimony in Trump\u2019s impeachment inquiry and was fired from his job last week. Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump said the military may consider disciplinary action against Vindman. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be up to the military, we\u2019ll have to see, but if you look at what happened, they\u2019re going to certainly, I would imagine, take a look at that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe military can handle him.\u201d New Hampshire Democratic voters are angry about the Trump administration, a CNN exit poll found. The majority \u2014 62% \u2014 said Democrats should nominate a candidate who can beat Trump rather than someone who agrees with them on issues. Ahead of the election today, Bernie Sanders had been leading in polls, followed closely by Pete Buttigieg. The CNN exit poll found that 60% of the voters in New Hampshire decided who they\u2019d vote for this month \u2014 and more than half of them made up their minds in the past few days. The results are based on interviews conducted throughout the day with nearly 2,000 Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire. At the White House, Donald Trump attacked federal prosecutors involved in the Roger Stone case. \u201cI thought the whole prosecution was ridiculous,\u201d he said. I thought it was an insult to our country and it shouldn\u2019t happen.\u201d The prosecutors \u2014 three of whom have exited the Justice Department after Trump tweeted criticism of their sentencing recommendation in the Stone case \u2014 \u201c are the same Mueller people that put everybody through hell,\u201d Trump added. Meanwhile, Chuck Schumer \u2014 the Senate minority leader \u2014 has sent a letter to the Justice Department\u2019s watchdog to investigate the reduced sentence recommendation for Stone. It\u2019s primary day in New Hampshire and here\u2019s where we are: A close race in the Granite State primary had senator Bernie Sanders facing down former mayor Pete Buttigieg, senator Elizabeth Warren, former veep Joe Biden and others. Senator Amy Klobuchar seemed to be heading into election night with a head of steam, but she is working her way up from quite a ways back in the polls and time was short. Biden made headlines \u2013 the wrong kind of headlines \u2013 this morning when he announced he was not sticking around for the results to come in in New Hampshire. He decamped for South Carolina, the next contest, where he hopes to finally gain some traction with voters. The first exit polls, which can indicate features of the electorate including their top issues of concern \u2013 but which also can be misleading if too much extrapolation is performed \u2013 are due at 5pm. Most polls close at 7pm ET, though some will stay open as late as 8pm, and results are expected soon after that. In non-presidential-campaign news, three prosecutors in the case of Donald Trump crony Roger Stone resigned on Tuesday following a Trump tweet criticizing the justice department\u2019s sentencing recommendation in the case and a subsequent announcement that the department was reversing that recommendation. Whatever is happening behind the scenes in the justice department\u2019s prosecution of Roger Stone, a large chunk of the team that had, until the day Donald Trump tweeted about the case, been running the prosecution now wants no part of it: Off the campaign trail for a moment \u2013 in an accelerating chain of events initiated by a Donald Trump tweet criticizing federal prosecutors for recommending 7-9 years in prison for Trump pal Roger Stone, two prosecutors in the case have resigned their positions. Former justice department officials warned that the appearance was strong that someone acting on direct or tacit orders from the president had intervened in the case of Stone, the president\u2019s friend and longtime adviser, tipping the scales of justice in Stone\u2019s favor. The departure of the prosecutors was a highly unusual twist after the justice department reversed its sentencing recommendations just one day after making them. No explicit reasoning was given for the resignations but one prosecutor noted the resignation was effective \u201cimmediately after this filing\u201d. Following the resignation from the case of prosecutor Aaron Zelinksy earlier today, prosecutor Jonathan Kravis has told the court that \u201che has resigned as an Assistant United States Attorney and therefore no longer represents the the government in this matter.\u201d Zelinksy will remain assistant US attorney in Maryland while Kravis leaves the justice department. Stone was found guilty of lying to Congress, obstruction of justice and witness tampering in a case related to the special counsel Robert Mueller investigation. After Trump tweeted this morning that the sentencing recommendation was a \u201cmiscarriage of justice,\u201d the justice department changed the recommendation of a 7-9 year sentence. \u201cThe department finds the recommendation extreme and excessive and disproportionate to Stone\u2019s offences,\u201d an anonymous source told the Washington Post. \u201cThe department will clarify its position later today.\u201d A justice department spokesperson insisted there had been no coordination with Trump. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer has called for an investigation by the justice department inspector general. And many former justice department officials and others are sounding a note of alarm: It\u2019s a quadrennial tradition in New Hampshire: candidates pop up at polling stations as voters cast their ballots in the state\u2019s first-in-the-nation-primary. Elizabeth Warren visited a handful of polling stations today, delivering Dunkin\u2019 Donuts coffee and Munchkins to volunteers who line the sidewalks with posters. At a stop in Nashua, her supporters chanted \u201cJust two cents\u201d \u2013 a reference to her wealth tax \u2013 and \u201cC-F-P-B. She fights for you. She fights for me.\u201d When Warren arrived, a crush of cameras and supporters rushed to the senator. One woman wiped tears from her eyes. Another thanked her for running. \u201cI got up at 6am to vote for you,\u201d another volunteer said. The Massachusetts senator shook hands and took actual selfies \u2013 as opposed to the photographs she takes in her famous, if controversially named, \u201cselfie line.\u201d Afterward, she took a handful of questions from journalists. One reporter asked what message it sent to the voters of New Hampshire that Joe Biden was leaving the state for South Carolina on Tuesday night instead of staying to attend his primary night party. \u201cI think it says that he\u2019s not here to fight for the votes in New Hampshire,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that this is what democracy is about. You get out there, you talk to voters and we fight for every vote. That\u2019s who I am. I am a fighter.\u201d Let s/he among us who has not \u201ceeny-meeny-miny-moe\u2019d it\u201d when faced with a major life decision cast the first stone. (We disagree strenuously with the notion that undecided voters are morons.) Senator Warren making a last-minute play for Biden backers: Ber-neigh: It\u2019s a foul day in New Hampshire, but that hasn\u2019t stopped Gail Proctor from standing outside her polling station in Wilton, where she is holding a sign saying: \u201cMake America kind again\u201d. With less than six hours until the polls closed, Proctor, 69, is still undecided, although she has managed to narrow it down to three people. \u201cElizabeth, because she\u2019s so smart and I feel she\u2019s the one with the skills, the ability and the experience to deal with what\u2019s really wrong in America, which is the money, the corporatists,\u201d Proctor said. \u201cThen my heart\u2019s always with Bernie, but I worry about electability. And then Pete.\u201d Karon Walker, 61, was also positioned outside Wilton town hall, about 25 miles south-west of Manchester. Walker was encouraging Proctor to vote for Buttigieg. \u201cHe\u2019s my man, he\u2019s terrific. The antithesis of what we have in the Oval Office right now,\u201d Walker said. She was a Republican, until Trump won the party\u2019s nomination in 2016. \u201cThe Republican party is now Trump\u2019s party, with the exception of Mitt Romney,\u201d Walker said. She decided Buttigieg was her candidate all the way back in April. \u201cPete\u2019s intelligence and compassion and thoughtfulness and his demeanour, frankly. he\u2019s Not gonna get dragged into the fray,\u201d Walker said. \u201cWherever Donald Trump goes he creates havoc. And I think that if you allow yourself to be drawn into that and argue with him on his own terms, you\u2019ve already lost. And I don\u2019t think Pete does that.\u201d Proctor and Walker were joined by Gail Hoar, 79, an artist who lives nearby. Hoar was voting for Amy Klobuchar, who has made a late surge in New Hampshire. \u201cShe\u2019s bright, she\u2019s non-divisive she has not taken a stand that castigates other people. If she differs on policy she says: \u2018We differ on policy but we\u2019re together,\u2019\u201d Hoar said. \u201cAlso she is somebody that I think many people can relate to. I can\u2019t find a negative about her. She has not gone too far on the healthcare too quickly. We need to get to where Bernie is but we need to take time to get there.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Lauren Gambino is in Nashua: How will tonight go for the candidates? Who\u2019s laying wagers? Biden might cut this factoid out to hang on the fridge: Sanders: \u2018We have a chance to do really, really well here tonight.\u201d via @politico: No comment from Biden on the Bloomberg-versus-Trump war of words: Update: Here\u2019s more Biden-about-town: After deleting a tweet calling Michael Bloomberg \u201cracist\u201d (see earlier), Donald Trump sent a new tweet with the same charge (see earlier). Bloomberg has responded in a statement: \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s deleted tweet is the latest example of his endless efforts to divide Americans.\u201d Bloomberg says. He said Trump \u201cinherited a country marching towards greater equality and divided us with racist appeals and hateful rhetoric. The challenge of the moment is clear: We must confront this president and do everything we can to defeat him. The president\u2019s attack on me clearly reflects his fear over the growing strength of my campaign. \u201cMake no mistake Mr. President: I am not afraid of you and I will not let you bully me or anyone else in America. Between now and November, I will do everything I can to defeat you whether I am on the ballot or not.\u201d Bill Gardner, who as secretary of state has presided over elections in New Hampshire since 1976, told the Guardian he was confident that there would be no repeat of last week\u2019s fiasco in Iowa - not least because New Hampshire has kept things old school, relying on paper ballots. \u201cYou can\u2019t hack a pencil,\u201d he said. Voters \u201cmake their mark on the ballot. They know what the mark is and if there\u2019s a recount they can see their mark there.\u201d He spoke as he toured the state\u2019s polling places, visiting the small town of Windsor, home to just 110 registered voters - and where the same wooden ballot box has been in continuous use since 1892, a state record. Among those voting in Windsor was retired college professor and Korea war veteran Jack Steeves. He cast his vote in the Republican primary, not for Donald Trump but by writing in the name of Mitt Romney - as a protest against the president. \u201cI would never vote for this president,\u201d Steeves said. \u201cHe\u2019s a bad man. I have three daughters and eight grand daughters: I wouldn\u2019t want him anywhere near them.\u201d His wife, Pat, a retired dental nurse, voted in the Democratic contest - and for Pete Buttigieg. \u201cI think we need someone younger and more presidential.\u201d Long way to go yet and anything might happen but with Bernie Sanders looking strong in New Hampshire the Democratic party is in a face-to-face encounter with the prospect of its presidential nomination going to a politician not well trusted or liked in the party establishment. \u201cI have a lot of faith in this party,\u201d Senate Democratic stalwart Dick Durbin tells CNN: Here\u2019s a statement from the Biden camp via @danielstrauss4: Jill and Joe Biden to Travel to South Carolina, Join Cedric Richmond for Launch Party This evening, on Tuesday, February 11, Jill and Joe Biden will travel to Columbia, South Carolina and join Campaign Co-Chair and Congressman Cedric Richmond of Louisiana for a South Carolina launch party. Later this evening, Jill and Joe Biden will address their New Hampshire supporters via livestream while Valerie Biden Owens will thank supporters in person for the hard work they poured into the campaign. \u201cI have enjoyed traveling across New Hampshire, speaking to countless Granite Staters who understand we are in a battle for the soul of this nation and I have relished fighting for each and every one of their votes\u201d said Vice President Joe Biden. \u201cI am looking forward to traveling to South Carolina this evening and Nevada later this week to carry our campaign forward and hear from the diverse voters whose voices must be heard in this process to select the Democratic nominee who will unite this country to defeat Donald Trump.\u201d Joe Biden is pulling up his stakes from New Hampshire and heading tonight to South Carolina, he has told supporters. \u201cMy message is that I\u2019ve got to get to South Carolina,\u201d Biden told reporters. After a fourth-place finish in Iowa, Biden has been polling behind his rivals in the Granite State and is banking on strong showing in the next two races, in South Carolina and Nevada, to show some viability before the Super Tuesday races. He has told supporters that he\u2019s in the race for the long haul. Donald Trump deleted his first tweet accusing Michael Bloomberg of being \u201cracist\u201d \u2013 see post at 9.03am US ET \u2013 but he\u2019s duly gone there again, this time wrapped in a jacket of puerile golf-based abuse: It\u2019s usually worth looking at the accounts the president chooses to retweet. In this case, it\u2019s Samuel Finkelstein, aka @CancelSam, \u201ca political activist, writer, and student at Seton Hall Law School\u201d who wanted this to happen: In short recap, the #BloombergIsRacist hashtag refers to video from 2015 now circulating online in which the former New York City mayor discusses in stark terms the stop-and-frisk policy he pursued in office which critics say was racist. The Aspen Times reported then that Bloomberg asked that the footage not be released. Thanks to a podcaster, it is now loose. Bloomberg is rising in polls regarding the Democratic presidential nomination and in support among African American voters. He has apologised for stop-and-frisk: Trump has an extensive record of racially charged remarks and behaviour: Trump\u2019s tweet also revisits abuse of the former mayor regarding both his physical and political stature. Responding to such an attack earlier this month, Bloomberg said he stood \u201ctwice as tall as he does on the stage that matters\u201d and added: \u201cThis is what happens when someone like me rises in the polls. All of a sudden the other candidates get scared and I think Donald Trump knows that I can beat him.\u201d Bloomberg, 77, is 5ft 8in tall. Trump, 73, is 6ft 3in. While much of the focus in New Hampshire has been the growing tension between the field\u2019s two leading candidates \u2013 Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg \u2013 and the falling fortunes of the national frontrunner Joe Biden, the state is also critically important for Elizabeth Warren. New Hampshire, which neighbors Massachusetts, was once a must-win for the senator. But now she is scrambling for third place with Biden and Amy Klobuchar. Recent polling has showed her falling behind Sanders, Buttigieg and Klobuchar in the final days before the primary here. Her path forward is equally tricky, with polling placing her somewhere in the middle in the next two states: Nevada and South Carolina. Warren has told reporters in recent days that she has an organization built to go the distance. She has staff in 30 states and has already made visits to many of the Super Tuesday states all while insisting that she doesn\u2019t need to make any consequential changes to her campaign. But the question remains: how far she can go without actually winning? Today\u2019s New Hampshire primary is the first test of a controversial new law that requires anyone who votes with an out-of-state license, and intends to drive, to get a New Hampshire license within 60 days. Voting groups say this is a poll tax on college students, Sam Levine writes: From Sam\u2019s piece: Maggie Flaherty grew up in a small town in California, but after she moved to New Hampshire to attend Dartmouth College, she registered to vote in the state where she would be spending at least four years. Now she is embroiled in a fight against Republicans in the state that is being watched across the country. Flaherty and a fellow student are challenging a Republican-backed law that is making it harder for many out-of-state students and other temporary residents to cast a ballot in a state with outsized national influence. The lawsuit has been endorsed by the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren and other Democratic presidential hopefuls. But last week, Flaherty and her colleague Caroline Casey hit another obstacle when the US district judge Joseph LaPlante denied a request to block the law just months before the primary elections. New Hampshire is a small swing state where both local and state-wide races can be decided by razor-thin margins. Donald Trump lost the state to Hillary Clinton by just 2,736 votes in 2016. The same year, Maggie Hassan, also a Democrat, defeated Kelly Ayotte for a Senate seat by just 1,017 votes. The Democratic primary in February and general election in November are expected to be closely fought. Republicans in the state have complained about college students voting before. \u201cThey are kids voting liberal, voting their feelings, with no life experience,\u201d William O\u2019Brien, a Republican and then the New Hampshire house speaker, said in 2011. There are nationwide efforts to restrict the surging student vote, but the party says the new law is merely intended to bring New Hampshire in line with other states. The law, which went into effect on 1 July, mandates that anyone who has registered to vote and intends to drive while living in the state must obtain a New Hampshire driver\u2019s license and register their vehicle within 60 days of signing up. An emboldened Donald Trump celebrated his acquittal in the Senate impeachment trial at a campaign rally in New Hampshire, where he hoped his presence would rattle his Democratic opponents on the eve of the state\u2019s first-in-the-nation primaries. While the Democratic candidates tore into the president at rallies and events across the battleground state, Trump fired up thousands of his most ardent supporters at the Monday night rally, his first since the Senate cleared him of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. \u201cOur good Republicans in the United States Senate voted to reject the outrageous partisan impeachment hoax and to issue a full, complete and absolute total acquittal,\u201d Trump thundered to a packed arena in downtown Manchester. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t even close!\u201d Trump tweeted ahead of the rally that he hoped to \u201cshake up the Dems a little bit\u201d as they face a competitive contest, in which Vermont senator Bernie Sanders leads the field in many surveys. The New Hampshire primary has always played an outsized role in the presidential nomination process, but it has taken on a heightened significance following the disastrous failureof the Iowa caucuses to produce a clear winner. Trump delighted in the debacle, playfully asking the crowd if anyone knew who had won the Democratic caucuses. \u201c(\u201cNobody knows. Flip a coin!\u201d he said.) He added later: \u201cThe Democrat party wants to run your healthcare but they can\u2019t even run a caucus in Iowa.\u201d As the Democratic hopefuls crisscrossed the state, Trump supporters came from across the region, braving rain and snow, to attend the rally in Manchester, a one-time manufacturing city of 110,000 people. The line to enter the arena snaked around the arena for several blocks; those at the front had arrived more than 24 hours in advance. Inside the arena, concession stands sold cotton candy, popcorn and Dippin\u2019 Dots to people in red Make America Great Again hats and pink Women for Trump T-shirts. Hundreds of thousands of Democratic voters are expected to cast their ballots in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday for the presidential candidate they would like to see take on Donald Trump in November\u2019s election. The primary comes just over a week after the Iowa Democratic caucuses, which ended in chaos over the reporting of the results, and where no clear single victor has been officially declared. After more than a year of campaigning, hundreds of events and millions of dollars spent, recent polling has shown the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders with a high single-digit lead over the rest of the field, with the former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg only a few points behind. Meanwhile, after her strong performance at a televised debate on Friday, two polls have found the Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar surging to third place. Klobuchar\u2019s ascent in recent Emerson and Suffolk polls shows that the primary contest is still taking shape. More than a dozen candidates are competing in the Democratic contest, and turnout is expected to be slightly higher than in 2016. The New Hampshiresecretary of state, Bill Gardner, predicted about 292,000 Democrats would come out to vote, compared with about 287,000 Democrats four years ago. Gardner also predicted about 128,000 Republicans would participate in their party\u2019s primary on Tuesday, down from 2016, when there was a heated presidential primary contest. Trump does not face any serious opposition in New Hampshire\u2019s Republican primary. Most polls close at 7pm ET, though some will stay open as late as 8pm, and results are expected soon after that. Read the full piece: After the shock of the Iowa caucus debacle eight days ago, New Hampshirecould deliver a surprise of its own, with the previously unheralded Amy Klobuchar making a late surge as the state votes in Tuesday\u2019s Democratic primary. Klobuchar has been often relegated to an afterthought in discussions about the likely presidential nominee, yet two polls on Monday showed her running third in New Hampshire \u2013 ahead of supposed top-tier candidates Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren. It would represent a remarkable turnaround for Klobuchar, who came an expectedly distant fifth in Iowa. The Minnesota senator had all but vanished from public view as the media focussed on the travails of Biden, the freshness of Pete Buttigieg and the liberalism of Bernie Sanders and Warren. But Klobuchar has been a consistently strong presence in the Democratic debates and it seems her gloves-off performance in Friday night\u2019s latest installment \u2013 when she dismissed Buttigieg as a \u201ccool newcomer\u201d who would rather watch cartoons than sit through Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment g trial \u2013 has had an immediate impact on voters. \u201cShe did a great debate on Friday night, I thought that was really good,\u201d said Jean Shiner, one of more than a thousand people who attended a Klobuchar rally in Exeter, New Hampshire, on Monday afternoon. \u201cI\u2019ve been undecided, I was leaning towards her, but now I\u2019m gonna vote for her. She has as good a chance as Biden or anybody of them of standing up to Trump. \u201cShe can really stand up for herself.\u201d Read the full piece here: It\u2019s primary day in New Hampshire \u2013 and Senator Warren shows how it\u2019s done: Pete Buttigieg: I also have donuts! Family vote outing: More family voting: In a tweet \u2013 which was then deleted \u2013 Donald Trump has called Michael Bloomberg a \u201ctotal racist\u201d. The tweet carried a video of the former New York mayor speaking at the Aspen Institute in 2015, about the controversial \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d policing policy he pursued in his time in City Hall. In the clip, which is spreading rapidly across social media, Bloomberg says police target minority neighbourhoods \u201cbecause that\u2019s where all the crime is\u201d. 95% of your murders \u2013 murderers and murder victims \u2013 fit one MO,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can just take the description, Xerox it and pass it out to all the cops. They are male, minorities, 16 to 25. That\u2019s true in New York, that\u2019s true in virtually every city. In 2015, the Aspen Times reported that Bloomberg\u2019s representatives \u201casked the Aspen Institute not to distribute footage of his recent appearance in Aspen, where the three-term New York City mayor made pointed comments concerning minorities and gun control\u201d. The video tweeted by Trump was released by a podcaster, Benjamin Dixon. At an African American church in Brooklyn in November, Bloomberg apologised for the policy: \u201cI can\u2019t change history,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever today, I want you to know that I realise back then I was wrong.\u201d With a personal fortune reckoned to be around $60bn, the former mayor is now running for the Democratic nomination to face Trump in November. He is self-funding his campaign and not competing in the early Democratic primaries. Amid a blitz of TV advertising, his poll numbers have begun to improve \u2013 notably so with African American voters, a key Democratic constituency generally thought to tilt heavily for former vice-president Joe Biden. Bloomberg\u2019s increasing prominence in the campaign has been reported to have gained Trump\u2019s attention. Trump\u2019s own record on matters pertaining to race is controversial to say the least, from his record as a property developer in New York to his comments during his run for the White House to his tweets and attacks in office: Donald Trump has denounced prosecutors\u2019 recommendation of a seven- to nine-year prison sentence for his former aide Roger Stone, reports Martin Pengelly, tweeting: \u201cCannot allow this miscarriage of justice!\u201d In November, Stone was found guilty of lying to Congress, thereby obstructing the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, and tampering with a witness in his efforts to learn about emails hacked from Democratic sources. On Monday, federal prosecutors said a seven- to nine-year sentence would \u201caccurately reflect the seriousness of his crimes and promote respect for the law\u201d. Trump disagreed, writing: \u201cThis is a horrible and very unfair situation. The real crimes were on the other side, as nothing happens to them. Cannot allow this miscarriage of justice!\u201d Read more here: Some wondered whether Donald Trump had understood the joke when he tweeted out a clip from a recent episode of Curb your Enthusiasm. In the episode, star Larry David \u2013 who plays Bernie Sanders on Saturday Night Live and not a Trump fan \u2013 wears a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat as a \u201cgreat people repellent\u201d among his liberal Los Angeles peers. It gets him out of an unwanted lunch with Somebody Feed Phil\u2019s Philip Rosenthal, and means he gets a counter to himself at a sushi place. The hat also gets him out of a scrape. In the clip Trump tweeted \u2013 seemingly recorded by someone holding their phone up in front of the TV \u2013 Larry almost drives into a biker, who threatens to \u201crip you out of that fucking car\u201d. Larry apologises profusely, but it\u2019s only when he puts his Maga hat on that peace is restored. \u201cJust be more careful next time,\u201d the biker tells him indulgently, his mood thawing instantly when he sees the cap. \u201cTOUGH GUYS FOR TRUMP!\u201d was the message the president took from the sequence. Perhaps Trump didn\u2019t get the joke. But his tweet also demonstrates the president\u2019s judo-like ability to use his opponents\u2019 criticisms against them, and to stomp over the original meanings of pop culture references such as Game of Thrones and the Avengers in order to use them for his own ends. He presumes that all his supporters will see in the clip is a tough-looking biker who backs Trump, and, if they do, perhaps that\u2019s a win for him. Joe Biden has disappointed some supporters who hoped he would come out swinging following his poor showing in Iowa last week. \u201cThis is a long race and I took a hit in Iowa and I\u2019ll probably take a hit here,\u201d he said during Friday\u2019s debate in Manchester, New Hampshire, a comment seen by some as defeatist. Last night he also sounded somewhat equivocal when asked if his campaign could survive coming fourth in New Hampshire tonight. \u201cSure I could,\u201d he told NBC. \u201cThe path is South Carolina and going into Nevada and going into Super Tuesday, and going in to states that I\u2019m going to do very well in.\u201d Asked whether his case that he was the most electable candidate was suffering, he said: \u201cI\u2019m going down to two very diverse states next, and I expect to do very well there. And still nationally, I\u2019m still leading in all polls that I\u2019m aware of, No 1. No 2, the endorsements keep coming in.\u201d Biden is in fact now neck and neck with Bernie Sanders in national polling, and in yesterday\u2019s Quinnipiac poll, the Vermont socialist was close behind him on the question of who would have the best chance of beating Donald Trump, with 24% to Biden\u2019s 27%. Pete Buttigieg also spoke to NBC last night. Asked if he was going to win in New Hampshire, he said: \u201cI think we\u2019re going to have a great night. Look we are competing against home region competition, two New England senators [Sanders and Elizabeth Warren], I recognise that, but I still think we\u2019re going to have a great night.\u201d He hit out at both Sanders and Biden, saying of the socialist senator: \u201cWhen you look at what he\u2019s proposing in terms of the budget all the things he\u2019s put forward and how to pay for them, there\u2019s a $25tn hole in how to pay for everything that he\u2019s put forward,\u201d and of the former vice-president: \u201cIf you\u2019re out for the most years spent in the Washington establishment then of course I\u2019m not going to be your candidate. I will be the first to admit that. But I believe what Americans are looking for right now is a different perspective, to change what\u2019s going on in Washington before it\u2019s too late.\u201d Amy Klobuchar is also hoping to do well in today\u2019s primary, after a strong debate performance on Friday. \u201cThere\u2019s a bunch of people coming out, committing, that had been supporting other candidates,\u201d the centrist senator from Minnesota told reporters on Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s all over the place. It\u2019s really strange. I wish I had videos of it.\u201d Michael Bloomberg may not be running in today\u2019s New Hampshire primary, but he might end up being one of its major beneficiaries. The former New York mayor is taking a radical approach to the primaries, ignoring the first four and only entering the race on Super Tuesday. With that in mind, he has been blanketing California and other large states with advertising, spending hundreds of millions of dollars from his multibillion-dollar fortune. Bernie Sanders in particular has been outraged at this strategy, accusing the centrist former mayor of trying to \u201cbuy the presidency\u201d. Sanders has also hit out at the Democratic National Committee for changing its rules regarding who qualifies to take part in debates \u2013 a move widely seen as paving the way for Bloomberg to take the stage for the first time. The reason Bloomberg \u2013 who is running on a platform of gun control, an expansion of Medicare health coverage, and a less radical climate crisis policy than some of his rivals \u2013 has not qualified for debates so far is because the old rules required candidates to have taken in a certain amount in donations, and the billionaire Bloomberg is funding his campaign himself. The former mayor\u2019s defence is basically that needs must. \u201cSomeone said: \u2018Are you spending too much money?\u2019 and I said: \u2018I\u2019m spending money to get rid of Donald Trump,\u2019\u201d he said recently. \u201cAnd the guy said: \u2018Spend more.\u2019\u201d His strategy is bound to provide fodder for political-science exam questions for years to come, and so far it seems to be bearing fruit. He has risen to almost 13% in recent polling averages, and will have been heartened by a Quinnipiac poll yesterday showing he now comes second to Joe Biden among black voters (22% to 27%). Not only has Biden\u2019s strength with African Americans been seen as one of the pillars of his claim to electability so far, but Bloomberg was seen to have a major potential problem with many black voters. While he was weighing up whether to run, he apologised for the police \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d tactic he pushed in New York that disproportionately targetted black and Latino people. \u201cI was wrong, and I am sorry,\u201d he said. The new polling figures suggest some black voters are willing to consider him despite the controversy. If Biden\u2019s candidacy implodes, he, Pete Buttigieg and to a lesser extent Amy Klobuchar will try to make the case to centrist Democrats that they can beat Bernie Sanders and then Donald Trump. But Bloomberg has a long way to go on Super Tuesday \u2013 he is still polling in single figures in California and Texas, for example, despite all his spending. Good morning and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live blog as voters in New Hampshire go to the polls in the second primary contest of the 2020 election. Results are already coming in, with three minuscule towns \u2013 Dixville Notch, Hart\u2019s Location and Millsfield \u2013 voting, as they traditionally do, just after midnight. Those results \u2013 showing Amy Klobuchar leading the Democratic pack with a total of eight votes \u2013 may not be a good prediction of the final tally, although it\u2019s true the centrist Minnesota senator was praised for her debate performance on Friday night. In fact the race for the top spot tonight is widely seen as being between leftwing senator Bernie Sanders and the centrist former mayor Pete Buttigieg. The latest polling averages show Sanders with a comfortable lead over his young rival, after the two essentially tied for first place amid the shambolic caucuses in Iowa last week. \u201cFor two people in the same party, Buttigieg and Bernie are polar opposites in many ways,\u201d Monica Klein, a progressive Democratic strategist, told my colleague Daniel Strauss. \u201cThey represent the two wings of the Democratic party \u2013 which makes Buttigieg a great contrast candidate for Bernie.\u201d Sanders beat Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire \u2013 which borders his home state of Vermont \u2013 by over 22 percentage points in 2016, and if he loses to Buttigieg tonight after his frustrating night in Iowa it may indicate his campaign is stalling. Buttigieg, meanwhile, needs a win to keep his momentum going after his unexpectedly strong showing last week \u2013 it still hasn\u2019t been formally declared a victory by results gurus AP \u2013 and a bump in his poll ratings in New Hampshire and (slightly) nationally. From here the contest enters much tougher territory for him. Nevada on 22 February looks like a close fight between Sanders and Joe Biden, and Barack Obama\u2019s former vice-president is still way ahead in South Carolina. Biden has seen his frontrunner status more or less disappear since his fourth-place finish in Iowa. Sanders is now neck and neck with him nationally, and a similarly weak showing in New Hampshire tonight may see him lose further centrist support to Buttigieg and ex-New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, the dark horse who joins the race on \u201cSuper Tuesday\u201d, 3 March, when numerous states including California, Texas and Massachusetts all vote. Adam Gabbatt examines Biden\u2019s New Hampshire campaign here. Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren \u2013 Sanders\u2019 main rival on the left \u2013 may also start to see her campaign slipping away if she fails to make an impact tonight. The Republicans are also holding a primary today, although there is only one serious candidate. Donald Trump held a rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, last night which aimed more to rattle his Democratic opponents than the relative small fry running against him in his own party. As Lauren Gambino reports, Trump attacked \u201cthe outrageous partisan impeachment hoax\u201d, revelled in the Democrats\u2019 muddled result in Iowa, and raised the prospect of his supporters influencing the Democratic result in New Hampshire by voting for the candidate they believe Trump would have the best chance of defeating. New Hampshire election laws allow independents to cast ballots for either Democrats or Republicans. \u201cMy only problem is I\u2019m trying to figure out who is the weakest candidate,\u201d the president said. \u201cI think they\u2019re all weak.\u201d We\u2019ll be covering all this and more here today, as well as news back in Washington as the House Republican leadership and the Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer both hold press conferences."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
