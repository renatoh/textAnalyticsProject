No less than 22 horses were declared yesterday for the Group One Queen Elizabeth II Stakes over a mile on Saturday, and almost a third of those are winners at the highest level already. With four of those being Classic winners either this season or last, and other performers of Group One level including Norse Dancer, Diamond Green and Antonius Pius among the possible runners, it was no surprise that Coral felt obliged yesterday to ease Soviet Song, the ante-post favourite for the race. From 2-1, James Fanshawe's filly is now 3-1 and the overall strength of the field is such that Attraction, the brilliant winner of the 1,000 Guineas in May, can be backed at 10-1 with Coral. Newmarket's other Guineas winner, Haafhd, is only a point shorter at 9-1 with Ladbrokes, while Refuse To Bend, who won the same Classic last season, is 7-1 with Coral. There is even a dark horse to add spice to the mix in the shape of Aidan O'Brien's Ace, a three-year-old son of Danehill who made a successful racecourse debut in June and has won both his races since. O'Brien is still looking for his first Group One win in Britain this season, but he nominated the QEII as Ace's next assignment as soon as he won a Group Three at Leopardstown last month, and such is the respect for any runner from Ballydoyle that he is as short as 10-1 with Hill's. Even by the considerable standards of the QEII, this renewal appears exceptional. The winner will surely be acknowledged as the best miler in Europe, and quite possibly the finest at any distance. The bookmakers cannot be faulted, though, in making Soviet Song their favourite for the race. \"Soviet Song has come out of her win in the Matron Stakes [in Ireland, beating Attraction] in very good order,\" James Fanshawe, the filly's trainer, said yesterday. \"The aim has always been to go for this race, and the only reason she wouldn't go to Ascot would be if I wasn't happy with her closer to the date. \"It looks a tough field, but she has done everything right in her last three races, and ran very well when she was second in the Queen Anne [over the straight mile at Ascot]. \"The only thing you have to hope for with so many runners, especially going around the bend at Ascot, is that you'll have some luck in running.\" The seven-strong contingent of Group One winners in Saturday's entries is completed by Rakti, who won the Prince of Wales's Stakes in June, Bachelor Duke, who took the Irish 2,000 Guineas in May, and Le Vei Dei Colori who, like last year's winner Falbrav, is a winner at the top level in Italy. The stop after Ascot in the autumn cycle of championship races is Longchamp the following weekend, when North Light, the Derby winner, seems increasingly likely to start favourite for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Sir Michael Stoute's colt has not seen a racecourse since his second to Grey Swallow in the Irish Derby in June, but he will make the short trip to the Rowley Mile in Newmarket this afternoon to gallop between the second and third races on the card. He is expected to work over nine furlongs, and an acceptable display will fuel the gamble that has seen him backed down to 4-1 favourite for the Arc with Ladbrokes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
