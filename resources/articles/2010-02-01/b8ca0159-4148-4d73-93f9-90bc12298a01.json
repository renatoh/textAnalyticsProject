Painfully out-scrummaged by Newcastle, the Exiles' forwards, led by Steffon Armitage after he was released by England, manufactured two first-half tries and then defended magnificently. If at times in the second half they appeared to push the borders of legality to their limits, a draw was the least they deserved. Newcastle's pack has very much been their strength recently, and the concerted drive exerted by the Falcons' forwards in the first two scrums was impressive. Less impressive was Newcastle fly-half Jimmy Gopperth, who missed two kickable penalties before the Irish pack strung together a series of powerful drives that resulted in George Stowers and then Armitage scoring from close range. Tom Homer converted the second, but Gopperth found his range shortly before and then after half-time to pull Newcastle level. With the ball in hand, however, the New Zealander was a liability, and despite their dominance of possession and territory, the Falcons never looked capable of finding a way through. Remarkably, this was their fourth home draw this season. \"We've got to learn to nail these sort of games,\" said Newcastle's director of rugby Steve Bates.
