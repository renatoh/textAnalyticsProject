Videotape co-ordinator Neil Housley and his production team are responsible for each and every replay, and his knowledge of the game is held in high esteem by Setanta's 110 outside-broadcast staff. Key to Housley's role is having what Setanta's head of football, Andrew Hornett, describes as a \"telepathic link\" with his co-commentator, Chris Waddle. Sharing an extrasensory perception with a wizard of White Hart Lane? Not bad for a non-league journeyman whose peripatetic career was played out in places such as Yeovil, Weymouth, Dorchester and Chelmsford. Like Waddle, pundit and co-commentator Craig Burley is feted more than Housley but he is aware that he, Waddle and Steve McManaman are the besuited tip of the iceberg. \"If you're doing this full-time you have got to understand how these guys do their jobs. There are a lot of people working in production and for you to do your job they have to do their job,\" Burley says. \"They might not be on the same salary, they may not be on the TV, but they still have a very important job.\" The duck analogy pops up several times throughout the day \u2013 everything appears serene above the surface, but underneath the Setanta water bird is kicking like crazy. At the 12pm production meeting, four hours before the broadcast begins, producer Stephen Cook talks the team through a 22-page running order that breaks down the 240-minute broadcast by the second \u2013 for all the good it does. \"These things are a work of fiction as much as anything else,\" Cook tells me later, as he fingers one of the documents, neatly ruled and colour-coded, like an anal GCSE student's study notes. \"They're a decent guide, but that's all they are.\" Setanta was a mythical character renowned for his prowess with a hurl and sliotar (hurling ball) in pagan Ireland. If Setanta the broadcaster worships any god, it is that of time. Indeed, Cook's lack of faith in the running order was vindicated in the first half-hour of the broadcast. \"Are we way over?\" he asks Rachel Clarke, script supervisor and clock-watcher. \"Yes, indeedy,\" is her chirpy response. Waddle is jettisoned from reporter Dan Roan's team-news slot as a matter of expediency. Cook and the presentation director, Simon Dukes, concoct this time-saving scheme during the ad break. No panic, no histrionics \u2013 everyone is relaxed enough, for example, to take the piss out of some poor acting in one of the commercials. Team spirit and the creation of a fun working environment are the dominant themes of Hornett's management-speak spiel on the completion of my tour of the three trucks and two smaller vans that house Setanta's production staff. Statistician David Todd has always loved football and is now in his \"dream job\". Sound supervisor Mark Cattell assures me, with a smile, that he does do \"some work\". Production manager Josie Cornes works Monday to Friday but volunteered to be at Vicarage Road. Simon and Dave, in the creative production van, beam when Hornett jokingly dismisses their editing as \"namby-pamby nonsense\". Runners Katherine York and David Kane stand proudly on the lowest rung of the ladder. Near the top, Cook says: \"I knew I wanted to do this job before I even went to university.\" It was all quite sickening, to be honest with you. It was these human beings, rather than the hi-tech and ludicrously expensive equipment they operated, that resonated. Operating the \"personality camera\" on the halfway line (one of 18 cameras trained on the Vicarage Road pitch) is George Gardiner. He is not saying how long he has been a cameraman but he did divulge that his first career choice was accountancy, his traineeship coming to an end when he was caught drawing cartoons of his boss. Needless to say, he enjoys capturing sporting action more than he enjoyed counting beans, though he says Wimbledon is a bit boring. Football is the sport, but, as a cameraman, the game is trying to get your angle chosen by the director. \"You nick as much off the other guys as possible,\" Gardiner tells me. \"It's a competition, isn't it? If the little red light comes on it's like, 'Yeah'.\" The man who dictates which red light illuminates is Rob Levi, the match director. Unsurprisingly, the lifelong West Ham fan is also doing the job he loves, an asset, he says, that is vital to getting it right. \"I'm a fanatical fan,\" he enthuses. \"I've always watched lots of football on TV. You just get a feel for it, you just know.\" He sells himself short: I watch lots of football on TV, too, but I would struggle to do his job. As well as deciding the angle, he cues up the next cameraman, prompts him on what he should train his camera on, and decrees when the replays are rolled, when the statistics graphics drop down, when the managers and referee are introduced, and when the commentator promotes the next live offering. \"The most important thing is you're live on the pitch \u2013 you let the viewers see what they want to see,\" he tells me. \"You don't put in lots of replays, unnecessary replays, you don't want to show lots of faces in the crowd. The worst thing is when you're watching a replay and you hear a roar, you're thinking, 'What's going on?' You can't see it. So I just try and keep it simple and just show the game.\" Camera one, on the gantry above the halfway line, is always on the ball and is the camera most frequently used. Choosing when to deviate is Levi's key role \u2013 he changes camera at the touch of a button but he never does so without letting the cameramen know, via his headset, that he is about to do it. A pattern emerges. The live action of a shot by Didier Drogba is shown through camera one. When the keeper saves, and the ball goes out of play, Levi switches to cameras two or three, which will be on Drogba, camera four will be on the secondary player \u2013 either the goalkeeper or whoever passed to Drogba \u2013 but normally the camera will linger on Drogba for a moment before Levi cues a replay prepared by Housley on either Line A, B, C or D. A lifelong question of mine was answered by Mark on camera five. During the second half he lingered on an attractive blonde in the crowd for at least five minutes. Levi didn't cut to him, but neither did he give him a different brief. So, there you have it: those shots of sexy ladies in the crowd during matches are the result of patient yet innocent perving. I had to know. One of the cameras was trained on Guus Hiddink and Roman Abramovich, in the directors' box, for the duration. Levi says his coverage is influenced by what he imagines the headlines will be the next day; he and the Setanta team identified the presence of Chelsea's new manager and the club's owner as at least as newsworthy as any result. It is interesting that Levi should afford the print media's reaction such primacy, as it indicates a symbiotic relationship between newspapers and television that is less likely to be acknowledged by the press. Yet our news lists are frequently affected by television coverage \u2013 a different camera angle of an incident; something picked up on a pitchside microphone; a sending-off replayed ad nauseam; even moments such as Tic-Tacgate, when ITV accidentally cut to an ad break and missed Everton's 118th-minute winner against Liverpool. Setanta have been generating unwelcome headlines of their own recently. Their failure to secure more than one Premier League rights package has led some commentators to question the company's viability. Setanta's PR man requested I not mention the elephant in the room, and I was good to my word, mainly because others mentioned it to me. One member of staff, on hearing that I was from the Guardian, asked me if this article would be appearing with our poll. I didn't twig what he was getting at until he explained to someone else that Thursday's poll asked our readers, \"Would you subscribe to Setanta in 2010?\" He turned to me and spat, \"Thanks for that\". Well, the public have spoken, and 73% of those who responded said that they would subscribe to Setanta in 2010. I got the feeling that nobody who works at the broadcaster takes his or her position for granted. Smoking a cigarette on the steps of the presentation truck with Hornett (incidentally, in a previous job Hornett dreamed up the idea of plonking Matt Le Tissier in front of a monitor on Soccer Saturday, so the next time you find yourself wondering why you're watching people watching football, you can blame him), I said that the view of the Vicarage Road End goalmouth we had over the wall wasn't bad for nothing. \"It's not free,\" he replied. \"It cost about \u00a3150m.\" Even for McManaman, who certainly doesn't rely on his pay cheque as a Setanta pundit, the satisfaction garnered from a job well done seems priceless. \"The people are the same people you see every week,\" he says. \"It's great to get back what you lose when you stop playing football \u2013 that camaraderie and the same group of players.\" It is this enthusiasm \u2013 and mountains of chocolate, cakes and crisps \u2013 that keeps the staff going through their nine-hour day. I ask Housley how producing replays compares to playing the game. \"It's the next best thing,\" he replies, and I believe him.
