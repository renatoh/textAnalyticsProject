Dan Colson, the deputy chairman and chief executive of Mr Black's Hollinger group, which also owns the Chicago Sun Times, confirmed the company was backing the planned launch. \"Hollinger, together with a bunch of investors, is looking at the idea of launching a paper in New York in the first quarter of next year,\" Mr Colson confirmed. But he was keen to play down the size of the launch and Hollinger's role in it, saying it was \"not a big ticket\". Mr Colson described the planned title as an \"upmarket, neo-Conservative paper that would deal exclusively with New York news, politics and the arts\". But he explicitly ruled out a head-to-head battle with the heavyweight market leader. \"This is not a rival to the New York Times,\" he said. Hollinger is a minority shareholder in the group of investors, which include Roger Hertog, the chairman of the investment bank, Sanford Bernstein. Hollinger is to contribute a 12.5% stake - which Mr Colson valued at about $2m - to the launch. The paper will be edited by Seth Lipsky, a veteran New York journalist who covered the war in Vietnam. Lipsky was among the founding staff of the Asian Wall Street Journal and the conservative magazine, Forward. He is married to the right-wing journalist, Amity Shlaes, a former Wall Street Journal columnist who now writes for the Financial Times in London. Keith Kelly, a media correspondent on the New York Post, said he was not surprised to learn Mr Black was about to gain a foothold in the New York market. \"Black has always been interested in New York,\" said Kelly, \"but to do it in this environment seems suicidal.\" Mr Black's involvement puts paid to suggestions he has lost interest in publishing following the sale of his Canadian newspaper, the National Post."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
