Well, almost everybody", "bodyText": "John McEnroe\u2019s father, finding himself powerless to curb his son\u2019s temper, at least prevailed upon him never to swear on court. That advice, McEnroe explained, produced those violent, weirdly prim outbursts that always made him sound like a supply teacher in meltdown: \u201cYou canNOT be serious!\u201d It is clear from the start of John McEnroe: Still Rockin\u2019 at 60 (BBC One) that this line still haunts the three-time Wimbledon singles champion. It is also clear that he doesn\u2019t really mind. He repeats it himself, often, whenever he thinks it will serve as a punchline. On the eve of Wimbledon fortnight, Sue Barker went to meet one of the tournament\u2019s best-loved \u2013 in retrospect, at least \u2013 players, to let him reminisce about his life and career. It is not quite a hagiography \u2013 you would be hard-pressed to make McEnroe look like a saint \u2013 but it is still a bit of a victory lap, for a man who appears in every respect to deserve one. McEnroe grew up in Douglaston, an upmarket bit of Queens that happened to have its own tennis club, of which he was the undisputed star. He was 18, and still an amateur, when on a whim he and Mary Carillo, a friend from Douglaston, entered the French Open mixed doubles. They won the title. That summer, he reached the Wimbledon singles semi-finals. Back then, he looked like a child actor hired to play a tennis brat: knit brows, pouting lower lip, wild curls pinched in a headband. Although he was vilified for the outbursts he directed at officials, he remained at all times unapologetic. \u201cWhen people look back in 10 years, they\u2019re gonna thank me for improving the level of officiating,\u201d he says. Reflecting on those days, a white-haired McEnroe recalls the pressure he was under from his parents, who expected only the best from him. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult when you feel like, no matter what you do, it\u2019s not enough,\u201d he says. His behaviour left him isolated in the tour changing rooms, but even now he maintains he was always right about the bad calls. Eventually, he earned enough respect from rivals such as Bj\u00f6rn Borg to gain acceptance, and he settled down enough to enjoy an era where professional players could still combine world-class tennis with a rock\u2019n\u2019roll lifestyle. \u201cIn our day, we took performance-detracting drugs,\u201d he says. It is difficult to pinpoint the moment when McEnroe was transformed from reviled tantrum-thrower to imported national treasure. It is as if one day he went into the wilderness and returned with a sense of humour about everything. He is as brash and unapologetic as he ever was, but there is a gentle self-mockery behind it all, not to mention a great deal of insight. It is almost impossible not to like him. Today, he is a man of varied and competing passions. He takes Barker to his New York art gallery, where he fishes through a deep, dark cupboard in search of a ladder. \u201cThis is where the Warhol of me and my ex-wife resides,\u201d he says. He still maintains his lifelong love affair with rock\u2019n\u2019roll, although it would be hard to find charitable things to say about his singing. One of his daughters insists he was a pretty good guitar player, but the BBC is not able to provide any evidence of this. McEnroe at 60, although reflective, is hardly a man on the brink of retirement: he is a full-time tennis commentator when he is not running his New York tennis academy. And he still plays the game \u2013 the oldest guy on the senior tour, and possibly the fittest. Above all, McEnroe comes across as a man sustained by relationships, with family, friends, partners and rivals. They are all here, armed with anecdotes: Borg, Chrissie Hynde (\u201cWhen he would come to London, he\u2019d always give me a call,\u201d she says. \u201cI knew it\u2019s \u2019cos he thought I might have some pot\u201d), his wife of 25 years, his kids, his two brothers. Everybody, it seems, has a good word to say about him. The exception, perhaps, is arch-rival Jimmy Connors, very much the Sir Not-Appearing-In-This-Film of the evening. But, in his absence, we get McEnroe on Connors: \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s another player on Earth I have more respect for, in terms of what he brought to the table,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s also one of the biggest A-holes that ever lived. But so am I.\u201d Careful not to swear, as ever."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
