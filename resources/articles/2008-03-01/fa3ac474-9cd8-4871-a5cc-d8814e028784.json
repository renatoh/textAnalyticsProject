Rangers, in Bremen for tonight's Uefa Cup tie, sit three points in front of Celtic at the summit of the Premier League, and with a game in hand, after Gordon Strachan's men failed to break down Dundee United last night. It is matches like these which can and will decide championships. United would have been forgiven for regarding this match as an inconvenience, despite their ongoing chase for a European place in the SPL, given that they will face Rangers in the CIS Cup final on Sunday. Wandering minds and six changes to the starting XI, therefore, were perhaps responsible for a lethargic start from the visitors, Shunsuke Nakamura coming within the width of a post of sending Celtic in front within three minutes. Scott McDonald was the next to hit the woodwork, the Celtic striker rounding off the finest move of the opening period, which also included Georgios Samaras and Scott Brown. Yet United proved increasingly dangerous on the counter as the half wore on, the pace of Prince Buaben and Craig Conway posing a series of problems to the Celtic backline. Conway, in fact, passed up a glorious opportunity to send his team in front, heading over from six yards just five minutes from the interval. Celtic heeded the warning but the closest they came to scoring was through a series of Nakamura free-kicks. Strachan called upon the services of Barry Robson and Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink and Robson soon came perilously close to conceding a penalty after blocking a Mark De Vries shot with his hand. Vennegoor of Hesselink headed Celtic's final chance over as United remained unbowed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
