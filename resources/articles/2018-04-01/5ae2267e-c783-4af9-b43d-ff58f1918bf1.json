The temptation is to assume each was discussing Manchester City after another elegant evisceration, a demonstration of how to ally class with a clinical streak, possession football with penetration. And, indeed, the beaten Everton manager was bemoaning the excellence of his conquerors. \u201cIn my long career I have found a way to frustrate a team and block them off. But with this team, whichever way you try to block them off they can get round it and through it,\u201d the arch-nullifier Allardyce said. Yet Guardiola was already casting his thoughts forward to his next visit to Merseyside. His gaze had been diverted from his own side towards their next opponents. The prospect of clinching the title against Manchester United on Saturday was not enough to hold his attention. \u201cLike a manager, now Liverpool will occupy all my head,\u201d he said. Was he, Guardiola was asked, making special provisions to stop the 37-goal Mohamed Salah? \u201cNot just him, [Sadio] Man\u00e9 and [Roberto] Firmino. All three, they are almost unstoppable,\u201d replied Guardiola. \u201cThey are fantastic players. The way Liverpool play is so complicated for us. We know that. They are so quick, they are so good and it is tough.\u201d The sense was that the planning for the Champions League quarter-final trip to Anfield on Wednesday had already begun. The sight of the world\u2019s second most expensive centre-back at left-back hinted at a bespoke ploy to stop Salah. Another of Merseyside\u2019s jet\u2011heeled right\u2011wingers, Theo Walcott, provided Aymeric Laporte with a dress rehearsal. Guardiola cited the Frenchman\u2019s minor foot injury as the only cause for concern. \u201cIt is not easy to defend against Walcott, so he did really well,\u201d the City manager said. That may have been a flattering appraisal: Laporte is not as quick as Walcott but then few are, and resorted to a blatant block once when outpaced. The \u00a357m addition was otherwise largely unchallenged as, with Walcott limited to 19 touches and Everton to a meagre 18% of possession, it felt an inconclusive audition. Yet it hinted at a game plan, with Laporte\u2019s narrow station closing the channel between centre-back and full-back where Salah tends to raid. Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi was for once positioned to Vincent Kompany\u2019s right \u2013 presumably preparing to get him away from his Egyptian tormentor \u2013 and Guardiola\u2019s lopsided shape doubled up as a flexible formation. Part right-back, part wing-back, Kyle Walker completed a defensive quartet when required but surged forward when his side had the ball. The intellectual in Guardiola has long been intrigued by how J\u00fcrgen Klopp uses congesting the centre of the pitch as a devastating attacking weapon and, just as only Liverpool\u2019s full-backs offer them any real width, Walker and Leroy San\u00e9 were in effect one-man flanks at Goodison Park. Guardiola\u2019s prolific right-winger, Raheem Sterling, played further infield than usual. If his Anfield counterpart Salah has been the scourge of left\u2011backs, Guardiola has none: not fit specialists anyhow. Laporte is the fourth makeshift, a centre\u2011back joining a central midfielder (Fabian Delph), a winger (Oleksandr Zinchenko) and a right\u2011back (Danilo) as Guardiola\u2019s resourcefulness and his players\u2019 adaptability have ensured what should \u2013 after Benjamin Mendy\u2019s knee injury in September \u2013 have become a problem position has rarely presented problems except against Liverpool. In September, even with Mendy available and raiding forward from wing\u2011back, Salah tormented the left of three centre-backs, Otamendi, before Klopp sacrificed him after Man\u00e9\u2019s red card. Few men can have performed as abjectly in a 5-0 win as the Argentinian. Delph went off injured in January\u2019s rematch. Danilo was on the pitch for Liverpool\u2019s nine-minute three-goal salvo that sealed City\u2019s sole league defeat. Scars may remain. Guardiola name-checked Liverpool\u2019s four scorers that day with an unprompted mention of the midfielder who broke the deadlock. That Kevin de Bruyne played deeper than usual on Saturday suggested he may be granted a similar role alongside Fernandinho to try and halt Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain on Wednesday. \u201cWe cannot deny [the excellence of the] three people running up front, plus [Oxlade-] Chamberlain in the middle, plus set pieces with Virgil van Dijk,\u201d said Guardiola. \u201cThey are an extraordinary team.\u201d Allardyce could adopt the role of an interested onlooker. \u201cLiverpool are the only team to beat them,\u201d he said. \u201cLiverpool on top of their game and City on top of their game is going to be a great battle.\u201d But the battle of minds may have begun on the other side of Stanley Park on Saturday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
