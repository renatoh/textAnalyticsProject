When he formed the Castiles, 50 years ago, \u201cI was considered toxic in front of a microphone,\u201d he writes. And while he reckons he\u2019s competent now, he doesn\u2019t stretch much further than that: \u201cI have a barman\u2019s power, range and durability, but I don\u2019t have a lot of tonal beauty or finesse \u2026 My voice gets the job done. But it\u2019s a journeyman\u2019s instrument and on its own, it\u2019s never going to take you to higher ground. I need all my skills to get by and to communicate deeply \u2026 I am a sum of all my parts. I learned early that this is not something to fret about.\u201d While this might not come as much of a surprise to those for whom Springsteen\u2019s full-on mode \u2013 that wounded-bullock bellow of his biggest rock song \u2013 is a stumbling block, it is still shocking to hear one of rock\u2019s most admired and longstanding stars, whose debt to soul and R&amp;B is so transparent, admit it\u2019s the case. Whatever his relationship with his dad, he was always looking for father figures Springsteen\u2019s troubled relationship with his father, eventually resolved long into adulthood, is an ongoing theme of Born to Run. In the absence of a father who supported him, he sought encouragement and advice from a series of men he admits were \u201csurrogate father figures\u201d, beginning in his teens with Tex Vinyard in his hometown of Freehold, New Jersey. Tex and his wife Marion let local teen bands practise in their home. \u201cHe was loving in his own twisted way,\u201d Springsteen writes. \u201cMore important, he was accepting. He cherished and encouraged your talents, took you for who you were and put his time, muscles, money and big black Cadillac, hauling equipment, all in service of your dreams.\u201d Those father figures crop up several times, until the most important of all arrives in Springsteen\u2019s life \u2013 Jon Landau. When the facts become legend, Springsteen prints the legend One of the key moments in Springsteen\u2019s career is one of the most misinterpreted. In May 1974, Landau \u2013 at that point a rock writer who\u2019d had an unsuccessful bash at being a producer, and who was undergoing a crisis of faith in rock music, wondering if he had a place within it \u2013 reviewed a Springsteen show in Cambridge, across the River Charles from Boston. \u201cLast Thursday, at the Harvard Square theater, I saw rock\u2019n\u2019roll past flash before my eyes,\u201d Landau wrote. \u201cAnd I saw something else: I saw rock and roll future and its name is Bruce Springsteen. And on a night when I needed to feel young, he made me feel like I was hearing music for the very first time.\u201d Landau was writing not that he had seen the future course of music, but that he had seen he and rock had a future together. The quote was transformed, until Springsteen became the subtly different \u201cthe future of rock\u2019n\u2019roll\u201d, a quote that followed him around and boosted his reputation. It was, as Springsteen writes in Born to Run, \u201cone of the greatest lifesaving raves of all time\u201d, and he acknowledges what Landau was really writing about and how \u201cit has always been taken somewhat out of context, its lovely subtleties lost\u201d. And yet, when he introduces the quote, he doesn\u2019t cite the actual words, writing instead: \u201cA man in Boston had \u2018seen the future of rock\u2019n\u2019roll\u2019, and it was \u2026 me.\u201d A small thing, but given how crucial the quote was, an important thing. Springsteen often had problems with women While he realised early on that music was a way to meet girls \u2013 that even a gawky kid could stir interest if he was willing to shake it up on the dancefloor, or hold a guitar on a stage \u2013 Springsteen was so consumed by his music that he didn\u2019t have a lot of time for women. And when he did, he says, he didn\u2019t behave well. He accepts he handled his separation from his first wife, Julianne Phillips, appallingly. But there\u2019s more to it than that, and he traces it back to the personality traits he inherited from his father: \u201cA misogyny grown from the fear of all the dangerous, beautiful, strong women in our lives crossed with the carrying of an underlying physical threat, a psychological bullying that is meant to frighten and communicate that the dark thing in you is barely restrained. You use it to intimidate those you love \u2026 I can\u2019t lay it all at my pop\u2019s feet; plenty of it is my own weakness and inability at this late date to put it all away.\u201d The E Street Band could never be simply a band of brothers Of course, Springsteen was always the boss \u2013 as well as The Boss \u2013 but there\u2019s more to it than that, and it lies in the complicated status of Clarence Clemons, saxophonist and onstage foil, the best-paid member of the band, and its beating heart. \u201cHe struggled living in the predominantly white world of our band,\u201d Springsteen writes. \u201cFor a long time he was alone, and no matter how close we were, I was white. We had as deep a relationship as I can imagine, but we lived in the real world, where we\u2019d experienced that nothing, not all the love in God\u2019s heaven, obliterates race.\u201d There\u2019s a telling moment in Born to Run, when the E Street Band join the 1988 Human Rights Now tour promoting Amnesty International. One of the stops is in Cote D\u2019Ivoire, where the band play to \u201can audience, a stadium audience, of completely black faces! I finally knew how Clarence felt.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
