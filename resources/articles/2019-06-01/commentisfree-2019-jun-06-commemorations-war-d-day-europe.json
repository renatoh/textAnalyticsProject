That is appropriate when the participants are still among us and when war\u2019s emotions are a living memory \u2013 we should thank those who fought to make us safe. Something at least can unite the British, even if it is only the past. But when the remembering is over, then what? Recalling past wars is the most dangerous thing a nation can do. Too much remembering has lain at the root of almost every conflict in Europe\u2019s history. We say we learn war\u2019s lessons, but we seldom do. Memory distorts and emotionalises history. By its nature it dwells on grievance, enmity and retribution. Why is it we all recall war but never peace? There is not the remotest danger of Britons forgetting the first or second world wars. We are addicted to them, to a degree that baffles foreigners but delights the defence lobby. The media calendar is crammed with memorial dates. Bookshop windows are piled with war books. Television schedules carry nightly reruns of battles, blood and guts. We have had D-day\u2019s 50th recall, its 60th, 65th, 70th and now its 75th. We will surely have its 80th and its 100th. The ritual will be repeated next year on VE day, as it was repeated last year in memory of 1918, with actors for soldiers. War memorials and poppy days have become part of the annual round. I refuse to decry such ceremony altogether, but it risks losing proportion and judgment. These wars pass into history under a cloak of partisanship. The BBC\u2019s reporting of Tuesday\u2019s Portsmouth ceremony implied that D-day was Britain winning the war against Hitler, and was the \u201cturning point\u201d of victory. There was little recognition of America\u2019s role, let alone of the ensuing shambles of 1944-45. As for eventual victory, it was the Russians who fought the fiercest battles, suffered the worst losses and deserve most credit for defeating Hitler. Can we not grow up and admit it? Soon the veterans will depart, and our thanks with them. At that point, these staged outpourings of nationalised grief and thanks become artificial. We do not \u201cremember\u201d Mafeking or Balaclava or Waterloo with televised tears. Critics of the BBC\u2019s hyping of the first world war were told the point was to remember its lessons. But can anyone recall what they were? We had only the vacuous cliche that it was \u201cthe war to end wars\u201d, which it most certainly was not. The lesson of that war \u2013 predicted by Lloyd George at the time \u2013 was do not punish your enemy so severely as to make another war inevitable. The crippling by the allies of Germany\u2019s economy and its emergent democracy in the 1920s was the prime cause of the second great conflagration. Hitlerism was nurtured in the bosom of the 1919 Treaty of Versailles. That lesson was learned in 1945, when Germany was helped back on its feet. But the chief motive for doing so was as a bulwark against Stalinism, with the implication that another war might soon have to be fought. The resulting cold war had an awesome cost, but it did not become a hot one. The existence of Nato and of an east-west nuclear balance of power held the parties back from the brink. For all its belligerent talk, the cold war was a time of eerie peace. Now we risk drawing the wrong lesson from D-day: that strong alliances and massive armies are vital to defend our shores and freedoms. This was true while the cold war lasted, but since then Britain\u2019s alliance with the US and membership of Nato has drawn it into a succession of failed interventions \u2013 as in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya \u2013 that have nothing to do with its national security. Proxy aggressions have killed British soldiers and cost it dear, pandering to the populist belligerence of US presidents and our own prime ministers. The only lesson from them is that Nato\u2019s utility is dwindling. It was left to Donald Trump to asks the inevitable question: why should America continue to offer Europe a nuclear shield against Russia at its own vast expense? Soviet communism is dead. Russia does not militarily threaten America any more than it threatens Britain. Yet western Europe is treating Russia much as it did Germany in the 1920s. It has pushed Nato and its nuclear shield up to Russia\u2019s borders. It imposes on it ever harsher economic sanctions. It has driven its leader, Vladimir Putin, into an autocratic redoubt from which a restless belligerence is his natural response. Do we not remember 1918? The dangers to British security now lie a thousand miles from the beaches of Normandy. They lie in digital hacking, the corrupting of democracy and the seduction of proxy wars. These dangers are not met by jet fighters or giant carriers like HMS Queen Elizabeth that muscled in on the Portsmouth celebrations. Britain is not under serious threat. Such risks as it faces demand intelligent policing rather than traditional soldiering. They need brains, not bravery. The truth is that history can be found to teach any lesson you want. But when it is fuelled by the emotions of war it is likely to teach the wrong one. Maybe the memories of past wars ought to insulate us against their repetition. But they do not. We should now put the 20th century behind us, and get stuck into the 21st. \u2022 Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
