In May I posed the question 'Can subscribing to a sports or racing tipping service ever constitute a legitimate form of investment?' to sports betting expert Trevor Oakland and Steve Lewis Hamilton, one of Britain's foremost professional backers. Since then, I've been joined by The Mathematician, aka form and stats expert Guy Ward, in a year-long experiment to test their claims. As with Steve, Guy's comprehensive daily emails are the result of 16-hour days and endless trawls through an archive of race videos, notes and formbooks. To add ballast to the experts' weighty claims, I asked former pub landlord and my own betting mentor, Eamonn 'The Amateur', to take on the pros and strike a blow for armchair punters. So, how do things stand? The answer is fantastically well. If I'd backed every tip advised with \u00a3100, I'd be sitting on a three-month profit of \u00a37,409.66. Everyone is well in profit and I've enjoyed long winning streaks, such as Sport4Profit's 12 consecutive winning rugby bets at cumulative odds of 2,195-1 and numerous placed and winning golfers at odds up to 66-1. Steve Lewis Hamilton has amassed a personal profit of \u00a33,220.83, with a steady stream of value winners such as Now Then Sid and Harrycat, both at 10-1. After a tentative start, The Mathematician has hit his stride, with winners at 7-1, 8-1, 8-1, 6-1 and 11-2 in a nine-day purple patch last month. He's earned a cumulative profit of \u00a31, 641. In the same rain-sodden 13 weeks, Eamonn has returned three winners from 17 bets and a net loss of \u00a3825. 'A Corinthian spirit and a wee bit of knowledge just can't compete,' he says. My original \u00a3200 is now a healthy \u00a3640 and my only regret is 'Why didn't I start out with \u00a35,000?' \u00b7 For a full list of weekly figures, bets struck and features on this project please contact me at greg@ProGambler.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
