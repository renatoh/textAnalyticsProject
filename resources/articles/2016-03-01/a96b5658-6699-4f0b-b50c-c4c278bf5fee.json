Rashford scored twice on his debut against Midtjylland and two more in the 3-2 win against Arsenal, yet he was given a chance only because of Anthony Martial\u2019s injury in the warm-up before the Europa League match with the Danish side. \u201cHe was training with the second team,\u201d Van Gaal said. \u201cSometimes he could play the part in 11-against-11 and then I saw him. You can see him with the second team but he was fast and playing on the right and left side. I put him in the striker\u2019s position. You never know if a player can cope with the rhythm of your team. He did it very well. \u201cThe first time it is not so difficult because the player is so focused. Now the pressure shall rise for him because all the people shall look at him in another way. After four goals, the fans are expecting the fifth. But he has certain qualities. He can score in his way and that\u2019s because he sniffs the situation in advance of other players.\u201d Rashford is a beneficiary of Van Gaal\u2019s decision not to buy a striker in January. \u201cI have not bought a striker because of Wayne Rooney and Martial, because they could play in the striker position, and because Rooney is the captain he shall always play. I don\u2019t buy a third striker, so he [Rashford] has the possibility. \u201cHe was on the bench at Watford and Leicester. He was having a very good period. He might have come in for the Watford match but we played another system and Memphis Depay and Jesse Lingard played very well. Because we have a small squad and no more than two players for one position, you can give an opportunity to a youngster.\u201d Martial has a chance of being in contention for the visit of Watford on Wednesday night and Van Gaal would not be drawn on whether Rashford would retain his place. \u201cYou have to wait and see,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I have choice enough, then I rotate. There\u2019s no player in the English Premier League who can cope with the rhythm of matches. A player like Rooney could always cope but he is injured and not for the first time. So I have to rotate. I have Rooney, I have Martial, I have Rashford, I had Will Keane but Keane is injured and will be operated on. When I have more players, I will rotate.\u201d Van Gaal dismissed suggestions Rooney needs surgery on a knee injury. \u201cNo he does not need an operation. He may be back in March,\u201d the manager said. The three consecutive victories against Shrewsbury Town, Midtjylland and Arsenal have lifted the club. \u201cI think the atmosphere is always the most important thing,\u201d Van Gaal said. \u201cIf you go to work and it is a sad atmosphere you are not going to work with your eyes open. I made some changes to the rhythm of the day to raise the atmosphere. You have to win to raise the atmosphere. We have won three times so even the media are happy. It\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d March could be a decisive month for United. After Watford, they are at West Brom on Sunday before they travel to Liverpool in the Europa League, face West Ham United in the FA Cup, host Liverpool in the return leg and then head to Manchester City for the derby. \u201cNow we are coming into the decisive moments of the competition in the league and the FA Cup,\u201d Van Gaal said. \u201cIt is important, especially from us, because we have lost too many unnecessary points. We are six behind Manchester City [fourth] and seven behind Arsenal. That is too much, so we have to win.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
