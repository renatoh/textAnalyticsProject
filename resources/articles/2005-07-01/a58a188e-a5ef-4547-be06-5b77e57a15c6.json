Join my colleague, James Dart, for coverage of tomorrow's final round. But from me it's goodnight. 7.22pm: The biggest roar of the day rolls around St Andrews as Monty makes his birdie to finish the day on -9. A great finish, which sets things up nicely for tomorrow. 7.20pm: Brilliant eagle putt from Woods, to within a foot, before he makes his birdie. Despite having two take two drops, and not playing particularly well, he finishes the day on -12, two shots clear of Olazabal. Now Monty has a 20-footer for birdie... 7.14pm: Woods sends his drive at 18 to the left of the fairway. He'll have about a 70-foot putt for eagle. Monty, meanwhile, whacks his drive even further left. 7.11pm: What a putt from Tiger! He finds the middle of the hole and does a Tim Henmanesque fist-pump to celebrate. He stays at -11, but Monty can only make birdie to drop to -8. 7.10pm: Vijay just misses his eagle putt on 18. He finishes with a 71, seven under par, and is just about it the running tomorrow. 7.09pm: Monty gets out of the bunker at his first attempt, but has a 25-footer for par. 7.08pm: Tiger elects to putt, but it's gone 10-foot past, and he's staring at another bogey. Meanwhile Brad Faxon birdies 18 to finish on -8. 7.06pm: Tiger, having found the rough with his tee shot on 17, elects to play it safe and ends up 10 feet sort of the green. He has a hazardous looking chip shot, and getting up and down won't be easy. But Monty, from a perfect lie, has found the Road Hole bunker... 7.05pm: Vijay's wild round continues: a bogey on 17 means he's back at -6, where he started (after five bogeys and five birdies). 7pm: After standing over the putt for an age, Tiger makes bogey. He's now only on -11, with Olazabal on -10, Goosen and Montgomerie on -9, and Garcia on -8. 6.57pm: Tiger's par putt falls six feet short. If he's misses this, he'll be tied with Olazabal. 6.56pm: Woods' third shot isn't very good either: it whizzes out of the rough and speeds down the hill. He'll have a 25-footer for par. 6.52pm: Olazabal's drive to the 18th falls short, and his approach isn't his best. But the Spaniard makes a very tough 15-footer for birdie to finish his day with a 68, 10 under par. 6.49pm: Woods' approach to the 16th is not a good one: he's in medium-thick rough at the back right of the green. 6.43pm: Garcia, speaking to the BBC reckons he \"did pretty well today.\" He adds: \"I'm happy that I've given myself a chance tomorrow, I enjoyed playing with the wind up. That was the real St Andrews.\" 6.37pm: Olazabal makes a brave eight-footer on the 17th to stay at -9. Meanwhile Garcia holes from a similar distance for a birdie three on 18. He finishes with a 69, eight under par. 6.34pm: Latest scoreboard: Woods -12, Goosen, Montgomerie, Olazabal -9, Campbell, Faxon (who's just birdied 16), Garcia, Singh -7. 6.29pm: And Tiger, putting for birdie from 15-feet or so, can only par the 14th too. A chance to extend his lead wasted, then, but he's still three shots ahead. 6.25pm: Something's distracted Montgomerie, who's waving his hands this way and that. He takes ages to line up a 20-foot birdie putt on the par-five 14th but only makes par. Meanwhile Brad Faxon has just bogeyed 15 to move back to -6. 6.16pm: Vijay Singh, who's had a very up-and-down round, makes birdie on 14 to move to -7. If he can pick up another couple of shots he could yet be in contention come tomorrow. 6.10pm: Woods makes a mightily tough six-footer for par to remaining on -12. Monty, from about the same distance, also holds a tricky one. However Garcia has dropped a stroke on 16 to fall to -7. 6.05pm: Garcia misses a tricky 30-footer on 16 and has a tough one for par. \"I am stuck at work here in Jersey when I should be down the beach or watching the golf, or both,\" says Dan Hare. \"Your commentary is making me slightly less annoyed with my employers. However, I cannot understand the excitement over Harry Potter VI. Has he grown pubes or something?\" 6pm: Current leaderboard - Woods -12, Montgomery, Goosen, Olazabal -9, Garcia -8, Campbell -7. 5.57pm: Birdie for Woods on 12! And, with Monty missing, the world No1 - who was looking so vulnerable - is now three shots clear. 5.53pm: Not a good eagle putt from Woods at the 12th. He's left it 10-foot short. Meanwhile Monty's chipped on and has a chance for birdie. \"Re: Steve Woodham's comments over Harry Potter. It's clearly no longer literature primarily for children, in my opinion,\" says Tom King. \"And it depends what you define as something to be proud of. Some might say that trawling the internet for golf reports when it is being broadcast on terrestrial TV might border on the pathetic, but here we all are.\" 5.48pm: Clark pars 18 to finish on -6. \"Tracey has indeed hit the nail on the head,\" says Kate Carter. \"AND I sorted out the Boggart in the cupboard.\" Answers to what she's talking about to the usual address, please. 5.45pm: The 12th hole is certainly birdieable and Woods goes for broke, missing a pot-bunker on 12 by inches. He's now just off the green, and a chip and a putt will earn him another birdie. Monty, meanwhile, is in the heather. 5.43pm: Vijay Singh is quietly creeping back into this - a birdie on 12 takes him to -7. Meanwhile Garcia birdies 14 to move to -8. 5.40pm: Monty's grimacing like he's been stung by a wasp after three-putting on 11 to fall back to -9. Tiger, meanwhile, makes another steady par. 5.36pm: After driving into a bunker at 13, Olazabal makes bogey to drop to -9. Meanwhile, Rob Hisnay wants to know whether there's \"any truth to the reports that Malcolm Glazer is at St Andrews and looking to buy it?\" Don't think he's any money left, Rob... 5.32pm: \"Yeahhhhhhhhhh!\" is the cry from the grandstand as Monty makes birdie at 10 to go to -10. Tiger can only make par to stay at -11. 5.28pm: Monty's hit his second to the 10th within six feet, but Tiger has to settle for being 15-feet away. Meanwhile Tracey Busher is supporting Kate 'Harry Potter in five hours\" Carter. \"I'm betting that what Kate doesn't mention is that, during those five hours, she's probably also made her husband breakfast and lunch, done his laundry and ironing and cleaned up after him and run numerous errands. Men don't know they're born, do they?!\" 5.24pm: Current leaderboard: Woods -11, Olazabal -10, Goosen and Montgomerie -9, Campbell, Clark, Garcia, Verplank, Immelman -7. 5.20pm: Monster putt from Olazabal on 12 for eagle! The Spaniard, who's only playing because Seve Ballesteros withdrew, is now second on -10. 5.18pm Amazing stuff! Monty blasts his eagle putt several feet past but makes his birdie to move to -9. Meanwhile Tiger, who has to take a drop, has a putt for birdie (despite his penalty stroke). That misses, but Tiger makes a tricky one to go out in 36 - level par. 5.12pm: Meanwhile Monty is on the green in one! \"Is Kate really implying that loading a washing machine and removing a few items from a cupboard absorbs more than two hours of her time?\" asks Steven Woodhams. \"Or does it seem more likely that she's embarrassed by her inferior speed reading capabilities? Either way, spending a considerable part of your day reading a children's book is not something to be proud of.... is it?\" I'm not sure, Steven - I bet there are plenty of adults reading Harry Potter VI's 600-plus pages today. 5.10pm: Tiger in the bushes again! He's been driving the par-four ninth on previous days but he goes horribly left. Still, all may not be lost - he may yet take a penalty and chip and putt out for four. 5.07pm: Ernie Els finishes with a disappointing 75, and drops to level par for the tournament. Meanwhile the Harry Potter row continues. \"If Kate wants to feel vindicated through taking two hours to do the laundry and tidy a wardrobe - to say nothing of 'sorting out a cupboard' - then that's entirely up to her,\" says Tom King. \"What exactly had the cupboard done to warrant such harsh disciplinary measures?\" 5.03pm: Fantastic recovery from Woods! He plays a brilliant chip shot to within four feet and, after deliberating over his par putt for a good minute (he even calls his caddy over to read the line) saves par. 4.57pm: Listen to those sighs of frustration! Garcia's just bogeyed 11 to move back to -7. 4.55pm: Tiger has a shocker on the par-three eighth - he's just hit it 40 yards over the green and will have difficulty making par. Monty also is at the back of the green. Meanwhile Kate Carter retaliates. \"The five hours of reading Harry Potter also included doing the laundry, tidying my wardrobe, and sorting out a cupboard in my parents' house. Pah!\" 4.48pm: As the wind continues to freshen, Tiger rattles in a 20-footer on the seventh to move two shots ahead on -11. Monty, from a similiar distance, can only make par. 4.45pm: The players are really beginning to bunch now. Langer's just gone to -6 with a birdie on 15. Meanwhile Tom King writes: \"Are we supposed to be impressed by Kate Carter's 'speed-reading' efforts? I finished 'HPATHBP' in three hours, at 11.30 this morning, ensuring my lie-in till 8.30am was undisturbed.\" Any advances on that? 4.40pm: Latest leaderboard: Woods -10, Goosen -9, Garcia and Montgomerie -8, Campbell, Clark, Allenby, Daly and Olazabal -7. Meanwhile Kate Carter has emailed in to say she's just finished the new Harry Potter book in five hours. Hats off. 4.33pm: Massive putt from Sergio! He makes eagle at nine to move to -8. Meanwhile Tiger bogeys the sixth to drop to -10. 4.28pm: Tiger takes a drop onto the walkways. He's very lucky - he could've easily ended up miles into the bushes. Still, he's likely to drop at least one shot here. 4.25pm: Daly makes birdie on the 12th to move back to -7. Meanwhile Tim Rogers writes: \"Anyone else back Tiger and spend their winnings last night? I did - \u00a350 at 3-1 - blown in various establishments because I thought Tiger was home and hosed. Now I'm starting to worry...\" And you should, Tim... 4.21pm: Tiger in trouble on six! From the tee he smashes it way wide into the crowd - and it lands into the bushes. He could be dropping a couple of shots here... 4.17pm: Tiger misses his eagle putt at five, but taps in for an easy birdie to move back to -11. Meanwhile Monty nails a 10-footer to move to -8. Cue more cries of \"Come on Monty!\" 4.12pm: Clarke birdies 12 to go to -8. Meanwhile the latest bookies' odds are: Tiger 2-7, Goosen 10-1, Monty 10-1, Clark 25-1, Garcia 33-1. 4.08pm: Superb stuff from Sandy Lyle, who birdies the last to move to -6. Meanwhile his playing partner, Retief Goosen, also makes birdie for a 66 to move to -9 and this 134th Open is alive again. 4.04pm: Monty stays at seven under after making a tricky putt on four. Meanwhile James Green writes: \"I know this is completely off topic but Big Brother last night was probably some of the funniest TV I have seen this year! Does anyone agree with me or was my view clouded by the large volume of alcohol I had consumed leading up to the eviction?\" Missed it, James. Anyone else? 4.02pm: Michael Campbell finishes with a birdie for a 68, and moves to -7. Meanwhile his player partner, Luke Donald, finishes with a 77 and drops to +2. 4pm: Tiger's not playing brilliantly so far: his approach to four only makes the fringe, but a good 20-footer putt seals par. He now leads by two from Goosen, who drops one at 17 to move to -8. 3.55pm: Adam Scott, many a pundit's tip (including mine) comes in on -5 after shooting a 70. It could've been better: he bogeyed 17 and only just missed an eagle putt on 18. 3.50pm: Monty and Tiger both par the third. Meanwhile more on Nicklaus. \"I hope Jack does retire - an absolute legend who everyone will remember still mixing it with the best of 'em, rather than a sad old fella that is wheeled out over and over again,\" says David Booth. \"May he enjoy his retirement, he's deserved a long and happy one.\" 3.47pm: Current leaderboard: Woods -10, Goosen -9, Clark, Appleby, Daly, Verplank, Montgomerie, Lonard, Immelman -7, Mickelson (who's just dropped a shot on 12), Clark, Perry and others -6 3.44pm: A birdie on six for Garcia takes him to -6. Meanwhile Josh Nall writes: \"Re: James Green's comments. As far as I'm aware, Jack will not be allowed to play in any more Opens, as he will be over 65, the mandatory age limit - the only exemption would have been if he had finnished in the top ten this year, which he didn't. Shame.\" 3.40pm: Goosen on the charge! He birdies the 16th (his sixth in 11 holes) to move to -9, just one behind Tiger. Meanwhile Vijay's bogeyed the third to drop to -4. 3.37pm: This from James Green: \"Does anyone else think that yesterday won't be the last we see of the Golden Bear? Golfers are a bit like boxers in the sense that they never quit, golf is in his blood and I for one would love to see him again!\" I'm not sure, James - but my guess is that Jack won't play again. He's one of these people that wants to win at all costs, and not making the cut doesn't really hold much appeal for him. 3.35pm: Monty makes his par at the second, but Tiger misses a five-footer and falls to -10. Listen to those cheers of \"Come on Monty!\" 3.30pm: Another near miss at the eighth from from John Daly, who stays at -7. However his playing partner Robert Allenby nails a longer putt to join him at -7. Still no one making a big move on Tiger, however. 3.25pm: It's suddenly started to get quite windy - which might yet makes things more interesting. Tiger is short with his second to the second, while Monty has a 30-foot putt for birdie. 3.19pm: Monty's long birdie putt from at least 25 foot at the first is almost perfect, but it dies millimetres from the hole. Tiger, meanwhile, also makes a safe par. 3.16pm: Mickelson is making a charge - his fourth birdie of the day on 10 takes him to -7. He'll need a few more, mind, to have a chance tomorrow. 3.12pm: Not a good start for Vijay, who - like Ernie Els and Sergio Garcia before him - bogeys the first to fall to -5. 3.09pm: An enormous cheer greets Colin Montgomerie as he steps onto the first tee and plays a safe iron down the right hand side. Tiger's shot is more central, but less powerful. 3.07pm: Freddie Jacobson, who has done nothing for two years, is showing signs of hitting his best form this week and a birdie on nine takes him to -6. Meanwhile Vijay Singh has just teed off. Can he stop the final two days being a procession? 3pm: Clark, who won the Scottish Open last week, has made a storming start. However misses a makeable putt on six and stays at -8. 2.55pm: Daly misses a long eagle putt on five, and then fails to make a tiddler for birdie, and so stays on -7. Garcia has birdied the second to move back to -5. 2.51pm: Current scoreboard - Woods -11, Clark (who's just birdied the 5th) -8, Daly, Montgomerie, Verplank -7, (breathe) Hansen, Lafeber, Clarke, Perry, Goosen, Jacobson, Allenby, Olazabal, Faxon, Immelman, Lonard, Singh (and exhale) -6. 2.45pm: Not a good start for Sergio Garcia, who bogeys the first to fall to -4. Meanwhile Greg Norman has finished on -3 after a decent 70. The story of day three so far: Scoring is even easier today, with a huge number of players shooting under par. No one has yet mounted a charge, sadly, but John Daly has started 3, 3, 3 to move to -7, alongside Tim Clark. The suspicion is that, short of an act of God, Tiger Woods has got the 134th Open in the bag. He's 5-6 to win by at least four shorts, which looks a great price."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
