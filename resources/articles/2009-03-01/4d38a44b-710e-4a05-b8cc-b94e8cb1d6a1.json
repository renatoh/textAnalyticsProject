That they passed it prompted hope to course the veins of all those associated with the club. There is no feeling quite like winning on penalties and Arsenal experienced it when, in the third round of sudden death and with emotion stamping wildly through the stands, Max Tonetto, the Roma midfielder, lifted his head and then his kick over the crossbar. This stadium holds unhappy shoot-out memories for Roma. They had lost the European Cup final here to Liverpool in 1984 after one such lottery. But their misery did not touch Arsenal nor dampen their joyous celebrations. Victory had been cast into doubt when Eduardo, the substitute, sent the first kick of the shoot-out weakly at the goalkeeper Doni. But the momentum changed when Mirko Vucinic shot straight down the middle and found that Manuel Almunia had not moved. The Arsenal players to distinguish themselves in sudden death were Kolo Tour\u00e9, Bacary Sagna and Abou Diaby \u2013 William Gallas, the most experienced Arsenal player, did not put his hand up to take a penalty \u2013 and Wenger acknowledged that the group would grow from this. Arsenal's triumph completed a clean sweep for English teams over their Italian counterparts in the last 16 and maintained the remarkable statistic which shows that Premier Leagues sides have not lost in Europe's elite competition to a continental rival since 2007. Could Arsenal yet sate Wenger's hunger and return to this venue in May to lift the trophy? After all, Cesc F\u00e1bregas, Tomas Rosicky and Emmanuel Adebayor, the club's injured stars, should have returned by the time the quarter-finals kick-off next month. The prospect cannot be ruled out after a performance rich in energy, commitment and character. Arsenal had suffered a testing examination in the first half of normal time, when they went an early goal down and might have conceded another. Roma raged about the non-award of a penalty in the 45th minute which might have settled the issue long before the dramatic denouement. Marco Motta tore into the penalty area and he went down under Ga\u00ebl Clichy's clumsy challenge, in which he looked to lay his hands on the Roma midfielder. Manuel Mejuto Gonz\u00e1lez, the referee, was perhaps the only person inside the stadium who did not see an offence. The crowd howled and even Wenger later admitted that he was worried. Arsenal created little of clear-cut value and it was Roma who threatened to move the tie beyond their opponents. There was a patched up feel to the Italians and Francesco Totti, who has struggled with a knee problem, played out extra-time virtually on one leg. The defender Juan, who wore a heavy strapping on the back of his leg, required treatment after making a saving challenge on Robin van Persie in the early going, after the Arsenal forward had hared through. He was forced off midway through the first-half but by then he had made a telling contribution that sparked delirium in the stands. Totti's low cross from the left ought to have been dealt with comfortably but Gallas and Tour\u00e9 left it for each other in a fatal split second of hesitation and, when Rodrigo Taddei dummied, the ball reached Juan at the far post, after he had been allowed to run unchecked into space. He had time to steady himself and slam a low shot past Almunia. Roma played around Arsenal for spells of the first half and midway thought it, they went close to a second goal. The excellent Motta broke through the inside right channel and unloaded a drive that Almunia did well to beat away. Motta, though, retrieved the ball with a cross from the by-line and, after Tour\u00e9 had half cleared, Taddei's fierce strike drew another save from the Arsenal goalkeeper. The eye-catching performances were from those in red \u2013 Vucinic and Totti excelled when Roma were in the ascendancy \u2013 and Arsenal had to dig deep. They did flicker. Sagna glanced a header from a corner straight at Doni while Emmanuel Ebou\u00e9's ball for Nicklas Bendtner, on a fast break, was just too heavy. The mood changed as the second-half minutes ticked by and a strange sense of foreboding appeared to grip the home fans. Murmurs of trepidation replaced the din that had previously held sway. Arsenal fashioned a foothold and with Theo Walcott on from the substitutes' bench, they began to believe they could nick the result. Although Julio Baptista, the former Arsenal forward, was guilty of a horrible miss in the 79th minute, with the goal gaping in front of him, it was Arsenal who finished the stronger. They were the better side in extra-time and, ultimately, they conjured a famous victory."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
