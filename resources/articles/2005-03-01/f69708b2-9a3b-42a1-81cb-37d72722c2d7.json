The sudden departure of Best Mate from the field for the 2005 Gold Cup means that he is now most unlikely to equal Golden Miller's all-time record of five victories in the race. A fourth Gold Cup would also have surpassed the Cheltenham record of Arkle, the greatest chaser the sport has seen and a three-time winner of the race. Yesterday's news was a huge disappointment not only for Best Mate's connections, but also for the thousands of punters who will now start Cheltenham Festival week with a significant hole in their bankroll. A spokesman for Ladbrokes suggested yesterday that across the betting industry as a whole, at least \u00a3500,000 had been staked on Best Mate extending his winning run in the Gold Cup to four. Henrietta Knight, Best Mate's trainer, said that she believed yesterday's problem may be linked to the chaser's trip to Leopardstown at Christmas, when he finished second to Beef Or Salmon in the Lexus Chase. \"He has broken a blood vessel on the gallops this morning and it will not have healed in time for the Gold Cup,\" Knight said yesterday. \"It is very disappointing. \"Whenever they break a blood vessel it is serious but it is not career-threatening and hopefully he will come back as good as new next season. It is absolutely shattering, but it is better that it happened on the gallops rather than at Cheltenham.\" Jim Lewis, Best Mate's owner, added that he expected Best Mate to return to Cheltenham next year. \"It's very sad for all of us, [but] you would think it was a disaster,\" Lewis said. \"Well, it isn't a disaster. A tsunami is a disaster. \"I'm really sorry for everyone who lost money, including myself, but we are hopeful that he will be back to normal next year and whoever wins the Gold Cup this year, I shall wish him all the best and remind him that he has only borrowed it. \"He went on to the gallops at about 9.30am, and Jackie [Jenner, Best Mate's groom and work rider] was not happy with him as he got into the middle of his work. She slowed him down and pulled to a halt and there was blood coming down his nose.\" Best Mate was the 5-2 favourite for the Gold Cup with most bookmakers, despite his defeat at Leopardstown in December. In the last two runnings of the race he has been heavily supported on Gold Cup day itself, and landed one of the biggest gambles of the season in the 2003 renewal. \"This is a massive blow for punters, many of whom would have made Best Mate their banker of the meeting,\" David Stevens, of Coral, said yesterday. \"Although we would have liked to see Best Mate line up next Friday, we have been top price about him for most of the season, and would have faced a payout of at least \u00a3750,000 if he had made it four in a row.\" The loss of Best Mate will also be a significant disappointment for Cheltenham, where the Festival extends to a fourth day this year for the first time. The Gold Cup is the feature race on the final day of the meeting. The ante-post market for the Gold Cup now has a new favourite for the first time since Best Mate's initial victory in 2002. Kingscliff, runner-up to Kicking King in the King George VI Chase at Kempton on Boxing Day, is now top-priced at 9-2 with Coral, while Strong Flow is 11-2 with William Hill. Kingscliff is 7-2 with Ladbrokes, who have Strong Flow on 9-2."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
