The preservation of the Amazon rainforest, a vital sink for carbon dioxide, is widely considered by scientists and activists to be a priority in responding to the climate crisis. However, the Brazilian soy farmers\u2019 association Aprosoja has mounted a campaign to end a voluntary ban on trading crops harvested from newly cleared land. Aprosoja has claimed to have the backing of Bolsonaro, who has come under heavy international criticism as he advocated increased economic development of the Amazon even as vast fires burned swathes of rainforest during the summer. Many of those fires were started deliberately by farmers to clear land for crops or cattle. The letter to the Brazilian government calls for the extension of the Amazon soy moratorium (ASM), a 2006 agreement signed by companies to prevent the use of new land for the production of soy. Soy is used mainly as agricultural feed, as well as a food for human consumption such as tofu and soy sauce. The signatories to the letter include some of Europe and the UK\u2019s largest supermarket chains \u2013 including Aldi, Asda, Carrefour, Iceland, Marks &amp; Spencer, Waitrose and Morrisons \u2013 and food producers such as Mars. Investor signatories, who together control assets worth more than \u00a32.5tn, include the Dutch firm Robeco and the Canadian investor BMO Global Asset Management, as well as Legal &amp; General Investment Management, the UK\u2019s largest asset manager. The letter said: \u201cWe want to be able to continue to source from, or invest in, the Brazilian soy industry but if the ASM is not maintained, this will risk our business with Brazilian soy.\u201d Peter Andrews, head of sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, which represents many of the signatories, said they were seeking assurances from the Brazilian government that the moratorium would remain. \u201cCustomers expect the products they buy not to harm the environment, and retailers invest heavily in their supply chains to deliver that as far as possible,\u201d he said. The letter, which was coordinated by the Farm Animal Investment Risk &amp; Return Initiative, argued that continued increases in soy production were possible without further destroying the rainforest. Brazil was the world\u2019s largest soybean exporter in 2016-17, sending 60.3m metric tonnes abroad, the vast majority to China\u2019s rapidly expanding meat industry, according to the US Department of Agriculture. Lower land and labour costs than the US have made Brazil the key sources of soybeans to China. China\u2019s dependence on Brazil for the crop increased last year, when US soybeans were the subject of retaliatory tariffs in the trade war between Beijing and Washington. In March scientists writing in the Nature journal warned of a possible \u201csurge of tropical deforestation\u201d in the wake of the tariffs, as Bolsonaro\u2019s government weakened protections and Brazilian producers sought to replace their US rivals. Bolsonaro\u2019s widely condemned policies have drawn comparisons with his US counterpart, Donald Trump, who has also advocated deregulation \u2013 in the face of a global consensus in favour of action on the environment. In the US more than 70 CEOs, companies and union leaders signed a separate letter published on Monday calling for the US to remain within the Paris Climate Agreement, only weeks after Trump began the year-long process to exit the international accord. The signatories include two of the world\u2019s biggest tech firms, Google and Microsoft, and the FTSE-listed energy company National Grid. John Pettigrew, National Grid\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cThe scale and potential impact of the climate crisis has never been more real. The promise of the Paris Agreement is one of a just and prosperous world \u2013 something that can only be achieved through a collective effort of business, unions and governments that places climate action at the heart of everything we do.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
