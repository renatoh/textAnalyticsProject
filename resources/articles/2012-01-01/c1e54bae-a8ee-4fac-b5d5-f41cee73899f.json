Berlioz, Bizet and Debussy were among its winners. Ravel and Messiaen famously lost, as did Saint-Sa\u00ebns, whose entries have been unearthed by conductor Herv\u00e9 Niquet for this fascinating set. Candidates were required to submit a cantata and a short choral work. Saint-Sa\u00ebns entered twice, in 1852 and 1864, and we're conscious, on each occasion, of nods in the direction of musical fashion. His 1852 cantata, Le Retour de Virginie, shows the influence of Daniel Auber, then very popular, while its choral equivalent, Choeur de Sylphes, sounds like Mendelssohn fairy music with voices. Saint-Sa\u00ebns' 1864 choral Ode, meanwhile, is reminiscent of Berlioz, while the corresponding cantata, Ivanho\u00e9, has strong overtones of both Verdi and Meyerbeer. Niquet conducts his Belgian forces with infectious enthusiasm, and the choral singing is consistently lovely. The real treat, though, is Ivanho\u00e9, based on Walter Scott's hugely popular novel. Bernard Richter plays the eponymous knight who rescues Marina de Liso's hapless Rebecca from Pierre-Yves Pruvot's wicked Bois-Guilbert. It's gung-ho, thrill-a-minute stuff and tremendous fun."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
