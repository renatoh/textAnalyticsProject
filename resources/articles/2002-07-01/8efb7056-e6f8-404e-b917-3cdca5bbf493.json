Nowhere, however, can they have looked more odd than in Liverpool. While the rest of the country's Sex Pistols fans covered themselves in safety pins, their Scouse devotees took sartorial matters into their own hands. According to one contemporary account, their accoutrements included necklaces made from apples, kettles serving as handbags and earrings fashioned from tampons. At punk's height, one teenager expressed his individuality by walking around Liverpool with a box of Milk Tray on his head. Strange behaviour that nevertheless fits a regional stereotype. In the context of the British music scene, Liverpool has spent the past 25 years behaving like a principality, with a set of by-laws incomprehensible to anyone beyond the Merseyside region. While England dabbled in eyeliner and new romanticism, Liverpool's music fans dressed in dungarees and listened to the Pale Fountains' bossa-nova pop. Later in the 1980s, style mags incredulously reported the rise of the \"psychedelic scally\": a flare-wearing, dope-smoking Scouse football hooligan with a penchant for Frank Zappa. Liverpudlian rock, meanwhile, became one of those English regional curiosities that no one else in the country understands or cares about, like clog-dancing or cheese-rolling. Manchester produced such epochal artists as the Smiths, the Stone Roses and Oasis; Liverpool offered a succession of arcane oddities. There was Half Man Half Biscuit, who sang about hating Nerys Hughes; the beatific, drug-addled Strands; the Stairs, who scuppered any chances of success by recording in mono and wearing fake moustaches and ponchos on their album cover. During the 1990s, Liverpool's biggest contribution to mainstream rock culture involved dispatching platoons of terrifying feral scallies to mug people at Glastonbury. In these post-Britpop times, however, all bets are off on what might be the next big thing. Suddenly, people are taking notice of Liverpool again. The excitement centres around the Coral, a sextet of unprepossessing teenagers from nearby Hoylake. They released their debut single last year, yet have already earned a remarkable live reputation and a recording contract allegedly worth a fortune. The Coral are very much a product of Liverpool's cultural isolation. From the moment their debut album begins, there can be little doubt that this music has grown up apart from commonly accepted notions of cool. The Coral sound as unlike mainstream alternative rock in 2002 as the Stone Roses did in the late 1980s. Spanish Main opens with a screech of feedback, a rumbling drum tattoo, a gradually building wall of echoing guitar noises. \"We'll set sail again, we're heading for the Spanish main,\" repeat a chorus of lusty voices. After barely two minutes, it stops. End of track one. As statements of musical intent go, it is simultaneously bewildering and exciting. You have no idea what to expect next, but you're incredibly eager to find out. What you discover is a mass of remarkable contradictions. The Coral are traditionalists. Techno experiments are out; the burst of house music that closes Skeleton Key is overlaid with mocking laughter. Yet theirs is not the stifling fundamentalism of Noel Gallagher, who recently suggested American rock bands would improve if they - wait for it - \"listened to the Beatles and made some proper music\". Instead, the Coral explore 1960s rock's extremities, areas too strange for Britpop's crowd-pleasing conformity. Skeleton Key is audibly in thrall to Captain Beefheart's psychedelic blues. The spectre of early Pink Floyd and their LSD-damaged founder Syd Barrett hangs over Goodbye. Whereas other bands have shown a horrible tendency to distil Beefheart's bleak surrealism and Barrett's mental illness into sniggering sub-Monty Python zaniness, the Coral are devoid of undergraduate smugness. There is certainly a dopey sense of humour on display, but it is balanced by depth and darkness. Skeleton Key lurches on, slide guitars wailing, singer James Skelly's voice hoarse with foreboding, a genuinely disturbing piece of music. The Coral may well be the first band to find inspiration in Barrett and Beefheart without making you want to punch them. The same is true of their - gulp - reggae influence. Previous incidents involving Sting, UB40 and idiotic crusty rabble-rousers Back to the Planet suggest some sort of law should be passed banning white artists from dabbling in reggae. Yet here, Shadows Fall skanks along endearingly, pausing only to test the listener's incredulity further with a burst of big-band jazz. The Coral's debut album is full of such inexplicable pleasures. Wildly inventive, entirely removed from current trends, it wears its Scouse colours proudly. Buried within its unique, ever-shifting sound, you will find echoes of the forgotten Liverpudlian bands of the 1990s, the warped R&amp;B of the Stairs, the Strands' harmonic sweetness. At times, it sounds like a potted aural history of an ignored regional subculture. More importantly, however, it sounds like a fantastic debut album by a boundless and frighteningly talented band."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
