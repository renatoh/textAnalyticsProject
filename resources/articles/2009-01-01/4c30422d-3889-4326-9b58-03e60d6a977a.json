Hankey missed a hatful of opportunities to close out the match as a valiant O'Shea refused to lie down and fought back from 6\u20134 to down level at 6\u20136, but he finally took out double 10 at the second attempt in the 12th set to win the deciding set 3\u20131 and regain the title he last won in 2000. \"I had so many chances to win it. I missed double top and double 10 I think,\" Hankey said. \"I thought, I ain't going to win this. I kept missing and I thought that I'm done here. Tony played so well. I am over the moon, but this guy's time will come. I am sorry I beat him, but I am glad I'm a world champion.\" O'Shea struggled for consistency after winning the first set and was always playing catch-up after going in 4\u20132 behind at the break. \"I don't know what was happening in the first six sets. Ted looked like he was going to romp it,\" O'Shea said. \"But I never give up. Even if I was 6\u20130 down I would never give up.\" Hankey had two darts for the match at 2-1 up in the 11th set, but inexplicably missed a fat 12, which would have set up a double-top finish, and O'Shea levelled before holding his throw to make it 6\u20135. The Count missed another double for the title when 2\u20130 up in the next set and six more darts went begging at 2\u20132 as O'Shea levelled the match at 6\u20136. Hankey was not to be denied, though, as he finally nestled a dart in the double 10 bed to take the title."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
