The interim manager said he was envious of Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s squad after Tuesday\u2019s Champions League game, citing the strength of their bench as a key factor in the 2-1 defeat. With a place in next season\u2019s Champions League appearing unlikely, Chelsea may find players dissuaded from moving to Stamford Bridge. Hiddink would not comment on how many signings he thinks are required, saying it is for those behind the scenes to make such decisions, but suggested experience was required. Although much has been made of Chelsea\u2019s younger players not being given enough chances in Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s latter days as manager, Hiddink said he would like to have them involved more but, in a long season, experience trumps youth. \u201cIt\u2019s not a small job,\u201d he said of the new manager\u2019s task. \u201cI don\u2019t want to open up too much but everyone has to make good analysis about the strength of the squad, about the weakness of the squad, and accordingly they have to react in building up, or making the squad stronger for next season. That\u2019s not a small job. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go into details. I am here in the interim period and the people who are not responsible for the every day, every week stuff and games, they have the longer vision of what is the need of this club, they are in charge to do that.\u201d As for the gap between Chelsea and other European clubs, Hiddink said: \u201cYou see the potential of those clubs, it\u2019s huge. To be honest, if you see PSG, they have a very strong, not just first 11, but can go on to 15, 16, 17 big players. \u201cWe had some youngsters on the bench against PSG. I am not scared to bring them in but in the long run of a lot of games, you need a bench which is also very experienced.\u201d He is also confident Manchester City\u2019s players will not waver in their commitment to Manuel Pellegrini for the remainder of the season because \u201cthey are not stupid\u201d and will be keen to pay the outgoing manager back for the success he has brought to the club. Hiddink and Pellegrini meet in the FA Cup fifth round on Sunday with both sets of players aware they will be working under new coaches next season. But Hiddink reckons standards will not plunge at either club, adding that Pep Guardiola\u2019s arrival at the Etihad should not serve as a distraction to the City squad. City could still win an historic quadruple, despite Pellegrini promising to field a weakened team at Stamford Bridge on account of Wednesday\u2019s Champions League game at Dynamo Kyiv. However the commitment of some players, including Yaya Tour\u00e9, who is expected to leave the club in the summer, has been questioned following anaemic performances since the announcement of Guardiola\u2019s appointment. \u201cI don\u2019t think it has an effect on the players if the players [continue to] work with the manager as they have done,\u201d Hiddink said. \u201cWith Pellegrini in recent years and with the way he works \u2013 I can only make a judgment from distance \u2013 he is well respected by the squad. \u201cAnd if the respect is there then I don\u2019t see any inconvenience. Everyone knows he is leaving the club and to go on with him I think he deserves that respect. The players are not stupid \u2013 they want to pay something back to him as well personally I think.\u201cIt is very clear what is happening now at Man City. Everyone is aware of the situation and the big players, with big hearts, they know exactly what to do in the club. And I think in [Pellegrini\u2019s] case the players will have a lot of respect for him.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
