Djurg\u00e5rden\u2019s players would haul themselves out for another assignment, the finishing line a crucial step closer each time, and invariably do the job required of them; the only problem was that everyone else would do exactly the same and it means that, when the whistles blow on Saturday lunchtime for the season\u2019s final round of Allsvenskan, three teams still have a realistic chance of prevailing in one of Europe\u2019s tightest title races for years. It has essentially been a three-way version of the relentless, blow-for-blow slugfest that eventually saw Manchester City stay ahead of Liverpool in May. \u201cYou\u2019re like: \u2018Yeah, can someone get us a result?\u2019 But it just hasn\u2019t happened \u2013 the top three have just been winning, winning, winning,\u201d says Edwards, the Djurg\u00e5rden midfielder. The contenders \u2013 Djurg\u00e5rden, Malm\u00f6 FF and Hammarby, in that order \u2013 have dropped points in only four of the 24 games they have collectively contested in the past eight matchdays, and half of those were games between two of them. Until Monday four teams were involved, but then Malm\u00f6 finally laid AIK\u2019s dreams to rest and left things on a knife-edge. Djurg\u00e5rden need a point from their trip to fifth-placed Norrk\u00f6ping to win their first title since 2005; quite a return to relevance for a traditional giant that has not managed a top-two finish since then. But they have comfortably the most difficult fixture; Malm\u00f6, three points behind, visit mid-table \u00d6rebro and are tied with Hammarby, who could win it on home turf against H\u00e4cken. There is hardly anything to separate the trio\u2019s goal difference. If Djurg\u00e5rden slip up then they are under few illusions: their chance to banish a decade and a half of ghosts will have gone. It has been some induction for Edwards, an English midfielder who rose to prominence during \u00d6stersund\u2019s Europa League run under Graham Potter two seasons ago. The 25-year-old signed a three-and-a-half-year contract with the Stockholm club at the end of July, just over halfway through the season. Six minutes into his debut he scored his first goal and neither party has looked back since, with Edwards largely pulling the strings from the No 10 position (although he has showed his versatility by playing to the right and left of midfield as well). Plugging straight into the enervating mentality of challengers, of not being willing or able to concede an inch, has been a test. \u201cWe speak about it in the team and just say we\u2019ve got to continue what we\u2019ve been doing all season,\u201d he says. \u201cAlthough I\u2019ve only been here for a few months you can feel there\u2019s a real togetherness, belief and hardworking attitude. If we have that it can take us a long way.\u201d It helps that, as far as Edwards can tell, there have not been exorbitant levels of pressure from outside. He just wants to get on with playing the title-deciding game and cannot wait for Saturday to come around; Djurg\u00e5rden\u2019s fans feel the same way but they have not been stopping him in the street to hype things up even if letting in Hammarby, their city rivals, would surely feel like a mortal blow in reality. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive club with a big following but I think we\u2019ve surprised a lot of the supporters already,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t really think this was in their expectations. It\u2019s in our hands and we don\u2019t want to let it slip now, but the fans are OK. They\u2019re really proud of what team have done until now. A club of this size should be competing every year and unfortunately we haven\u2019t for a long time, so hopefully we can give something back to them.\u201d The team\u2019s joint head coaches, Kim Bergstrand and Thomas Lagerl\u00f6f, have taken many of the plaudits. This is their first season, having spent six years working wonders in lifting unfancied Sirius all the way from the third tier, and an outwardly unorthodox arrangement has paid off spectacularly. Edwards says they are \u201creally in sync with each other\u201d and he was impressed with the vision they sold him during the summer, promising he would be playing the kind of ambitious, technical football that Potter preached on his own way up the ladder. It says plenty that, just ahead of Edwards on the pitch, Djurg\u00e5rden can field the league\u2019s top joint-top scorer in Mohamed Buya Turay, a Sierra Leone international on loan from the Belgian club Sint-Truiden. Edwards says the main difference from life at \u00d6stersund is the sheer depth of quality and competition for places; he has mastered it so far, though, and it is the latest leap in a career whose rise verges on fairytale status. \u201cIf I look back three years, and speak about it with my friends and family, you\u2019d never think it is possible that I could be preparing for a game like Saturday\u2019s,\u201d he says. A little over three years ago he was still playing in Sweden\u2019s fifth tier with Ytterhogdal, where he had moved for a change of scene after early promise with Middlesbrough\u2019s academy fizzled out and left him in non-league. \u201cI only came across here to experience something new and it was never in my thoughts that I would make this journey,\u201d he says. \u201cI have to remind myself that I\u2019ve been through some bad parts in my career but this, now, is amazing and what you want as a footballer.\u201d Seeing things through on Saturday would probably top everything he achieved at \u00d6stersund, he says after a moment\u2019s thought, pointing out that Champions League football had hardly ever been on his radar. There is still a huge job to do. Norrk\u00f6ping have lost only twice at home, the most recent time coming in June, and beat Hammarby 2-0 at Nya Parken in September. \u201cThey\u2019ve got really good quality so it\u2019s going to be tough,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we are going for the three points, that\u2019s the target, not just to protect a draw. We want to go there and show why it could be us winning the trophy.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
