Jol has watched with a mixture of disbelief and rage as his expensively assembled side have slipped to defeats in their opening Premiership fixtures, against promoted Sunderland and Everton. He accepts the need to beat Derby Country tomorrow, another newcomer to the league, at White Hart Lane but dismisses the notion of looming crisis. Levy met Jol after the Everton defeat and while the chairman shared the manager's disappointment and craves finishing in a Champions League qualifying position this season, he is not about to panic. The Dutchman's position is safe. Levy sympathises about the squad's injury problems and the pair also discussed transfer targets. They are confident that Curtis Davies, the central defender, will join from West Bromich Albion while Jol also advanced the name of Rafael van der Vaart, Hamburg's Dutch midfielder. Despite the frenzied reaction to the two defeats which have left them bottom of the table, Jol has built up sufficient credit since succeeding Jacques Santini in November 2004 and has urged fans to try to see the bigger picture. He has taken the club to four cup quarter-finals plus a semi-final and has achieved consecutive fifth-place Premiership finishes. \"Daniel feels that he is in the same boat and we have meetings every week,\" said Jol. \"It's an important time for us, the transfer window shuts in two weeks. We were discussing our whole situation and he was very supportive. Everybody is responsible. We gave this club 125 points in the last two seasons, so that hasn't been forgotten after four days. \"It's about spells and every club has bad spells, although it's not good if you start [the season] with one. But the only thing you hope for is that people give you a bit of time. I will take the blows and the players will have to stand up and do better for us. I've talked about things with the players. That is what we do.\" Jol retains the conviction that his best team can beat anyone but he is some way from selecting it. He hopes to have Lee Young-pyo, the left-back, available for tomorrow but Gareth Bale and Benoit Assou-Ekotto, his other options in the position, are short of fitness. Ledley King, Michael Dawson and Younes Kaboul, his best three central defenders, are out while Aaron Lennon, the winger, and Dimitar Berbatov, the striker, complete the injury list. Berbatov has been to visit Dr Hans Muller Wolfhart in Germany about a groin problem, which has flared again, but Jol claimed that surgery would not be required. Southampton have completed the signing of the Burnley defender Wayne Thomas in a \u00a31m deal. The 28-year-old centre-half has signed a three-year contract after passing a medical at St Mary's. George Burley, the Saints manager, said: \"Wayne is an experienced defender who has played a lot of games for Stoke and Burnley over the last five or six years and he is a player I have admired for a long time. I tried to get him at Derby but just missed out because at the time we couldn't buy anyone. \"I was aware Wayne wanted a new challenge and I'm delighted to have got him. We had to pay a lot of money but letting Pele join West Brom enabled us to do that. We were looking for a leader and an organiser with experience in this league and he has that sort of toughness. There are not many in that category.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
