During a decade working at Sportspages bookshop we held scores of these events, a sequence that began in more innocent times with genuine sports fans patiently waiting to spend a couple of minutes with the author, getting their personal dedication and the most forward of them a handshake. By the end of my time there the professional autograph hunter, an odd breed who would not have looked out of place in the League of Gentlemen, had besieged us. Brazenly presumptuous and extremely chippy, they would come armed with marker pens and a portfolio of glossy photographs and even replica shirts they would expect to have signed that would then appear on eBay within a couple of hours. When cameras began to be incorporated into mobile phones a new craze was unleashed and hundreds of people must have blurred photographs of themselves with their arms around a gurning sportsman trapped on obsolete handsets at the back of drawers. The most impudent of customers will also have long-forgotten answerphone outgoing messages coerced from the likes of Frank Worthington or Dickie Bird. No wonder, then, that Blair's publishers have explicitly banned mobile phones. The pictures take too long to set up and with the ability to check the results instantly there are usually requests to take it again if the flash fails or the subject and his new best mate are captured mid blink. When film was used, the commandeered cameraman, often me, could get away with pointing and clicking haphazardly, safe in the knowledge that they would have to get it developed before berating you. I am surprised, though, at the objection to dedications. Yes, they draw out the encounter for a few seconds more but it is a guaranteed way of stopping them being sold on for profit. Despite the stringent stipulations, however, Blair should still draw a crowd. There is nothing as embarrassing for the shop floor staff as a poorly attended signing event. We had some huge successes with Muhammad Ali in 1992 the pinnacle, the great man stopping traffic on Charing Cross Road by marshalling all his efforts into an audience-pleasing shuffle. Each signature took about a minute for him to finish but he did not leave until everyone in the crocodile that had trailed halfway to Leicester Square had got what they came for. Sir Alex Ferguson, too, was a trouper, a model of charm even with the Liverpool and Manchester City fans determined on a bit of banter and Les Ferdinand was touchingly enchanted by a delegation of Besiktas fans, for whom he had played a season on loan 15 years previously, chanting rude things about Fenerbahce in his honour. We were caught by surprise on a few occasions, ordering hundreds of copies for someone such as Nasser Hussain when only a trickle turned up yet being dumbstruck by the hordes who turned up for Mario Andretti, a Saturday morning petrol head convention that resembled a Top Gear studio audience. Andretti's fellow Formula One world champion Damon Hill, by contrast, was unhappy throughout his session and could not leave quickly enough. Sir Garfield Sobers had a moment of Chuck Berry-type truculence and walked out when his hour was up leaving the stragglers in the queue without autographs. Given his mood that day they were probably the lucky ones \u2013 many of those who had met him ended up being chastised by the all-rounder for not having the book open at the correct page. Most of England's 1966 World Cup winners, it must be said, seemed to be a pretty miserable bunch. Feeling their achievements had been undervalued metaphorically and financially, they were very wary about being exploited even for the promotion of their own books. George Cohen was a notable exception, the perfect graduate of the friendly Fulham school. He was as engaging as Ferenc Puskas, whose poor English was no obstacle to the warmth he displayed to everyone who came to greet him. My one regret is the offer we turned down for Desert Orchid. It would have been a huge feat of salesmanship to flog hoofprints on the internet. The best of them were like pilgrimages, with people keen to express how much the sportsman had meant to them and it cannot have been much of a hardship to sit there and soak up the flattery. The cricketers tended to be the nicest people and often former players would drop in to have a chat or a glass of wine with whoever was signing \u2013 Hallam Moseley came in to see his former Somerset colleague Ian Botham and Rahul Dravid turned up to see Mark Waugh. One suspects Blair will not have too many of his old ministers rushing to see him but he should still find it a rewarding experience in more ways than one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
