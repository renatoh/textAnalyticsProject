But the country\u2019s Indian community has decried as racist a recent policy change that excludes \u2013 perhaps permanently \u2013 those entering arranged marriages from bringing their spouses to New Zealand. It has also created a political tangle a year out from New Zealand\u2019s elections \u2013 with one minister claiming the government had not been responsible for the immigration clampdown \u2013 and another claiming it as a personal victory. While a couple does not need to be married in order to be reunited on a partnership visa in New Zealand, partners must prove they have lived together for 12 months. Officials had previously waived that requirement for those in special cultural circumstances \u2013 such as people entering arranged marriages, often from India, who had not lived together before their weddings. But in May, the cultural exemptions suddenly stopped, and those with did not meet the requirements were refused visas to New Zealand. The Indian community said it was discrimination; on Sunday, in the largest city, Auckland, protesters rallied against the decision. A lawmaker from the populist minor party, New Zealand First, in October threw fuel on the fire, telling Indians they should leave New Zealand if they did not like its immigration policies. Shane Jones, who told Radio New Zealand the Indian community had \u201cno legitimate expectations in my view to bring your whole village to New Zealand\u201d, was speaking about tighter rules for bringing parents to the country. For the Indian community, it added insult to injury. \u201cWhat they are demanding is not possible within Indian culture. They\u2019re expecting us to be living together in the same house, to have a proper married life together before getting married,\u201d said Ankur Shokeen, 27. He and his wife had chosen each other after meeting several prospective partners arranged by their parents. A visa application for his wife, Neha, 27, was declined in September, on the basis that the couple had not spent enough time together; he had returned to New Zealand for work following the wedding. \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone who has been in that kind of relationship in India,\u201d he said of New Zealand\u2019s rule change. \u201cIt\u2019s not acceptable in Indian culture, it\u2019s been the culture for thousands of years.\u201d Shokeen said he struggled to understand how, with only four weeks of paid leave a year, he could spend more time in India with his wife. His employer had permitted six weeks off for his wedding, but that had been an act of generosity and Shokeen, who has lived in New Zealand since he was 18, did not want to ask for more. Confused about why officials could not accept his marriage was genuine \u2013 a playlist of public YouTube videos portray every aspect of his wedding day \u2013 he could only conclude they did not understand cultural matters. \u201cIt has been hard, but I\u2019m really lucky \u2013 I\u2019m hearing other people\u2019s stories and they\u2019re having trouble between the partners due to these delays,\u201d Shokeen said, adding that many Indian friends \u2013 including citizens of New Zealand \u2013 had received the same letters, verbatim, declining their spouses\u2019 requests. Many in the Indian community believe New Zealand\u2019s centre-left Labour coalition government is responsible for the change, as part of a wider directive to enforce immigration rules and reduce fraudulent applications. But immigration minister Iain Lees-Galloway told Newsroom he agreed with the criticism \u2013 and that he was not responsible for the change. A spokesperson for the minister confirmed Lees-Galloway had asked the immigration agency to revisit its interpretation of the rules, but said it was an operational matter and he could not tell the agency what to do. In contradiction to the minister\u2019s disavowal, Winston Peters, the New Zealand First leader and deputy prime minister, claimed responsibility for the changes. \u201cHas New Zealand First had an influence on trying to tidy up the quality of information on which the immigration department relies?\u201d he told RNZ in October. \u201cThe answer is profoundly yes.\u201d An Immigration New Zealand spokesperson said the agency was considering its approach to culturally arranged marriages, and was \u201caware of the concerns\u201d raised by the Indian community."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
