The England manager was speaking frankly at a press conference at the squad's base in Leicestershire after stating that he had no reason to be upset that Steven Gerrard had a potential move from Liverpool to Chelsea on his mind at Euro 2004. \"If you are a professional football player it must be your right to listen if some other work is available,\" Eriksson said. \"We are not living in a dictatorship, we are living in a democracy. I think that's important.\" He then seemed to realise the implications of what he had said and added: \"I don't want to comment on Ashley Cole, Arsenal or Chelsea. Right or wrong. I might have an opinion on that but I will never tell you.\" None the less, Eriksson seemed indifferent to football's contractual system. Players, in theory, are prohibited from negotiating a transfer unless they are allowed to do so by their club or are within six months of the end of their current deal. Eriksson made no mention of any need for permission to be granted. The manager refused to discuss the specifics of Cole's case. A Premier League inquiry will look into the allegation that Chelsea, in the form of their chief executive Peter Kenyon, manager Jose Mourinho and the agent Pini Zahavi held a meeting with the Arsenal full-back and his own agent Jonathan Barnett over a possible move to Stamford Bridge. However, it is discomfiting for the FA and its new chief executive, Brian Barwick, that Eriksson hardly seemed to consider the regulations. The FA said yesterday that it had no comment to make, as did Arsenal and Chelsea. Even so, the Swede ensured that he will not be accused of inconsistency or hypocrisy. It was the reports of his visit to Kenyon's house early last year, when he was thought to be on the verge of becoming the Premiership club's manager, that led the FA to move quickly and agree a new, \u00a33.5m-a-year contract. Back then, Eriksson argued: \"I think that I have human rights to listen to other clubs. You can never convince me I shouldn't have that right. I haven't let anyone down by listening to anyone else. If some people think that's disloyal, I'm sorry about that. But to have this job is not just about sitting there, year after year, waiting to be sacked. \"You must have ambitions in life and, if something interesting comes up, then you listen to it - even if you are the England manager.\" While Eriksson was being realistic in his comments yesterday since clubs cannot be prevented in practice from making contact, by one means or another, with players they wish to buy, it would have been better for the FA had he not aired his opinions at so delicate a moment. Eriksson did, however, say that he was confident the row over alleged \"tapping\" would not distract Cole ahead of the Holland game, even though the defender could find himself in a difficult situation. \"If I should give him any advice, it would be to concentrate on football and not read newspapers,\" Eriksson said. \"But I'm not worried. He was one of the best on the pitch in training on Monday. I've known him for many years and I've never had a problem with him on or off the pitch, and it's the same now.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
