Sports reporters scrambling to find a worse defeat for an Italian side in European competition needed to go back to Juventus's 7-0 humbling at the hands of Austria's Wiener SK in 1958. \"I do not recall such an apocalyptic quarter-final or such a devastating first half,\" wrote La Stampa's Roberto Beccantini, adding that Roma were \"stunned, then swept away, then destroyed, then humiliated.\" Looking ahead, La Repubblica worried what Cristiano Ronaldo, scorer of two goals on Wednesday night at Old Trafford, might unleash on the \"dinosaurs\" in the Milan defence were he to confront them in the semi-final. Contending with Ronaldo's dribbling, the Roma players \"looked like car-sick kids who vomit their elevenses at the first sharp curve\", the paper wrote. Francesco Totti, christened \"Captain Disaster\" by La Gazzetta Dello Sport and accused by La Repubblica of going missing on big nights, described it as the saddest night of his life. \"Describing each goal would just be sadistic,\" wrote Corriere della Sera, going on to quote the Roma coach, Luciano Spalletti, who was rather less reticent. \"Every shot finished in the back of the net,\" he said incredulously, adding: \"What would I change if I could do it again? Stay at home.\" La Stampa saved some of its most dramatic prose for the pre-match crowd disturbances outside Old Trafford, likening the travelling Roma supporters to the 300 Spartans at Thermopylae, facing drunken Manchester United fans resembling \"a million Persians\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
