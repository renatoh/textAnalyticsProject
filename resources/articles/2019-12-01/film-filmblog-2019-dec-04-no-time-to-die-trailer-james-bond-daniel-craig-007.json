There is a weird lack of excitement about the instalment arriving next April, partly down to how immensely boring Spectre was, and partly down to Daniel Craig\u2019s reluctance to ever star in a James Bond film ever again. If even 007 doesn\u2019t want to be 007 any more, we\u2019re all in for trouble. So the No Time to Die trailer is the Bond franchise\u2019s big chance to show that it can still compete. In a world where people only watch Disney movies, how are we going to cope with the further adventures of a posh British drunk with a limp? There\u2019s only one thing to do: dive into the trailer. Let\u2019s start with the good news: the No Time to Die trailer opens with Craig doing more acting than he has in the last three Bond films combined. Look at his face \u2013 that\u2019s anger, an identifiable emotion. Better yet, he\u2019s in the car having an argument with L\u00e9a Seydoux. This is perfect news for anyone who\u2019s ever wished they were the children trapped in James Bond and Madeleine Swann\u2019s loveless marriage. However, that first shot appears to be nothing more than sizzle. Now we\u2019re treated to what seems to be the opening scene of the film itself. \u201cWhere\u2019s 007?\u201d asks M impatiently, before we cut to the most incredible and remote lake-house known to man. What an idyllic holiday spot for Bond \u2013 no wonder he isn\u2019t answering the call any more. He must be having the time of his life. No, as it turns out, James Bond hates lakes. You wouldn\u2019t think it was possible for someone to hate lakes as much as he does, but here we are. It\u2019s a shame this will be Daniel Craig\u2019s final outing as 007, because there goes my brilliant idea to give Bond 26 the title Lakepuncher. \u201cThe world\u2019s moved on, Commander Bond\u201d says Lashana Lynch. She\u2019s the newest 00 on the block, and she means business. Yes, every Bond girl for the last 50 years has said something along the lines of \u201cThe world has moved on\u201d to demonstrate the franchise\u2019s understanding of social progressiveness. And, yes, James Bond has almost exclusively responded to this by aggressively skirting the lines of sexual consent with them in the very next scene. She\u2019ll be fine, this one. She\u2019ll definitely be fine. Hey, it\u2019s Christoph Waltz! You forgot he was a Bond baddie, didn\u2019t you? Well here he is again, only horribly disfigured to prove that he\u2019s evil. He\u2019s here to tell James Bond that Dr Madeleine Swann has a secret. This is why Bond was so angry at her in the car. He left the service for her, and she broke his heart. Here we are in the middle of the heartbreak, as Bond slowly realises he junked his entire career for a woman who actually wanted to go on holiday to wherever they shot Mamma Mia. We still haven\u2019t met the Big Bad for this film yet, have we? Here\u2019s a hint: he wears too much makeup and he\u2019s apparently hiding behind the front door that your granny had in 1987. Just kidding, here he is. It\u2019s Rami Malek from Mr Robot, dressed in the anorak that your granny had in 1987. He\u2019s definitely the baddie, by the way. You can tell by how horribly disfigured he is. Remember kids, facial disfigurement means evil. It always means evil. Finally, here\u2019s Bond being shot at in a car for no reason. I hate that I\u2019m excited about this stupid film."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
