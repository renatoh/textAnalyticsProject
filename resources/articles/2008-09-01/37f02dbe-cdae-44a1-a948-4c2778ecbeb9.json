The output of the others were clearly defined - pop for kids on Radio 1, light music for older listeners on 2, classical for highbrows on 3 - but Radio 4 was stuck with trying to please everyone with a mishmash of speech programmes, and had a stuffy image inherited from the old Home Service. Life on Air adroitly traces how successive controllers developed its identity, finding a third way between warring internal forces (populists v intellectuals, news carnivores v fiction and features herbivores) and seeing off plans that threatened the network's viability: to merge it with local radio, for example, or reallocate Today and other key shows to a rolling news station. Equally deft is the way Hendy moves between overall strategy and the work of particular production departments. And, as on Radio 4 itself, there's a measured allowance of fun, mostly derived from disasters such as Up to the Hour, Rollercoaster and Anderson Country."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
