In 1967, when I was 16, my uncle and aunt invited me on a trip through Mexico. That trip was seminal for me in gaining an interest in Latin America and travel in general. We spent a month riding horses in the mountains and visiting remote Indian villages. I loved the handicrafts and folk art that we saw along the way and I loaded up our car with boxes of hand-blown glass or painted ceramic. I then worked on an archaeological excavation with my cousin in the ruins of pyramids outside Mexico City. There was just something about that experience that made me want to continue travelling. I just had to figure out a way. When did you next manage to travel? I majored in Latin American studies and decided to visit all the countries I'd studied. In 1974 I visited Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia. I remember buying a hand-woven tapestry from a guy in a plaza in Colombia and made a point of going to museums that had handicraft exhibitions. I thought maybe this is what I'll do: buy and sell handicrafts. I was always interested in music too, but it was never my aim to seek out music. How did this translate into a world music record label? I opened a little shop - Putumayo - on the Upper East Side in Manhattan selling folk art in 1975. It became known for crafts and arts and then clothes inspired by traditional cultures. By 1987 I had seven stores in New York, Washington and Boston. The music label happened coincidentally. I'd always brought back music from Bolivia and Peru, mostly Indian flute music, which I'd play in the shops between Bob Dylan and Van Morrison and the label grew out of that. Has music always played a part in your travels? I've been to at least 50 countries now and I've always asked people I've met about artists they would recommend. Sometimes you simply have to buy a cassette in the market or in a restaurant in India ask the sitar player what he is playing. I went to Africa twice, to Cape Verde and Senegal, to research albums and found a lot of music in the Cape Verde communities of Paris, Lisbon and Massachusetts. In Afghanistan I saw the most exotic instruments and brought some back to the States. My travels have been about a curiosity in folk art and music and now I go to a lot of the festivals around Europe, such as Womad. For me, Putumayo is the nexus between music, culture and travel. Have you had any feedback from listeners? A big part of what we do is get people to take that first step. The news, especially from Latin America and Africa, is about Aids, civil war and poverty. All the bad stuff. Yet out of these cultures comes incredible art, music, crafts, film. Putumayo tries to be an introduction to other cultures and helps you travel. I get great pleasure when I receive emails from people saying: 'I bought your Mali to Memphis album and it inspired me to take a trip to Mali.' I think that's the most encouraging thing when we serve as an introduction to an artist or a country or culture. They read a little about a place and hopefully their next step will be to travel. Where's next for you to visit? Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union and parts of east Africa. Kenya and Tanzania have so little music represented in the West and there's some great music there, they love their Swahili hip-hop. \u00b7 Dan Storper is founder and chief executive officer of Putumayo. 'Acoustic Brazil' and 'New Orleans' are released in February and March."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
