David Cameron faces acute embarrassment for allowing the company, Rosoboronexport, to promote its military aircraft at the Farnborough International Airshow. Cameron, who will announce a \u00a31.1bn package of spending on UK defence capabilities at the biennial arms fair ,on Monday, has called for military action against al-Assad's \"brutal and sickening\" killing of civilians. Government representatives said they had discouraged Russian attendance at the show and it had not issued any invitations to Russian representatives after military cooperation was suspended following the conflict in Ukraine. But a spokesman insisted the exhibitors at the event remained a \"commercial matter\" for the organisers. Vince Cable, business secretary, Michael Fallon, business minister, David Willetts, science minister, and Philip Hammond, defence secretary, are due to speak at or attend the show. On Monday, Cameron will announce the cash for the \"vital\" Ministry of Defence programmes, including an extra \u00a3800m of investment in an intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance package, which includes unmanned aircraft. A spokesman for the Campaign Against Arms Trade said: \"Assad's main weapons supplier and Israeli arms manufacturers, advertising their 'battle-tested' wares, will all attend. Instead of seeking to limit their activities, the government will provide them with a platform to do business and will invite military buyers from other brutal regimes to peruse their wares.\" According to the Rosoboronexport website, the company is \"the exclusive state intermediary, entitled to supply the world market with the whole range of permitted arms exports and military equipment made by the enterprises of the military-industrial complex of Russia\". Rosoboronexport has provided the Syrian government with the bulk of the tanks, fighters , missiles and helicopters used in a civil war that has claimed more than 170,000 lives, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. US senators reported that Rosoboronexport supplied nearly $1bn (\u00a3580m) worth of arms to Syria in 2011, including high-explosives, mortars, sniper rifles, ammunition and attack helicopters which could have been used by Assad's forces to kill civilians. Anatoly Isaikin, Rosoboronexport's chief executive, said last year, that the company would continue to supply weapons to Syria. \"In the absence of sanctions, we continue to fulfil our contract obligations [to supply weapons to Syria],\" he said. \"But these aren't offensive weapons. We are mostly shipping air defence systems and repair equipment intended for various branches of the military.\" A letter from the Syrian army high command to Rosoboronexportin Moscow, appears to show the Assad regime ordered thousands of Kalashnikov assault rifles, machine guns, grenade launchers and ammunition as recently as March 2013. The letter was leaked to Human Rights Watch. Sergei Kornev, head of Rosoboronexport's delegation, said the company would use the Farnborough Airshow to sell its fighter jets and combat helicopters. \"We traditionally take part in this prestigious airshow and try to present the very latest and most promising export models there,\" he said. \"Presentations of military helicopters and aeroplanes are planned for delegations from the Middle East, Latin America and South East Asia.\" The company said it expects \"keen interest\" in its Su-35 multirole jet fighters and Kamov Ka-50 attack helicopters. Britain's defence industry is also concerned about the presence of Rosoboronexport at Farnborough. A senior executive at one of the country's biggest defence firms said: \"They will all be there, the Russians, the Chinese. It is inappropriate for them to be there alongside reputable companies that are very concerned about where there products end up.\" A government spokesman said: \"Farnborough International Airshow is a commercial event run by Farnborough International Ltd. The government plays no part in determining which companies are invited to exhibit. It is a commercial matter for the organisers to whom they sell exhibition space. \"Her Majesty's government suspending military cooperation with Russia following their actions in Ukraine has meant no representatives of the Russian government will be issued with HMG invitations to Farnborough Air Show 2014.\" A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: \"The UK works hard to curb the ability of both the Syrian regime and extremist groups to acquire the weaponry with which they deliver death and destruction. The UK would support an arms embargo that helps us in these aims: stopping weapons ending up in the hands of the Assad regime and terrorists. \"Her Majesty's government has also taken clear action to remove Russia from the list of countries eligible to use open general export licences, in order to discourage Russian attendance at Farnborough International Airshow 2014.\" Shaun Ormrod, chief executive of Farnborough International, said it was not up to the organisers to police the show. \"We are an international trade show,\" he said. \"We have a large number of Russian companies. As long as it is condoned by the government of the day we do not take a view on who is appropriate to display at the show.\" US senators have called on the US government to end all ties with Rosobornoexport. \"Rosoboronexport is an arm of the Russian government and a powerful instrument of [Russian President] Vladimir Putin's increasingly belligerent foreign policy,\" a group of 10 bipartisan senators said in a letter to President Obama in March.
