The Worcester prop is one of only five players registered to Premiership clubs who were born in the 1960s. He started his senior career at Gloucester as an 18-year-old and is still playing top-flight rugby as many years on, one of the exceptions to the theory that the physical demands of the modern game are shortening players' time at the top. He shows no signs of slowing down as he approaches his 37th birthday: he took over the captaincy of the Warriors last month when Pat Sanderson was on England duty and is an integral part of one of the strongest scrummaging units in the country. Windo will sit down with his family for Christmas dinner making only minor concessions to festive spirit with Bath visiting Sixways the following day. \"I will have some turkey and wear one of those paper hats,\" he said. \"There will be a few Christmases left after I have retired when I can properly indulge like everyone else. \"The sacrifices are worth it: rugby may be a totally different sport compared to when I started playing but I find it just as enjoyable. The emphasis is still the same: the team. We bonded as a squad in the old days in ways which would be unacceptable now - Boxing Day derbies tended to start slowly as players sweated the booze out of their systems, for example - but you do not have to go on drinking sessions to enjoy each other's company.\" Windo served his apprenticeship in Gloucester's reserves, spending many a wet Wednesday evening travelling to Wales and a meeting with toecaps and knuckles. \"It was hard but there was no better way to learn. One of my early games was against Pontypool and I found Graham Price marking me. He must have been 40, well past the time he had played for Wales and the Lions, but it was a full-on battle. You found out about the finer arts in Wales and a fair bit of skulduggery went on: we played at Newport once and one of their second-rows sent through a punch at a scrum which landed on the jaw of one of his own front-rowers and shattered it. You had to stand up for yourself and your team-mates and you were all friends in the clubhouse.\" Windo was born and bred in Gloucester, standing in the Shed at Kingsholm. He spent 12 years with the club and when he joined Worcester, having turned 30 and made more than 200 appearances for the Cherry and Whites, it was assumed stepping down a division was a prelude to his return to the social game. But he has always been driven by ambition. \"I felt it was the time to leave Gloucester,\" he said. \"I expected to be back in the Premiership with Worcester after 12 months but it took us four years to get promotion. When I was growing up, Gloucester were renowned for developing their own players. Now they are cosmopolitan like any other side and they do not have many local boys in the forwards. It is how the professional game has evolved but it is not the club I joined.\" Windo has played a formative part in transforming Worcester from a club that barely incited a flicker of consciousness in rugby circles into one which, on the evidence of the first half of the season, has every chance of realising the dream of their chairman and benefactor Cecil Duckworth and playing in next season's Heineken Cup. Worcester have not lost a league match at home this season and only one all year, in March when Saracens pipped them by a point. \"Joining Worcester was a career move for me,\" said Windo. \"I knew the club was ambitious and getting into the Premiership was only a matter of time. We have made a reasonable start to the league season and people are making some predictions about where we will finish but I don't like to look beyond the next game. What we have at Sixways is an excellent set-up, a crowd which is far larger and significantly more partisan than it was even a couple of years ago, a squad of players who get on well with each other and a chairman who has invested in his ambition. People go on about my retirement far more than I do. As long as I am enjoying my rugby and the club feels I'm worth my place, I will carry on. \"I have been lucky with injuries. Fitness and strength levels have improved out of all recognition in the past 10 years and it is becoming a young man's game. I am at an age when you have to think about life after rugby: I was a warehouse manager in the amateur days and was training to be a dental technician when professionalism started but I intend to make the most of what is left of my playing career. \"I don't want to be thought of as someone who's hanging around to become the oldest player in the Premiership. I am not the flashiest player in the world but I will always give it everything. I know I will miss rugby when it is time to go. There is still fun in the game and it is still about eight forwards working together for each other, easily worth a quiet Christmas.\" Born in the 60s Gareth Llewellyn Bristol, second row Age 36 Born February 27 1969 Rob Hardwick London Irish, prop Age 36 Born March 29 1969 Tony Windo Worcester, prop Age 36 Born April 30 1969 Luke Gross Newcastle, second row Age 36 Born November 21 1969 Neil Hatley London Irish, prop Age 36 Born December 23 1969"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
