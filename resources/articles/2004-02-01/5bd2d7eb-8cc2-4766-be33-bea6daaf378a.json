Mr Murdoch, who is no stranger to the merits of combining a distribution company with a programme-making operation, said it would create a \"third player\" alongside Time Warner and News Corp. The media mogul said the possible arrival of another \"vertically integrated\" media company would not bring major change for his company, one of only two that has developed both content and distribution businesses. Comcast's \u00a337bn offer for Disney would create a media giant that served nearly a quarter of US pay-TV subscribers and give the cable company control of Disney studios, ABC TV and the ESPN sports network. \"I don't think it changes much,\" Mr Murdoch said today, speaking from Italy. \"You have got big vertical integration at Time Warner and with us and you will have a third player. We certainly would not be making a run at Disney.\" Those who follow News Corp closely say that Mr Murdoch believes the only survivors in the future will be those who control distribution networks. They say this was why he was so determined to buy the satellite TV operation DirecTV even though it is a relatively small player in the US with just 11% of the market. Comcast is by far the largest distributor of TV in the US with 21.4 million subscribers - 23% of the total market - followed by Time Warner with 12% of the market. Mr Murdoch said any deal tying Disney to Comcast was unlikely to affect the distribution deals his content businesses struck with Comcast. \"We will have just as much ability to pressure them as them us,\" he said. Comcast's bid for Disney came out of the blue today. It emerged the company had made a secret approach to Disney chief executive, Michael Eisner, for merger talks but decided to go public and appeal directly to shareholders when it was snubbed. The company has been eyeing content businesses for some time. Last year Comcast tried to get its hands on Vivendi Universal's entertainment assets, but the French group ended up combining with US network NBC, which is owned by General Electric. News Corp runs the Fox film studios and TV network, while Time Warner - the world's biggest media company - owns the Warner film studios and cable channels CNN and HBO. In a news conference today, Mr Murdoch also said he would not be making any immediate moves to take advantage of the reported liberalisation of China's media laws allowing foreign companies to take minority stakes in production companies. \"I doubt we would be interested in the minority stakes,\" Mr Murdoch said. \"I'm not too sure what that story adds up to. \"We would prefer to start them [companies] ourselves. We will just see as we go along there. We would be happy to get wider distribution for our existing channels.\" Asked about his long time ally John Malone's decision to up his stake in News Corp to 9% of the company's voting rights, Mr Murdoch said it would not change his relationship with the Liberty Media boss \"in the least\". He said he did not expect Mr Malone to buy any more shares in News Corp in the short term, and said the cable tycoon had not asked for a seat on the company's board. Mr Murdoch said the advertising market worldwide was \"pretty healthy\" and said he was \"very pleased\" with the tabloid edition of The Times, launched last year. \"We are very pleased with it, but there's a long way to go. It's a pretty young product.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
