The Times\u2019 headline reads \u201cPM in intensive care\u201d and reports on sources saying that Johnson needed four litres of oxygen. The papers says this is well below the normal threshold of 15 litres and suggests the prime minister\u2019s case is not as serious as some admitted to ICU. The Guardian\u2019s splash headline is \u201cJohnson taken to intensive care after virus symptoms worsen\u201d. Simon Jenkins, one of the paper\u2019s columnists, wishes Johnson a speedy recovery but says that we must recognise that \u201cthe machinery of government is malfunctioning\u201d in his absence. The Mirror says \u201cSick Boris faces fight for life\u201d across a picture of a pallid-looking Johnson taken from a government video last week. It agrees that the PM\u2019s illness \u201craises some awkward questions\u201d for the way the country is being run and says cabinet ministers will never be forgiven if they are seen to be scoring points off each other in a fight for a potential succession. The Mail also chooses the same image as the Mirror alongside a headline reading \u201cNow stricken Boris taken to intensive care\u201d. It also notes that his pregnant girlfriend, Carrie Symonds, is self-isolating in London and has been unable to see him. The Mail reports inside on how \u201cthe crisis over Boris Johnson\u2019s health turned into a full-scale emergency\u201d, with his doctor immediately telling him he had to go to hospital after seeing him struggling for breath on a conference call on Sunday. The Sun headline says \u201cBoris in intensive care\u201d while the Metro says \u201cPM put in intensive care unit\u201d and the i opts for \u201cPrime minister in intensive care with coronavirus\u201d. The Telegraph headline is \u201cJohnson in intensive care\u201d and on the inside pages the paper\u2019s former editor, Charles Moore, is sharply critical of comments by the one-time Whitehall mandarin Lord Kerslake, who told the BBC that Johnson would have to \u201creflect on his position\u201d if his illness continued. Citing the example of Winston Churchill, who suffered two bouts of serious illness during the second world war, Moore looks forward to Johnson recovering and says: \u201cI think both Britain and Boris have a stronger constitution than Lord Kerslake allows.\u201d The Express, whose headline is \u201cBoris moved to intensive care as health worsens\u201d, highlights in one of its stories a comment by BBC journalist Andrew Neil who posted on Twitter a statistic about the dangers of the virus if you have not recovered after 10 days. The BBC host wrote: \u201cThis virus either gives up and you recover with no damage done or it really decides to go for you and you have a 50:50 chance. The PM\u2019s decision to work through his isolation will not have helped. Nor loneliness in Downing St.\u201d Finally, the Financial Times says \u201cJohnson moved to intensive care as persistent symptoms worsen\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
