Less than a week to go and the big questions are whether Boris Johnson can bear to face a grilling from BBC veteran (and the prime minister\u2019s former Spectator boss) Andrew Neil, and how the main party leaders will fare in tonight\u2019s BBC debate. We have the best of other news, including a potentially problematic exchange involving Joe Biden on the campaign trail. What\u2019s going on? Neil has thrown down the gauntlet to Johnson, challenging him to a BBC interview. The prime minister has so far failed to commit \u2013 making him the only leader of a major party not to have faced the presenter during the campaign. At the end of his interview with Nigel Farage last night Neil turned to the camera and addressed an audience of millions about Johnson\u2019s failure to take part. \u201cWe have been asking him for weeks now to give us a date, a time, a venue. As of now, none has been forthcoming,\u201d he said, adding that the prime minister\u2019s attendance at the interview was \u201ca question of trust\u201d. Last night Jeremy Corbyn gave an interview in which ITV\u2019s Julie Etchingham sought to uncover \u201cjust who is Jeremy Corbyn?\u201d Marina Hyde has some opinions about how that went. (Johnson has also declined to do a sit-down with Etchingham.) Johnson will at least be appearing on television tonight, to debate Corbyn at a forum in Southampton chaired by the former BBC political editor Nick Robinson. It is set to be the last time the leaders face off before Britain goes to the polls. Expect questions about the handling of the London Bridge attack, after Corbyn told the Guardian that he felt the prime minister had politicised the deaths of two people. \u201cI think he did far too much,\u201d said the Labour leader. At a glance Brexit has been \u201cone of the most spectacular mistakes\u201d in the history of the EU, Donald Tusk has said in his first interview since standing down as European council president last week. At least four ministers, including Sajid Javid, have gone on election campaigning trips to endorse Tory candidates facing allegations of Islamophobia since the claims against them came to light, the Guardian has learned. Farage has hit out at the three MEPs, including Annunziata Rees-Mogg \u2013 sister of the Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg \u2013 who have abandoned his Brexit party just seven days before polling day. A thinktank has called the Tory, Labour and Lib Dem spending promises on education either over-ambitious or misdirected. A Conservative parliamentary candidate has been criticised for being paid \u00a325,000 a year to head up a university thinktank that does not yet exist. Labour has held the seat of Wrexham since 1935 but old political certainties have all but disappeared, writes Steven Morris as part of our People and Power series. You think you know about politics, but could you cut it as a returning officer? Take our quiz to find out. The day ahead The big event tonight is Johnson and Corbyn\u2019s election debate in Southhampton, which will be broadcast on the BBC. Johnson is expected to make a speech in Kent before the debate. Corbyn will kick off the day by holding a press conference in London about a subject that had not yet been revealed at time of writing. Jo Swinson will travel to Hampshire to spend time with a playgroup and speak to working parents about the party\u2019s childcare plans. In Scotland the Lib Dems are going for the gimmick and will visit a bakery to challenge the SNP\u2019s \u201chalf-baked\u201d plan for a second referendum. For the Brexit party, Farage, Ann Widdecombe and Gregory Butt, a retired colonel and the parliamentary candidate for Hyndburn in Lancashire, will unveil the party\u2019s defence and veterans policy at a press conference in London. Nicola Sturgeon will be interviewed on This Morning on ITV. Sign up here to receive Andrew Sparrow\u2019s afternoon round-up from the campaign trail \u2013 direct to your email inbox. Best of the rest &gt; Indian police have shot dead four men who were accused of gang-raping and murdering a young vet, then burning her corpse. There had been calls for the men\u2019s lynching after their arrest for the alleged premeditated attack in Hyderabad. According to police, the accused were taking part in a reconstruction of the crime when they tried to snatch officers\u2019 guns and were shot. Police gave contradictory details concerning the events. The rape victim\u2019s family welcomed the news but the All India Progressive Women\u2019s association said it was \u201ccounterfeit justice\u201d that proved police were unable to protect women and bring perpetrators to proper justice. &gt; Joe Biden has called a heckler a \u201cdamn liar\u201d \u2013 and seemingly also \u201cfat\u201d \u2013 during a campaign event in Iowa. The man aired discredited claims about Biden, his son Hunter and Ukraine, and challenged Biden as too old to be president. The former vice-president snapped back: \u201cYou want to check my shape, man, let\u2019s do pushups together here, man. Let\u2019s run. Let\u2019s do whatever you want to do. Let\u2019s take an IQ test. OK?\u201d The suggestion was met with applause from the audience. Biden said he was actually saying \u201cfact\u201d when people thought he called the man fat. Other attendees rounded on the heckler with one telling him to \u201cget out of here\u201d. &gt; The Eddie Stobart transport business is on the brink of collapse, with its future due to be decided at a key shareholder vote in London today that will pit William Stobart, the third son of the company\u2019s founder, against his childhood friend and former brother-in-law, Andrew Tinkler. If their competing bids fall through, the company, which employs 6,500 people, could collapse under the weight of a huge debt pile months before its 50th birthday. The Warrington-based haulier recorded a loss of at least \u00a312m in the first half of the financial year.

Lunchtime read: The bedsit Nazi and the killing of Jo Cox Jo Cox was the first female MP to be murdered in Britain, and the first MP killed since Ian Gow was murdered by the IRA in 1990 \u2013 but all we knew of Thomas Mair\u2019s motivation were the slogans he shouted as he carried out his attack: \u201cThis is for Britain\u201d or \u201cBritain first\u201d and even \u201cMake Britain independent\u201d. Kester Aspden wrote to Mair directly a few weeks after his trial, when he was in Frankland prison. \u201cSome weeks later, a letter arrived from the prison where Mair said he was being held \u2018IN SEGREGATION \u2018FOR MY OWN PROTECTION\u2019.\u2019 He wrote in black biro, using capitals throughout. The further three pages of thoughts Mair said he had composed for me had been blocked by the censor. \u2018I AM AT A LOSS TO SEE HOW WE CAN HAVE A \u2018DIALOGUE\u2019,\u2019 Mair wrote, \u2018\u2026 I DON\u2019T KNOW IF EVEN THIS SHORT NOTE WILL MAKE IT PASS [sic] THE CENSOR.\u2019 The police highlighted Brexit as \u2018a motivating factor\u2019 for Mair and the murder of Cox soon became part of the post-vote battleground. Boris Johnson has dismissed fears about inflammatory talk as \u2018humbug\u2019, but the example of Jo Cox\u2019s killing has been used in a number of threatening letters sent to pro-remain \u2013 especially female \u2013 politicians. Three years on, the atmosphere is still full of aggression and mutual recrimination.\u201d Sport Duncan Ferguson has been placed in temporary charge of Everton after Farhad Moshiri made Marco Silva his fourth managerial sacking in under four years.
