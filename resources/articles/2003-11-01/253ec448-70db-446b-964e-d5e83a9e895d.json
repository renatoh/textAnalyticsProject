Between the birth of the scientist Erasmus Darwin in 1731 and the publication of The Origin of Species by his grandson Charles in 1859, Britain, a country with very little tradition of creativity in the visual arts, produced a homegrown painting of spectacular brilliance. It was unexpected, startling - and an aspect of the scientific revolution. The first truly British contribution to visual art (early great artists in Britain had been foreigners at court: Holbein, Van Dyck, Rubens) was not art at all but a scientific publication: Sir Isaac Newton's Opticks in 1704. Newton's postulation of a seven-colour spectrum influenced European art more than any single British artist ever did. In Britain itself, Newtonian science created the cultural climate for intensely observational, scientific drawing and painting, in which there was no difference between the researches of painters and those of physicists and naturalists. Both relied on observation, and in 18th- and 19th-century Britain observation became a national obsession. A treatise on painting, published in 1740, urges the British landscape painter to systematically illustrate Newton: \"The Laws of Light and Colours, which, properly speaking, produce all the various Phaenomena of the visible World, would afford an inexhaustible fund of the most agreeable entertainment.\" Today we find the idea that art should imitate science troubling. It seems to rob art of art. Marc Quinn, famous for making a replica of his own head in blood, created a portrait of the geneticist Sir John Sulston by cloning Sulston's DNA in bacteria then growing it to the point of a marginal visibility - a challenge to our belief that art should add to the scientific facts. But this is exactly the kind of radical synthesis of art and science that was meat and drink to British painters in the Enlightenment. Joseph Wright of Derby's An Experiment on a Bird in the Air-Pump, painted in 1768, today in the National Gallery, is the ultimate document of this scientifically minded visual culture. Newtonian in its ruthlessly focused rational light, the painting depicts something shocking and sensational: a Frankensteinian experiment. A cockatoo, sealed inside a glass chamber, is being gradually deprived of air by a pump, as the long-haired, slightly manic lecturer proposes to demonstrate the existence of a vacuum. In a vessel brightly lit in the foreground, organic matter floats. The moment is portrayed by Wright as one of mystery, danger and outrage. A little girl is weeping to see the bird so cruelly used while her father tries to explain the value of the demonstration; the scientist addresses us, looking at us as if to invite us to make the choice: should the air pump be cranked up a notch, producing knowledge and killing the cockatoo? Damien Hirst's Turner prize-winning exhibit from 1995, Mother and Child, Divided, was his most explicit elision of art and science, insisting on the value of cutting things open and looking inside. The original artist-scientist, Leonardo da Vinci, doubted that many people would have the courage and self-discipline to emulate his own dissections of the human body, because \"though possessed of an interest in the subject you may perhaps be deterred by natural repugnance, or if this does not restrain you then perhaps by the fear of passing the night in the company of these corpses, quartered and flayed, and horrible to behold.\" Leonardo's anatomical drawings, specifically his drawing The Infant in the Womb, are clearly alluded to by Mother and Child, Divided, in which a mature cow and a calf have both been sliced down the centre of their bodies from nose to tail. A feat of modern technological precision in itself, this becomes the horrific means by which - like Leonardo drawing the results of his dissections - Hirst can show us a hidden inner world. The four transparent tanks containing the four sections of the cow and calf are displayed so that you can walk between them, inspecting the details of their formaldehyde-preserved, blood-drained organs, white like tripe - well, some of it is tripe - pressed up against the glass so that it is flattened like a drawing. At the Turner show at the Tate in 1995, you had to queue to see inside the specimens. In Wright's painting and Hirst's vitrines, knowledge is both spectacular and cruel, won at the cost of the death of a living thing. At once rational and spine-chilling, they ask the same questions. Can you bear to look? Can you tear your eyes away? Curiosity compelled 18th-century British artists to dissect. George Stubbs did it most literally. Today Stubbs's painting of the racehorse Whistlejacket hangs in the National Gallery near Wright's Experiment, and there is the same acute sense of natural history as passion, obsession. Stubbs's paintings of horses - he also painted lions and giraffes - are cherished today as loving tributes to an animal that was at the heart of the favourite sports of 18th- and 19th-century Britain, hunting and racing. But Stubbs won his knowledge of the horse late at night amid stripped fetlocks, skinned hindquarters and other equine horrors. The reason he painted horses better than anyone, except Leonardo, is that he knew more about horses than almost anyone ever has, from the inside out. In 1766 Stubbs published his Anatomy of the Horse, a detailed visual record of a dissection from which Stubbs analyses the anatomy underlying this animal's beauty. Powerful, weighty, densely physical drawings reveal the structure of the horse's body. Stubbs's Anatomy is a document of natural history as much as art. Anatomy of the Horse was part of a culture of natural observation that penetrated British society. If Stubbs knew the horse more than his contemporaries, this knowledge was valued precisely because everyone knew something about the horse. Races were even more popular than public experiments, and there was no better opportunity to observe a great natural drama. In 1994 the British artist Mark Wallinger, shortlisted for the Turner prize in 1995, revisited this world when he purchased a horse that he raced under the name A Real Work of Art. Wallinger has also painted horses in the manner of Stubbs and even made a version of Whistlejacket as a unicorn. The most revealing of all British sporting scenes, however, is Johan Zoffany's Colonel Mordaunt's Cock-Match (c1784-6), showing a riotous crowd watching a fight between the favourite fighting bird of the Indian ruler of Oudh, Asaf-ud-daula, and a cock that his British guest Colonel John Mordaunt has imported from Britain. Breeding and variation, between cultures and species, are here studied in a painting of a sporting spectacle that is also a document of historical anthropology. To the 18th-century British, a cock-match was important enough for a fighting bird to be fetched between Britain and India. Animals were kept for sport and at the same time were there to be studied. It was in keeping with this culture of sporting curiosity that Charles Darwin observed the variation of species. Darwin kept and bred pigeons, and this was crucial to his development of the theory of evolution. His pigeon-fancying, as he relates it in The Origin of Species, is one of the strands of observation by which he concludes that life evolves in the struggle to survive. The culture of natural observation that gave birth to Darwin's revolutionary book fuelled the great age of British painting."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
