Morgan said the accusation in today's Daily Express that the controversial photographs were a \"set-up\" was a \"mendacious lie from start to finish\". The story, which appeared on the front page of today's Express, said the Mirror had told two Army whistleblowers their story would be worth a fortune if they had pictures to corroborate their claims that Iraqi prisoners were abused. Under the headline \"Fake torture: now we reveal the shameful truth\" the Express claimed the two soldiers had produced the controversial images, which appear to show British soldiers torturing an Iraqi prisoner, weeks after being told their story would be worth more money if they had photographic evidence. But Morgan dismissed the story as a \"complete fabrication\" and a \"ridiculous smear\". \"The Daily Express splash today is a complete fabrication, just a deliberate and mendacious lie from start to finish. I realise they don't really know how to handle anything that doesn't involve the words 'asylum' and 'house prices' down there, but to invent stories in this way is pathetic and embarrassing for the very few decent journalists left on the paper,\" he said. \"Last week the Express led on a hoax internet story that Michael Jackson had killed himself, which I thought at the time was their lowest moment yet. But today's ridiculous smear on the Mirror is just lamentable. I console myself with the thought that a) Nobody cares what the Express says any more and b) Nobody reads it.\" But as Morgan defends the paper's position, insiders admit the issue is that the paper does not know the origin of the pictures. \"The paper is fairly convinced that they are genuine but is not sure about the provenance of the pictures. Piers is putting on a brave face, but I don't think anyone can prove one way or the other whether they are genuine. We've just got the soldiers' story,\" said on senior journalist on the paper. Morgan's latest comments come amid mounting pressure on the Mirror over the authenticity of the pictures published at the weekend. The newspaper has stood by its story, insisting in a leader column today that \"the Mirror still believes the truth of the story and the pictures that substantiate them\". But today the Conservative leader, Michael Howard, called for its editor to resign if the photographs turn out to be fake. And an influential committee of MPs said today it would take an \"early opportunity\" to question Morgan, saying it was \"incumbent on the Daily Mirror to cooperate fully\" with its investigations into alleged mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners by British soldiers. The Commons defence committee deliberated for over an hour this afternoon over whether to call in Morgan, with some MPs reportedly expressing concern about providing the Mirror with further publicity. But despite their misgivings, the MPs said they wanted Morgan to appear \"to satisfy ourselves whether he and his staff have acted responsibly\". \"The fact remains that the damaging effects of these allegations, whether they are true or not, will continue to be felt. They risk placing our service personnel currently serving in Iraq in still greater danger. They risk making the job they are there to do even more difficult. We do not believe that this is an acceptable situation,\" the committee said in a statement this afternoon. \"We have decided that we will take an early opportunity to call the editor of the Daily Mirror to appear before us. This will give him a chance to substantiate his newspaper's allegations. It will enable us to satisfy ourselves whether he and his staff have acted responsibly in how they have handled this matter. We will hold this session in the context of our already announced inquiry into the continuing operations in Iraq.\" Speaking before the meeting began, Tory MP and committee member Crispin Blunt said Morgan should resign if the photographs turn out not to be genuine. \"These pictures have done a grave disservice to the nation. If they turn out not to be correct that would be a dreadful journalistic lapse and his position would be untenable,\" said Mr Blunt. John Ingham, the Express journalist whose byline appeared on the article, declined to comment, but a spokesman for the newspaper said: \"We're quite sure that by now everybody is used to the rantings of Piers Morgan. The Daily Express stands by its story.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
