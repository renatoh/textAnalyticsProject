Terry, who returns to Stamford Bridge to sit in the away dugout on Wednesday, joined Smith\u2019s backroom staff after retiring in 2018 and Lampard said he had never given thought to luring the former Chelsea captain from Villa. \u201cIt was never an option that was spoken about,\u201d the Chelsea manager said. \u201cI think John was very settled at Aston Villa. When I took the Derby job he was already on his own path and they got promoted in the summer. John was very comfortable there and working away. I had my team that I worked with here.\u201d Lampard, whose coaching team include Jody Morris, Eddie Newton, Joe Edwards and Chris Jones, was not surprised that Terry had not gone straight into management. \u201cEveryone has their own route. It\u2019s just a path he\u2019s chosen. It\u2019s working well alongside Dean at a very good club that he already had a link with from his final year playing there. We all have to start in our different ways and he\u2019s starting well. It\u2019s a good choice.\u201d Lampard, who is waiting to know Tammy Abraham\u2019s fitness after the striker missed the home defeat by West Ham with a hip injury on Saturday, explained why he chose not to gain experience as a No 2 before becoming Derby\u2019s manager last season. \u201cIt was just opportunity. I worked here at the academy and was working through my coaching badges and I jumped in and took the option to give it a go. I felt I was ready. \u201cIt was definitely a risk and it will always be a risk, whatever job you take in football, because the competition is so high. John going in at Aston Villa as assistant is a risk of some sort because we all want success and so do owners. Whatever route John takes, both of us will be taking risks all the time. How good we do our job, that will be the end factor.\u201d Lampard expects the court of arbitration for sport to announce its ruling on the appeal against a two\u2011window transfer ban \u201cvery soon\u201d. They are unable to make signings until February next year after they were found guilty by Fifa of breaking transfer regulations relating to minors. They were also fined \u00a3460,000 and failed to overturn the decision when presenting their case to an Fifa\u2019s appeals committee in April. Chelsea\u2019s case was heard by Cas last month and their hopes of making signings during the January transfer window rest on winning the appeal. If Lampard is able to make signings he could allow the forwards Olivier Giroud and Pedro to leave."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
