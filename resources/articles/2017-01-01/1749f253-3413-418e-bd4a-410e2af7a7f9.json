Thank you for reading and see you soon! Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state nominee, has said the United States is \u201cbetter served by being at that table\u201d of climate change talks \u201cthan leaving that table.\u201d Here\u2019s the exchange: Senator Tom Udall: In your capacity as CEO of Exxon Mobile, you praised the Paris agreement, noting that addressing climate change, I quote \u201crequires broad based practical solutions around the world\u201d. Do you personally believe that the overall national interests of the United States are better served by staying in the Paris agreement if so why, and if not, why not? Tillerson: \u201c...I think having a seat at the table to address this issue on a global basis, it is important. It\u2019s I think, 190 countries or thereabouts have signed on to begin to take action. I think we\u2019re better served by being at that table than leaving that table.

It says Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia has been \u201ccultivating, supporting and assisting Trump for at least five years\u201d. Moscow\u2019s aim is \u201cto encourage splits and divisions in the western alliance\u201d and to upend the \u201cideals-based international order\u201d set up after the second world war. Putin\u2019s preference, according to the report, is for a return to the \u201cGreat Power\u201d politics of the 19th century, where big states pursue their own interests. The dossier says that Trump was offered \u201cvarious sweetener business deals\u201d by the Kremlin, but turned them down. The Kremlin also supplied Trump with \u201ca regular flow of intelligence\u201d, including on the Democrats and other political rivals. Russian spies put together compromising dossiers on both Clinton and Trump, the dossier says. The Clinton one was innocuous and mostly included bugged conversations. The Trump material, by contrast, was explosive. It includes lurid details from Trump\u2019s visit in 2013 Moscow for the Miss Universe beauty pageant. According to the dossier, Trump stayed in the Ritz Carlton hotel, in the same suite used by Barack Obama. It says Russia\u2019s FSB spy agency obtained compromising sexual material \u2013 kompromat \u2013 from the hotel suite. \u201cFSB has compromised TRUMP through his activities in Moscow sufficiently to be able to blackmail him,\u201d it says. Is it true? No one could quibble with the report\u2019s section on geopolitics. It\u2019s undoubtedly true that Putin has sought to weaken western institutions and the transatlantic alliance, plus the EU. Over the past 16 years he has sought to re-establish Russia as an indispensable global player, and to challenge what Moscow sees as unfair US hegemony. The sex claims about Trump are ultimately unknowable and what happened inside the Ritz Carlton is a matter of speculation. Trump dismissed the report in its entirety at his press conference on Wednesday as \u201cfake news\u201d... Read further: At the Tillerson hearing, meanwhile, the secretary of state nominee does not tie a US commitment to Nato allies to membership dues, as Trump has. New Jersey senator Cory Booker is testifying against Alabama senator Jeff Sessions in Sessions\u2019 attorney general confirmation hearings. It\u2019s unusual \u2013 precedents don\u2019t readily come to mind \u2013 for a senator to testify against a colleague at such hearings. Booker says Sessions hasn\u2019t shown he\u2019s committed to equal rights: Trump was telling the truth about the $2bn in Dubai deals he turned down at the weekend: President Trump, batting a thousand so far on avoiding corruption (that we know of) (he hasn\u2019t been inaugurated yet). Who\u2019s to say he can\u2019t keep this up. The extraordinary but unverified documents published on Tuesday on Donald Trump\u2019s ties with Moscow began life as a piece of opposition research, which has become as much a part of US politics as yard signs and coloured balloons. There is a small industry of research and investigative firms in Washington, typically staffed by a mix of former journalists and security officials, adept at finding information about politicians that the politicians would rather stay hidden. The firms often do not know who exactly is hiring them; the request could come from a law firm acting on behalf of a client from one of the parties. In this case, the request for opposition research on Donald Trump came from one of his Republican opponents in the primary campaign. The research firm then hired one of its sub-contractors who it used regularly on all things Russian: a retired western European former counter-intelligence official, with a long history of dealing with the shadow world of Moscow\u2019s spooks and siloviki (securocrats). Read further: Democratic representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland releases a statement vowing congressional action to shed light on Trump\u2019s potential conflicts of interest, given Trump\u2019s decision not to divest from the Trump organization. \u201cCongress must [obtain] all corporate and legal documents relating to the president-elect\u2019s global entanglements and business dealings, including the tax returns he promised to produce to the American people,\u201d Cummings says. This was quite an exchange between Trump and CNN\u2019s persistent Jim Acosta, whom Trump denied a question: What did you think about that Trump news conference? Russia Trump finally conceded that Russia hacked the DNC and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, but, Trump said, a lot of other people try to hack the US too. Trump said Putin would stop such behavior when he, Trump, is president. Trump ignored a question about whether anyone in his campaign had had contacts with Moscow during the campaign. And he dismissed reports that Russia wanted him to win, saying he\u2019ll be tougher on Russia than Clinton would have been. Business Trump claimed to have severed himself from his business interests, but this section of the news conference was a particularly troubling mess. Trump said that as president, he is not subject to a ban on conflicts-of-interest \u2013 at any level, he appeared to assert. He served up a lawyer who made the same assertion. Then the lawyer described a \u201cwall\u201d to be erected between President Trump and the Trump Organization, which is to be managed going forward by Trump\u2019s sons. The lawyer said the Trump Organization would turn over hotel receipts from foreign governments to the US treasury. Trump said a big stack of manila folders next to his lectern contained documents in which he signed control of his organization over to his sons. But who knows what was in those folders; there was no mechanism described for transparency as the supposed restructure takes place, and it\u2019s unclear what window the public can hope to have on President Trump scrupulously not advising his sons about the Trump Organization. Intelligence Finally, Trump suggested that the intelligence community had fabricated documents describing Russia obtaining compromising information about him. He said \u201csick people,\u201d his \u201copponents\u201d, had assembled the documents, and \u201cgarbage\u201d \u201cfake news\u201d media outlets had disseminated them. He rejected outright claims in the documents of contacts between his campaign and Russia, and of him behaving badly in Moscow. He said he always warned people traveling with him about cameras in foreign hotels and that in any case he is a germaphobe. That question for Trump about media reform came from a Breitbart reporter, it turns out. Trump is asked, can you say your campaign did not have contact with Russia? And what\u2019s your message for Putin? Trump: \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be doing it, he won\u2019t be doing it. Russia will have much greater respect for our country when I\u2019m leading it than when other people have led it... we have to work something out... it\u2019s not just Russia... 22m accounts were hacked in this country by China. And that\u2019s because we have no defense.\u201d Trump is on to China \u201ctaking total advantage of us economically.\u201d \u201cAll countries will respect us far more, far more than they do under past administrations.\u201d Trump concludes. \u201cThese papers are all just a piece of the many many companies\u201d I\u2019m turning over to my sons, Trump says. \u201cAnd I hope at the end of eight years that I come back, otherwise if they did a bad job I\u2019ll come back and say \u2018you\u2019re fired\u2019.\u201d \u201cWithin 90 days we will be coming up with a major report on hacking defense, how do we stop this new phenomenon,\u201d Trump says. Trump is asked why he spent weeks undermining the intelligence community\u2019s conclusion about Russian hacking, which he now appears to admit. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty sad when intelligence reports get leaked out to the press,\u201d Trump says. He says it\u2019s illegal. He dodges the question. Trump is asked about the risk of weakening national security by his constantly criticizing the intelligence community. \u201cIntelligence agencies are vital and very very important... We\u2019re going to be putting in some outstanding people,\u201d Trump says. He says he\u2019ll get \u201ca major report on hacking\u201d within 90 days of taking office. Trump says Lindsey Graham \u201cis a nice guy\u201d and he\u2019s not worried about Graham\u2019s criticism. \u201cBBC News, that\u2019s another beauty,\u201d Trump says. The question is, if any of this Buzzfeed business stands up, will you reconsider... \u201cThere\u2019s nothing they can come back with,\u201d Trump says, simply. Trump is asked what media reforms he recommends. That\u2019s a question? \u201cI don\u2019t recommend reforms. I recommend people who have a moral compass,\u201d Trump says. Trump attacks certain members of the media as \u201cvery very dishonest people.\u201d Finally, on the Nazi tweet: \u201cI think it was disgraceful that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out to be so false and fake\u201d to get out, Trump says. Just like Nazi Germany, he says. \u201cAs far as Buzzfeed, which is a failing pile of garbage writing it, I think they\u2019re going to suffer the consequences, and they already are.\u201d Trump says he will not give CNN a question. \u201cYou are fake news.\u201d Trump is asked about his \u201cNazi Germany\u201d tweet and about the border wall with Mexico and about his supreme court nominee timeline. \u201cWe\u2019re going to build a wall,\u201d Trump says. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna wait. Mike Pence is leading an effort to get final approval... Mexico in some form will reimburse us... that will happen. Whether that\u2019s a tax, or it\u2019s a payment... it will happen.\u201d Trump says there\u2019s no difference between Mexico reimbursing the US for costs to build the wall and paying upfront. He\u2019s eager to begin construction. The payment will take care of itself, he says. He says he loves Mexico. \u201cI don\u2019t blame them for what happened. I don\u2019t blame them for taking advantage of the United States. What I say is, we shouldn\u2019t have allowed that to happen.\u201d On the supreme court, Trump has a list of 20, he\u2019s met the candidates, Jim Demint was involved (Heritage foundation), \u201cWe have a great group of people.\u201d \u201cI will be making a decision... probably within two weeks of the 20th.\u201d On day one in office, \u201cWe\u2019ll also be doing some very good signings.\u201d Trump says \u201cthe word is now out\u201d that when you want to move your plant overseas and fire American workers, \u201cnot gonna happen that way anymore\u201d. Trump says US companies that want to sell \u201cthrough what will be a very very strong border \u2013 not gonna happen. You\u2019re going to pay a very large border tax\u201d. You can move from Michigan to Tennessee, from South Carolina back to Michigan \u2013 you got a lot of states at play, a lot of competition ... and I don\u2019t care as long as it\u2019s in the United States ... There will be a major border tax on these companies that are leaving and getting away with murder. Trump says his nominees \u201care doing very, very well.\u201d Now on Obamacare. What\u2019s Trump saying about the timeline? What\u2019s his plan? \u201cFinally,\u201d Trump says. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be very very proud of what we put forth... Obamacare is a complete and total disaster... it\u2019s imploding.\u201d Trump lapses into a well-worn criticism of the Obama health care law. \u201cWe could sit back and wait and watch and criticize, we could be a Chuck Schumer... and they would come begging to us, please we have to do something about Obamacare. We don\u2019t want to own it. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be submitting as soon as our secretary is approved... a plan. It\u2019ll be repeal and replace. It\u2019ll be essentially simultaneously... probably the same day... complicated stuff... \u201cWe\u2019re gonna get healthcare taken care of in this country.\u201d Trump says Tillerson is \u201cbrilliant.\u201d He says Sessions \u201cwas brilliant.\u201d Trump says Sessions was \u201ca great prosecutor and attorney general in Alabama.\u201d \u201cI think we have one of the great cabinets ever put together, and we\u2019ve heard that from so many people,\u201d Trump says. Dillon says Trump won\u2019t take gifts \u2013 emoluments, as the Constitution has it \u2013 from foreign governments. Dillon says the clause does not apply to \u201cfair-value exchanges that have absolutely nothing to do with an office-holder.\u201d She says emoluments don\u2019t cover routine business transactions, like \u201cpaying for hotel rooms.\u201d \u201cPaying for a hotel room is not a gift or a present, and it has nothing with office. It\u2019s not an emolument.\u201d This all refers to the Trump hotel in the old post office building in DC, where foreign governments have scheduled big events, perhaps to curry favor with the incoming president. \u201cHe is going to voluntary donate all profits from foreign governments made to his hotels to the United States treasury,\u201d Dillon says. Another charity promise from Trump. Trump has a long history of promising to or appearing to make donations to charity but failing to follow through. \u201cIn sum, all of these actions \u2013 complete relinquishment of management, no foreign deals, ethics adviser approval of deals, and sharply delineated information rights\u201d will resolve any conflict of interest, Dillon says. Why not divest? \u201cSelling would not eliminate conflict of interests,\u201d Dillon says. Also selling the assets would \u201ccreate a fire sale\u201d and \u201cselling the entire Trump organization isn\u2019t even feasible\u201d and Trump shouldn\u2019t be required to liquidate his life\u2019s work. Also an IPO is not an option \u2013 too \u201ccumbersome,\u201d Dillon says. Neither is a blind trust. \u201cYou cannot have a totally blind trust with operating businesses,\u201d she says, which is credible. The question is, can you build a credible firewall of information between Donald Trump and Donald Trump Jr / Eric Trump? Dillon, the lawyer, says a trust will be created by 20 January. The trust will hold cash and perhaps an index investment and \u201cpreexisting and illiquid business assets \u2013 golf clubs, resorts, hotels, royalties, real estate\u201d. And the management of the Trump organization goes to Don Jr and Eric, and a third Trump executive. The management team will include an ethics adviser, Dillon says. \u201cPresident-elect Trump will resign from all offices he holds\u201d with the Trump organization, she says. Trump has \u201calready disposed\u201d with all publicly traded and \u201ceasily liquidated\u201d investments she says. \u201cNo new foreign deals will be made whatsoever during the duration of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency,\u201d she says. Trump won\u2019t talk to his sons about new domestic deals, Dillon says. Trump \u201cwill only know of a deal if he reads it in the paper or sees it on TV\u201d. Dillon calls the division between Trump and the Trump organization a \u201cwall\u201d. \u201cThese papers are just some of the documents that I\u2019ve signed turning over complete and total control to my sons,\u201d Trump says, referring to his business interests. Trump calls up a lawyer, Sheri Dillon, who describes his \u201cmassive\u201d business \u201cempire\u201d which she compares to Nelson Rockefeller. The lawyer continues: \u201cHe directed me and my colleagues... to design a structure that would ... completely isolate him from his management of the company.\u201d \u201cThe conflicts of interest laws simply do not apply to the president and the vice president,\u201d she says. \u201cEven so, president-elect Trump wants there to be no doubt in the minds of the American public that he is completely isolating himself from his business interests.\u201d Trump says \u201cI have no dealings\u201d in Russia, \u201cno loans, no current pending deals.\u201d \u201cOver the weekend, I was offered $2bn to do a deal in Dubai\u201d with \u201ca friend of mine\u201d. \u201cGreat guy.\u201d I turned it down. I didn\u2019t have to turn it down, because as you know, I have a no-conflict situation because I\u2019m president ... Pence also has it. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll need it ... I have a no conflict of interest provision as president ... I could actually run my business and run government at the same time. I don\u2019t like the way that looks but I would be able to do that if I wanted to. On his tax returns: I\u2019m not releasing the tax returns because they\u2019re under audit ... The only people that care about my tax returns is the reporters ... I won. I became president. I think you care. First of all you learn very little from tax returns. Trump says he has always been aware of spying in hotel rooms in countries including Russia. And he warns people he travels with specifically about small cameras. I am extremely careful. I\u2019m surrounded by bodyguards ... I always tell them, be very careful, because ... in those rooms you have cameras in the strangest places ... You can\u2019t see them and you won\u2019t know. You better be careful or you will be watching yourself on nightly television. \u201cI\u2019m also very much of a germaphobe, by the way,\u201d Trump says, drawing laughter from the room. Trump is asked if he accepts that Putin tried to elect him. If Putin likes Donald Trump, I consider that an asset, not a liability, because we have a horrible relationship with Russia ... If Putin likes Donald Trump, guess what folks, that\u2019s called an asset, not a liability. He adds: \u201cDo you honestly believe that Hillary would be tougher on Putin than me? Does anybody really believe that?\u201d Trump: President Putin and Russia put out a statement today that this fake news was fake news ... I respected the fact that he said that. \u201cIf they had something, they would have released it,\u201d Trump says. That is ... unless they were trying to elect Trump? Trump says hacking is bad, \u201cbut look at the things that were learned ... that Hillary Clinton got the questions to the debate but didn\u2019t report it? Can you imagine if Donald Trump got the questions to the debate? It\u2019s a very terrible thing.\u201d Trump says the DNC was vulnerable to hacking and the RNC was not thanks to chairman Reince Priebus, his incoming chief of staff. Question time. Did Trump get the two-page summary about Russia during his intelligence briefing, and does he accept intelligence assessments that Putin hacked the DNC? Trump: The meetings are classified. We had many witnesses in the meeting. On the documents published by Buzzfeed, he says: I think it\u2019s a disgrace that information would be let out ... it\u2019s all fake news. It\u2019s phony stuff, it didn\u2019t happen. It was gotten by opponents of ours ... It was a group of opponents that got together, sick people, and they got that crap together. He adds: \u201cAs far as hacking, I think it was Russia, but I think we also get hacked by other countries, other people.\u201d \u201cBy the way, speaking of veterans,\u201d Trump has tapped David Shulkin to lead the veteran\u2019s administration, he says. Shulkin is under-secretary for health for the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. Trump moves on. He says that car companies are reversing plans to set up plants overseas. He says he hopes the pharmaceutical industry, which is \u201cgetting away with murder,\u201d will be next. \u201cPharma\u201d has a lot of lobbyists, \u201ca lot of power,\u201d Trump says. Then he\u2019s on to the F-35, the overbudget delayed fighter jet projects. Trump says he\u2019s gotten to know \u201cthe generals\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019re gonna do big things.\u201d We\u2019re going to have some competition and it\u2019s going to be a beautiful thing. Trump moves on. He says he met with Jack Ma and Bernard Arnault, and if the election did not turn out the way it did, those foreign executives would not be talking with American leaders. \u201cI will be the greatest jobs producer that god ever created,\u201d Trump says. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need certain amounts of other things, including a little bit of luck.\u201d He moves on. Military bands are going to play the inauguration, he says. Here\u2019s Trump. He says thanks. He says he used to do news conference almost daily. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be with you,\u201d he says. \u201cWe stopped giving them because we were getting a lot of inaccurate news.\u201d He thanks news organizations who did not publish \u201cthat nonsense\u201d released by \u201cmaybe the intelligence agencies, who knows, maybe the intelligence agencies.\u201d He says if the intelligence community did release the documents, which he calls \u201cfake news,\u201d it would be a \u201ctremendous blot\u201d on their legacy. That was a guns-blazing condemnation by Spicer of the decision to publish documents claiming to detail outr\u00e9 Trump conduct in Russia, documents that senator John McCain saw fit to pass to the FBI. Spicer dismissed the reports contained in the documents as wholly false and riddled with inaccuracies. Mike Pence, the incoming vice president, says the media has attempted \u201cto delegtimize this election\u201d. He calls the publication of the documents the result of \u201cmedia bias and an attempt to demean the president-elect\u201d. Spicer introduces vice-president-elect Mike Pence. \u201cWe are nine days away from the inauguration of the 45th president of the United States of America,\u201d he says. He says he\u2019s profoundly honored and humbled. Sean Spicer, Trump\u2019s incoming press secretary, speaks as Trump arrives with his children Ivanka, Donald Jr and Eric. Spicer refers to the \u201cfrankly outrageous and highly irresponsible for a left-wing blog [Buzzfeed] ... to drop highly salacious ... information on the internet just days before he takes office.\u201d He calls Buzzfeed\u2019s decision to publish the Russia report \u201ca sad and pathetic attempt to get clicks\u201d. Trump strategist Stephen Bannon is sighted in the Trump Tower lobby in advance of the presser. The TV correspondents are at the front of the room performing their stand-ups to camera. Feels not long now. This seems like a good guess. What do you think is in those folders? His tax returns? Trump news conference: Now with props. What is it with Trump and props? The Guardian\u2019s Ed Pilkington is at Trump Tower for the big news conference. We have a video stream now atop the blog. Here\u2019s another: President-elect Trump is about to face the media for the first time since July, and the journalists crammed into the lobby of Trump Tower in Fifth Avenue, Manhattan are bracing themselves for what promises to be a feisty encounter. Trump likes to denigrate those covering him as the \u201ccrooked media\u201d, and that was even before the incendiary events overnight. CNN put a fuse under the press conference on Tuesday night by reporting that intelligence chiefs had informed him as well as President Obama of unsubstantiated allegations that Russian operatives claimed to have compromising information on the next US head of state. Then BuzzFeed lit the fuse by publishing the \u201cunverified\u201d memo on which the claims were based. The press encounter is being held in the lobby of Trump Tower, just in front of the gold escalator down which Trump and his family came in 2015 at the launch of his unlikely bid for the White House. Now the space has been patched up into a visual feast fit for an incoming president, with a blue cloth backdrop and a row of 10 American flags in front of which the president-elect will stand at a podium. Lest anyone is in any doubt about who is in charge here, in terms of the relationship between the real estate billionaire-turned-politician and the media, the room is painfully overcrowded. There are about 60 more journalists in the room than seats to accommodate them, producing a distinctly edgy feeling even before the great man arrives. Protesters warning that \u201coil is dead\u201d interrupt the Tillerson hearing. \u201cSenators, be brave. Reject this man! Protect the vulnerable,\u201d a protester says. We break away momentarily from the Tillerson hearing to remind everyone that Trump is due to meet the press \u2013 for his first news conference in some six months \u2013 in about 20 minutes. He has (had) a way of starting these things late. Tillerson is asked whether Trump agrees with him about Putin and Russia. \u201cThe president-elect and I have not had the opportunity to discuss this specific issue, or the specific area.\u201d Really? asks senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey. The men have spoken \u201cin a broad construct and in terms of the principals that are going to guide that,\u201d Tillerson says. But not specifically about Russia? \u201cThat has not occurred yet, senator.\u201d Menendez: \u201cPretty amazing.\u201d Rubio asks: Is Vladimir Putin a war criminal? \u201cI would not use that term,\u201d Tillerson says. Rubio says, let me read you a description of Russian atrocities in Syria. He does and then moves on to the bombing of Chechens in Grozny. Tillerson is staring at Rubio and blinking. Rubio is hammering him a bit, with descriptions of Putin\u2019s war crimes, which is an interesting fix for the secretary of state nominee to find himself in, pressed in the direction of defending Putin. Rubio: \u201cBut he\u2019s not a war criminal?\u201d Tillerson: \u201cThose are very very serious charges to make, and I would want to have much more information before reaching a conclusion.\u201d Tillerson says he\u2019d want \u201cto be fully informed about what\u2019s happening.\u201d Rubio: \u201cIt should not be hard to say that Vladimir Putin\u2019s military has committed war crimes in Aleppo. I find it discouraging your inability to cite that.\u201d Rubio asks Tillerson whether he accepts that Putin has had dissidents shot, poisoned and killed. Tillerson said \u201cit\u2019s important in dealing with information\u201d and \u201cI am not willing to make conclusions with what is publicly available.\u201d Rubio: \u201cNone of this is classified Mr Tillerson. These people are dead.\u201d Rubio asks Tillerson whether he believes that reports of Russian tampering of the US election were accurate. Tillerson finds the intelligence reports persuasive in a way that the president-elect markedly does not. Tillerson: I\u2019ve had not classified briefings... I did read the interagency report.. that report clearly is troubling... and indicates all the actions you described were undertaken.\u201d Tillerson says he can\u2019t determine whether Putin personally directed the hacking. Pressed, Tillerson says it\u2019s \u201ca fair assumption\u201d that Putin directed the hacking. Tillerson says \u201cthreats of climate change\u201d \u201crequire a global response.\u201d Tillerson invokes Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cbig stick.\u201d \u201cWhether you use it or not is the question,\u201d he says. Tough question: what would you have done about Crimea and Ukraine? Tillerson said he would have provided air surveillance of the Ukrainian-Crimea border and done more to support Ukrainian forces. Then he describes a military showdown. \u201cI think what Russian leadership would have understood is a powerful response that \u2018yes, you took Crimea, but that stops right here.\u2019\u201d \u201cThat is the type of response that Russia expects. .. The taking of Crimea was an act of force. And so it required a proportional act, a proportional show of force.\u201d Do we get a follow-up question about the risks of a military showdown over Crimea? No, we do not. Cardin asks Tillerson if Russia has a legitimate claim to Crimea. \u201cNo sir. That was a taking of territory that was not theirs.\u201d Tillerson concludes. Corker asks him if he\u2019ll commit to testify before the committe. Tillerson says yes. Corker dishes the mic to Cardin immediately, saying he\u2019ll reserve his time for interjections. After Cardin is Florida senator Marco Rubio. During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump told ABC News that Russian president Vladimir Putin was \u201cnot going to go into\u201d Ukraine. His secretary of state nominee has just said that Russia \u201cinvaded\u201d Ukraine. Tillerson also makes a statement that sounds like support for US commitments to the Nato alliance in eastern Europe: \u201cRussia must know that we will be accountable to our commitments and those of our allies, and Russia will be held to account for its actions.\u201d He says that Russia \u201chas invaded Ukraine\u201d and that allies \u201care right to raise the alarm\u201d about Russia. \u201cRussia today poses a danger, but it is not unpredictable in advancing its own interests,\u201d he said. The Trump transition Twitter account is tweeting standout lines from Tillerson\u2019s opening statement: Tillerson had just finished describing the Isis threat. \u201cWhen everything is a priority, nothing is a priority,\u201d Tillerson says. \u201cEliminating Isis must be our foremost priority in the Middle East.\u201d Tillerson says he \u201cmake sure the state department does its part in recognizing\u201d Muslims who aid the USA in its combat against designated enemies in the Middle East. Tillerson says China has helped fight jihadist terrorism. Tillerson comes out as an American exceptionalist: \u201cWe are the only superpower with the means and the moral compass capable of shaping the world for good.\u201d But in recent years the US has \u201cstumbled\u201d with \u201cactions and non-actions\u201d that have created a \u201cvoid of uncertainty,\u201d Tillerson says. Tillerson says he wants to explain Trump\u2019s vision for a bold new foreign policy. Tillerson digs into a rather generalist opening statement. \u201cAmerican leadership must not only be renewed, it must be asserted.\u201d He\u2019s interrupted by a protester. \u201cRex Tillerson, I reject you. My home was destroyed by Hurricane Sandy.\u201d That sounds like a warning about climate change, about which Tillerson is skeptical. After about an hour of senators talking, Tillerson is about to say something. Tillerson introduces his wife of \u201cmore than thirty years,\u201d Renda St Clair; his sisters and brother-in-law. Here\u2019s a live stream of the second day of the Jeff Sessions hearings, getting under way now: Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee, which will question Rex Tillerson this morning, has just concluded his opening statement. Corker, a Republican, expressed confidence that Tillerson would be a good secretary of state. \u201cMy sense is\u201d that you\u2019ll rise to the occasion, Corker told Tillerson. The committee\u2019s ranking member, Maryland senator Ben Cardin, is delivering an opening statement now. As we continue our coverage of Trump\u2019s denial of the accuracy of pages of \u201csensitive information\u201d circulated about him and his alleged secret salacious ties to Russia, we\u2019re going to check in on the confirmation hearings of secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson, which have just started. A live stream is here: We\u2019ll also have an eye on Day 2 of the Jeff Sessions attorney general confirmation hearings and the Elaine Chao transportation secretary hearings. For quick context, read our coverage of Day 1 of the Sessions hearings and our guide to what to expect from the other two: Senator John McCain has released a statement confirming that he received \u201csensitive information\u201d that he passed to the FBI, as previously reported. McCain says he was \u201cunable to make a judgment about [the contents\u2019] accuracy\u201d. Here is the statement in full: Late last year, I received sensitive information that has since been made public. Upon examination of the contents, and unable to make a judgment about their accuracy, I delivered the information to the Director of the FBI. That has been the extent of my contact with the FBI or any other government agency regarding this issue.\u201d That Trump press conference should get underway in a couple of hours. Security is predictably tight. The BBC has also compiled a list of 10 questions for Trump, including these three: Were any of your team in contact with Russian officials during the campaign? Do you have confidence in the US intelligence services, and do you think they have confidence in you? You mocked Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton over their attempts at a \u201creset\u201d of relations with Russia. How does your approach to improving ties with Russia differ from theirs? NBC News lists 10 questions Trump needs to answer during his press conference. The first three are on Russia: 1. After the intelligence briefing you received on Friday, you and your team released statements, fired off tweets, and conducted interviews -- but never once condemned Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election. Why give Russia and Vladimir Putin a pass? And why more outrage directed at the victim (the DNC, John Podesta) than the perpetrator (Russia). 2. In the year and a half that you\u2019ve either been running for office or been president-elect, you\u2019ve criticized numerous Republicans, Democrats, and members of the media. But you\u2019ve never once criticized Putin. Why not? 3. You\u2019ve said that Russia\u2019s interference didn\u2019t impact the result of the election. But you eagerly cited WikiLeaks revelations against Hillary Clinton and her team in the final weeks of the campaign, saying things like, \u201cBoy, I love reading those WikiLeaks\u201d and \u201cThis WikiLeaks is like a treasure trove.\u201d If they didn\u2019t impact the election, why were you citing them on the campaign trail? Trump\u2019s press conference is at least two and half hours away (it\u2019s due to start at 11am or 4pm GMT) but journalists and film crews are already gathering at Trump Tower. Reuters rounds up Trump\u2019s denials on Twitter, caps lock and all: US President-elect Donald Trump said that Russia had never tried to use leverage with him and blamed intelligence agencies for news reports that Moscow had compiled compromising information on him. In a series of Twitter posts hours before his first news conference in nearly six months, Trump accused intelligence agencies of taking \u201cone last shot\u201d at him by leaking the information. \u201cAre we living in Nazi Germany?\u201d he asked. The businessman-turned-politician, due to enter the White House in nine days, and his appointed chief of staff, Reince Priebus, derided as \u201cfake news\u201d a CNN report that classified documents presented to Trump in an intelligence briefing last week included allegations that Russian operatives claim to have compromising information about him. \u201cRussia has never tried to use leverage over me. I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA - NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING!\u201d Trump wrote in one of the Twitter posts. He pointed to the Kremlin\u2019s denials of the reports on the dossier that emerged late on Tuesday, writing, \u201cRussia just said the unverified report paid for by political opponents is \u2018A COMPLETE AND TOTAL FABRICATION, UTTER NONSENSE.\u2019 Very unfair!\u201d Trump has now accused the intelligence agencies of allowing fake news to leak into the public domain. And it didn\u2019t take long for Godwin\u2019s law to kick in. Yet more fury from Trump. but still no specific denials, as analysts have noted. More Trump Twitter denials: President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway has described the called the allegations as \u201cfake news\u201d, McClatchy reports. Conway told Seth Meyers on \u201cLate Night\u201d that Trump \u201csaid he\u2019s not aware\u201d of being briefed on reports that Russia had compromising information on him, despite a CNN report earlier that day saying he and President Barack Obama had both been presented with the information. \u201cWe should be concerned that intelligence officials leak to the press and won\u2019t go and tell the president-elect or the president of the United States himself now, Mr. Obama, what the information is,\u201d Conway said Tuesday. \u201cThey\u2019d rather go tell the press.\u201d Donald Trump has issued a fresh denial His chief of staff Reince Priebus also dismissed the claims. \u201cFirst I heard of any of these wild accusations was when someone printed it off BuzzFeed,\u201d he told the Today show. ProPublica\u2019s president Richard Tofel has defended BuzzFeed\u2019s decision to publish the unverified dossier. He said publication will help to establish the truth of the claims in the documents. The whistleblowing website WikiLeaks has dismissed the dossier as \u201cclearly bogus\u201d. Last month it was reported that CIA analysis found that people with connections to the Russian government provided emails, hacked from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, to WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has denied links with Russia\u2019s government. The Kremlin has ridiculed the claims it collected compromising material on Trump as unfounded and laughable, writes Alec Luhn in Moscow. Russian state media dismissed the reports as still more unproven accusations against the country, which a report published last week by US intelligence agencies said had meddled in the 2016 presidential election to help Trump. \u201cIts content was like a parody of poorly constructed kompromat,\u201d the television channel Rossiya 24 said of the reports, using a common term for compromising material. There is a long tradition in Russia of kompromat surfacing and leading to the disgrace of political figures and opposition activists. Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, called the dossier \u201cpulp fiction\u201d, saying the Kremlin did not have compromising material on Trump nor on Hillary Clinton, as the documents also said. \u201cThis is an absolute canard, an absolute fabrication, and it\u2019s complete nonsense,\u201d Peskov said in a statement. \u201cThe Kremlin does not engage in collecting kompromat.\u201d Peskov said Moscow needed to \u201crespond with the appropriate humor\u201d to the allegations, but also called the news an \u201cobvious attempt to harm our bilateral relations\u201d with the United States. \u201cThere are those who bend over backwards to ratchet up tensions and continue the witch-hunt. This is necessary so relations remain in a state of degradation.\u201d Donald Trump is due to hold his first news conference in nearly six months later on Wednesday. The press conference was planned before the dossier on Trump\u2019s alleged links with Russia was published, but it is sure to be top of the agenda, according to a curtain-raiser by the New York Times. Atop the list of likely subjects: news that Mr. Trump was briefed last week on unsubstantiated reports that Russia had collected compromising, salacious personal information about him. Before those reports, the timing of Mr. Trump\u2019s planned appearance had seemed deliberate. But by speaking the day after Mr. Obama\u2019s address, he is inviting a conspicuous contrast, betting that his freewheeling style will compare favorably with the president\u2019s preference for restraint. It also remains to be seen whether Mr. Trump, now just over a week away from his inauguration, will make any attempt to adjust his frequently confrontational tone with opponents and the news media. Recent history, on his Twitter account and beyond, suggests otherwise. No other US president-elect in modern times has waited so long to go formally before the media, according to AFP. He is expected to go before the cameras at 11:00 am (1600 GMT) at Trump Tower. Washington\u2019s uneasy relations with Russia will be scrutinised further at the Senate confirmation hearing - also due to take place Wednesday - of former ExxonMobil boss Rex Tillerson \u2013 Trump\u2019s nomination for secretary of state. Tillerson is under fire for his close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. In prepared remarks distributed by the Trump transition team ahead of the hearing, Tillerson called for a \u201ccleareyed\u201d assessment of the United States\u2019 relationship with Russia. \u201cRussia today poses a danger, but it is not unpredictable in advancing its own interests,\u201d he will say. Welcome to live coverage on the aftermath of the publication of explosive, but unverified, allegations that Donald Trump had secret contacts with Moscow and that Russia has enough compromising material to blackmail the president-elect. Last month Senator John McCain passed a six month dossier of memos complied by a former MI6 counterintelligence official, to the FBI director, James Comey. It contains a series of extraordinary, and sometimes salacious, allegations that Trump has dismissed as \u201cfake news\u201d and a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d. The unsubstantiated allegations include: The Kremlin has been assisting Trump for a least five years. Trump was offered, but declined, sweetener property deals in Russia including developments linked to the 2018 World Cup. The Russian security service, the FSB, \u201ccompromised Trump through his activities in Moscow sufficiently to be able to blackmail him\u201d. Trump\u2019s foreign policy adviser Carter Page held a secret meeting in July 2016 with Igor Sechin, the head of Rosneft, Russia\u2019s state owned oil company. Page was warned by another official, Igor Divyekin, that Moscow had compromising material or \u201ckompromat\u201d on Trump. The unverified dossier has been published in full by BuzzFeed in a decision that has triggered a political storm and debate over media ethics, as Rory Carroll reports. The news website posted the unredacted documents on Tuesday, just 10 days before Trump\u2019s inauguration, with a warning that the contents contained errors and were \u201cunverified and potentially unverifiable\u201d . The decision to put the claims in the public domain forced other media outlets to repeat the allegations or ignore a story that lit up the internet. Some critics rounded on BuzzFeed, calling it irresponsible ... Other media outlets including the Guardian obtained and reviewed the documents in recent weeks but declined to publish because there was no way to independently verify them. Here\u2019s how news of the dossier, and reaction to it, emerged. 30 October Former Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid accuses FBI director Comey of sitting on \u201cexplosive\u201d proof of Trump\u2019s links to Russia. 31 October 2016 The existence of the documents were first reported by Mother Jones. It reported that \u201cveteran spy has given the FBI information alleging a Russian Operation to Cultivate Donald Trump.\u201d 9 December 2016 Senator John McCain, whose armed service committee is conducting a separate inquiry into Russian cyber attacks during the election, passed a copy of the full dossier to FBI Director James Comey. 10 January 2017 In a report co-written by the veteran investigative journalist Carl Bernstein, CNN says the FBI is still investigating the credibility of the documents. It said four intelligence chiefs had included a summary of the material in a secret briefing on Russian interference in the election delivered last week to Barack Obama and Trump. 11 January 2017 BuzzFeed publishes an unredacted copy of the dossier, despite \u201cserious reason to doubt the allegations\u201d. Donald Trump\u2019s team has yet to issue a full response. But the president-elect has dismissed the allegations in a caps lock tweet: We will be tracking the rest of the fallout as it emerges."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
