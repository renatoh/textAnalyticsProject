According to the Birmingham Post, staff have been told the group is looking for a buyer for its titles, which include 20 local weeklies and five magazines. The family-run company, the 14th largest regional newspaper publisher in the UK and one of the country's largest freesheet distributors, publishes well over 500,000 local papers a week across Warwickshire, Worcestershire, West Midlands and Gloucestershire. It was founded 20 years ago by Chris Bullivant with the launch of the Leamington Spa Observer. Its other titles include the Redditch Standard and Solihull Observer. Bullivant is chairman, his wife Pat is deputy chairman, and his son Chris is managing director. Two years ago Bullivant announced that he was planning to bid for Trinity Mirror's Midlands titles, including the Birmingham Post and the Birmingham Mail. He later claimed that Trinity Mirror had forced him out of the bidding race. But the titles were taken off sale and remain in TM's hands. In a website message to celebrate his company's 20th anniversary, Bullivant salutes his \"great members of staff\" adding that \"their faith in our products, like my own, has never faltered - a comprehensive trustworthy local news service, a reliable distribution network, excellent service and the ability to deliver what we promise.\" In fact, the Post reports that Observer Standard cut 80% of its workforce, including eight editorial staff, in November last year after a drop in advertising revenue. This turn of events is certain to be adduced by other regional owners as further proof of the current crisis and the need for the government to act swiftly in order to allow for further consolidation in the industry. It is also clear evidence that the day of the free newspaper is over as the recession deepens. The business model for freesheets just doesn't make sense as more and more advertisers withdraw."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
