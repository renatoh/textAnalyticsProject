Don't read on if you haven't seen episodes nine and 10 \u2013 and please do not leave spoilers if you've seen further in the series. James Donaghy's episodes seven and eight blog Hello and welcome to the latest instalment of our Spiral blog, manned so marvellously by James O'Donaghy last week while I was off taking a holiday from BBC4. That I found myself eyeing up leather jackets while en vacances has nothing to do with missing our favourite team of French blunderers, you understand. Nothing at all. Why yes, that is an an orange armband I'm sporting. What? I am, in any case, not the only one trying to impersonate a police officer, what with Rodi Ozbek's assortment of muscle using the fluorescent bracelets to snatch \u00c7etin \u2013 my only suprise is that it doesn't happen all the time. (Maybe it does.) And having snuck back in while my back was turned, Samy was also donning an unlikely costume this week. Honestly, that ridiculous stick-on moustache made him look like Mr Potato Head. Disguise is not always a matter of costume, however. From Tintin's agoraphobia to Laure's chemistry with Samy, to Pierre's inability to control Jorkal despite his bravado, Spiral was awash this week with people trying to hide the truth from each other and themselves. Oddly, Jos\u00e9phine, the great deceiver, was the one to come clean \u2013 both about her feelings for Pierre and the identity of Thomas Riffaut, although the two are of course linked. But what most pleased me this double bill, however, was the realisation that France's best detective is not, in fact, the tax office, but Marianne. If Herville gets that job he's hankering after, maybe Roban's clerk could be drafted in as his replacement. Not only would she be a great deal less repellent, but crime would basically be solved. Which is more than you can say for the current set-up \u2026 Les flics Since when has Gilou been the department's agony aunt? But here he is, counselling Tintin in his own inimitable style \u2013 a massive shove then a guilt trip about how everyone is being put in danger usually does it \u2013 and warning Laure off getting involved with Samy. He'll have his own advice column soon. Week one: how to break into a barge, presumably. That said, officer Escoffier is worryingly the voice of reason here: Tintin should never have come back to work so early, not least because his scar seems to get more livid with every scene, and Laure should be wary of throwing away her relationship for a man who disappeared without a whisper. Albeit a hot man who has made his intentions only too clear. Away from Gilou's special brand of pastoral care, we're beginning to see lots of threads gathered together, with the Ozbeks and the leftist toerags potentially joined into one operation by Riffaut's desire to blow Paris to smithereens. It's surely only a matter of time before someone joins the dots, most likely by following the DNA trail. (A tactic Roban has perfected, of course.) Before we can get on with solving the Hugo bomb death, however \u2013 the case I almost forgot had started it all until Laure and Jos\u00e9phine reminded us \u2013 we must mention le blunder super, courtesy of cops from another district so interested in an old stolen Citroen ZX worth about two Euros that they staked it out. Really? I was worried the storming of the squat was going to go equally badly, what with all Thomas's grand talk, particularly when Tintin took off round the back of the building. Was Gilou right to stop him shooting? I'm still not entirely sure. Maybe it's the start of a new caring, sharing Escoffier. I won't hold my breath. Les r\u00e9volutionnaires Thomas is basically all mouth and no trousers, apart from when it comes to endangering other people, of course. Which is why he's off to buy a load of explosives and presumably hand them straight over to someone else. Question is: where is the target? Monsieur le Juge Poor Roban. Stymied by higher-ups who care more about keeping the peace and supporting their peers than justice, he finds himself stripped of office \u2013 although not before sneakily getting Laure her warrant. This was an amazing performance from Philippe Duclos, with the courtroom scene quite thrilling: from Marianne's impromptu, heartfelt praise of Fran\u00e7ois, to the arrival of the DNA evidence, to Roban's increasingly passionate defence of justice. I loved the shot of him walking from court, stooped under the weight of it all, echoing the shot of Jos\u00e9phine, alone and crumpled in the hall. But now? Marianne might have come up trumps once more \u2013 really, she is a marvel \u2013 with what seems to be evidence of Garnier taking kickbacks from a firm of lawyers in return for aquittals or light sentences. Machard was correct to remind Roban of the scale of the story. It would be an absolute outrage: but can Roban, with no office or powers, really prove it is true? A thought about all this Roban stuff: even if the court doesn't think the DNA evidence and Garnier's refusal to compare the rapes was interesting, I'm sure lots of journalists would. And what does the judge have to lose now he is bound for the divorce disputes of Quimper? (Which actually looks quite nice.) Les avocats And talking of dodgy lawyers \u2026 Thank goodness for the double bill. I'm not sure I could have lasted a whole week pondering the fate of the most brilliantly sulky lawyer in history. (Her face at the handcuffs was brilliant.) I'd say \"poor Jos\u00e9phine\", but in some ways the situation is largely of her own making, and I'm still not convinced that the actions that got her there have entirely made sense within the drama. Not liking policemen is one thing; protecting an anarchist cell from Special Branch is quite another. Where you couldn't help but feel sympathy for Jos\u00e9phine, however, was when it came it to Pierre's rejection; his calling time on their relationship, if that isn't far too grand a word for it, despite her pleas. It was clever the way we were led to believe that he would/had saved her, when in fact he seemed to have come to her bedside to ask one thing: \"Was it because of me?\". Well, what do you think, Ma\u00eetre? If there's anyone Mr Cl\u00e9ment is going to need in his current hour of need, however, it is Jos\u00e9phine. After years of working for Szabo and his ilk, she warned him of the dangers of taking Jorkal as his client. Pierre, however, was too busy being Charlie Big Bananas to take her warnings seriously \u2013 despite being the least likely underworld brief in Paris. A long walk home should give him enough time to figure out a way of escaping Jorkal's clutches. Or a way of persuading Jos\u00e9phine to help him to do so, at any rate. Thoughts and observations \u2022 Inspector Merlot should obviously get his own spin-off show. The scene between him and Christophe Vasseur was fantastic. \u2022 One of the reasons I love Marianne being catapulted into a central storyline is because I find her French much easier to understand than that of other characters. Anyone else? I wonder if it's a fraction slower. (Certainly it's a massive amount less shouty.) \u2022 Can we talk about cars, and being spotted in them? So Vincent, from a window, in the dark, can spot Samy, but there's lots of just sitting about in cars in broad daylight staking people out. Even I'd find a car full of adults with radios a bit suspicious \u2026 \u2022 \"If they kill him, we're fucked.\" Gilou puts on his compassionate face for \u00c7etin's wife. \u2022 I love the Ozbeks and their never-ending family feuds. Also the fact that the oldest brother has the same kind of style as Stefan, the mysterious social worker from The Bridge. \u2022 \"It's hopeless, we should go,\" says Samy after a quick Wire-like walk around the estates. You can find a little additional reading on the banlieues and the relationship between youths and police here and here. \u2022 Two good bits of smoking this week: the Ozbeks, who appear to be keeping the tobacco industry going, all smoke absolutely furiously. While over at the \u00c7etin crime scene, a policeman was having a casual fag all over the evidence. How very French. \u2022 According to this article, 5kg of C-4 would do an awful lot of damage. \u2022 I know it's entirely wrong that I was thinking this during such a tragic scene, but still: Jos\u00e9phine's bathroom was amazing. Even her hospital room was all crisp whites and orchids. I was also, of course, coveting her loungewear in last week's double bill. \u2022 A bit of a fumble, then home to Vincent. Classy, Laure, very classy. (Although actually, the shooting of it was.) And lying about who brought you home before going for a shower? Just as well Vincent's not a detective or anything \u2026"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
