Anyone who has ever had one and been up half the night with it \u2013 or all the night with it, night after night \u2013 can tell you this. Sometimes presidents cry because they\u2019re tired, sometimes they cry because they need their nappy changed, sometimes they cry because they don\u2019t want you to leave them, sometimes they cry because they have a gnawing pain in their tummy, and sometimes they cry because they\u2019re just being impossible that day and you should probably go to bed and leave them to it but somehow you just can\u2019t. To anyone going through it currently: this phase will pass. Of course, a crying president demands incredible amounts of attention, and while you\u2019re in the thick of it, consumed by this, it may feel like it will never stop, or at least you won\u2019t make it out. There are many moments in the small hours where you stare at this crying thing and think wryly: wow, what happened to my life? I think I vaguely remember when it wasn\u2019t like this. The television news \u2013 I like to think of it as the president monitor, lighting up each time he needs attention \u2013 has been on what feels like pretty much constantly in our house since 2016, the year that Trump won (and the UK began its own extended period of toddler meltdown). A child\u2019s formative years are so precious, and I\u2019m sure our children will benefit enormously from all the times I\u2019ve said \u201cShhhh, I\u2019m watching the president,\u201d or occasionally even been forced to momentarily stop watching the president to deliver a behavioural verdict. \u201cI know why you\u2019re acting up \u2013 it\u2019s to get my attention away from the president acting up. Well, it won\u2019t work.\u201d Everyone has their parenting gurus \u2013 as a realist, I follow the Philip Larkin model. And it is typical of the parenting in our house that we, hugely belatedly, started thinking not that we should switch the president monitor off \u2013 don\u2019t be ridiculous! \u2013 but more along the lines of: should we \u2026 maybe say something? Anyway, after a while we did. We said stuff to them like \u201cWe should probably mention that this isn\u2019t normal \u2013 at least, it didn\u2019t used to be. I mean, I know it\u2019s pretty much all the news you\u2019ve ever known in your short and possibly already terminally disillusioned lives. But seriously, in the not-all-that-olden times, you could go DAYS without particularly thinking about politics. Longer!\u201d Eventually we wondered if saying \u201cThis isn\u2019t normal\u201d was even accurate. All our children are under 10. Technically, it was kind of normal. Even in this golden age of TV it was the biggest show on air, and frequently inspired us to seek out other family content. Really, it was impossible not to watch the president\u2019s rosebud anus mouth puckering up and screaming at some rally, and not ask one another: \u201cI wonder if the children would enjoy Rosemary\u2019s Baby? Go on one of those parenting websites and see whether it honestly merits its 18 certificate. Come on \u2013 it was made in the late 60s \u2013 these days even the news is scarier! Which reminds me: can you just put on the news? He\u2019s about to have one of his moments in the Rose Garden, and we should watch the full horror show as a family.\u201d As time wore even further on, we would remark mildly to the children: \u201cSorry about [expansively vague gesture] all THIS. As with all the worst stuff in the world, I\u2019m afraid adults did this. Will it get fixed? Hopefully! If adults don\u2019t fix it pretty quick, they\u2019ll fairly soon be moving on to the phase where they bend down and pat your head and say: \u2018Hey guys, we need your generation to grow up and fix all this!\u2019 That is really the worst, and you SHOULD in fact be outraged that people like that somehow have the power to say to you \u2018Go to bed\u2019 or \u2018Right, I\u2019m taking away the iPad.\u2019\u201d But now, this. After four years, we have FINALLY moved on to much, much safer cautionary tale territory \u2013 because now the president is really just crying. For parents of small children, and also for anyone who has ever seen a small child behave badly in the supermarket or the street, the thing we are watching on TV now is extremely, totally, instantly recognisable even to the very young. The big orange guy is angry because it is not his turn any more. He is being a Bad Loser. Look at him! Someone should stop him. Yes, I agree with you he needs a punishment for this behaviour. Yes, no iPad would be a start. I remember the huge excitement of being got out of bed as a child for major news events on the basis that, \u201cThis is history.\u201d Yet watching Trump have his meltdown on Thursday night, I didn\u2019t exactly feel inspired to get the children out of bed for it. They could watch the giant baby in the morning. We are finally, just about, near the point where it isn\u2019t history. It is just histrionics. \u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
