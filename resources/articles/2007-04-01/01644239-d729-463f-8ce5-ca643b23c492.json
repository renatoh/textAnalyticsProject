Where others might relax with a book, Alice will climb a mountain, abseil off a cliff or hurtle down rapids; she's fiercely independent and has a hectic, frenetic life. She has been drawn to water since the year dot; the first time she crawled it was into the sea. Her surname, after all, means dark water. Having arrived in north Wales, I awoke to three inches of snow and assumed, wrongly, that we'd abort the mission. Al just shouted that I'd better wear extra socks. However, when she saw the partly frozen river, even she looked vaguely concerned. I tried to wriggle into a drysuit but, being nearly 80 and having osteoporosis, I just couldn't. Finally, I made do with a waterproof cagoule on top of my normal clothes, and a life jacket. Alice said it was essential I didn't capsize as I might die instantly from the shock of the cold water: a flicker of alarm registered behind her bravado. I wondered whether to scribble a note saying, \"If I drown, it's not your fault\" - but didn't want to be a drama queen. Thank God for the charming young men who came to our aid. Mark was indispensable; clad in a drysuit, he swam in the freezing water, on hand in case of emergency. Then the boys launched me down the bank, and the ice on the river's edge broke as I nose-dived in. I felt a tremendous rush of adrenaline. It was almost as exciting and terrifying as a first night in the theatre. At first I hardly dared move the paddles, I thought I'd have to sit on my fear throughout, but the excitement just grew and grew. I pretended I was playing a part in a film - courageous granny kayaker to the rescue! We edged towards some rapids and it was thrilling to be bowled along. The fact the kayak balances so precariously means you are at one with the force of the water. Luckily, I got it right, didn't capsize and returned with a glow and a new connection with my gutsy daughter. When Alice then came to visit me in Paris I found it very relaxing. Her life is incredibly full, both of us always try to do just that bit too much and for once we had time to be together. She has so many friends from when she was acting here but didn't try to see them all and instead we were able to meander around content with each other's company. Alice Douglas: I am lucky to have such a healthy mother, she has masses of energy and is out gallivanting most nights, never short of an admirer. However, trying to squeeze her into a drysuit was awful, I could feel her flinch as I forced her arthritic hands through the neoprene cuffs and she yelped as I bent her neck to try to get her head in. It's not really her type of sport but she has a very modest manner, which hides star quality, and Mum always comes up with the goods. Within a couple of minutes she'd mastered the basics and was happily paddling alongside me. There may be a slight disparity between dipping a croissant into your cafe creme on the rue St Jacques and freezing your backside off in a kayak on an icy river in North Wales, but my side of the bargain entailed challenges too. Arranging a three-day jaunt is akin to a military operation: there are children to sort, work deadlines to keep, and the B&amp;B to see to. My life is so chaotic I feel like a donkey on speed pounding a treadmill. I fretted over making myself acceptable for the Parisian scene. Grappling with the country life means I am hardly ever out of my jeans and fleece. I have little time to enjoy the gentler and finer things. Perhaps I'm an adrenaline junkie and just have to go, go, go. Perhaps the break in Paris was a mother's ploy to force me to explore my quieter side and have some \"me\" time. If that was the idea, it got off to a bad start. At 10pm, I arrived to find one of my bags had been pinched from the conveyor belt. Hours of form filling ensued. Consequently, I missed the final shuttle and had to cadge a lift from someone who then had a minor crash. I made the last train by the skin of my teeth. I feared my relentlessly chaotic life was intent on pursuing me. Luckily, I was wrong. I enjoyed a long, delicious sleep and spent the following morning in bed, munching pain au chocolat and chatting with Mum. I was beamed into another dimension. I indulged in a bit of titivation, slipped on my Agn\u00e8s b trousers, borrowed some jewellery and I was ready for business. A little bell sent Mum and I scurrying to the window. Alexis, the actor who lives upstairs, was calling \"Ch\u00e9rie\" as he lowered a beautiful bunch of spring flowers, a weekly offering for my mother's kitchen table. After lunch we browsed the boutiques. Then we sat by Notre Dame reading a French play, Le Jardin by Brigitte Buc, that Mum is translating. She reminded me how as a child I would say, let's pop into Notre Dame, Mum, and have a bit of a pray. The loveliness of Paris, the good life, the pampering, all did me a power of good. I left with my spirits refreshed and, most importantly, I'd had the time to talk to Mum and thank her properly for being such a wonderful mother."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
