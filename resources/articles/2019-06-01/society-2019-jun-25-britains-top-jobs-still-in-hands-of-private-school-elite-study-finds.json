A study by the Sutton Trust and the Social Mobility Commission found that a tiny elite of privately educated people, many of whom went to Oxbridge, continue to dominate high-ranking jobs, where 39% had an independent education, compared with 7% of the general population. Critics described the figures as \u201cscandalous\u201d and called for urgent change. Researchers examined the educational backgrounds of more than 5,000 leading figures across nine broad categories including politicians, tech bosses, stars from the worlds of film, pop and sport, journalists, judges and FTSE 350 chief executives. In politics, they found that 39% of the cabinet (at the time the analysis was carried out) went to fee-paying schools compared with 9% of the shadow cabinet \u2013 down from 22% during Ed Miliband\u2019s reign as Labour leader \u2013 while 29% of the 2017 intake of MPs were privately educated. Elsewhere, 65% of senior judges, 57% of members of the House of Lords, 59% of civil service permanent secretaries and 52% of Foreign Office diplomats come from a private school background. In the media, 43% of the 100 most influential news editors and broadcasters, and 44% of newspaper columnists went to fee-paying schools; 33% of those went to both private school and either Oxford or Cambridge. In the arts, 44% of top actors and 30% of pop stars went to independent schools. In stark contrast, in the world of football, just 5% of male international stars went to private school, the only area where the privately educated are underrepresented. In the world of rugby, meanwhile, 37% of international players were privately educated, and in cricket 43% of the England team went to independent schools. The study, called Elitist Britain 2019, found similar patterns in women\u2019s sport, but it also found that 80% of female international players in football, cricket and rugby had attended university, far higher than in men\u2019s sport. Women continue to be underrepresented in top jobs, but those who make it to the highest echelons are also considerably more likely to have attended a private school than the population at large, though they are less likely to have gone to Oxbridge than their male counterparts. The report identifies a \u201cpipeline\u201d from fee-paying schools through Oxbridge and into top jobs \u2013 52% of senior judges took this route compared with 17% of all those examined. While it found there had been some increase in the diversity of educational backgrounds of those at the top since an equivalent exercise five years ago, change was happening slowly. Luke Heselwood from the Reform thinktank said: \u201cThese scandalous figures show that the UK is far from being a meritocracy. Fixing this will require serious reform to the education system as, despite improvements, the most advantaged are nearly 10 times more likely to attend elite universities than the most disadvantaged.\u201d Dame Martina Milburn, the chair of the Social Mobility Commission, said: \u201cPoliticians, employers and educators all need to work together to ensure that Britain\u2019s elite becomes more diverse in gender, ethnicity and social background. It is time to close the power gap and ensure that those at the top can relate to and represent ordinary people.\u201d The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said: \u201cThe old boys\u2019 network and the old school tie still hold back talented and hard-working people from less privileged backgrounds. Labour will focus on giving every child the chance to flourish, not just a lucky few, focusing on social justice not just social mobility.\u201d A spokesperson for the Independent Schools Council said: \u201cAssumptions about independent schools are far too often based on misconceptions or stereotypes. Many people do not realise that the majority of ISC schools have fewer than 350 pupils, only half are academically selective, and most work in partnership with state schools.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
