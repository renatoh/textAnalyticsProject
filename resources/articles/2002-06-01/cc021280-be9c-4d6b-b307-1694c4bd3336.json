An old man came in unannounced (security is refreshingly lax) and offered - for the service of the China national team - a 1,000-year-old cure for foot injuries; a prescription retained in his family since the Qing Dynasty for use by kung-fu fighters. I thought of offering him David Beckham's phone number, but he explained that he just wanted to make some contribution to China's great national effort in the forthcoming World Cup. In China, football and patriotism get woven together like the strands of amorous silk worms. When China play Brazil on Saturday 8 June, more than a billion Chinese will watch on television. But it won't be simple football enthusiasm that corrals almost a quarter of the human race in one country in front of the telly. It will be an act of nationalistic commitment; a sign of the times. The Chinese government no longer sells communism. No one is interested in buying (and many are too busy making money). These days, the Party sells only patriotism. Hence the desperate desire to qualify for this, China's first World Cup finals. It has been 44 'years of hurt' since the most populous nation first attempted to join the world's biggest party. There have been some painfully close qualifying campaigns in the meantime, notably for Spain in 1982, Italia 90 and the USA in 1994 when they fell at the final hurdle. But at last (and thanks to a very kind draw in the final qualifying group), China will be there, and will not suffer the humiliation - the enormous loss of face - that failure would have meant this time around. After all, the 2002 World Cup takes place almost on China's doorstep. Although only 15,000 tickets were available, up to 100,000 fans may travel to South Korea, If North Korea were open, allowing a land passage south, perhaps half a million Chinese would attend if permitted. As it is, it is still a very expensive trip for the average Chinese fan. Even the cheapest flights from China to South Korea cost about 2,000 yuan (\u00a3180), and that's nearly three times the average monthly wage. Then there's the price of tickets and hotels, plus travel inside South Korea. Just to see China's first three games, the total round trip will cost the equivalent of a year-and-half's salary. That did not stop 1.2 million applying for those 15,000 tickets. Those who can afford it, mostly businessmen and the children of the 'new rich', will travel in groups - cheaper and considered much safer and easier to control - and probably for only one match. In a clever marketing operation, the South Korean electrical goods giant LG staged a competition offering small groups of Chinese fans the chance to realise their dream of going to the World Cup, for free. The football authorities from 10 Chinese cities were invited to send their most vociferous and inventive group of fans to a competition in Beijing last month. The 10 groups - each with about eight fans - had to perform their antics before a specially selected jury (consisting of CFA officials, LG executives and a couple of aerobic dance teachers). The best three groups were rewarded with all-expenses paid trips to South Korea for the duration of China's stay in the competition, so look out for some spectacular aerobics from the Chinese fans. Enthusiasm for the World Cup in China is considerable, but expectations are realistic. If you ask about the prospects for the untried team, most Chinese will shrug and indicate, almost invariably: 'A goal would be nice; a point would be good and a win against anyone would be wonderful.' Qualification from their group (which includes Turkey, Costa Rica and Brazil) would be greeted by parties in the streets, and more than a billion souls in an ecstasy of nationalistic pride. Of course television is the key to delivering the football to the mass of the population. And Chinese TV is making a lot of money from the World Cup. The state-run sports channel, CCTV 5, was protected from any competition in the 'bidding' for the rights. Consequently, the government broadcasters got the rights for 2002 and 2006 for just $25m; one tenth of the price BBC and ITV paid. CCTV's head of advertising, Guo Zhenxi, said they expect to take more than $48m in advertising revenue alone. At least someone in China will be laughing at the end of the competition. \u00b7 Rogan Taylor, director of the football industry group at the University of Liverpool, is writing a book on Chinese football."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
