Marcos fell awkwardly in training and appeared unable to put weight on his right foot as he was helped back to the changing rooms. But Brazil's team doctor Jose Luis Runco said he should be fit to face Turkey: \"Marcos suffered a knock on his thigh in training. It's nothing serious and under normal circumstances he should train tomorrow, providing there is no swelling.\" Ronaldo insisted he was not trying to upstage David Beckham in the fashion stakes after turning up for training with a bizarre triangular hairstyle. \"It's a joke. I don't want to take Beckham's place. I try to look the way I want,\" the striker said. \"It is something new, something personal, there's nothing special about it. I cut it myself.\" Then, perhaps surprised by the general reaction, he asked: \"It's that bad, is it?\" As far as the rest of his body was concerned, Ronaldo played in a practice match for 30 minutes yesterday and said \"it felt fine, normal\". But when Runco was asked if he could guarantee that Ronaldo would play against Turkey and would be 100%, he said: \"No\". His team-mate Ronaldinho says he hopes his winning goal against England will not damage David Seaman's reputation. \"I really was very sad when I saw those images of Seaman crying on the television,\" he was quoted as saying. \"He is a great player with a great past. I don't think he could have done anything about the goal anyway. It wasn't a mistake and no one should blame him.\" Ronaldinho, who is suspended for tomorrow's game, also said he would like to leave his club Paris St-Germain for Internazionale of Italy. But Brazil's third \"R\" is going nowhere according to Barcelona. The club president Joan Gaspart said: \"Rivaldo will stay at Barcelona because [coach Louis] van Gaal has decided that he wants him.\" Rivaldo can expect a warm reception from the Turks after his play-acting led to the sending-off of Hakan Unsal in the group game between the two sides. The Turkish defender Alpay Ozalan said \"I think we'll take action accordingly. His actions were needless. If the ball had hit his chest I could understand the face thing, but the ball hit his knee.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
