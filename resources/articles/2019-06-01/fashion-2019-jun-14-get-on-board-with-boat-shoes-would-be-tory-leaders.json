Prada, Gucci and Saint Laurent all gave the leather drawstring style a contemporary update in new fabrics and bright colours at their spring/summer 2019 collections, prompting high-street options to pop up at Kurt Geiger, River Island and New Look. The popular online retailer Asos currently has 37 styles for sale. At the Pitti Uomo menswear showcase in Florence this week, they were also spotted at MSGM, Grenson and Fratelli Rossetti - meaning that this is a trend that is likely to run into next year too. It was John F Kennedy who first gave the boat shoe fashion credentials. \u201cJFK did for boat shoes then what Obama did for black nylon bombers at last week\u2019s North Carolina vs Duke basketball game,\u201d wrote GQ\u2019s style and grooming director, Teo van den Broeke, recently. \u201cHe made them look not only cool, but presidential too, a trick only a specifically handsome leader of the free world can ever truly achieve.\u201d While there\u2019s no suggestion that any of the Tory leadership candidates possess the pizazz of the famed American president, they might want to consider an up-to-date style, that also shows approachability. As footwear messaging goes, it couldn\u2019t be further away from Theresa May\u2019s spiky leopard-print kitten heels. \u201cBoat shoes could be a useful ploy for these male candidates,\u201d said fashion psychologist Dr Carolyn Mair. \u201cThey suggest relaxed confidence, which is an attractive characteristic for a future PM, and they are a way to show their pedigree subtly, without flaunting luxury which would be in poor taste. I would imagine that Eton alumni have several pairs already.\u201d Mair also notes the nostalgic appeal of a boat shoe \u2013 a sentiment that will surely appeal to the hardwired Brexiters among the candidates. \u201cNostalgia conjures bittersweet memories of the \u2018good old days\u2019 when life was less complex and more pleasant. Of course, nostalgia is a perception of life through rose-tinted glasses.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
