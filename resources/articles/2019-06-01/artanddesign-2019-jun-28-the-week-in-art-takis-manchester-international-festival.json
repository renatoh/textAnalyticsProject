Its theme of creepy voyeurism, with two old men spying on a young woman as she bathes, has both licensed nudity and allowed painters to express ambivalence about it. The baroque feminist painter Artemisia Gentileschi identified with Susanna, while some men, including Tintoretto and Rembrandt, also side with Susanna against her sleazy persecutors. This painting puts the onlooker in the position of an elder, apparently using the theme as a blatant excuse for an exhibition of naked flesh. But is it as simple as that? Susanna knows you are looking. She looks back, darkly. Hayez was a star in Milan when Gustave Courbet was pioneering realism in Paris. This painting has a modern, provocative matter-of-factness that makes it the Italian version of Manet\u2019s Olympia. \u2022 National Gallery, London Image of the week Hymn by Damien Hirst, Leeds city centre Yorkshire launched a new art festival, Yorkshire Sculpture International, which features a six-metre-high sculpture by the Leeds-raised YBA Damien Hirst.
