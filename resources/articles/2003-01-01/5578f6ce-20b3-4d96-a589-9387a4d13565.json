UpMyStreet works on a geographical concept that works well on public data linked to local authority boundaries. It doesn't work on ideas of \"neighbourhood\". The messageboards define closeness in linear distance, ignoring that most potent of London boundaries - the other side of the river. Patrick Wallace pat@pjw74og.u-net.com idTV pays out Dave Birch is on the money when he identifies interactive digital TV (idTV) as a valuable ecommerce stream (Secondsight, January 9). But idTV isn't just for small value transactions, and there's more to it than piggybacking sales from ads and trailers. Home shopping channels show that people make high value purchases when the goods themselves are the topic of the show. idTV is also well suited to big-ticket items because it targets groups of buyers rather than individuals. You can sell a holiday to a family gathered in the living room, because all the \"influencers\" are together and focused. Sellers can also use real-time feedback to show how many people are buying a specific item, so that wavering buyers get caught in a wave of enthusiasm. \"Lean back\" versus \"lean forward\" may indeed be a false debate for idTV - but the \"huddle together\" model bears serious thought. Paul May paul.may@verista.com Latin lovers The concept of a data black hole is nothing new (Digital dark age looms, January 9). One hundred years ago, the author Thomas Hardy commemorated his musical forebears with a plaque in Stinsford Church inscribed in Latin. This was because he believed the English language \"was liable to undergo great alterations\" but that the more archaic language would remain unchanged! Rod Warrington rlw@fish.co.uk Jabber works Rhianna Pratchett's Working the web on instant messaging (January 9, 2003) short-changed one of the most significant IM movements: Jabber (not \"Jabba'). Aside from being multi-platform and interoperable, it is also open source and easy to deploy, as Jack Schofield correctly noted here last year. IBM is now also on board with an emergency network for Washington DC built upon Jabber. Interested readers should check out www.jabber.org, which includes lists of numerous Jabber projects, clients, public servers, discussion forums on controversial topics such as AOL's claimed patent on Instant Messaging(!), and clients with innovative map interfaces such as Buddy Space. Professor Marc Eisenstadt Chief scientist, Knowledge Media Institute http://kmi.open.ac.uk Office politics Having forked out a load of money for a computer for my first year at uni, I found myself short of cash for buying MS Office. I set about trawling the net for an illegal download of MS Office only to stumble upon the Holy Grail of the Internet: OpenOffice.org - a free office suite! After waiting patiently for it to download, as BT has yet to upgrade my exchange, I hurriedly installed it. I can unequivocally say that it is equal to, and in some respects better than, MS Office and it is FREE! Thus having found and now used OpenOffice.org. I demand that Online make more of a big deal about its presence on the web! John Bolland j.bolland@btinternet.com Safety nets I suffer from paranoid schizophrenia and depression and find the net a gold mine of information. It is great to keep in touch with fellow sufferers through Yahoo Groups. I also do my grocery shopping and banking online. I have many friends online in the chatrooms and it is a great way to get things off your chest. If there are any mental health sufferers out there who are thinking or getting the net then I urge them to do so.
