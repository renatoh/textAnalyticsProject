I can see him now on the various corporate Christmas cards that surround my desk: round, laughing belly, shaking beard, rosy cheeks and a big old grin. But what, exactly, does he have to be so happy about? Actually, if you look closely, I'm sure you can detect a slightly crazed look about the eyes: like he's verging on the edge of nervous hysteria, or has been on Mother Christmas's gin since 8.37am. I can relate, and I've only got one office to think about. He's got the whole world. (Fortunately, most of the world wants an iPod Mini, so at least he can bulk-buy.) When I say I'm Santa in the office, of course I mean that I'm arranging the office Secret Santa - though there's nothing secret about that: everyone knows that if they end up with a duff present at the Christmas lunch and the whole festive season is ruined for them as a result, then it's all my fault. Secret Santa is, of course, supposed to be a simple system, understandable to even the most eggnog-fuddled brain. Everyone's name goes into the hat. Everyone takes out a name. Everyone buys a present (to the value of a pre-decided minimum) for the person whose name they have selected. Everyone has their anonymous present handed to them at the yuletide bash and everyone's happy and ooh-thanks-I-wonder-who-got-me-this? and let the festivities begin. Yes, put like that, I agree that it does sound simple. But I am here to tell you that it is anything but. For one thing, it takes some small measure of organisation, which would be minimal if my colleagues were reasonable creatures. But - as I think I may have mentioned before - they are not in any sense reasonable and contrive on an annual basis to misunderstand the most basic instructions. They break the rules of statistics and draw their own names from the hat. They want to swap who they're buying for because they've thought of a really good present for so-and-so. They forget to buy a present. They remember to buy a present, but at a result of completing that mammoth mental task, forget everything they have ever known about the personality, tastes and inclinations of the colleague they're buying for and end up delivering something so bizarre, inappropriate or tasteless that embarrassed silence is the only response. The tidings are, in short, of neither comfort nor joy. I understand why Father Christmas retires to the North Pole for the other 364 days of the year; I might leave a note in my stocking asking if he wants an extra elf."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
