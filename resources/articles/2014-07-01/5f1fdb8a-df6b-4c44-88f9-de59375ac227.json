General Mills on Monday detailed its new policy on its website, saying: \u201cThe imperative is clear: Business, together with governments, NGOs and individuals, needs to act to reduce the human impact on climate change.\u201d In a news release, Oxfam praised General Mills as \u201cthe first major food and beverage company to promise to implement long-term science-based targets to cut emissions from across all of its operations and supply chains that are responsive to the goal of keeping global temperature rise below 2C.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a major leap,\u201d said Heather Coleman, climate change manager for Oxfam America. With worldwide revenues of $17.9bn, Minnesota-based General Mills makes and sells food under such brands as Cheerios, Green Giant, Nature Valley, Pillsbury, Betty Crocker and Progressive. The next target for the activists is Kellogg\u2019s, General Mills\u2019 cereal-aisle rival, whose climate commitments so far have been more modest. Kellogg\u2019s didn\u2019t immediate respond to a request for comment. What\u2019s noteworthy about General Mills\u2019 new policy is its sweeping nature, as well as the company\u2019s willingness to get involved politically. Most companies in the food industry focus their sustainability work on their own factories and offices, at least in the beginning. But nearly two-thirds of the General Mills greenhouse gas emissions and 99% of its water use occurs upstream of its own factories, explained John Church, the company\u2019s executive vice president of supply chain operations, in a blogpost about the new policy. General Mills has worked to source more sustainably for years, focusing on such commodities as palm oil, vanilla and cocoa in the developing world and oats, wheat and sugar beets in North America. Now, though, General Mills says it will require \u201ckey ingredient suppliers to demonstrate environmental, social and economic improvements in their supply chains\u201d and commit to \u201cachieve zero net deforestation in high-risk supply chains by 2020\u201d. These new pledges will create incentives for big commodity producers such as Cargill and ADM to reduce their impact, and they \u2013 in turn \u2013 will likely work with farmers to improve their practices. This process of expanding the definition of corporate responsibility is similar to what has happened in the apparel and electronics industries, which over time have agreed \u2013 at least in theory \u2013 to accept responsibility for working conditions and environmental practices deep in their supply chains. On the political side, many companies have been reluctant to step out publicly on climate change, which remains a contentious issue. General Mills said it will join Nike, Starbucks, Timberland and Unilever in BICEP (Business for Innovative Climate &amp; Energy Policy), a climate-action lobbying project by the advocacy group Ceres. While it didn\u2019t call for any specific regulations, General Mills said: \u201cGovernment policies that provide for proportionate and clear guidance on mitigation and adaptation are essential for large-scale progress.\u201d Interestingly, General Mills cited its decision to join BICEP in its blogpost, but didn\u2019t mention Oxfam America, whose campaign generated 236,000 emails urging the company to act firmly on climate change. The company did not immediately respond to a phone message seeking comment on the Oxfam effort. But Oxfam\u2019s Heather Coleman said her group had been in contact with Jerry Lynch, General Mills\u2019 sustainability chief, even before the NGO published a report called Standing on the Sidelines: Why food and beverage companies must do more to tackle climate change, and General Mills shared a draft of the new policy before its release with Oxfam. \u201cWe\u2019ve had really productive conversations, with a lot of learning on both sides,\u201d Coleman said. Oxfam has also been talking with Kellogg\u2019s, the other target of what is often called a \u201crank \u2018em and spank \u2018em\u201d campaign. This week, as Kellogg\u2019s announces its quarterly earnings, Oxfam says it plans to take out a full-page ad in USA Today and buy banner ads on Bloomberg News to urge Kellogg\u2019s to act.
