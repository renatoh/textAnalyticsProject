South Wales will bear the brunt of the two-year programme of cuts, through the mothballing of virtually the whole of the Llanwern plant and the closure of the Ebbw Vale tinplate business. Sir Brian Moffat, the Corus chairman and acting chief executive, has summoned union leaders to his HQ in London's West End for a breakfast briefing. But he will provoke a storm of protest at the scale of the cutbacks - which include the closure of a core mill on Teeside - despite an unprecedented lobbying campaign led by Tony Blair. Downing Street yesterday expressed anger over the company's refusal to tell even the government details of its plans or exactly when it would make the announcement. \"It's a pretty extraordinary state of affairs where, as the government, if you were to ask us when is this decision going to be announced we would say we don't know,\" the Downing Street spokesman, Alastair Campbell, said. He contrasted Corus' attitude with the constructive talks between Whitehall and other firms engaged in major restructuring such as Vauxhall at Luton and BMW/Rover during the crisis in Longbridge last year. Industry sources said last night that Sir Brian had been rattled by the sheer intensity of the lobbying campaign but felt he had no alternative but to slash over-capacity brought about by shrinkage of the Britain's manufacturing base and a flood of cheap imports. Corus's UK operations lost at least \u00a3350m last year. The prime minister and senior colleagues, fearing that the thousands of job losses will damage Labour, have pulled out all the stops to convince Corus that the recent weakening of the pound against the euro and a decision by several car groups to increase output will ease the group's medium-term trading prospects. But Sir Brian is expected to press ahead with plans to shut virtually the entire Llanwern plant, keeping just some specialist units. Llanwern, employed 3,300 last summer, but could now be reduced to just a 600-strong workforce. The main steel union, the ISTC, will later today put flesh on plans for a consortium to take over the plant, despite Corus's initial rejection of its demand for talks on a buyout."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
