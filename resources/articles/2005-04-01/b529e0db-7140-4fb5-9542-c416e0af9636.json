Better known as a flesh-eating disease, the first signs of it are pretty innocuous, with weakness and muscle pain making it easy to confuse with flu. But the bacteria move swiftly. Within a few days, the skin around the site of infection begins to swell and redden and then, later, blackens and blisters like a burning sausage. The only cure is drastic. You have to cut out all the infected tissue, and even then antibiotics are required to prevent the bacteria gaining another foothold. If left to their own devices, the toxins which the bacteria pump into the body push it into shock; blood pressure plummets and major organs fail. Even with treatment, about one in five patients will die. Until recently, the condition fitted the category of gruesome but not particularly newsworthy. But that changed last week when medics in California reported a cluster of cases with dire implications. What alarmed them was not so much the disease itself, but what was causing it. Records show almost all necrotising fasciitis has been caused by streptococcal bacteria. The Californian cases were being caused by the different bug Staphylococcus aureus; and, worse than that, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. These people had MRSA, the notorious hospital superbug. Yet none of the sufferers had been near a hospital, or even a recently discharged patient, before the infections struck. In isolation, this flurry of cases might be considered to be a freak occurrence, but in fact it is only the most recent in a series of reports of MRSA causing serious disease and sometimes death among young, healthy people. In the US, at least, it is now recognised that MRSA is not confined to hospitals. Staphylococcus aureus, known to microbiologists as \"Staph\", is carried on the skin and around the nostrils of a third of us at any one time. You may well be colonised by it even as you read these words. Now some of these strains carried by healthy people with no connections to hospitals have also become resistant to the frontline drugs that would normally kill them outright. \"If you look at the history of outbreaks, it's very clear that the biology of MRSA has changed. There's been a new strain of MRSA emerge in the community, independently of that found in healthcare settings,\" says Scott Fridkin, a world expert on so-called community-acquired MRSA at the prestigious US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia. According to many scientists, MRSA in the community has done more than simply emerge. \"Specific strains of it are spreading like crazy in the US,\" says Francoise Perdreau-Remington, of the University of California, San Francisco and co-author of the recent New England Journal of Medicine report on necrotising fasciitis. One strain, known as USA300, was only identified in 2000, but has now spread to at least 13 states and even been picked up in other countries, notably the Netherlands. \"This was non-existent before 2000. Now it's taking over,\" says Perdreau-Remington. \"The way it's spread in the US so far, it's going to go abroad, no question, and it might well go round the world.\" If it does, it won't be the first time a Staph has gone global. In the 1950s, before the antibiotics we use today had even been invented, a particular strain emerged which was associated with serious infections in the community and particularly very young babies. First noticed in Australia, it then caused a pandemic as it spread around the world, before finally disappearing in the face of the new drugs (among them meticillin, formerly known as methicillin) introduced in the 1960s. But now it is back. Earlier this month, scientists at Bath University identified a strain of community MRSA as its close relative and likely descendant. The only difference between the two, they say, is that the new strain is far more virulent. \"It's difficult to see why it won't spread just like it did in the 1950s. It's a very aggressive strain and it's much more transmissible than others that are out there,\" says Mark Enright, who led the research. When cases of MRSA in the wider community were first noticed, it was widely assumed that these must be strains that had escaped from hospitals. And while there are occasional infections caused by MRSA hitching a ride out of hospital on discharged patients, most experts are now convinced that community strains of MRSA are overwhelmingly different beasts from those found in hospitals. MRSA strains in hospitals have adapted to their very distinct environment. Widespread use of a range of antibiotics initially wiped out nearly every kind of Staph in the healthcare setting. But those that managed to survive and replicate produced ever hardier strains that now can take almost anything doctors throw at them. Although still referred to as \"meticillin-resistant\", they are usually resistant to many other antibiotics as well. Beyond the wards though, hospital strains of MRSA struggle to survive. Out on the street, potential hosts are more likely to have decent immune systems, and transmission opportunities are different. Survival skills essential for life outside the ward, such as growing fast on human skin, have declined through generations of easy living - with a steady supply of vulnerable hosts, and healthcare workers too busy to wash their hands transferring the bug from patient to patient. And all that resistance is utterly useless in the absence of the antibiotic. It is the microbial equivalent of donning a suit of armour and a lance to help fight your way on to a bus. You might just be able to move, but leaner locals will run rings around you. This difference is confirmed by genetic studies of MRSA in the hospital and outside in the community. Hospital strains have many resistance genes in order to protect them against the barrage of antibiotics they are likely to encounter, whereas their community cousins have very few. Those they do have are limited, unsurprisingly, to the most common antibiotics used by GPs. Even here though, the two types of bacteria use different genes to achieve the same effect, underlining that they are separate entities. This is the good news: it is pretty easy to find an antibiotic with which to treat MRSA in the community. But doctors do have to be switched on to the problem and realise they might be facing an MRSA. The danger is real. Between 1997 and 1999, health departments in Minnesota and North Dakota reported that four children died from community-acquired MRSA. Since emerging in Britain, community MRSA has killed a 28-year old woman. Ruth Lynfield, at the Minnesota Department of Health, in Minneapolis, points out that this could waste vital time when fighting a serious, potentially fatal infection such as necrotising fasciitis or pneumonia. \"We can advise people to keep wounds clean and get infections checked out quickly, but really, it's the clinicians who need to be aware that they might be dealing with MRSA,\" she says. In the US, scientists are openly calling community MRSA an epidemic. It is hard to argue with that when in parts of the country MRSA makes up as many as 60% of the Staphs in the community. But while health officials there are moving on to a war footing, Britain appears to be playing a waiting game. The US reported community-acquired MRSA as early as 1998, but the first case on these shores was identified only three years ago, according to the government's Health Protection Agency. Since then, only about 100 cases have been logged, including one death. But despite signs that MRSA could potentially become a bigger story outside hospitals than in them, there is no early warning system in place. To spot an emerging problem you have to go and look for MRSA colonising healthy people. At present, suspected cases of community-acquired MRSA are reported to the agency only after patients have been admitted to hospital with severe infections. \"There's no specific surveillance system to look for community MRSA, but if we had a particular problem with it, I'm sure we'd know about it,\" says a spokeswoman for the HPA. Not everyone is so sanguine. \"Cases are going up in every country that is properly looking for it, but we're not looking for it. Everyone's eyes are on hospitals and waiting lists and this is just not on the radar,\" says Enright. \"It's something that really needs to be monitored because it has the potential to be devastating. The picture in the US is that this is rampaging. We'll get this, it's going to happen here in the same way as the States.\" What is hard to understand is why community MRSA typically strikes younger people. Ruth Lynfield has an explanation. Older people tend to get fewer cuts and abrasions, and have fewer close contacts with other people, which are necessary for transmission of the bacteria. Also, they are likely to already have Staph thriving on their bodies, so invaders struggle to gain a foothold. \"Children who have yet to pick it up are more likely to get the newer strains going round now,\" she says. Most infections are believed to result from a fresh cut or graze which gets contaminated by MRSA already growing elsewhere on the body, for example in the nostrils. As if you needed telling, it's a bad idea to pick your nose and then rub the proceeds in an open wound. Intriguingly, when it comes down to the task of limiting the spread of community MRSA, Britain's nationalised health service might be our ace in the hole, and not only through treating sufferers. In the US, privatised medical care means that more antibiotics get dished out to patients, as sure a strategy as any to encourage the emergence of drug-resistant bugs. \"And in terms of combating it, countries such as Britain with national healthcare at least have some control over what is prescribed,\" says Lynfield. By scaling back on certain antibiotics, it might be possible to reduce levels of community MRSA, she says. Just such a trick, to reduce another drug-resistant bug, worked a treat in Finland in the late 1990s. Regardless of the measures taken, as long as antibiotics are being used, drug-resistant strains of bugs will emerge, and eventually, drug resistance will become the norm. \"I don't see this getting any less of a problem,\" says Lynfield. \"Everyday contact spreads Staph. You can tell people to wash their hands and all those things, but Staph is always going to be with us and if the strains out there happen to be resistant to antibiotics, then that is what we'll all be picking up.\" If this is so, maybe we should be more worried about people bringing the disease into hospital, than taking it home with them. As Brad Spellberg, one of the doctors who documented the Californian cases of necrotising fasciitis, says: \"Our old, lumbering, oafish multidrug-resistant hospital- acquired MRSA is being outcompeted in hospitals by this new, lean, mean, MRSA machine. We are no longer seeing the old MRSA in our hospitals. It's all this newer, more virulent type.\" Further reading Facts and advice on community-acquired MRSA from the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention: www.cdc.gov/ncidod/hip/Aresist/ca_mrsa.htm UK Health Protection Agency statement on community MRSA: http://masl.to/?G30812FDA Recent research tracing MRSA across Europe: http://masl.to/?A25861FDA MRSA watch - a compilation of articles about MRSA from around the world: http://masl.to/?G3B822FDA"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
