He loves his Ferrari, he just does not want to be seen driving it. \"It's great, an unbelievable car,\" he says. \"I really, really enjoy it. I just don't like getting out of it [in public]. I guess you could say it's a poser's car and I don't like drawing attention to myself. I love driving the car, I just don't like what goes with it. So I don't really drive it ... as much as I would like to.\" As a metaphor for his career and the state of his game, the Ferrari parked in the garage ready to be unleashed at full throttle on the open road is near perfect. Murray has a great game inside him, fighting to get out, but the urge to express himself fully on court, to red-line it when the chequered flag is in sight, is tempered by risk aversion honed over many years of hitting a yellow ball over a 3ft\u2011high net into a rectangle measuring 39ft by 27ft in the expectation that, eventually, it will not come back to him and he will have won the point. Many good judges say a version of this strategy cost him whatever chance he had against an inspired Roger Federer in the Australian Open final in January, when Murray declined a simple volley to finish off a point at a break up in the third set. He was similarly reticent when leading in the tie\u2011break and the moment vanished before his lachrymose eyes. Murray is naturally diffident, as well. It is almost as if he wants to play tennis without being noticed. Although he has played some amazing shots in matches, he rarely goes for the big winner, the spectacular game-changer, in the way, say, Robin Soderling did so relentlessly in blasting Federer away at Roland Garros this year, or Rafael Nadal does almost without thinking. Why, say his friends and doubters, is this so? Certainly, part of Murray dreads the consequences of his excellence. Asked has he ever thought what it would be like to win Wimbledon, he says: \"I don't really want to think what would happen. It's life\u2011changing. It would be very, very difficult and something you'd have to learn to live with, but I think I want to do it.\" The first of seven obstacles to that end at this 133rd edition of the tournament is the 26-year-old Czech clay-courter Jan Hajek, rated 80th in the world and a relatively safe opening opponent tomorrow, given he went out on his debut here in the first round last year and has won only eight of 21 matches in 2010. Yet Murray will afford Hajek the same professional's attention he would Nadal, whom he might meet in the semi-finals, or Federer, the man who has ruined two grand slam finals for him. Few are more deeply steeped in the science and art of tennis than Murray. Few are more aware that it is a dangerous place to be self-indulgent with your skills. So patrolling the baseline and waiting for the right angle and moment will work for him more often than not, because of the strength and depth of his return and the wicked power and precision he brings to his backhand. He acknowledges the conundrum of mixing aggression and patience, and concedes he has not got the percentages right since his wonderful run in Australia at the start of the year. At one point in his fledgling career, Murray looked like he might go through more coaches than National Express. But he seems settled with Alex Corretja, in his second spell, and Miles Maclagan. When they brainstormed last weekend, they came to a unanimous decision: Andy needs to come to the net more often. \"For me to feel comfortable doing it,\" Murray says, \"I need to spend a lot of time practising it. Once I get to the net, I feel relatively natural, but it's about the transition, and making sure you pick the right times to come forward. That's something that I've been working on a lot the past week: approach shots, hitting returns and coming in behind them. \"It's not something you can teach. It's something that I need to practise a lot and it's something that can work very well on the grass. I felt I had the mix right at the Australian Open and the Hopman Cup. I played some really nice tennis at the net. My tennis since then hasn't been particularly good but it wasn't down to my transition game. It was the basics and the other things that I normally do well that haven't been as good.\" Murray is fighting on two fronts: with himself and, if he gets the chance, against two of the finest players ever to grace the game, Federer and Nadal. He thinks he is at least winning the first fight. \"I do love tennis, and I've made a lot of sacrifices to play the sport. It's a difficult sport when you're younger but, also, it isn't the most important thing in my life. I've said that for the last three or four years. My family, friends and whatnot are the most important things to me.\" Nevertheless, there is work to do. How does he assess the field of champions surrounding him on his own turf? \"It's difficult. Roger had only lost one match on grass in seven years before he lost to [Lleyton] Hewitt [last weekend in Halle]. It's a pretty incredible record. So he's obviously going to be favourite going into Wimbledon, but then you could say he's beaten Hewitt 15 times in a row \u2013 so that [defeat] was a bit surprising. \"[Andy] Roddick always plays very well at Queen's, but didn't this year. And Rafa, you wouldn't expect him to lose to [Feliciano] L\u00f3pez at Queen's, but he could have been a bit tired. So it's very difficult. I don't really know. Rafa will probably go in the most confident, because of the results that he's had and being No1 in the world, but it's tough to look into grass-court form. It's only one tournament, really.\" Murray insists, anyway, that it is pointless to scan the draw for demons. What matters is the opponent at the other end of the court on a given day. No matter who it is, Murray sees his challenge as getting his own game right. He is self-contained to an impressive degree. \"I used a sports psychologist once. I didn't really find it that beneficial. I didn't discuss many things that were going on out on the court. It ended up being about what was going on off the court, what's going on with the people you're working with and it tends to come down to a small problem. \"I never worked with someone [after that] because I think a lot of them say the same thing. I don't think counting to 10 helps when you're playing in the semi-finals of a grand slam on the Centre Court of Wimbledon against one of the best athletes in the world. It's not that simple. Unless you've played this sport, it's very difficult to teach people how to think when they're out there.\" It might just be time to stop thinking for a bit and get the Ferrari out again."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
