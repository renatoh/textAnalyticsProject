But even the cornerstone of Sir Phillip Green\u2019s retail empire is in need of urgent repair. \u201cIt reminds me of a very nice Marks &amp; Spencer from 20 years ago,\u201d says James Clark of the London College of Fashion as he walks around the six-floor Topshop and Topman site on London\u2019s Oxford Street. While the trendy Urban Outfitters next door has festival-ready outfits such as floaty dresses and flowery shirts with reusable water bottles, Topshop\u2019s mannequins look as if they are dressed for a wedding or parents\u2019 barbecue. \u201cIt seems a bit culturally adrift, a bit white middle class. If it\u2019s aiming at a young street demographic of conscious consumerism,\u201d Clark says. Once a fashion leader, featured in Vogue with celebrities clamouring to attend its catwalk shows, Topshop and Topman have lost their edge and seem confused about who they are targeting. Green admitted to the BBC on Thursday that Arcadia, the retail group behind Topshop and other high street brands, might not have reacted quickly enough to a market that has changed \u201cfundamentally\u201d. He said: \u201cWhether we haven\u2019t changed quickly enough or we had too many shops or whatever, I think it\u2019s a combination of a lot of things. The answer is you can\u2019t get it all right.\u201d If the flagship store is aimed at under 40s \u2013 the millenials and generation Z \u2013 then there are few references to the themes that run close to their heart: sustainability; multi-cultural urban life; and gender-fluidity. There is no link to the online world of selfies and sharing your shopping \u201chaul\u201d. Hannah Middleton, a lecturer in fashion buying at the London College of Fashion, says: \u201cGeneration Z like a connection with a story that they can tap into. There is no evidence of that and our students are aware of Green. Even secondary school students I have worked with say they won\u2019t go into Starbucks because it doesn\u2019t pay tax. They are aware of what is going on in a way my generation perhaps wasn\u2019t and react accordingly.\u201d While the Oxford Street site houses a hairdressers, a brow bar and a Benugo cafe, it is a long way from the multi-faceted destination store that Primark recently opened in Birmingham, which had at least one fun food or beauty service on every floor. And that store lays bare Arcadia\u2019s challenge. Primark reportedly spent \u00a370m on the shop, while Arcadia has just \u00a375m set aside to revamp hundreds of sites as part of a \u00a3135m turnaround plan. If the Topshop and Topman London flagship needs work, there are many smaller dowdier shops around the country that must struggle to make a profit. It also has six other brands \u2013 Wallis, Miss Selfridge, Evans, Burton, Dorothy Perkins and Outfit \u2013 that have drifted even more off course than the two leading labels. This week, Green won approval from creditors for a restructure that will enable Arcadia to close an initial 50 stores, out of an estate of 570 standalone units, and cut rents on nearly 200 more, with the loss of 1,000 jobs. Topshop has more than 300 outlets in the UK, including standalone sites. But the store, rent and jobs cull will only help boost profits in the short term. Arcadia will have to take some even tougher decisions in the years ahead if it wants to last. Trimming down the eight brands in his Arcadia empire and closing many more stores should be top of the list. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty likely that decisions are being taken about closing one to four different chains rather than keep all these balls up in the air in a market where there is no stopping the growth of online,\u201d says independent retail analyst Nick Bubb. \u201cThe advance of Primark and online has been [Green\u2019s] death knell.\u201d Miss Selfridge and Evans are already set to close most of their stores and focus on selling online or via wholesale. Maureen Hinton, an analyst at retail research firm GlobalData said Green needed to focus on Topshop and Topman: \u201cThose are the ones that have fallen less far. If they had the right person running them with vision on brand and understanding the target market you could recover those brands.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
