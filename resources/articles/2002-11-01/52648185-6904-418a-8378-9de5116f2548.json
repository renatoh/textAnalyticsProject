These are special times for Welsh football.\" Cardiff's Danny Gabbidon may not make it in Azerbaijan this afternoon but, should his team-mates overcome Group Nine's whipping boys to open up a five-point advantage at the top, he and Wales might still make it to Portugal in two years' time. Hughes's side are unbeaten in 14 months and seven matches; even with a squad robbed of seven regulars, the Boyos are buoyant. \"You can sense the confidence, that the lads are enjoying going back to their clubs wearing their Welsh shirts,\" said Hughes, who played his squad a video re-run of last month's 2-1 success over Italy on Sunday. \"It's a good time to be a Welsh international and players and managers alike come up to me and say well done. But we've still got a lot of work to do.\" Welsh supporters need no reminding of that. Scarred by previous failure, they have not allowed themselves much optimism since Paul Bodin placed the ball on the spot, strode back to the edge of the area with the scores level at 1-1 in a hushed Cardiff Arms Park and aimed high to beat the Romanian goalkeeper. That was on November 17 1993. The full-back's attempt clipped the bar, Wales conceded a late second and, having needed to win to secure a passage to USA 94, were out. Back-to-back fixtures against the Azeri smack of a potential six-point haul, though there is caution too. Hughes recalled with a shudder a 5-0 drubbing in the apparent backwater of Georgia in 1994. \"But we weren't very well informed when we went there, and that won't be the case here,\" said Hughes. \"I like to give my players an insight. We've got a squad that has been together for a long time and the lads who come in will know exactly what I expect of them. Players like Danny and Robert Earnshaw are good characters who have proved their quality. We'll need that. This game is as difficult, if not more so, than the Italy game last month.\" Not that the turmoil engulfing the Azeri suggests as much. The coach Asker Abdulaev - the team's third manager this year - returned to the helm for a second time last month after Vagif Sadikhov resigned having been robbed of a domestic championship in which to assess his side. All but one of the 12 top-flight clubs withdrew from the league in May in protest at alleged corruption by the Azerbaijani Football Federation, though their breakaway set-up has since disintegrated. That has left most of the players with sporadic friendlies in which to sharpen a competitive edge, and a 2-0 win against the Turkish second division side Antalyaspor last week did little to encourage Abdulaev. \"We'll just have to cling to Allah,\" he said glumly. \"Nobody in this country cares about football except the coaches.\" Wales should be more inconvenienced by the pollution engulfing the Tofik Bakhramov Stadium than the opposition, although Hughes warned: \"It's still very early. We've had a wonderful start, better than we could have hoped for. Now we must aim to go into the new year with a full compliment of points.\" Azerbaijan (4-5-1; probable): Hasanzade; Kerimov, Yadullayev, Akhmedov, Niftaliyev; Imamaliev, Asadov, Sadigov, M Gurbanov, Musayev; G Gurbanov. Wales (4-5-1; probable): Jones (Southampton); Delaney (Aston Villa), Melville (Fulham), Gabbidon (Cardiff), Barnard (Grimsby); Earnshaw (Cardiff), Davies (Tottenham), Robinson (Portsmouth), Speed (Newcastle), Giggs (Manchester United); Hartson (Celtic)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
