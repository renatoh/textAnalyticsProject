The move follows last week's sudden resignation by Assistant Commissioner Andy Hayman. Commander John McDowall, who joined the Metropolitan police in 1980, takes over the role previously held by Deputy Assistant Commissioner Peter Clarke. Clarke, who was due to retire shortly, is staying on temporarily to fill the gap left by Hayman's departure. A replacement is still being sought for Hayman. McDowall takes over the \u00a3125,000-a-year job at a delicate time. The Met's handling of events leading up to the death of the young Brazilian was heavily criticised, both by the Independent Police Complaints Commission and in court during the Met's prosecution under health and safety legislation. Last week, Hayman announced his resignation following allegations about expenses and his contacts with a member of the IPCC staff, which he claimed were part of a smear campaign against him. The Met commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, welcomed the appointment. \"The enduring threat from international terrorism makes this one of the most demanding posts in UK policing and I'm confident the police authority has chosen the right individual for this role,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
