If Monday night\u2019s game at Leicester City may come too early for the Spaniard\u2019s new charges to take command on the pitch, power has already been restored to the manager\u2019s office. And if Steve McClaren was, in far too many ways, a puppet of a rigid club hierarchy overseen by Mike Ashley, the owner, the former England coach\u2019s successor has already made it subtly clear that he intends to be the man doing the dictating. Ben\u00edtez is most definitely not the type to be dominated by Lee Charnley, Newcastle\u2019s managing director, and Graham Carr, the chief scout. McClaren, sacked on Friday morning, was handed certain players he did not want \u2013 most notably Florian Thauvin and Aleksandar Mitrovic, by Carr. Equally damagingly, the former England coach was not supplied with the left-back, a proven goalscorer and high-calibre centre-half he needed. It is hard to envisage the former Liverpool, Chelsea and Real Madrid manager putting up with anything similar. \u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to him [Carr] yet but I know him,\u201d said Ben\u00edtez during his unveiling in a packed St James\u2019 Park media room on Saturday afternoon. \u201cI don\u2019t see any problem. He\u2019s a football man, we\u2019ll talk about football, we\u2019ll talk about players and I think we\u2019ll be fine. I understand why the club is going in this direction but I have to explain why we have to change a little bit. I think that will be good for everyone. \u201cThey [the board] will try to bring the best players for me. If I\u2019m here it is because they trust me, they want to listen to me, they want to improve and want to do things in a certain way.\u201d Ben\u00edtez has found an ally in Alan Shearer, the former Newcastle striker, captain and, briefly, manager. \u201cAlan Shearer loves the club,\u201d he said. \u201cHe told me: \u2018If you do well it will be amazing. If you need me or want to know anything, about the city, the fans, everything, you can always ask.\u2019 He was great, he was really good.\u201d The pair have arranged to meet for further discussions over a lunch in which any flies on the wall are surely in for a most informative time. Shearer\u2019s views on Fabricio Coloccini, Newcastle\u2019s Argentinian captain and a figure who appeared to undermine McClaren, should certainly be intriguing. Coloccini is currently recovering from injury, dictating that Jonjo Shelvey, a \u00a312m January buy from Swansea and the last player Ben\u00edtez purchased (from Charlton) as Liverpool manager, will almost certainly wear the armband at the King Power Stadium. Significantly, McClaren\u2019s successor \u2013 who likes and admires his Leicester counterpart, Claudio Ranieri \u2013 has made an immediate point of singling out the dressing room\u2019s two obvious leaders for priority chats. \u201cI\u2019ve been talking with Shelvey, Coloccini,\u201d Ben\u00edtez said. \u201cWe had some meetings together, talking about tactics and other things. \u201cI have individual conversations, face-to-face, with some players. Coloccini was one. On Saturday we had a tactical training session. We were doing some movements I would like to do in the future so he came outside to see what we were doing and I was talking with him. He was really confident the team is good and will do well.\u201d Nonetheless, it must represent quite a culture shock to a man who so recently coached Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale in Madrid to suddenly find himself choreographing Emmanuel Rivi\u00e8re, Gabriel Obertan and company. Accordingly someone suggested that, this time last year, Ben\u00edtez might have been somewhat underwhelmed by the prospect of managing Newcastle. \u201cIf I am like I am now, convinced, I would be delighted, why not?\u201d he replied. \u201cI am someone that analyses things in a certain way. The Premier League teams are so big and they will be even bigger. So when you see a team like Newcastle, with all the potential, you say: \u2018We can improve things, we can be very big.\u2019 I am convinced I can do it. But I need to concentrate on the next 10 games. I think we\u2019re one of the most important teams in the Premier League but we have to stay in the Premier League.\u201d This task is complicated by the double-edged nature of Newcastle\u2019s problems. \u201cWe have to improve both parts of our game in attack and also in defence,\u201d said Ben\u00edtez. \u201cWe have to do both things at the same time.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
