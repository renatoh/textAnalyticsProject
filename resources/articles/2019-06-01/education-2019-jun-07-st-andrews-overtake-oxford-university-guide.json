But not only has St Andrews thrived for centuries, it\u2019s done so on its own terms. In recent years, it has embraced the equality and diversity agenda to widen its student intake, without joining the corporate dash for growth seen among its peers in London, Birmingham and Bristol. Now, for the first time since the Guardian University Guide of 2003, St Andrews has disrupted the Oxbridge duopoly, overtaking Oxford to be ranked second overall among UK universities, thanks in part to its academic excellence, but also to its track record in student achievement before and after graduation. \u201cWe think it\u2019s remarkable that a small university like St Andrews \u2013 which has a miniscule endowment in comparison to those of Oxford and Cambridge \u2013 competes so effectively with them,\u201d says Sally Mapstone, principal and vice-chancellor. Before coming to St Andrews, Mapstone was at Oxford, starting out as an undergraduate at Wadham College and later completing a doctorate on medieval Scots literature. Her academic career there culminated in one of the university\u2019s most senior posts: that of a pro-vice chancellor. But in 2016, Oxford named the then St Andrews principal Louise Richardson as its new VC, and Mapstone went in the opposite direction as her replacement. \u201cI think St Andrews has many of the qualities of Oxford and Cambridge, although it\u2019s not a collegiate university. It\u2019s a small, highly international university. It has things in common with them, but it is also dramatically different,\u201d Mapstone says. \u201cI don\u2019t really like these \u2018is X as good as Y?\u2019 questions. But can St Andrews be counted in the company of Oxford and Cambridge? Yes, I think we are showing it can.\u201d While St Andrews has always been highly ranked, in the latest table it overtakes Oxford by a sliver, helped by outstanding performances in some of its traditional strengths, such as economics. Adding value St Andrews students are among the happiest with their courses and the quality of the teaching on offer, with more than 90% of current students saying they are satisfied. And a very high proportion of them go on to employment or further study after graduation, thanks to the emphasis the university puts on career initiatives such as internships. St Andrews also outdoes its Oxbridge rivals on improving and adding value to the academic performance of its students, partly because of the success of its widening participation schemes, some of which are more radical than even the latest announcements from Oxbridge envisage. According to its most recent figures, nearly 50% of the undergraduates St Andrews admitted from Scotland were eligible for contextual offers that relax entry requirements for students because of their background or family circumstances. That increase \u2013 from one in three Scottish students admitted five years ago \u2013 has been the result of a determined effort to meet access targets set by the Scottish government. For several years, the university has been offering so-called \u201cgateway programmes\u201d, a profoundly different route into some of its most academically demanding courses, including medicine and physics, for students who otherwise would struggle to get a look-in. These programmes offer sharply reduced entry criteria for Scottish applicants and take advantage of the longer four-year undergraduate degree in Scotland by using the first year to bring disadvantaged students up to speed. They continue the remainder of the course alongside their peers. \u201cThe key thing is that it isn\u2019t just about recruiting people, it\u2019s about supporting them while they\u2019re here. Helping our students to flourish is one of the distinctive things people may not realise about what we do here,\u201d Mapstone says. The Scottish government\u2019s targets are challenging: 20% of each institution\u2019s intake must come from Scotland\u2019s most deprived areas. Mapstone endorses the goal, but admits it is tough, with St Andrews competing for potential applicants against its national rivals. St Andrews\u2019s strong reputation as an elite institution can hamper its efforts to widen access. \u201cI entirely recognise that St Andrews is associated with history and tradition, and with a certain style of person. But what our new strategy is seeking to convey is that we welcome all styles of people,\u201d Mapstone says. \u201cSt Andrews should be better known for its inclusivity and its diversity. Last year we were at the Pink News awards because we were nominated in the public sector category for our LGBTQ+ engagement. We\u2019re very proud of our record on LGBTQ+ issues, but would people automatically associate St Andrews with that? No they wouldn\u2019t, but that is part of the community we have here.\u201d Lucy Hunter Blackburn, an independent observer of Scottish higher education based in Edinburgh, says: \u201cOfficial monitoring only looks at Scottish students, so ignores the relatively advantaged demographic of the fee-paying ones \u2013 from the rest of UK and overseas \u2013 which may have some impact on the university\u2019s ability to attract recruits from a broader background.\u201d St Andrews recruits heavily in England\u2019s schools, both state and independent, and receives around 10 applications for every place awarded, with few apparently dissuaded by the additional cost in money and time that a four-year degree requires. The royal connection Applications from outside Europe are also strong, from India and \u2013 unusually for a British university \u2013 the US. Part of the reason is St Andrews\u2019s international reputation as the university that educated Prince William, who met fellow student Kate Middleton there. \u201cIt gave St Andrews a certain status, because people are so interested in the royal family,\u201d says Mapstone. \u201cI think also because Prince William and Catherine espouse the sorts of causes we believe in: sustainability, mental health care. We believe in a combination of formal and informal here, and I think they encapsulate that.\u201d Paloma Paige, the president of St Andrews\u2019s students association, says her decision to come here from California had nothing to do with the royal graduates and everything to do with the quality of the international relations degree she wanted to study. \u201cUS universities are far more lecture-based, students take copious notes, and it all seems very restricted. Here you get to take the initiative. It\u2019s smaller, but there\u2019s a lot of diversity among staff and students,\u201d Paige says. \u201cIt\u2019s not posh. In fact, I was surprised at how \u2018un-British\u2019 it was. The institutional diversity means you\u2019ll find people accept you, no matter who you are.\u201d Paige is an example of Mapstone\u2019s maxim: \u201cWhere people identify quality they will seek it out.\u201d Asked if the university\u2019s remoteness and size are barriers to recruitment for staff or students, Mapstone responds that application rates continue to rise from all parts of the UK. \u201cIt\u2019s not in the North Pole. I wouldn\u2019t say it was profoundly remote. You have to make an effort to get here, but everyone who does thinks it\u2019s worth it. It\u2019s less than 90 minutes from an international airport, so let\u2019s not overdo the remoteness.\u201d Admissions director Julie Ramsay says when recruiting in the south of England, she has encountered hesitation about the journey \u2013 not from students but from their parents. \u201cIt\u2019s the parents who will take me to one side and ask, \u2018I\u2019m worried about my child going to Scotland, what\u2019s it like up there?\u2019\u201d Regardless of its location, St Andrews could fill its places many times over. While the number of Scottish students \u2013 who pay no tuition fees \u2013 is fixed by the Scottish government, it could copy its English counterparts and fill its halls and coffers with many more students from England, each paying \u00a39,250 a year. But that sort of rapid growth, according to Mapstone, is not an option for St Andrews, in a town of just 17,000 people with the North Sea on one side and farmland on the other. \u201cWe don\u2019t intend to go beyond 10,000 students; we\u2019re around 9,000 at the moment. Our reason for that is a simple one: we\u2019re in this beautiful Fife town and we have limited capacity, but also we think 10,000 students is about right for the kind of education we offer and the way we offer it.\u201d Get your Guardian University Guide 2020 print supplement free with Saturday\u2019s Guardian 8 June"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
