Few riders are as quietly effective as the 22-year-old, who has reached three figures in each of the last two seasons having won the apprentices' championship in 2003. Horses seem to enjoy running for him, and it is noticeable how frequently his mounts perform much better than the market expects. The two feature races at Newmarket yesterday, where the Craven meeting concluded, were an obvious case in point. While Moore did not quite manage to get either Metropolitan Man or Silver Blue home in front, a pair of unfussy, well judged and clever rides saw them finish second and third respectively in the Craven Stakes and Fielden Stakes. At odds of 16-1 and 40-1, it was quite an each-way double. It was clear from an early stage that Moore was a jockey who could get a job done, and his rapid rise towards the top of his profession shows no sign of losing its momentum. When he was growing up at the yard of his father, the trainer Gary Moore, though, he was more interested in playing football than riding racehorses. \"I had riding lessons from the age of five, and my dad always said that I was a very natural rider,\" he says, \"but it was my brother Jamie [now a successful jump jockey] who always wanted to be a jockey more than me. He worked a lot harder at it than I did, because I was always thinking about football. \"But I was riding out racehorses for my grandad [Charlie Moore] and my dad when I was 11. Later on, he made sure that I went to the right place when I joined Richard Hannon, who has been really good to me. The season after I was champion apprentice should have been the hardest one of all, but Mr Hannon gave me lots of good rides and instead I had over 130 winners.\" Charlie Moore, a former car dealer who trained horses next to Brighton racecourse, was one of the most colourful and garrulous characters that the southern circuit has seen. His grandson may never match him in terms of quick-fire gags and anecdotes - few could - but grandad Moore, who died six years ago, would be proud to see the racing dynasty that he founded extending into a third generation. \"He was a real character and a big help to me,\" Moore says, \"and fortunately I rode a handful of winners before he died, including one that was in his colours.\" In the earliest part of Moore's fledgling career there were concerns that his weight could eventually become an issue, and the fact that his brother took the jumping route also seemed significant. Back then, too, he admits that Tony McCoy and Richard Dunwoody were the riders he most admired. However, he remains confident that the scales will not defeat him, particularly if, as so many jockeys hope, the minimum weight for riding on the Flat is raised towards 8st 4lb in the near future. \"When I first started out and I was claiming 7lb, it was a massive struggle,\" he says, \"but luckily my claim started to come down pretty fast and I can do 8st 6lb without any trouble now, so I'm quite lucky. Of course, I'd like to see the weights go up, but my weight really isn't an issue.\" If, as he suspects, the championship eludes him this year, then a first Group One victory would be a fair consolation. Moore has finished second on The Tatling in three Group Ones, and never by more than a neck, while he was also a narrow runner-up on Galeota in a Group One at the Royal meeting last summer. \"Galeota would be one horse that I'm really looking forward to riding this year,\" he says. \"He's got to bounce back after a couple of poor runs at the end of last season - but if he does, you'd hope that he'd nearly be champion sprinter.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
