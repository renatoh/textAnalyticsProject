Today they must unveil half year profits and lay out the probably grisly results of a business review conducted by KPMG. If that wasn't bad enough, then what happens? Mr David Jones, shareholder champion, one-man corporate governance watchdog and - worst of all - Morrisons deputy chairman, suddenly finds himself with more time on his hands. More time to spend in Bradford maybe? More time to work on his dratted Morrisons succession plan. Stepping down from the chair of Next, he is now free to take another FTSE-100 chairmanship. Morrisons perhaps? At least it would put an end to the constant speculation about who will succeed Sir Ken. That said, Mr Jones's departure from Next is a textbook lesson in how to conduct a handover. He will have been chairman for four years and before that did a year as deputy chairman. Chairman elect John Barton will be moving up from the deputy role. The previous chairmen - Brian Pitman and Lord Wolfson - were also deputy chairmen first. Mr Jones's successor as chief executive has been in place for five years, there will be a seven-month handover between Mr Jones and Mr Barton and the announcement was made just before a series of investor meetings. It looks remarkably well organised and professional. Why, then, is it so hard for other companies to do the same? Companies like Wm Morrison, for instance. Energy gap There may be something of the old warhorse sensing the fray in Sir Digby Jones's warnings about the risks of power cuts facing British industry this winter. It may well be that we sail through to spring with not a power cut in sight, let alone the return of the three-day week. But if we do there will be an element of luck involved. Britain is facing a supply squeeze - how severe depends on the weather. If half the country is covered in a blanket of snow and we all stay home for days then gas won't be a problem. But if we get prolonged biting cold, with the heating turned up at home and at work, then industry will be facing cuts. Either way the fact remains that a gap has emerged between Britain's own gas supplies going into decline and the completion of the import infrastructure needed to plug that gap. OK, in a couple of years the squeeze should have disappeared. But then we may be contemplating another looming energy problem. Then it will be whether we will have enough capacity, long term, to generate electricity as existing power stations - nuclear on the grounds of age, coal on the grounds of emissions - are phased out and closed down. Building power stations takes time and money. Investors need to know the non-commercial risks - carbon taxes and targets, is nuclear an option or not? Decisions need to be taken soon. At the risk of crying wolf, Sir Digby has highlighted the risks of not planning far enough ahead. Any reminder of the long term nature of the energy business and the dangers of delay is to be welcomed. Card sharps Credit card companies have always been careful not to reveal how much money they make from slapping \u00a325-a-go penalty charges on late payers. Indeed, some of their bosses have sat before the treasury select committee of MPs and insisted - honest, guv - these fees merely cover their costs . The Office of Fair Trading, however, is convinced customers are paying too much for failing to pay up on time and has demanded the banks cut the excessive charge. Clearly, the card companies were never going to roll over to the OFT's demand and as the watchdog's deadline for hearing objections looms, they are preparing their arguments to keep the default charge as high as possible. They do appear, though, to be on a hiding to nothing. In 1998 the fee was \u00a313 and there has never been a clear explanation why the charge has almost doubled in the intervening years. Analysts at Morgan Stanley have estimated how much money might be at stake. They reckon lost fee income across the industry could be up to \u00a3400m, with most of the pain falling on Barclaycard because it has a market share of 20%. The analysts wonder if the banks will raise rates to defend their profits if default charges are drastically scaled back. It is, clearly, a good question and one the OFT might want to consider too. Barclaycard has already raised its APR by 2%, though - obviously - this is entirely unconnected to the OFT's plans."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
