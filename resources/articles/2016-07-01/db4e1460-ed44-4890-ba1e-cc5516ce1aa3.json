That\u2019s why I know we are not going to get carried away. We are not thinking of the final, much less thinking about winning the tournament. We are just thinking about the next challenge, which is Portugal.\u201d The only downside of a famous night were the cautions for Aaron Ramsey and Ben Davies that rule them out of the semi-final in Lyon on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m gutted for them both and Aaron in my opinion has been one of the best players in the tournament,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cI think being suspended for two yellows in five games is a bit tough but the rules are the rules. We had to do what we needed to do to get through against Belgium. Aaron and Ben both took one for the team. They are big losses for us but they can be very proud of their contributions. We wouldn\u2019t be where we are without them.\u201d Wales\u2019s win was all the more impressive after coming back from a goal down, surviving an opening 20 minutes when Belgium looked as if they might play them off the pitch. \u201cWhen you are facing a team as good as Belgium the last thing you want to do is go a goal down after 10 or 15 minutes,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cBut after our worst fears were confirmed we just got on with the game plan. Once we equalised we bossed the first half and not many teams will do that against Belgium. There were long periods when we were in control. We didn\u2019t nick this result, we took the game to Belgium. We kept going forward and when we had to defend we defended like soldiers.\u201d The Wales supporters were singing \u201cAre you watching, England?\u201d at the end, and their side\u2019s success seems to give the lie to the theory that the demanding Premier League season takes a toll on British teams in tournaments. \u201cIt is a long hard season, and I am still in favour of a winter break,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cI saw how beneficial it was during my time in Spain. But to be honest we haven\u2019t talked about being tired because we are all so excited to be here.\u201d Marc Wilmots accepted his side had been well beaten. \u201cWe weren\u2019t good enough, it\u2019s very simple,\u201d the Belgium manager said. \u201cWales played a better game, they had a better mentality. We made a great start and we had chances to kill the game off but we weren\u2019t effective enough. Wales have a good team with well-known players like Ramsey, Bale and Robson-Kanu and ultimately they were stronger. We knew it wasn\u2019t going to be easy. This is a missed opportunity for us but we can\u2019t play the match again. It\u2019s over. All we can do is look forward to the next qualifying campaign.\u201d Wilmots, who will consider his position once the tournament has finished, pointed out he had to replace two of his regular defenders and felt his side\u2019s inexperience had cost them. \u201cWe played an excellent match for the first 20 minutes, then out of nowhere we dropped 15 metres deeper,\u201d he said. \u201cI kept shouting push out, I can\u2019t really explain why we kept dropping off, but we made other mistakes that we shouldn\u2019t have done. \u201cI think fear might have been a factor in the end. We had a very young team on the pitch, especially in defence.\u201d Hal Robson-Kanu, voted the man of the match after scoring a delightful second goal, said Wales\u2019s success was fully deserved but hard to take in. \u201cWe\u2019re on cloud nine, we\u2019ve been working for years for a night like this,\u201d the striker out of contract at Reading said. \u201cWe appreciate all the support and we are just so glad to have done the nation proud. We came into this tournament as underdogs, to get through to the quarters was a fantastic achievement but a performance like that to put us in the last four is a credit to everyone involved, the players and the staff. I don\u2019t know how much celebrating we will be able to do, we are professionals and we have another game coming up, but we\u2019ll certainly enjoy ourselves.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
