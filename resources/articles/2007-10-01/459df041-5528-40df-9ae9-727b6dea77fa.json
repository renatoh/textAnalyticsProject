Mr Gore and the UN's intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) will split the $1.5m (\u00a3750,000) prize. They were chosen from a field of 181 candidates. The Norwegian committee praised Mr Gore, who lost the 2000 presidential election to George Bush, for his strong commitment to the struggle against climate change. \"He is probably the single individual who has done most to create greater worldwide understanding of the measures that need to be adopted,\" the committee said. However, Mr Gore's award-winning film on the issue, An Inconvenient Truth, was this week criticised in a British high court case for allegedly containing inaccuracies.
