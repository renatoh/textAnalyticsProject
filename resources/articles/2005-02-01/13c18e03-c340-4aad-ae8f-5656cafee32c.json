First, the fixture list is filled to bursting point, and second, the Premier League's influence is unmatched. In agreeing to Sven-Goran Eriksson's request for a four-week break to prepare his players for the 2006 World Cup finals the FA board made a commendable, common-sense decision. At the last two major tournaments England's quarter-final failures have been those of a tired team. With all England's major European rivals guaranteed a four-week break thanks to Fifa's ruling that all domestic fixtures must conclude by May 13, Eriksson was justified in calling in a favour. Key figures in the FA are also keen to ensure that he has every chance of succeeding. What Eriksson may not have known when he asked for the dispensation is that the FA had already asked for - and received - permission from Fifa for the Cup final to be played on May 20. Shifting the match forward a week to May 13, the scheduled conclusion of the Premier League, is easier said than done. To do so without affecting either the format or tradition of the FA Cup requires Premier League assistance and, despite the presence of four Premier League chairmen on the FA board that made the decision, that will not be forthcoming. The FA's chief executive Brian Barwick met Richard Scudamore, his opposite number at the Premier League, and the Football League chairman Brian Mawhinney for the first time yesterday, and both assured him they would cooperate fully to try to find a solution. The reality is that for all the kind words Barwick is on his own. A combination of broadcast contracts and a feeling that it is being asked to accommodate another shambles created in Soho Square mean the Premier League is neither able nor willing to compromise, and an alteration to the FA Cup seems the only option. There is no chance of the Premiership kicking off a week early, not least because the Football League is reluctant to have its opening day overshadowed. The Premiership will also not countenance shifting a round of weekend fixtures to a midweek slot vacated by the cancellation of an England friendly, because it is contractually committed to 32 weekend rounds. That leaves the FA with two options. The first is to cancel fifth-round replays, then play the quarter-finals in the midweek slot reserved for them, freeing a weekend in February for Premiership fixtures. The second is to move the Cup final to May 10, potentially the opening game at the new Wembley. Neither option will provide the chief-executive with much succour as he reflects on his first week in the job. The Arsenal manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger yesterday joined supporters' groups in expressing disapproval at the idea of a midweek final. He has taken his club to four FA Cup finals since his arrival at Highbury in 1996 and won three of them. He enjoys the traditional weekend showpiece. \"I would feel sorry to play it on a Wednesday night because it's a special weekend for people,\" he said. \"You never forget the colours of a real cup game on a Saturday or Sunday afernoon - I don't mind [which].\" Supporters predictably opposed the idea. Some 86% of fans feel it is important that the game continues to be held on Saturday, according to a survey conducted by the Football Fans Census yesterday. The survey of more than 750 football fans also found that 79% of supporters feel that staging the game on a Wednesday would decrease the stature of the FA Cup. It also said 68% of the fans surveyed said that a Saturday FA Cup final was more important than England having an extra week to prepare for the World Cup, whereas 25% felt the opposite."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
