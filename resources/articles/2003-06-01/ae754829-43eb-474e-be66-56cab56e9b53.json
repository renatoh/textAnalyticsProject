In the changing rooms the players were saying they couldn't have given any more, and what the players need now is rest - a summer of internationals is not the best way to prepare for the World Cup,\" he said. How much Clive Woodward can expect of the tired bodies of Martin Johnson, Neil Back and Graham Rowntree in New Zealand and Australia this month is anyone's guess. Certainly the three veteran England forwards might think playing the All Blacks next week is a gentle warm-down after this draining 100 minutes in 30C (86F) temperatures. The novel experience of watching rugby through sun-glasses may catch on if this game is anything to go by. It was a sun-drenched Saturday lunchtime drama at the home of Leicester's fiercest rivals, Northampton, and the Tigers, having watched Toulouse walk off with their title the previous week, avoided exclusion from next year's Heineken Cup. But Richards remained unenthused about having to play off against a side who finished 13 points below them in the Premiership for the right to the final Heineken Cup spot. \"I still think it is unfair to Gloucester to have to play off for the title and for ourselves to appear here. But as a climax to the end of the season it has something going for it and 8,000 people out there had some great entertainment.\" Back secured the victory 15 minutes into extra-time after the teams were locked together at 20-20 after 80 minutes. The flanker found a hole in a tiring defence after Freddie Tuilagi had made ground into the Saracens 22 from a scrum. It was unbearably cruel on Saracens, who had fought back twice at the end of normal time. In the final minute a stunning counterattack by Saracens was finished off with a try by Richard Haughton, their player of the season, from a brilliant cut-out pass from the substitute Thomas Castaign\u00e8de. That brought the scores level at 17-17, and although Saracens fell three points behind three minutes into injury-time when Richard Hill was penalised for supposedly holding on to Ben Kay after tackling the lock in front of the posts, Tim Stimpson's penalty was immediately wiped out when Kay obstructed at the restart and Andy Goode, a Leicester old boy, landed his second penalty. But after Back's extra-time try there was no way back. There may too be no way back for Saracens' coach Wayne Shelford at the end of an unhappy season. A board meeting this month will settle his fate but the club's chief executive Mark Sinderberry is expected to recommend replacing the New Zealander. Sinderberry has already recruited the former ACT centre Rod Kafer, who is giving up his player-coach role at Leicester, and the club chairman Nigel Wray has grown frustrated at the lack of silverware in the past five years. Saracens are also losing the core of their team. Along with the retiring Abdel Benazzi and Tim Horan, the forwards Matt Cairns, David Flatman and Stuart Hooper are leaving and Christian Califano returns to France, after one mediocre season, with hardly a backward glance. Saracens supporters who created a real carnival atmosphere here deserve more.
