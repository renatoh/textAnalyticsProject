The government paper, The Herald, rails against the action but the independent paper, The Daily News, reports that the EU had finally taken action in the face of provocation from the Mugabe government. 8am: Checking my e-mail I see the Mugabe government has made decisions about which foreign journalists will be able to cover the upcoming presidential election, set for March 9 and 10. Correspondents from British newspapers have been rejected. So has the BBC. The information minister, Jonathan Moyo, will make an exception to allow a television crew from ITN into Zimbabwe - just to spite the BBC. Swedish, Dutch and German journalists are also barred. Most of the foreign press corps in Johannesburg have been rejected, although correspondents from the New York Times, CNN and National Public Radio have been given permission to come. Clearly Mr Moyo is picking and choosing those whom he thinks he will be able to influence. 10am: I call the government official dealing with press accreditation to find out my status. I am told The Guardian is \"not an approved paper\". I respond that I am nevertheless fully accredited here in Zimbabwe and therefore should be able to cover the election. \"Yes, that is the problem,\" says the official. He says he will discuss the situation with his superiors and I can phone later for the decision. Special accreditation for the presidential election is not absolutely necessary. The main thing it does is give a journalist permission to attend government press conferences, particularly to the announcement of the voting results. As those results are also broadcast live on state television, it is relatively easy to get by without the accreditation. But in the current climate of threats and insecurity in Zimbabwe, it is good to have all the appropriate accreditation and press cards. To operate without one might lead to a situation where the government brands one a rogue journalist. That could easily lead to an unpleasant, if not downright threatening, situation. 1pm: Lunch with an official for an international aid organisation. He tells me surveys show the vote could go as high as 70% against Mugabe if the elections were free and fair. But he says the government is working hard to reduce that margin through rigging. 3pm: Write story for The Guardian about the local reactions to sanctions. Speak to Zimbabwean friends, who are pleased that cabinet ministers will have to take their children out of posh British schools and universities. \"Let them experience the horrible conditions in Zimbabwe's schools,\" she tells me. 5pm: Phone government official to find out my accreditation status. I am told to go to the accreditation centre on Monday, February 25, with appropriate letters and $300 in cash. It sounds like I am going to get the accreditation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
