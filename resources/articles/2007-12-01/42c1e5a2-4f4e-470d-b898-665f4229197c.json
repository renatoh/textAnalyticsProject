Snow is expected in the Pennines and in Scotland, while high winds are also forecast for Wales and the Midlands, writes Robin McKie. However, the south-west of England will bear the brunt of the storms, with winds reaching speeds of up to 80mph. A total of 22 flood warnings have been issued for the region, with three in the Midlands and five in Wales. 'Very strong winds will come across Devon and Cornwall,' said Marco Petagna, forecaster for MeteoGroup. He added that the heaviest winds were expected in the morning, before the weather calmed in the afternoon or early evening. 'The south coast could also experience winds of 50mph to 55mph.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
