Woods announced on Friday that he would not play at Bay Hill this week in the Arnold Palmer Invitational as he attempts to recover the fitness and form he deems sufficient for a comeback to the PGA Tour. However, the four\u2011times Masters champion said he is hopeful of returning from his indefinite hiatus at Augusta. The Masters is the only major that McIlroy has yet to win following a remarkably successful 2014 that provided the Northern Irishman with stunning victories at Hoylake and Valhalla to secure the Open Championship and US PGA Championship respectively. Those titles came before a European triumph in the Ryder Cup under the stewardship of McGinley, who believes Woods\u2019 presence at Augusta would mean McIlroy could escape a degree of the limelight and increase the 25-year\u2011old\u2019s focus on a career grand slam. Asked if it would be easier for McIlroy should Woods return, McGinley said: \u201cOf course. Look what happens at the US PGA last year, all the talk is Tiger going to play, is he not going to play? At the time Rory was favourite but all the expectation, all the talk, all you guys were focused on Tiger. \u201cRory didn\u2019t sneak in the backdoor, but he was able to go about his business without the attention on him. I do hope Tiger comes back, we all hope Tiger comes back. I don\u2019t know if he will or not, we\u2019ll have to wait and see.\u201d On McIlroy\u2019s development McGinley \u2013 who will be at the Masters in Augusta commentating for Sky Sports, the only place to watch all four days live \u2013 added: \u201cAs a human being talking to him, it\u2019s incredible how much he gets it, how mature he is for such a young guy. But he\u2019s had a lot of life experiences. \u201cTo a large extent when he turned professional on the back of a successful amateur career, if you look compared to say me, Darren [Clarke] and Padraig [Harrington] when we turned professional, he was way more down the line than we were. Not just as a golfer, although arguably against Darren he might not have been as far down the line \u2013 him and Darren were very similar in terms of quality of amateur careers.\u201d Woods spoke with Palmer on Friday to confirm that he would not play at his tournament, having also been absent from Bay Hill last year before back surgery which led to him missing the Masters. In February, Woods said \u201cmy play, and scores, are not acceptable for tournament golf\u201d following an alarming run of form, yet he released a statement on his website last week that read: \u201cI\u2019ve put in a lot of time and work on my game and I\u2019m making strides, but like I\u2019ve said, I won\u2019t return to the PGA Tour until my game is tournament ready and I can compete at the highest level. I hope to be ready for the Masters, and I will continue to work hard preparing for Augusta\u201d. Of Woods\u2019s drastic decline, McGinley said: \u201cOf course I\u2019ve been shocked, who hasn\u2019t been shocked? When you see a guy who was as great with the chipping as Tiger was, is he going to come back from it? We really don\u2019t know. All you can say about Tiger is, he\u2019s nearly 40 years of age. The intensity Tiger has given to the game for 20 years he\u2019s been a pro, that intensity does have an effect on you. Is there a little bit of burnout going on? \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why guys don\u2019t play their best golf in their 40s and late 30s. We\u2019ll wait and see, I certainly hope there\u2019s more to come from Tiger. We all do, for me he\u2019s been great for the game of golf. My hunch would be there\u2019s something bigger going on. But my point is, we talk about Rory and he is in the evolution towards his best golf. There\u2019s no doubt Tiger has peaked in age times, and in terms of when guys normally play their best golf. That doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s finished, but certainly he\u2019s in the back nine of his career.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
