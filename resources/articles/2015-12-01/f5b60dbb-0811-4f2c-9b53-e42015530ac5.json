Yet the whiff around the sport is about to become more pungent. Over the next few weeks, senior figures are expected to receive life bans from track and field. Some may face prison. And the levels of the cosy corruption at the IAAF, which enabled some officials to demand money from the Russian marathon runner Liliya Shobukhova in order to cover up anomalies in her blood passport, will be blasted out in surround sound. All of which presents a fiendish problem for Seb Coe \u2013 but also, potentially, an opportunity. The music will start playing on Wednesday, when the International Association of Athletics Federations\u2019 ethics commission begins a three-day disciplinary hearing under Michael Beloff QC into those officials who extorted cash from Shobukhova. It will become louder still when, in an announcement scheduled for 14 January in Munich, Dick Pound releases the second part of his report, which will skewer the IAAF in the same vigorous way that Russian athletics was. If that is not serious enough, there is the looming denouement of the French police\u2019s criminal investigation into several IAAF figures \u2013 including the former president Lamine Diack, who is alleged to have pocketed \u20ac1m in bribes. How Lord Coe reacts when these events play out could determine how his presidency is viewed. Since taking charge of the IAAF he has positioned himself as the athletics equivalent of Mikhail Gorbachev, who went from insider to reformer by promoting perestroika (restructuring) and glasnost (openness). We have heard a lot from Coe about restructuring but rather less about openness, and his failure to criticise the sport\u2019s old guard deeply troubles some. As Toni Minichiello, the widely respected coach of the world champion heptathlete, Jessica Ennis-Hill, puts it: \u201cThere is still a layer of arrogance that does the IAAF no favours. And it is worrying that Coe has so far showed more outrage about journalists discovering athletes\u2019 blood values than the alleged corruption of senior IAAF people.\u201d That may be because Coe has been told by the French police not to comment on those under investigation. Critics, however, fear that when it comes to sniffing out wrongdoing, he too often has a blocked-up nose. Despite the reports from Beloff and Pound, which will again put athletics\u2019 problems on the front pages, Coe seems reluctant to concede how serious the situation is. Last week on the Today programme he was asked whether the IAAF\u2019s problems are as big as Fifa\u2019s. He demurred, saying it involved only a handful of officials \u2013 but that was a nifty sidestep. In terms of people and the sums involved it is smaller but some of those under investigation \u2013 including Gabriel Doll\u00e9, the IAAF\u2019s former head of anti-doping, Valentin Balakhnichev, the former president of the Russia Athletic Federation and IAAF treasurer, and Diack himself \u2013 are not only accused of taking bribes but also of influencing events on the field of play by allowing Shobukhova to compete when they knew she was cheating. For all their faults, no one has accused Sepp Blatter or Michel Platini of doing something similar. During that interview, Coe also trumpeted that fact that he is doubling athletics\u2019 anti-doping budget. Minichiello, however, believes that it is still not enough. \u201cMy major concern is that catching dopers is still too often seen as an embarrassment for athletics rather than a victory,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think the IAAF is doing enough to protect clean athletes. In fact, I\u2019d give them an E for effort because they should be testing far more regularly, including blood and urine, and using the best methods such as carbon isotape ratio tests, to stop cheats.\u201d While these are troubling times, the PR expert Mark Borkowski believes Coe is smart enough to turn the organisation round. \u201cHe is in a middle of a cyclone and he will feel lonely,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t write any obituaries. If he can change world athletics, we\u2019ll be looking at him in a different way in a couple of years\u2019 time.\u201d Borkowski believes Coe must untangle himself from Diack, admit he misjudged the mood with his Nike deal and get on the front foot. It is sound advice but as long as Coe regards the likes of the ARD journalist Hajo Seppelt and the BBC\u2019s Mark Daly as irritants not truth-seekers, some will be reluctant to grant him the benefit of the doubt. Let me give a small example. A fortnight ago the IAAF appointed six people to its Athletes\u2019 commission \u2013 Paula Radcliffe, Ashton Eaton, Ezekiel Kemboi, Alina Talay, Fabiana Murer and Michael Frater. The common thread they share, apart from being tremendously talented? They all either are \u2013 or were \u2013 sponsored by Nike. Coincidence? Probably \u2013 but some in the sport suspected it was deliberate. One day, this period in the IAAF\u2019s history will make a case study in public-relations textbooks. While Coe\u2019s task is far from easy, it is surprising that someone who was a PR professional has not given a sharper message during this crisis. Doubly so, given his friends insist there is an alternative narrative, which goes something like this: it was Coe who went to Diack last December to demand he had to suspend his son and the other IAAF officials after stories broke about the Shobukhova case. It was Coe who had suspicions about some IAAF colleagues but realised he had to take power to really change his sport. And it is Coe who despite his flaws is still the best person to turn athletics round. The question is, will enough people still be open-minded enough to hear it?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
