Lily Allen, daughter of professional geezer Keith, grows up largely without him, dividing her childhood between council flats and film premieres, where she says times were hard for her single mum \"what with three kids' school fees to pay\". She gets expelled frequently, guzzles a load of club drugs in Ibiza, writes some brilliant songs about London life and becomes the queen of MySpace, where she blogs her heart away about how rubbish everyone else is. The diminutive brunette then turns 21 and her debut single, Smile, plunges straight into the charts at No 1. The good news is that her first hit is by no means her greatest effort. Entering the landscape of Alright, Still is a bit like watching Sex and the City as re-enacted by Marmalade Atkins, with various cameos from the Bash Street Kids. That's not to say that anybody but Allen stars on this album, although there are various producers and co-writers behind the scenes, including New York's coolest hip-hop helper, Mark Ronson. Rather, the guests are a roll call of ex-boyfriends, nightclub door whores, and City sleazebags, of whom she makes verbal mincemeat. Allen is not so much hanging out her dirty laundry as rolling around in it, delighting in its filth, to a soundtrack of ska rhythms and lilting reggae tones. Knock Em Out deals with how to get rid of sleazy blokes, though somebody seems to have had a word with Lily about propriety: the album version includes the \"I'm pregnant, I've got syphilis\" lines but fades out just before her \"I've got Aids\" comedy bombshell. Everything's Just Wonderful, a bittersweet and honest tale of mixed-up modern life, scores the coup of rhyming weight loss with Kate Moss, while Littlest Things is a perfect description of missing someone: \"We'd spend the whole weekend lying in our own dirt/ I was just so happy in your boxers and your T-shirt.\" (Her album is also missing someone - the hilarious Nan You're a Window Shopper couldn't be included owing to sample clearance issues.) Sure there are flaws - some of the rhymes trail off, while Allen's singing voice can descend into little-girl-lost territory and lose its impact. Her love of the Happy Mondays has clearly influenced Take What You Take: unfortunately, it's the whinier side to their sound that comes through. But overall, if the album is rough round the edges, that amateurism serves to bring the listener in; makes you feel like you're in a conversation with your best mate. The female Mike Skinner? She's far, far better than that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
