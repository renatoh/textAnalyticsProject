The 28-year-old striker had just been released by West Bromwich Albion after what can politely be put as an unproductive, non\u2011scoring season under Tony Pulis and Premier League clubs were not exactly queuing up for his services. Convinced of his own ability, the powerfully built 6ft 3in former Everton forward hired a personal trainer in LA, working out three times a day with the celebrity fitness guru Nicky Holender. \u201cWe didn\u2019t train at Muscle beach, though,\u201d he said. \u201cJust football places.\u201d In between sessions he watched with interest as David Moyes, his former manager at Goodison Park, succeeded Sam Allardyce at Sunderland and then struggled to sign a striker to complement and/or understudy Jermain Defoe. When one did not materialise Moyes picked up the phone and in September Anichebe was installed on Wearside. Fast forward a slow-burn couple of months and he has confounded his critics by scoring three goals in two games, the latter pair at home against Hull City on Saturday in a 3-0 victory that finally lifted Sunderland off the bottom of the Premier League and simultaneously pushed Mike Phelan\u2019s side back into deep trouble. \u201cVictor was like a young Didier Drogba,\u201d Moyes said. \u201cHe was immense.\u201d The admiration is mutual. \u201cEveryone knows I\u2019ve got this love for David,\u201d Anichebe said. \u201cI had a lot of bigger money offers from abroad but I always wanted to come back and play for this manager.\u201d Aware Moyes was sceptical about his physical condition, Anichebe emailed him videos of those workouts. Yet having convinced the Scot to offer him another chance, initial progress was slow. \u201cI felt great but it wasn\u2019t match fitness,\u201d says a man who struggled so hard to score in one early training session that everyone \u2013 team-mates, coaching and medical staff \u2013 broke into relieved applause when he finally managed to hit the back of the net. Anichebe, who has scored in successive league games for the first time since 2012, has never been prolific but he proved integral to Sunderland\u2019s first win of the season at Bournemouth two weeks ago and emphasised his importance against a Hull defence who, at times, found him unplayable. When action recommenced following a dusky 10-minute second-half hiatus caused by a power cut and the need to connect the floodlights to a generator, Anichebe truly stepped out of the shadows. His first goal came when he dodged Josh Tymon and beat David Marshall at the near post; the second from a Defoe pass when his first touch took him away from a defender before he lashed home a thunderous shot. Indeed Moyes\u2019s bravery in pairing Defoe \u2013 who opened the scoring with his 150th Premier League goal \u2013 and Anichebe in a flexible 4-4-2 formation threatens to destabilise the best centre-halves. \u201cI always wanted to play with Jermain and I also wanted to taste what it\u2019s like to play in the north-east,\u201d said a forward with scope to drift deeper and left when needed. \u201cI\u2019d heard how passionate the fans are and that sort of support really drives you on. At times against Hull we were dead on our feet but the crowd pushed us on. Subconsciously, it really helps. And this club has great facilities, there\u2019s no comparison with West Brom, the facilities here are different class.\u201d Indeed he seems rather indifferent towards life at The Hawthorns. \u201cI wasn\u2019t being played much but I wasn\u2019t bothered because it gave me time to concentrate on my body. On getting stronger. I tried to turn a bad time into a good time \u2013 and I always remembered the belief David Moyes has in me.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
