All I wanted when I ran a bookshop was someone who could answer the two trick questions: (1) Which of the books you read recently could you get most enthusiastic about to customers? This weeded out the people who looked caught in the headlights at the idea of actually reading a book. (2) If a middle-aged foreign tourist asks for a recommendation, what do you say? To which the answer is not \u201cI\u2019d recommend something typically British,\u201d but \u201cI can\u2019t recommend anything unless I find out what sort of books she actually likes.\u201d Testing the questions on my current employees, I found they passed with flying colours. I wanted more of the same.
