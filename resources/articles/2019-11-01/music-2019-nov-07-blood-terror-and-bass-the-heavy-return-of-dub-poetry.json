With his 1978 album Dread Beat an\u2019 Blood, which fiercely criticised police brutality in London and forecast the 1981 Brixton riots, Johnson helped to establish dub poetry: a blend of chest-rattling bass and thunderous verses speaking truth to power. He gave Robinson a memorable, if cryptic, missive. \u201cHe said, \u2018Nobody needs to sound like me now,\u2019\u201d recalls Robinson, who records and performs with Kevin Martin (AKA deep bass explorer the Bug) as King Midas Sound. \u201cThat made me think, what would dub poetry be now? He\u2019s a very progressive thinker and he would want to see it morph into something that has the same sentiment, but a different framework and emphasis.\u201d He may have found the answer. King Midas Sound\u2019s stark, resonant new album Solitude arrived last spring, along with a wave of underground artists such as Amet, Asda and the duo of Jay Glass Dubs and Leslie Winer, who are revitalising dub poetry for a new era of political tumult and social injustice. Like their predecessors, who emerged from reggae\u2019s soundsystem culture, this next generation of dub poets is by no means aesthetically similar. Even the term itself, coined by Jamaican dub poet Oku Onuora, has been controversial, with luminaries such as Johnson and Mutabaruka identifying as simply \u201cpoets\u201d to distance themselves from it \u2013 but their ideologies are unquestionably shared. \u201cIt\u2019s about equality and justice,\u201d explains Lillian Allen, Toronto dub poet and professor. \u201cCalling the system to account and validating people\u2019s inner voices and experiences, and giving voice to all kinds of things that are unknown, unseen and unspoken, and recalibrating the knowledge to provide a new perspective.\u201d Last year, the Last Poets \u2013 the godfathers of hip-hop \u2013 excoriated the US administration on their album Understand What Black Is. Founding member Abiodun Oyewole set their lyrics to reggae because it\u2019s \u201crebellious music that speaks volumes, and doesn\u2019t abide with the systems that exist, governmental systems and so forth\u201d. Indeed, when Oyewole booms \u201cAmerica is a terrorist!\u201d on Rain of Terror, his transmission comes through loud and clear, whether framed by spectral skanking or, on the dub version, syrupy reverb. Another dub poetry champion is Camae Ayewa, AKA Moor Mother, a poet, musician and activist who runs youth workshops in her north Philadelphia community. \u201cI\u2019m a reactionary artist, in the sense that I\u2019m stuck in what\u2019s happening now,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s the beautiful part of dub poetry: saying your perspective and everyone\u2019s perspective in the moment.\u201d In 2016, Moor Mother released the formidable Fetish Bones, a eulogy for black people killed by police officers and a condemnation of the festering politics that gave the US President Trump. On its follow-up, Analog Fluids of Sonic Black Holes, Moor Mother performs her signature \u201cDIY time travel\u201d to explore black histories, from slave narratives to the Rodney King beating, with hypnotic intonations, granular samples and churning digital noise. She also recently collaborated with the London Contemporary Orchestra on The Great Bailout, a free-verse poem that interrogates slavery, colonialism and commerce, and which helped the UK develop into a stronghold of dub poetry and other music of the Caribbean diaspora. Though her art is rooted in punk and hip-hop and draws from myriad sources \u2013 free jazz, Black Arts poet Sonia Sanchez, Rage Against the Machine \u2013 it fits under dub poetry\u2019s increasingly expansive sonic parameters. Ayewa speaks of her art and activism in the same breath but eschews \u201cprotest music,\u201d a label that Robinson and Martin embrace on Solitude, where Robinson\u2019s hollow declarations of lost love bottom out in a post-apocalyptic soundscape of formless low-end and high-pitched whines. Through the bleakness of Martin\u2019s production and Robinson\u2019s character, the personal becomes political, and ties Solitude to dub poetry\u2019s commentary on society. \u201cDub poetry is a form of protest art,\u201d says Martin. \u201cIt felt like there was an air of desolation in the record that\u2019s appropriate for where we are now in history, and in the world, which seems more turbulent than ever. There\u2019s this precipice of chaos leading to God knows where.\u201d Ayewa has also teamed up with Martin and Justin K Broadrick as Zonal. Though Broadrick\u2019s background as singer with the industrial metal titans Godflesh and his solo mutant shoegaze project Jesu might make him an odd choice for a dub poetry collaboration, he can bring Ayewa\u2019s philosophical dispatches to unsuspecting audiences who could benefit from it the most. \u201cI\u2019ve met many people over the years who said that Godflesh not only opened the doors for them musically, but socially and politically as well,\u201d he says. \u201cI hope that people are listening.\u201d On Zonal\u2019s standout track In a Cage, Moor Mother echoes the nihilism and futility that underpins Solitude as she riffs on the Smashing Pumpkins: \u201cDespite all my rage/ We still in a daze.\u201d Dub poetry\u2019s brilliance is to bring that dazed world into a little more focus."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
