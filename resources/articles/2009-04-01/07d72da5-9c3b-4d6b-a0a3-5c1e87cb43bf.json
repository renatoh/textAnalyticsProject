His mother worked as a theatrical makeup artist and now runs her own makeup school, and his father was an actor trapped in an ad man's body. \"Both of them,\" says Cruttenden, \"did a lot of amateur theatre.\" Following an early nomination for best newcomer at the Edinburgh festival in 2002, it's fair to say that Cruttenden has been up-and-coming for the best part of a decade. That doesn't mean he's been lazy or is struggling to establish a following on the circuit, he claims. \"I'm not really sell-able,\" he says. \"I've never been cool. I've just been building steadily.\" Which is precisely why, comedy fans, Hal Cruttenden is so very appealing. Unashamedly middle-class, hitting middle-age, a little bit rotund, a fair bit daft; he's the antidote to the laddish swagger and sardonic cool of those other rising stars. Like a soft-hearted tortoise in a race against sleek hares, Cruttenden's routine employs adroit, inventive riffs on life in Enfield. The north-eastern fringes of London might not seem the most obvious place for The Next Big Thing in Face-Hurting Funny, but stories about neighbours playing top trumps with patio furniture and what it's like to be beaten up by your kids see him at his most natural. \"I really wanted to be a hard-hitting comic,\" he tells us. \"But I couldn't be bothered to do all the reading.\" The gag: \"Public humiliation won't bring me down,\" says Cruttenden, and when you're aiming to make people laugh, setting yourself up as the target isn't a bad start. As one TV type put it to him: \"You'll probably have to wait for Michael McIntyre to die before you really hit the big time.\" Strange but true: Cruttenden got his comedy break writing traffic reports for the BBC. Most likely to: Get in the jokes about his \"tubby\" silhouette before the hecklers can. Least likely to: Shag for Britain in an attempt to become the next Russell Brand. The hype: \"He takes the personal, the surreal, the ridiculous and the political, and whizzes them into a delicious comedy smoothie that's sweet with a hint of sharpness. And it's really good for you\" (The Scotsman); \"An hour of comedy that can't fail to delight\" (Metro). The truth: He is, he says, \"developing into Mr Angry Suburban, with an edge of a midlife crisis coming along\". It might not be wholly original, but done with high camp and nattily constructed punchlines, it definitely holds charm. File next to: Michael McIntyre, Ray Romano. Now watch this: Hal Cruttenden on fitness."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
