The warning by the Bechtel and Amey-owned Tube Lines to the contractor Alstom came as a row blew up over disruption in recent days on the Northern line. This followed four safety alerts over the last month which led unions to demand extra measures and London Underground to slap an \"emergency direction\" on Tube Lines. London Underground has sent in inspectors and effectively taken safety maintenance in-house until train brake problems have been rectified. Terry Morgan, chief executive of Tube Lines, insisted that before London Underground's move the consortium had sent up to 40 engineers in to oversee work being done by its contractor, Alstom. That company provides new trains and maintains them under a 20-year PFI contract which Tube Lines inherited when it won the 30-year public private partnership with London Underground. \"Everyone acknowledges we have achieved terrific improvements in service levels on the Piccadilly and Jubilee lines but it has not got better on the Northern line,\" Mr Morgan said. \"We are now having discussions about how we can change the [Northern Line] maintenance contract and lease arrangements to make them more consistent.\" Alstom argued last night that it was being unfairly blamed. \"Obviously we regret any inconvenience caused to our customers and the travelling public but we feel much of the criticism and subsequent actions are unjustified,\" said Alstom Transport's managing director in the UK, Eric Prescott. \"We do not agree with the audit and feel it is over-reaction on the part of Tube Lines and London Underground ... We object to the inferences of gross incompetence and wilful neglect.\" The emergency notice forced Tube Lines to inspect all its trains and only half of the 100-strong fleet was available for work at the end of last week. Even yesterday the Northern line, which carries more than 700,000 passengers a day, was not working normally."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
