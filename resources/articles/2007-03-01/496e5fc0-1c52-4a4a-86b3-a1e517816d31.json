Courier: (Removing his helmet) \"Do you have any mail for us?\" Receptionist \"No dear.\" Then suddenly looking up and noting the colour of his skin. \"Actually, yes - I have seen something. Er... it's for a Mr Akuja. Would that be you dear?\" Courier: \"It's from Akuja, and yes, that's it.\" Receptionist: (handing over the package) What part of the world are you originally from, dear?\" Courier: \"Nigeria.\" Receptionist: (excited) \"Did you seen that programme on TV last night - The Last Slave? It was very good.\" Courier: (unmoved) \"I don't have a TV.\" Receptionist: (undeterred) \"Don't you dear? It was very interesting. Did you know it wasn't just the white men who trafficked in slaves?\" Courier: \"I don't watch TV, I only listen to the radio.\" Receptionist: (pointing at TV screen, where they were talking about senator Barack Obama) \"Then you must have heard about him. Did you know that his great-great-grandfather had 50 slaves or something?\" Courier: (leaving) \"I've gotta go.\" Receptionist: (calling after him) \"It's shocking though, isn't it?\" As he strode purposefully past I hoped that the sheer force of my own self-consciousness might somehow make me invisible."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
