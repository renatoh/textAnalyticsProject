Two Snowy Monaro regional council employees found the fossilised jaw of a baby diprotodon last Friday at an undisclosed location that is known for such paleontological findings. The council workers informed the Australian Museum of their discovery and its curator, Matthew McCurry, extracted the fossil at the weekend. \u201cA couple of locals called me up and asked me if I\u2019d like to come and collect it safely for the museum,\u201d McCurry told Guardian Australia. \u201cIf people were to try and collect these without any experience, it\u2019s quite likely that they\u2019d be broken and we\u2019d lose information.\u201d Diprotodons were a type of megafauna that were widespread across Australia and co-existed with the Indigenous population for thousands of years. The exact time of extinction is contested and estimates vary between 7,000 and 40,000 years ago. They likely fed on shrubs and herbaceous, non-grasslike plants known as forbs and may have eaten as much as 100 to 150kg of vegetation daily, using its chisel-like incisors to do so. It is the largest known marsupial to ever have lived. Their bones have been found throughout Australia but they preferred semi-arid plains, savannahs and open woodlands, according to the museum. One skeleton found at Lake Callabonna, in the far north region of South Australia, had the remains of saltbush in its abdominal region. McCurry said the creatures, which were roughly the size of a rhinoceros, were sometimes called \u201cgiant wombats\u201d, though researchers did not know how \u201cclosely they are related\u201d. \u201cAt the same time that mammoths were roaming around the northern hemisphere, Australia had its own unique set of large mammals,\u201d McCurry said. The reason for their extinction is also unknown. Researchers have suggested that humans may have played a role, either through the hunting of juveniles or through changes to their habitat caused by farming practices. The fossil is unlikely to be displayed at the museum and will instead be available to researchers from around the world to study. \u201cThe fossil record is very incomplete. Very few animals turn into fossils and when they do they are often broken up. We don\u2019t have that much information about extinct species,\u201d McCurry said. \u201cThis is a reasonably complete jaw, it\u2019s not isolated broken teeth Finding these types of fossils add to our understanding of what these animals are like.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
