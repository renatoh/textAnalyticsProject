Karl Harrison, the former Great Britain prop, has become the most expressive coach in Super League since taking over Salford in mid-season, becoming a favourite television target for an intrusive close-up. Harrison - or Rhino as he has been known since his playing days, well before Leeds pinched his nickname - has been seen seething, frowning and gesticulating as City Reds spent two months trying to get off the bottom of the table. But last Friday the cameras caught him laughing heartily as Salford won 22-2 at Warrington to climb above Wakefield - a position they retained when Trinity lost at Halifax 48 hours later. Theoretically that left Harrison in a better position than his Wakefield counterpart Adrian Vowles, because Salford's fate is in their own hands: if they beat Castleford in tomorrow's televised game at the Willows, they will be safe. But while Harrison fidgets in the stand, Vowles will have at least some control over his own destiny. The former Castleford captain is Wakefield's player-coach and lines up at loose forward against Warrington tomorrow. He too is feeling the pressure. Vowles said: \"I've been through a relegation battle before, when I first went to Castleford, but it's much worse as a coach. We have tried to be relaxed - we had a pig on a spit on Tuesday and went bowling. But it's hard not to be nervous. I'm sure Karl will be the same at Salford and, if we stay up and they go down, I'll feel sorry for him.\" Harrison has been reassured about his job even if Salford are relegated. His chairman, John Wilkinson, reiterated this week that City Reds would remain a largely full-time operation, albeit for one year only, in an attempt to bounce straight back. Vowles, like Harrison, was appointed on a two-year contract but, given Wakefield's recent history of financial upheaval, neither he nor his assistant, Shane McNally, have given much thought to their job prospects if the worst happens tomorrow. \"I want to be here whatever but I want that to be in Super League,\" said Vowles. \"We haven't asked what happens if we're not, because we don't want to look at it like that. The mood is positive and I'm pretty hopeful we will stay up.\" Vowles is confident that his old club can do him a favour at Salford since Castleford need a win to secure their place in the top six play-offs while City Reds are likely to be without Alan Hunte, their two-try match-winner at Warrington, because of a shoulder injury. For Trinity, Martin Moana will have a late fitness test on a groin problem but much will depend on the attitude of Warrington, who were so poor against Salford. In tomorrow's other games, Widnes and London Broncos will mark the end of excellent seasons with contrasting home fixtures. Widnes face Halifax, whose coach Tony Anderson insists they will go out with a bang despite a traumatic week; Broncos play St Helens, who need a win to secure first place in the final table and home advantage in the first round of the play-offs. \u00b7 Whitehaven of the Northern Ford Premiership have appointed Steve McCormack as coach. McCormack was sacked by Salford in June but has remained a member of the elite group of young British coaches."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
