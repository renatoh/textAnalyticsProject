Not a ball was bowled at Grace Road, which suited Leicestershire, who were chasing 402 against Nottinghamshire. And only 46.4 overs were possible in Chelmsford before Essex and Kent accepted the inevitable. At one juncture Kent had trailed by 25 with only six wickets intact, but Mark Ealham's first century for two years and Geraint Jones's second of the season saved them. Gloucestershire narrowly failed to cap another recovery at the Rose Bowl, where Hampshire were thankful for the erosion of nearly 40 overs. Set 283, the home side barely clung on after falling foul of Ian Harvey, who claimed four of the first five wickets. Wasim Akram and Shaun Udal drew on experience to see out the closing overs. The world's finest left-arm quick doubtless envisaged a more glamorous final chapter in his career than helping Hampshire avoid the wooden spoon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
