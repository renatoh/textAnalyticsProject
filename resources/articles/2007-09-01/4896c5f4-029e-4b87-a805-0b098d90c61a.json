In 1990, when Racing Club de Paris faced Agen in the final of the French club championships, Franck Mesnel led his back line on to the pitch wearing pink bowties. At half-time, chilled champagne was served in front of a packed Parc des Princes. Maddeningly for their opponents, these style kings managed to win as well; the hard men of Agen were put to the sword in Paris. In other games, his backs took to the field and played in blazers, berets, Bermudas and voluminous red-and-white bloomers. That blend of romance and style survives in the hearts of rugby fans who will gather in their hundreds of thousands in France over the coming weeks. On Friday, in the magnificent cauldron that is Stade de France, rugby's World Cup kicks off as Argentina take on their French hosts in a match that will define their campaigns and, possibly, the competition itself. The anthems will be spine-tingling, the atmosphere a mix of carnival and intense passion and the sport could be magical. Rugby, for so long the preserve of a scattering of former British colonies and the French, has the swaggering confidence of a sport that believes its time has come. It could, and should, be the best World Cup of all. France, the perfect venue from which to launch the sport into billions of homes in more than 190 countries, will be a seven-week party, an orgy of food and drink and good humour. Britain's police forces will not be sending plain-clothed spotters to accompany the English, Scottish and Welsh exodus and France's fearsome riot police have not been engaged in lengthy training sessions with batons and tear gas. Rugby is on the rise across the world (94 countries participated in this World Cup, compared with 16 in 1987) and the beauty of the game played by its greatest exponents makes it a contender for the best spectator sport of all. The balletic brilliance of the New Zealand All Blacks as forwards and backs flip the ball from hand to hand, switching gears and direction with incredible ease, can be breathtaking. At their peak, no one in world rugby comes close to matching that combination of sublime skill and ruthless power. Each country has its superstars, from France's Sebastian Chabal, the bearded colossus turned sex-symbol who broke England's resistance at Twickenham three weeks ago, to Ireland's Brian O'Driscoll, who rivals Roy Keane in his nation's affections, and New Zealand's Daniel Carter, the most talented fly-half of his generation. Yet the build-up in Britain and Ireland has been strangely muted, perhaps because the home nations' expectations are so limited. England leave for France as defending world champions, but with forlorn hopes of winning the Webb Ellis Cup for a second time. Wales, grand slam champions of Europe just two seasons ago, have fallen away. Scotland's ambition is just to defeat Italy and make the quarter-finals. Ireland's edge has been blunted by injury and unimaginative coaching. The television rights rest with ITV, which does not have the luxury of free air time to build anticipation or the sporting heritage to exploit it. Where the BBC or Sky would screen lengthy trailers for months, ITV has to count the pennies and sell the air space. There is none of the fevered anticipation that marks out football's, or even cricket's, world cup because, in Britain at least, rugby still struggles for acceptance. Success in Australia, when Jonny Wilkinson's drop goal won the cup in those dramatic final moments, turned England's head for a while, but the momentum was lost as the team stumbled through the next four years, losing matches and shedding coaches while Wilkinson, the clean-cut hero, was sidelined by injuries. Rugby's image remains blighted by its association with the middle classes, with the rigid stereotype of the public-school boy still trotted out by its detractors. Football, they want to believe, is the working-class game embraced by all, an image burnished by legions of football writers married as much to their dismal politics as to their sport. In France, New Zealand, Wales and parts of Ireland, rugby has mass appeal and no class barriers. In Tonga, Samoa and Fiji, it is part of life. Yet even England's victory could not eradicate an impression of privilege. The rest of the world, though, is ready for conversion. The All Blacks come, as they have come to all world cups, wearing the mantle of favourites, which they have failed to live up to since they won the 1987 competition in their own country. Since then, they have fallen to Australia, France and South Africa and this time, too, the near-invincibility of the past two years has been replaced by a hint of fallibility. For England, the immediate concern is not the victory, but the injury count. If Ireland is in the inevitable group of death alongside France and Argentina, then England's is the group of attrition. Samoa and Tonga will pound at their more illustrious opponents and it will not be pretty. Michael Jones, Samoa's coach and a former All Black, says that he has targeted South Africa and you can be certain that he does not mean that he has identified a weakness that sparkling back play can exploit. And therein lies rugby's problem: it has a violent dark side which, uncontrolled and unpunished, strips it of its romance and makes a mockery of the good humour on the terraces. The All Blacks are never more than a moment away from common assault, callously demonstrated by the spear tackle on O'Driscoll, the Lions captain, in the opening minutes of the first test in 2005, which ended his tour and could have ended his career. It went unpunished. Two weeks ago, he was targeted again, a punch almost ending his tournament before it had started. Last weekend, South Africa's victory over Scotland was marred by violence and cynicism, with South Africa's Schalk Burger again demonstrating the art of the illegal, extremely dangerous, stiff-arm tackle. These acts are deliberate, designed to hurt, to incapacitate and intimidate, yet are not stamped out by the International Rugby Board. Its attitude to violence has always been token rejection rather than determined eradication. Rugby, we are told, is a man's game. As Pierre Berbizier, the former French scrum-half and current Italian coach, said in 1995: 'If you can't take a punch, you should play table tennis.' Manly rugby types would nod in agreement and look away when news came through last year that 24-year-old Riaan Loots had been felled by a stiff-arm tackle and kicked to death in a club match in South Africa. Violence, tragically for the game's future development, is an integral and accepted part of rugby at every level, seen in schools as well as club matches, in the Heineken European Cup and the French National Championships. The World Cup is a chance for the game to reject its beastliness, but for that to happen, the IRB will have to take off the blinkers. Beauty must be allowed to triumph. That is how the game, with its camaraderie, brilliance and courage, can delight new followers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
