But it was not just the cuisine - lightly cooked sea bass, accompanied by a New World wine - that was nouvelle at last Thursday's private dinner. The hosts were a group of Conservative thirtysomething new boys, part of the 'Class of 2005' - the party's largest clutch of new MPs for more than two decades. And they were meeting to mark the publication of a slender purple paperback which they hope will help propel their party from the wilderness of opposition back into government. The handful of MPs who gathered for dinner at the Reform Club, co-authors of Direct Democracy, ambitiously subtitled 'An Agenda for a New-Model Party', are the intellectual avant-garde of the Class of 2005. They are passionately convinced the Tories' best hope lies in adopting an American-style 'localism' that would aggressively shrink the role of central government in every area of British life, from primary schools to the police. But their book, serialised last week in the Telegraph and published tomorrow, has also focused attention on the potentially decisive role which the 55 new Conservative MPs could play in choosing who will take over the party leadership. Observer interviews with nearly a third of the new MPs suggest that, far from having decided how they will vote in the leadership race, they are happy to wait, watch - and be wooed. 'I know all of the contenders about equally - which is to say not very well,' said Justine Greening, 36, a businesswoman and former local councillor who reclaimed David Mellor's old seat of Putney for the Tories. 'I'll be looking at how the candidates perform - just like the vast majority of the electorate sets out to choose their MP.' As she and others in the new intake began to move last week from hot-desking to something approaching normal parliamentary existence, it seemed every Tory with even a remote chance of figuring in the leadership contest had discovered the beauties of 'localism'. It was a sign that the contest was moving into a higher gear and that the new MPs - more than a quarter of the parliamentary party - were becoming a focus of their affections. The week began with the frontrunner, Shadow Home Secretary David Davis, making a pitch for broadly based party support on a power-to-the-people plank that sounded remarkably like the call from the young localists. The contest also began to get more crowded, with remarks sounding very much like campaign speeches from three party 'modernisers' - Shadow Transport Secretary Alan Duncan, his predecessor, Damian Green, and, perhaps most intriguingly for the new MPs, Malcolm Rifkind, the Shadow Pensions Secretary. Rifkind is technically a new boy himself, having just returned to the Commons after eight years away. But he also has a heavyweight pedigree, having served as both Foreign and Defence Secretary when the Tories were last in government. He, too, wasted little time in declaring himself a fan of 'localism', though rival backers of the emerging contenders privately conceded that it was far from clear how effective that mantra would prove with the new MPs when it came to chosing a leader. Not only are they the largest group of Tory newcomers in the Commons for years, they are also, by old Conservative standards, remarkably varied. They include the familiar accountants, lawyers and businesspeople, but fairly few Oxbridge graduates, as well as a number with council-house childhoods or, like Greening, a comprehensive education. What they appear to share is an uncommonly close bond for new MPs - many were chosen as candidates early in the last parliament and went through countless party briefings and training sessions together - and a conviction, beyond specific policy differences or any early preference for a particular candidate, that the party must greatly broaden its popular appeal if it is going to return to government. They also say that the call for a 'new localism' chimes with what they heard on the campaign doorstep. David Davies, the new Monmouthshire MP and former Welsh Assembly member, was puzzlingly described by one national newspaper as 'even more right-wing than his near-namesake [David Davis]'. But Davies told The Observer, without serious fear of contradiction, that he was 'probably the only new Conservative MP who used to wear earrings'. Davies roamed the world after leaving school, working briefly harvesting grapes and tobacco, before getting a job at a backpackers' hostel in Queensland. He recalls that he used to pinch himself when he reflected he 'was actually making a living by taking surfers into bars every evening, with about a hundred dollars' worth of booze - on account'. Now 34, he still surfs whenever he gets a chance but is more preoccupied with how the Tories can again become a party of government. 'We have to look at areas of social deprivation,' he says. 'We have to demonstrate that a right-of-centre party can offer something to the least well-off. We must be a party for all of Britain.' It is a message echoed by Stephen Crabb, who is three years younger than Davies, and the new MP for Preseli Pembrokeshire. With his own brand of 'localism,' he has spent his first days in parliament determined to prove to the voters, who gave him a majority of under a thousand in 'one of the poorest areas in the country', that they have made the right choice. Having been raised 'in social housing, in a single-parent family', he says that whoever emerges as the new leader must have 'a vision of how we can reconnect the party with the kind of people I grew up with, to develop a coherent programme that will improve the lives of ordinary people - in contrast with the image of the Conservatives as a party of wealth, greed, or any of those other labels'. Another new boy, 33-year-old James Duddridge, the Rochford and Southend MP, who worked for Barclays in Africa during his twenties, would at first glance seem a sure backer for Davis or another leadership candidate on the party's right. 'I am very much a Eurosceptic,' he said, pointing out that he is filling the seat previously held by Teddy Taylor, who raised Brussels-bashing almost to a political art form. But he, too, says he will be looking for a leader who 'can command the respect of the floating voters we need to win the election. We need a leader who resonates with the people, not just the party - someone who has that Factor X.' Douglas Carswell, the lanky, 34-year-old MP for Harwich, is one of 10 new Tory legislators who helped write the book on 'direct democracy'. He has no doubt that radical new thinking must underpin any effort to broaden the party's appeal. A member of the party's policy unit before becoming a parliamentary candidate, he argues for a wholesale return of power, resources and responsibilities from central government to the local level. This would mean a local sales tax instead of VAT, with local control over police and other services; and an end to central government provision - as opposed to funding - of the health service. Who could best lead a Tory revival? By the time the espresso and chocolates came around at the Reform Club on Thursday night, the inevitable gossip about who might emerge as leader had given way to talk about the need to have a real debate on the party's future direction first. 'If you want to make a blockbuster,' Carswell told The Observer, 'make sure you have a script and a storyline before the cast of characters.' Rifkind has found building bridges particularly easy; as a nominal newcomer, he has attended a number of events for new MPs. Davis has been busy, too. No sooner had the newcomers arrived than they received an email from him inviting them to a reception in the shadow cabinet room to 'discuss any issues on Home Affairs'. 'To be fair,' one of the invited MPs remarked, 'it was low-key, not at all with a feeling of electioneering. Other shadow cabinet ministers have also invited us - Theresa May had an event, and there is Redwood this week. We've even been asked along for meetings with Jack Straw, to see how the Foreign Office works, and [Education Secretary] Ruth Kelly, and as far as I know neither of them is running for Tory leader. But of course we know Davis is a candidate. We know we'll get invitations from others.' 'And yes,' he said, while hastening to add he had not made up his mind who he would like to see as leader, 'the Davis reception was very nice. Theresa May served wine. Davis's was champagne.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
