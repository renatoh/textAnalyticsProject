The debut album from the Joy Formidable sounds as if it was recorded as some kind of sonic weapon. And singer/guitarist Ritzy Bryan seems to feel one of her is nowhere near enough: her guitar tracks are heaped on each other, until the whole edifice is teetering under its own weight, and her voice is layered and treated into a smooth, shiny facade. In small doses, this kind of shoegaze-grunge hybrid \u2013 it's a bit of both, without ever really being either \u2013 is invigorating, but The Big Roar isn't a small dose. The opening track, The Everchanging Spectrum of a Lie (they have a weakness for portentous titles) meanders on beyond seven minutes without ever improving on its opening verse and chorus. Its shortcomings are thrown into relief by its brisk and taut successor, The Magnifying Glass. After 50 minutes of unyielding assault, The Big Roar will leave the uncommitted whimpering."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
