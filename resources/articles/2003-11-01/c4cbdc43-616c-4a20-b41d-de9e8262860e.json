Bristol Rovers swept all before them in the Southern Division last season but life in the Premiership, they found on their promotion, was a different matter altogether. Before long they were floundering at the bottom of the table. That's when they called in Ivor Gumm. He has fast acquired a reputation in the women's game as a survival specialist. Southampton had made him their manager with nine games of last season remaining in the hope that he would help them stay in the top flight. But he arrived too late, the Saints went down and he was ejected (in an economy measure) in favour of the club's resident head of women's football, Sue Lopez. But a few weeks ago he popped up at Bristol Rovers, where he has again been charged with keeping the team in the Premiership. \"Teams seem to think when they're struggling that I've got a big shovel and can get them out the mire,\" he said. So far he has lost only two of seven matches. He has also been making waves in the Solent. Southampton's Toni-Anne Wayne and Alex Cottier, a former Saints captain, both chose to leave a side backed by a men's Premiership club to join him in Bristol. The women, Gumm said, were \"nervous and panicky, tense and tight\" when he took over. They were also bottom of the table. \"Confidence,\" he said, \"is a frightening word. But you've got to get them relaxing and believing in themselves.\" Unfortunately that didn't quite happen yesterday, when the \"fear factor\" of a visit from Arsenal gave rise to a 3-0 defeat, the first credited as an Aisha Martyn own-goal, Jayne Ludlow and Ellen Maggs adding the others. The match that will go a long way towards deciding this season's champions, the return meeting between Fulham and Charlton, was postponed because of a waterlogged pitch. Doncaster Rovers Belles won 5-2 at Everton, Aston Villa were held to a 1-1 draw by visiting Leeds and Tranmere lost 2-1 at home to Birmingham."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
