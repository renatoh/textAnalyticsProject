In the first programme, he shared the platform with his regular cellist partner Yo-Yo Ma in a unity of approach and gesture that made every item a true duo. Schumann came first. It's not often remembered that he studied the cello briefly as a youngster, though only one of the works here was written for the instrument. The Five Pieces in Folk Style are a group of character pieces, full of the quirkiness and idiosyncrasy typical of Schumann in his late period. Ma was particularly adept at finding the ideal weight as well as colour of tone to express their essential natures, but not even with both players at their most imaginative did the Adagio and Allegro written for horn sound ideal in its alternative cello format. The Three Fantasy Pieces conceived for clarinet worked surprisingly well, though, with Ma's sense of spontaneity matched by Ax in every note. Even more than Schumann, Chopin is so indelibly associated with the solo piano that the existence of his substantial sonata for cello comes as a surprise. But it's a passionate and expertly composed piece, dynamically delivered here by both players in a striking realisation of its thematic material. There was a new piece, too, jointly commissioned by the Barbican to celebrate Schumann's bicentenary. The American Peter Lieberson's Remembering Schumann makes the occasional specific reference to its subject's music but generally contents itself with emulating his fantasy and freedom in a less specific idiom. Pleasant if discursive, it registered as pallid beside its models, especially when performed with this level of commitment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
