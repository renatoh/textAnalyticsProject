The party\u2019s economics spokesman, Toni Rold\u00e1n, announced on Monday that he was leaving Citizens and renouncing his seat in the Spanish parliament in protest at the party\u2019s drift to the right and its willingness to enter alliances with the far right after regional and municipal elections. Rold\u00e1n is the latest figure to publicly question the wisdom of vacating the centre as Citizens tries to stake its claim to being Spain\u2019s main opposition party. The former French prime minister Manuel Valls, who Citizens had backed in his unsuccessful bid to become mayor of Barcelona, had repeatedly urged the party to have nothing to do with the upstart far-right Vox party. But it ignored his pleas and has enlisted Vox\u2019s help in building coalitions with the conservative People\u2019s party to rule the southern region of Andaluc\u00eda and run Madrid\u2019s city council. \u201cFor a while now, the leadership of the party to which I belong has taken a strategic decision, which is legitimate, but which is one I do not agree with,\u201d said Rold\u00e1n. \u201cI\u2019ve expressed my disagreement at every opportunity \u2026 but I haven\u2019t been successful. You can\u2019t spend too long being what you\u2019re not. All political strategies have costs, but in my opinion, the costs for Spain are too high when it comes to the strategy Citizens has chosen.\u201d Rold\u00e1n said the party\u2019s recent lurch to the right had violated the three principles on which the party was founded: reform, regeneration and the battle against nationalism. \u201cHow are we going to move past the clash of red and blue \u2013 which is what we came to do \u2013 if we ourselves turn into blues?\u201d he said. \u201cHow are we going to build a liberal project in Spain if we can\u2019t confront the far right?\u201d Rold\u00e1n also called on the party\u2019s leader, Albert Rivera, to rethink his refusal to enter into a coalition government with the socialist PSOE party, which won the most votes in April\u2019s general election but fell short of a majority. Rivera has emphatically ruled out any deals that would help the PSOE\u2019s leader, acting prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, return to office. \u201cHow many European countries can only dream of having a strong, sensible, reformist and pro-European majority in the centre?\u201d said Rold\u00e1n. The party, he added, appeared to have chosen expediency over the ideals it had once professed. \u201cI\u2019m not going because I\u2019ve changed but because Citizens has changed,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not what I signed up for. Politics isn\u2019t a supermarket. We don\u2019t sell products here that can be swapped from one day to the next \u2013 we sell ideas.\u201d In\u00e9s Arrimadas, Citizens\u2019 spokeswoman in congress, said she had \u201conly good things to say about Rold\u00e1n\u201d and wished him all the best on a personal level. However, she also pointed out that the party\u2019s current approach had been unanimously approved by the executive committee \u2013 including Rold\u00e1n. Javier Nart, a Citizens MEP, resigned from the party\u2019s executive committee on Monday afternoon after its members voted to maintain the party\u2019s veto on facilitating S\u00e1nchez\u2019s investiture as prime minister. Last week, Valls also attacked Citizens, lamenting its failure to live up to its values. \u201cWhen I moved to Barcelona a year ago, Citizens was a liberal, progressive, centrist and pro-European party,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, little by little, the party with which I had so much in common began to change into something different.\u201d Valls said Citizens had become a party that did deals with Vox \u2013 \u201ca reactionary and anti-European party\u201d. Citizens, which bitterly opposes Catalan independence, broke with Valls after he eventually threw his support behind Barcelona\u2019s incumbent mayor, Ada Colau, even though her return stopped the Catalan capital from being run by the secessionist Catalan Republican Left party. One of the party\u2019s founders has also been increasingly critical of Rivera\u2019s strategy and suggested a coalition with the socialists would have been the logical course of action. \u201cIt was a mistake for Citizens to move away from the centre ground,\u201d Francesc de Carreras told the online newspaper Eldiario.es. The professor of law had gone further in a recent open letter to Rivera that was published in El Pa\u00eds. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re letting us down now, Albert, or why Citizens is letting us down,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHow has that mature and responsible young man turned into a fickle adolescent who\u2019s performed a strategic volte-face and put the supposed interests of his party above the general interest of Spain?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
