In a statement on Wednesday, the Cabinet Office - which has responsibility for the use and security of computers across central government - said: \"Government departments have been issued an alert on how to deal with this particular incident and to mitigate against vulnerabilities in relation to particular versions of IE. \" Google announced last week that its email systems and network had been penetrated by malware apparently developed by Chinese hackers, who are widely suspected of acting for the government in China. A weakness in Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser was apparently exploited to give unauthorised access. Microsoft subsequently said that the flaw that gave the hackers access would almost certainly have been in Internet Explorer 6, which was first released in 2000, running on Windows XP, which was launched in 2001. Microsoft will on Thursday release a patch for IE to protect against the vulnerability. However the UK government is a substantial user of IE6, with a number of departments and the armed forces using it. Earlier this week the Cabinet Office referred queries about how government departments were protected against malware to the Get Safe Online website, which it half funds. That advises that \"All web browsers are at ongoing risk to vulnerabilities and as such Get Safe Online's recommended advice is always to use the most up-to-date version to ensure that you have the latest security features in place. However, if you have particular concerns about a specific browser, it's very simple for home users and small businesses to download an alternative and run it concurrently.\" But it was not clear whether government departments would upgrade, or move to different browsers. The latest statement does not suggest that alternative browsers are to be used. The French and German governments have issued advisories in the past week suggesting that citizens use alternative browsers to IE, which is targeted by hackers because it is widely used - and people using old versions are also unlikely to be using effective security. Among the alternative browsers are Firefox, Google's Chrome, Apple's Safari, and Opera. The Cabinet Office added: \"A government user, operating on government systems, such as the GSi (Government Secure Intranet), will benefit from additional security measures, unlikely to be available to the average home computer user. These include tools which actively monitor for evidence of any malicious attacks.\" It is not clear whether those tools would be able to record malicious attacks using previously unknown malware - so-called \"zero-day vulnerabilities\", such as that used against Google. It is also unclear whether there is a clear government-wide timetable to update its installations of Internet Explorer from version 6."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
