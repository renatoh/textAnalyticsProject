Just as some elements of the upper classes might find the concept of purchasing property infra dig, so in new media there is a certain amount of sniffiness about buying success. The madness of the dotcom boom left a mark, but perhaps not an indelible one. Recently, new media assets have been snapped up by old media companies. In the past fortnight, Associated Newspapers, owner of the Daily Mail, has bought SimplySwitch, a utilities comparison service, for \u00a322m, and Pearson, publisher of the Financial Times, paid \u00a3101m for MergerMarket, which reports on mergers internationally. ITV attracted criticism for its \u00a3172m purchase of FriendsReunited, and in the US the two startling purchases were Rupert Murdoch's News Corp buying the social networking site MySpace and the TV network NBC paying $600m for the women's interest website iVillage. Some of these purchases - certainly MySpace - have proved inspired. But given the sums of money involved, is there a case for investing rather than handing large sums of money to individuals and seed fund managers? It makes sense for Associated Newspapers to buy a comparisons search engine business, because it fits with a consumer information brand, but the guts of what it does and the skills of the people who do it are a million miles away from the traditional skills of a newspaper. Similarly, MySpace employs over 160 developers but no one to generate content - the community does that - again, this way of working is anathema to media corporations. It is harder to see why the FT, with its international financial brand and its worldwide network of journalists, would buy something similar rather than divert more of that money into its own web development. Technical development is invariably more expensive and takes longer than traditional broadcasters and publishers realise but a fairly spectacular effect is still possible for $100m. In the main, these acquisitions make most sense when they bring new skills, perspectives and crucially revenues into a business that has little realistic prospect of growing them within a reasonable timeframe. Part of the problem for most media organisations is that they are relatively shallow in technical knowledge, and, where it exists, it is rarely either properly recognised or rewarded. Howard Stringer, head of Sony, recently tried to demonstrate to his entertainment division how the power was shifting to a new type of creative. At a gathering of his heads of department, he reserved the first two rows of the audience for his games and interactive developers; he invited Steven Spielberg to speak, after which the film director shook hands with the younger \"techies\" rather than the older suits. Stringer said the point of this exercise was to wake up the old order who didn't \"get it\". There is some evidence that the mainstream media has already missed the boat in terms of the new wave of web development, and this is why it has to buy rather than build. It should worry traditional media companies that all the really radical ideas for connecting audiences and content - whether it is a MySpace (not that radical but hugely effective), or Google, or Flickr - have all evolved from a skillset of engineers who had no desire to work for a traditional company and whom traditional media companies would have had difficulty in containing. We are used in the media to the power residing with the editors, producers and directors, but in the next decade this will have to change to include the creative technologist. And if you don't have them, you should buy some. \u00b7 Emily Bell is editor-in-chief of Guardian Unlimited. emily.bell@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
