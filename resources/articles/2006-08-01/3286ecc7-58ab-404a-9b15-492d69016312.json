In a receiving line with her parents, an aunt and four siblings, Yanti greeted her future husband with a handshake and the merest flicker of a smile as he arrived with relatives. He gave a nod and quickly moved on to the next person in line. The affection level barely rose throughout the evening. Yanti and Tri did not kiss - not even after the Muslim cleric who officiated at the ceremony declared them husband and wife. They were disinclined to cuddle up, even when cajoled by the photographer. The truth behind the frostiness is a sinister and sad indictment of the traditions that persist in many parts of Indonesia. Not only had Yanti, 22, a restaurant cook, and Tri, 24, a maize and sweet potato farmer, just met, they barely knew anything about each other. 'Er, what does he like to do in his spare time?' Yanti hurriedly asked a cousin when probed by The Observer the day before the nuptials. Despite her protestations, it was clear that Yanti was uncomfortable with the process that had led to the ceremony in a specially erected bamboo and corrugated-iron-roofed 'marquee' outside her parents' mud-floor house. A little over two months ago Tri announced that he wanted to marry a girl from central Java. 'I think they're cooler and more fun,' he told The Observer by way of explanation. The fact that he did not know any did not deter him. When a vague acquaintance, Fajar, said he had a cousin, Mursiyati, who might be appropriate, Tri accepted immediately. Pressurised by her parents into accepting Tri's offer - the fact that he had a one-and-a-quarter-acre farm being too tempting a lure for Mursiyati's labourer father - Mursiyati agreed to the match. A month later Mursiyati met someone she liked, called off the wedding and married her new boyfriend instead. Despite the setback Tri was still determined to marry a central Java woman and Fajar felt obligated to provide one. So early in June the family came up with Yanti, a cousin of Fajar. Again the fact that Tri had 10 times more land than Yanti's father proved the crucial factor. 'As soon as I heard her voice, saw her photo and learnt she was a cook, I knew that she was the woman for me,' Tri said, without much conviction. Yanti said she was 'happy and excited' at the prospect of marrying Tri, but her father, Saulusmin, was not. 'I mean they haven't even met - how can they get married?' he said. But like Yanti, Saulusmin did not dare to stand up to his wife, Gina. 'She would have got so angry with me if I'd objected it would not have been pleasant,' Saulusmin said. 'So I decided to let her have her way.' It is impossible to know how many Indonesians end up in such marriages. Saman, the cleric who married Yanti and Tri, said 'extreme' stories such as theirs, where the couple had not even met, accounted for perhaps 1 per cent of marriages. 'But there are many marriages organised by the parents where the children do what they're told,' he said. Tini, a maid in Jakarta who ran away for three days after her parents tried to force her, at the age of 15, to marry a 28-year-old, reckons about a third of all unions in her district are undertaken without the participants' full consent. 'It's not as bad as it was but from what I hear it is still very prevalent in rural areas,' she said. World Vision, an international aid agency, describes the practice as 'still common' and experts say it is unlikely to die out soon. 'It's the tradition and it's hard to go against traditions,' said Gadis Arivia, the executive director of the women's group Jurnal Perempuan. 'Parents don't believe in modern practices, particularly when they see divorce rates going up. On the daughter's part if you obey your parents you are supported. The disobedient ones have a much harder life.' A significant contributing factor is that in many communities traditions and religious leaders are more highly respected than national legislation. 'Many of these girls do not have birth certificates because their parents did not have marriage certificates and the cycle continues,' Lies said. Indonesia's string of recent natural disasters, such as the 2004 tsunami in Aceh that killed 130,000 people, and communal conflicts, such as the ones in the Moluccas and Sulawesi, have also perpetuated the tradition, according to Samsidar, a commissioner of the National Commission for Violence Against Women. 'It's traditional in situations where women have died for their younger sisters to look after their children and this usually means they have to marry the widower,' she said. There is also a strong economic side to it. 'After something like the tsunami many people were in a very bad way financially,' Samsidar said. 'So we saw a lot of people hurrying to marry off their children to make their own lives that much easier. The daughters don't feel they can reject what's been arranged and they can't really run away because they have no financial independence.' Improving Indonesia's poor education system is the key to ending unhappy arranged marriages, Samsidar said. 'The government says its policy is nine years' education for all, but many Indonesians cannot afford to travel to the nearest junior high school, let alone pay the fees to get in. ' No one from the state Ministry of Women's Empowerment was available to discuss the issue Back in Bumi Agung, as the sound of the generator competed with the folk pop blaring out of the sound system, Yanti was continuing to put a brave face on. 'As long as I don't have to go to work again - it's his job to provide for me - and can have a couple of children, then I'll be happy,' she said. 'And I'll probably be able to come back and visit once a year.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
