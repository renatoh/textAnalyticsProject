The most obvious indication is the return this weekend of Spooks, resurrected on the big screen four years after the TV series came to an end. Then there is the arrival on BBC2 of 70s-set spy drama The Game, which channels John le Carr\u00e9\u2019s Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy to tell a seductive tale of subterfuge, divided loyalties and secret wars. The highly anticipated London Spy, written by bestselling author Tom Rob Smith, starring Ben Whishaw, Charlotte Rampling and Jim Broadbent, will arrive on the same channel later this year, while in the US the spy drama The Americans continues to win critical acclaim (UK audiences can watch the first two series on Amazon Prime Instant Video). Spy fiction is also back in vogue, from last year\u2019s summer hit I Am Pilgrim to the popular recent reissue of Lionel Davidson\u2019s 1994 cold war-set Kolymsky Heights, hailed by Philip Pullman as \u201cthe best thriller I\u2019ve ever read\u201d. What\u2019s driving the revival? bestsellers back towards more ambiguous fare. \u201cModern spy dramas are more sophisticated, they\u2019re bleaker and darker,\u201d says spy novelist Jeremy Duns, whose Paul Dark series centres on a KGB agent anti-hero. \u201cWhile writers such as John le Carr\u00e9 and Graham Greene have always had that moral uncertainty, it left spy fiction in the 90s and post-9/11 you had a glut of tough macho thrillers about special forces heroes. That\u2019s now shifting back towards the morally grey \u2026 You can root for a protagonist even if you don\u2019t like what they do, so in Homeland you\u2019re not condemning Brody to the degree you would have done 10 years ago, while The Americans has us rooting for Russian agents in 1980s America in a way that would have been impossible on US TV in the actual 80s.\u201d Hannah Griffiths, Fiction Publisher at Faber &amp; Faber, who reissued Kolymsky Heights, agrees: \u201cThere\u2019s a moral ambiguity with spy fiction that appeals to readers,\u201d she says. \u201cReaders respond to the fact it\u2019s not as straightforward as right and wrong, good and evil, which means they can find their own way morally and make up their own minds.\u201d There is also the sense that the cold war era provides an interesting counterpoint to our own turbulent times. \u201cEven modern-set spy thrillers such as the Bourne films feel very cold war to me, with the chases through the German underground being straight out of [1966 spy movie] The Quiller Memorandum,\u201d says Duns. \u201cHomeland, with the cat- and-mouse chase of its traitor, a former American soldier, [or] the Daniel Craig Bonds, which are a world away from the [Pierce] Brosnan era, combine genuine suspense with an emotional weight that wasn\u2019t there before. The spectre of the cold war is all over this stuff \u2026 [I think because] it\u2019s our very recent past and we tend to be interested in the recent past.\u201d According to Toby Whithouse, the writer behind The Game: \u201cThe 70s don\u2019t feel far away at all. What attracted me to the period was the idea of this secret war where great victories could never be celebrated or conspicuously rewarded and great losses were dealt with in private. I wanted to look at an entire war conducted in the shadows and the effect that would have on personalities. There\u2019s also a romantic element \u2013 the whole idea of secret codes and rendezvous and the low-fi nature of the work.\u201d Yet not everyone is as happy with the genre\u2019s continued cold war focus. Simon Conway, whose most recent thriller, the dark, brutal The Agent Runner, moves from the backstreets of Bethnal Green to Pakistan\u2019s border badlands, feels that our obsession with one particular strain of spy fiction prevents the genre from saying anything new. \u201cWe love that whole idea of a game of rules and elegant suits and period costumes and gentlemen\u2019s clubs, but if we want to understand the world as it is today, then we need to understand what\u2019s happening in Afghanistan and Pakistan,\u201d he says. \u201cThe trouble is that those stories appear too alien and asymmetric. They can\u2019t be reduced to a game of chess between equals, so its easier to write comfortable period pieces than to try to understand what\u2019s going on in Syria, Libya and Afghanistan. I thought The Honourable Woman was great, and Spooks is fun, and always reminds me of The Professionals [but] there\u2019s a tendency to forget how very angry le Carr\u00e9\u2019s original novels are. \u201cThe spy thriller should reflect the world as it is, rather than becoming reassuring Sunday-evening TV.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
