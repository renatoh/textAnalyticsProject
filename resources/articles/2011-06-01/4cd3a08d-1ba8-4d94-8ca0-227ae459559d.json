The \"scratchy homemade film\" was, in fact, a professional production co-directed, written and produced by the late James Hill (director of Born Free) and my late husband, Bill Travers. It was first shown in the mid-70s and it was networked on USATV (Christian \u2013 the Lion at World's End, can be obtained from The Born Free Foundation). The opportunity for Christian to be rehabilitated in the wild by George Adamson in 1970 was entirely due to the vision and professional expertise of my husband. In fact, it was John Rendall and Ace Bourke who asked him if he could help, as they did not want the lion to go to a zoo. Without him who knows what future Christian would have had. Bill's strong friendship with George enabled this remarkable story to take place. Together they found a location for the rehabilitation acceptable to the Kenya government \u2013 Kora national reserve. However, the lion did not go straight to Kenya from London. He spent four months in a specially built enclosure in our garden. Is that not part of the story? Credit should always be given when it is due. Here it is regrettably lacking.
