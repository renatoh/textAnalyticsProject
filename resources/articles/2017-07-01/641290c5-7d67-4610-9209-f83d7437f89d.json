Confederate, depicting the events leading up to a third conflict between the north and south, will be written by the showrunners and take place in an alternative timeline in which the southern states have successfully seceded, \u201cgiving rise to a nation in which slavery remains legal and has evolved into a modern institution\u201d. A statement released by HBO read: \u201cThe story follows a broad swath of characters on both sides of the Mason-Dixon Demilitarized Zone \u2013 freedom fighters, slave hunters, politicians, abolitionists, journalists, the executives of a slave-holding conglomerate and the families of people in their thrall.\u201d Production on the new series will begin after the final season of Game of Thrones. The first installment of the seventh season premiered Sunday night, drawing a record-breaking 16.1 million viewers (including streaming), a 50% increase from the season six premiere. The episode was the most-watched season premiere of any HBO series to date. \u201cWe are thrilled to be able to continue our relationship with Dan and David, knowing that any subject they take on will result in a unique and ambitious series,\u201d said Casey Bloys, the president of programming at the network. The news comes just a few months after HBO announced that several Game of Thrones spin-off series are in the works, although neither Benioff nor Weiss will be working on them. \u201cWe have discussed Confederate for years, originally as a concept for a feature film,\u201d said Benioff and Weiss in a statement. \u201cBut our experience on Thrones has convinced us that no one provides a bigger, better storytelling canvas than HBO. There won\u2019t be dragons or White Walkers in this series, but we are creating a world, and we couldn\u2019t imagine better partners in world-building than [co-writers and co-executive producers] Nichelle and Malcolm [Spellman], who have impressed us for a long time with their wit, their imagination and their Scrabble-playing skills.\u201d The HBO drama series Westworld recently led the pack with 22 Emmy award nominations. Game of Thrones won the award for outstanding drama series in 2016 and broke the record for Emmy nominations in 2015 with 24."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
