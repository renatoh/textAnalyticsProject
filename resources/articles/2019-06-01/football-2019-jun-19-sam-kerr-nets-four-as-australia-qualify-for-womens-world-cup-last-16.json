Naming her \u201cthe best player in the world\u201d pre-game, Jamaican coach Hue Menzies identified stopping Kerr and cutting out Australia\u2019s supply from wide areas as his side\u2019s two chief challenges. They could do neither. And yet for over 60 minutes the Reggae Girlz delighted 17,402 fans, finally delivering a performance in keeping with their prodigious potential. Havana Solaun sent Jamaica\u2019s fans into rapture shortly after the interval with their first ever World Cup goal. It was a work of art. Khadija Shaw won the ball through pure determination, before feeding an exquisite pass that bisected Australia\u2019s defence. Except that either side of this historic moment, Kerr would have her say. As Australia\u2019s position on the Group C live-table bounced dramatically \u2013 Marta\u2019s penalty against Italy momentarily sending the Matildas into third \u2013 1,200 travelling Matildas fans cancelled AirBnBs in Nice, furiously researched Le Havre or Grenoble, before again settling on France\u2019s coastal gem. The permutations weren\u2019t resolved until the final minute and the final kick. It kept a nervous tension inside the Stade des Alpes with as many dramatic peaks and troughs as Grenoble\u2019s famous vistas. Milicic was full of praise for Kerr and her qualities both as a goal scorer and a captain. \u201cShe\u2019s an inspirational leader,\u201d he said. \u201cWe as an Australian footballing community should be thankful that we\u2019re witnessing one of the best players in the world, live. If there\u2019s one player that you\u2019re really happy to score the goals, it\u2019s Sammy. So I\u2019m delighted for her \u2013 it\u2019s history, as an Australian player at a World Cup to do what she\u2019s done.\u201d A traveller to Grenoble doesn\u2019t associate the Alps with blistering heat but under the watchful eye of the Chartreuse mountains a 29C sun shone even at 9pm local for kick-off. Fired with a desire to show better than their opening two matches, Jamaica ratcheted the heat and the tempo \u2013 flyer Mireya Grey twice rounding young left-back Karly Roestbakken, who was handed her first Matildas start. A vocal travelling Jamaica support was quickly quietened, with just 11 minutes gone Australia\u2019s goal-getter-in-chief Kerr rose highest off Emily Gielnik\u2019s cross \u2013 a sixth strike in nine games under the coach who handed her the armband. Despite the complex permutations surrounding how the Matildas could yet finish top of Group C, Ante Milicic promised pre-game that his side would stick to their principles. Dominating possession and building from the back with patience \u2013 there would be no kick and rush to chase goal difference. As a gentler match cadence settled in, Australia continued to probe down the periphery. The solar-powered Ellie Carpenter looked to maraud and overload with aplomb \u2013 delivery from deep the modus operandi for Australiae. The bustling Khadija Shaw, dropping deeper to her preferred attacking midfield position, looked to spark a fire once more \u2013 the 180cm wrecking-ball left her mark on Carpenter with one robust challenge, before firing a Roberto Carlos-esque free-kick from long range to re-invigorate the Jamaican fan contingent. But if Jamaica had planned for an aerial bombardment, they couldn\u2019t prevent it. Katrina Gorry turned provider just before half time and again it was talisman, Kerr, who left Nicole McClure flat-footed between the posts. She wouldn\u2019t stop there, capping one of the all-time striker\u2019s World Cup performances to guide Australia through to the last 16, with Italy top on goal difference, and Brazil third on goals scored."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
