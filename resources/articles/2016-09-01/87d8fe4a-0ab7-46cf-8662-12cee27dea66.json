The list of eligible children who are stuck in the camps in Calais has been drawn up by Citizens UK and given to Amber Rudd, and the demand for immediate action endorsed by Alf Dubs \u2013 the Labour peer and long-time refugee campaigner. It comes as a group of more than 100 faith leaders, council chiefs and celebrities, including Juliet Stevenson and Vanessa Redgrave, prepare to gather outside the Home Office on Friday at a memorial event marking the anniversary of the death of Alan Kurdi, the three-year-old Syrian boy whose body was washed up on a beach in Turkey. The plea for urgent action on child refugees in Calais also comes as a freedom of information request has revealed that the government spent more than \u00a3100,000 earlier this year in legal fees to make it harder to reunite refugees in Calais with their families in Britain. The list of 387 refugee children eligible to come to Britain is made up of the names of 178 children who have a right to come to the UK because of their close family links in the country and a further 209 children who qualify under the terms of the \u201cDubs\u201d amendment accepted by the government in March earlier this year. Lord Dubs said: \u201cI am deeply saddened that despite repeated calls from me and others the government still seems to be dragging its feet on the commitments made when the amendment in my name was accepted. \u201cNow that the new government has had some weeks to settle in after the EU referendum vote there really is no excuse for any further delay. Theresa May and Amber Rudd should be taking immediate action.\u201d Citizens UK says that to date the only children transferred from France to Britain have been those with family in the UK, largely involving those supported by its Safe Passage partnership: \u201cThis process takes months and at the present rate it will take over a year to help the 178 children identified,\u201d said a Citizens UK statement. \u201cTo date not one child has been transferred from France to Britain under the wider provisions of the Dubs amendment.\u201d A Home Office spokesperson said that more than 30 under-18s have been accepted for transfer within Europe since the Immigration Act 2016, which includes the Dubs amendment, reached the statute book in May and the majority had already arrived. A total of 120 unaccompanied children had been \u201caccepted for transfer\u201d under the Dublin III regulations since the start of the year. \u201cOur priority is to protect the best interests of children who are in need of our help. Last year there were over 3,000 claims for asylum in the UK by unaccompanied children, in addition to those who were already being cared for in the UK,\u201d said the Home Office spokesperson. \u201cWhile these children have made it to the UK, they still need support and we still need local authorities to agree to care for them.\u201d They added that they were in talks with the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, other partner organisations and the Italian, Greek and French governments to speed up mechanisms to identify, assess and transfer unaccompanied refugee children to Britain. \u201cWe continue to work closely with the French government to ensure that children in Calais with family links in the UK are identified, receive sufficient support and can access the Dublin family reunification process without delay,\u201d he added. But actor and campaigner Stevenson said the government had not shown the generosity to refugees it should. She said: \u201cOn this painful anniversary, when we remember a tiny Syrian boy lying drowned on a Turkish beach, a death which shook the world, it would be appropriate for the prime minister and home secretary to act to help stranded refugee children. We are only talking about fewer than 400 children. How can it be argued that Britain cannot cope in providing new homes for these children?\u201d Bishop Peter Hill, the Bishop of Barking, who visited Calais last week, added: \u201cI appeal to ministers to look into their hearts and take immediate action to bring these children to safety. It has been established that the UK has a legal obligation to these children, but more to the point, this country has a moral obligation.\u201d The government legal department\u2019s FoI response showed that more than \u00a365,000 was spent on barristers\u2019 fees and a further \u00a339,000 on \u201cinternal costs\u201d in successfully challenging an immigration tribunal ruling earlier this year that three Syrian teenagers and a 26-year-old man should immediately be brought to Britain and reunited with their families. But the information commissioner has had to step in and demand that the Home Office responds within 35 days to an FoI request asking for details of how many refugees have been transferred to the UK under the Dublin arrangements for family reunion in the past 12 months. Labour MPs will also press the home secretary on Monday for faster progress on child refugees and are expected to publish further legislation that would try to secure the removal of the children from the Calais camps before Christmas."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
