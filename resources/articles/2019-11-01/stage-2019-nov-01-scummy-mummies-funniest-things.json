Ellie: My son drew a picture of me that looked exactly like Hitler, and made me laugh for about half an hour. Then I waxed my top lip. The funniest heckle I\u2019ve ever had ... Helen: A very drunk Scotsman once stood up in the middle of the show and yelled out: \u201cYou\u2019ve got fantastic breasts!\u201d I wish he was at all my gigs. Ellie: My dad is our roadie, and as a veteran comedian himself, likes to shout ad libs after our punchlines. I now hide his hearing aids before we go on stage. The funniest meal I\u2019ve ever eaten ... Ellie: I went to a restaurant so posh that instead of a shaker, they give you a lump of Himalayan salt and a tiny grater. So there\u2019s a constant, low-level soundtrack of grating. The funniest thing that shouldn\u2019t be funny ... Ellie: My five-year-old son, who is south-east London born and bred, pronouncing his favourite pudding as \u201cchocolate arse cream.\u201d We laugh extra-hard when he does this in restaurants. The funniest number ... Helen: I think seven is always the funniest number. It\u2019s such a nowhere amount. Not quite 10; it\u2019s odd, it feels like a loner, a misfit. The funniest joke I\u2019ve ever heard ... Helen: What do you say to a man wearing clingfilm underpants? \u201cWell, I can clearly see your nuts!\u201d Scummy Mummies perform at Cheese and Grain, Frome, Thursday 7 November; touring to 1 December"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
