Outside, the snow is melting and the sky getting brighter but, with every lengthening day, the winter of his career with the German champions creeps in a little more. In June he will draw a line under 10 years\u2019 service and he fully admits the scale of what he has achieved takes some working through. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t realise sometimes,\u201d he says, still wondering how easy it can be to take pleasure in the moment when football just \u201ckeeps going, going, going\u201d and presents new obstacles every week. \u201cI\u2019m now 35, that\u2019s not young any more, not in football at least. I\u2019m still there playing as a winger at one of the best clubs in Europe, so that\u2019s something quite special.\u201d There has been no winger to match Robben in the modern era; no player who, from a perch close to the touchline, has been able to exert such a startling, dynamic influence for so long. He says his wife, Bernadien, sometimes reminds him to cherish his party piece, the acceleration infield and arrowed left-footed finish that has exposed opponents to ridicule time and again. The weight of evidence suggests the fault has rarely been theirs: it seems a simple action but, if that were the case, Robben could not have taken ownership of it so emphatically. \u201cI can be very proud of that because people say it\u2019s like your own move, running inside and scoring a goal,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s something I have been doing throughout the years and, well, it\u2019s still successful.\u201d It worked twice, to predictable yet thrilling effect, when Bayern beat Benfica 5-1 two months ago in his most recent match. \u201cWell, if you do it at the right time it still surprises them. Timing is the key, always.\u201d That was the case, too, when it came to managing his departure from Bayern. Robben deliberated with his family before announcing, in December, that his time was almost up, and it has given rise to what he calls \u201ca little bit of a strange period\u201d. There is the medium term to consider, with offers for next season hardly scarce; it competes with the immediate challenge, the one that has always preoccupied him above all, of the next game. Liverpool pose that test on Tuesday and for Robben, who knows every chance to exceed his 110 Champions League appearances must be grasped at this point, the prospect of Anfield in the last 16 summons a few spectres. His involvement against J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s side is in question because of a thigh injury but there is an imbalance he would like to redress. \u201cI think, if you ask [about] the worst stadium for me, it\u2019s probably Liverpool,\u201d he says. \u201cYou always have your favourite opponent and there always has to be a negative one.\u201d It is a rare glimpse of old wounds and partly explains why, when the fixture was confirmed, Robben called it \u201cthe worst possible draw\u201d for Bayern. He was there when, in 2004-05 and 2006-07, Chelsea fell maddeningly short in Champions League semi-finals. The first was decided by Luis Garc\u00eda\u2019s \u201cghost goal\u201d, and Robben prefers to leave it at \u201cwe\u2019ll never know\u201d when asked whether it went in. The second was settled on penalties, one of which he sent too close to Pepe Reina, and proved to be his penultimate match for the club. He remembers that as an \u201cemotional game\u201d and, both times, Chelsea were repelled by a formidable defensive blockade. \u201cAt that time [Liverpool] were really capable of being this cup fighter team, also in the FA Cup or [League] Cup,\u201d he says. \u201cIn one or two games they could really live up to it and perform; just not the whole season, which was maybe too much. That was their biggest quality: they were there at the moment they needed to be there. \u201cNow I think it changed and they developed really well. The manager has done a great job. Last year they were in the Champions League final and at the moment they are top [of the Premier League]. It\u2019s a long, long time ago that they won the league and that\u2019s the one they\u2019re dreaming of.\u201d Robben managed that feat twice at Chelsea as they broke their own hex, stretching back 50 years, in 2005 before retaining their title. \u201cWe played with two strikers, two wingers; it was really like a 4-4-2, a lot of offensive players,\u201d he remembers of a dashing Jos\u00e9 Mourinho side whose bravura nowadays feels as if it must be a trick of the memory. \u201cBut what I remember about that period is the team: a real team, all together, the players and characters all fitting together very, very well. We had a great manager as well in Mourinho, who made sure the team spirit was working well. And for me it was a big, big step because I was 20 years old [on arriving in 2004]. It was the first time I went abroad. Especially if you are that young, you have to grow up very quick.\u201d Eventually deemed too brittle at Chelsea before counting the cost of being an attacker at Real Madrid on the shoulder of the second gal\u00e1ctico wave, Robben has blossomed at Bayern. Although the feeling is alien now, in 2009 the move held muted appeal: the Bavarians\u2019 bulletproof self-confidence had taken some dents and it was not the gleaming superclub he represents now. \u201cI was at a big club, Real Madrid, and my goal was to win the Champions League at least once,\u201d he says. \u201cBayern were maybe not in the top five or 10 in Europe at that time, so that made my decision a little bit difficult because I had my ambitions. But in the end it was the best decision of my career. \u201cFrom that moment on I think the club \u2013 not because of me, don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 really started to develop, not only on the football side but in different areas.\u201d He plays down his own influence: had he not run on to a backheel from his left-sided analogue, Franck Rib\u00e9ry, to devastate Klopp and Borussia Dortmund at Wembley in 2013, then Bayern\u2019s wait for a Champions League would be nearing 20 years and his own need would be excruciating. It exorcised the ghost of another spot-kick miss, in the 2012 final against Chelsea, and is one success he readily recalls enjoying \u2013 \u201cperhaps that was one of my best summer holidays\u201d \u2013 but he believes none of it could have happened without the France international. \u201cI think these 10 years I have experienced would have been totally different without Franck,\u201d he says of Rib\u00e9ry. \u201cI think maybe also the other way round. That\u2019s something he has to say but we have achieved something amazing here at this club and I\u2019m only very thankful, as well, to him because without him it would have been different.\u201d After Wembley he spent what he loosely agrees were his best years under Pep Guardiola. \u201cNormally at 29, 30, you say you\u2019re not really going to improve yourself again and make steps. But with him I think I still developed as a player. He\u2019s just a very special guy in terms of tactics and the way he improves the game.\u201d His figures from that period are stunning and heighten the idea that, had he not missed around 160 games with niggling injuries at Bayern, he might be remembered in the Messi-Ronaldo-Neymar bracket rather than, more realistically, a notch beneath. \u201cYou have to stay close to yourself and I know I have done everything in my career to get the most out of it,\u201d he says. \u201cHopefully people have enjoyed it and there is nothing more I can do. This is what I am.\u201d He has no truck with regrets, even when reminded of the duel with Iker Casillas that might have stolen glory for the Netherlands in the 2010 World Cup final. \u201cYou can always say: \u2018What if?\u2019 but in the moment it goes like that\u201d \u2013 he snaps his fingers. \u201cYou have to decide what to do in one split second, and you will never know. There was still half an hour to play: Spain could still have attacked and scored. Of course it was a one-on-one and, by maybe one or two centimetres, it hit his toe and went out. And yet it was a good decision because he went the other way. So can you blame yourself? No, not really.\u201d It is the closest he has come to defensiveness during a relaxed conversation that he has spent draped on a sofa. There is the faintest dash of mischief in the atmosphere when he discusses his next move, which he expects to know before the end of the season. \u201cI\u2019ve always said that, as long as I enjoy it and physically feel good enough to perform at the level I want to, then I will continue,\u201d he says. \u201cI am also still curious where I will be next year. Maybe England, maybe Spain, maybe somewhere else: it can be anywhere. We will see.\u201d The mention of England has been dropped in deliberately, that much is obvious, but the prospect is left dangling and he is more expansive when it comes to the labours it will take to keep going. \u201cYou have to take care of your body, you have to sleep well, eat well, the normal things,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard work but you get something in return and that\u2019s why I do it.\u201d That payback sounds, for all his natural caution over the years, like something akin to intense enjoyment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
