The quiet, traditional lifestyle of the coast is prized by residents, many of whom say they are unfazed by decades of stagnant or declining growth \u2013 in fact, they prefer it that way. There are just over 30,000 \u201ccoasters\u201d spread out among a distance of some 500km. According to the latest New Zealand census, the west coast is the only region in New Zealand with a declining population, especially among children, with a 9% decrease in those aged 15 and under since 2013. During the gold rush of the late 1850s Hokitika had the second busiest port in the country and 91 pubs. At the height of the gold rush Hokitika was home to 15,000 people. Throughout the 20th century the population fluctuated as extractive industries followed the typical cycle of boom and bust; first gold, then forestry, then coal. Now, the population hovers around 4,000 and tourism and small businesses employing fewer than five people are the backbone of this salty town, which is home to people who like their space, their freedom and their relatively isolated way of life. \u201cDo we really need more people in our town?\u201d asks Westland mayor and founder of the Coasters club Bruce Smith. \u201cWhat we have now is pretty fantastic. I don\u2019t believe we need huge population growth to have a good life.\u201d Ninety-year-old Shirley Jones is a lifelong coaster, but says life is getting harder, with dwindling employment options as the extractive industries scale back or close for good. In Jones\u2019s youth, there was work aplenty, and she says she is worried the only way for the coast to boost its population is migration. It is a trend she isn\u2019t keen on, because she wants to keep jobs for locals. \u201cAt Blue Spur there was a school, a hall and two hotels or what now you\u2019d call pubs. All that is left now is the cemetery,\u201d says Jones, talking from her small, tidy room at the Allen Bryant retirement home. \u201cThere\u2019s no hustle and bustle here, there\u2019s no traffic jams. The train has gone and you see so many shops closing, it\u2019s a shame. If it wasn\u2019t for the dairy factory, I don\u2019t know what our boys would be doing. It\u2019s hard.\u201d More than a million tourists visit the coast every year \u2013 \u201clifesavers\u201d says Smith \u2013 but the small ratepayer base is struggling to fund infrastructure and facilities for visitors, and more investment from central government is needed, Smith says. The coast is also experiencing chronic shortages of professionals, including long-term struggles to fill vacancies for doctors, nurses, accountants and lawyers. Smith says he has pushed hard for the government to consider a bonded work scheme for new immigrants, and is \u201cmystified\u201d as to why it isn\u2019t a priority, with New Zealand\u2019s population distribution so unevenly spread. The outgoing Grey district mayor Tony Kokshoorn is also supportive of bonded migrant schemes, and laments the ongoing decline of his town, 30km north of Hokitika, which is still struggling to recover from the Pike River mine disaster of 2010, in which 29 people died. However, unlike Smith, Kokshoorn says the west coast needs more permanent residents, not just visitors, and more vitality \u2013 \u201cgrowth is good\u201d \u2013 he says. \u201cThe west coast in the past has been reluctant to welcome foreigners and immigrants; coasters thought that foreigners were taking their jobs and that kind of thing,\u201d Kokshoorn says. P\u0101keh\u0101 New Zealanders make up the bulk of Kokshoorn\u2019s constituents, with less than 1% of the country\u2019s M\u0101ori population living on the coast. \u201cBut over the last decade I have encouraged that we must be multicultural to get ahead in life. We only have 4 to 5 million people here. New Zealand can actually grow with the help of immigration.\u201d Kokshoorn says property prices dropped 30% in the nine years following the Pike river disaster and the liquidation and subsequent layoffs by Solid Energy, once the major employer for the town. Many young, working-age coasters left for highly paid jobs in Australia, and have not returned. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve been going through for the last nine years since Pike, there\u2019s no money washing around any more. There are no underground coalmines left in New Zealand now and our district relied entirely on underground coalmines. When I was a kid in 1970 there were thousands working in coalmines,\u201d says Kokshoorn. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone through a painful transition away from extractive industries to sustainability. And that\u2019s really taken its toll.\u201d Kokshoorn says the monolithic Warehouse in the centre of town and the rise of online shopping has also killed off the bricks-and-mortar trade of Greymouth, and the knock-on effect has been a loss of street life and vitality. \u201cWe are very isolated here. We also have a lot of natural calamities here. We have a pending earthquake they are talking about all the time. And we get a lot of cyclones now that do a lot of damage. We get severe weather conditions because of the mountain range and the heavy rainfall. They\u2019re tough things to overcome.\u201d However, Kookshoorn is an optimist and highlights some wins amid the tough decade \u2013 namely ultra-fast broadband access, rising tourism numbers and NZ$140m from central government as part of a national regional development programme. The money \u2013 described as a \u201cgodsend\u201d \u2013 is being used to boost infrastructure for tourism, and to invest in the rise of green minerals, such as lithium. Down the road in Hokitika, garnet is the latest hope, with the government investing NZ$10m in exploration work. \u201cLike any other rural place around the world we tend to lose out to the big cities. They get bigger and bigger while we stagnate. When your population is stagnant you haven\u2019t got growth. And whether people want to admit it or not we all live in a capitalist system, and capitalism depends on growth,\u201d says Kokshoorn. \u201cThe whole world is changing rapidly and we have no choice, we can\u2019t ignore it, we have to adjust the best we can. We have to be resilient.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
