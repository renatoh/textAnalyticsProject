Already a senior Labour backbencher, John McWilliam, MP for Blaydon, has said: \"If all charges have been dropped, somebody should be charged with wasting police time.\" The case's collapse turned on the revelation today, outlined by the prosecution, that Mr Burrell had told the Queen he had taken some of the possessions of Diana, the late princess of Wales. Mr Burrell had been accused of stealing more than 300 of the princess's possessions and the prosecution had advanced on the premise that he had told no one. The Queen, it has emerged, only realised once the trial had started what the content of the prosecution's case was and then made moves last week to make prosecutors aware of her meeting with Mr Burrell and this was confirmed today. Mr Burrel, it appears, did not mention his conversation with the Queen because he was anxious it would compromise some form of royal protocol. Outside court, his solicitor said that: \"It is to his utmost credit and typical of the man that it was only this week that he instructed his lawyers as to the full terms of the conversation.\" A source close to Mr Burrell told PA news: \"Paul is extremely loyal to the Queen and he retained some information because of his loyalty ... he didn't want to tell anyone the details of a private conversation he had had with the Queen.\" Rosa Monckton, a friend of the late princess, told Sky News: \"Paul is very discreet ... that's why he was so good at his job, he was the ultimately discreet person.\" Buckingham Palace today denied that the case had been halted at the Queen's request; a spokesman said: \"Absolutely not. There is no question of the Queen interfering in due legal process.\" Questioned whether the prosecution was dropped because of the possibility that the Queen could now be called as a witness, the spokesman said: \"The case was dropped because the prosecution realised their position was no longer viable.\" Again speaking outside court after the dramatic developments, Mr Burrell's solicitor said that when interviewed on 16 August 2001 by the police his client referred to a private audience granted to him by the Queen. The solicitor said: \"It's surprising that no inquiries were made of the Queen in relation to that meeting.\" He went on to criticise the police, saying the \"The evidence in the trial has shown up many mistakes on the part of the police ... indeed, after little time for reflection, they charged him on that day.\" However, inside court, as prosecuting counsel William Boyce QC announced the crown's decision to offer no evidence against Paul Burrell, he said: \"He [Burrell] does refer in those documents [the interview of 16 August] to a private meeting with the Queen but he does not suggest that he informed her majesty that he was holding property for safekeeping. \"As a result, neither the police nor the prosecution asked the Queen about this private meeting with Mr Burrell.\" Mr Boyce adds that the prosecution considered that there was no reason to speak to the Queen. He said: \"I am informed that because the Queen's personal property was not involved and because of concerns to avoid any suggestion that Buckingham palace was trying to interfere with the investigation of this case, the Queen was not briefed on the way in which the case against Mr Burrell was being prepared. \"Therefore her majesty had no means of knowing until after the trial had started of the relevance to the prosecution of the fact that Mr Burrell had mentioned to Her Majesty that he had taken items for safe keeping.\" However, another Labour MP, Paul Flynn of Newport West, was not convinced by the ostensible reasons for the case's collapse and had more of a conspiracy theory take on the matter. Mr Flynn said the developments \"leave us with more questions than answers\". He said: \"The explanation offered is not plausible. The most likely reason is that when Paul Burrell came to give evidence he was going to provide extremely damaging new information which would be damaging to the royal family.\" He added: \"If the explanation given was really the case, why was not the trial halted three weeks ago? It must have been clear to the Queen because she is known to have been an enthusiastic reader of newspapers and the trial should therefore have been halted on day one.\" It is understood that Mr Burrell and the executors of Diana's estate are now likely to discuss whether any items will be returned to the Princess's estate. Asked about the 310 items at the centre of the case, Mr Burrell's solicitor said: \"I think we'll sort it out pretty quickly.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
