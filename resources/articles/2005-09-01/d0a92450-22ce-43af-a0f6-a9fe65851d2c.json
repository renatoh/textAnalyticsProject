The Dusseldorf-based company already ranks as Britain's second biggest gas and electricity supplier through its Powergen subsidiary and is also the UK's second largest electricity generator. In a brief announcement the German group said: \"E.ON confirms that it is considering its options regarding a possible takeover offer for ScottishPower.\" It said it had not approached ScottishPower about an offer but that if a bid was made it \"is likely to be solely in cash\". No one was immediately available at ScottishPower to respond to the E.ON statement, which came after the stock market closed. E.ON said that it had noted the recent rise in the ScottishPower share price, which hit a four-year high last week. It said it considered the price \"represents a substantial element of bid speculation\". Germany's RWE, which owns npower in the UK, and Scottish and Southern Energy have also been tipped as possible bidders. E.ON said last night: \"No approach has been made to the board of Scottish Power and there can be no assurance that a transaction will be forthcoming.\" ScottishPower, which has invested heavily in windfarms in the UK and the US, has been seen as a possible takeover target following its agreement to sell its Pacificorp business in the US to MidAmerica, a subsidiary of Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway in a deal which is expected to bring in a net $5.1bn (\u00a32.8bn). E.ON is one of Europe's largest energy suppliers with a strong presence in its home country of Germany as well as in Holland, Slovakia, the Czech republic and Scandinavia. It also owns an electricity and gas utility in the US. In the UK, besides Powergen it owns Central Networks, which distributes electricity to almost five million customers through Midlands Electicity and East Midlands Electricity. E.ON has 8.5 million domestic and small business customers in the UK. A combination with ScottishPower, which has some five million domestic UK customers, could attract interest from the competition authorities. A takeover would also increase the grip of foreign owned companies on Britain's utilities market where E.ON and RWE are already leading players alongside France's EDF, which is soon to be privatised. Last year, ScottishPower made a profit of almost \u00a3600m and the company has made a strong start to the current financial year, reporting a 41% surge in pre-tax profits to \u00a3147m in the first quarter. Richard Hunter, head of UK equities at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, said much of the premium that E.ON would have to pay to gain control of its potential target was probably already factored into the ScottishPower share price. \"The fact that it has progressed to a public statement means that we also have to assume that competition issues have already been looked at,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
