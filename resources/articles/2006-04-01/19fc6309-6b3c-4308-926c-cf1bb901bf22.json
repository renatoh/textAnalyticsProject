There are now five Hollywood projects about Iraq, driven by A-list names like such as Ridley Scott and Samuel L Jackson. To date, just one American film, highly praised and publicised in the States has been released that deals directly with the current conflict. Joe Dante's Homecoming is controversial and nakedly critical. It manages to weave criticism of the war with Guant\u00e1namo Bay, federal election fraud, evangelical power and the media propagandisation of the conflict. But it's no combat epic - it's a made-for-TV zombie B-movie. It starts during a presidential election debate. As a Republican assures the mother of a fallen soldier: 'If I had one wish ... I would wish for your son to come back', legions of dead soldiers burst out of flag-draped coffins. At first they're welcomed as heroes. But after they announce that they intend to vote out an evil president who sent them to war sold on 'horseshit and elbow-grease', they're branded traitors, put in orange boilersuits and incarcerated in a Guant\u00e1namo-style prison camp. Dante became instantly notorious when Homecoming was released, and was frank about his role in tackling the war. 'It's fucking sick,' he said. 'This pitiful zombie movie is the only thing anybody's done about this issue that's killed 2,000 Americans and untold numbers of Iraqis.' Now that the blue-chip elite are waking up to the possibilities, Dante's wish will be granted. But it remains to be seen whether bigger films have the same incisiveness, passion and wit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
