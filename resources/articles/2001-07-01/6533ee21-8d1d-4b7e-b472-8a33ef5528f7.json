As the quartet eased into the familiar groove of Chameleon (from Head Hunters), a fan, transfixed by Mason's hands and feet, suddenly cried out: \"So that's how he does it.\" But funk is only one facet of their repertoire. Though Mason is a jazz-funk innovator, he has studied all the great improvising drummers, from Art Taylor to Elvin Jones and Tony Williams, and can invoke their spirit at the flick of a stick. Mason plays a couple of solos, but he's at his best in a group; he's a sensitive and responsive musical partner who organises each drum part like an arranger or composer. His band is a classic quartet line-up, with pianist John Beasley, bassist Dave Carpenter and Bennie Maupin on saxes and bass clarinet.The first track, Soular Plexus, had an openness that invites free and inventive playing, punctuated by brief theme statements from Maupin's soprano. Bebop Sally had a sneaky groove over a double-bass riff, bursting into full-on \"jazz time\" playing for the bridge. Midnight Stroll, a composition Mason originally wrote for Fourplay (the smooth jazz \"supergroup\" he helped found) was turned inside out, with Beasley's echoplexed keyboards adding more adventurous flavours to the attractive tune. Maupin's Message to Prez was a highlight of the evening, though the quiet opening bass-clarinet solo was almost drowned out by bad-mannered diners. When serious listeners shushed noisy eaters to silence, Maupin paused to say thank you before resuming the ostinato, soon joined by bass and an understated groove. Maupin, who has played with Roy Haynes, McCoy Tyner, Miles Davis and several Herbie Hancock groups, is the elder statesman of this band. He has a modest on-stage demeanour that belies the intensity of his solo playing, which is steeped in the jazz tradition, however funky or free the context. Mason always produces beautiful tone colours from his cymbals and toms, often playing a kind of melodic counterpoint to the others. Yet at full tilt, as on the John Coltrane-ish tenor/ drums dialogue over the asymmetric riff of Beyond the Shadow, he's just awesome. The ecstatic audience (surely they can't all be drummers?) demanded an encore, a gutsy version of Four."}, "isHosted": false}}}
