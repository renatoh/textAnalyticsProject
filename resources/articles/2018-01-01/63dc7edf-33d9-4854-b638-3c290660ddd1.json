After accounting for West Ham and Bournemouth already, there seems little chance of Wigan being daunted by any opponents. \u201cThere is no fear,\u201d said Will Grigg, scorer of both goals against David Moyes\u2019s depleted side. \u201cWe have got some really good quality players here, players who shouldn\u2019t necessarily be in League One, that\u2019s why our main aim this season is promotion. We get the ball down and we pass it, it doesn\u2019t matter who the opponents are. That\u2019s been our plan from the start of the season and it is working so well we are confident of playing anyone. \u201cWe are quite familiar with Premier League opposition now, most of us have experience from cup meetings and you can see the players\u2019 confidence is high. Obviously that helps but we are also playing some really good football. We don\u2019t have the players to play a long-ball game, so we don\u2019t do that. We use the wide areas and put crosses into the box and it\u2019s flowing at the moment. We create a lot of chances and I just do the easy job of putting it in the net at the end.\u201d While Grigg\u2019s second goal was a penalty his opener after seven minutes was in fact far from easy. He was helped by the most inviting of crosses from the outstanding Nathan Byrne but there still remained the small matter of heading powerfully and accurately enough to squeeze the ball past Joe Hart at the far post. He made typically short work of it and once ahead Wigan never looked like losing their lead, though they were undoubtedly helped by Arthur Masuaku\u2019s dismissal early in the second half for spitting at Nick Powell. \u201cHe\u2019s been a really good boy up till now, I don\u2019t know why he lost it like that,\u201d Moyes said. \u201cI can\u2019t defend it, it should never have happened. He deserves whatever is coming to him but we are in a position at the moment where we can\u2019t afford to lose any more players.\u201d With Pedro Obiang departing on a stretcher in the first half with suspected medial ligament damage West Ham\u2019s trip to Wigan was costly for a side already lacking seven or eight first-team regulars. Moyes is hoping to have one or two back for the crucial league games against Crystal Palace and Brighton this week, though he is not hopeful of bringing anyone in before Wednesday and it appears likely West Ham will be under-strength in two of the games that could be key to Premier League survival. \u201cWe are not too bad for defenders but we are struggling with midfield and forward options,\u201d Moyes said. \u201cYou could see that against Wigan. If we didn\u2019t look like a Premier League team it was because we only had a smattering of Premier League players. The rest were young lads on their way up.\u201d Cook has plenty of those too, as well as established performers such as Grigg and Powell, yet though some supporters are worried about bids before the end of the transfer window the Wigan manager is surprisingly relaxed about the situation. \u201cIf you are playing like we are you are bound to attract interest,\u201d Cook said. \u201cThat\u2019s life. As a group we are happy, but if someone has to leave I wish them well. \u201cLads at this level can change their lives by moving upwards. As a manager you can\u2019t stop them, you just have to concentrate on working with the players who want to be with you. We are on a good run at the minute but anyone who knows football knows that can change in a moment. Just look at Liverpool.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
