For the Taiwan-based HTC makes a huge range of Windows Mobile devices including T-Mobile's MDA Vario II, possibly the best smartphone around. The Windows Mobile-based S310 not only has the HTC logo, it is designed to be sold Sim-free - so it can work with any network provider. Sadly, the S310 won't do much to further the HTC brand. It is a standard chocolate bar-style smartphone that has the basics (Outlook, Explorer, Media Player etc) but lacks pizzazz. Up against recent rivals like the MDA Vario and Nokia N73, it really does look dated. The poor quality 1.3 megapixel camera, limited storage space and poor curved keys don't help either. Worst of all is the screen, which is nowhere near as bright as its rivals. Battery life is also poor. So unless buying a Sim-free phone is your number one priority, I'd pass on this."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
