But now he fancies the scrum-half position, which shows his union instincts are sharply honed now. His defensive work was also exemplary. He made one superb tackle, running a much larger opponent at least five yards into touch. And he proved that height isn't everything by chasing a kick and leaping above everyone else to claim it. Dan Luger's injury was a blow to the team and certainly hung over the build-up to this game. Robinson's performance has mended much of the damage. Every time he receives the ball, the crowd - even the partisan locals - now expect something electric to happen. Everybody on the Lions team expects something to happen, and the instincts of the players inside him are now to give him as much to do as possible."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
