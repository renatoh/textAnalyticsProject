There is something metaphorical about the backup catcher who loves the sport so much he walked the aisle in the batter\u2019s box, as the Washington Nationals\u2019 Jos\u00e9 Lobat\u00f3n once did years ago when he played in Tampa Bay. That\u2019s the passion that carries you on through years of sitting on the bench, playing on Sunday afternoons and the odd weeknight when the regular catcher needs a rest. The money is decent but not outlandish, the disappointments are many. But then, at 31 years old, there comes a playoff like this National League Division Series, and an injury to the team\u2019s star catcher, Wilson Ramos, and suddenly everything turns to the backup catcher who much of baseball forgot, batting eighth where he can do the least damage. Nobody expects anything. They just hope he doesn\u2019t screw things up. By the fourth inning of Sunday\u2019s game two of the NLDS, Lobat\u00f3n had indeed screwed up. He grounded into a bases- loaded double play in the second, and then dropped a throw from right fielder Bryce Harper that would have caught the Dodgers\u2019 Justin Turner at the plate. With the Nats already down 2-0 in a series where they were about to go down 0-2, he felt pretty low indeed. Still, as a baseball lifer, he\u2019s been around long enough to know that things can change. This is the thing he\u2019s been trying to tell himself for years, the flaw he\u2019s worked hard to correct: don\u2019t dwell on the momentary failures \u2013 there will always be another chance. And so in the fourth, just one inning after the dropped throw from Harper, there came that chance. The Nationals had two men on base with two outs, and Dodgers pitcher Rich Hill tried to flick a curveball about chest-high, and Lobat\u00f3n swung with all his might. The ball rose high into afternoon sun toward the left field fence. It climbed through a stiff wind that howled at around 20mph for much of the day. It cut through the gale in a way none of the other players imagined a ball could on Sunday. The Dodgers\u2019 left fielder Andrew Toles first waited for the ball to die in the gusts, then realized it wouldn\u2019t. He got to the fence, prepared to jump, then didn\u2019t. The ball carried far over his head for a three-run home run. Just like that, the lifetime backup from Venezuela who was only playing because the regular catcher was hurt, had hit the biggest home run of the Nationals\u2019 postseason. Instead of being down 2-0 and about to go down 0-2 in a five-game series, Washington was ahead 3-2 and had life. \u201cWe needed that,\u201d Nats outfielder Jayson Werth later said. What a feeling it must have been for Lobat\u00f3n to circle the bases the way he did on Sunday, with 43,826 people cheering as he ran. After he touched home plate and was mobbed by his teammates he trotted to the dugout where the fans would not let him sit. They clapped and roared until he finally ran back up the steps and waved in return. How funny baseball is this way. One moment you are despondent over a double play and a dropped throw, the next you are waving to a sold-out crowd over a home run that changed the series. Washington went on to win 5-2 and now flies to Los Angeles tied 1-1 with the Dodgers. Lobat\u00f3n came back to the clubhouse, where he sat before the anonymous locker beside that of Harper, the team\u2019s star. He changed out of his uniform and into gym shorts and leggings, pulling on stars and stripes socks over the leggings. He laughed a lot at the idea of being the team\u2019s most important player in the most important game. \u201cI think everybody [is] going to feel great now,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we want, do something good for the team so the team can get that little push that we need. And hopefully we did hat today.\u201d He wondered if maybe he had hit the ball at an instant when the wind wasn\u2019t blowing as hard but it seemed like the wind was whipping between the buildings behind the left field stands really stiff all day. Sometimes great things happen if you forget about the bad ones. Everything in this game he loves is about living for the next moment regardless of what happens. Later, his team-mate Daniel Murphy, the Nats\u2019 second baseman, looked at the switch-hitting Lobat\u00f3n, who usually hits left, and asked: \u201cWhen is the last time you hit right-handed in a game?\u201d \u201cAbout a month and a half,\u201d Lobat\u00f3n replied. \u201cThat\u2019s just professional right there,\u201d Murphy said. Lobat\u00f3n has had another moment like Sunday\u2019s. It came three years ago in Tampa, when he hit a ninth-inning home run to beat the Red Sox in game three of the ALDS. He hit it into the 10,000-gallon tank filled with swimming rays that is located behind Tropicana Field\u2019s center field fence. That was the year after he was married at home plate before a July home game. Now he has a third highlight in a baseball life that has otherwise been an anonymous grind. He saved the Nats on Sunday. And here in Washington, they will never forget the windy day the forgotten catcher gave them an unforgettable afternoon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
