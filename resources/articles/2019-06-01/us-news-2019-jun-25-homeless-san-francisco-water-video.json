The footage, which spread on social media this week, showed someone standing on a roof of a two-story building and throwing water on a person and their belongings on the street directly below. One witness told the Guardian it was clear the dousing on Sunday afternoon was intentional, and another local resident said he had witnessed a similar dumping incident targeting a homeless person on the same street a week prior. \u201cIt was an attack,\u201d said Richard Alexander Caraballo, who saw the incident from the window of an apartment across the street. \u201cHe just came out of nowhere \u2026 It was upsetting to see that happen as if it was his right to do that.\u201d The woman was standing with a shopping cart and other belongings when a man from above dumped a large bucket of water directly on her, said Caraballo, a 44-year-old graphic designer visiting from New York. He said that he initially thought it could have been an accident, but that the man then dumped a second bucket of water on to her things as she was trying to move her belongings. \u201cIt was a direct hit \u2026 It seems like he\u2019s really dead set on attacking people,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he can do that, what\u2019s next? Rocks?\u201d The video shared on Twitter, first reported by NBC Bay Area, captured the second round of dumping, he said. Brett Leader, who works in the building in the city\u2019s Mission district where the video was shot, said he had seen an almost identical incident earlier this month. He was standing a few feet away when a bucket of water came pouring down on to a homeless person who was under a tarp on the street. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t an accident or coincidence. This was premeditated,\u201d said Leader, who also lives in the area. \u201cIt just seemed so aggressive and immoral \u2026 It\u2019s just not something you should do to anyone, regardless of whether they are homeless.\u201d He said the individual had moved around under the tarp but had not gotten up: \u201cIt definitely soaked everything.\u201d Neither of the people in the video have been identified. A San Francisco police spokesperson said authorities were \u201caware of the incident\u201d but that no victim had come forward to file a complaint. The case follows a number of similar incidents in recent years in San Francisco and the surrounding northern California cities, which have struggled with a huge homeless crisis and housing shortage as the tech industry has boomed in the region. Authorities released shocking video last year of a man in a suit kicking someone lying on the sidewalk in San Francisco, in an unprovoked attack. In Oakland, across the bay, a jogger was caught on camera grabbing a homeless man\u2019s belongings and throwing them into a lake. St Mary\u2019s Cathedral, home of the Catholic archbishop of San Francisco, faced international backlash in 2015 after it installed water sprinklers above its doorways that were dousing homeless people seeking shelter there. A luxury fine arts and antiques auction faced similar criticism the following year after homeless people spoke out about the auctioneer using a sprinkler system to douse their belongings and prevent them from camping. \u201cThis incident is indicative of the extreme level of class hatred against poor folks in San Francisco, especially hatred against unhoused residents,\u201d said Leslie Dreyer, a local artist and organizer. She works with the Coalition on Homelessness on the Stolen Belonging project, which has been documenting raids on homeless people and incidents of the city and others trashing the belongings of people camped on the streets. \u201cIt\u2019s just awful \u2026 There is so much hatred toward them, and they know it.\u201d A group of San Francisco residents in a wealthy neighborhood recently raised funds for a lawsuit to try and block a new homeless shelter from opening in the area. Caraballo said the person who had dumped the water appeared to be an older white man with some gray hair and that his demeanor when he was pouring the water was disturbing: \u201cThis guy was just so calm \u2026 He was so cold about it.\u201d The woman, who was drenched, dried her belongings in the sun and set up a tent on the street that night, he added: \u201cShe could get sick, doesn\u2019t he realize?\u201d A recent federal count showed vast increases of homeless people across the Bay Area, including a 20% surge in the number of unsheltered people in San Francisco, to nearly 5,200 total. The city has one of the highest concentrations of billionaires in the world. In addition to city sweeps, businesses, private security officers and other residents also regularly bother people living on the streets, making it impossible for them to sleep or maintain their possessions, said Dreyer: \u201cIt has a mental health toll on people \u2026 It\u2019s just horrible.\u201d Leader, who has lived in the city for 10 years, said he hoped the individual was caught and that this never happened again: \u201cIt\u2019s important that folks are made aware that this is happening and it\u2019s not OK.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
