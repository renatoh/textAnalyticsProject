Roll-up! Please form an orderly queue for the newly vacant position of finance director of Wm Morrison. Dream on, chairman Sir Ken and newly-elevated chief executive Bob Stott. There are more attractive positions for would-be chief bean-counters. Sir Ken is notoriously parsimonious and doesn't go in for fancy remuneration schemes, so anyone with ambitions for the sort of Sainsbury-style package that has the potential to turn its new FD, Darren Shapland, into a six million pound man, need not apply. It is reward enough to work for Yorkshire's greatest company. So Morrisons directors get relatively measly annual salaries - outgoing FD Martin Ackroyd got a basic \u00a3330,000 last year - and plain vanilla share options. There's also the little matter of Mr Ackroyd still being in the building. He may be stepping down, but he could also be staying on, in a different sort of capacity, whatever that means. What new FD wants the old one, with 31 years at the ear of the master, still present? Then there's the Ken factor. The man dubbed \"the retailers' retailer\" is an abrasive character who has run the family firm for 53 years and nobody knows more ... or better. Taking over Safeway, he insisted, would be a walk in the park. He strode into the Safeway HQ on day one and wiped out any goodwill or motivation the staff may have had. And as it turns out, integrating Safeway has been a big ask and still is. The Morrisons formula and stores are good - despite what some London-centric commentators say. They are not about forcefeeding Surrey-types with black pudding and meat pies. But Morrisons' small management team has been overstretched. Two profits warnings later and Ken shows no sign of changing his style. One analyst attending yesterday's briefing described his demeanour as \"bizarre, abrasive and truculent\" - not a day devoted to winning back friends then. The encouraging news is that the Safeway stores that Morrisons has converted are performing well and those still under the Safeway fascia seem to be halting their decline. The core Morrisons are looking a bit sick, but no worse than analysts expected. All Sir Ken needs now is a good FD. Now where was that queue? Energy woes For three decades Britain's energy policy has been a two word affair: North Sea. Supply problem? Open the taps. Now that self sufficiency is past, the government is seeking alternatives. Yesterday the Commons trade and industry committee and its chairman, Martin O'Neill, castigated the Department of Trade for putting its faith in the market to ensure supplies. Industry had been slower than the DTI had expected to deliver extra supply and storage capacity. Though there was no evidence of collusion or other attempts at manipulation, the market was not working as it should. Among the market imperfections: a lack of transparency and the reluctance of German and French monopolies to accept real liberalisation of the European market on which Britain is increasingly reliant. Longer term the market will remain imperfect. Europe will remain sticky for a while. Transparency is easier to demand than deliver. More broadly, wind and wave will expand the energy mix. Energy saving has much to contribute. But with coal-fired generation running into the Large Combustion Plant Direc tive, and carbon targets likely to tighten the government will not be able to duck the nuclear issue for much longer. A fifth of Britain's energy comes from ageing nuclear plant. Industry needs to know how that will be replaced. In energy, the market responds to policy, it doesn't replace it. Rules are rules At the risk of trying readers' patience, we must return to the vexed issue of City regulation. The trigger, this time, is the \u00a335,000 fine handed down to spread betting specialist City Index by the Financial Services Authority. The firm had not been making it clear enough in its advertising that punters who enter into a spread bet on a financial asset can lose more than their original stake. Back in the autumn the FSA called all the spread betting firms to a meeting at which they were read the riot act over the way in which they were promoting themselves. According to several of those present, the FSA's central case was that the \"shotgun\" manner of the spread betters' advertising - aimed at the public at large - risked attracting people who were not necessarily suitable spread betting clients. The firms complained that this was unreasonable. If they took out a banner ad on FT.Com, for example, how could they be held responsible for a 12-year-old clicking on the site? And in any case, the firms argued, the point at which they checked whether a client was a suitable spread better was at the point of registration, when anyone making a spread bet has to sign (FSA-inspired) forms. No matter, the FSA said. Rules are rules and these say the nature of the product - and all the attendant risks - have to be explained as part of the advertisement. Small print rules and, by extension, our financial regulators believe the public reads it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
