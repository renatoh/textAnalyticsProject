I do not. As this paper reported at the beginning of the year, I am opposed to what I called \u201cpassengers\u201d in the Lords who make no or very little contribution. They are a minority, but they undo much of the good work done by the vast majority. In the past 12 months the House of Lords has made almost 2,300 changes to improve legislation; apart from daily oral questions, peers have tabled more than 8,000 written questions and taken part in more than 160 debates; while well over 300 peers have been active members of select committees which have published more than 150 reports on subjects ranging from tuition fees to intergenerational fairness. Those who argue for the abolition of the second chamber, as Owen Jones did last week, need to say how this work would be done. It is not enough just to propose more powers for the Commons in a unicameral system \u2013 this would do little to improve levels of scrutiny when a government is returned with a big majority. In those circumstances, having a second chamber to ensure legislation does not slip through without proper debate and analysis is absolutely essential. Proponents of abolition or complete reform also need to explain how the legislation necessary to radically change the Lords will get through parliament at a time when Brexit dominates the legislative agenda. It is politically naive to believe that any government, in present circumstances, would embark on such a course. The Lords itself \u2013 not the government \u2013 has agreed to take action to reduce numbers following the report of the committee I set up under the chairmanship of Terry Burns. We want to see the total size of the House capped at 600 and fixed terms for new members. Since the Burns report was published there have been almost 70 departures from the House but there is clearly more to do. As we await the result of the Conservative leadership election and the new prime minister we want to see the policy of Theresa May, exercising restraint in appointing new members to the Lords, continued by her successors. Responding to the Burns report, she said: \u201cI intend to continue with the restraint which I have exercised to date and, when making appointments, to allocate them fairly, bearing in mind the results of the last general election and the leadership shown by each party in terms of retirements.\u201d That is the first time a prime minister has made such a commitment. It is in stark contrast to the policy of Tony Blair who appointed 374 new peers and David Cameron who appointed a further 245. To date, May has appointed 42 new life peers but the resignation honours list beckons. It is at this point that prime ministers are tempted to reward rather than ask what contribution a person under consideration can make. I very much hope that May will continue to follow her excellent policy of moderation. There has been concern over the work of sitting Lords. Both Conservative and Labour governments have confirmed that members should be allowed to take up part-time jobs, it would be extraordinary in a non-salaried House for it to be otherwise. The rules clearly prohibit peers acting as paid lobbyists and also require public disclosure of sources of income. We have now set up a new conduct committee under the chairmanship of Lord Mance, a former deputy president of the supreme court. They keep the code of conduct under review and can propose any changes which are necessary. The Guardian survey of participation underlines one further step that we should now consider. Many life peers come to the Lords without much idea of the contribution they are expected to make. I remember one peer who had just been sworn in coming to me to say they had made a mistake and had not realised the work that was involved. We could set up a system, as is already the case for those who apply to be a crossbench peer, where the House of Lords appointments commission questions each new candidate on the contribution that he or she would make if their appointment was confirmed. My belief is that a policy of reducing numbers and checking new candidates are prepared to make the contribution that most peers already make would go a very long way to eliminating the passengers. I should also add it is already the case that every member must make a declaration that they have undertaken parliamentary work when they claim the daily allowance. If there is any question, the independent commissioner for standards can investigate. Of course, I recognise the policy I have set out will not satisfy those who want, for example, to elect the second chamber, but perhaps they might understand such a move is currently politically impractical. However, progress to make the Lords smaller with all members making a sensible contribution is within our grasp. \u2022 Norman Fowler is Lord Speaker and was a cabinet minister with Margaret Thatcher for 11 years"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
