On January 31 2006 Cpl Pritchard became the 100th member of the British armed forces to die since the Iraq war began. Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA To cynics, Tony Blair's Christmas trip to meet troops in southern Iraq was little more than a photo opportunity. To supporters, it was proof that he cared enough to thank the soldiers personally for their hard work, writes Tania Branigan. The snapshot of the prime minister meeting Corporal Gordon Pritchard - whose death this week raised the toll on the armed forces in Iraq to 100 dead since the war began - could be seized as evidence by either side. Though anti-war campaigners will no doubt seek to exploit the picture, Cpl Pritchard was happy to meet and chat to Mr Blair on his whistle-stop tour. The 31-year-old was one of a few dozen servicemen who spoke to the prime minister in person. Mr Blair spent only four hours in the country, much of that in transit to the Shaibah logistics base, close to Basra, where around 4,000 British troops from the 9th and 12th Lancers, the Royal Irish Regiment and Royal Regiment of Fusiliers are based. While squaddies seemed underawed by his presence, with one complaining he would have preferred another visit from comedian Jim Davidson, there was little of the muttering that had greeted the prime minister the previous year. Many of them had served in Iraq before. There was no outrage at their return; simply a professional acceptance that this was their job. Nor was there great optimism at Mr Blair's hint that a phased withdrawal of British troops could begin within six months. \"We're here for as long as we need to be,\" one squaddy said with a shrug. Another praised the improving capability of the Iraqi police and army, but pointed out that it was no longer safe for troops to patrol on foot, in soft berets, as they had done in the war's immediate aftermath. Cpl Pritchard's death yesterday - he was killed when his Land Rover was hit by a roadside bomb - is further evidence of that deterioration. \"I want to say thank you for all that you are doing. I know how dangerous it is,\" Mr Blair told him and his colleagues just before Christmas. \"You have lost good colleagues here. It is difficult in this situation. But the one thing for sure is that when you look back on this time you can be very proud of what you have done. \"Whatever the controversies there are about the politics of this situation, people back home have enormous pride in our armed forces.\" * Tania Branigan reported from Basra on Tony Blair's trip in December"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
