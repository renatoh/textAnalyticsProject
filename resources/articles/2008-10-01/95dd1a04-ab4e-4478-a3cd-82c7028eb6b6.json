In the 18th century, it was the mines and the manufacturing industries. Today, it is the university. So said Sir Ron Dearing, the life peer and ex-chancellor of Nottingham University, in May. And many in higher education will tell you this is true. Universities, they say, lie at the core of our cities. They are often the largest employer, the business with the biggest turnover and a, if not the, key player in the city's civic culture, development and reputation. Universities UK, the umbrella group for vice-chancellors, says higher education now generates more money than the aircraft and transport sectors put together. Prof Kel Fidler, former vice-chancellor of Northumbria University, says he has heard the joint turnover of his university and the University of Newcastle (\u00a30.5bn) is greater in today's money than the turnover was of the shipyards in the heyday of the Tyne, when Newcastle was one of the world's most important shipbuilding centres. The two universities employ almost 4% of the city's estimated 190,000 citizens with, between them, up to 7,000 staff. One in every seven inhabitants is part of the universities or Newcastle College. The former vice-chancellor of Southampton Solent University, Prof Roger Brown, says in 2000, his former university and the University of Southampton together generated \u00a3300m out of an estimated \u00a34.2bn that the city annually contributes to its regional economy. But it's not all about money. Queen Mary, University of London, has had a major influence on the regeneration of Mile End, where its main campus is located. The University of Cumbria, which has campuses in, among other places, the cities of Carlisle and Lancaster, was formed last year to serve \"the needs of a widely dispersed rural and urban community across a wide geographical area\". Prof Chris Carr, vice-chancellor of Cumbria, says: \"We see the new university lying at the heart of the community. In turn and in time, I would want the community to see the university at its centre.\" It's not just universities, however; schools, housing associations and community centres are also at the heart of cities, says Ty Goddard, director of the British Council for School Environments. \"Universities certainly have a key role in cities, but so do other institutions,\" he says. Let's not forget the downside to having a university at the centre of a city. Where there's a campus, there are also students living nearby and unscrupulous landlords waiting to exploit them. Quickly, areas around a campus can degenerate into dingy student ghettos. Locals are pushed out to make way for term-time-only students, who sometimes misbehave on the street and live in homes that nurses and teachers need. A spokesman from the Design Commission for Wales, who does not want to be named, says developers \"get away with high-rise student housing which can blight a city\". Perhaps one of the best indicators of how central a university is to its city is how many of its graduates stay to live there. A study last year found that of 600 final-year undergraduates and postgraduates at the University of Sussex, 40% planned to stay. Which goes to show that a student's relationship with the city in which they live and study doesn't simply end with the degree course. \u2022 We originally described Kel Fidler as the vice-chancellor of Northumbria University but understand he has since changed jobs and is now former vice-chancellor"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
