The Aviva Stadium will be chilly and raucous, the Irish pack will be fired up and the contest both on the floor and in the air will be ferocious. Any similarities with the quiet, sunny and mellow Algarve where England are preparing are not immediately obvious. Of course there are benefits to be had from training in warmer temperatures \u2013 it was a pleasant 18C in the Algarve on Monday \u2013 but England\u2019s modern history is littered with examples of being caught cold by highly motivated Celts away from Twickenham. Almost eight years have passed since their last Six Nations try in Dublin, a consolation effort from the hooker Steve Thompson in a 25-8 defeat during the Martin Johnson era. England, in fact, have won only once in Dublin since Johnson led England to their grand slam\u2011clinching victory there in 2003. Since the Five Nations became Six in 2000 every team trailing at half-time in this fixture on Irish soil has subsequently lost the match, a statistic clearly exercising the minds of England\u2019s management. \u201cThis is going to be a brutal Test match and you\u2019ve got to get in first,\u201d said John Mitchell, the former All Black head coach now in charge of England\u2019s pack. \u201cI\u2019ve always said to friends that it is a very emotive tournament. We are representing a nation that is not well liked by other countries so that adds its own little spice. We have got to walk towards that challenge and embrace it.\u201d Mitchell knows more than a little about this particular subject, having also coached Ireland\u2019s forwards back in the distant days of Murray Kidd\u2019s stewardship. These days the Irish pack is as tough as anyone\u2019s, not least at the breakdown where England have suffered in the past. While highly respectful of the opposition\u2019s capacity for hard work \u2013 \u201cThey come again and again and again\u201d \u2013 Mitchell has also suggested the home team \u201cwill look to bore the shit out of us\u201d tactically. \u201cUltimately it will come down to a small piece of possession; when you\u2019re not focused that can hurt you in a contest like this.\u201d The visitors, consequently, will have to be tooled up physically and mentally braced. Walking towards the challenge might not be enough; England\u2019s back row will need rather more in the way of forward momentum. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to come out of the blocks quick,\u201d said Northampton\u2019s Courtney Lawes, aware of the noise that will wash over England should they start sluggishly and allow Ireland to take an early lead. \u201cEspecially in such a stadium with such passionate fans, you definitely need to come out firing and set the tone for the game. They\u2019re a great team on very good form, so it\u2019s a big challenge for us but I\u2019m 100% sure we\u2019re ready for it.\u201d With England not due to confirm their XV until Thursday it remains to be seen what role Lawes will end up playing. With Brad Shields not having played lately because of a side strain and Jack Clifford having returned home after sustaining a bang to the head during training, it would be little surprise to see a starting back row of Tom Curry at openside, Billy Vunipola at number eight and Newcastle\u2019s Mark Wilson, one of the success stories of the autumn Tests, on the blindside flank. If so, Wilson would be required to get the better of the Munster captain Peter O\u2019Mahony, among others, having never previously sampled a top-level contest in Ireland. With Curry still only 20 and Vunipola still working his way back to full throttle, much could rest on Wilson\u2019s willing shoulders. \u201cI\u2019ve played a pre-season game in Dublin but I don\u2019t pay too much attention to where I am playing,\u201d the Falcons forward said. \u201cAs soon as you start to take in the occasion and the environment, that\u2019s when people start to lose focus. I imagine it\u2019s a great place to play and people will bang on about the atmosphere but I\u2019ll be very much focused on what goes on on the pitch.\u201d Should Lawes be involved, either as a starter or off the bench, Ireland will also encounter an opponent feeling stronger again now his previously sore back has healed. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do weights for six weeks because of my back and it wasn\u2019t good \u2013 I\u2019d got pretty thin. I\u2019ve put on just over a stone since the autumn but I\u2019m around the right weight now. I don\u2019t really count calories, I just shovel food down my throat.\u201d Such are the realties of modern professional rugby, where getting smaller is not a wise career move. The experienced Ireland wing Keith Earls, for one, is expecting another heavy-duty contest but does not anticipate England bringing anything beyond what is now commonplace at Test level. \u201cEvery game we play in is brutal and physical because it\u2019s 15 men trying to kill another 15 men within the rules of the game,\u201d Earls said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t get too bogged down in it. They are expected to be brutally physical against the Scots, the Italians and the Welsh as well.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
