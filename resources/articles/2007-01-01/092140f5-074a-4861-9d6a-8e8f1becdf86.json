He was the economist who produced a book saying that the world's stock markets were wildly overvalued in the very week that the Nasdaq peaked in early 2000. So when Shiller, a Yale professor, says that governments need to be drawing up plans to tackle inequality - and drawing them up now - he is well worth listening to. The context for Shiller's argument was a discussion in Davos about shifting economic power both between and within countries. The gains of globalisation are not evenly spread out - unskilled workers in poor countries do better than unskilled workers in rich countries; skilled workers in rich countries do better than semi-skilled workers in poor countries. There was, said Shiller, a cosmopolitan class that transcended national boundaries which acted as the cheerleaders for globalisation, because they were doing well out of it, and large numbers of blue-collar and, increasingly, white collar workers fearful of losing their jobs or of having their living standards eroded. Shiller's answer was a somewhat uncomfortable one for the chief executives gathered in Davos; there should be more progressive taxation to distribute the fruits of growth more fairly. This, you don't need to be a genius to work out, is precisely the opposite of what has been happening in recent years, especially in the United States, where tax cuts have been heavily skewed in favour of the rich. Moreover, the trend towards private equity companies has led to the rise of a new breed of entrepreneurs intent on sweating assets to secure greater returns. The result, according to Stephen Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley, is that labour's share of the economic pie is at a historic low and capital's is at a historic high. He sees the swing of the pendulum to the left, not only in the US but also elsewhere, as a sign of growing political discontent. Both Shiller and Roach are right. Historically, high levels of inequality have proved incompatible with democracy: that's why since the start of the industrial revolution we've seen the introduction of measures that knock the rough edges off capitalism such as income tax, the growth of trade unions, welfare states and free education. If globalisation represents a turbo-charged form of capitalism it's hardly surprising that there are anxietes. What is surprising is that governments have been so slow to react. Shiller believes that if policy makers continue to bury their heads in the sand there is going to be an almighty backlash and he is absolutely right."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
