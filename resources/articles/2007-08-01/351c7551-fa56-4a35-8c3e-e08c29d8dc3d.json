It said abatacept, manufactured by Bristol-Myers Squibb under the brand name Orencia, was not cost-effective. The chief executive of the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society, Ailsa Bosworth, said about 12,000 people with an aggressive form of the disease who did not respond to other treatments would be \"condemned to a life of pain and disability, which could be equally expensive to the NHS\". John Carvel British soldier killed in Basra bomb attack A soldier from the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment has been killed in Basra, the Ministry of Defence said yesterday. He died from injuries sustained after an improvised explosive device hit his Warrior armoured vehicle patrol, which the MoD said was carrying out \"routine duties\" in the Mustashfa district of the southern Iraqi city on Tuesday night. The MoD said the soldier's next of kin had been informed of the death and asked for a period of 24 hours before his name is released. 164 British military personnel have now been killed during operations in Iraq since the invasion in March 2003. Richard Norton-Taylor Dawn ceremony marks centenary of scouting One hundred years of scouting was celebrated yesterday on the island where the movement began. Robert Baden-Powell's experience in the army led him to run a camp for 20 boys from different social backgrounds at Brownsea Island in Poole Harbour, Dorset, in August 1907. The island was the focus of celebrations for about 28 million members of the Scout Association worldwide, with 300 scouts attending a commemorative camp on the site used by Baden-Powell. Scouts from more than 160 countries took part in a sunrise ceremony on Brownsea at 8am, the official centenary. Press Association UK to request EU cash to help flood victims The government will apply to an EU disaster relief scheme for cash to help victims of this summer's floods, the communities minister, John Healey, announced last night. The solidarity fund usually pays out up to 5% of the total damage costs to help member states deal with the uninsurable costs of emergencies, such as bills for emergency services and restoring infrastructure. If approved, payments are likely to take between nine and 12 months to filter through. But the shadow environment secretary, Peter Ainsworth, said ministers should have requested cash earlier. Tania Branigan US cosmetics firms using Britons as guinea pigs American companies are using British women as guinea pigs to test controversial anti-wrinkle treatments before they can be licensed for use in the US, the consumers' association Which? warned last night. It said more than 400,000 people a year undergo non-surgical cosmetic treatments that are unregulated in Britain, but tightly controlled in the US, including cosmetic fillers that are injected to plump up the skin. The association's health campaigner, Jenny Driscoll, said: \"If the Department of Health does not step in and recognise the flaws in the system, it is leaving British patients at risk.\" John Carvel \u00a33m illumination plan for city of Durham Durham is planning a \u00a33.14m coordinated outdoor lighting scheme with the aim of beautifying the city, boosting annual visitor numbers beyond the present 3.17m, and \"restoring\" the night sky via downlighting in place of streetlamp glow. Mark Major, of lighting architects Spiers and Major, said: \"People will once again be able to see the stars.\" The 10-year plan, which will give the medieval alleys, or vennels, subdued \"triggered\" lighting, will also highlight neglected city features, such as the striking railway viaduct, with special illuminations. Businesses will be asked to adjust to the plan. Martin Wainwright Dead shark washed up on Cornish beach A dead predatory shark of a type commonly mistaken for a great white has been washed up on a beach in Cornwall, the county's wildlife trust revealed yesterday. The porbeagle shark, which has a similar shape and colouring to a great white but is harmless to humans, was found at Gunwalloe on the Lizard on Saturday. The juvenile fish was about 1.5 metres long - a similar size to the shark filmed by a holidaymaker off St Ives which was claimed to be a great white. Since that footage was shown scores of sightings of sharks have been reported around the south-west coast. Press Association Council allows home for servicemen's families A plan to open a home for the families of servicemen who have lost their limbs fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan was given approval last night in spite of fierce objections from local residents. Owners of multimillion pound homes in Ashtead, Surrey, claimed that the presence in their street of the relatives of the wounded being treated at nearby Headley Court rehabilitation centre would cause increased traffic and pose a terror threat. Members of the development control committee of Mole Valley district council voted 17-1 to allow a six-bedroom house to be converted to cater for servicemen's families.
