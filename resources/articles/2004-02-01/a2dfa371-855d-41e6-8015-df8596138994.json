Les Bleus' 14th successive victory was an ideal start to the centenary year of their national team. Manchester United's new acquisition from Fulham thus marked yet another debut with a goal which may quell speculation about a recall for Manchester City's Nicolas Anelka. France barely missed their injured first-choice strikers, Thierry Henry and David Trezeguet, to take the lead almost on half-time. Belgium's goalkeeper Gert de Vlieger failed to hold Saha's shot and Sidney Govou scored easily. Saha doubled the advantage 15 minutes from time on an assist from Zinedine Zidane. \"I'm happy for Louis,\" said Zidane. \"First game, first goal - that's nice.\" France, who have not conceded a goal since a 3-2 win over Turkey in the Confederations Cup last June, were the only one of England's Euro 2004 rivals to win last night. Croatia lost 2-1 to Germany and Switzerland fell by the same margin in Morocco. Croatia were beaten in the last minute in Split by a long-range goal from the German substitute Carsten Ramelow whose effort was deflected past the goalkeeper Stipe Pletikosa off the midfielder Jerko Leko. Croatia had looked insecure in defence in the first half and Germany took advantage on 34 minutes when Miroslav Klose converted a pass from Kevin Kuranyi. The Croats exerted heavy second-half pressure but were not rewarded until six minutes from time when Mato Neretljak headed the equaliser. Ramelow then claimed his late goal as Germany stole their first away win since a 5-2 victory over Hungary in Budapest in August 2001. Morocco defeated Switzerland in Rabat despite resting the entire first team who finished runners-up to hosts Tunisia last weekend in the African Nations Cup. Moroccan forward Nabil Mesloub twice forced good saves from the goalkeeper George Stiel before they broke through when Switzerland failed to clear a corner and Ajeddou struck a low angled left-foot shot past the goalkeeper on 75 minutes. Two minutes later Iajour scored the Moroccan second. Switzerland saved a little pride with a last-minute consolation strike from Alexander Frei."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
