They were at the ground on Monday night to hear his impassioned one-man performance of one of the Welsh game\u2019s most lauded figures, the late Ray Gravell. Not the Wales and Real Madrid footballer Gareth Bale, but an actor of the same name who has taken Grav, Owen Thomas\u2019s play on the Llanelli and Lions centre, around the country for the last four years. Most of the Wales squad and management watched the performance in the dressing room England will change in this weekend. \u201cIt was a fantastic experience,\u201d said the Wales forwards coach, Robin McBryde. \u201cIt put us in a really good place mentally wise and we should have played straight after it. If we can in any way match Gareth Bale\u2019s performance on Saturday, it does not matter if the roof is open or closed, there will only be one result.\u201d Gravell was renowned for his fervent patriotism and outpourings of emotion. \u201cIt reminded you of the reasons some of us play rugby and why some of us who do not play any more miss it so much,\u201d said McBryde. \u201cWe do not want to burn ourselves out mentally, but it was a great way to kick off the week because it focused minds. Now we put it to bed and draw on the experience on Saturday.\u201d The Wales wing George North was among the players who watched the performance. \u201cIt was powerful,\u201d he said. \u201cIt showed the pride Grav had in Wales, one we all have. Rugby can be methodical, but there is still room for passion in the game.\u201d Wales know they will need to use their heads as well as their hearts if they are to defeat England and remain on course for their fourth Six Nations title since Warren Gatland took over as head coach at the end of 2007. \u201cIt is a big game,\u201d said McBryde. \u201cEngland are riding high on the back of two very good performances while we have had the results but perhaps not the performances. We have got a bit of work ahead of us. They have started matches strongly so we have to be able to weather the storm. We are going to have to be at our best.\u201d Wales are seeking a record 12th consecutive victory, prompting the England head coach Eddie Jones to remark that they were the best Wales team ever. \u201cI am not getting into mind games,\u201d said McBryde. \u201cEngland will be confident and we have to match that. It is a formidable task.\u201d Two years ago, Jones suckered Wales into thinking he was happy for the roof to be closed only to demand that it remained open just before the deadline for a decision. There will be no repeat, with McBryde saying that with a dry forecast this week, Wales were not bothered about shutting it and believed the atmosphere would be highly charged whatever. McBryde said that the fly-half Dan Biggar, who suffered a knee injury playing for Northampton on Saturday, was on course to be fit for selection while the full-back Leigh Halfpenny is taking a full part in training having recovered from concussion, although it is three months since he last played."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
