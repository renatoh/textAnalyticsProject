Birmingham have plummeted to 18th place in the wake of the punishment handed out last week, leaving them five points above the bottom three before Friday night\u2019s derby at West Brom. The penalty was imposed after Birmingham recorded total losses of \u00a348.8m from the start of the 2015\u201116 season through to the end of the 2017\u201118 campaign, almost \u00a310m more than the \u00a339m limit. Monk, who was appointed 12 months ago, would not be drawn on whether he felt that the EFL\u2019s ruling was fair \u2013 there are no plans to appeal \u2013 but he said it was important Birmingham learned from their mistakes and become \u201csmart\u201d with their financial decision-making. His immediate focus, however, is on ensuring Birmingham retain their Championship status by getting back to the 50-point mark they were on before the punishment and which they had targeted. \u201cThe players have done very well this season at blocking out a lot of negativity and the fact that they achieved what we set out to do, and even had the possibility of more, just shows the head space they\u2019re in,\u201d Monk said. \u201cEven though they\u2019ve had another blow with these nine points, it doesn\u2019t change what we set out to do. It just means we have to do it all over again. I\u2019m confident and the reason why is the players have showed a huge amount of fight all season.\u201d The points deduction sets a precedent and there is a sense that several other clubs could face sanctions. \u201cI don\u2019t wish any clubs to have to go through what we have gone through. But of course those rules and regulations are there for a reason,\u201d Monk said. \u201cConsistency is what you expect.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
