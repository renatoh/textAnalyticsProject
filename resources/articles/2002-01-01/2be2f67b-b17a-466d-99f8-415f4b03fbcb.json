Charlton's manager Alan Curbishley was one of many managers watching the game. Indeed the directors' box, with Brian Talbot, Graham Rix and Steve Bruce in attendance, could have fielded a formidable five-a-side team. Bradford made a bright start, but how they could have done with a midfield trio of Talbot, Curbishley and Rix to dismantle the curtain of five men that Walsall strung across midfield. As well as restricting the Bantams to only a couple of chances after Lee Sharpe went close from distance in the fifth minute, the midfield quintet created enough chances to have booked Walsall's ticket for the Valley by the interval. The first of them followed some neat play between Zigor Aranalde and Darren Wrack on the left flank. After a one-two Aranalde delivered a cross which Darren Byfield, with a first-time shot, sent wide when he had only the goalkeeper Carl Muggleton to beat. Byfield, who scored for the Saddlers in last season's play-off final against Reading, was given as good a chance again in the 21st minute but on that occasion failed to get a shot in. After being set up by Brett Angell's through-ball, Byfield hes itated and allowed the defender Andy Tod to make a timely clearance. Carlos Andre also wasted a good chance for the Saddlers before Bradford came more into the game as the half progressed. Wayne Jacobs almost gave them the lead with a stunning volley which just cleared the bar and Juanjo also fired an effort wide before Byfield forced a save from Muggleton. Walsall were indebted to the bravery and alertness of their goalkeeper James Walker when he saved a close-range shot from Ashley Ward after Stuart McCall and Eoin Jess had combined to open up the home defence. Bradford's chances were dealt a double blow by two first-half injuries, which resulted in the substitution of the central defender Robert Molenaar and the striker Robbie Blake. Two minutes into the second half they were damaged even further when Tom Bennett put Walsall ahead with a curling right-footed shot from the edge of the penalty area. Walsall doubled their lead 10 minutes later after Wrack collected Frederick Biancalani's pass down the inside-left channel before beating Tod and crossing for the diving Angell to head home at the far post. Andre almost added a third for Walsall when his fierce shot from distance proved too hot for Muggleton to handle."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
