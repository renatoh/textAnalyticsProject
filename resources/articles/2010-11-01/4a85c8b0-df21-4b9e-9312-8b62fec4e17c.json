Edin Dzeko, the prolific Wolfsburg striker, is the principal target, though City know from experience that the Bundesliga club can be difficult negotiators. The clubs spent most of the summer haggling over a fee for the Bosnia international before City walked away from the deal because of the disparity in what they were willing to pay, around \u00a325m to \u00a330m, and Wolfsburg's valuation of \u00a345m. Cook is meeting the club's chairman, Khaldoon al-Mubarak, and their agenda will also include how to trim the squad of some of Roberto Mancini's fringe players, part of the effort to reduce the wage bill in line with Uefa's fair-play regulations. The difficulty facing City is that their players are on such high salaries there is a fear potential buyers may be deterred. Wayne Bridge, who has already been informed he has no future at the club, earns \u00a395,000 a week, while Emmanuel Adebayor is one of City's higher earners, with a weekly salary in the region of \u00a3150,000. Adebayor's volatile relationship with the manager, Roberto Mancini, has improved recently and the club's coaching staff have been encouraged by his work on the training ground compared to six weeks ago when his attitude had become a major issue. Nonetheless, manager and player still have differences. Adebayor's reaction at the final whistle of last night's 0-0 draw with Manchester United, heading straight down the tunnel, made clear his displeasure about being brought on as a substitute for only the final few seconds. City's backroom staff have noted that when he was informed he was replacing Carlos Tevez he did not have his shin pads or his boots on. City will also listen to offers for the increasingly peripheral Shaun Wright-Phillips and Roque Santa Cruz while Shay Given wants a loan move after losing his place to Joe Hart. As for Mancini, the manager appears to have ridden the storm of losing three successive matches before Sunday's 2-0 victory at West Bromwich Albion, although many supporters have questioned the team's conservative tactics in the Manchester derby. Those criticisms were also aired by Graeme Souness and Ruud Gullit in their role as television pundits. \"Chelsea's goal difference is plus 23, City's is five,\" Souness said. \"I don't think you can go with that three of Tevez, [David] Silva and Yaya Tour\u00e9 if you want to play attractive football, be on the front foot, and win home games, which you must do if you are going to win anything.\" Gullit said: \"It's not pretty is it? You can see that they have difficulties to find each other [in attacking positions]. When they want to cross it, there is no one there to cross it to.\" The centre-half Kolo Tour\u00e9 defended Mancini's tactics. \"United are a top club with top players and it was important not to lose the game as we had to keep fourth place. When you play against the top teams the most important thing is to try not to lose. It was a difficult game for us and we are delighted with a draw.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
