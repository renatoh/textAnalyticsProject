Is this the way it\u2019s going to be? This is how we\u2019re going to play it? The political discourse in this country, having been sputtering for some time, finally went into its unstoppable death spin this week, trailing a plume of black smoke and echoing with the screams of the terrified and slightly bored voters trapped inside. We started out with a surrealist moment when everyone suddenly started talking about blue ties for no readily apparent reason. We then were subjected to the affair of the menu, in which we learnt just what classy, sophisticated affairs Liberal Party fundraisers are. We might have thought that that was going to be the nadir of this teeth-grindingly tacky week, but then West Australian talk radio host and alleged adult Howard Sattler demonstrated that our concepts of \u201cbottom of the barrel\u201d were wildly optimistic. Asking Julia Gillard if her boyfriend was gay, and then asking again, and then quite hilariously saying, \u201cit\u2019s not me saying it\u201d, Howard took the concept of \u201cjournalism\u201d, turned it inside out, and wore it like a particularly stupid hat. And so I ask again, really? It\u2019s not like Sattler is just some guy who randomly broke into a studio: he\u2019s a professional announcer following the same template for radio stardom that Alan Jones, Chris Smith, Ray Hadley, Steve Price and others have patented. Is this what we\u2019re going to have to put up with? A political debate that revolves around sniggering at women\u2019s body parts and smirks about gay hairdressers? People will protest that Sattler wasn\u2019t being sexist, because every time someone is sexist in public people protest that they weren\u2019t being sexist. You could ask these people to reel off the number of times that previous prime ministers were asked if their wives were lesbians: in fact you could ask them to specify those occasions on which previous prime ministers were quizzed on any aspect of their wives\u2019 sex lives at all; but they\u2019d be unlikely to take the point, because they are not very bright. But I understand the urge to deny that sexism is happening, because I\u2019m a man and I hate talking about sexism: it makes me feel guilty and self-conscious. It is, frankly, awkward. But that\u2019s OK: let\u2019s not talk about sexism. Let\u2019s talk about manners. Let\u2019s talk about the way you talk to another human being. In this case, as it so happened, the other human being was the prime minister of Australia, who you had invited onto your radio show for a serious interview. But even leaving all that aside, let us consider, when you are having a conversation with somebody, how do you talk to them? You don\u2019t talk to them the way Sattler talked to Gillard, unless you want to be quite explicit about the fact that you are a rude, ill-mannered, nasty little boor. And that\u2019s the sexism, right there: the belief that the opposite sex is so far beneath you that you don\u2019t even have to worry about whether you\u2019re rude to them or not. So, really? Having reassured ourselves that we\u2019re justified in \u201cholding them to account\u201d and \u201chaving robust debates\u201d and \u201cspeaking truth to power\u201d, we\u2019re now just flat-out rude to their faces? When our leaders face us, do we want to grill them over what they\u2019re doing right and what they\u2019re doing wrong, or do we want to have a giggle about their genitalia and their boyfriend\u2019s sexuality? Look Australia, it\u2019s your decision, but you should know: right now, you\u2019re an embarrassment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
