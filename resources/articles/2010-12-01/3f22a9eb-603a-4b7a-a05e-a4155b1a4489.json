Formerly known as Brent Burkhart, and once involved in experimental rock bands in the southern US, he has a genuine background in frantic sacred music, being the son of a preacher who presided over tent revivalist meetings in a Navajo reservation in Arizona. He says he acquired his name because he lost an eye to a rattlesnake, and because he shares his father's fervour \u2013 if not always the same beliefs. He plays a guitar that uses a wok as a resonator but he is far more than a novelty act, for there's an impressive appreciation of country, rockabilly and early blues in his DIY gospel-folk-punk style. He sings like a declamatory evangelist on the gutsy Can't Take It With You, sounds like Johnny Cash on Led His Children Out of Bondage, calms down just a little for Jesus on the Mainline (popularised by Ry Cooder in the mid-70s) and switches to slow, sad country ballads with Coldest Heart and Her Heart Belongs to the Wind. It works, for the most part, because each song is treated with complete conviction."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
