But once upon a time, Gibson was positively adored, the hottest thing since sliced bread. As the historian AJP Taylor once put it, when something is now very much in the past, it is hard to remember that it was once still in the future. Thus it will shock many to learn that Gibson, like Paul McCartney and Sting and even Madonna, was once a breath of fresh air. When Mad Max first started making the circuit in 1979, hipsters were all over it. Gibson also won over critics' hearts with his top-notch performances in Gallipoli and The Year of Living Dangerously, both directed by the very young, very gifted Peter Weir. At the dawn of his career, Gibson seemed like just what the film industry ordered: a cocky, likable Australian with easy charm. At that time Aussies with easy charm were a novelty in the film industry. No longer. Now that Gibson's entire career is on hold, after the LA County sheriff's department investigated him this summer for alleged domestic violence, there is simply no telling whether he can return from the dead. The New York Times recently ran an extensive piece speculating that Gibson's career might actually be over \u2013 despite his forthcoming appearance in The Beaver, directed by Jodie Foster \u2013 a cumulative victim of his domestic problems, his family court problems, and his racist and antisemitic outbursts. Famous for making a nasty, Jew-baiting film in a town where Jews are by no means under-represented, and for subsequently attacking Jews during a 2006 driving-under-the-influence incident involving the Malibu police, even as prolific and successful a film-maker as Gibson may find that his star has finally set and his ship gone out to sea for good. I have no way of knowing whether Gibson can find his way out of the mess he finds himself in. It's worth pointing out that the most popular football player in America at the present moment is a breathtakingly gifted 31-year-old man who spent 18 months in jail for torturing and killing dogs while operating a criminal dogfighting ring \u2013 and who may yet waltz off with the National Football League's most valuable player award this year. Proving, once again, that everybody, or at least most people, love a winner. Were Gibson to make amends to his estranged girlfriend, Oksana Grigorieva, and their child, and to the ex-wife who bore him seven children, and to those seven children, and to the Jewish-American community, and to women in general, and to the Malibu police force, and then perhaps direct a stirring film on a par with Braveheart or The Patriot \u2013 a film about the Maccabees is one suggestion \u2013 he might still claw his way out of the hole he has dug himself into. But it's going to take some digging. If the year 2010 is the year Gibson goes down for the count, that is not necessarily something to cheer about, at least not from the film buff's point of view. (I, for one, was really looking forward to his mysterious Leonardo DiCaprio Viking-era film, with dialogue conducted entirely in, well, Viking.) This is not an industry that can afford to lose talented actors and directors; it doesn't have that many of them. Moreover, you simply cannot talk about the last three decades of motion picture history without talking about Gibson's part in it. He is a linchpin of the industry, the kind of mainstream actor (not unlike John Wayne or Steve McQueen or Clint Eastwood) who does not himself win acting awards, but without whom there would be no actors making films. Whatever you may think of him, Mel Gibson is Hollywood. Thus, if his career is coming to an unexpectedly early conclusion \u2013 an event many people in America and in the industry are hoping for \u2013 this will be a classic case of good love gone bad. Gibson is a very serviceable actor, a nuanced performer capable of playing both light and dark, as he has shown again and again in films as varied as The Bounty, The Man Without a Face, Bird on a Wire, Mrs Soffel, Maverick, What Women Want, Signs and, of course, the enormously successful Lethal Weapon series. Unlike Tom Cruise and Harrison Ford, whose work never had much appeal to the arty crowd, Gibson impressed them early on with the much- admired Gallipoli, and followed up with the thoughtful The Year of Living Dangerously. Then he made the second and third Mad Max films and became the Mel Gibson we all know. He has made plenty of mediocre films \u2013 the joke had worn thin by the time Lethal Weapon 3 rolled into production \u2013 and he has made some bad films \u2013 Payback, Conspiracy Theory \u2013 but he himself was not bad in them. The ratio of good Mel Gibson films to his total number of films is reasonably high; in this sense he resembles Michael Douglas. Gibson has also on occasion been willing to put himself at risk \u2013 as he did in Hamlet, in which he joined a long list of actors who were either too old to play the part (Laurence Olivier, Kenneth Branagh), or too obviously manipulative (Jude Law) to be the callow, indecisive Dane. If it is true that quite early in his career he came to rely on that impish eye-rolling, or keeping his mouth slightly ajar while conversing with others, or pulling his eyes away from other actors and then suddenly firing a sideways glance back at them, these tics were no more annoying than Eastwood's trademark squint or Cruise's high-beam smile. Gibson, like McQueen, is one of those actors who made his debut on screen equipped with a full complement of acting chops, and pretty much stayed the way he was for the next 30 years. Movie stars more than actors, these types of performers don't get any better, and they don't get any worse. If it worked at the beginning, it will work at the end. Some, perhaps most, actors wear out their welcome on screen. But that did not happen with Gibson; he was as good in last year's generic Edge of Darkness as he was in Gallipoli and Mad Max. Unlike Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, who deliver one listless, fatigued, phoned-in performance after another at this stage in their careers, Gibson has always gone about his job in a professional fashion. He may be cynical in real life, but he is not cynical on screen. Gibson is also a very fine, and in many ways daring director. Braveheart, a throwback film, is the kind of lusty historical epic that evokes Ben-Hur and Doctor Zhivago. The same is true of The Patriot and of his very strange, very entertaining Apocalypto, which contains no English dialogue. Indeed, one of the most troubling things about The Passion of the Christ, a film whose cavalier antisemitism makes it seem like something written in the Middle Ages by someone whose dad doesn't care much for Jews, is how well-made a film it is. In undertaking this benighted project, Gibson set out to show that the last 18 hours in the life of Jesus Christ were nauseatingly unpleasant. He most certainly succeeded. Though The Passion of the Christ was an enormous financial success, it was a huge mistake from a public relations point of view. It ushered in the dark, disgraceful era in Gibson's life, a period from which he may never re-emerge. It was a stupid idea to make the film, Gibson's self-destructive decision evoking an interesting parallel between his career and the personalities of some of the characters he plays. Conspiracy Theory, a film about a man who seems to have taken leave of his senses, is the most obvious example. Mad Max, a film about one man against the world, is yet another. But the most pertinent of all is Ransom, Ron Howard's dreary remake of Akira Kurosawa's brilliant High and Low, which stars Gibson as a tycoon who refuses to pay $2m for the return of his kidnapped son and instead puts a $2m bounty on the kidnappers' heads. Ransom is a movie about a pigheaded man who does something he will never be forgiven for, even if things ultimately turn out for the best. It is a film about a previously admired man who thumbs his nose at society's basic values in his determination to be proven right, and risks destroying his family in the process. The character Gibson plays in Ransom sounds an awful lot like the man who set out to make a film blaming Jews for killing Christ. For years I have been struck by how much dislike of the British empire has coloured Gibson's films. Gallipoli is an indictment of British conduct during the first world war. The Patriot, whose emotional high point is a massacre perpetrated by the redcoats, displays a hatred of the English that rarely makes its way into American films, where the English are invariably portrayed as our haughty, biscuit-nibbling cousins, but never as monsters. The Bounty, suffused with antagonism between officers and deck hands, is an assault on the British class system, and Braveheart is an unsparing attack on England in general. This anti-Brit attitude is ironic because Gibson's career has come to resemble that of Henry VIII, who started out a flashy, dapper, much admired young chap, but ended up a sociopath who simply could not get along with women. Say what you will, both men had fascinating careers. Henry VIII, by the way, saw his reign end in his 55th year. Mel Gibson will turn 55 in January."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
