Edgy Ethan Hawke and the reliably squalid Philip Seymour Hoffman are the chalk-and-cheese siblings who conspire to knock over a mom-and-pop jewellery store, the killer twist being that it's their mom and pop. Ever-darkening shenanigans ensue as the brothers' tragic endeavours unspool in flashback and we see their family falling apart before our eyes. Despite his advancing years, Lumet directs with the acerbic wit, energy and lusty gusto of a man half his age. Mark Kermode Penelope 2006, U, Momentum \u00a316.99 Christina Ricci is the girl with a pig's nose - literally - in this ill-judged 'modern' fairy tale about a cursed heiress who can only be physically transformed by true love. Set in some ghastly netherworld between London and New York, the film's transatlantic casting finds James McAvoy and Richard E Grant wrestling with mangled hybrid accents, while Reese Witherspoon zips around on a scooter offering moral support. Only the terrific and versatile Peter Dinklage provides a ray of entertaining hope as a scuzzy photographer whose activities propel Penelope to stardom. Pig's nose? Pig's ear, more like. Mark Kermode O Lucky Man! 1973, 15, Warner \u00a315.99 The centrepiece of Lindsay Anderson's satirical trilogy about the state of Britain (standing between If and Britannia Hospital), this surreal masterwork takes former public-school boy Mick Travis (Malcolm McDowell) on a disillusioning journey around a decadent Britain where everyone is involved in some sort of corrupt activity, ranging from genetic engineering to gun-running. A cast of Anderson's stage and screen regulars (including Ralph Richardson, Arthur Lowe, Helen Mirren and Graham Crowden) does remarkable work and the brilliant Czech cameraman Miroslav Ondricek gives it a sinister, alien look. Alan Price, the film's good guy, provides the music. On this double-disc edition, there's a commentary by McDowell, Price and screenwriter David Sherwin, and a lengthy documentary on McDowell directed by Stanley Kubrick's brother- in-law, Jan Harlan.
