At least Elwood is; Jake is struggling with asthma because of the smoke blanketing Sydney. Their parents, Hope Brett Bowen and Gavin Anderson, are trying to keep them out of trouble while having an adult conversation. The couple are distracted and sleep-deprived but wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. Both are relishing every moment with the much longed-for pair, conceived after years of IVF treatment. The couple has been together for 17 years and theirs is a slow-burn but very relatable love story. They met at a party in 2000 when they were both studying at the University of Sydney. She was doing law; he was doing engineering. Like many good university stories, memories of that night are sketchy but Bowen and her friend arrived at the party dressed in medieval gear. Awkwardly, they were the only ones. \u201cIt was really uncomfortable being the only people there in that get-up,\u201d she remembers with a laugh. \u201cGavin later on told me that his first impression was that weird chick in the weird gear.\u201d The two bumped into each other a few more times. Then one night, after a late evening law revue, Anderson waited with Bowen to make sure she caught her bus home. He shrugs it off now but it made an impression on her: \u201c[I thought] He\u2019s very sweet. There were no expectations or anything else. He was just being nice.\u201d After eighteen months of him being \u201ca nice bloke\u201d, she decided they should date. Their relationship unfolded slowly. It was a good sign when she passed the Ross test. \u201c[Gavin] was living with two of his mates and Ross, he was relatively attractive, he used to crack on to any of his girlfriends to see which ones were okay. Because I didn\u2019t flirt back, I was okay. I had no interest \u2013 I only had eyes for Gavin.\u201d They moved in together a few years later, still carefully maintaining their independence, then decided to get married in 2009. While Bowen hadn\u2019t planned on getting married, she knew Anderson wanted a family so she told him it was time. When asked why he\u2019d asked her to marry him, Anderson answers in that typically Aussie bloke deadpan: \u201cShe\u2019s the only one stupid enough to stay yes.\u201d Around that time, Bowen was juggling three jobs and working seven days a week: as a lawyer doing asbestos law, working on a charity and as a local councillor. Anderson was supportive, describing her as a go-getter. \u201cIt was good to watch and seeing her actually able to achieve some stuff for the community. I was proud of her.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t an easy time. Bowen was the only woman on an otherwise all-male council and faced tremendous sexism. She often came home feeling dejected. Anderson had a fail-safe remedy: \u201c[I\u2019d say] Want a beer?\u201d It was exactly what she needed: \u201cI like that, most of the time. Don\u2019t offer advice. Just listen. If I want advice, I\u2019ll ask. If I don\u2019t want it then I just need to blurt it out, then I\u2019ll talk myself into a solution.\u201d Being honest with each other also helped: \u201cEven just sitting next to each other and letting the other person cry. That may seem like a horrible thing but it really is a good thing as well because it\u2019s a genuine thing that you\u2019re sharing.\u201d Sheer determination held them together. \u201cI wasn\u2019t pleasant to be around [and] because I wasn\u2019t pleasant, Gavin wasn\u2019t pleasant to be around. It was rough but we stuck it out \u2026 I don\u2019t like to give up. Gavin doesn\u2019t really like to give up too, he\u2019s very loyal.\u201d They spent some time apart. Anderson, who is part of the army reserve, had long hoped to take up an overseas posting. So when he was called up to go to the Solomon Islands on peacekeeping duties for seven months, he had his wife\u2019s full support. She jokes that she \u201clost weight and got a lot of stuff done\u201d while they were apart, but they missed each other terribly. When he returned, they tried to conceive. Things didn\u2019t happen easily, so they turned to IVF, both injecting themselves with vitamins and hormones. Relationships often struggle under that pressure and theirs was no different. \u201cI wasn\u2019t hearing the stress Gavin was going through and I don\u2019t think he was hearing the stress I was going through. So we\u2019d fight sometimes.\u201d The highs and lows kept coming, says Bowen, but they hung in there. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to hear each other first because sometimes you\u2019re so caught up in your own grief \u2013 and it\u2019s grief, every time.\u201d Anderson tried to manage the situation in his own way. \u201cI tried to set my expectations low. Going in, I had to mentally prepare myself with [the thought that] it\u2019d be great if we get somewhere but there\u2019s a reasonable chance we won\u2019t. [But] it\u2019s hard watching your wife go through that. The pain, putting a needle through an existing bruise.\u201d After nine rounds of IVF, Bowen fell pregnant. Although they were thrilled, they were stunned to realise she was carrying twins. It should have been a time of joy but the couple were anxious for many weeks, particularly after Bowen was hospitalised for bed rest when she was 29 weeks pregnant. The next few weeks were torturous: \u201cThat sucked. I really wanted my husband but I had to keep these two safe,\u201d says Bowen. Each morning Anderson would bring her a laptop so she could work and play video games; each night he would bring her dinner to compensate for the lousy hospital food. Three weeks later, the twins were born prematurely on Australia Day. It wasn\u2019t an easy birth, with little Jake put into an incubator. Anderson felt helpless: \u201cI remember following Jake through and the nurse was setting him up. I was standing very nervously outside the room [watching her.] She said \u2018it\u2019s all good, he\u2019s fine\u2019.\u201d Nor was it smooth sailing when the twins went home. Bowen suffered from severe post natal depression, slipping into psychosis for a few weeks. Fortunately they were staying with her family and Anderson and her parents realised what was happening and got her help. \u201c[They] cottoned on pretty quick what I needed, which was sleep. So we worked out shifts so I wasn\u2019t with them 24/7. If I could get a solid six hours a night, then I could survive on that.\u201d These days the little family are in their own home again, juggling a recent renovation and dreaming about moving out of the city one day. After everything they\u2019ve been through, their commitment is stronger than ever. Says Bowen: \u201cThe good times don\u2019t last forever and the bad times don\u2019t last forever. And you can get some good out of the bad too, even when things were pretty frickin\u2019 horrible.\u201d For Anderson, commitment means looking after each other: \u201cCompromise here and there. Try and find the right balance [between what] you need to survive and stay healthy, and what they need.\u201d Good communication is key for Bowen: \u201cIt\u2019s not so much about being blunt with each other. You never hate the person. You can dislike an action, but not the person. So whenever you argue, it can\u2019t get personal. But you can\u2019t be afraid to voice your opinions. And try to turn it into something positive.\u201d Anderson agrees, adding: \u201cAnd you\u2019ve got to let them walk away too.\u201d Bowen says keep things in perspective. \u201cWhen things turn bad, it doesn\u2019t mean everything has been bad or everything will be bad. I call them \u2018shit goggles\u2019. You\u2019re starting to view things through what you\u2019re perceiving right now. And that doesn\u2019t work. There\u2019s good and bad in everything, nothing is hunky-dory 100% of the time. During the worst, the hardest things, [there\u2019s good] even if it\u2019s just a sense of humour.\u201d \u2022 We want to hear your stories about staying together.
