In Buzzfeed\u2019s highly imitable style, here are six things we learned from their chat: Cameron on being an MP Cameron said he wanted to remain as an MP in his Witney constituency even if he is no longer prime minister. He has held the Oxfordshire seat since 2001. \u201cI have 50 days to fight a vital election, I want to win re-election. It\u2019s the country\u2019s choice,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they hoof me out and go for the other guy I\u2019ll have to think of something else, but I hope I\u2019ll still be an MP. \u201cI love serving my constituents, I love politics, I love public service, it\u2019s what I care about. \u201cIt\u2019s a vocation for me. In the unhappy event I\u2019m not prime minister on 8 May, the people of West Oxfordshire, I hope, will stick with me and I\u2019ll stick with them.\u201d On Isis The prime minister said the three London schoolgirls who have reportedly travelled to Syria to support Isis are \u201cdeeply misguided\u201d. He said: \u201cIt is unbelievably depressing that in our country \u2013 which is a brilliant free country with a free press, the rule of law, democracy, great opportunity \u2013 that people from an outstanding school in Greenwich can opt to go and join a death cult in Syria that believes in throwing gay people off buildings and cutting people\u2019s heads off in the desert. \u201cWe have got to do everything we can, not just to stop people from going but also to stand up for the values we hold in this country and say this is so much better than this appalling death cult.\u201d On kitchens Cameron disclosed that \u2013 like Labour leader Ed Miliband \u2013 he has two kitchens in his London home. But he added that he had the second kitchen installed in his house in north Kensington home for the benefit of the carers who looked after his disabled son, Ivan, who died in 2009. Miliband had faced accusations that he was out of touch following the disclosure that his house had two kitchens after he and his wife Justine were filmed in the smaller of the two rooms for a BBC interview. This is used as their main kitchen. Cameron said: \u201cWe actually had to extend into the basement and we put in an extra kitchen, not least because I had a very disabled son, Ivan, and his carers were there and they looked after him and so we did that for them, as well as for him.\u201d He added: \u201cThe point is not whether you have got two kitchens, but whether you have a photocall in one of them and pretend it\u2019s your kitchen. That\u2019s the issue.\u201d On party leaders\u2019 debates Cameron said he was ready to take part in an online debate with the other leaders before the general election campaign gets under way at the end of March. Although he has ruled out taking part in the three debates on the timetable proposed by the TV broadcasters for the campaign \u2013 including a final head-to-head confrontation with Miliband \u2013 he told BuzzFeed he would be prepared to take part in a Buzzfeed-hosted \u201cmulti-party\u201d debate next week if the site could get his opposite numbers to agree to appear. He suggested he was also sympathetic to a proposal put forward by the Guardian, the Daily Telegraph and Google \u2013 which owns YouTube \u2013 for an online debate involving the six main UK party leaders. \u201cI\u2019m up for a debate, I\u2019m up for a multi-party debate, whether it is you, whether it is another digital debate, whether it is the TV broadcasters \u2013 that matters less to me than having a multi-party debate before the campaign gets under way,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s got to agree to it but I\u2019ve said very clearly \u2013 multi-party debate before the campaign, where do I sign?\u201d On technology He denied he is seeking to ban any encrypted messaging service that is beyond the reach of the security services. \u201cI think the overwhelming majority of the British people would say: yes of course I don\u2019t want people routinely reading my emails or interfering in my calls but if there is a suspicion of terrorist activity I want the government to be able to keep this country safe.\u201d Cameron confirmed that he has a private Gmail account which he uses for emailing friends. \u201cI have an iPhone, which is mostly for family and friends, and I have a BlackBerry which I use for work. BlackBerry is very good for emails.\u201d Challenged by Waterson, who said he must be the last person still using a BlackBerry, Cameron said: \u201cThe government has a BlackBerry service and they are very good for emails and documents.\u201d On football Showing that he is well prepared for awkward questions from journalists keen to catch him out on the election trail, the prime minister survived a quickfire section at the end. Cameron, an Aston Villa fan, answered immediately when asked to name his favourite current Villa player. \u201cProbably [Christian] Benteke because he has been so valuable these last few years,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
