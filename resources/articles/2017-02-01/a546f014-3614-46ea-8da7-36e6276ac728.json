Chelsea were also the first team Dyche faced when he joined the ranks of Premier League managers last time round, when Diego Costa\u2019s first competitive goal in English football paved the way for a 3-1 away win in 2014. Right at the start of this season the Clarets shipped another three goals at Stamford Bridge, even though Chelsea were still stuttering under Antonio Conte and yet to hit on the formational switch that transformed their season. Burnley have famously picked up only one point away from home all season and after the league leaders at Turf Moor this afternoon they face four consecutive away games. It is conceivable that it could be April before further progress is made in the battle to ensure survival, though Dyche is not unduly worried about the situation. If points were handed out for being relaxed, affable and positive whatever the challenge ahead, the Burnley manager would be even higher up the table than he is already. \u201cEvery game you play is a challenge when you are in the Premier League but these are the teams we wanted to play when we were winning promotion from the last division,\u201d he says. \u201cWe could do with picking up more points away from home but performance-wise I\u2019ve been pleased with the last four away games, against some really strong teams. If you keep performing at the right level you will win games eventually. \u201cThat\u2019s what I keep telling my players and I don\u2019t think it is an idle promise. There are no guarantees, we\u2019ve had a number of contentious decisions go against us and things like that are out of our control. But it\u2019s my belief that, if you put in the work and the performances, you will get a reward.\u201d Burnley\u2019s remarkable home form is what has been keeping them safely above the relegation scrap a few places below. With nine wins and a draw contributing 28 points to the club\u2019s total of 29, Dyche\u2019s stated aim of turning Turf Moor into a fortress has turned into a reality. He accepts that Chelsea are likely to present the toughest test to date \u2013 \u201cthey were miles better than us in August and they have morphed into an even stronger unit since\u201d \u2013 but refuses to countenance the notion that Burnley have no chance. \u201cAs long as it is eleven v eleven you always have a chance,\u201d he says. \u201cFair enough, we are underdogs but we don\u2019t do blind faith here. We try everything we can to see what works. \u201cI must admit I cannot see many weaknesses in this Chelsea side but it\u2019s up to us to find a way to make something happen. We have to believe we can do that because football is full of surprises. No one thought Liverpool had any weaknesses until very recently.\u201d Dyche\u2019s side were the first to beat Liverpool this season, well before their January wobble, and since then Burnley have been active in the transfer market, bringing in Robbie Brady and Ashley Westwood in quite a busy window. The impression from outside was that with a reasonable toe-hold on Premier League security the club were now finding it easier to attract players, but Dyche claims it was simply a matter of following targets who had not been available in the summer. \u201cWe had a budget worked out in summer and a list of players we wanted to sign,\u201d he says. \u201cFor a variety of reasons we were not able to do as much business at that time but the beauty of identifying long-term targets is that they are still desirable six months down the line and in January we found it easier to reach agreement with the other clubs involved. \u201cTo be fair to the board there was always an intent to strengthen, the money we have spent over the season is still within the realms of what was originally planned. Part of our growth has been to get to a level where we can compete but of course it is hard to compete with the superpower teams like Chelsea. \u201cMost of our players come from the Championship; Chelsea can get more or less anyone from around the world. Some clubs in this division have owners who say it doesn\u2019t matter what they spend. I don\u2019t know what happened to Financial Fair Play but it didn\u2019t exactly level the playing field. \u201cWe\u2019ve all seen the heaven and hell of the Premier League when clubs throw money at the problem and end up in pretty bad shape. We can\u2019t do that and nor should we. We work to a fairly simple business model here: don\u2019t bet the ranch.\u201d Though not quite at Chelsea\u2019s level \u2013 \u201cthey are a fantastic side delivering very strong performances\u201d \u2013 Dyche feels Burnley have matured into a hardier Premier League proposition this time round. \u201cWe are a little more rounded, a little more sure of ourselves, everything seems to have moved a step forward,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is fair to say it is tougher against the superpower clubs. There\u2019s a group of them and we all know who they are. They are a step above most of us but we still believe in what we do and that\u2019s important. \u201cThere haven\u2019t been any gimmes at this club. We have all had to work for everything we have got and what that means is that the players here know the value of what they have got. We are not just going to sit back and say, \u2018Oh wow, we are playing against Chelsea.\u2019 This is what we signed up for and we\u2019ll be up for it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
