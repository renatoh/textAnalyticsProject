Mark Thompson's announcement last week is a welcome step towards a more open programme-supply market at the BBC, after more than a decade of fudge and protectionism manifested by a repeated failure to hit the basic 25% indie quota. We are promised a \"substantially simpler and streamlined commissioning process to make it fairer and more open to all producers\". This, too, is encouraging but it is not the simple unequivocal statement of meritocratic intent that I had hoped for. It will be a bit fairer and a bit more open, not totally fair and totally open. I smell another BBC fudge in the offing and it centres round the vexed issue of in-house production and its relationship with broadcasting. Commercial TV sorted this some time ago. The split of the broadcasting and producing functions of the old ITV companies became inevitable in the late 80s once the old BBC/ITV duoply had broken down and competition from multichannel TV in broadcasting and from the newly-empowered independent sector in programme-making started to bite. The 1990 broadcasting bill created a network commissioning centre for ITV which was legally required to pick the best programmes from whatever source. Over at the BBC, John Birt introduced the infamous \"producer choice\" in 1993. Vertical integration was out and internal markets were in. Although the technical resourcing (eg, studios and editing) of programmes was separated from production, initially broadcasting and production remained under the same management, albeit with a buyer (broadcasting) / seller (production) relationship. The management of the television service, then led by Will Wyatt, was seeking to preserve some semblance of \"one BBC\" against Birt's unfailing logic that the functions should formerly split. Not every BBC programme department was yet strong enough to prosper in a competitive market. Of course, Birt ultimately prevailed, but interestingly only by actioning the plan without any consultation with senior management. This further depressed morale and the rather fraught and protracted birth that ensued made Greg Dyke's embrace of \"one BBC\", two years later, an easy early win with the staff. Under Dyke the production-broadcasting split was once again a fudge, with genre heads responsible for in-house production and for commissioning programmes from their competitors in the independent sector. Not surprisingly the BBC struggled to reach the statutory minimum quota of 25%, giving rise to the accusation that the BBC was treating the quota as a ceiling as well as a floor. Dyke's comments that it wasn't the BBC's job to make independent producers rich reinforced that view. This was not a sustainable position for a publicly-funded broadcaster to take particularly because the BBC funds more original production than any other UK broadcaster. A review of the programme supply market, initiated by the department of culture, challenged the BBC to get its relationship with the independent sector in order. With new management, and charter renewal on the horizon, we arrive at last week's announcement. It is an important step forward but it doesn't look like the BBC is ready for a totally meritocratic commissioning system. Yet real benefits would flow from this. Broadcasting would be free to pick the best idea, negotiate the best price with a single-minded focus on delivering the best service to the licence payer. Production would have to sharpen up to ensure that it was competitive in the commissioning process. If it didn't, it would lose commissions and have to size itself accordingly. It's a simple market mechanism that all independent producers have to live with. Why should the BBC be treated differently? In truth they would have little to fear. They already produce almost three-quarters of the BBC's programmes and with that kind of critical mass there is no reason why they should not remain Britain's biggest programme producer. Granada managed it from a similar position in the commercial sector. The audience doesn't differentiate programmes by producer. Have I Got News for You (a Hat Trick production) is no less a BBC programme than Little Britain (a BBC production). Meritocracy should be a key principle of the new charter, supported by a transparent commissioning system, enforced by the new arm's-length BBC governors. Then we can wave goodbye to fudges and quotas for good."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
