Following a six-week high court trial in the spring, it had been thought that a deal had been agreed between the multi-millionaire boss of the company, Kirit Pathak, and his two sisters, who claimed they had been cheated out of their share of the business. The sisters, Chitralekha Mehta, 56, and Anila Shastri, 52, believed they would be receiving around \u00a34m in shares. Yesterday John McDonnell QC, for the sisters, claimed in the high court that Mr Pathak, 51, had reneged on the agreement. He said the sisters wanted the trial to resume and that they wanted to reserve the right to take separate action over Mr Pathak's supposed reneging on the deal. David Oliver QC, for Mr Pathak and his mother, Shantagaury Pathak, then accused Mr McDonnell of taking a \"scurrilous and unprofessional approach\". The notion that an agreement had been concluded in April was a \"non-starter\", he said. Negotiations on a settlement had continued for a long time after the last hearing. He added: \"I am very unwilling to see my clients subjected to yet further trial in these proceedings at grotesque public expense.\" Mr Oliver insisted the question of whether there had been a settlement had to be concluded before a trial resumed. Mr McDonnell replied: \"I have been accused by a very old friend of being scurrilous, which is a very serious matter.\" He added: \"I say with the greatest respect and affection for Mr Oliver that I am afraid his memory of events has become hazy.\" Mr Justice Evans-Lombe refused to order the resumption of the trial until the sisters had decided whether to pursue a separate action against their brother."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
