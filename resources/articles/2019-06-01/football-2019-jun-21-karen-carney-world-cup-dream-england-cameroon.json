She is also the most calming presence, on and off the pitch. \u201cI didn\u2019t pick Carney for 12 months,\u201d Neville said before the tournament. \u201cShe was coming back from injury, other players had taken their opportunities \u2013 she\u2019s been on standby lists for three or four squads. But then she came in for the Austria and Sweden camp in November. Then we took her to Qatar and it was in Qatar where I thought: \u2018Yep, she\u2019s coming to the World Cup.\u2019 Her influence on and off the field, her performance levels for Chelsea, in the big games, the big moments; she\u2019s a big-moment player.\u201d The Chelsea winger ponders the serenity that is said to accompany her. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I bring that calmness and I\u2019m not really aware of it, to be honest,\u201d she says. \u201cI just come on, smile and enjoy the moment. If that brings calmness, then great. In training I\u2019ll be in a different world and Phil will say to me: \u2018You\u2019re counting pigeons again.\u2019 And I think that\u2019s just who I am. I\u2019m usually in my own little world. I see things differently, I feel things differently and that\u2019s how I\u2019ve always been and that\u2019s why I\u2019m different to everyone else.\u201d The quietly spoken and well-mannered Carney, who talked in the buildup to this World Cup about her experiences with depression, prefers to steer clear of getting bogged down in the detail. \u201cI\u2019m not literally counting pigeons,\u201d she says. \u201cI think I like less detail. I try to keep things simple. Information simple. Detail simple. I just play. I just aim to play as if it was five-a-side, as if I was an 11-year-old kid. That\u2019s how I see it because that\u2019s how it is. That\u2019s what I try to tell the youngsters. You\u2019ve played in bigger venues, like Wembley; chill, relax, have fun. You\u2019re playing at a World Cup \u2013 it\u2019s your dream. Don\u2019t fear it, embrace it.\u201d She gravitates to the younger debutantes, eager to tap into the buzz she felt at her first World Cup in 2015. \u201cThey remind me of myself when I was in that first tournament. I don\u2019t say what I feel. I say what was said to me because my senior professionals were amazing to me. If I can do anything similar to the young pups I will do that. My senior pros protected me and looked after me and made me feel amazing.\u201d The 31-year-old is of the generation that had to fight to play. Now she is watching the younger players reap the rewards of her sacrifice, but she is not jealous. \u201cI never had any expectations,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I was 11, I just wanted to play for England. I didn\u2019t know when it would happen, how it would happen. I picked that dream and I wanted that dream. I didn\u2019t know how to process it. \u201cSince then, I\u2019ve travelled the world. I went to university \u2013 I never would have gone to university through football. I\u2019ve got a degree. I\u2019ve got a master\u2019s. I\u2019ve met some amazing people, I\u2019ve lived my dream. I\u2019ve picked up so many skill sets that I never would have. I haven\u2019t made a lot of money but I\u2019m comfortable. I have food, clothes on my back and my family. For me, I\u2019ll never be bitter.\u201d At this World Cup, and in Emma Hayes\u2019s Chelsea team, she looks happy. Carney came off the bench in all three group matches, albeit briefly against Argentina, and her performances mean she is staking a claim for a start in England\u2019s last-16 tie against an unpredictable but exciting Cameroon on Sunday. She provided the assist for Ellen White\u2019s second goal against Japan, which lifted the pressure. \u201cI\u2019m in a good spot \u2013 touch wood \u2013 and I credit a lot to my managers, Phil and Emma Hayes. They\u2019ve been amazing. And obviously my family have helped but I credit my two managers for making me enjoy my football and giving me the responsibility. I am very comfortable in my own skin \u2013 it\u2019s taken a long process and I\u2019m there finally.\u201d Carney likes Neville (in a video for the 90min website her teammates label her the teacher\u2019s pet). Perhaps the reason the pair get on is that they view football in context. \u201cPhil\u2019s just a human being. He looks after us as humans and wants to make sure that we\u2019re all OK and football\u2019s secondary \u2026 Well, it is secondary. \u201cHe\u2019s big on being a good person, staying humble, staying classy and looking after each other and you can only demand that from other people if that\u2019s what you are yourself. He is a person first.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
