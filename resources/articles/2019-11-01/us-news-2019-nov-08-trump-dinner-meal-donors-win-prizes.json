Media reports this week have cast doubt on whether the competitions produce real winners, fueling speculation that Trump, accused of swindling the public in past ventures such as Trump University, is at it again. Richard Painter, a former White House chief ethics lawyer, spoke out amid deepening questions over the fundraising lotteries that, so far, the Trump campaign has been unable to answer. \u201cI\u2019ve received dozens of these fundraising emails,\u201d said Painter, who was George W Bush\u2019s ethics counsel for two years. \u201cIf they have lunch or dinner, then it\u2019s OK. If not, then it\u2019s fraud. I\u2019ve seen no proof that they actually happen.\u201d The issue was first raised by the Popular Information website run by Judd Legum, former editor-in-chief of ThinkProgress, a progressive news site. It scrutinized at least 15 contests the Trump campaign has run since last year offering the chance to win breakfast, lunch or dinner with the president. \u201cSupporters are enticed to donate to Trump\u2019s campaign with promises of free travel, accommodations, and an \u2018epic\u2019 meal with Trump at various locations across the country,\u201d the site said. \u201cAn investigation by Popular Information, however, did not uncover evidence that anyone has ever actually won.\u201d A second post by Popular Information identified a prize of breakfast with Trump in New York, advertised in hundreds of Facebook ads, as fraudulent. It noted that while Joanna Kamis was invited to a breakfast event in the city, Trump did not attend any meal with her and only took a photo with her later. Painter, now a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School, said: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have the lunch or dinner. People pay money to enter it and you\u2019ve got an obligation to do what you say you\u2019re going to do. \u201cIf you did this is any other context, and you don\u2019t have a winner, it would be fraud and you get sent to jail for that. You can\u2019t just lie to people. We\u2019ve had fake lotteries in the past and it\u2019s illegal.\u201d Breaking bread with a political candidate is a tried and trusted stunt for raising publicity and raising cash. \u201cDinner with Barack\u201d was advertised by the previous president\u2019s re-election campaign in 2012. The Trump campaign, which has taken marketing, merchandising and data collection to new levels, is aggressive in promoting the meals via emails and social media, yet mysteriously slow to celebrate its winners. It rejects the allegation that it is operating a scam. Erin Perrine, the principal deputy communications director, told the Guardian in an email: \u201cWe have a winner for every contest. Any reporting otherwise is wrong.\u201d As supposed proof, Perrine sent a link to a Washington Post article from October 2017 that showed a photo of donor Chris Chavez and his father, Tracy Chavez, meeting Trump at a rally in Phoenix, Arizona. But Chavez had entered a different type of competition which did not involve a meal. The Guardian made contact with Chavez via Twitter and he quickly replied via email, but did not then respond to requests for comment. The Trump campaign\u2019s communications director, Tim Murtaugh, also tried to fight back via Twitter and tried to shoot the messenger by drawing attention to Legum\u2019s past in Democratic politics. \u201cPeople win the contests each time,\u201d Murtaugh wrote in response to a Vanity Fair follow-up, without offering evidence to support his claim. \u201cBut asking would\u2019ve gotten in the way of a clickbait headline, huh? And no we didn\u2019t respond to Judd Legum, ThinkProgress and Hillary alum, for obvious reasons.\u201d In apparent triumph, Murtaugh and Perrine then tweeted links to an article by the rightwing Daily Caller website, which purported to debunk the \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d. On closer inspection, it did no such thing. The article contained interviews with two \u201cwinners\u201d \u2013 Kamis and Chavez \u2013 who never had a meal with the president. What is baffling some observers about such episodes is that the cash-rich Trump campaign could easily foot the bill of flights, hotels and a three-course meal. And a photo of the president sharing a meal with a supporter would probably be good public relations, burnishing his claim to be a man of the people. Yet the campaign has been unable to supply one, leaving some to ponder whether Trump is less enamored of the so-called \u201cdeplorables\u201d who support his campaigns than he makes out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
