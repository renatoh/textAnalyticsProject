It is not just his ability, which is considerable; it is his demeanour, which is as cool as the winter's day on which we met in London. The unbeaten Welshman joined Eddie Hearn's Matchroom stable on Wednesday \u2013 following the signings of George Groves last week and Ricky Burns on Monday \u2013 and will prepare immediately for a defence of his British and Commonwealth featherweight titles in Blackpool on 20 April, possibly against Manchester's Joe Murray, the Beijing Olympian, unbeaten in 12 pro fights over four years, the last of them an eight-rounder in February, 2012. \"This kid is going to become a world champion,\" Hearn said of Selby. \"It's a bold statement but that's our aim. We want to build him into a superstar. He can punch, he can move, he's got swagger. He's just got something about him.\" Hearn said that, if Selby wins in Blackpool \u2013 no easy assignment, despite Murray's long absence from the ring \u2013 he would try to negotiate a challenge for a European title fight in Cardiff on 15 June, against the 27-year-old Belgium-based Armenian Alex Miskirtchian, and a world title shot \"within a year\". That is a dizzying schedule for any ambitious boxer but Selby, the 26-year-old brother of the London Olympian Andrew Selby, seemed unfazed. \"I would bet my house on winning a world title,\" he said, \"even though I live in a rented house.\" He might need a sense of humour to navigate the upper reaches of his sport, because the climb to the top in professional boxing is invariably hazardous. Nevertheless Selby's ring skills are sublime. His breakthrough performance was stopping Liverpool's unbeaten Stephen Smith in eight rounds to take his British and Commonwealth titles in front of his home crowd in 2011. And his toughest test arrived on the undercard of Hearn's promotion in Belfast in February, when he schooled the excellent Martin Lindsay over 12 rounds to retain his belts. A win over Murray, if Hearn can secure that challenge, would give the Barry-born boxer a treasured Lonsdale Belt. Fighting away from home does not bother him, as his manager, Chris Sanigar, confirmed. \"He has sparred in front of Floyd Mayweather in his gym in Las Vegas,\" Sanigar said, \"and had the crowd banging the canvas and the great man nodding in admiration.\" Selby moves with the smooth ease of a natural, the punches flowing with considerable venom and education, very little wasted. His hero is Thomas Hearns, he says, \"because I like to throw long, hard punches\". He admits he got careless against Lindsay and that he might have stopped him early had he pushed harder on the pedal. Yet he looked in control throughout. \"I'm a confident guy,\" Selby said. \"That's just my attitude. I've started off at the bottom on non-televised shows and, now I'm here, it's a great feeling and I have the chance to get the exposure I deserve.\" Selby's signature at least interrupted the flow of fighters from Frank Warren to Hearn, both promoters denying they are involved in a turf war. Nor did it snow in London on Wednesday. On Thursday it is Warren's turn, when he parades the maverick heavyweight Dereck Chisora, who has just regained his British licence, alongside his WBO light-heavyweight champion Nathan Cleverly and the brilliant young super-featherweight from Cromer, Liam Walsh. All three fight on BoxNation on 20 April, the Wembley Arena show postponed from 16 March after the switch of Groves and Burns, and the withdrawal of Burns's challenger, Miguel V\u00e1zquez, through illness. Cleverly has the most difficult assignment, a mandatory defence against the dangerous Serb Robin Krasniqi. Walsh, who was to have challenged Burns for his WBO lightweight title last year but had to pull out after a car accident, defends his Commonwealth title against an opponent yet to be named. Warren said of Chisora: \"I'm delighted that the British Boxing Board Control has made the right decision and reinstated Dereck's licence and the slate is now clean. He is an exciting fighter who always gives 100%. We will announce who Dereck will be fighting at Wembley Arena shortly but it's great to have him back in action and we've got some big plans for him.\" It will not be lost on Warren that his show goes up against Hearn's Blackpool promotion on the same night \u2013 as well as that of the American debut of the heavyweight Tyson Fury at Madison Square Garden. These are interesting times."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
