The steelworks closed for good 15 years ago, and today a familiar fare decorates the town\u2019s mournful high street: pound shops, arcades, bookies. On the brief walk from one end to the other, I count three pawnbrokers. \u201cIt ain\u2019t worth looking for any work up here,\u201d Rob Smyth, a youth worker tells me. \u201cI tell you what \u2013 I\u2019m glad I\u2019m old because if I was young now I\u2019d be struggling, you know? I know people who\u2019ve got degrees and all the rest of it, and they can\u2019t get work. You\u2019ve got to settle somewhere else and make a life for yourself. There\u2019s no life up here, no life at all. I only live here because it\u2019s cheap, and it\u2019s close to where I work.\u201d Ebbw Vale is the largest town in Blaenau Gwent. This autumn the county borough was found to be the cheapest place to buy a home in England and Wales (averaging \u00a3777 per sq m in 2016, compared with \u00a319,439 for the most expensive, London\u2019s Kensington and Chelsea). It offers the second-lowest mean salary in Britain, and its GCSE results are the worst in Wales. Five food banks operate within an area of about 42 square miles. People here are struggling economically and physically. It\u2019s a grim irony that an area encompassing the former constituency of Aneurin Bevan, architect of the National Health Service, should today be facing a quietly unfolding health crisis. Some 12% of working-age residents receive government support for disability or incapacity \u2013 twice the national average. Life expectancy for both men and women is among the lowest in England and Wales. Out of a population of 60,000, one in every six adults is being prescribed an antidepressant, according to NHS data from 2013. \u201cGPs haven\u2019t got time to listen, to talk to people, to find out what\u2019s going on. They\u2019ve got that five- or 10-minute slot, somebody\u2019s in tears, they\u2019re saying they\u2019re depressed,\u201d Tara Johnstone tells me at the Phoenix Project, the publicly funded drop-in centre where she works in nearby Brynmawr. It\u2019s run by a local charity, Torfaen and Blaenau Gwent Mind, and people come to chat about their problems: anxiety, depression, illness, bereavement. Most stories revolve around the same theme. \u201cIt\u2019s lack of work,\u201d explains Trish Richards, another Phoenix staff member. \u201cI\u2019ve had people come to me on zero-hours contracts. They don\u2019t know where they are from one week to the next. Can\u2019t plan. Can\u2019t even plan to go to the dentist in case they get called in to work.\u201d In the face of so many present-day problems, it\u2019s all too easy to become wistful for a lost golden era of nationalised industry that brought secure jobs and forged strong communities. The low-paid jobs in call centres and distribution sheds, most located in bigger cities, that eventually arrived to replace the noise and filth of the pits were cleaner and safer, but they lacked the solidarity and support networks. Soon they, too, may disappear. First globalisation, then austerity; now automation looms on the horizon. South Wales is particularly vulnerable, being heavily reliant on exactly the low-skilled jobs which are easiest to send offshore and automate out of existence. If they go, then so too may the young people who commute to these jobs from places such as Blaenau Gwent. \u201cIt\u2019s the easiest thing in the world to put your foot on someone\u2019s head when they\u2019re drowning. And that\u2019s what you see around here,\u201d Wayne Hodgins, an independent councillor for Brynmawr, tells me when we meet in one of the few pubs that are still open. \u201cThere was factories employing 100, 200 people. That factory environment \u2013 your friends, your colleagues \u2013 became an extension of your family.\u201d The professionalisation of even entry-level work has made it very difficult to find employment without some form of academic qualification or accredited skill. Consequently, Hodgins says, people here can feel worthless because they are \u201cgetting rejection letters right, left and centre ... They\u2019ve got nothing to get them out of bed in the morning.\u201d This, in many cases, can lead to a prescription for antidepressants. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people on social [benefits], there\u2019s a lot ill,\u201d says Allan Price, a former miner who volunteers at the South Wales Miners\u2019 museum amid the slopes of the Afan Valley, high above Port Talbot. \u201cEverybody in my village will tell you they know them. And lots of them come from good men and good families \u2013 hardworking.\u201d The deindustrialisation experiment inflicted on the valleys in the 1980s offers a cautionary tale for the next big transition. The region stands as an example of how not to move from one form of economic life to another \u2013 the Thatcherite omelette left many broken eggs. \u201cAutomation is a risk to many occupations across Wales and the UK,\u201d says Professor Julie Lydon, chair of Universities Wales who recently wrote an article entitled The Robots are Coming. The key to avoiding a repeat of the devastation caused when the mines and factories shut is investment in skills, according to Lydon. \u201cDemand in Wales for jobs that require higher-level skills is increasing, and evidence shows these jobs are less vulnerable to automation. We must focus on developing skills which are with you for life, and make you more adaptable and employable through your career. This will mean building on existing collaboration between universities, employers and colleges, and finding new ways to provide these skills, such as through degree apprenticeships.\u201d This will require government and employers to take more action than they have so far been prepared to do. Research in 2014 indicated that employers in Wales lagged behind the rest of the country in offering training: just 62% said they had done so in the previous 12 months, compared to the UK average of 66%. Nick Smith, MP for Blaenau Gwent, says some investment in road infrastructure has already arrived, and that the area must revive its tourist industry. \u201cThere\u2019s been \u00a3200m provided by the Welsh government. We\u2019ve also had in the last 10 years a new railway line from Cardiff to Ebbw Vale. If we improve transport infrastructure, I think it will help Blaenau Gwent as a destination, to enjoy the fantastic scenery. I\u2019m a hiker, and there\u2019s nothing better than to get up there and to fill your lungs with the fresh air.\u201d Rebuilding dignity Cath Jones is 31 and before she showed up at the Phoenix Project looking for help, she\u2019d been in and out of mental health institutions since she was 15. \u201cIn three, four years I had 50 admissions to a psychiatric ward,\u201d she tells me over a cup of milky tea. \u201cI was on five or six different antidepressants, antipsychotics, sleeping tablets, diazepam. You name it, I was on it.\u201d She insists she\u2019d have been \u201csix feet under\u201d were it not for the help and advice she received at the Phoenix. In terms of getting people fit, well and \u2013 eventually \u2013 back to work, Trish Richards tells me that the Westminster government is lukewarm about initiatives such as the Phoenix Project. \u201cThey don\u2019t see the fact that somebody getting up in the morning, getting dressed and coming here is a big achievement,\u201d she says. \u201cThey want outcomes, they want results, they want little boxes ticked.\u201d But Jones stands as proof of what schemes such as this can produce. Having stabilised her life, she now volunteers at the centre. She\u2019s not alone: it has often been former service users themselves who helped to keep the project running. \u201cIt\u2019s people that have been there, done it and got the T-shirt,\u201d says Richards, pointing proudly at Jones . \u201cShe\u2019s brilliant at helping people because she\u2019s been there. She\u2019s been at rock bottom.\u201d The project may offer a lesson as to how to rebuild the dignity of the south Wales valleys. People can be knocked down by the sweep of powerful economic forces, but solidarity and compassion can help them back to their feet. \u201cAnother lady [who came to us] \u2013 two years ago she had planned how she was going to kill herself, wasn\u2019t going to tell anyone,\u201d Richards tells me as I leave the Brynmawr community centre and head back to the relative prosperity of Bristol, just 50 miles away. \u201cShe\u2019s now got three jobs in a school.\u201d Hired: Six Months Undercover in Low-Wage Britain (Atlantic Books) by James Bloodworth is available to pre-order If you have experiences relating to this article that you\u2019d like to share, please email us at inequality.project@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
