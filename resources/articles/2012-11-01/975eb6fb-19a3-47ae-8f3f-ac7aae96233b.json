A battle-scarred professional training a long lens on Wayne Rooney across a Premier League ground? That's only a tiny bit of it. While a handful of events are restricted to an inner circle with press passes, most can be enjoyed by anyone with a passion for the subject. Every week, thousands of matches and races will welcome you with open arms, often in spectacular surroundings. All it takes to find them is a little online research or a flick through your local listings magazines. Find a story to tell Above all, a good photograph tells a story. Sometimes that means when you are framing it you should try to remove any distractions or irrelevancies. I often see amateur photographs and think: What's that there in the background? Why has he done it like that? But just as often it's about getting everything in. The Mo Farah photo (main image) shows him winning his second gold at the London Olympics. This was one of those moments when the whole country was behind a sportsperson. While I couldn't be sure Farah would win, I wanted to capture the emotion if he did. So I set up a remote camera low down, and used a wide angle that would capture the crowd in the stadium celebrating. It's not just a picture of an athlete winning a race \u2013 it's the British public cheering on a guy called Mohamed who was born in Somalia. Know the rules The key to sports photography is preparation. As a failed sportsman, I prepare for an assignment in the same way as I would for a match. You get one chance to get it right and then it's gone. That can be scary, but it's also thrilling. You need to know the sport you are covering: its rules, its personalities and its rhythms. Ideally, start out with something that you love, follow or even play. This will help you to know when and where the best shots can be found (such as near the goal or at the finishing line) and who you should be concentrating on. You will know that a one\u2011day cricket match will probably start gently, but heat up as the final runs are scored; or that since footballer X and footballer Y have clashed in the past, you're likely to see fireworks when they meet again. If you've really done your research, you'll know not only that footballer Z has a good chance of scoring, but which foot he will shoot with, so you can position yourself appropriately. You'll also know where the light will fall at certain times of the day. For this image of Rafael Nadal (above), I knew that he was left-handed and that if he happened to jump into this fleeting patch of early-evening light, he'd be lit up by the sun. If he were right-handed, he would have been looking the other way and this shot wouldn't have worked. You won't get it right every time, but sometimes you will put yourself in a place where the luck can happen for you. The bare essentials There are times when expensive equipment is essential \u2013 a photographer covering a Premier League match may need several long lenses each costing thousands of pounds, each on a camera body worth almost as much \u2013 but these are few and far between. When I was learning to be a photographer, the college made me use one camera and a 50mm lens for a whole year, to teach me how to work around a subject, rather than rely on equipment. You don't need a bazooka-like lens to cover five-a-side in your local park, or even to photograph the Tour de France as the peloton passes within a few metres of you (above). All you need is a camera that lets you play with basic settings such as shutter speed and aperture. You can only achieve \u2013 and learn \u2013 so much when everything is automatic. If you must splash out, spend a few quid on waterproofing yourself and your kit. An awful lot of sport takes place outdoors and in pouring rain, and this is also when some of the most dramatic shots can be found, such as this rugby player in the mud (left); don't let the weather keep you away. Electronic gadgets don't like the wet. One of my key pieces of equipment is a chamois leather that I bought to wrap around my camera. Creating drama I see a lot of photos that are technically OK \u2013 correctly exposed, in focus and so on \u2013 but unexciting. How can you inject more drama? Rather than shooting everything from eye level, try lowering yourself for a worm's eye view, or raising yourself high above the action. The key is to show things from an unusual angle. For the photo of Tom Daley at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing (above), I realised that if I could shoot him from above, I could get a beautiful picture of his face as he spun against the vivid blue pool. So I got permission to be strapped to a girder in the roof. I don't have a great head for heights, so I don't like to think about it too much \u2026 Combine a novel angle with strong lighting and you can transform the most unpromising scenes. Indoors, you can make harsh floodlights work for you; outside, you can do the same with the sun. Tiger Woods would seem a lot less striking if I hadn't shot him from below, silhouetted against the sky (left). Work the crowd So far we've been talking about sport as if it was only the match or race itself that counts. But if you want to capture atmosphere, don't forget the competitors as they warm up or cool down \u2013 or indeed the spectators. There are some really nice pictures to be taken on the periphery of events, as these racegoers at Cheltenham show (above). Again, you don't need an expensive camera or a long lens; you just have to wander round. Readers' assignment For this assignment, create an impression of speed, perhaps by using a fast shutter speed to freeze the action, or a slower one to accentuate motion. For this image of a gymnast (left), I chose a shutter speed that would keep her body fixed, but make the legs look like the wings of a butterfly. Decide what you're hoping to achieve before you shoot, then select the appropriate settings. With trial and error you should be able to capture some interesting results.
