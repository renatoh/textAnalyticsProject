The lawyers will work alongside the new Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) - labelled the UK's FBI - to put organised criminals \"out of circulation\", Lord Goldsmith said. They will work with the agency's staff from the start of an investigation through to presenting the case in court and will be responsible for implementing new powers aimed at convicting previously \"untouchable\" criminal figures. Under the serious organised crime and police bill, the prosecutors will be able to issue disclosure notices compelling people to answer questions if they have information that could be valuable to an investigation. They will also be able to offer suspects immunity from prosecution or a reduced sentence if they cooperate with investigators or testify against their partners in crime. The director of public prosecutions, Ken Macdonald QC, said the specialist prosecutors would be the primary \"case builders\" and insisted they must abandon \"timidity\" and \"wield every new weapon\" available. He said they would also provide specialist legal services to Soca in areas such as extradition, obtaining evidence from abroad, recovering criminals' assets and witness protection. Soca is due to begin work in April next year with a 5,000-strong staff and a brief to crack down on drug gangs, people traffickers, major fraudsters and internet paedophiles. Chaired by the former MI5 chief Sir Stephen Lander, it will replace the National Crime Squad, the National Criminal Intelligence Service and the Customs and Immigration Service investigation teams. The Home Office has described the creation of Soca as the largest shake-up in British police organisation for 40 years. Today Lord Goldsmith said prosecutors were a \"vital part\" of the government's new strategy to combat organised crime which, he said, cost the UK \u00a320bn a year. \"We want to make the UK one of the least attractive locations in the world for organised crime to operate,\" he said. \"Prosecution is a vital part of our strategy. It is the way to put criminals out of circulation for a long time and confiscate their assets. Above all, prosecution is the way to increase the personal risk for criminals, especially the criminal kingpins.\" The new group of lawyers will be drawn from the existing ranks of prosecutors and from trial lawyers in private practice. They will be based within the crown prosecution service and the revenue and customs prosecution office. Mr Macdonald said: \"Organised criminals, alongside terrorists, pose the greatest current challenge to law enforcement agencies, prosecutors and the wider criminal justice system ... [They] are resourceful, well-financed and innovative in their exploitation of new opportunities, new criminal markets and new technologies\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
