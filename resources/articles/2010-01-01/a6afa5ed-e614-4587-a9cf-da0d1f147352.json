After Cameron Jerome had given the Blues a first-half lead, United needed a disputed own goal from Scott Dann to avert what would have been their fourth defeat in the past seven matches. Sir Alex Ferguson regarded the result as \"not a bad point\", and complained only about the 84th-minute dismissal of Darren Fletcher, who was sent off for his second yellow card offence after a foul on Jerome. No United match would be complete without a Fergie rant, and this time the old curmudgeon said: \"I've not seen such a soft sending off for a long time. It was absolutely ridiculous. I watched Mark Clattenburg referee Arsenal v Spurs, and you had to hit somebody with an axe to get booked in that game.\" A more rational verdict came from Fletcher himself; he felt he had let down his team. Ferguson's remarks could lead to a misconduct charge from the Football Association. The United manager has a two-game suspended ban relating to comments he made about the fitness of the referee Alan Wiley in October. He added that there were \"some wonderful and weird decisions out there\". Birmingham, the biggest club never to have won the league, are about as fashionable as brown ale and tend to go flat just as quickly. But there is no sign of their bubble bursting and it would hardly be a surprise if they extended a historic run at home to Nottingham Forest in their FA Cup replay on Tuesday, and again against the basket case that is Portsmouth on Saturday. This match had considerable significance for both teams. Birmingham were keen to maintain their extraordinary bid for a place in Europe, while United needed to buttress form that had been damaged by successive defeats at the fortress they call Old Trafford. Both managers made their priorities clear last weekend, when they rested key players in the FA Cup. There was no question of that here, and their respective line-ups were at full strength. Some called this the acid test for Birmingham's potential, but they have undergone more of those than litmus recently. Their spiky defence held Chelsea goalless on Boxing Day, did the same against Manchester City and have conceded just five goals in the past 10 games. If injuries continue to deprive England of centre-halves, Fabio Capello could do worse than take a look at Roger Johnson, the Blues' only ever-present this season. A body-on-the-line defender in the John Terry mould, Johnson has been consistently outstanding since his cheap-as-chips transfer from Cardiff, where he was a key figure in their run to the FA Cup final in 2008. Kevin Keegan, who knows what it takes to play international football, described his performance to ESPN viewers last night as \"sensational\". As might have been expected, United made all the running in the first half, but Birmingham were resolution personified and the first attack of consequence was delayed until the 24th minute, when Liam Ridgewell carelessly conceded possession and Antonio Valencia's through pass left Wayne Rooney one-on-one with Joe Hart on the edge of the six-yard box. The England striker would normally be the odds-on favourite in such situations, but Hart is playing as well as any goalkeeper in the league these days and improvised an important save with his feet. Birmingham were backs to the wall, tackling and blocking as if their lives depended on it, but their indefatigable spirit had its reward in the 39th minute, when James McFadden's corner from the right brought a poor attempt at a headed clearance from Jonny Evans, enabling Lee Bowyer to supply Jerome, who thumped it home at whites-of-the-eyes range. The goal was yet another reminder that Evans and Wes Brown are not centre-halves of title-winning calibre, and that not until Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic are back, and at their best, are United likely to keep clean sheets with regularity. Confidence coursing, Birmingham contributed more as an attacking force after the interval, but Jerome wasted a promising opening with a poor final ball and United drew level in the same minute \u2013 the 63rd \u2013 in circumstances that sparked pandemonium. Patrice Evra's shot from left to right was diverted in by Dann, who thought Rooney was closer behind him than was the case. Birmingham appealed for offside and the referee's assistant flagged in agreement, only to be overruled because it had been the defender's decisive contact. McLeish had no complaints after studying a video replay, which showed that Ridgewell had played Rooney onside anyway. The Birmingham manager, who confirmed the midfielder Michel is set to join from Sporting Gijon, praised his players for their resilience, determination and application, adding: \"They've shown those qualities all season and this time you can add ability to that. They can be utterly proud of what they have done so far.\" Ferguson agreed and said of the protege who played for him at Aberdeen and for Scotland at the 1986 World Cup: \"Alex has done a fantastic job. He had players running a hundred miles for him tonight, and he has to take great credit for that.\" THE FANS' PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT Jon Berry, BluesinLondon@yahoogroups.co.uk This was magnificent, absolutely awesome. We defended as if our lives depended on it. Man United always plays square passes across the box with Scholes or Rooney ready to smash it in. But our players put their bodies in front of everything and we had our chances too. Hart has been getting all the plaudits but it was Kuszczak who had to make the most saves. McLeish has organised this team brilliantly. In the 50 years I've been watching, this is the most committed Blues team I have ever seen. The fan's player ratings Hart 8; Carr 8, R Johnson 9, Dann 7, Ridgewell 7; Larsson 7 (Fahey 83 n/a), Ferguson 9, Bowyer 8, McFadden 7; Jerome 7, Ben\u00edtez 7 Steve O'Donnell, Observer reader This was not a great show. Our performances have steadily deteriorated since we beat Arsenal in the Champions League semi-final last season. Today we lacked consistency and a cutting edge. We don't seem to have any quality in the middle of the park even though we had loads of possession. Carrick keeps going missing when we really need some incisive passing. I don't think we are going to improve if we don't get Van de Sar, Vidic and Rio back. And I'm praying for Hargreaves to get fit. The fan's player ratings Kuszczak 7; R da Silva 7, Brown 6, Evans 6, Evra 7; Scholes 6 (Diouf 81 n/a); Valencia 6, Fletcher 7, Carrick 5, Park 5 (Giggs 66 6); Rooney 6 TO TAKE PART IN THE FANS' VERDICT, EMAIL FANS.PREMIER@OBSERVER.CO.UK"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
