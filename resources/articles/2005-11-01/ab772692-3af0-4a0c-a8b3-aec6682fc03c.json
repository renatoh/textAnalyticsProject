It's sweet, sticky, spicy and gooey. I use wholemeal flour and rapadura brown sugar, which you can get from good healthfood shops, because of their lower GI (as well as wonderful flavour), then go and spoil it all with the lemon icing ... Ah well. Use a classic cream cheese frosting if you prefer. 225g grated carrots 125g raisins 6 tbsp olive oil 125g soft brown sugar, preferably rapadura 225g wholemeal flour 2 tsp baking powder 1 tsp grated nutmeg 1 tsp powdered cinnamon 8 tbsp real maple syrup 4 tbsp fresh orange juice For the icing: 175g icing sugar Juice and rind of 1 lemon Preheat the oven to 170C/325F/gas mark 3 and line an 18cm cake tin with nonstick paper. Mix the carrots, raisins, oil and sugar in a bowl, then add the flour, baking powder, nutmeg, cinnamon, maple syrup and orange juice, and mix until everything is well combined - it will be quite sticky. Spoon into the prepared tin, level the top, and bake for an hour and a quarter, or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Leave to cool in the tin. Mix the icing sugar with the lemon rind and enough of the juice (about six to eight teaspoons) to make a thick coating consistency. Spread over the top of the cake and leave to set."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
