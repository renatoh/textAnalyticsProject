The selectors included four spinners among the 27 players for the upcoming international summer. The Test pairing of Graeme Swann and James Tredwell are in, as are the Sussex captain Mike Yardy and Yorkshire's young leg\u2011spinner Adil Rashid. Panesar has slipped a long way in the order since he last played for England, the first Ashes Test in July. Panesar, 27, has made a sound start to the season with his new county, Sussex. But after enduring a dismal 2009 he still has a way to go to recapture the selectors' attention. \"He's very done well even though he has only had these early-season wickets to bowl on,\" said his new coach, Mark Robinson. \"He bowled really well in Cardiff against Glamorgan, where there was a little bit of turn in the wicket, especially in the first innings. He was spinning it quite nicely and he got back to that pace where he hurries players on the front foot. That's the old Monty. And I think we have got to get back to the old Monty.\" Hamsphire's Michael Lumb is the only uncapped player to make the cut. Like Yardy he had already been included in the England squad for the World Twenty20. Otherwise the majority of the names toured with England at one point or another in the winter. The only man to be demoted is Surrey's Steven Davies, bumped out of the squad by the emergence of Craig Kieswetter in Bangladesh. Three places have been left vacant, allowing for a degree of flexibility in selection as the summer wears on. \"We were delighted with the progress made by several younger players such as Craig Kieswetter, Steven Finn and Ajmal Shahzad over the winter,\" said the national selector Geoff Miller. \"James Tredwell and Michael Carberry have previously experienced the England set-up after making an impact at international level during the winter, and similarly Joe Denly and Liam Plunkett firmly remain in our plans over the course of the summer.\" Owais Shah retains his incremental contract, which will offer him some solace after he was not included in England's Twenty20 squad for the Caribbean. Full contract James Anderson (Lancs), Ian Bell (Warks), Stuart Broad (Notts), Paul Collingwood (Durham), Alastair Cook (Essex), Graham Onions (Durham), Kevin Pietersen (Hampshire), Matthew Prior (Sussex), Andrew Strauss (Middlesex), Ryan Sidebottom, Graeme Swann (both Notts). Incremental Ravi Bopara (Essex), Tim Bresnan (Yorkshire), Eoin Morgan (Middlesex), Adil Rashid (Yorkshire), Owais Shah (Middlesex), Jonathan Trott (Warks), Luke Wright (Sussex). No contract Michael Carberry (Hampshire), Joe Denly (Kent), Steven Finn (Middlesex), Craig Kieswetter (Somerset), Michael Lumb (Hampshire), Liam Plunkett (Durham), Ajmal Shazad (Yorkshire), James Tredwell (Kent), Michael Yardy (Sussex)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
