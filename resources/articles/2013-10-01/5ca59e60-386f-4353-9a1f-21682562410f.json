Historian Bernard Lewis thinks that the dichotomy between Iranian moderates and extremists is false. A more accurate description, he maintains, is between pragmatists and ideologues, between those who find it necessary to make compromises in power and those who maintain the pure doctrine of the revolution. How would America's Grand Old Party fare under the same analysis? After all, Republican leaders have complained that Barack Obama was more interested in talking to Iran than to them about the budget. The comparison between Iran and the GOP might be closer than they think. The GOP ideologues are those who refuse to see their attempts to repeal or delay the Affordable Care Act as an unwinnable fight. Why do it, then? \"Because we're right, simply because we're right,\" says Steve King, the representative from Iowa. As hundreds of thousands of civilian employees began to be laid off yesterday, the pragmatists are those Republicans who believe they are about to sign the biggest suicide note in their party's history. To bring federal government to its knees for the first time in 17 years is one matter. If the disruption is short, it can be tolerated. Judging by yesterday's rise on Wall Street, investors are betting that Washington will soon find a compromise. But to threaten a fragile economic recovery is quite another matter. Even the partial suspension of government should be seen as a taster of the political paralysis that may be to come. The opinion of the credit-rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's is worth quoting here: \"This sort of political brinkmanship is the dominant reason the [US government's] rating is no longer 'AAA',\". It is part of the Tea Party's credo to treat the launch of health insurance subsidies as a groundbreaking development that will change the nature of politics, creating a new class of entitlement addicts. But for anyone else in the party who places strategy above the glory of the fight, the purity of the cause, this week must be profoundly disturbing. They are in the firing line more than anyone else. Barack Obama has not repeated the mistake he made in 2011, in thinking he can reach a grand bargain and producing instead a series of automatic spending cuts. This time, he has called the GOP's bluff and let federal government grind to a halt. Yesterday was also the first time web-based marketplaces for uninsured Americans went live. Mr Obama should make much of the comparison between change and obstructionism. Fear of the chaos that would ensue if the debt ceiling is not raised before 17 October and the government defaults is the biggest weapon in Mr Obama's armoury. He should use it, unblinkingly."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
