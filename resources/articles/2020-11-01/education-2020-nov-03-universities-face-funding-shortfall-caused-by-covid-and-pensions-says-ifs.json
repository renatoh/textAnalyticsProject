The IFS annual report on education spending says there will be funding shortfalls in colleges and universities, where the pension deficit has increased from \u00a33.6bn in March 2018 to an estimated \u00a321.5bn last August. Researchers say there will be mounting long-term costs for the government, with a predicted \u00a312bn shortfall in student loan repayments as graduates struggle to find work in a labour market devastated by the pandemic. For universities, there are likely to be additional losses from accommodation, conferences and catering. Ben Waltmann, an IFS research economist and a co-author of the report, said the number of students entering higher education had held up better than expected this summer, but said universities still face financial shortfalls from no-shows or higher than usual drop-out rates. \u201cBy far the biggest source of risk now appears to be the large deficit on the main university pension scheme which has increased from \u00a33.6bn in March 2018 to a monumental \u00a321.5bn in August 2020, according to the latest preliminary estimate,\u201d he said. \u201cWith contributions already at more than 30% of earnings, it is hard to see how a deficit on this scale, if confirmed, could be evened out without further cuts in the generosity of the scheme.\u201d Disputes over the pension scheme have already triggered prolonged and widespread strike action on campuses. According to the IFS, reduced interest rates and depressed rates of return will cost universities an additional \u00a38bn to meet existing pension promises, double the previous estimate by the IFS. The report also highlights financial problems in further education (FE) \u2013 which the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, has made a priority \u2013 as well as sixth-form colleges, where large increases in student numbers due to improved GCSE results this summer are likely to lead to a fall in real-terms funding for each student, despite \u00a3400m in additional funding this year. IFS analysis of state-school funding, which was published in September, showed schools in England suffered their worst decline in funding since the 1980s, with secondary schools and those in the most deprived areas hit the hardest. The decline was so deep, the IFS said, the additional \u00a37bn pledged by the government would not be enough to reverse the cuts by 2023, leaving school spending 1% lower than in 2009-10. On college and sixth-form funding, Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \u201cThe government talks about the importance of further education, but simply doesn\u2019t put its money where its mouth is, as this report starkly shows. \u201cThe additional investment of \u00a3400m into the sector this year hardly touches the sides following years of real-terms cuts and the likelihood of rising student numbers. Colleges and sixth forms urgently require a significant uplift in funding that matches the government\u2019s rhetoric.\u201d David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, added: \u201cWith the spending review just weeks away and the FE white paper shortly after that, there is real opportunity to put college funding back to the level it should be, to not only improve opportunities for young people and adults but also to help build the resilience and financial security of colleges to face up to what is undoubtedly the toughest year on record.\u201d The University and College Union general secretary, Jo Grady, said: \u201cThe government urgently needs to address the continuing uncertainty about higher and further education funding, after years of underfunding and marketisation which have been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic and its economic consequences.\u201d A government spokesperson said: \u201cWe understand this has been a challenging time for the education sector which is why we introduced a range of support to help colleges and universities manage their finances and safeguard students. \u201cWe have protected grant funding for further education, worth over \u00a33bn for a full year, and increased education and training investment this year for 16-19 year-olds by an additional \u00a3400m. \u201cWe also brought forward over \u00a32bn worth of tuition fee payments for universities, and announced a major package of \u00a3280m to stabilise research funding.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
