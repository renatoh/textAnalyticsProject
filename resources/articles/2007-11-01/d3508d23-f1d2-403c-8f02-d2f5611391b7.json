Fittingly, the first such summit was in 1975, months after the world's first oil-price shock. Today, the world faces another price shock. Analysts predict that prices - trading at around $96 a barrel on Friday - will breach the $100 mark within days. The all-time record price of $101.70 (adjusted for inflation) in 1979 is within touching distance. But, decades after the West swore never again to be held to ransom by Middle East producers, we have never been more dependent on Opec. Last week, the International Energy Agency said there was enough oil to go around - provided the cartel could almost double production over the next 25 years. In its annual global outlook - which gets gloomier by the year - the IEA said that if Opec stumps up the cash, its production will grow from 36mbpd (million barrels per day) last year to 46mbpd in 2015, and 61mbpd by 2030. This would see the cartel's share of global production jump from 42 per cent now to 52 per cent by 2030. Analysts forecast that supply from non-Opec countries will remain steady over the next 20 years at just under 50mbpd, with small increases coming from non-conventional oil such as biofuels. This puts the onus on Opec to meet almost the entire forecast 37 per cent, or 32mbpd, increase in demand by 2030. But there is no guarantee that this extra production will come on stream as predicted. Opec estimates that $2.4 trillion will have to be spent globally to meet production targets. Much of this will have to be borne by the cartel. But it admits that its own estimates of how much it will have to spend between now and 2010 alone vary by as much as $50bn. The range of uncertainty in spending estimates increases to $140bn by 2015. These wild variations are hardly reassuring. In some ways you can't blame Opec for procrastinating. Prices may seem to be on a relentless march upwards, but in the late 1990s they were in the low teens. If the cartel invests billions in raising capacity just as the world goes into recession and demand falls off a cliff, it could bankrupt its members. Kevin Norrish, commodities analyst at Barclays Capital, says: 'If you're a minister in an Opec country contemplating a huge investment to increase production, you'll remember the 1990s, when Opec had 8mbpd of unused capacity at times. That will make you cautious.' The cartel is also under less political pressure than in the past to keep a lid on prices. As manufacturing has declined in developed countries, their economies have become less dependent on oil and more immune to high prices. Julian Lee from the Centre for Global Energy Studies says that in Europe, high oil prices fit governments' environmental agendas, while the US is trying to develop its own alternatives to oil such as biofuels. 'What has surprised me is the lack of real political pressure. Governments are quietly not unhappy to see prices go up, so long as that doesn't have a detrimental impact on their economies.' And if the West is not leaning on Opec, particularly Saudi Arabia, to increase production, it is easier for the cartel to delay investment in new capacity. Some analysts say Saudi Arabia, for example, already has a tendency to be over-optimistic about how much oil it will pump. Its official target is 12.5mbpd by 2009, but Patrick Gibson, from energy research company Wood Mackenzie, reckons it won't hit this target until 2012. Of course, accurately estimating production and consumption over 10 years - let alone beyond - is a very difficult game. The IEA could be wrong and new production from Opec may not be necessary to fill an energy gap. But this is unlikely, not least because the IEA has consistently been over-optimistic about oil demand and supply. Barclays Capital last week noted how 'dark and Shakespearean' the mood of the IEA outlook report was. 'We are not quite yet into full-blown King Lear territory,' the bank's research note said, 'but the latest is certainly up to Richard III's levels of despair and foreboding.' Vanessa Rossi from Oxford Economics agrees that global energy forecasts, such as the IEA's, have been too cautious. She argues that they have underestimated demand from rapidly developing countries such as India and China, which have accounted for 70 per cent of the additional demand for energy in the past two years. 'There's a huge question mark over how energy demand can be met over 10 to 20 years,' she says. 'You can't just assume this away. We can't stick our heads in the sand like ostriches, optimistically forecasting that demand will turn out conveniently weaker so we can meet low supply projections.' So if you think oil prices are high now, the message is: you ain't seen nothing yet - whatever platitudes Opec utters this week. Looming shadow: Power shortages to wreak havoc 'Are you trying to get me shot,' asks Steve Holliday, chief executive of National Grid. He is joking. Sort of. Asking utility bosses what they think of the government's energy policy usually elicits a sharp intake of breath. Holliday, who announces his first interim results this week since taking over in January, is no different. Asked to give Whitehall marks out of 10, he awards a non-controversial but could-do-better seven. You can't blame him for being twitchy. After all, National Grid - which operates the UK's electricity and gas transmission systems - is right in the front line if the lights go out. Every winter, we fret that there won't be enough power to meet demand, and last month National Grid issued two warnings that power stations were not generating enough electricity. But while this may hit the headlines, another power crisis - one that will most affect the developing world - is looming. By 2015, says energy analyst Platts, the number of power stations over 40 years old - the age at which they start to get increasingly unreliable - will more than double to over one quarter of the world's total capacity. The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that between 2004 and 2015, global demand for electricity will increase by 3.3 per cent a year. To replace ageing plants as well as meet this demand, analysts forecast that the amount of new capacity being built would have to almost double over the next decade. And some economists argue that the IEA's estimate is too low. According to Oxford Economics, demand for power will grow at just under 5 per cent a year between 2005 and 2015 because of the huge appetite for power in rapidly developing countries like China. Rupert Soames, chief executive of electricity provider Aggreko, says: 'We have a combination of pent-up demand and under-investment while we are also approaching a big replacement cycle.' He believes the developing world will bear the brunt of resulting shortages. Manufacturers of solar-power generators say renewable energy can help fill the gap in the developing world. Paul Norrish, sales director of G24i, which makes mobile solar generating devices, believes solar power will become economically competitive by 2012-15. But this depends on oil and electricity prices staying high and the surge in production of solar cells maintaining momentum. Soames says: 'For the next five to 10 years the world will be suffering from serious power shortages. When they run short of power, economic development will run short, too.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
