Amid growing scepticism over the intelligence behind the lethal strike against Qassem Suleimani, the US president and Iranian officials hurled increasingly dire warnings at each other. Opponents cautioned that if Donald Trump carries out a tweeted threat to attack dozens of Iranian sites including non-military cultural targets, he would be guilty of a war crime. The president went to his golf course in Florida and left secretary of state Mike Pompeo to defend the assertion that the drone strike against Suleimani in Baghdad prevented an imminent attack on US interests. \u201cWe would have been culpably negligent had we not taken this action,\u201d Pompeo said on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press. \u201cThe American people would have said that we weren\u2019t doing the right thing to protect and defend American lives. President Trump has been crystal clear.\u201d The secretary went on the claim that \u201cthere were in fact plots that [Suleimani] was working on that were aimed directly at significant harm to American interests throughout the region, not just in Iraq\u201d. But he was unable to provide specifics. When host Chuck Todd asked if retaliation against US citizens should now be expected, Pompeo admitted: \u201cIt may be that there\u2019s a little noise here in the interim.\u201d It was a remark that could come to be seen as flippant if American lives are lost. Suleimani, Iran\u2019s top military commander held responsible for thousands of deaths, was killed on Friday in a drone strike at Baghdad airport, a stunning attack analysts said brought the US and Iran closer to war than at any point in the past 40 years. Critics fear Trump has opened Pandora\u2019s box. On Sunday the Iraqi parliament passed a resolution calling on the government to expel US troops. Around 5,000 remain in Iraq, most in an advisory capacity. Wendy Sherman, a former under secretary of state for political affairs, tweeted: \u201cThe Iraqi parliament vote to expel US troops is a major win for Iran. Just one piece of fallout against our interests by [Donald Trump\u2019s] decisions.\u201d Iran also announced it would no longer meet its commitments under the international nuclear deal Trump left in 2018. US media reports have suggested that the evidence Suleimani was plotting an attack was circumstantial at best and that a strike was among several options presented to Trump that few expected him to take. Pompeo, however, insisted the action \u2013 taken without congressional authorisation \u2013 was both lawful and necessary. On ABC\u2019s This Week, he said there had been \u201cno scepticism\u201d among senior leaders. \u201cThe intelligence assessment made clear that no action \u2013 allowing Suleimani to continue his plotting, his planning, his terror campaign \u2013 created more risks than taking the action that we took last week. We reduced risks.\u201d Pompeo was pressed on CNN\u2019s State of the Union about how \u201cimminent\u201d the attacks were. \u201cIf you\u2019re an American in the region, days and weeks \u2013 this is not something that\u2019s relevant,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to prepare, we have to be ready, and we took a bad guy off the battlefield.\u201d Democrats seized on the lack of details. Pete Buttigieg, a military veteran and candidate for president, told CNN: \u201cThe secretary of state just now, when asked whether this strike prevented directly an attack, he did not prove, he did not demonstrate, he did not even claim that the answer was yes.\u201d Buttigieg added: \u201cNow, let\u2019s be clear \u2013 Qassem Suleimani was a bad figure. He has American blood on his hands. None of us should shed a tear for his death. But just because he deserved it doesn\u2019t mean it was the right strategic move. This is about consequences.\u201d The jarring intervention by Trump \u2013 who is facing an impeachment trial and tough re-election campaign \u2013 seemed to fly in the face of his \u201cAmerica first\u201d policy and pledge to pull troops out of the Middle East. After Tehran promised retaliation, Trump threatened to hit 52 sites \u2013 \u201csome at a very high level &amp; important to Iran &amp; the Iranian culture\u201d \u2013 if Iran attacked Americans or US assets. Such an action would almost certainly result in civilian deaths. On Sunday, he followed up with a tweet he claimed was sufficient to notify Congress \u201cthat should Iran strike any US person or target, the United States will quickly &amp; fully strike back, &amp; perhaps in a disproportionate manner.\u201d The word \u201cdisproportionate\u201d was sure to raise alarm. Hossein Dehghan, military adviser to Iran\u2019s supreme leader, told CNN that if Trump went ahead with an attack, \u201che should accept that he is a war criminal and must be tried in a relevant court\u201d. Dehghan warned that Iran\u2019s response to the airstrike \u201cfor sure will be military and against military sites\u201d, adding: \u201cThe only thing that can end this period of war is for the Americans to receive a blow that is equal to the blow they have inflicted. Afterward they should not seek a new cycle.\u201d Iranian information minister Mohammad Javad Azari-Jahromi tweeted: \u201cLike Isis, Like Hitler, Like Genghis! They all hate cultures. Trump is a terrorist in a suit. He will learn history very soon that NOBODY can defeat \u2018the Great Iranian Nation &amp; Culture\u2019.\u201d Targeting cultural sites is a war crime under a 1954 Hague convention. In 2017, the United Nations security council passed unanimously a resolution condemning the destruction of heritage sites. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, a Democrat on the Senate foreign relations committee, tweeted: \u201cTargeting civilians and cultural sites is what terrorists do. It\u2019s a war crime. Trump is stumbling into a war of choice. A war entirely of his making. A war that will get thousands of Americans killed. Congress must stop him.\u201d\ufeff"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
