He got down to work with the coloured blocks, piling them up with his sticky little hands. Finally, inevitably, as he gingerly put the last brick on the top, he brought the whole tower clattering down. In the silence that followed we looked at him across the room. He looked at us, all Pollyanna curls and big blue eyes, before whispering: \u201cFuuuuuck!\u201d In some ways I think this latest Audi is a bit like that final brick. Have we now reached peak SUV? Conventional wisdom in the car business holds that the days of the humble saloon are now numbered. Our long-serving, family-minded, four-door cars are stuck in the slow lane as an endless array of soft-riding sports utility vehicles line up to overtake. The market segment that\u2019s falling fastest is among large luxury saloons as they are replaced by premium SUVs. Brands synonymous with indulgence and narcissism are all getting in on the SUV act. Bentley, Maserati, Lamborghini, Rolls-Royce and even, soon, Ferrari have all recently added huge 4x4s to their team sheets. They\u2019re following the lead of the SUV game-changers created by the likes of Volvo, BMW, Mercedes, Jaguar, Porsche and, of course, Audi. But Audi already has the whoppingly swanky Q7. So why should insatiable SUV fans have to be tempted to step up to the Audi Q8? (Or as my neighbour misheard a \u201cSaudi Kuwait!\u201d) It is an even more overwhelmingly accomplished car. In any colour (and particularly in Dragon Orange) it\u2019s a look-at-me-me-me-me motor. It\u2019s super-slick, beefy and intimidating. I can\u2019t decide whether it looks pretty thuggish or thuggishly pretty. The Q8 showcases all the brand\u2019s latest tech: from the all-conquering all-wheel drive system to the air suspension and the silky eight-speed automatic gearbox. It comes in a choice of three power units: a 3-litre diesel TDI with either 286bhp or 231bhp or a V6 petrol TSI with 340bhp. Its multi-screen \u201cVirtual Cockpit\u201d means you have information coming at you from three screens, and there are 39 different driver-assistance systems available at the push of one of its many buttons. It delivers a level of smart innovation you won\u2019t have encountered before and it seems there is nothing the Q8 will not do to make you feel safer and more comfortable. So why does it make me feel so uncomfortable? You can\u2019t fault its performance, and its fuel economy is remarkable \u2013 especially for such a big car. It feels nimble about town and on long hauls ticks off miles as if idly flicking through the pages of a beach novel. But the Q8 feels excessive. Like the saloons it\u2019s replacing it is still just a four-door five-seater \u2013 but massively reimagined. In our resource-starved world, it\u2019s not a car that any of us actually needs or should want. But as Oscar Wilde said: \u201cNothing succeeds like excess.\u201d Email Martin at martin.love@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter@MartinLove166"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
