But the Irishman recovered rapidly enough to insist last night that he would try to race today, subject to medical approval. His great rival Dettori completed a treble on the day and moved 13 winners clear with 24 racing days to go, although he will miss about seven days towards the end of the month when he goes to ride in the US and Australia. Fallon, chasing his seventh championship, was riding Maritima, an unraced two-year-old filly, over seven furlongs when he was unseated just over a furlong from home. He was then trampled by Bowled Out, who had been running too close behind to avoid the jockey. After an examination by the course doctor Fallon was taken to Leicester Royal Infirmary. He was released last night after tests and will try to make an immediate return to racing at Leicester today, claiming that his pursuit of the title, though damaged, is not yet over. \"I hurt my lower back, shoulder and head, but it's just bruising and I'm fine,\" he said. \"I've got rides tomorrow so I'll be there, though I'll have to pass the course doctor. My thoughts on the title aren't positive but I am still going to bat on. You never know.\" The stewards held an inquiry into the mishap and decided it had been the result of accidental interference involving two other runners. Saywaan, ridden by Dettori, won the race.
