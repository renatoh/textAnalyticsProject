Warwick, noting that he also believed McNish could have enjoyed a successful career in F1 if he had been given a longer stint at the wheel, said: \"He is one of our greatest drivers ever.\" McNish and his team-mates, Tom Kristensen and Lo\u00efc Duval, secured the championship with a third place finish at the Shanghai International Circuit, with one race of the season to go, after three wins and three second places had put them in a dominant position at the top of the table. The British driver has won motor racing's ultimate test, the 24 Hours of Le Mans, three times, the American Le Mans Series three times \u2013 the latter all with Audi \u2013 has had four victories on the demanding track at the 12 Hours of Sebring and won multiple kart titles. In F1 he tested for McLaren and Benetton and raced for Toyota in 2002 before continuing his already successful career in sportscars. \"I thought it was a shame that Toyota dropped him,\" said Warwick, who was the last British driver to hold the World Sportscar Championship drivers' title, winning it in 1992. \"I think he was just getting into his stride and he would have been a great Formula One driver.\" He believed McNish's achievements, despite that disappointment, remained deserving of recognition. \"Allan will go down as one of the greatest sportscar drivers ever,\" he said. \"I don't have much memorabilia around my house but I do have my world championship medal and I have my Le Mans trophy from 1992. I am very proud to have been champion and to have won Le Mans and Allan has surpassed me in terms of winning there several times and now he is world champion. I am going to be very proud to give him a prize at our awards in December.\" McNish, equally, was also happy to acknowledge that Warwick had an influence early in his career. \"Derek was a name when I was coming up through karting,\" he said. \"I got to know him in my junior formulas and he was very helpful in giving words of advice. He gave me pointers of things to do and things not to do. The title has been a long time coming from a British point of view but to follow on from Martin [Brundle, world sportscar champion in 1988] and then Derek \u2013 it's not a bad line-up.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
