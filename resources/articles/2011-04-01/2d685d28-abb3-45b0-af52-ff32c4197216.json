You quote the Active People survey but do not mention the Taking Part survey, also funded by Sport England and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Even more strange is that Sport England does not have any information on the Taking Part survey on its website. Could this be because Taking Part shows a very different picture? This survey shows an increase in 3x30min participation per week of 1.5 million since 2007-08 (compared with next to no increase shown by the Active People survey). A remarkable increase if true and, who knows, maybe due in part to the money invested by the previous government. So which survey is correct? Taking Part uses a proper randomised, stratified sample of households visited by trained interviewers. Active People uses random digit dialling of landlines with phone interview. Random dialling of landlines does not sample much of the population who now use mobile phones. Also this profile is rapidly changing. I believe the Taking Part data is accurate, which brings us back to an interesting question. Why is Sport England so embarrassed by its success? Cuddling up to the new coalition government, perhaps?
