Some things never change. At the start of the season, Peter Reid stood on the Stadium of Light touchline looking dazed and confused. At one point, he became so befuddled that he was unable to perform the tricky shove-five-sticks-of-gum-into-slavering-mouth-and-not-fall-over multitasking combo without the aid of a strong headwind and both ears fully extended. Inevitably, Reidy was sacked and sent off to pester Gary Lineker. Meanwhile, to popular acclaim in Newcastle, Howard Wilkinson took over. Wilko stood on the Stadium of Light touchline looking dazed and confused for fully five months, before being ushered away by a carer. As a result, we're now led to believe Mick McCarthy will be taking over. So will he be seen standing on the Stadium of Light touchline looking dazed and confused? Listen, Mick wrote the book on standing around looking dazed and confused. It's called Mick McCarthy's World Cup Diary. But not everyone shares the Fiver's concern. \"I have got a lot of respect for Mick as a man and as a manager and I have always said that,\" said Roy, hold on, Robbie Keane this morning. \"Mick is like a friend now as well, not just a manager I worked with. He is one of these blokes I feel very comfortable around,\" added Keane, from the safety of his Tottenham home (277.5 miles away from Wearside). \"He will do well wherever he goes and I wish him the best of luck, I really do.\" And the messages of goodwill didn't stop there. \"I still feel optimistic about the future and wish the club and its supporters all the best,\" said Sgt (Rtd) Wilko from the Armed Forces Home. \"I still believe that Sunderland are a club with enormous potential but there's lots of hard work to be done,\" he continued. \"It will take time and there will be difficult and unpleasant decisions to be taken along the way.\" Like sacking another manager, do you think? 3.15 CHELTENHAM: SMURFIT CHAMPION HURDLE Look, you've caught us at a bad time. We've just put \u00a350 on the nose of Hors La Loi III at 16-1 and Intersky Falcon at 9-2 in the Champion Hurdle, and they're at the post. So our mind's not really on the news that Arsenal and Spurs have been given ... hey, they're off. Come on, babies, romp home for daddy! Right, where were we? Ah yes, according to London's London Evening Standard COME ON BOYS the new Sport England chairman is set to COME ON MY LOVELIES allow Spurs and Arsenal DISASTER! to groundshare USELESS HORS DA LOI!!! at Wembley. \"If the clubs IT'S PULLING UP LAME AND IT HASN'T RUN TWO YARDS!!!!! and the Football Association NO WAY THE KIDS ARE GOING TO GO TO COLLEGE NOW are up for it, we are willing to facilitate it,\" Carter said.

QUOTE OF THE DAY \"It is certainly one of the weakest in terms of numbers and it looks a bit thin when you get a few injuries like we have at the moment\" - This is Sir Alex Ferguson, manager of Manchester United, the world's richest club, moaning about the size of his squad.

SMASH MOUTH When Henrik Larsson smashed his jaw into little bits in that clash with Livingston defender Gustavo Bahoken last month, most of his head fell off and his teeth were scattered to the four corners of the pitch. So when the patched-up Swede pitched up for training this week, it was something of a (cue cymbal clash) turnip for the books! But with the (drum roll) carrot of Thursday's match against Liverpool to sharpen his appetite, the 43-goal hero can't wait to start bursting the (gong finale) onion bag once again. \"The jaw fracture has healed now,\" said the striker excitedly, without apparently moving said jaw at all. \"The doctors have cleared me and I am now going to practice at 100%,\" he added, nodding his head unconvincingly like a ventriloquist's dummy to cover up the fact that his new dentures seemed to be glued shut. \"If the manager picks me, I am ready to play,\" he continued, his normal Scandinavian monotone betraying more than a suspicion of Northern Irish sing-song. \"I have done two training sessions and I have not got any reactions so everything feels okay.\" Suddenly from nowhere, Celtic manager Martin O'Neill leap-frogged over Larsson's head. He's so excited about the forthcoming matches that even news of French winger Didier Agathe's twanged hamstring can't stop him bouncing around. In the next 12 days, O'Neill's side play Liverpool twice and Rangers in the Scottish League Cup final. No wonder Larsson is so hungry for action. John Hartson, meanwhile, who is just plain hungry, is apparently next in line for the wired-jaw diet. EARWORMS R US Puppy Love - The Osmonds Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Old Oak Tree - Dawn feat.

Glenn Hoddle has identified Monaco's African striker Shabani Nonda as the answer to Tottenham's attacking problems. The Spurs manager headed for Monte Carlo over the weekend to make a personal check on the Burundi international who could be sold in the summer for around \u00a36m. NEWS IN BRIEF Juan Sebastian Veron-and-off has pledged to stay at Manchester United. \"Six months ago, things were not going as I hoped they would,\" said the goateed one. \"But nowadays I am very happy and I think I will see out my contract with United.\" Leeds United footballer in court shock! Eirik Bakke today denied charges of drink-driving and of driving without both a licence and insurance when he appeared before magistrates. Blackburn defender Stig Inge Bjornebye has announced his retirement after failing to recover from a training-ground accident last April when he fractured an eye socket. \"The will has always been there, but in the end it has not proved realistic,\" he said.

TONIGHT'S TV &amp; RADIO ITV1: Big Cup Live - Arsenal v Roma (7.30pm, highlights 11.15pm) Yesterday Dear Fiver highlighted the tragic case of law student Karolina Mahoney - who not only hates law but, with her exams looming, \"has no job prospects on the horizon\" either. Big Cup Highlights - Internazionale v Newcastle (2.20am) \"I long to go on wild adventures and perhaps find a job abroad,\" she added, like someone who hasn't had all hope extinguished. \"However I am torn as I feel I'm under the obligation to follow Everton wherever they go in Europe next season. What do I do?\" Channel Five: Argentinian Football (3.35am) As usual your advice has flooded in. \"I think I may be able to equip Karolina Mahoney's problem with a potential solution,\" says David Shanks. \"As I understand it, K's priorities include a foreign location, wild adventures, good money, lawlessness, and Everton. Gillette Soccer Special (7.30pm) \"I am about to leave a job and lifestyle that provide all of the above, and I am pleased to inform K that a replacement has still not been found. You're On Sky Sports (10pm &amp; 2am) \"Foreign location: K would be based in Lima, Peru (I have a house on the Pacific seaboard, the roof terrace faces west, good sunsets). Netbusters (11pm) \"Wild adventures: Depending on what she means, the Lima nightlife is 'colourful' and 'caters for all tastes'. Coca (the plant from which cocaine derives) is grown legally in Peru. If it's not urban adventures she's after, the Andes and the Amazon are an hour or two away for white water rafting or swimming with piranhas etc. Football Asia (12am) \"Good money: thanks to the gringo-size pay packet, K could afford to partake in whatever extra-curricular activity that takes her fancy, wherever, whenever she likes. Cigarettes are five times cheaper here compared with the UK. Sky Sports 3: German Football (8pm) \"Lawlessness: No one respects the law in Peru, including The Law. The bus drivers recently rioted over 'unfair' traffic penalties. Unfair in the sense that they can't afford to pay them. If K ever gets into trouble with the Peruvian fuzz, they'll accept a few greenbacks to pretend it never happened. ITV2: Internazionale v Newcastle - Live (7.30pm) \"Everton: thanks to Fox Sports Latin America, you can catch the English Premiership live every Saturday at 10am, with comedy Spanish commentary included for free. If you prefer the superior brand of Scottish football, you'll find that on ESPN a couple of hours later.\" BBC Radio 5 Live: Sport On Five with Ian Payne (7pm) Sounds great, David. What's the job? We could go for a bit of that ourselves. However, some of you aren't so constructive. Talksport: Football First (7pm) \"She'll only have to worry about Europe until August when they get knocked out by some Estonian builders,\" says Tim Levicki. \"And I can say that with confidence because she won't be able to sue me as she is going to fail her law exam.\" Newstalk 106: Off The Ball With Ger Gilroy (7pm) There will be more advice this time tomorrow.
