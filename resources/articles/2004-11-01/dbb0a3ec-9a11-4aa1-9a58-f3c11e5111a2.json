In this week's Backbencher: Mandy studies schisms on the French left, it's weblogs at dawn at the Commons, and Labour wants to hear just how proud you are of Britain &gt;&gt;&gt; ADVERTISEMENT How your business can recruit and retain able young people. Click here to discover how apprenticeships allow you to invest in the future of your business. The Backbencher asked Michael White how yesterday's Queen's speech had been received. \"Today we've had the debate on the Queen's speech and we've seen the Tory defence spokesman, Nicholas Soames, have a go at Geoff Hoon about its defence implications, which to be honest aren't extensive. But there is plenty to talk about on the defence front - notably over Iraq and the related matter of the reorganisation of the regiments. \"And I think that illustrates an important point about the Queen's speech - it's only half the picture from the government's point of view. The catchphrase we'll have to get used to over the next few months is 'security and opportunity': These are going to be Labour's constant themes until the expected May 5 election. (The Sun told us this was the 'official' date this morning but they've got it wrong before.) During yesterday's Queen's speech Labour made as blatant an effort as I can ever remember to crowd out any political territory in the centre ground that their opponents might take. \"This was particularly evident on the security front in the eight or nine bills David Blunkett has in the pipeline. Lots of them won't become law of course because there isn't time, but in part they are designed to make sure Michael Howard can't get a serious toehold on law and order or say that Labour has been soft on crime, as he used to when he was home secretary. \"Mr Howard in his speech yesterday was forced to say: 'It's all talk and no action. They've raised the taxes and wasted the money.' But he didn't really have a convincing ideological alternative and this is exactly where Tony Blair and Mr Blunkett want him. \"As for Charles Kennedy, many commentators thought he had a rather good day yesterday. He pointed out that it was quite dangerous to get the issues of crime and terrorism intertwined - particularly if they are mixed up with asylum and immigration - as some people might be tempted to do. That could be very damaging to the fabric of society, he said. And then, of course quite fairly as an opponent of the Iraq war, he said that government trying to frighten us doesn't come across very well from a government which got it all wrong about weapons of mass destruction. \"It's not clear yet how Labour MPs will react to it. They are still digesting it and the media's interpretations of it. And more importantly, we're still waiting for the second half of the shoe to drop: Gordon Brown is delivering his pre-budget report next week, which should give details of how he will pay for this security and opportunity and how Labour's third term could look on issues such as child care and work-life balance, which are proving very popular in the polls. \"However, the other big issue this winter looks to be economic productivity. Britons already work some of the longest hours in Europe, and that's how we keep our productivity and output up. So we're waiting for Gordon Brown - the upbeat side of Labour's election campaign, its \"third-term offer\", as Alan Milburn likes to call it. Meanwhile, they've given us a little optimism on account. The Labour party website now has a new section called 'Proud of Britain' (http://www.proudofbritain.org.uk), where you can find out that everything is going better in this country and, if you are moved to join in the spirit, you can send in photos of your local school and the like. It's a conscious attempt to tap into the optimism that saw George Bush and John Howard elected in the US and Australia.\" &gt;&gt;&gt; LAST WEEK'S COMPETITION The question of how Charles Kennedy's Asbo Plus differed from a plain vanilla Asbo flummoxed some readers. \"It's not a terribly imaginative title and not a new idea either,\" scoffed a member of the Crime and Disorder Reduction Team in a London borough that, for his own safety, we won't name. (On the other hand, Matthew, where are you when the Backbencher needs you on a Friday night?) \"[It's] an Asbo with a range of support measures attached. There are loads of behavioural interventions currently available (from Sure Start to Youth Offending Teams) ... I think the reality of the situation is even better than Mr Kennedy's proposal.\" Congratulations, and your MBE and prize will be on their way shortly. Charlie, by the way, was outlining what he meant by \"tough liberalism\" - a concept not unlike the old, familiar \"tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime\" slogan, as Patrick Mahon pointed out. &gt;&gt;&gt; THIS WEEK'S COMPETITION \"They insist on their amendments, to which the Commons have disagreed for which insistence they assign their reasons. And they disagree to the amendment proposed by the Commons in lieu of the Lords, amendments for which disagreement they assign their reasons. Order.\" What is he talking about?

Those who suspect that Mandy is spoiling for another fight with Gordon will have noticed that the commissioner is paying close attention to the infighting among France's socialists, who are hopelessly split over the constitution - so much so that they have established no fewer than three websites to argue their separate cases: Ouisocialiste.net, Nonsocialiste.net (run by the Nouveau Parti Socialiste, an angry offshoot of the PS) and AmbitionEurope.org - who, in the best tradition of pro-European europhobia, are also opposed to the constitution. Of course, these kinds of divisions could never happen in New Labour. Could they? &gt;&gt;&gt; WEBLOGS AT DAWN A stern email arrives from Westminster. \"Backbencher,\" writes a reader, \"if you are referring to Honourable Fiend and Guido Fawkes, perhaps you ought to be looking at the site from which they steal their best material. Best regards, Recess Monkey.\" Gosh! Is this war? The Backbencher wasn't about to light Guido Fawkes's fuse, let alone grapple with the Honourable Fiend, but she feels an outbreak of open blog warfare approaching. Recess Monkey, by the way, is currently campaigning to make fair trade bananas available at the Palace of Westminster. Still, let's not try to change too much, too quickly. The Backbencher seems to remember that the last attempt by a monkey to popularise bananas has so far failed to bear any fruit. &gt;&gt;&gt; NO NEWS IS BAD NEWS While the Queen is being kept away from I'm a Celebrity for her own good, the Backbencher was pleased to discover that Tony Blair is keeping up with the latest in tabloid telly. Sitting down to an interview with ITV's political editor, Nick Robinson, in Washington recently, the prime minister asked: \"What's happened to the 6.30 ITV news?\" Bemused, Mr Robinson mumbled something about the ratings being up. Pulling one of his faces, the PM replied: \"No, I mean WHAT's happened to it?\" Not a fan of its new format, then. &gt;&gt;&gt; PATRIOT GAMES The Backbencher would like to point her more patriotic readers in the direction of Labour's latest website: What makes you proud to be British? The opportunity to sing the praises of the government is \"receiving hundreds of hits a minute\", according to Alan Milburn. So go and have your say. Those tempted to be cynical should remember the words of John Major: \"The knockers and sneerers who may never have taken a risk in their comfortable lives aren't fit to wipe the boots of the risk takers.\" &gt;&gt;&gt; ON TV AND RADIO THIS WEEK FRIDAY, 11pm, BBC4: The Mark Steel Lectures Thomas Paine. MONDAY, 11.30pm, BBC4: Eric Hobsbawm talks to Kirsty Wark Eric explains why he believes his communist views have conflicted with his historical analysis. &gt;&gt;&gt; NEWS ROUND-UP Supergrasses who help bring organised criminals to justice will be offered immunity from prosecution under the terms of a bill published today to set up a 'British FBI'. The leader of the Commons, Peter Hain has been accused of playing politics with terror for claiming that Britain is safer under Labour. Jack Straw has welcomed an Israel announcement that it will allow international observers to monitor the forthcoming Palestinian presidential elections Celebrity anti-war campaigners today joined MPs in Westminster to table a motion calling for parliament to discuss Tony Blair's impeachment over the Iraq war. &gt;&gt;&gt; FINAL READING Identity cards will cost billions of pounds and further infringe our liberties without making us any safer, argues Ed Vaizey Few would have expected Peter Hain to use the Queen's speech to move closer to the US vice-president, Dick Cheney - but that is exactly what he did.
