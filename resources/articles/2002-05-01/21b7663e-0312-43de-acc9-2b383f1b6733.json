Tournament directors, sponsors, television companies and the public (although they are usually least considered) take a dim view of the absence of sporting superstars and these days Woods is extremely circumspect when it comes to affirming future appearances. This week's tournament is certainly not an event to thrill every fibre of his frame but there are considerable compensations. He has a contract to appear in Germany and, to offset any feelings of reluctance to visit this and other, shall we say, less obvious venues, the great man charges up to $2m (\u00a31.4m). Those willing to pay get the full professional package, though whether Woods wins or loses has little relevance for the player. Woods, in common with many international sportsmen, led a sequestered childhood, with the real world suddenly leaping on his broad back in a way reminiscent of his sobriquet. It took him time to adjust. For example, he shied away from specially organised diners and refused to sign golf balls for charity because he feared exploitation. But gradually the sharp edges of his character have been rounded, with the sport's leading players reminding him of what was right and proper and what - at least in public - was quite unacceptable. A commentator who spans the worlds of golf and tennis relates how he once saw both Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer link arms with the young and often headstrong Woods as they walked a major course. They were not even playing but, he said, \"I guess Tiger learned as much in that hour about the game and its demands as many learn in a lifetime.\" He learned how to play the system and not to knock the sport that has since made him rich. This story came back to me yesterday in relation to a remark by an American woman during last Sunday's Italian Open final, where Andre Agassi won the title after missing a championship point in Rome 13 years previously. \"Andre's such a nice guy these days,\" she said. Then, after a telling pause, she continued: \"And he used to be such a jerk.\" The effect that third parties have on sportsmen and sportswomen is unquantifiable, although it is unlikely that either of those elder statesmen John McEnroe or Jimmy Connors slipped a fatherly arm around the youthful Agassi, unless it was to try to strangle him. No, his journey towards maturity has taken considerably more twists and turns than that of Woods, with last year's marriage to Steffi Graf and the birth of their son, Jaden Gill, helping him achieve a harmony between his sport and his personal life that few had ever imagined would be possible. Not that the bald American has suddenly become a paragon. Walter Knapper, tournament director in Hamburg, must have been spitting nails when Agassi pulled out of this week's Masters Series event at the last minute. Yet once Agassi had won in Rome, and with the French Open only two weeks away, it was obvious to all that the American would withdraw, although the usual charade had to be endured. Last Friday Agassi said he was \"scheduled to play\"; by Sunday he was talking about \"taking a good look at things\". In other words, he would not be playing. The Masters Series is a farce. They are not the nine best tournaments and, although they are supposedly \"mandatory\", Agassi has never had the slightest intention of playing in them all. He may be fined but what does he care? It is the system that is bonkers and Agassi plays it for what it is worth, as does Woods. It is all a pretence. Only the major tournaments, and a few of historical importance, count for anything. The rest is about making money, whatever the public may think."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
