Who at games organisers Locog was monitoring the contract with G4S? A fair and simple question for the home affairs committee chairman Keith Vaz to put. Here's the answer Locog's Paul Deighton provided in a letter to Vaz on Monday: \"The contract was initially monitored weekly by the multi-agency Security Workforce Board. From January 2012, this body was subsumed into the Venue Security Deliver Board ('VSBD') [sic], a multi-agency body, meeting weekly, reporting directly to the Olympic Security Board, with members from the Home Office, GOE, Police, MOD, G4S and Locog. The VSDB monitored the G4S progress on the recruitment, training and accreditation of security guards for the Games and received weekly reports.\" There's more. \"Locog established two bodies operating jointly with G4S. These bodies \u2014 the Contract Management Board and the Contract Performance Board, respectively \u2014 reported into the VSDB and initially met bi-weekly before moving to weekly meetings several months ago.\" In May, Locog also instituted weekly meetings with G4S \"to review performance\". Let's not forget the regular reviews by another Locog body, the Contract Review Board. And yet, with all those cooks stirring the broth, it all went wrong. Incredible, really. \u2022 Yes, this has been a week like no other for G4S. Its reputation shot. Enemies circling. Unsurprisingly, its people are at the highest state of alert. Save perhaps, for the G4S security guard at the Team GB Olympic hotel in Salford who was found asleep at his post, contrary to the applicable parts of the company training. He was sacked on the spot and escorted from the premises. Which does seem harsh. The chief exec would appear to have been asleep since February. \u2022 So many warnings about the difficulties of G4S, apparently, but no immediate sign that any were heeded. Difficult to know why. But there are clues. In the latest edition of House &amp; Garden magazine, Lord Coe's better half, Carole Annett, reveals that the big Olympics cahuna writes everything in longhand as he has never learned to type or use a computer \u2013 and he considers emails a \"major intrusion\". So did he read the emails about G4S? \u2022 No one comes out of this well. The Home Office, we see from the Deighton letter, was involved in all the fun and games. Who was responsible there? Unkind souls point to Charles Farr, the director of the office for security and counter-terrorism, who was Theresa May's eyes and ears in this regard \u2013 but perhaps did not see or hear as much as he might have. But then it has been a busy time. For among his other enthusiasms has been the home secretary's grand plan to snoop on all of our emails. It's difficult, this walking and chewing gum at the same time. \u2022 What will he do now? Well, we know what he won't be doing. For it is said that Farr hoped to ascend to greatness at the top of the security services. Arising from that assumption was a reluctance on his part to be filmed giving evidence to such as the home affairs select committee. But the issue is now moot and the committee has been told it can film him whenever it wants. For \"during July\", writes Theresa May to home affairs select committee chairman Keith Vaz, \"it was agreed that Charles will not be returning to the intelligence services in the foreseeable future\". With the uncertainty a thing of the past, he'll have more time to organise the monitoring of your emails. \u2022 More, finally, on the decision of the BBC to name a room at Broadcasting House after its first chief engineer, PP Eckersley, despite his regrettable association with Sir Oswald Mosley. The pair hatched a mad plan to establish a rival broadcasting network. Should the BBC have honoured him? Yes, indeed, says his daughter-in-law Diana, a cheery soul. \"His contribution to the BBC was huge. He was blackballed from the BBC and never got the acclaim he should have. To turn him down a second time because of his slight relationship with Mosley would be criminal.\" So his legacy is secure, though it be a trifle dodgy.
