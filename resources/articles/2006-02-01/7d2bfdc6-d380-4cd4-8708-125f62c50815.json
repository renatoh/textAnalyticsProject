Set up by motor enthusiast and former fuel tax campaigner Ben Scammell, the Pipeline Discount Card plans to combine the bulk buying power of millions of motorists to offer discounts of 5p-10p a litre on both petrol and diesel. Borrowing the idea from Holland where a similar scheme already operates successfully, users would all use the same garage network to buy their fuel. At the time of purchase they would hand over their membership card to receive the discount in the form of a cashback. \"This is really about using the power of the internet to get a better deal for ordinary British motorists. We have only been going for a few months but we have already secured an agreement in principle from a major retail partner and our membership is growing very quickly. The card is free - there is no annual fee so people have nothing to lose by signing up. It takes about 30 seconds online at pipelinecard.org,\" he says. Pipeline expects to begin issuing cards before the summer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
