The Kenyan-born British rider also said he has set his sights on winning a series of Tours and that the form of his team-mate Richie Porte will make Sky a force to be reckoned with later this month. Froome, fresh from winning the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 with Porte in second place, told the Times: \"An interesting element now, with Richie sitting second, is in some people's minds. They are going to have to work pretty hard to get a spot on the podium, let alone trying to go for the victory. It is probably moving the goalposts a bit.\" The 28-year-old went on to admit that it is \"a shame not to have the defending champion\" at this year's Tour. \"Because with Bradley there comes a certain feel of, 'We've got the defending champion, we have more respect in the peloton'. But it is also nice not to have that continuing pressure from the media. \"We do have a very strong team and, regardless of Bradley there or not, I do feel we have all our bases covered.\" Froome was happy to talk up his own form after an early season that has taken in victories in the Tour of Oman, Crit\u00e9rium International, Tour de Romandie and the Dauphin\u00e9. He said: \"I have been a lot more consistent with my numbers this year and I have been able to hit the numbers that last year I thought were exceptional. And I feel I can still get better. Last year I felt: 'I am really flying now.' This year I am hitting that comfortably now.\" Froome is yet to win a grand tour, finishing second both in France last year and in the 2011 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a, but believes he has the ability to become the man to beat in stage races for years to come. \"I've got my goals and personally where I want my career to go is to target the Tour,\" he said. \"Not just this year but for the next six or seven years and each time to line up at the Tour ready to try and contend for the yellow jersey. I am driven by that goal.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
