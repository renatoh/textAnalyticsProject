Ag\u00fcero was dismissed for his lunge on the Brazilian towards the end of Chelsea\u2019s 3-1 win after leaping into a challenge and making contact with the inside of David Luiz\u2019s outstretched right leg. The centre-half then appeared to twist his other leg as he fell, lying on the turf clutching his left knee while players from both sides confronted each other near the touchline, and limped away from the stadium. Conte was oblivious at the time to the wild nature of the tackle, which has earned Ag\u00fcero a four-match suspension as his second red card offence of the campaign, but has since reviewed footage of the incident on television. \u201cOnly after I saw the replays, that\u2019s when I saw this was a very dangerous challenge for David Luiz,\u201d said the Chelsea manager, whose team go into the weekend three points clear at the top. \u201cI have to check on Saturday if David Luiz is able to play on Sunday because, after this tackle \u2026 this tackle was very bad. \u201cSo I have to check on his recovery from his injury. It will be very important tomorrow for him and for me to decide whether he\u2019s able to play on Sunday. That tackle was dangerous, for sure. I watched the images and I was afraid [he might be injured]. I was scared. He\u2019s trying to recover from this tackle.\u201d The centre-half, who has been ever present since returning to the Chelsea side after his transfer deadline day move from Paris Saint-Germain, has been one of the key performers in the team\u2019s renewed defensive discipline over recent weeks as the central pivot in the reshaped back three. He trained on his own earlier this week to help his leg to recover but, while still feeling the aftereffects of the challenge, has played some part with the full group over the past two days. That would suggest he should be able to take his place in an unchanged backline against West Brom when Nemanja Matic is expected to return from a calf strain to partner N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 in midfield. The Serb, absent at City, has been able to play a full part at Cobham since Tuesday, meaning Cesc F\u00e0bregas will revert to the substitutes\u2019 bench as Chelsea seek to secure a ninth successive league win. Willian, who came off the bench to score the visitors\u2019 second goal at the Etihad Stadium, may start the game ahead of Pedro, with Conte prepared to rotate his squad more in the period ahead as the leaders, who are without European football this season, face seven games in four weeks. \u201cWe\u2019ll have three games in seven days this week and, for this reason, it\u2019s important to have all the squad, all the players in good form,\u201d said Conte, whose side play at struggling Sunderland on Wednesday and at Crystal Palace next Saturday after playing Tony Pulis\u2019s West Brom. \u201cI could take the decision to have more rotation. \u201cThe best [scenario] is always to have a squad with 22, 23 or 24 players at a great level to support sometimes if you have some injuries during the season. But I think the most important thing now is to think game by game. For now it\u2019s important to be fully concentrated on West Brom. \u201cThen, after the game, if we have new injuries or I see some players tired, we will see.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
