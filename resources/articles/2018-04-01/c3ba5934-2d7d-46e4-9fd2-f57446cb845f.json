The last eight days have produced victories against Leeds and now Castleford but the differing manner in the way those wins have come about should provide the greatest optimism yet that the woes of 2017 are firmly behind the Warriors this season. While last week they scraped home against Leeds courtesy of Sam Tomkins\u2019s drop goal, there could be no argument about the worthy winners here, as the Warriors took full advantage of a Castleford side below the standards Super League has come to expect from them in recent years. The latter half of last season was the nadir of Shaun Wane\u2019s six-year reign as Wigan coach; but in the aftermath of that poor ending, which left the Warriors sixth and outside the play-off places for the first time in years, there was a defiant message from Wane that they would learn from those mistakes before this season. With nine wins now from their opening 11 league games, all the evidence suggests Wane\u2019s prediction is a decent one. \u201cWe can get miles better, though,\u201d was his defiant post-match message to the rest of the competition. \u201cI think there\u2019s loads of improvement left in us: I\u2019m never truly happy with things.\u201d For Castleford this defeat \u2013 only their third of 2018 \u2013 was a rare off-night for last season\u2019s Grand Finalists who, by and large, have maintained the momentum that took them to a maiden appearance at Old Trafford last October, even if without the same level of attacking panache they displayed for large periods last year. \u201cI don\u2019t think we showed the best of ourselves tonight,\u201d said their coach, Daryl Powell. Castleford\u2019s scrum-half, Luke Gale, had kicked them into an early lead but after Tomkins had replied from the tee, tries by Oliver Gildart and Liam Farrell put the hosts into a commanding 14-2 lead. Farrell\u2019s try in particular raised a wry smile from Wigan\u2019s guest for the night, the England rugby coach, Eddie Jones. \u201cI didn\u2019t speak to him \u2013 I had a game to go and win,\u201d Wane joked afterwards. Castleford responded to those early setbacks well, though, and, after Oliver Holmes reduced the deficit, a wonderful set move ended with a debut try for the wing, Garry Lo, to make it 14-12. The Papua New Guinean was one of Castleford\u2019s biggest positives in a below-par performance \u2013 and Wigan quickly asserted their dominance after half-time when a scintillating break from Joe Burgess laid the platform for Gildart\u2019s second try. When George Williams stretched out on the hour mark to open up a two-score lead, it was clear who the winner would be and Tony Clubb\u2019s try four minutes from time merely rubbed it in on another successful night for Wigan. Wigan remain two points behind the leaders, St Helens, after they posted the highest score of the season so far to inflict more misery on Huddersfield. Justin Holbrook\u2019s side ran in 12 tries \u2013 including a hat-trick for the sensational Ben Barba \u2013 in their 66-4 victory as they solidified their position at the summit and ensured the Giants remain second from bottom. The night\u2019s other result saw Salford further strengthen their claims for a top-eight finish with a convincing victory over Wakefield, who the Red Devils moved above into seventh place. Jake Bibby scored twice as the hosts beat Trinity 38-4."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
