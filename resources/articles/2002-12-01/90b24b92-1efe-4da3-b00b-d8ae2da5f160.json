I like the commentators in them. I like Robert Fisk in the Independent, though there are one or two I don't like. I particularly dislike the Sun and the Mail. They're just vile papers, they stir up dirt, they're immoral and unprincipled. Magazines: The Radio Times and Red Pepper as regular magazines and that's about it. I have so much reading material around I have to be careful, or it stops me reading books. Books: I'm reading the last part of [Philip Pullman's] His Dark Materials trilogy. I think it's extraordinary. I'm trying to finish it so I can start reading The Corrections. TV: I'm very depressed by television, though it is my medium. I'm depressed that the government is going to relax the rules so that the channels are going to be self-governing and won't have to show any drama, so there'll be more of these programmes I dislike - these voting programmes and cookery and makeover shows. It's cheap, diluted television. I like The Office and [Alan] Partridge, Newsnight Review and David Attenborough's wildlife programmes. But I don't like programmes that demand that I have to watch the next week or the next day at the same time. Radio: I enjoy the radio. I love listening to it more and more. I like to hear people talking on the radio - Woman's Hour and Desert Island Discs. I like the concerts on Radio 3 and Radio 2 in the evenings. Adverts: Orange have got a good one out - it's nothing to do with telephones until the very end. Guinness do good adverts, and I like the beer advert with the wounded soldier and the foot on the pump. A good advert is a work of art. New Media: I really enjoy email and use the internet for tickets and hotels. But I don't browse - I don't like looking at the screen for more than half an hour. \u00b7 Roger Lloyd Pack plays Trigger in Only Fools and Horses, and Owen Newitt in The Best Of The Vicar Of Dibley, out on CD and video"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
