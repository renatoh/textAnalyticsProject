If you\u2019re the captain of the Titanic, approaching a giant iceberg with the potential to sink your ship becomes an emergency only when you realise you might not have enough time to steer a safe course. And so it is, says Prof Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, when it comes to the climate emergency. Knowing how long societies have to react to pull the brake on the Earth\u2019s climate and then how long it will take for the ship to slow down is the difference between a climate emergency and a manageable problem. Rather than being something abstract and open to interpretation, Schellnhuber says the climate emergency is something with clear and calculable risks that you could put into a formula. And so he wrote one. Emergency = R \u00d7 U = p \u00d7 D \u00d7 \u03c4 / T In a comment article in the journal Nature, Schellnhuber and colleagues explained that to understand the climate emergency we needed to quantify the relationship between risk (R) and urgency (U). Borrowing from the insurance industry, the scientists define risk (R) as the probability of something happening (p) multiplied by damage (D). For example, how likely is it that sea levels will rise by a metre and how much damage will that cause. Urgency (U) is the time it takes you to react to an issue (\u03c4) \u201cdivided by the intervention time left to avoid a bad outcome (T)\u201d, they wrote. Schellnhuber, of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, tells Guardian Australia the work on the formula was just the \u201ctip of a mathematical iceberg\u201d in defining the climate emergency. \u201cIt can be illustrated by the Titanic disaster, but it applies to many severe risks where you can calculate the do-nothing/business-as-usual probability of a highly damaging event,\u201d he says. \u201cYet there are options to avoid the disaster. \u201cIn other words, this a control problem.\u201d There is a time lag between the rapid cuts to greenhouse gases and the climate system reacting. Knowing if you have enough time tells you if you\u2019re in an emergency or not. Schellnhuber used \u201cstandard risk analysis and control theory\u201d to come up with the formula, and he was already putting numbers to it. \u201cAs a matter of fact, the intervention time left for limiting global warming to less than 2C is about 30 [years] at best. The reaction time \u2013 time needed for full global decarbonisation - is at least 20 [years].\u201d As the scientists write in Nature, if the \u201creaction time is longer than the intervention time left\u201d then \u201cwe have lost control\u201d. Schellnhuber says: \u201cBeyond that critical point, only some sort of adaptation option is left, such as moving the Titanic passengers into rescue boats (if available).\u201d Earlier this month, Oxford Dictionaries announced \u201cclimate emergency\u201d as the word of the year, defining it as \u201ca situation in which urgent action is required to reduce or halt climate change and avoid potentially irreversible environmental damage resulting from it\u201d. One website tracking climate emergency declarations says 1,195 jurisdictions in 25 countries, representing 454 million people, have already voted on the emergency. This week the European parliament joined them, as did Ballina shire council in northern New South Wales, the 76th local government authority in Australia to make the declaration. Prof Will Steffen, of the Australian National University and the Stockholm Resilience Centre, and a co-author of the article, says: \u201cEmergency can mean many things to many people. But there are some hard numbers behind why so many people are saying we are in a climate emergency. \u201cThis formula sharpens our thinking. So we have 30 years to decarbonise and to stabilise our pressure on the climate system.\u201d In the Nature article, the scientists highlight nine \u201ctipping points\u201d that, if crossed, become almost impossible to stop. At least five are already \u201cactive\u201d. Some of them, like melting permafrost or forest degradation, can start to add more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, making the job of keeping global temperatures down even harder. \u201cThere are a range of these intervention times left,\u201d Steffen says. \u201cHow long do we have before [the Greenland ice sheet] goes? Maybe we have 20 to 25 years and then we might be committed to losing Greenland. \u201cBut the time we have left to intervene to stabilise coral reefs, for example, is a lot less than 30 years. \u201cOur reaction time has to be fast and to decarbonise by 2050 we have to really move now. That\u2019s the point of [Schellnhuber\u2019s] maths. \u201cTo err on the side of danger is a stupid thing to do.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
