Jollied along by jokey music, the opening instalment of the director Benjamin Leigh\u2019s documentary about the launch of the UK\u2019s first restaurant staffed by people with dementia proves likeable and baffling in equal measure. Still, any show that helps raise awareness of the disease and the impact it can have on those still of working age must be a good thing. Mike Bradley Surviving R Kelly: The Impact 9pm, Crime + Investigation The six-hour documentary series Surviving R Kelly aired earlier this year, cataloguing sexual-abuse claims levelled at the singer who styled himself \u201cthe R in R&amp;B\u201d. This sombre follow-up analyses the impact of the series, from his record label cutting ties with him to Kelly being indicted on multiple charges in Chicago. Graeme Virtue Student Sex Workers: Stripping to Study 10pm, Channel 5 The latest offering in Channel 5\u2019s unofficial season of depressing documentaries. This one is about cash-strapped students resorting to sex work. \u201cCam-girling\u201d works out OK for some (Mum can even be in the next room, making a cuppa), but escorts such as 19-year-old Tom take safety risks. Ellen E Jones Wild Bill 9pm, ITV The range of American heartthrob Rob Lowe never ceases to amaze, so his role as a disgraced Miami police chief who moves to the UK to head up the Lincolnshire police should come as no surprise. It may be overambitious and uneven, but Dudi Appleton\u2019s new show is more comedy than drama and it is worth a try. MB The Dark Side of the Ring 10pm, Vice One for the hardcore grapple fans, this instalment of the series about the bizarre universe of professional wrestling tells the volatile love story of wrestling royalty Randy \u201cMacho Man\u201d Savage and \u201cMiss Elizabeth\u201d Hulette and its ruptures beyond the ring \u2013 not helped by Hulk Hogan. Tough stuff. MB Secrets of Sugar Baby Dating 10.35pm, BBC One The skin-crawling term \u201csugar baby\u201d refers to a young woman who rinses older men for cash and luxury gifts. Naturally, it is an unregulated business. Tiffany Sweeney goes undercover to find out just how dangerous it is. On her travels, she meets an 18-year-old supported by seven \u201csugar daddies\u201d. Hannah Verdier Film choice Serena (Susanne Bier, 2014), 1.50am, Channel 4 Silver Linings Playbook couple Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper are reunited in this Depression-era drama. Cooper is the owner of a logging firm; when he marries beautiful, poor Serena, he has the ideal partner for his cut-throat business. Lawrence is superb as it all goes up in a melodramatic blaze.
