The incident left four people injured and was followed by a protest organised by the activist group No Big Ships. Another protest is planned for Saturday. \u201cThe images coming out of Venice do not need many words,\u201d No Big Ships said in a statement. \u201cA large ship threatened to trigger a tragedy. One wonders how it is possible that, despite Venetian citizens asking for years that these polluting monsters be blocked from the lagoon, nothing has been done yet.\u201d The crash, which happened after the 13-deck MSC Opera experienced an engine failure, provoked more infighting among Italy\u2019s governing coalition partners. Matteo Salvini, of the far-right League, blamed the Five Star Movement (M5S) for failing to support a project to divert cruise liners from the busy Giudecca canal. Danilo Toninelli, M5S\u2019s transport minister, said on Monday that a solution for an alternative route would soon be found and that his party was in favour of closing off the Giudecca canal \u2013 the main thoroughfare that leads to St Mark\u2019s Square \u2013 to big ships. \u201cBut first it is necessary to find an alternative, the definitive one and a provisional one, so that Venice does not lose cruise tourism,\u201d Toninelli said. \u201cAfter years of stalling, we are close to a solution that is capable of finally holding together all the interests on the field.\u201d Campaigners shrugged off the government response as a pleasantry, arguing that any alternative route would still require canals to be dredged, further damaging the fragile lagoon. Marco Gasparinetti, who leads the city\u2019s Gruppo 25 Aprile activist group, said: \u201cWe want these big ships completely out of the lagoon \u2013 they are a danger to our homes, our monuments and the environment.\u201d Gasparinetti recalled that a few years ago another MSC ship, while anchored in front of Dubrovnik\u2019s walled city, tore up pipelines connecting the nearby island of Lokrum, leaving residents without water and electricity for weeks. The port of Civitavecchia, 60 miles from Rome, is a major transit point for cruise ship passengers visiting the capital and other cities including Florence. Gasparinetti suggested applying a similar system for Venice. \u201cCruise tourism represents roughly 5% of visitors, who mostly only spend a few hours in Venice,\u201d he said. \u201cLet the ships dock further away in Trieste or Chioggia, we don\u2019t need them here.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
