After watching the Old Firm match yesterday, Vogts also revealed that he hopes to speak to Tommy Burns today to invite the Celtic youth team manager to join him as part-time assistant, and that Celtic's Stephen Crainey will be in the squad for his first international against France in Paris at the end of this month. \"I spoke to Lambert when he came to my office and I hope for my sake and for Scotland's sake that he changes his mind. We need him,\" said Vogts. Lambert said he was \"very flattered\" and would give his answer \"this week\". Furthermore, Vogts admitted that he has talked to Liverpool's manager G\u00e9rard Houllier about Gary McAllister, who has also retired from international football."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
