Surrey Street, capacity 2,374 at bursting point, is hemmed in by industrial estates, has portable cabins for dressing rooms, the roof of one stand blew off last year, and the place is held together by the indomitable determination of a core of volunteers. The ground was full last month when, in the semi-final second leg against Chalfont St Peter, Glossop, who play in the North West Counties League First Division, scored with the game's last kick, in the 124th minute, to equalise 5-5 on aggregate. They then won on penalties to reach the final. \"It is absolutely amazing for our club,\" said 29-year-old Darren Hamilton, 11 years a striker with Glossop, who works as an engineer for a tooling company next to the ground. \"I've been dreaming about the match. I think the whole team has the same fantasy about scoring the winner.\" Glossop, the underdogs against Northern League side Whitley Bay, are rich in history. The Derbyshire town is the smallest to have fielded a club in the top flight of English football, having, in 1899-1900, played in a First Division containing Liverpool, Everton and Newcastle, when Aston Villa finished as champions. Promoted the previous season with Manchester City, Glossop were there because the town's most prominent cotton mill owner had taken over the club and used his influence to gain entry to an expanded Second Division in 1898. He poured in money to sign professionals from Scotland \u2013 including the marvellously named striker Hunter McCosh \u2013 and from Liverpool and Luton Town. The chairman's name was Samuel Hill-Wood, born in 1872 when his grandfather's hard work had established the vast mill and made the family fortune.Sam was sent to Eton, where he played cricket and football, and sport always interested him more than cotton mills. Accounts vary of how much he sank into the club, but it was not enough to keep Glossop in the First Division beyond that single season. Relegated to the Second Division, they battled gamely until 1914-1915 when the League played on, to huge criticism, despite the onset of war, and Glossop finished bottom. When the league resumed in 1919, Arsenal won their notorious \"dodgy\" promotion, somehow spirited into the First Division above Wolves and Barnsley despite having finished below them in 1915. Even Arsenal's official history describes as \"outrageous\" the arm-twisting orchestrated by their property-developing chairman, Henry Norris. Arsenal have never been relegated since, while Glossop were not accepted back into the league and fell into semi-professional football. In 1921, with the cotton industry in terminal decline, Samuel Hill-Wood left Glossop, selling his mill, the grand family home at Moorfield, the philanthropic legacies left by his mother, Anne, and pulling his money out of the football club. He went to London, began supporting Arsenal, and was invited on to the board by Norris. When, in 1927, Norris was banned for life by an FA commission investigating financial irregularities, Hill-Wood took over, and it was he who worked with Herbert Chapman to bring \"lucky Arsenal\" their string of championships in the 1930s. He also oversaw the building of Highbury into a football cathedral complete with marble halls, and secured the renaming of Gillespie Road tube station to Arsenal. He remained Arsenal's chairman, except for a short break, until he died in 1948. His son, Denis, took over in 1961, and in 1982 Denis's son, Peter Hill-Wood, became the chairman. He is still there today. Peter Hill-Wood, who cannot be at Wembley today because of Arsenal's game against Chelsea, did invite Glossop to prepare on Arsenal's Colney training ground yesterday (though that did not fit with manager Steve Young's plans), and sent a letter and silver salver to Glossop's hotel. Today's Arsenal programme will also include comments from Hill-Wood about his \"soft spot\" for Glossop, despite, he says, having visited the town only twice, for the funerals of his grandparents. Over the years, Glossop have hoped for a more material acknowledgement of the Arsenal link. Arsenal did send a team to mark Glossop's centenary in 1986, but there has been no contact since then until this weekend. In 1990, Glossop nearly folded under debts run up by a former chairman. They have written in desperation to Arsenal periodically, without receiving replies. \"It was very nice to receive the offer of training,\" said director Adrian Priestley, who has taken to visiting Samuel Hill-Wood's grave and, as he puts it, \"having a word with Sammy\" about summoning the fates to help Glossop win. \"But there needs to be more solidarity in football between the rich clubs and the likes of us, who, with all our heritage, have nearly gone under again recently for what are really insignificant debts.\" When, last week, Arsenal director Richard Carr and his family made more than \u00a340m by selling shares, bought in the 1940s, to investor Stan Kroenke (Hill-Wood thanked Carr for \"his hard work, effort and integrity\"), Priestley, unpaid like all Glossop's directors, was filling two skips with sodden rubbish that had been rotting away behind the club house. Young, an HGV driver who was previously a youth coach at Stockport County, is more focused on the Glossop of today, his ambition to lead the club into the UniBond League. Of the Arsenal heritage, he said: \"It slaps you in the face, the gap between rich and poor in football. Arsenal have recognised our achievements this year, which is a small token, and we would really hope this can be the start of a more solid relationship.\" There are plans either to build a new stadium or to refurbish Surrey Street with the money made from the Vase run. \"It would be great if Arsenal could send a team to play us, to mark the opening when it happens,\" Young reflected. Hill-Wood responded positively to that. \"If we have the time it would certainly be something I would support. There is a limit to how many of these things one can do, but we are aware of our roots.\" The Hill-Wood sporting roots live on at Wembley today and in the patched-up, homely ground in Glossop where, since 1915, a football club has played without much glamour or glory \u2013 until this season, which has dusted them with the magic of the Vase."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
