The public loos there cost an outrageous 50p a go. The Socialist Worker magazine-seller next to Embankment tube station is on to this in a flash. \"50p to have a piss \u2013 a lesson in capitalism,\" he is soon shouting. Later, I'm pleased to see someone has punched a hole in the wooden sign advertising the price. I went up to London for the march on a whim \u2013 to be there in the hope that it might signal some break in the besuited, braindead inertia that governs (if that is the word) British politics. I hadn't intended to write anything, but somehow my notebook started filling up with observations and lines overheard. \"Get it right,\" a man with two metal walking sticks and wearing a green \"Climate Emergency\" hat instructs me when he sees me scribbling. It's cold and I fear the event might be a damp squib. I get to the Embankment about half an hour before the off \u2013 no one seems to know exactly when it will begin \u2013 and there are just a few knots of keen youngsters. It doesn't feel like the beginning of a revolution. But then, further down the road near Temple, I begin to make out the trade union banners, see a host of Asian Cafod supporters descending from Waterloo Bridge, hear the drums and brass bands, and I know it will be a success. The sun even comes out briefly. But what constitutes success? Getting 50,000 people on to the streets on a cold and intermittently wet day? For sure. But the anti-Iraq war march managed a million, and we still perpetrated that insane conflict. Getting the GMB, Christian Aid, Friends of the Earth and Climate Emergency to line up together at the front of the march? Certainly. Though I hear the organiser of one group of youngsters with drums and whistles telling them to wait before joining the march because \"the unions want to march together at the front.\" This curious red/green, old/young, Christian/anarchist alliance is going to be hard to bring off. Two ravers, accustomed to the rhythmic drumming, try to dance to a march being played by the brass band. They find it hard to move to the music without seeming to mock it. Their difficulty is emblematic of how tough it will be to harness the organisational skills and rootedness of the traditional trade union movement with the energy and mobility of the newer anti-globalisation protesters. But what a force for change, if it can be achieved. Every shade of left opinion is on the march, or on the edges of the march, selling papers. No capitalist could be more fervent in their marketing. The man selling Workers' Vanguard buttonholes a teenager and tries to extract 40p, but the youngster has no money. Nearby, though, someone else is signing up for an annual sub, and the woman at the trestle table is ecstatic. \"Free Anarchist News \u2013 Join the anarchists,\" shouts another vendor, apparently unaware of the irony. Changing society is hard, and usually starts with a split in the elite. The English civil war and the French revolution both began with a fissure in the governing classes; their falling-out created the space for populist movements to develop. For a grassroots movement to effect change is enormously difficult. It was only possible in Russia in 1917 because of the devastation wrought by war. Assuming the ruling elite doesn't fissure and the current economic collapse stops short of devastation, how can we loosen the hold of our sclerotic politics? I buy a copy of 1917: The Journal of the International Bolshevik Tendency in search of enlightenment, but it's hopelessly academic. Socialist Worker has a three-point strategy: \"Seize their wealth,\" \"Stamp out poverty,\" \"End all wars.\" Sounds good, but I can't work out exactly who \"their\" refers to. The Socialist party is hot on slogans, colder on the mechanism by which they are put into practice. The likely outcome to the current crisis still appears to be government by Etonians. I fall in with some anarchists halfway through the march \u2013 a delightful young Greek called Alex and an Italian, who is happy to talk about Bakunin, but is, I sense, a little suspicious of me. The anarchists march together \u2013 with the police flanking them in a way they don't with the rest of the march \u2013 and I am intrigued that they never shout slogans or bang drums. Their mission is a serious one. Alex tells me a reporter from the Sunday Times has already approached him to ask why anarchists wear masks. \"Work it out for yourself \u2013 you're a journalist,\" he'd told him. \"People always ask why we wear masks; they never ask about our ideology,\" he complains. In essence, that ideology is: power corrupts; all elites will be corrupt; so government should be by the people, for the people \u2013 a mass movement of the type they claim is emerging in South America. Hezbollah is also mentioned favourably, a movement they see as developing organically. \"Organic\" is a key word for anarchists, and it would save a lot of aggro and bad press if they were called organicists rather than anarchists. When the march eventually gets to Hyde Park, the anarchists refuse to join the \"TUC bureaucrats\" for the official rally and hold their own open-platform meeting at Speakers' Corner, dominated by elderly men in hats who talk less about Bakunin than about beating up the BNP and confronting the police on the streets of Whitechapel. It's all a bit depressing (and expletive-filled \u2013 I take serious exception to the denunciation of \"Oxbridge cunts\"), though I like the fact that the elderly men refuse even to use a megaphone \u2013 only the ordinary human voice is organic enough. The main body of the march is late arriving \u2013 some say a deliberate police tactic, others say just an accident \u2013 but the result is that Hyde Park never feels very organic, in an anarchist or any other sense. Everyone dribbles in and dribbles out again; the speeches on the TUC platform are incredibly dull, devoid of both thought and oratorical power; musicians drone on about bringing love to the world; the event is presented by a bald bloke I don't even recognise. Alex the Greek anarchist tells me it's Tony Robinson from Blackadder, a likable man whose heart is in the right place, but not necessarily someone I would have chosen to take on the combined might of the G20. I end up feeling that neither Robinson and the TUC, nor the Whitechapel anarchists, have the answer. Alex I like, but I don't quit see who runs the NHS in his government-less world. Sister Mary Esther hands me a leaflet called \"No to Bank Loan Slavery\" proposing a new, non-convertible currency; a young man hands me a note saying, \"Don't turn to jelly, turn to God\"; another man has a banner proclaiming, \"Production for need not profit equals sustainable climate.\" I assume he is not in advertising. Nothing quite hangs together, though I like the Australian wearing a sweatshirt with the old 1929 slogan: \"Jump, you f*uckers\". He tells me the asterisk is his child-friendly version \u2013 he is clearly not a Whitechapel anarchist. At about 4pm, the anarchists at Speakers' Corner pack up, with a hat-wearer roaring, \"See you Wednesday!\" to the crowd of about 150; the TUC rally is still going with some dreary song, but most people are filing away as the rain starts to fall and a misty chill descends. It has been a beginning, but no more than that. Now the job is to make the alliance, the new politics, the grassroots organisation live. If only to give the lie to what I hear a police officer in Whitehall tell an elderly man who asks him what's going on. \"It's a TUC march about jobs and job security,\" he tells him, \"the usual stuff.\" The usual stuff! That's how the politicians and their agents (the anarchist lingo is catching) would like to see it. Time to prove them wrong."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
