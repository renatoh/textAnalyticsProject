In February this year President Hilda Heine announced plans to introduce a cryptocurrency to operate as the country\u2019s second legal tender alongside the US dollar, saying her country must not remain idle but \u201cadvance into the future\u201d. The cryptocurrency, known as Sovereign or \u201cSov\u201d was to be issued by an Israeli start-up company, which, according to the International Monetary Fund has \u201climited financial sector experience\u201d. Heine said adopting the currency was \u201can alternate\u201d way for the Marshall Islands to work towards financial self-sufficiency, and the Israeli start-up had not unduly pressured the government. \u201cI don\u2019t see any indication of us being harmed \u2026 this is not an illicit activity. This is not illegal and our laws will not be tarnished,\u201d Heine said. On Monday eight senators introduced a vote of no confidence in the president. Heine was elected in 2016 and is the first female head of state in the Pacific Islands. She has earned a reputation as a passionate climate change advocate and has committed her country to becoming carbon neutral by 2050. While Heine\u2019s climate advocacy work has been widely praised by the international community, her plan to introduce the cryptocurrency has been criticised as fool-hardy. In September the IMF urged the Marshall Islands to \u201cseriously reconsider\u201d the plan, saying it \u201cwould increase macroeconomic and financial integrity risks\u201d, tarnish the government\u2019s financial reputation and make the country \u2013 which is heavily reliant on foreign aid \u2013 vulnerable to cybersecurity risks. The Marshall Islands, located about halfway between Hawaii and Australia, gained its independence in 1986 after four decades under US administration. It contains Bikini Atoll, site of nuclear testing by the US between 1947-1962. Unemployment stands at around 36%. In the report the IMF said the Israeli start-up charged with issuing Sovereign had not made plans for \u201ctransaction monitoring, reporting of suspicious transactions, compliance monitoring, and sanctioning of compliance failures\u201d. It said all cryptocurrencies were at risk of being misused for \u201cmoney laundering and terrorist financing\u201d purposes. The no confidence vote has been schedule for 12 November. Earlier this year Venezuela announced the launch of a digital currency in a bid to tackle hyperinflation. But an investigation by Reuters news agency found no evidence of the currency in use or accepted by shops anywhere in the country. President Heine was contacted for an interview but declined."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
