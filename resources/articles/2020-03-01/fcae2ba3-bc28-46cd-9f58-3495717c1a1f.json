I wonder why? TikTok ... we need to talk.\u201d The clip has received over 8m views on TikTok. A TikTok spokesperson told the Guardian that Lizzo\u2019s videos were not removed because she was wearing a bathing suit. They cited other violations, including \u201csexual gratification\u201d, that lead to a moderator initially banning the videos. The spokesperson specifically cited one video that featured Lizzo lifting up her dress to reveal her undergarments. There was initial confusion over what the garments were. After officials at TikTok spoke to Lizzo\u2019s team, and the undergarments were confirmed to be Spanx, not underwear, the videos were reinstated exactly as they were originally uploaded. \u201cWe love Lizzo\u2019s creativity,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cAnd the videos were originally removed because of other violations, not a bathing suit.\u201d The Juice singer has worked hard to combat negative comments and attitudes towards her physical appearance. Last year, Lizzo received a flurry of attacks for wearing an ass-less dress and thong to an NBA game. \u201cNever ever let somebody stop you or shame you from being yourself,\u201d she said in response to the attacks. \u201cThis is who I\u2019ve always been. Now everyone\u2019s looking at it, and your criticism can just remain your criticism. Your criticism has no effect on me.\u201d Lizzo also shrugged off the controversial comments fitness expert Jillian Michaels made on the body-positivity movement surrounding the singer. (\u201cWhy are we celebrating her body? Why does it matter? Why aren\u2019t we celebrating her music? \u2019Cause it isn\u2019t gonna be awesome if she gets diabetes.\u201d Michaels said during a morning news segment.) TikTok is not the first social media platform Lizzo has taken issue with. Last year, she quit Twitter due to severe bullying and online trolls. TikTok has come under fire before for its censorship of users\u2019 content. In November, Washington DC officials held hearings over the app censoring political content. And last year, officials at TikTok admitted to censoring offensive content in an effort to curb bullying towards users who are fat, disabled, LGBTQ+, and/or people of color. Social media platforms have long faced accusations of unfairly censoring women\u2019s bodies, with many women\u2019s rights groups calling the decisions sexist. Instagram has come under fire for heavily deleting photos that feature women\u2019s nipples. The Free the Nipple movement rages on the app \u2013 multiple artists and celebrities, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, and Chrissy Teigen have challenged the censorship rule with their own buzzed-about, scandalous photos. In 2015, Milk and Honey poet Rupi Kaur gained notoriety for challenging Instagram\u2019s ban on period blood by posting her own."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
