The nostalgia-fuelled celebration will happen in late September on a specially created digital station \u2013 Radio 1 Vintage \u2013 at a time when Radio 1 itself is under pressure because its core youth audience is falling. Blackburn, who spoke the first words on Radio 1 in 1967, will be first on Radio 1 Vintage and Radio 1 itself, with the current breakfast show host Nick Grimshaw, followed by 50 one-hour shows, including archive material from John Peel and Zoe Ball. Blackburn said that launching Radio 1 was \u201cundoubtedly the highlight of my career\u201d. The presenter, whose career began on the pirate ships Caroline and London the BBC station was intended to replace, added: \u201c I owe so much to Radio 1 for my long career...it has been amazing to see how it has developed over the years to changes in technology, music, demand.\u201d Grimshaw said he couldn\u2019t wait to present with Blackburn. \u201cRadio 1 is the only station I\u2019ve loyally listened to my whole life,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom John Peel playing punk on night-times and Sara Cox playing Missy on breakfast, it was key in forming my musical education.\u201d Surviving DJs from the last 50 years have been invited to provide five-minute introductions to archive material of their shows on the sister station. Moyles, for example, is expected to introduce a segment from his first ever breakfast show in the 1990s. But because the main station is focused on 15 to 24 years, programmes marking its history will only appear occasionally there. Controller Ben Cooper said that Radio 1 said that the celebration showed the underlying strength of a station whose history spans from Mike Read to Annie Mac and said it helped demonstrated that the station would be around for \u201canother 50-odd years\u201d despite the rise of YouTube, Spotify and other on demand services. \u201cBecause you have got those DJs that still have those great relationships with the audience, you are able to reflect back young people\u2019s culture. I think that means Radio 1 has a future not for the next few years but for another 50-odd years,\u201d he said. Figures for the first quarter of 2017 show Radio 1\u2019s reach fell from 9.9m listeners a week last year to 9.1m. There are few figures for Radio 1\u2019s early audiences, but in the first report published under the current Rajar system for measuring listeners in 1999, Radio 1 had a reach of 10.8m a week. In a time of growing choice for young people, Radio 1 believes it can offer an anchor for listeners \u2013 and that it can no longer simply be measured by listener figures. \u201cI am not worried because the industry needs to wake up and start judging success in different ways,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cI think Rajar gives you a narrow view of what is happening in the market place. To not take into account the fact that we have 1.2m views a day to our YouTube channel, to not take into account the 8.6m social media followers we have \u2013 there is something wrong there. \u201cAt a time of disaggregation for young people and so much choice, actually having a central point to gather around is probably more important than ever.\u201d The station controller said that the fact that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were keen to talk about mental health on Radio 1 and presenting its chart show showed the importance of the radio station. \u201cThey knew that coming to Radio 1 was important because Radio 1 still has that hold on being the soundtrack to peoples lives in the UK, it reflects the zeitgeist,\u201d he said. But Cooper said that the celebration would not look back at some of the station\u2019s darker history, including the sexual abuse charges and allegations against some of its former DJs, including Jimmy Savile. \u201cI think that part of Radio 1\u2019s history is well documented, so for obvious reasons we are not going to go there,\u201d Cooper said. Radio 1 will also mark the anniversary by hosting live performances every weekday in September. Live Lounge month will involve artists including Foo Fighters, Rag \u2019n\u2019 Bone Man and Royal Blood performing one of their songs and a cover of a song from the past 50 years in the Radio 1 studio. Radio 1 usually hosts only one or two Live Lounges a week. Radio 1 Vintage is designed to be a one-off, but the BBC has not ruled out becoming a permanent new radio station if it proves a success. \u201cThe idea is about it being a one-off digital pop-up,\u201d he said. \u201cThe BBC occasionally does it - we have done it with county music, we have done it with jazz, we did a collaboration with Jazz FM. The idea of these pop-ups is to promote digital listening.\u201d The first song played on the station was Flowers in the Rain by the Move, which peaked at number two in the charts. It will be played during Grimshaw and Blackburn\u2019s opening broadcast on the Vintage station."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
