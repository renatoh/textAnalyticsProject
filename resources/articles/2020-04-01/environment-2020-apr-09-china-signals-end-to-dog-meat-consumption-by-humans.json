Citing the \u201cprogress of human civilisation\u201d as well as growing public concern over animal welfare and prevention of disease transmission from animals to humans, China\u2019s Ministry of Agricultural and Rural Affairs singled out canines as forbidden in a draft \u201cwhite list\u201d of animals allowed to be raised for meat. The ministry called dogs a \u201cspecial companion animal\u201d and one not internationally recognised as livestock. The city of Shenzhen recently approved the first ever mainland China ban on consumption of dog and cat meat, a move that has given hope to animal welfare groups worldwide that other parts of the country could soon follow suit. The new draft policy has provided even more. \u201cThe signal is the first ever from a ministry that dogs are not food animals,\u201d Paul Littlefair, international head of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals told the Guardian. \u201c[This] leaves the door open for local governments to follow Shenzhen\u2019s lead.\u201d While not officially a ban on the consumption of dog meat, the draft policy from the agriculture ministry could be a \u201cgame changer moment for animal welfare in China\u201d, Wendy Higgins of Humane Society International (HSI) told the Guardian. \u201cThat signals a major shift, recognising that most people in China don\u2019t eat dogs and cats and want an end to the theft of their companion animals for a meat trade that only a small percentage of the population indulge in,\u201d Higgins said. HSI estimates that between 10 and 20 million dogs are killed in China for their meat annually, while Animals Asia puts the figure for cats at around 4 million per year. Most of these are stolen animals and not raised in captive breeding facilities, Higgins said. \u201cNot only does it cause enormous animal suffering, but it is also almost entirely fuelled by crime and, perhaps most significantly right now, poses an undeniable human health threat with the risk of diseases such as rabies and cholera,\u201d she said. The updated agriculture ministry list includes the addition of several wildlife species allowed to be farmed under animal husbandry laws if the policy is not altered following a public comment period that runs through May 8. Wildlife such as deer, game birds, along with mink, two kinds of foxes, and other animals were included on a list of animals expected to be approved as farm-raised species once China\u2019s central government lifts a ban on the wildlife trade. The temporary wildlife trade ban was imposed from late January in response to the Covid-19 outbreak, largely thought to have originated in the formal or illicit wildlife supply chain. But campaigners hope the government will go still further. Peter Li, China Policy Specialist with HSI, told the Guardian: \u201cListing wild animals, including foxes and raccoon dogs, as \u2018special livestock\u2019 is concerning. Rebranding wildlife as livestock doesn\u2019t alter the fact that there are insurmountable challenges to keeping these species in farm environments, their welfare needs simply can\u2019t be met. In addition, there\u2019s clear evidence that some of these species can act as intermediate hosts of viruses, such as Covid-19, which is why we\u2019re urging China and all governments to stop trading in wildlife.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
