It is real enough, unlike Lord Sugar\u2019s boardroom, which was purpose-built in a nearby studio; a cross between a Bond villain\u2019s lair and the Starship Enterprise, it is like a stage perfect for a late-capitalist panto. The Apprentice has now completed its 14th season. It is still trading on the cliches it created, still playing the bumbling venality of the contestants for laughs while trying to convince the viewer that something significant is at stake. Last week was the one where the five finalists are grilled about their business proposals and exposed as incompetent, deluded and untrustworthy \u2013 one more chance to call someone a \u201cprize imbecile\u201d to their face. This episode was the final, the one where they bring back all the old numpties to cock up the presentations of the two hopefuls \u2013 in this case, Sian and Camilla \u2013 competing for Lord Sugar\u2019s investment. Camilla\u2019s big idea was a range of dairy-free drinks made from nuts. Marketing-wise, her sensibility lies at the not-safe-for-work end of things, veering toward the sensual and non-consensual. She had been repeatedly advised to suppress this tendency, but when your product is called nut milk, the pitfalls are everywhere. Camilla impressed upon her branding team \u2013 Kayode, Tom and Jackie \u2013 the importance of staying just the right side of cheeky. In response, they came up with the slogan \u201cWipe your nuts\u201d. Sian\u2019s range of upmarket swimwear has one USP: it is reversible. Sadly, her branding brain trust put together a digital billboard that not only failed to mention this, but didn\u2019t even make it clear that the product in question was a swimming costume. Sian also wanted to keep it classy and they let her down badly. \u201cThat looked absolutely shite,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s be real.\u201d That, along with two not-very-good 30-second adverts, a questionable logo and a nut milk packaging design that put vegans in mind of cows, comprised the weapons that Sian and Camilla brought to their final presentations in front of a bunch of industry experts at City Hall. \u201cLet\u2019s get on with it,\u201d said Lord Sugar, perhaps echoing the sentiments of viewers who have stuck this series out. Unlike the episodes leading up to it, the final always allows a few glimpses of actual expertise: Sian was quite good at making swimwear and Camilla certainly knew a lot about nuts. But these moments were fleeting \u2013 the camera was too busy lingering on faces in search of hurt, discomfort and resentment, or a disdainful look from one of Lord Sugar\u2019s two lieutenants, Claude and Karren. It is never clear whether their eyerolls apply to the stupid thing just said, or whether they just save them up and sprinkle them about. By the end, Karren and Claude were singing the praises of the two finalists, an outbreak of regard that, in the context of all that has gone before, seemed to come from nowhere. There was one final trip to the boardroom, including a last chance for the two contenders to slag each other off \u2013 a reminder that, in business, the high road is never an option. And then somebody won. I can\u2019t tell you who, because they cut off the end bit of the preview version I watched. You will have heard by now; it was Sian or Camilla, if you were minded to care. Or maybe they both won, like last year. Remember that? Me neither. The Apprentice franchise has a lot to answer for, not least for creating a false aura of acumen around a New York real-estate hustler sufficient to get him elected president of the US. The UK version managed to furnish us with Katie Hopkins. Once upon a time, the charmlessness of its contestants was its main asset \u2013 the viewer was made to feel they deserved what they got \u2013 but I have begun to feel sorryfor them all, for being made to look foolish, for the slimness of their chances and the paltriness of the ultimate prize. The ratings for the show remain buoyant, so the BBC won\u2019t be dismantling that boardroom set any time soon. But, for me, at least \u2013 it feels like time to turn off the lights. And wipe your nuts on the way out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
