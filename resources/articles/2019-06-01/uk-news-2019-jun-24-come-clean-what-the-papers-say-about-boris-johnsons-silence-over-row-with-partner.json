The Guardian, the paper which first broke the story, says Johnson must answer questions about the incident, saying such scrutiny \u201cis not only appropriate. It is necessary\u201d. The Express says that senior Conservatives have \u201cpiled pressure on Boris Johnson to come clean about the screaming row\u201d. The i says it is not only Johnson\u2019s opponents, but also his supporters who are demanding \u201ca \u201cfull explanation after Tory frontrunner ducks questions about incident\u201d. The Daily Mail is more sympathetic to the Tory candidate, claiming he and Symonds have been driven out of their home and \u201ccan\u2019t return as flat is targeted by protests\u201d. The Mail says Johnson\u2019s \u201clatest imbroglio\u201d has \u201call the hallmarks of a stitch-up\u201d. But the paper says he \u201ccan\u2019t let it fester\u201d, adding: \u201cThe story is out there and millions are talking about it. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t need to be a soul-baring confessional. Just something to put the episode in its proper context. But until this controversy is settled, he will find it difficult to move on, not least because every interviewer will raise it until the election is over.\u201d The Telegraph is similarly in Johnson\u2019s corner, running a write-off of his weekly column as its lead story: \u201cBoris: I won\u2019t bottle Brexit\u201d. The Times voices sympathy for Johnson, saying such relationship difficulties are \u201cnever easy\u201d and he is \u201cnegotiating his in the public spotlight\u201d. But the paper says it was fair of his rival, Jeremy Hunt, to say that a candidate for prime minister \u201cshould answer questions on everything\u201d. \u201cMr Johnson should acknowledge that a potential prime minister will be scrutinised in personal as well as political life,\u201d the paper continues. \u201cEven so, provided Mr Johnson can answer those questions, Conservative MPs should be sympathetic to an aspirant leader who is mired in domestic turmoil. Break-ups happen. Voters are unlikely to be censorious. Prime ministers need not be perfect; they do need to be assiduous and competent.\u201d The Sun says Johnson should \u201cnip it in the bud\u201d as staying silent benefits those who want to \u201cbring him down\u201d. Its lead story is one from anonymous friends of the couple who say the fight on the weekend was the fourth in six weeks. The Mirror has its own anonymous \u201cpals\u201d and the paper reports they say that \u201cBoris \u2018wants to get back with his wife\u2019\u201d. The FT, the only paper not to splash on Boris Johnson today, leads with: \u201cLloyds froze 8,000 accounts amid offshore dirty-money crackdown\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
