Barcelona did not have to win this match. Manchester City did, or at least try to take something from it. But Barcelona had Lionel Messi, the one player in the world who seems capable of winning any Champions League match. No one needs to explain anything about Messi to anyone at City after all the previous meetings and the events at the Camp Nou, and though his appearance has changed considerably since the first glimpse in this country 10 years ago prompted Richard Williams of this parish to describe him as resembling the missing fifth member of the Monkees, the potency remains the same. When Messi scored the first goal here it was hard to know what was more remarkable, the certainty that he would find the net or the knowledge that it was his seventh goal in only three Champions League games this season. Guardiola\u2019s regard for Messi remains undiminished, and will do after this powerful reminder that one man does not make a team. City could consider themselves fortunate that Messi was not on the end of the opportunity from which Andr\u00e9 Gomes hit the bar midway through the second half, but if the key to stopping Barcelona is keeping Messi in check, Guardiola\u2019s side managed it. \u201cThere is no defence that can stop Messi,\u201d Guardiola famously told his Bayern Munich players when they had to attempt the task. \u201cYou can try and make sure he receives that ball less but there is no system or coach to stop talent of that magnitude.\u201d Put it down to an off-day, then. For though Barcelona turned up at the Etihad with a reorganised defence in the absence of Gerard Piqu\u00e9 and Jordi Alba, the front three were ominously as expected. This was only Messi\u2019s third Champions League game in the present campaign, so he was on a hat-trick of hat-tricks, having scored three goals against Celtic as well as three against Manchester City. Just in case anyone failed to notice him he was captain for the night too, as Andr\u00e9s Iniesta was sidelined through injury. Actually Barcelona missed Iniesta. That reliable presence just behind the front runners, the probing passes, the usual quiet control were not on display in the opening minutes. Messi\u2019s first touch of note was a ball into the box to pick out Luis Su\u00e1rez in a threatening position, though the only other Barcelona trademark to marvel at for the first quarter was a goalkeeper playing with his feet. As this is a hot topic in Manchester at the moment, it is worth noting that Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen\u2019s ball-playing ability is not restricted to wandering out of his area and making an occasional contribution as sweeper. Barcelona use him as an extra outfield player whether he is standing on his goalline or not. He has to field back-passes even when opponents are in close proximity and at one point dealt nervelessly with a free-kick played back to him at pace at waist height. Sweeper-keeping in the Premier League is clearly still in its infancy. Barcelona found their feet soon enough, though they could have had few complaints if City had been awarded a penalty for Samuel Umtiti\u2019s foul on Raheem Sterling with the game still scoreless. There was certainly enough contact for the referee\u2019s decision to book Sterling to look harsh, and City taking the lead at that point might have further unsettled their visitors. As it was, Barcelona claimed the first goal from a not entirely unexpected source. Messi not only scored it but helped make it, turning defence into attack when a Sergio Ag\u00fcero shot had been blocked, feeding the ball out to Neymar on the left then continuing his run through the middle to beat Willy Caballero with his usual left-foot nonchalance. It is perhaps a measure of City\u2019s improvement under Guardiola that they managed to come back from that before the interval. There were several more scares in Caballero\u2019s goalmouth, notably when Gomes saw a shot blocked and Su\u00e1rez could not quite reach Messi\u2019s volleyed cross with a header, but the home side were able to withstand the pressure until Ilkay G\u00fcndogan\u2019s goal put them back on terms. If Sergi Roberto was at fault for the equaliser it was Sergio Busquets who gave away the free-kick on David Silva from which Kevin De Bruyne gave City the lead, claiming to have won the ball but guilty of bundling over the man in the process. Then came Barcelona\u2019s best chance, Gomes crashing the ball against the bar after successive mistakes by John Stones and Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi, though in all fairness City were making chances for fun at the other end and could have made the game safe before G\u00fcndogan scored his second. Both defences were suspect, neither side was clinical in attack, there were opportunities aplenty in a game that at times was as knockabout as a Premier League match. Barcelona purists will probably regard that as an insult. City supporters can, however, quite rightly feel proud."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
