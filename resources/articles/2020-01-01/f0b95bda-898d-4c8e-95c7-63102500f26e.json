Danger! Danger!' Is Trump's team alarmed about their own case?", "bodyText": "\u201cDanger. Danger! DANGER!\u201d Jay Sekulow, a lawyer defending Donald Trump at his impeachment trial in the US Senate, turned himself into a human klaxon on Tuesday, repeating the word \u201cdanger\u201d 15 times. By his lights, Sekulow was warning Democrats of the danger of a partisan, politically motivated impeachment that would lower the bar for imposing the ultimate sanction \u2013 the political equivalent of the death penalty \u2013 on future presidents. But another interpretation would be that the combative attorney and talkshow host was warning Republicans of the danger allowing of John Bolton, the former national security adviser, to testify at the trial, potentially causing the president\u2019s entire defence to unravel. Sekulow\u2019s argument went something like this. Look, what Bolton says isn\u2019t true. But even if it was true, it\u2019s still not impeachable. Not that it is true, you understand. It really isn\u2019t. But let\u2019s just say, for the sake of argument, it was true. You still can\u2019t impeach for that. Got it? Am I clear? The trial had been going so well for the White House until the New York Times\u2019 weekend revelation that Bolton, in an upcoming book, writes that Trump did indeed make military aid to Ukraine conditional on the Ukrainian government announcing an investigation into his potential election rival, Joe Biden. Now there is a Capitol Hill clamour for Bolton to testify. The defence spent most of Monday avoiding the mustachioed elephant in the room until Alan Dershowitz \u2013 whose past clients include OJ Simpson, Jeffrey Epstein, Roman Polanski, Mike Tyson and Harvey Weinstein \u2013 finally uttered his name. Sekulow took up the cause on day seven of the trial. Standing at the lectern, with blue tie and blue pocket handkerchief, he began: \u201cWhat we are involved in here, as we conclude, is perhaps the most solemn of duties under our constitutional framework: the trial of the leader of the free world and the duly elected president of the United States. \u201cIt is not a game of leaks and unsourced manuscripts. That\u2019s politics, unfortunately, and [Alexander] Hamilton,\u201d \u2013 yes, him again \u2013 \u201cput impeachment in the hands of this body, the Senate, precisely and specifically to be above that fray. This is the greatest deliberative body on Earth.\u201d He added: \u201cIn our presentation so far, you\u2019ve now heard from legal scholars from a variety of schools of thought, from a variety of political backgrounds. But they do have a common theme with a dire warning: danger, danger, danger! \u201cTo lower the bar of impeachment based on these articles of impeachment would impact the functioning of our constitutional republic and the framework of that constitution for generations.\u201d It was a point he made over and over again. This attempt to take the moral high ground was pretty rich coming from a team that has pushed bogus conspiracy theories about Biden. Sekulow also repeatedly entreated senators to put themselves in Trump\u2019s shoes. Brimming with indignation, he ran through a parade of Fox News villains: the Steele dossier, FBI agents Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, Fisa warrants, former FBI director James Comey and special counsel Robert Mueller. The unspoken message was that Trump is the victim of deep state conspiracy. What, you may ask, did all this have to do with coercing Ukraine? Sekulow insisted: \u201cYou can\u2019t view this case in a vacuum. You are being asked to remove a duly elected president of the United States and you\u2019re being asked to do it in an election year.\u201d Indeed, Democrats would agree this is not occurring in a vacuum. During their presentation, House managers carefully explained how Trump\u2019s bullying of Ukraine, which is in constant peril from Russia, goes hand in hand with his peculiar affection for Vladimir Putin. Trump\u2019s phone call to Ukraine\u2019s president came a day after Mueller\u2019s congressional testimony. Inevitably, Sekulow griped about the backlash against his team\u2019s criticism of Biden and his son Hunter, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. \u201cDo we have, like, a Biden-free zone?\u201d he demanded. \u201cYou can impeach a president for asking a question?\u201d Then he returned to the Bolton imbroglio. Sekulow dismissed \u201can unpublished manuscript that maybe some reporters have an idea of maybe what it says ... I don\u2019t know what you\u2019d call that. I\u2019d call it inadmissible, but that\u2019s what it is \u2026 You cannot impeach a president on an unsourced allegation.\u201d Sekulow quoted Trump and Mike Pence\u2019s office denying Bolton\u2019s allegation. He warned against an impeachment based on policy differences. Democrats looked underwhelmed. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota whispered behind her hand to Chris Coons of Delaware, who smiled. Again that cry of \u201cDanger, danger, danger!\u201d Klobuchar sighed. Meanwhile, Senator Mitt Romney, among those who may well vote to call Bolton and other witnesses, was reportedly told off for breaking Senate rules by bringing in a bottle of chocolate milk. He later came back with it in a glass instead. In what may come to look like wild overconfidence, the defence rested its case after using less than half its allotted 24 hours. Clips of Democrats warning against the Bill Clinton impeachment two decades ago were played, culminating with Chuck Schumer, now Senate minority leader, saying: \u201cMy fear is that when a Republican wins the White House, Democrats will demand payback.\u201d The White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, looked at Schumer and said: \u201cYou were right.\u201d The senator\u2019s face remained a mask frozen with a bemused smile. But this could not be described as a barnstorming finish. Cipollone claimed they had made a \u201ccompelling case\u201d and pleaded for senators to \u201crespect and defend the sacred right of every American to vote and to choose their president\u201d a few months from now. There was an outbreak of muttering among Democrats. It was as if, collectively, they were saying: is that all you got?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
