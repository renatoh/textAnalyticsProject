The money can be paid to them without the delay of it going through your estate. There will also be no inheritance tax to be paid on it, even if you are worth more than the \u00a3242,000 IHT threshold. This is particularly important for single people or for those in gay relationships. If you are married, the trustees will almost automatically send the money to your spouse and children. But for a single, childless person, for instance, the trustees will know that you want the cash to go to the nominated person rather than to your parents or other legal heirs. This could be particularly important with the new 'stakeholder' pensions, aimed at low and middle earners. Legal &amp; General is typical of the large providers in asking people to nominate a recipient as part of its stakeholder application form.If you do not see such questions on your form, write a letter to the scheme outlining your wishes. Solicitor Tom Collinge of Hammond Suddards Edge, and author of Tolley's Stakeholder Pensions: A Practical Guide, suggests giving your full name, date of birth and address as well. 'Lack of detail can be a problem,' he says. 'It's useful to make sure that there are ways of identifying the person.' This is especially important if your loved one has a widely used name, such as John Smith or Jane Brown. And if your nominee moves you should give the scheme his or her new address. Sim ilar issues can arise if you die while your pension is being paid. If you have bought an annuity you will have chosen one that pays out during your lifetime, or a more expensive one that covers you and your partner. A joint annuity can cover a same-sex partner, according to the Annuity Bureau, but you would want to be able to prove that you were dependent on each other financially. Similarly, if you are in a company final salary scheme, you should know - or be able to read up on - the terms of widow's, widower's and dependents' pensions. Some schemes are very traditional, while some now accept the rights of non-married and same-sex partners. However, one in five private sector schemes will not pay a pension to a common law partner, and half will not pay benefits to dependents in same-sex relationships, according to the National Association of Pension Funds. The Rainbow Massow Group of independent financial advisers specialises in the gay sector. Staff there believe that pension and death benefit arrangements for the homosexual community are improving . They have just set up a Freedom Pension, which is explicitly targeted at this sector. The right to nominate a partner is highlighted and the investment funds are filtered by fund managers NPI and Friends Provident so that they go into businesses with good equal opportunities policies. The scheme was launched at the equality dinner held by the Stonewall campaign group.
