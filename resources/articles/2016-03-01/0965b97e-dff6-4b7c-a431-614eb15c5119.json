Mullins and Ruby Walsh were combining for their fourth success this week and Walsh is now just one away from a half-century of Festival victories. He thoroughly earned his share of the prize money, with a brave and ground-saving ride around the inside. Yorkhill could be spotted travelling with enormous promise from a long way out but the question was whether he would get a run through. When a gap of sorts came on the final bend, Yorkhill coasted through it, pinching a three-length lead by the final flight. Yanworth, on whom Barry Geraghty had been at least three horse-widths wider for almost the whole race, stayed on dourly but was still a length and three-quarters adrift at the line. \u201cI did have chasing in mind for him but I\u2019m not so sure now,\u201d Mullins said of Yorkhill. \u201cI\u2019d be minded now to go down the Champion Hurdle route. If Ruby thinks he\u2019s smart enough for that, we\u2019ll go there. \u201cWhen you see the way my Champion Hurdle horses fell like flies this year,\u201d he said in reference to the injured Faugheen and Arctic Fire, \u201cit\u2019s tough racing and I would love to have another super-sub like Annie Power.\u201d Yorkhill is a 10-1 shot for next year\u2019s Champion, behind Faugheen, Annie Power and Nicky Henderson\u2019s Altior. Alan King, trainer of Yanworth, admitted to disappointment but was not inclined to make excuses and said the better horse won. \u201cThat\u2019s the first proper race he has had and he might just improve for it. It\u2019s the first time he\u2019s had a kick in the belly.\u201d King will consider sending the six-year-old over fences next winter. Nigel Twiston-Davies, apparently \u201cmiserable\u201d in the aftermath of The New One\u2019s Champion Hurdle defeat, was cheered by a double here, starting with Blaklion\u2019s surprise success in the RSA Chase. \u201cI really thought The New One would win,\u201d the trainer said, \u201cand all you press people were right, he\u2019s not quite quick enough \u2026 I\u2019m so sorry! I wanted to die last night but today makes it all right.\u201d Blaklion has kept improving since taking a tumble here in November, which Twiston-Davies now feels was a helpful part of his development. \u201cHe\u2019s learned a bit of sense. They think they\u2019re kings and you just have a fall \u2026 it makes them think: \u2018Oh, I can\u2019t be so flippant, I\u2019ll be more careful.\u2019 And now he\u2019s magic, isn\u2019t he?\u201d No More Heroes, fourth in the RSA, was found to have struck into himself, severing a tendon, possibly as far from home as the third-last. Connections reported that the injury was such that the horse would not race again but that they hoped to save him and that he was being treated at a local equine hospital. Eddie O\u2019Leary, spokesman for the owners, Gigginstown Stud, said: \u201cUnfortunately the injury to No More Heroes was a career-ending one. Everything will be done to try to save him.\u201d Twiston-Davies\u2019s day got better when Ballyandy took the Champion Bumper under the trainer\u2019s son, Sam. The winner, who held off the Mullins-trained Battleford by a nose, has some of the same qualities as Imperial Commander, Twiston-Davies\u2019s Gold Cup winner, at least in the eyes of their trainer. Course officials decided to water the track on Wednesday night to prevent it from drying out any further from the current description of \u201cgood, good to soft in places\u201d. Most of the track was due to be irrigated, with the current week-long dry spell expected to last until the Festival\u2019s conclusion on Friday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
