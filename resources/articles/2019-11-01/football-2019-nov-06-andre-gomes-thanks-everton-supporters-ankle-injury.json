The 26-year-old Portugal midfielder sustained a fracture-dislocation of his right ankle during the club\u2019s 1-1 draw with Tottenham on Sunday but the surgery he underwent on Monday has been declared a success and the long\u2011term prognosis seems cautiously optimistic. On Wednesday, Everton\u2019s manager, Marco Silva, reported everything had gone well while Gomes was able to provide his first public comments via social media. \u201cI\u2019m already at home with my family and I would like to thank you all for the support, the messages and the positive energy,\u201d he said. \u201cThank you.\u201d Gomes is expected to be out of action for up to a year in the wake of an incident that left players from both sides visibly upset but although some tough days will inevitably lie ahead there is genuine confidence he will return to the first team. \u201cHe is doing well,\u201d said Silva. \u201cThe surgery went really well and all the feedback we\u2019ve had was really good. Andr\u00e9 is home now with all the support of our medical staff but he was with us here yesterday at Finch Farm. \u201cIt was really good for everyone to see him, to have that first contact with him after that tough moment for all of us. Now is a moment for us to support him, to give all of our best to have Andr\u00e9 back as soon as possible. \u201cWe have to be patient, we have to go step by step but for sure the support everyone will give him and good work we should do as a club with our medical staff, rehab people as well, will create the conditions for Andr\u00e9 to be successful.\u201d Silva has few doubts about Gomes\u2019s capacity to confront the challenges of the next few months. \u201cI know how Andr\u00e9 is as a professional. I am 100% sure he will work really hard to become stronger. I don\u2019t have doubts about that. \u201cUnfortunately for Andr\u00e9 it was a really tough moment and now will come the rehab. Andr\u00e9 has had some injuries in the past, not so tough and serious, but he won that challenge. And it will be the same again, I don\u2019t have doubts. He will become stronger as a football player but more as a man.\u201d Silva said that Gomes had received get-well messages from far and wide. \u201cThey show the big respect everyone has for Andr\u00e9. Not just as a football player, everyone recognises how he\u2019s a very good player, at the top, top level. He\u2019s a really, really good professional. Everyone loves him in our club and everyone around the world was really supportive of him.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
