The page has put together the \u201cnational dishes\u201d of the countries participating. Snuggled among machboos for Kuwait and sushi for Japan is the meat pie for Australia. The question of whether the pie truly is our national dish has been live for decades, perhaps ever since English agriculture displaced Indigenous diets during colonisation. Egypt is actually one of the first countries to have dined on the meat pie. It was a common dish in northern Europe since at least the 1300s, when it began to take the form we are so familiar with today. Kangaroo is always a contender, and though Australia may be the only country to eat one of its national emblems, it\u2019s not popular enough to gain national dish status. Barbecued anything could surely be a favourite on any bookie\u2019s list \u2013 though America\u2019s south may have a stronger claim \u2013 and pavlova, as any Australian worth their Vegemite knows, is actually a Kiwi dish. So we will throw it over to you, what\u2019s Australia\u2019s national dish?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
