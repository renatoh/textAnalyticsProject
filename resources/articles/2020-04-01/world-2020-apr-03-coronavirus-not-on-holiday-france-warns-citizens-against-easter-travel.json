Checkpoints are being set up on all major roads and motorways out of towns and cities with orders to turn back those attempting to break the rules. Officials in areas popular with holidaymakers, or where there are high proportions of second homes, have also been ordered to carry out checks to ensure there is no sudden influx of visitors. \u201cThe virus is not on holiday,\u201d said the French prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, in a televised address on Thursday evening. Philippe was echoing the interior minister, Christophe Castaner, who hours earlier warned: \u201cAbsolutely do not go on holiday during the lockdown period \u2026 People must remain confined. Any abuse will be punished.\u201d Laurent Nu\u00f1ez, the transport minister, also issued stern instructions on Friday morning, saying an extra 60,000 police and gendarmes would join the 100,000 normally on duty in order to carry out \u201cintense checks\u201d on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. \u201cYou cannot leave your home to go to a resort or a second home,\u201d Nu\u00f1ez told RTL radio. \u201cThere will be no leaving for holiday \u2026 There will be checks across the country. Considerable numbers of police and gendarmes will be put in place mostly checking on the ground but also from the air.\u201d Nu\u00f1ez said those who tried to escape the lockdown could face more than fines and warned \u201cthose who want to challenge the restrictions\u201d repeatedly would be committing a crime. \u201cAfter three infractions \u2013 that\u2019s to say from the fourth time of not respecting the confinement \u2013 it becomes a crime,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not a road traffic misdemeanour, it\u2019s the non respect of a regulation.\u201d France\u2019s two-week Easter holiday begins on Friday evening and is staggered over four weeks in three different zones; the first zone includes Paris and Toulouse. Police are also being sent to railway stations and airports, but services have been decimated during the lockdown. Paris\u2019s police chief, Didier Lallement, said 8,277 extra \u201cofficers and gendarmes\u201d would be on duty to stop \u201cthose who persist in their stupid plans\u201d. He told them: \u201cWe\u2019ll be there when you leave, during the journey and when you arrive.\u201d Since the French lockdown began on 17 March, 5.8 million people have been stopped and asked for papers showing they are authorised to be away from home, Castaner said. About 359,000 fines have been issued."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
