Clement had been sent off for a professional foul on Luis Boa Morte then became embroiled in the fracas which saw the Fulham striker Andy Cole dismissed for violent conduct. He has already served the statutory one-match ban for the original offence but the referee Mike Dean had reported him to the Football Association for aggravating conduct in not leaving the pitch immediately. An FA disciplinary panel studied video evidence before finding Clement guilty of violent conduct during a hearing at Soho Square. He escaped a fine but the ban begins with immediate effect against Bolton on Saturday and he will also miss the key games with Norwich City and Crystal Palace. Tottenham's Argentinian defender Mauricio Taricco has been banned for three matches for his clash with the Chelsea winger Damien Duff nearly six months ago. Taricco had been charged with violent conduct after appearing to hit Duff with his hand and Scott Parker with his forearm during Spurs' 1-0 defeat on April 3. Neither incident had been punished by the referee and disciplinary action was subject to the older, more time-consuming procedural regulations. After a personal hearing, Taricco was found guilty of the incident involving Duff but a charge of improper conduct towards Parker was not proved. He will miss Spurs' games against Everton, Portsmouth and Bolton. Youri Djorkaeff is on the verge of becoming a Blackburn player - until January at least. He will become Mark Hughes's first signing since he succeeded Graeme Souness as manager. The 36-year-old is a free agent after his contract with Bolton expired in the summer and his agent, Willie McKay, said yesterday: \"The deal will be done by tomorrow. The final paperwork will be sorted out and he will be having a medical in the morning. Football Association board members are expected to draw up a shortlist for the chief executive's position - vacated by Mark Palios when he resigned in the summer - at Soho Square today. Among the candidates for the position are believed to be the former Fifa general secretary Michael Zen-Ruffinen and the former Chelsea chief executive Trevor Birch."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
