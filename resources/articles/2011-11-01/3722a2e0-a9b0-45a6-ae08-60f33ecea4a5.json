Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's team beat Borussia Dortmund, the German champions, 2-1 at the Emirates Stadium to secure top place in Group F. Arsenal have won five of their past six Premier League games to rise to seventh, following a poor start to the season. Wilshere, who has an ankle injury, is one of three first-choice players who are unavailable. Bacary Sagna (ankle) and Kieran Gibbs (hernia) are the other two. Song, whose dribble and cross created Robin van Persie's first goal against Dortmund, said: \"Jack is a very good player and we need everyone. When we have everyone fit we are more strong and confident. We need every player because we have a lot of games. We don't just think about if Jack is coming, everyone has their job to do in the team. That is why it is important Jack will come back soon.\" Song discussed the difficulties that were caused by Arsenal losing Cesc F\u00e1bregas to Barcelona and Samir Nasri to Manchester City in the summer. He said: \"When everyone comes back we will see another Arsenal play because when we started we lost two big players and it was not easy to have players like Cesc and Nasri missing. They were big players for us, very important. But in football it happens all the time. You need to forget about it and give confidence to the players we have got.\" Arsenal have welcomed some players back from injury \u2013 Abou Diaby returned to the team against Dortmund. \"Today we are happy about it, we have some players missing like Jack and Abou has come back,\" said Song. \"[Tomas] Rosicky is injured. When everyone comes back we will be very good and more strong. \"We started very badly and it is not easy when you have new players coming in. You need to give them time and we see that we are not like three, four months ago. We manage very well and play very well and we try to help each out. \"Maybe some people are very hard on Arsenal \u2013 I don't know why. We are just trying to do the job and we are happy to have [beaten Dortmund] and shown everyone that [what they] said was wrong. Everything is working and we don't want just to keep it like this, we want to look forward.\" Arsenal play Fulham at home in the league on Saturday before Manchester City visit the Emirates for a Carling Cup quarter-final on Tuesday. Song said: \"When you play for a team like Arsenal you want just to finish all the time the top on the league. We have the Carling Cup soon and we have to win every game. We take it game by game and now we have to rest. \"We know it is very important for us to finish the job well [in the Champions League] because to win the group is important. That is why we are happy because we need to rest and follow the league now.\" Song was not sure if Wenger was pleased that Cameroon have not qualified for the Africa Cup of Nations in January. \"You will have to ask him but for me it is not good because Cameroon is one of the big teams in Africa,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
