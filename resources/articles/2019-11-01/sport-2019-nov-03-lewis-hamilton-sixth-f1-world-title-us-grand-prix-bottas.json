Number six gives the 34-year-old sole ownership of second place on the all-time list. The greatest driver of his generation has overtaken Juan Manuel Fangio, whose championships came in the 1950s, leaving him one behind Michael Schumacher. Few would bet against Hamilton equalling the German next year, given the Briton\u2019s relentless desire for self-improvement. Hamilton said that even in his thirteenth F1 season his career remains a work in progress. \u201cI\u2019m working on a masterpiece and I haven\u2019t quite finished it yet, so I\u2019m trying to understand. It takes a long time to master a craft and, whilst I feel like I am mastering it, there\u2019s still more to master, still more to add to it, more pieces to the puzzle to add, more ups and downs along the way. But I feel like I\u2019ve got the best tools now, up to this point at least,\u201d he said. Hamilton paid tribute to Niki Lauda, the three-time champion who acted as an advisor to Mercedes. He died in May aged 70. \u201cIt\u2019s been the hardest year for us as a team. We lost Niki this year, a real crucial and pivotal member of our team,\u201d Hamilton said. Despite his unassailable lead in the standings with two races still to come, Hamilton has won only two of the past seven races after eight victories in the first 12. \u201cIt\u2019s been a real challenge, the second half of the season. It\u2019s been the toughest second half of the season I think we\u2019ve had as a team,\u201d he said, paying tribute to his Mercedes squad for \u201cout-thinking\u201d Ferrari, who arguably had advantages in power and straight-line speed. One minor blemish is the relative lack of pole positions \u2013 four so far compared with 11 in 2018 \u2013 though Hamilton said that, while he has not dominated in qualifying, he has at least been consistent. \u201cOtherwise I think it\u2019s been the best performing year,\u201d he said. Only his teammate, Valtteri Bottas, could have delayed the date of Hamilton\u2019s coronation, so it was fitting that the two fought hard for first place in Austin, duelling in the closing stages as Bottas successfully chased down the Briton. Bottas, second in the standings, had to win from pole and hope Hamilton finished outside the top eight at a venue where he habitually excels. The 30-year-old Finn did what was required but so did Hamilton, with a solid, composed and determined drive on a bumpy surface. The result was especially impressive given that he started in fifth but he rose to third before the end of the first lap, surging past the struggling Ferraris of Sebastian Vettel and Charles Leclerc. Suspension woes forced Vettel out of the race on lap eight. The afternoon soon settled into a three-way tussle between Bottas, Hamilton and the Red Bull of Max Verstappen. Hamilton was on a one-stop strategy, with Bottas and Verstappen adopting two-stop tactics, making the outcome hard to predict. Hamilton enjoyed a roughly three-second advantage entering the final 10 laps of the 56-lap race but Bottas was steadily gaining ground on fresher tyres and he overtook his teammate on lap 52. Hamilton had just enough left to hold off Verstappen in the final stages. The inevitable question now is whether he can catch Schumacher. \u201cI\u2019ve always said to you that reaching Michael never was a target for me. I\u2019m not really one that thinks of records and those kind of things. I definitely had thought that getting anywhere near Michael was just so far-fetched,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe that I have the ability to continue to grow and to do more with this team.\u201d Rather than look too far into the future, Hamilton preferred to cast his mind back to the past. He recalled sitting at home with his father, Anthony, watching races on television and eating bacon sandwiches. Anthony was in the cheering crowd beneath the podium after this race, standing next to the cowboy-hatted Texan actor, Matthew McConaughey, who gave Hamilton a hearty hug. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond surreal, that my life journey has brought me to this point in winning the sixth title. I don\u2019t really know how I\u2019m supposed to feel,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in the whole Cloud Nine thing but I\u2019m flying super high right now.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
