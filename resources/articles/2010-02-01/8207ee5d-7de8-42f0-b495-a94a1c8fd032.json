In an event held at the company's headquarters in Mountain View, California, the search engine announced a new product \u2013 Google Buzz \u2013 that draws on elements of Facebook, MySpace and Twitter, and creates what senior executives called \"the poster child\" for the company's future. Buzz \u2013 which is based around the company's Gmail web email service \u2013 allows users to start sharing information, photographs, videos and messages with each other, as well as see what is happening around them through their mobile phones. While such features are already the fashion for social networking sites, the company said that moving into this area was vitally important to Google's future. \"We're launching this today because we're just getting started,\" said Bradley Horowitz, the company's vice president of product marketing. \"There's so much opportunity, we can wire this up in so many ways to other parts of Google, other parts of the internet.\" Instead of forcing users to hunt for their friends online, Buzz uses information from their existing email accounts to automatically show updates and media from people they talk to regularly \u2013 though it also allows people to share information privately if they want. Google is hoping that it can convince users of Gmail, which has more than 150 million users worldwide, to start using Buzz \u2013 something that could automatically slingshot it past MySpace to become the world's second-largest social network. The move brings Google into closer conflict with a number of smaller rivals than ever before. Although the company remains the most powerful force on the web \u2013 and has even seen profits from its internet advertising business continue to rise despite the recession \u2013 it has also been feeling increasing pressure from competitors that have tapped into a desire to connect with friends and family online. Facebook, which celebrated its sixth anniversary last week, now boasts more than 400 million users worldwide and has becoming the homepage of choice for many people. Social messaging service Twitter, meanwhile, remains one of the hottest internet startups around and is expanding quickly. To combat this groundswell of activity, Google has already started rolling out a number of new features for its main search engine \u2013 incorporating new features such as photos from your friends and real-time messages from a range of sites. But the company's previous attempts to harness social activity on the web have not proved particularly successful: Orkut, a social networking site the company launched in 2004, has a significant number of users in countries like Brazil but has failed to make inroads elsewhere. Meanwhile Google Wave, a product previewed last year that combines email, instant messaging and social networking, remains in testing. Co-founder Sergey Brin said that the company's social experiments had been more successful than it was given credit for \u2013 but that Buzz would be more than just talking with friends and playing games. \"I think that social services on the internet have undergone a number of revolutions and significant expansions over time,\" he said. \"There will always be competitors, and will continue to be. But I hope the trend will continue, and we'll make our own contribution.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
