Verdict: \"The top three ways to improve RI:SE : 3) Let viewers vote off one presenter a week. 2) Kirsty Gallacher's Topless Sports Round-Up. 1) Start each show with a close-up of a TV screen showing a video of classic Big Breakfast moments, hold shot for two hours.\" Garry Bushell, the Sunday People Mr Right, ITV1 It was so bad, it was almost good. Almost, but not quite. Just 2 million people watched the final in a late-night graveyard slot in November. Verdict: \"Mr Right is a tawdry and tacky dating game show which would be a pitiful addition to ITV's dismal schedules at the best of times.\" Daily Express Linda Green, BBC1 The first episode of the new run was watched by 5.8m viewers, But its ratings slumped by 2m to just 3.8 million a fortnight later. Verdict: \"One amusing quip in half an hour, I'm afraid, was quite insufficient to persuade me to double the time I'd already wasted on Ms Green.\" Peter Paterson, Daily Mail Stan the Man, ITV1 Ended the year being watched by just 1.5 million viewers. Verdict: \"Alas, Stan's no original, as Arthur Daley and Del Boy Trotter so impressively were.\" Hilary Kingsley, Mail on Sunday Fame Academy, BBC1 7.7 million viewers tuned in to watch Friday's grand finale - half Pop Idol's audience. But it was the series highlight. Just 4.5 million tuned into the opening episode, only four shows out of more than 31 on BBC1 had more than 6 million viewers and the low point came with just 3.3 million bothering to tune in. Verdict: \"It is worrying that a public-service broadcaster has been so eager to exploit public weakness, and even more worrying that they pumped this stuff into children's brains.\" Robert Hanks, the Independent Live with Chris Moyles, Channel 5 The loudmouth DJ's first foray into TV has struggled to reach a regular audience of more than 400,000 viewers on Channel 5 at teatime. Verdict: \"At some lost point of Monday's Live With Chris Moyles its host chuckled to his audience that he was getting paid \"\u00a347 and a taxi ride home\" for presenting the show. To which the reasonable and obvious response was: Channel 5, you have been grievously ripped off.\" Ally Ross, News of the World Forever Summer with Nigella Lawson, Channel 4 The first episode of Nigella Lawson's latest cookery show for Channel 4 attracted an audience of just 1.3 million and ended with an unimpressive 900,000 viewers in October. Verdict: \"It was 20 minutes before she promised to get her 'little gems' out, and even then they turned out to be lettuces. She's also started dressing a bit frumpy. Bad idea. Sort it out, love. Do you really think we were watching for the recipes?\" Ian Hyland, Sunday Mirror Formula one racing, ITV1 ITV1's formula one coverage was beaten by BBC2's coverage of Paula Radcliffe's victory in the Chicago marathon and the final of snooker's LG Cup. Michael Schumacher's string of predictable wins saw just 600,000 viewers for ITV1's live last race of the season. Verdict: \"'According to Bernie Eccleston, [falling television audience] has now started in the last few races to be quite serious and he is getting complaints from television companies.\" Max Mosley, president of formula one's governing body FIA Audley Harrison, BBC The BBC criticised Harrison's attitude towards promotional work with the BBC and the press in general after signing a \u00a31m deal with the corporation. Verdict: \"The BBC are concerned that their high profile signing of Harrison has gone wrong, with viewing figures sharply down from his opening bout in May last year - not helped by the problems encountered by many journalists wishing to interview him or get information.\" John Dillon, the Express Johnny Vaughan, BBC1 Just 2.1m viewers watched the debut show on January 7 but it slid down to just above the 1m mark. Verdict: \"Vaughan needs people to bounce off, and to fill the gaps while he's thinking ahead to the next gag. Here, as in his dreary sitcom, 'Orrible, a script seemed to leave him floundering, unsure how to fill the pauses Robert Hank, the Independent"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
