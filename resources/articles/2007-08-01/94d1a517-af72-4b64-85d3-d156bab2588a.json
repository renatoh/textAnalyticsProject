Every year thousands of visitors walk a quarter of a mile and 5,000 years back through time along the signposted path from the tourist centre to the preserved Neolithic village built by farmers between 3,100 and 2,450BC. Almost every small step for man records a moment of history, from the building of the Pyramids and the birth of Christ to Magna Carta and the Apollo moon landings - and that's the problem. Islanders have been surprised to hear that the Russian ambassador has contacted staff at the Historic Scotland site to plead for equal billing for the former Soviet Union's own space-race triumphs. Alongside the 1969 moon landing, the Russians requested that the 1957 launch of Sputnik, the first artificial satellite, and Yuri Gagarin, the first man to orbit the earth in 1961, should also be honoured. 'It's true,' said local tour guide John Grieve who last year sparked the debate when he was showing Russian film and television director Alexander Korobko, of the Russian Hour satellite TV programme, around the island. 'Mr Korobko was ... surprised, and a little put out, that the American moon landings were marked on the timeline but there's nothing about the Soviet achievements. He said he was going to try and get some support for a plaque to at least honour the first man in space, and it looks as though he has.' Korobko visited the site as part of a film, 'Who Am I?', after the discovery that his DNA was closely linked to the islanders'. For several days he filmed Orkney, its people and culture as he investigated the community's links with Russia. \"I discovered by chance that one of my own ancestors was Orcadian while doing research for another TV feature, and so I decided to travel to Orkney,'said Korobko. 'I also noticed on a trail near Skara Brae that there is one milestone missing, that of 'the first man in space'. I would love for the Russian Hour to sponsor such a stone to commemorate the first man in space, Russia's very own Yuri Gagarin.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
