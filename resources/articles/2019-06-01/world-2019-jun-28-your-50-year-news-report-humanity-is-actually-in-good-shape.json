Well, despite today\u2019s mood of crisis, pessimism, alarm and antagonism, the semicentennial 2019 edition would probably be pretty upbeat. In the 50 years since we landed on the moon (and since I was born) progress down here on Earth has been stellar. We\u2019ve made remarkable advances in tackling poverty and child mortality, as the world\u2019s economy has grown more than thirtyfold since the giant leap for mankind. When it comes to public health, we\u2019ve either eradicated (smallpox) or driven back (guinea worm, polio, malaria, sleeping sickness) a whole textbook of diseases, and fought back strongly against some of the most deadliest of all, including HIV and cancer. (This week, Sarah Boseley discovered great hope for the battle against cervical cancer). We have more people in work than ever \u2013 and despite current pangs, democracy is still winning as a numbers game, with more people voting in elections in 2019 than at any point in history. And while we\u2019re comparing 2019 with 1969, the festival scene has come a long way since Woodstock, and is now probably greener than ever. Of course there are challenges. There always have been. Humanity has doubled in number since 1969 (when I was born there were 3.528 billion people alive \u2013 check your number here.) We are overusing resources, leading to big environmental and biodiversity crises. Yet since 1969 we have learned to harness energy from sun, moon and wind. (This week, Oliver Milman reported that the US generated more electricity from renewables than from coal for the first time). We are an ageing species \u2013 more than 1 billion of us are over 60. But we are ingenious too, for ever thinking up new ways to face down this challenge. Of course, there\u2019s still Trump, Brexit, Iran, Johnson, Hong Kong, Putin, austerity. But will we still be writing about them in 50 years\u2019 time? Lucky numbers Still playing with the rather arbitrary 50-year theme, air pollution may be a serious health hazard in parts of the world today, but in many places it\u2019s actually better than it was. In the UK, you\u2019re far less likely to die because of nasty stuff in the air than you were in 1970. What we liked The family spending a year volunteering in Europe, as reported by our friends at Positive News. Also this piece examining how the green new deal might change the US\u2019s built space. What we heard Mary Bomford wrote to us on the theme of waste and recycling: Lots of bad news about how recycling goes nowhere. Check out how it is done in Canada in the province of British Columbia. Alan Robertshaw, meanwhile, sees potential for an ancient technology to make a big comeback: I would like to suggest a subject ie the reintroduction of sail into commercial shipping. The latter is currently a large contributor to the climate emergency as well as being a serious polluter of the oceans, issues which need to be addressed. Whilst initially a return to sail may seem retrograde and old school, this is not actually the case. We\u2019ve had a go at this subject before, but perhaps it is worth a second look. Future sailors indeed. Where was the Upside? In Catania, where Lorenzo Tondo showed us that refugees are far more than just uprooted unfortunates. Did you get to the bottom? Well done!
