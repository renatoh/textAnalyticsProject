Mourinho\u2019s line came to mind after more ruthless finishing from Sergio Ag\u00fcero rescued a barely deserved point for Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s stuttering title challengers at Upton Park, leaving West Ham United with the rare sensation of feeling disappointed after failing to secure their first league double over City in 53 years. West Ham led twice, only for Ag\u00fcero to cancel out Enner Valencia\u2019s snappy double with two goals of his own, and there is a temptation to praise City for mounting spirited fightbacks from a goal down in both halves. Scoring an 81st minute equaliser at the home of a team who relish bloodying the noses of opponents with superior resources is usually interpreted as a sign of belief, resolve and togetherness. Scratch the surface, however, and City\u2019s wide range of flaws soon begin to emerge. They were evident as early as the first minute, when Cheikhou Kouyat\u00e9 tore past a half-hearted challenge from Yaya Tour\u00e9 in the build-up to West Ham\u2019s opener, and they materialised again in the 56th minute, amateurish defending allowing Valencia to score his second after the striker muscled on to a huge throw from Michail Antonio. The beaten Joe Hart made no attempt to hide his displeasure with his defence. City badly miss the assurance of their captain, Vincent Kompany, and Pellegrini was unable to say when the Belgian centre-back will return from his latest calf injury. Nicolas Otamendi was embarrassed by Valencia for the second goal and Mart\u00edn Demichelis was fortunate not to be sent off for a cynical challenge on Antonio in the first half. Playing alongside Fabian Delph, Tour\u00e9\u2019s failings were exposed by West Ham, who are sixth after a run of one defeat in 10 matches. Alex Song was dominant in midfield and Dimitri Payet\u2019s skill took the breath away. Pellegrini\u2019s defence of Tour\u00e9 was as convincing as Otamendi\u2019s attempt to stop Valencia. \u201cHe played today as a defensive midfielder,\u201d Pellegrini said. \u201cI think that Yaya played in that position without any problem.\u201d That was a generous assessment. Yet the defensive deficiencies do not tell the full story. In the league, City have not had consecutive victories since October and have won one of their past eight away games. For all Ag\u00fcero\u2019s opportunism, they drifted after going 2-1 down. David Silva faded after a promising start, Kevin de Bruyne could not shake off Sam Byram and Jes\u00fas Navas was shackled by Aaron Cresswell. Raheem Sterling\u2019s impact as a substitute was minimal. At least Kelechi Iheanacho was bright after replacing Delph, his driving run leading to Ag\u00fcero nonchalantly making it 2-2. \u201cThey put us under pressure,\u201d Slaven Bilic said. \u201cWe were under pressure but the good point is, let\u2019s say second half, when we beat them at the Etihad 2-1, second half, it was the Alamo, it was like them, them, them. We were kicking the ball out. This was like, with our quality, we were also keeping the ball, we were stretching them.\u201d Yet, although City lacked hunger and purpose, they remain three points off the top. They are playing within themselves and they may only require a slight improvement to win the league, especially if Ag\u00fcero stays fit. The best striker in England has started 2016 with six goals in six matches. \u201cThe last problem was when he was with his national squad\u201d Pellegrini said. \u201cHe scored four times against Newcastle and I changed him as he was feeling some problems. Unfortunately he played for his national squad three or four days after and he had a muscle injury. So I hope now that he is 100% fit and he does not have any problem and it is very important that the team plays with him in every game. \u201cIn the first 23 games, in the 11 players who played the most minutes, we don\u2019t have Ag\u00fcero, Silva, Kompany. I hope that in the second part of the season they will be involved in all the games because they are very important.\u201d Man of the match Alex Song (West Ham United)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
