We don\u2019t have that spirit\u2019", "bodyText": "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho attacked the meekness of most of Manchester United\u2019s players as his team fell two goals behind to Southampton before coming back to equalise. The comeback did not go far enough and the manager accepted a 2-2 draw amounted to two more points dropped. United started sluggishly at St Mary\u2019s and found themselves two down within 20 minutes after excellent strikes by Stuart Armstrong by Cedric Soares. They were in danger of being beaten by a team who have not won at home all season until Marcus Rashford \u2013 United\u2019s one \u201cmad dog\u201d, according to Mourinho \u2013 inspired a fightback, creating goals for Romelu Lukaku and Ander Herrera before the break. The second half drifted by, United never looking capable of getting the better of a team who remain in the bottom three. The draw leaves United in eighth place. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter about the system. It has to do with the characteristics of the players and we don\u2019t have many, with all the respect, mad dogs \u2013 the ones who bite the ball all the time and press all the time. We don\u2019t have many with that spirit,\u201d Mourinho said. Exempting Rashford from criticism, the manager suggested some of his players may not even be capable of showing such aggressiveness. \u201cIf they did not do better than they did, it\u2019s because they could not do it.\u201d He condemned his midfield by contrasting the qualities that United showed in the brief spell during which they scored their two goals with the rest of their play. \u201cIn that period the people with the ball made the right decisions,\u201d he said. \u201cThey played one-touch, two-touch football and made the ball arrive quick into the two attacking players ... fundamentally because we didn\u2019t lose the ball easily. We increased the tempo when we made the right decision and played simple.\u201d It was hard not to suspect the manager was referring to Paul Pogba, in particular, when he denounced the tendency of certain midfielders to dally on the ball, with the effect they either lost it or slowed United\u2019s progress. \u201cSomebody said many years ago that simplicity is genius. I agree totally with that old manager who had that brilliant phrase. In some areas of the pitch simplicity is genius. In the second half we wanted to win \u2013 the players showed that desire, I\u2019m not saying they didn\u2019t want it \u2013 but we needed better decisions. We needed to move the ball faster. \u201cSouthampton were playing for a point in the second half. But even the little chances they created was because we lost the ball. So we didn\u2019t have continuity in our attacking waves. We had one isolated and then for five, 10, 15 minutes we couldn\u2019t connect with the strikers. That continuity comes when you have fluid football, simple football in midfield.\u201d When it was put to Mourinho that Lukaku looked out of sorts, despite scoring after 12 games without a goal, the manager replied: \u201cSo write that. Don\u2019t ask me.\u201d He also said the decision to substitute Rashford in the 77th minute, which was booed by travelling fans, was taken by the player. \u201cHe asked to come off; he was injured,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cOne kick here, one foul there, lots of running and movement and he was done.\u201d Southampton fans applauded their team\u2019s performance, which relieved the pressure on Mark Hughes. \u201cI\u2019ll deal with [the pressure]. It\u2019s not a problem. You can see by the manner of the performance that everybody is fully engaged,\u201d the Southampton manager said. \u201cThere are a lot of clubs in or around us that are maybe underachieving and the perception is we should be doing better. Is that realistic? I don\u2019t know because we were 17th last season. \u201cWe all feel we\u2019re playing better now but we can\u2019t change overnight to be a top-six club like we have been in the past.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
