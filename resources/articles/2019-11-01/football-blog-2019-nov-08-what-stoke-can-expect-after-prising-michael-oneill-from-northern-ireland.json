O\u2019Neill used to adopt self-deprecating humour when explaining how seeking out international players from the nether regions of the game had become normality. A trip to Blackpool v Peterborough in League One where the reason for attending, Jordan Thompson, went unused summed up a scenario whereby O\u2019Neill had created national heroes from the unlikeliest of backdrops. There was time for the 50-year-old to attend Celtic\u2019s League Cup demolition of Hibernian later the same day; none of the 36 players listed are eligible to play for Northern Ireland. O\u2019Neill\u2019s achievements with the national side barely need explaining. In what mirrors the situation now, as the 50-year-old steps into Stoke City, eyebrows were raised when he swapped a highly successful tenure at Shamrock Rovers for his country. The assumption was that O\u2019Neill could and should have instead claimed a club post in England. As the Northern Irish toiled \u2013 there was a friendly draw with Malta before competitive losses to Azerbaijan and Luxembourg \u2013 the manager\u2019s leap into international football appeared outright folly. By last year, O\u2019Neill \u2013 a Catholic \u2013 was switching on Christmas lights in Belfast\u2019s arch-protestant Shankill area (Mark Hateley, a Rangers hero of the past, will perform such duties this time). O\u2019Neill had written himself into cross-community folklore through the power of football \u2013 the Northern Irish qualified for their first major finals in three decades in 2016 and came so close to repeating the feat two years later. Those who scoff at supposedly soft progression forget that Northern Ireland topped their Euro 2016 qualifying section. They equalled Switzerland for 180 minutes of a World Cup play-off as decided by an outrageous penalty award. Stoke\u2019s attraction to O\u2019Neill is obvious. He maximises resources by creating an environment players relish. The Northern Ireland squad remained firmly behind their manager even when early results were bad. Call-offs remained at a premium, as did retirements. Part of this was material \u2013 O\u2019Neill insisted and got the very best of facilities for his squad, whereby they sensed and rose to the value of international football. Earlier, Northern Ireland had been run as a jolly whereby success felt both unlikely and irrelevant. Attention to detail for squad gatherings became wonderfully intense, whereby every aspect of opposition was bestowed on players and in various forms. O\u2019Neill didn\u2019t care about outsiders learning his selection \u2013 in order to give maximum preparation time, he would lay out plans at the earliest opportunity. Andy Cousins, a publicity-shy but outstanding Irish scout who performed dual roles for Manchester City and Northern Ireland, sourced potential call-ups and opposition detail where others couldn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t all coffee and cuddles. After Kyle Lafferty was sent off shortly after coming on as a substitute during a key tie with Portugal in 2013, the manager shamed the striker in front of his teammates, asking why they tolerated his unreliable ways. Lafferty heeded the message sufficiently to score seven times in the heralded 2016 campaign. When the same player delivered a late call-off for Nations League matches last year, O\u2019Neill broke with convention by applying a Fifa rule which prevented him playing in his club\u2019s next fixture. O\u2019Neill is engaging and funny, but crossing him isn\u2019t a wise move. Through being based in Edinburgh, O\u2019Neill has been such a regular at domestic matches in England that the rigours of the Championship won\u2019t surprise him. O\u2019Neill has an understanding of structures within football \u2013 he has been taking part in a Uefa sporting director\u2019s course \u2013 that match his tactical versatility. His contacts book and access to coaching insight is enviable. Although the commercial terms of his contract render this a safe bet in so many ways, he is due immense credit from stepping outside of his comfort zone and back towards day-to-day coaching. Others tried and failed to prise O\u2019Neill away from the Irish Football Association \u2013 precisely what makes Stoke different will be fascinating to learn. Perhaps, quite legitimately, O\u2019Neill feels he can restore identity to a club which has drifted but such dreamy ideology contrasts with his natural pragmatism. As if to prove everyone wins here, the IFA won\u2019t at all mind receipt of a hefty compensation payment for a manager they backed and watched flourish as an international setup was totally rejuvenated. That O\u2019Neill can remain in charge of Northern Ireland for the upcoming matches against the Netherlands and Germany \u2013 and possibly more \u2013 owes everything to the esteem this manager is held in. On a purely football level, there should be sadness that this endearing alliance is coming to an end. O\u2019Neill batted hard for his country, including when it came to retaining young players the Republic of Ireland might seek to prise away \u2013 a matter he felt strongly about. Such battles will soon be a distant memory. Should O\u2019Neill repeat international heroics on a domestic platform, as is clearly the plan, Stoke\u2019s trajectory will be worthy of close attention."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
