The New Zealand union acted after receiving an independent report into the circumstances leading up to its being stripped of its hosting rights last March, written by the country's former chief justice, Sir Thomas Eichelbaum. After the 56-page report was made public yesterday, Murray McCaw resigned as the union's chairman with David Rutherford quitting as chief executive and John Spicer standing down as deputy chairman. In addition, the entire board, with the exception of two recently elected members, will go up for re-election at the next two annual meetings. Rob Fisher has replaced McCaw, who was singled out for criticism in the report for making a personal attack on the International Rugby Board and Rugby World Cup Ltd chairman, Vernon Pugh, days after New Zealand was told Australia would exclusively stage next year's tournament. Fisher, who resigned as a Rugby World Cup director after the New Zealand union failed to persuade the IRB's council to reinstate it as sub-host, admitted mistakes were made. \"The report showed that we made some misjudgments which contributed to the loss of our sub-host status,\" he said. \"It is critical that we look to the future and rebuild an international leadership position for New Zealand rugby.\" The New Zealand union lost the right to stage two of the four World Cup pools, two quarter-finals and a semi-final after it refused to sign a host agreement. Eichelbaum's report also criticised the Australian Rugby Union and Rugby World Cup Ltd. McCaw attacked Pugh, calling him divisive, among a number of insults, a tactic Eichelbaum found baffling. \"His words were inexcusable,\" he wrote. \"They damaged the [union's] credibility and they were no way to continue to press the case for sub-hosting.\" Meanwhile, Harlequins yesterday signed the 25-year-old Argentinian prop Pablo Cardinalli, who toured New Zealand with the Pumas last year. \"Pablo is a rare breed in the modern game, a quality tight-head prop,\" said Quins' chief executive Mark Evans. \"He may be uncapped but you do not tour New Zealand with Argentina unless you are a dominant and a powerful scrummager.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
