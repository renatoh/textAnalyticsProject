Although Chelsea\u2019s manager said it can be difficult for young players to resist the temptation to socialise, he added they have a responsibility to stay within the football bubble. Abraham and Chilwell gave England a selection headache after breaking the government\u2019s \u201crule of six\u201d guidelines by attending a party with Borussia Dortmund\u2019s Jadon Sancho, and Lampard pointed out their behaviour could have led to graver consequences than having to isolate from teammates. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t cry too much because we\u2019re able to do a job we love in these difficult circumstances,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s different for me at 42 years of age. I am very happy to go home and spend time with my children and my wife. I quite like not mixing households at times. You can get some peace at home. \u201cBut when you\u2019re 20, 22, 23, their lives are different and that\u2019s why my words are not too harsh on Tammy and Ben. I know they\u2019re good, decent lads. They admitted they made a mistake in terms of going to the party. They were apologetic and we move on. \u201cHopefully the words I did say will mean it won\u2019t be happening again because it can certainly affect selection. I know that\u2019s not what they\u2019ll want either. As much as that, they need to consider what it could mean if you\u2019re breaking the rules \u2013 it could endanger other people around you \u2013 and not be selfish. That\u2019s more important than if they\u2019ll be isolated from a squad or two. We all have to take those responsibilities. It\u2019s much bigger than football.\u201d Abraham and Chilwell are available for Chelsea\u2019s home game against Southampton on Saturday, and Hakim Ziyech is in contention after a knee injury. Ziyech has not played since joining from Ajax and Lampard welcomed the winger building fitness by coming off the bench in Morocco\u2019s 3-1 win over Senegal. \u201cIf he was going to stay behind I was looking at getting him minutes in a game behind closed doors,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cBehind closed doors is difficult for us because of the bubble. The ideal result was that he played 30 minutes for his country.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
