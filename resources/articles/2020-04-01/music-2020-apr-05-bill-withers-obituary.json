He did not try to enter the music industry until after he had spent nine years in the US Navy, leaving the service in 1965 and moving to Los Angeles two years later. By the time he released his debut album, Just As I Am, in 1971 he was 33, an age at which many pop careers have already been and gone. But Withers made up for lost time. His album was packed with memorable songs, including Harlem and Grandma\u2019s Hands, and entered the US Top 40. Ain\u2019t No Sunshine, his first single, reached No 3 and became one of the landmark songs in his career, despite lasting a scant two minutes. Inspired by Blake Edwards\u2019 gruelling 1962 film about alcoholism, Days of Wine and Roses, it has become an enduring anthem of loneliness and heartbreak. His second album, Still Bill (1972), was another formidable collection (Rolling Stone called it \u201ca stone-soul masterpiece\u201d). It reached No 4 on the US album chart and gave Withers a No 2 hit with Use Me, as well as his sole chart-topping single, Lean on Me. This was an ode to the power of friendship conceived with the simplicity of a gospel classic, apparently the work of an artist in complete control of his music and his destiny. In October 1974 he performed in Zaire with James Brown, Etta James and BB King, in the run-up to the fabled Rumble in the Jungle world heavyweight fight between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman. However, what looked like incipient megastardom never came to fruition. After the demise of his original record label, Sussex, Withers was signed to Columbia, where he was never comfortable and felt nothing but contempt for what he considered to be the company\u2019s narrow-minded executives. Though he notched up two more definitive hit singles, the serene and mantra-like Lovely Day (1977) and the hook-up with the saxophonist Grover Washington Jr on Just the Two of Us (1981), his sales tailed off. However, it was to Withers\u2019 advantage that he had never considered music his sole purpose in life. \u201cThe business came to me in my 30s,\u201d he later reflected. \u201cI was socialised as a regular guy. I never felt like I owned it or it owned me.\u201d His naval experience had given him self-confidence as well as the skills required of an aircraft mechanic. Before he signed a recording deal he supported himself by working at a variety of aircraft factories in California, paying to make his own demo recordings at night. Emerging from the other end of his music career, he never looked back. He focused on building a property portfolio in partnership with his second wife, Marcia, whom he married in 1976, while raising their children, Todd and Kori. Marcia also supervised the running of his music publishing company \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m lucky I married a woman with an MBA,\u201d he pointed out. Born in Slab Fork, West Virginia, Bill was the youngest of six children of William Harrison Withers Sr, a coal miner, and his wife, Mattie. They divorced when Bill was three, and William Sr died when he was 13. Growing up in poverty, Withers heard whatever music happened to catch his attention. \u201cMostly country music,\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd there was music in church, and whatever they taught you at school. And then there was the old Frank Sinatra \u2013 Nat King Cole genre type music. So whatever I could stand to listen to, I listened to.\u201d He remembered singing a capella gospel music, \u201cbecause that\u2019s something we could do without owning any instruments.\u201dHe had been born with a severe stutter: \u201cPeople laughed right in my face when I was trying to say something.\u201d At 17 he joined the navy and a speech therapy course organised by one of his commanding officers helped him to overcome it. The training perhaps also helped to give his singing voice its strength and emotional authority. He had no involvement in music while in the navy, but back in the US he visited nightclubs \u2013 \u201cI was only trying to meet girls, I wasn\u2019t looking for any music\u201d \u2013 and saw artists such as Lou Rawls. It occurred to Withers that music might be something he could do. \u201cI probably had some kind of hidden poet buried in my soul somewhere,\u201d he reflected. \u201cSort of a casual interest turned into a pursuit.\u201d He took some of his demo recordings to Ray Jackson, a member of the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band, which led to them being heard by Clarence Avant, the head of the Sussex label. He liked what he heard, commenting that \u201cBill Withers is a genius storyteller.\u201d He recruited Booker T Jones, of Booker T &amp; the MGs, to produce an album, and with the aid of musicians including members of the MGs and Stephen Stills on lead guitar, Just As I Am was recorded. \u201cHis voice and guitar was all he had, and that was almost all that was necessary,\u201d said Jones. \u201cSo I just tried to be minimalistic.\u201d Despite the huge attention brought by his first two albums, Withers was not happy. He did not enjoy touring, and his marriage to the TV star Denise Nicholas in 1973 brought mostly conflict. They divorced after barely a year and his album +\u2019Justments (1974) was released in the aftermath. In 1975 Sussex went bankrupt, and Withers signed his ill-fated deal with Columbia. His final album for them, Watching You Watching Me, only reached 143 on the US chart. Withers launched a lawsuit to get out of his Columbia contract. He did not release any new recordings after 1985, but Lovely Day, which reached No 7 in the UK in 1977, hit No 4 when it was reissued in 1988. The tune has been sampled by numerous artists including Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince, R Kelly and Maroon 5. Withers won Grammy Awards for Ain\u2019t No Sunshine, Just The Two of Us and Lean on Me, and his songs have been used in major films including Looking for Mr Goodbar, Jerry Maguire, Jackie Brown, Notting Hill, The Bodyguard and American Beauty. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2005 and in 2006 received ASCAP\u2019s Rhythm and Soul Heritage award. In 2015 he was inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame by Stevie Wonder. In 2017 he was given an honorary degree from West Virginia University. In 2009 Withers was profiled in the documentary Still Bill, which depicted a satisfied man experiencing no regrets about walking away from the music business. \u201cWhen somebody asks \u2018what have you been doing?\u2019 the answer is \u2018living\u2019,\u201d he said in 2003. \u201cI have no bitterness. I just live and whatever happens, happens.\u201d He is survived by Marcia and their children. \u2022 Bill Withers (William Harrison Withers Jr) singer and songwriter, born 4 July 1938; died 30 March 2020"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
