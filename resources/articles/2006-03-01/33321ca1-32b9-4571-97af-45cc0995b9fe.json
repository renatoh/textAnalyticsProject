Mr Reid told the Commons the move followed a growth in the Iraqi security forces to around 235,000. He stressed, however, that it did not mark the handover to Iraqis of security responsibility at an operational level. \"We will stay as long as we are needed, and wanted, and until the job is done,\" he said. \"This is a significant reduction which is based largely on the ability of the Iraqis themselves to participate and defend themselves against terrorism. But there is a long, long way to go. \"I have been absolutely clear that we are not yet at the stage where whole provinces could be taken under the responsibility of Iraqi security forces. We continue to assess that. When those conditions are met, I will make another announcement to this House.\" Britain had 46,000 military personnel in Iraq during combat operations in March and April 2003. That figure dropped to 18,000 in May 2004, and to 8,500 at the end of last year. At the time of the last withdrawal of British troops, in October, Mr Reid said 190,000 members of the Iraqi security forces were trained and equipped. The total was now 235,000, and 5,000 more Iraqis were joining every month, he told MPs today. British troops, stationed mainly in the south of the country, would continue to have a presence in each of the four provinces for which they were responsible, Mr Reid said. But he added: \"Let me stress that the reductions I have announced are not part of a handover of security responsibility at the operational level.\" \"Our commitment to the Iraqi people and government remains total; our commitment to the coalition remains certain. It is important people understand that this is not the beginning of the handover or the start of that process.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
