As it turned out, that evening\u2019s sessions of the screwball hit were sold out, so we took a punt instead on the newly released Strictly Ballroom. By the time John Paul Young\u2019s Love Is in the Air played the film off, I was weeping hysterically \u2013 a response I still enjoy to this day \u2013 and convinced this was a new classic. As it turned out, I was correct: the film went on to be a box office smash, and is still perhaps the most successful crystallisation of Baz Luhrmann\u2019s particular vision (if only he\u2019d had just $3m a movie to play with for the rest of his career). My disappointment at not having been able to see Housesitter evaporated instantly over a fistful of rapidly melting compound chocolate and ice cream as soon as the Blue Danube fired up and Scott and Liz walked through those glass doors and into the Southern Districts Waratah Championships. And it was JPY\u2019s dreamy disco love ballad that stuck with me as one of the most romantic songs of all time. I guess these are the sorts of opinions you have at 10-and-a-half \u2013 especially one as eccentric as myself (I was already very interested in costume design, especially rhinestones, and eminently quotable films). But listening to the song today, I still agree with my fun-sized self. Young\u2019s hit, with its slightly daggy, not-quite-fast-enough disco beat, was the perfect fit for the film: in 1992 the world of competitive ballroom dancing was, in a pre-Dancing with the Stars world, not considered especially groovy. In a funny way, though, it\u2019s that specific quality that makes Love Is in the Air such an appealing song. Testament to the production nous of Harry Vanda and George Young (no relation), JPY had originally asked the songwriting gurus to pen him a potential hit for the German market after his single Standing in the Rain had become a runaway success there. Inspired by the \u201cclicks and electronic buzzes\u201d of Euro disco, even if the end result wasn\u2019t quite Giorgio Moroder, it remains one of Australia\u2019s enduring disco classics. In truth, there wasn\u2019t an awful lot of difference between the 1978 original and the 1992 redo that accompanied the film (the biggest was the loss, RIP, of his glorious Timotei mane): a new intro based on David Hirschfelder\u2019s score, a punched up version of the original arrangement, and a heavenly backing choir. But it was those subtle differences that took it from sweetly earnest disco slow jam and into the stratosphere \u2013 helped immeasurably by the very Luhrmann music video for the new version: I haven\u2019t seen the stage production of Strictly Ballroom that is now playing in Melbourne, and I\u2019m not sure that I will \u2013 how could it ever hope to recapture the alchemy that led to its cinematic predecessor\u2019s success? There\u2019s an innocence (though some would probably say an infantile quality) to Love Is in the Air\u2019s lyrics, what with its vague and wistful references to \u201cthe whisper of the trees\u201d and \u201cthe thunder of the sea\u201d. Perhaps that\u2019s why it struck such a chord with preteen me, whose idea of romance was only just beginning to take shape. Either way, to this day, whenever Valentine\u2019s Day rolls around I take a break from cynicism by putting John Paul Young on the stereo and weeping freely while thinking of Scott and Fran\u2019s triumph at the Pan-Pacific Grand Prix."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
