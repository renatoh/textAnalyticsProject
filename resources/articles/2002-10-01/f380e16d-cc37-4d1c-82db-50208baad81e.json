Forget the saucy revelations of Edwina Currie - when it comes to making money from the delicate art of kiss-and-tell, Ulrika Jonsson, television presenter and former flame of England football manager Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson, is set to become queen of the autobiography. Associated Newspapers, proprietor of the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday, is to pay Jonsson, a former weather girl whose turbulent love life has often found its way on to the front pages, around \u00a3700,000 for the serialisation rights to her memoirs. The massive payout is thought to be a record for a British newspaper group and will follow Associated's recent serialisation of Tony Benn's autobiography and Jeffrey Archer's prison diaries, due to be published this week. The Sunday Times is thought to have paid more than \u00a31 million for Margaret Thatcher's memoirs, but the Jonsson deal is unprecedented in celebrity publishing circles. The huge sum has shocked Fleet Street and will raise questions of what further revelations Jonsson has in store. 'It's an astronomical amount to pay and it means it's going to have to be explosive. In this economic climate, when the value of serialisation rights is tumbling, it's extraordinary,' said one publishing source last night. Associated may have opted to pay the huge sum in a bid to see off arch rival Richard Desmond of Express Newspapers. Jonsson's agent negotiated the sale of the serialisation rights, rather than Macmillan, the book's publisher, and she is known to have turned down a \u00a3500,000 offer from Desmond. Jonathan Lloyd, managing director of Curtis Brown, said: 'There are two reasons Associated might have been interested. Either they wanted it. Or they didn't want someone else to have it.' Despite the huge sums involved, the value of the Associated deal with Jonsson is not thought to have been inflated on the Fleet Street grapevine. 'Ulrika is an example of one of those people who do sell books and newspapers. She's had her ups and downs but she's come up smiling. Good luck to her,' Lloyd said. Jonsson, whose well-known lovers include cameraman John Turnbull, German hotelier Markus Kempen, footballer Stan Collymore, Gladiator Hunter, and showbiz lawyer Edward Paladorio, is expected to open her heart over her affair with Eriksson, which was exposed shortly before the World Cup and became a national obsession. Fleet Street had a field day comparing the Scandinavian looks and personality of Jonsson with the fiery persona of Sven's girlfriend, the Italian lawyer Nancy Dell'Olio. There has also been speculation that Jonsson will reveal affairs with several other celebrities. The serialisation of the book is due to start on 19 October."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
