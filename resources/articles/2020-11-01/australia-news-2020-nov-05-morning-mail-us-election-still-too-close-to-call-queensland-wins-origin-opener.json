Top stories Joe Biden\u2019s camp has announced that the Democratic candidate is \u201con a clear path to victory this afternoon\u201d to become the 46th president of the United States. Counting continues in several key battleground states, after the elections commissioner of Wisconsin called the state for Biden, prompting Donald Trump\u2019s campaign manager to demand an immediate recount. Having falsely claimed victory last night, the president has repeatedly alleged electoral \u201cfraud\u201d, claims tech giants Facebook and Twitter have labelled as \u201cmisleading\u201d. Biden is ahead in Nevada and Michigan, with Trump leading in Georgia, North Carolina, Alaska and Pennsylvania, but both candidates retain potential paths to victory. Counting in the Senate and House contests continue, with the Republicans retaining a strong possibility of controlling the upper chamber. Analysts have cautioned that the result of the US elections may not be known for days, weeks \u2013 even months. With more than two-thirds of voters casting early or postal ballots dues to Covid-19, vote-counting in some states has slowed down dramatically. Joe Biden has won more votes than any candidate in history \u2013 surpassing Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 tally, as the former vice-president approaches 70m votes, but a definitive result is not expected until at least Friday. Legal challenges \u2013 such as those already launched in Pennsylvania \u2013 could further protract the official declaration of a winner, with the supreme court potentially intervening should serious irregularities in vote counting emerge, as it did in 2000. Renewable energy now accounts for more than a quarter of Australia\u2019s electricity generation, according to a new analysis of Australia\u2019s national energy market. Black coal\u2019s contribution has dropped below 50% for four consecutive months for the first time, with the impact of new renewables coming on to the grid more significant for gas emission reductions than the impact of Covid-19. \u201cRenewables in Australia are now cheaper and more popular than fossil fuels, and we expect a lot more renewables coming online soon,\u201d the analyst Richie Merzian told Guardian Australia. Australia Seven in ten young Australians consider the \u201cAustralian dream\u201d of retiring by 65 and owning their own home now unattainable, with the coronavirus pandemic driving increasing pessimism about financial security and major life goals. The Coalition\u2019s proposed federal integrity commission won\u2019t prevent corruption, transparency campaigners have warned, with current drafts proposing that inquiries take place behind closed doors, prompting one leading barrister to call the model \u201ca sham\u201d. Australian not-for-profit organisations are suffering \u201ca huge financial blow\u201d, with Covid-19 greatly exacerbating a trend that has seen 40% of surveyed charities post losses over the past three years. The world The arrest of a prominent rightwing television anchor has sparked protests in India, with the Maharashtra state government accused of a \u201cblatant misuse of state power\u201d in locking up the passionate supporter of the prime minister, Narendra Modi. France is contemplating appointing a special envoy to better communicate Emmanuel Macron\u2019s championing of secularism, amid a wave of anti-French backlashes within the Muslim world. Ethiopia stands on the brink of civil conflict after the country\u2019s prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, reportedly ordered a military response to an \u201cattack\u201d by regional rulers in the northern Tigray region. Denmark has announced a cull of 15 million mink over fears the animals could help allow a Covid-19 mutation to spread, jeopardising the effectiveness of any future vaccines. Denmark is the world\u2019s largest producer of mink fur. Recommended reads Donald Trump, America\u2019s howling id, has not lost this election. Then again, Joe Biden has not won it, writes Marina Hyde. \u201cShould Biden edge a victory, thanks to the way the self-styled greatest democracy in the world works, we will have months of grimly incendiary Trump claims that it was stolen. Or, to put it in terms the rest of the planet would understand: this is like winning the World Cup in November, then having the losing captain use it as a toilet for three months before finally handing the brimming trophy over to you in late January.\u201d The women\u2019s liberation movement is rarely credited as a punk movement, writes Kath Kenny. But a striking new film, Brazen Hussies, from the first-time director Catherine Dwyer, goes a long way to addressing that oversight. \u201cWomen\u2019s liberationists squatted in vacant Anglican church houses to establish a women\u2019s refuge; they graffitied slogans (\u201cLesbians are lovely\u201d) and threw bras on statues at Parliament House\u201d, blending music, poetry and art into their activism \u2013 as captured by Dwyer\u2019s \u201cterrific archival footage and photos\u201d from 1965-75. The official Australian cash rate is at a 45-year low, so if you\u2019ve ever wanted to demand a better mortgage \u2013 now is the moment, says Greg Jericho. \u201cWhen John Howard bragged about \u2018record low\u2019 rates back in 2002, the cash rate was 4.25%. I doubt we will ever see rates that high again.\u201d And with long, sustained economic booms unlikely any time soon, near-zero cash rates could be here for at least the next three years, according to the Reserve Bank\u2019s new projections.
