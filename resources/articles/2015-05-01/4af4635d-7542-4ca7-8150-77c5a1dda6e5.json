Asif Malik, 31, his partner, Sara Kiran, 29, and their four children \u2013 all aged under eight \u2013 were arrested in Ankara last month after British police launched an appeal to track their whereabouts. A Foreign Office spokesman said: \u201cWe can confirm the detention of a British family in Moldova. We are working closely with UK and Moldavian authorities to help ensure their wellbeing. We will not comment further on cases involving minors.\u201d An unnamed Turkish official had previously said that the family would be deported to Moldova \u201cof their own will\u201d. The Foreign Office said the family had sought consular assistance during their detainment in Turkey, but was unable to give any further details. \u201cWhether we\u2019re involved in the case in the future depends on the family. If they approach us as British nationals in distress then we will be available to provide consular assistance if they require that.\u201d Police launched an appeal to trace the Malik family last month, after it was discovered they had left their home in Slough, Berkshire, without informing their family and friends or mentioning any holiday or travel plans. Officers established that the couple, their daughter, Zoha, seven, and sons Essa, four, Zakariya, two and one-year-old Yhaha boarded a ferry from Dover to Calais on 8 April. The family were reported missing on 16 April and Kiran\u2019s relatives made an emotional appeal for her to get in touch, saying: \u201cWe miss you.\u201d Turkish officials said the family crossed into Turkey by land from Greece via the town of Kirklareli on 16 April and were detained on 20 April after a tipoff from British police. John Campbell, the acting deputy chief constable of Thames Valley police, said: \u201cGiven the online rhetoric from the Islamic State encouraging people to travel to Syria, the direction of travel and concerns voiced by Asif\u2019s family, Thames Valley police is concerned the family may be seeking to travel to Syria.\u201d Campbell said police were not drawing any conclusions about the family\u2019s intentions. \u201cI\u2019m not suggesting for one moment that they are intending to join Islamic State. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything to suggest that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that having gone into Europe, their general direction of travel is towards Turkey, thereby we make the assumption towards Syria. At the same time, we know that the [wider] family have voiced some concerns about the family\u2019s intentions. There\u2019s been a suggestion that Mr Asif in the past has said that he would like to live in a Muslim state.\u201d Anjem Choudary, the former leader of the banned radical group al-Muhajiroun, described Malik as a \u201cchampion for sharia\u201d (Islamic law) who regularly attended al-Muhajiroun events and demonstrations. In a statement issued through police, Malik\u2019s family said: \u201cWith the reality that our loved one, Asif Malik, and his family have left the UK without any notice, our lives have been completely devastated. \u201cWe are totally distraught, upset and in shock. The greatest sadness is the decision by Asif and Sara to travel with their young family, such beautiful children. \u201cPlease, Asif, we ask you to think about what has happened and the decisions you have made. Please can you ring us or send us a message to let us know that you and the children are well. All we wish for is your safe return and especially the return of the children. We are not angry with you, we are just heartbroken. \u201cWe ask that if there are others out there considering leaving the UK in this manner, please consider the impact on the family members that you leave behind.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
