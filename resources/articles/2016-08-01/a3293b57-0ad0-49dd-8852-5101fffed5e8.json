Sonia Hamilton, vice-chairwoman of the parish council, gestures at the listed building, known as the Manor House. \u201cThe state of that and the pub was depressing,\u201d she says. On this blustery August day, however, there are signs of change. Workers in hard hats mill around, hoardings are about to go up around the Manor House and the dilapidated pub is sheathed in tarpaulin. Last week planning permission was granted to convert the Manor House into a 19-room hotel, while restoration of the Farmers Arms pub to something approaching its former glory is due to be completed by the end of next year. For unlike other villages across the country facing the plight of dwindling shops and services, coupled with declining populations and rising house prices, Woolsery (also known as Woolfardisworthy) is the unlikely beneficiary of the largesse, coupled with some business savvy, of Michael Birch, a laidback tech entrepreneur who lives in San Francisco. Birch, who with his wife Xochi founded and then sold the social networking site Bebo, was born in Cambridgeshire but spent much of his childhood visiting relations in Woolsery, and there are members of six generations of his family buried in the churchyard. He was alerted to the village\u2019s plight by his sister, Hilary, and decided to spend some of the \u00a3300m nest egg generated by the sale of Bebo on preserving the village. \u201cWhat he\u2019s doing is madness, of course, but he knows his pubs,\u201d said Hamilton, who set up an action group with her husband to save the pub. Birch has professed to having fond childhood memories of the Farmers Arms, and bought the interior of an English pub and transplanted it to a club he set up in San Francisco. The irony of someone who made his fortune by creating a virtual social space choosing to invest that money in a physical social space goes unremarked. \u201cHe\u2019s been good to his word, and everything he\u2019s said he would do he\u2019s come through and done it,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s spent a heck of a lot of money on it. He could become the local squire, I suppose, but it comes down to his personality and that\u2019s not really him. He\u2019s not coming here to lord it over us.\u201d Birch also bought the fish and chip shop next to the pub, where manager Jay Oyarzabal enthused about working for him. \u201cThis is the spearhead of the operation,\u201d said Oyarzabal, standing behind the counter before a blackboard offering fresh fish from nearby Ilfracombe and pulled pork hotdogs. \u201cIt\u2019s not like working for a company,\u201d said Oyarzabal. \u201cIt\u2019s like family. I don\u2019t have to turn a profit here. That\u2019s not Michael\u2019s thing. We break even. What he cares about is having it for the village. \u201cIt\u2019s been blown up with people saying he\u2019s the saviour of the broken village. The village is lovely as it is, but we\u2019re incredibly lucky. I don\u2019t think that anyone but a multimillionaire could do what he\u2019s doing. Next door, in the village shop, owner Andy Fryatt said that he had already seen the benefits of Birch\u2019s activities. \u201cThe guys working on the site come in here to get bits and pieces, then the new businesses in the village will create jobs, there will be an impact on house prices, the whole package. There have been several remarks about dying villages that have put people\u2019s backs up. In the centre of the village this shop was last man standing. We\u2019ve been keeping the heart of the village beating. Now there\u2019s going to be someone else.\u201d He is another unusual figure in the village\u2019s atypical story. While 200-300 village shops close every year, Fryatt, despite not having a background in retail, runs a thriving business. \u201cVillage retail has been in long-term decline for more than 20 years,\u201d said Kenneth Parsons, chief executive of the Rural Shops Alliance. \u201cIn the past you could be an amateur but now customers don\u2019t take prisoners; they expect high standards, supermarket-style standards.\u201d Others point to transport and housing as causes of the decline of many villages, and even Hamilton admitted that one potential downside to Birch\u2019s investment could be an increase in house prices. \u201cIt is great to see someone so clearly attached to the village aiming to give it a new lease of life, and restoring places at the centre of the community,\u201d said Shaun Spiers, chief executive of the Campaign to Protect Rural England. Referring to research showing that only one in 10 rural houses were affordable to the local population, he said: \u201cThis of course has a knock-on effect. Many local people are unable to afford to stay and patronise the pub or shop, or send their children to the local school. Too many villages are being sealed off. Villages should be beautiful, but they must be vibrant communities full of life too.\u201d Hamilton, standing next to what will become a much-needed village green linking the school to the church, pondered the fate of Woolsery. \u201cIs it a village in decline? As a community I don\u2019t think it is, but the pub is a real centre. At the moment we\u2019re spread to the four corners. It\u2019s nice seeing it coming back to life.\u201d Her thoughts are given an academic sheen by a study into the contribution of local pubs to rural communities published at the end of 2014 by Northumbria University in Newcastle. \u201cThe English rural pub is not simply a place for drink, it has become a hub for the community\u2019s infrastructure offering events, support and friendship,\u201d the report found. \u201cPubs function as physical hubs which foster engagement and involvement among the community, as well as creating jobs for locals and local suppliers.\u201d Carol Bonnefin, who has lived in Woolsery for more than 30 years, was more straightforward. \u201cWhat we need is a pub, and we need it now,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Farmers Arms was somewhere you could go and have a pint. Tuesday evening was bell-ringing. You could do that and then go in the pub. It was the centre of the village. They used to hold parish council meetings upstairs, and the assizes.\u201d Hilary Birch, the entrepreneur\u2019s sister, agreed that the value of the pub and the hotel were greater than mere bricks and mortar. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly important to have these community buildings in a village,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s where people get a sense of community and of belonging.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 23 August 2016 to add the other name of the village, Woolfardisworthy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
