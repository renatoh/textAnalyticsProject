Johnson, who is on Leicester's shortlist to take over from Dean Richards as head coach along with Ireland's Declan Kidney and the former Australia centre Pat Howard, returned to Australia this week after his mother was taken ill. The Australia coach Eddie Jones wants Johnson to become his assistant, but Ruddock believes Johnson will sign a new contract with the Welsh Rugby Union. \"Andrew Hore is staying on as conditioning coach and Clive Griffiths is close to agreeing a contract to become defence coach,\" said Ruddock, who officially takes over from Steve Hansen next month. \"I'm just waiting on Scott Johnson and he should be heading back to us next week when the management team will be made public.\" Gloucester have been given until next week to resolve their dispute with Twickenham after the club's decision to withdraw the centre Henry Paul from England's Hong Kong Sevens squad last week. The Rugby Football Union's management board yesterday deferred for a week the setting up of a disciplinary panel to consider the case against Gloucester, who could be docked league points. If Gloucester, whose captain Jake Boer yesterday signed a three-year contract, provide two players to the \"wider\" England Sevens squad for the rest of this season and the next, as the other 11 Premiership clubs have, they will not be punished for playing Paul against Sale next week after being told to stand him down. It is understood that the RFU wants Paul, or a player of comparable ability and experience, to be one of the two players named. Gloucester said last night that they were considering their response, but the RFU is clearly looking for a diplomatic solution in what could be interpreted as a tacit admission that the club's stance - that the correct protocol had not been observed over the selection of Paul - was not entirely without merit. Worcester, who will clinch the first division title if they defeat Bristol at home on Saturday, will know next month if their facilities merit promotion. The club passed the preliminary audit and next week's final inspection is expected to be a formality. The decision on whether Worcester take the place of their arch-rivals Rotherham in the Premiership will be made by England Rugby Ltd, a body which divided on club and RFU lines last year when Rotherham's case was considered. ERL will also consider next month whether to continue with the system of automatic promotion and relegation. The England outside-half Olly Barkley will remain at Bath for the next two years after signing a new contract yesterday. The Northampton centre Matt Tucker is unlikely to play again this season after fracturing his left hand last weekend."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
