Now marketing experts are trying to convince us to fold weddings and honeymoons into each other (preferably on some tropical beach) in a series of sun-soaked Kodak moments that everyone will treasure for the rest of their lives. Caribbean resorts even have whole packages set up for the sickly notion of familymoons, where the kids come too. But what is the reality? A teenage girl in torture at the thought of having to strip down to a bikini next to her more attractive step-sibling or a pouting page boy counting his mosquito bites? And then there is the risk of a bankrupted bride and groom because such shenanigans don't come in under \u00a36,000. Unless, of course, the newlyweds want to share a room with their offspring.
