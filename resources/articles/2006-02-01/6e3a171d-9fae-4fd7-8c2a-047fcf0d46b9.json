Probably not much. Daughter and I are still clinging to my mother's old nighties and sticks of furniture, my first baby shoes, Daughter's first Babygro, school reports and guinea-pig drawings. But this house-clearing is lightweight compared to brain-clearing. I find that my mind is clogged and seething with grudges, hatreds and regrets. So is Rosemary's. We are waiting for resolutions, explanations and apologies from infuriating ex-partners, relatives or chums, that will never come. We go through the words, of what we didn't say, or should have said, or said but it made no difference, so we rehearse what we'll say when we get the chance, if we get it, and whether we want it anyway, because they never listen. Round and round goes the mind, slogging through arguments and reconciliations, for hours and hours, especially in the dead of night. Rosemary is still hoping for a conciliatory Christmas card from a two-timing cad from her past/a grovelling apology from a ruthless and grasping relative/signs of regret from a fraudulent ex-friend. She waits in vain. The mind seems to have a mind of its own. There I am, getting on with my improved new life, when out of the blue, a memory bubbles up and I'm going over and over the old relationship in all its ghastliness, wondering why ever I stuck it for so long. What a waste of time it was and here I am, wasting more time, thinking about what a waste of time it all was. Fielding's mind is also churning away, remembering his wicked ex-boss and pumping up his blood-pressure. \"Why didn't I call him a lying, scheming, criminal Headmaster? How do villains get away with it?\" asks Fielding's mind, and demands retribution: Headmaster clamped into the stocks, or perhaps hanging from a meat hook in Trafalgar Square. Being a mild fellow in real life, Fielding is rather shocked by his own vicious fantasies. We must let it all go, says Fielding's doctor and other clever-dick advisers. But how? Apparently it goes when the next one - romance, job, feud - takes over. Unless you're too old for a next one, or don't even want one. I may as well stick to the house clearing. Only 24 years of dreck instead of 63."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
