I am Hillary Rodham Clinton, and this is the Graham Norton Show.\u201d The almost-holder of what was once the loftiest imaginable office was surprisingly game for a bit of British kitsch: warm, indulgent and dressed in yellow, like a president on a kindergarten walkabout. She is still too grand for some of Graham Norton\u2019s antics. She wasn\u2019t sold on the idea of sharing a sofa with another celebrity. You cannot blame her. The chat-trading of Norton\u2019s ersatz dinner party environment is inherently high-risk. You could be in the middle of the most profoundly revealing story \u2013 one you could have saved for a love affair, or your Vanity Fair profile \u2013 and be eclipsed by someone\u2019s anecdote about finding a caterpillar in their cheese sandwich. So it was just her in the beam of Norton\u2019s irresistible curiosity. And while she has a book to promote \u2013 What Happened \u2013 there was still this pressing incongruity of her normality. She arrived on stage wearing a surgical boot which she explained in an anecdote neither interesting nor uninteresting, just ambiently pleasant to listen to, like cicadas. \u201cI was running down the stairs in heels with a cup of coffee in hand,\u201d \u2013 a break for a short homily on how unwise it was to run with coffee \u2013 \u201cI was talking over my shoulder and my heel caught and I fell backwards\u201d. She broke her toe. She had excellent medical care from our \u201cEnglish medical system\u201d (little shout out for the NHS, thoughtful and serendipitous). Well. You sound perfectly \u2026 nice. How come nobody ever mentions that you\u2019re perfectly nice? Graham Norton\u2019s line of questioning was pretty bold: did she feel jinxed? You know, all geared up in 2008, then Obama came along (\u201cwell he was an excellent president\u201d). Then in 2016 Bernie Sanders came along (though he didn\u2019t actually win; so if Norton\u2019s hypothesis was correct and the universe was working against her, it was pretty part-time work). Then Trump, of course. She didn\u2019t take this head on (is there an answer, to \u201care you jinxed?\u201d). But about her feelings, upon losing, she was perfectly plain: she felt terrible. She felt responsible. \u201cIt was such a surprise: it was so shocking and obviously devastating.\u201d There remains a slight disconnect between the words and the calm, sunny delivery but it\u2019s not dissembling so much as a generalised disconnect. You can\u2019t stay shocked forever. A former president can give a view on almost anything, past dignities conferring importance upon their every thought. A former nearly-president has to choose their topic. Al Gore had the environment. Hillary\u2019s cause is that Donald Trump is bad. Like climate change, it is unarguable but it still needs saying \u2013 and she will not rest until she\u2019s said it a lot of times. Describing the inauguration, she insisted: \u201cI wanted him to rise to the occasion and be our president. That didn\u2019t happen. We were listening to this really dark, divisive speech \u2026 a cry from the white nationalist gut. I am was so disappointed, so sad.\u201d The best line, she gives to George W Bush, who reputedly turned around and said: \u201cThat was some weird shit.\u201d Seriously, run through this one more time. How did a nation choose \u2013 over her \u2013 the guy who could only debate her with grim-faced, pantomime prowling? \u201cWatch it with the sound off,\u201d she counselled of the TV debates. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to what he was saying: much of it was untrue and just silly. But watch it with the sound down and you\u2019d think: \u2018Boy, he\u2019s out there, really giving it to her.\u2019 Maybe I should have turned around and said: \u2018You\u2019re not going to intimidate me like you try to intimidate women. Back off you creep!\u2019\u201d Regret hung in the air: the impossibility of fully regretting a disaster that you still don\u2019t know the extent of. I wonder if even Graham Norton\u2019s trademark ebullience survived once the lights went down."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
