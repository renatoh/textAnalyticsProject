The Polish-Jewish composer spent most of his life in Paris, though his Fifth and Sixth Symphonies date from his wartime exile in the US. Essentially a neoclassicist, Tansman has been castigated for his over-reliance on Stravinsky as a model. The Fourth Symphony (1939), however, also reveals debts to Ravel and early Prokofiev, who was similarly active in Paris in the interwar years. Tansman could be variable, since his Fifth (1942), hugely popular in his lifetime, now comes over as episodic. The Sixth (1944), however, is a major achievement: deploying a string quartet and a chorus in addition to the standard orchestra, it alternately mourns and rages at the Nazi invasion of France in music of bleak power. The performances, with Oleg Caetani conducting the Melbourne Chorale and Symphony Orchestra, are faultless."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
