The student was pronounced dead minutes later, and the pedestrian left in critical condition. As crowds milled through the city center around 6pm that evening, Rebecca Kim, a pre-pharmacy student at Temple University, probably slipped to her death after leaning over a narrow ledge, police inspector Scott Small told reporters later that night. Temple University identified Kim on Friday as the victim in a statement that offered condolences to her family and friends, and said counseling services would be available for students. The unidentified passerby remains in \u201ccritical, but stable\u201d condition after fracturing a vertebra and losing several teeth. \u201cYou\u2019d never think that someone would fall on you while you\u2019re trying to walk down the street,\u201d another pedestrian nearby told CBS3 local news. A police representative told the Guardian that Kim\u2019s death remains under investigation, and that the two students Kim had been visiting at the Art Institute of Philadelphia had spoken with police. Small said on Thursday that Kim\u2019s death could not yet be declared an accident, although at that point police had no evidence to suggest suicide or deliberate wrongdoing. Kim grew up in Edison, New Jersey, and then the tightly knit community of Korean Americans who live in the suburbs north-west of Philadelphia. Louis Lee, who accompanied Kim to her senior prom at Wissahickon high school, wrote a tribute to his lost friend on Facebook. \u201cI woke up today to the news about what happened,\u201d Lee begins. \u201cIt just seems like yesterday when we first met at community service.\u201d \u201cI always wanted to visit Temple in my free time to visit you,\u201d he writes, \u201cand now I\u2019m gonna regret that for the rest of my life. I could\u2019ve seen you one last time, maybe even sing for you like I promised during prom. RIP Becca, I will truly miss you, I love you with all my heart.\u201d Kim graduated from Wissahickon with good grades, a spot in the National Honor Society and a transcript that included science competitions, the photography club and track meets. Heidi Butt, Kim\u2019s track coach and science teacher, said the you woman was \u201cthe sweetest person, softspoken but with a great sense of humor, a person who would never think ill of anyone\u201d. Butt said that Kim had gone to regional and state science competitions with her work, and shown rare love for process rather than results. \u201cShe was never the best on the track team, but she was always concerned with improving her time, with the process of it, of learning and improving for the joy of it.\u201d \u201cShe was just a humble, kind, intelligent girl,\u201d Butt said. Kim regularly attended Presbyterian services with her Korean-American family and arrived at Temple with a quiet vivaciousness on display in a video she posted online, during the early days of her first semester in college. \u201cI like nicknames, so Becca, Becky, Becks, Beckster, whatever works,\u201d is Kim\u2019s introduction to her Temple peers, and affability and enthusiasm quickly shine through her protestations of being \u201ca pretty typical student\u201d and a habit of self-deprecation: \u201cI don\u2019t know how to swim. I don\u2019t understand how people just float on water \u2013 I could never do that.\u201d By listing almost at random the small details of her life, Kim hints at the person that her former teacher and coach describes: she liked \u201csmall social gatherings\u201d, is \u201callergic to apples but I eat them anyway,\u201d and recommends her favorite book, a work of pop science about introversion, while admitting \u201cI\u2019m a little biased.\u201d The theme of Kim\u2019s video, apt for a first semester of college, is goals, and she at first rattles off items that are familiar to anyone who\u2019s experienced late adolescence: good grades, making friends, working on \u201csocial skills because I can be pretty introverted and awkward\u201d. But about her larger goals in life she worried slightly, as every sensible 18-year-old does. \u201cI feel like I never had any other huge, unique or interesting goals,\u201d she says, \u201cThe future was too scary to think about. Instead I\u2019d only dream.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not a patient person, so setting long-term goals is not my thing,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t think too hard about what would happen before and during pharmacy school. Whatever happens happens.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
