It is a case of one hardline Serb nationalist turning on another. Mrs Plavsic, 71, the most senior Serb politician and the only woman brought before the Hague tribunal, is reported to have told the UN's chief prosecutor, Carla del Ponte, that she is ready to testify that Milosevic is guilty as charged of crimes against humanity in Kosovo, Croatia and Bosnia. The news is a real coup for Mrs Del Ponte, who desperately needs witnesses from the former ruling group in Belgrade who know how decisions were made there. But there is also speculation that Mrs Del Ponte has done a deal to secure Mrs Plavsic's cooperation. In August she released Mrs Plavsic from the UN remand centre in the Hague so that she could live in Serbia until her trial next year. Although not without precedent, the decision was unusual. Mrs Plavsic's lawyers argued that the tribunal's detention centre in Scheveningen was built solely to hold male prisoners and was unsuitable for Mrs Plavsic. Mrs Del Ponte denies that there was a bargain.\"No deal. No deal. It's not my way of working,\" she told reporters recently. Ay deal would look bad, because Mrs Plavsic is charged with several very serious offences. She took over from Radovan Karadzic as Bosnian Serb president in 1996 and stands accused of masterminding the ethnic cleansing of thousands of Bosnian Muslims and Croats in the years before and during the 1992-95 Bosnian war. Trying to distance himself from her activities, Mr Milosevic has criticised her for being too zealous in her clearance drive against non-Serbs. She belonged, he once said, in a mental hospital. His wife, Mirjana Markovic, once called her \"a female Mengele\": a reference to the Nazi doctor who carried out medical experiments on live victims. Mrs Del Ponte has disclosed that Mr Milosevic's trial, when it eventually begins, is likely to last up to two years and that a third set charges relating to war crimes allegedly perpe trated in Bosnia will be ready within weeks. Mr Milosevic is due to appear before the tribunal for the third time on October 29, when he will have the opportunity to enter a plea for a recent set of charges lodged against him relating to war crimes committed in Croatia in 1991-92. But it is expected that he will refuse to do so, since he believes the tribunal has no legitimacy. In a related development, the trial began in Belgrade yesterday of Radomir Markovic, Mr Milosevic's former chief of state security and three aides, who are accused of trying to kill the opposition leader Vuk Draskovic in 1999 by staging a car crash. Mr Draskovic was injured but survived."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
