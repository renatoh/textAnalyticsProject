Christensen on Friday joined his fellow federal MP Bob Katter in support of Patton Eidson, 73, a popular north Queensland resort owner who was taken into detention after a raid on his home by 15 border force officials on Wednesday. Eidson\u2019s looming deportation to the US, where authorities issued a warrant for his arrest in 1989 over an alleged conspiracy to import cannabis but have since declined to apply for his extradition, is the latest step in an extraordinary saga. Eidson, his late wife, Sonja, and daughter, Maya, then 16, arrived on false passports in 1986 and made a new life in Julatten in north Queensland as owners of a \u201cwellness\u201d resort. Their true identities were revealed in 2011 and each was convicted of migration and identity fraud. But the family, who say the drug allegations in the US are false, retain overwhelming support in their local communities and the backing of their federal MPs to stay. In regard to the family\u2019s entry to Australia, Christensen said it was \u201cquite obvious that Patton Eidson has broken the rules and there are consequences for breaking the rules\u201d. \u201cHowever, he is an old man and I am not sure about the benefits of this outcome [detention and deportation],\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cRegardless of my views on Patton, I am not really in a position to stop the process.\u201d Eidson\u2019s conviction and sentence of two years jail made cancellation of his visa mandatory under the Migration Act, he said. Katter said the unexpected detainment of Eidson, \u201cthis poor 73-year-old bloke who\u2019s just lost his wife and was responsible for some alleged misdemeanour nearly half a century ago\u201d was \u201cjust sickening\u201d. \u201cThe horrible insensitivity of what has occurred here is appalling and we will be saying so in formal questions with notice to the two ministers involved,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re using government resources to terrorise a well-loved, popular, respectable citizen, you\u2019d say it\u2019s a waste of resources.\u201d Christensen said he was \u201cstrenuously opposed\u201d to any move to deport Maya \u201cgiven that she was a child when her family entered Australia using false identities\u201d. She is a constituent of Christensen\u2019s, living and running a popular restaurant in his hometown of Mackay with her daughter. Maya, who became an Australian citizen under her assumed name of Sharon Gregory, sponsored her father for an aged parent visa on his release after serving six months in jail. But last April, the immigration minister, Peter Dutton, revoked her citizenship over her \u201cconvictions for citizenship and migration related fraud\u201d, a spokeswoman from the Department of Immigration and Border Protection said. At the same time, Dutton decided that Eidson, with his outstanding warrants in the US and his sentence of more than 12 months, \u201cfailed to meet character requirements under section 501 of the Migration Act\u201d, the spokeswoman said. The Eidsons arrived in Australia in 1986 as Mike and Anita McGoldrick, using false passports using birth certificates supplied by a terminally ill friend. They fled California following Eidson\u2019s arrest along with some associates who were charged with conspiracy to smuggle cannabis from Thailand. Eidson had been questioned and released without charge, which had raised suspicions among members of the drug ring he had turned witness, Maya said. Despite no charges, Eidson and Sonja were hit with $2m bills by US tax authorities for supposed drug profits, under laws since repealed. Panicked by the debt and an anonymous warning he should \u201cdisappear\u201d, Eidson, who was \u201ctrying to keep his family safe and together\u201d, did just that, Maya said. \u201cHe was in the wrong place at the wrong time,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. \u201cI was kept fairly sheltered from this at the time \u2013 all I know was they were very scared. I guess he maybe acted hastily or maybe didn\u2019t think things all the way through properly when he made certain decisions but it was due to fear and trying to keep his family safe.\u201d The couple in 1991 bought what would become north Queensland\u2019s first \u201cwellness retreat\u201d, employing more than 40 people and establishing community ties. The death of their late friend\u2019s widow, the real Anita McGoldrick, in 2009 eventually led US authorities to discover the misuse of her identity. A tip-off to Australia resulted in the Eidsons being arrested on migration and identity fraud charges in 2011. A prosecutor told the district court in Cairns in 2012, the family had \u201cnot only \u2026 led a blameless existence but they have been helpful to the economy of the local community of Julatten and are well-loved and respected there\u201d. The judge noted Eidson\u2019s were the most glowing authentic character references he had seen. Eidson was sentenced to two years jail, serving six months. His wife and daughter, who by now become a citizen in her assumed name, were given good behaviour bonds. Sonja died from cancer in February. Maya, who is due to contest her loss of citizenship in the administrative appeals tribunal in August, said she and her father had assumed the risk of deportation \u2013 in the form of 28 days notice to leave \u2013 would not arise until then. \u201cMy father was still in the grieving process for my mum as she only passed away a few months ago,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was really just at home minding his own business, not hurting anybody or doing anything to anyone, and just trying to get over his loss when all this happened. \u201cIt seems just a bit harsh, really. A bit of an overkill.\u201d Katter went further. \u201cThis sort of thing that happened last night to Patton, it terrifies people.\u201d The immigration department spokeswoman said the Eidsons had \u201chad their case comprehensively assessed over many years by the department, the courts, various ministers and the administrative appeals tribunal\u201d. \u201cMr Eidson has failed in his bid to obtain a visa and he has been detained ahead of his removal from Australia,\u201d she said. \u201cThe department treats all cases of migration and identity fraud very seriously.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
