Sort of. On tonight's Euro 2012 Football Daily, James Richardson has Barry Glendenning, Paul Doyle and Amy Lawrence on hand to look back on England's 1-0 victory over Ukraine, which sets Roy's Boys up for a quarter-final against Italy. Woof. Barney Ronay shares his excitement - and not just about 'man fighting' and his condom-filled hotel minibar. Elsewhere in Group D, France lost 2-0 to Sweden, which means that it's Les Bleus who'll face Spain in the knock-out stages. Finally, because we're now at the halfway stage of the tournament, we pick a few of our highs and lows from the last 12 days in Poland and Ukraine. Like the players, we're having a rest day tomorrow, but join us again on Thursday night when we'll analyse the first quarter-final between Czech Republic v Portugal and Rafa Honigstein will help us to look forward to Germany v Greece."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
