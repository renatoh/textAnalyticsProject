NOT GOING... GONE? When is a story no story at all? What's that you say? When it's another \"story\" cobbled together by a lazy tea-time email that clearly has little or no regard for the readers who pay its wages and who quite frankly deserve far better than this. Erm, yes, quite possibly. But we were thinking more of the story, or non-story, involving Ruud van Nistelrooy, his agent Rodger Linse and a juicy summer move to Barcelona, which our less cultured readers might like to learn is in Spain. \"It's crazy to think that Ruud will be playing for Barcelona next year because he [only] renewed his contract for two more years in January,\" Linse told Spanish radio station RAC1, having first met with the club's chief suit Joan Laporta to talk pesetas over paella. \"I don't want to say that it's impossible because I'm not Manchester United, nor do I represent them,\" he added. \"But this does not mean that Ruud doesn't want to go to Barca - only that in the, ahem, current situation, he has four years left with United.\" If you want the truth, however, best get it straight from the horse's mouth. \"I am happy at Manchester United,\" neighed Ruud, as manutd.com bolted the door. \"I recently signed a new contract and I wouldn't have committed my future to the club if I wasn't... blah-de-blah-de-blah... the fans are second to none... reports of me leaving are just wild rumours... etc. and so on.\" But then he would say that, wouldn't he? And you'd expect a United suit to brand the rumour \"rubbish\". Maybe, for once, this non-story's actually a story. In which case, you can't have your money back and an apology would be nice. * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"It is only about results and points, never mind the performance\" - Ged Houllier tells Liverpool fans what they've known for several years now. * * * * * * * * * * * * ON THE 'EAD SON! There's a great deal of skill to be admired in the noble art of head-butting. At least that's what Big Duncan Ferguson told us as he attempted to non-surgically remove the Fiver's brain during a six-stretch in the mid-90s. But it's clearly not the kind of wisdom young Zat Knight's ever been on the receiving end of, what with the lad choosing Fulham's clash with Blackburn Rovers to fine-tune his own technique. We can't recall too much of the mad Scot's masterclass, but we're sure that attempting to split a rival's forehead in front of a packed stadium and the Sky cameras definitely wasn't mentioned. Lanky Blackburn frontman Jon Stead tumbled to the ground clutching his bonce in the 14th minute of last night's encounter as Knight shuffled nonchalantly away from the scene - and given referee Mike Dean's sudden and chronic myopia, he might have got away with it. But alas, several cameramen were on hand when the FA came knocking today, demanding to review the evidence. The Fulham defender got his defence in early, telling Lahn's Lahn E' Staaaaanah: \"It was handbags, that's all.\" But Graeme Souness doesn't think so. \"He should have been sent off!\" he harrumphed after the game, from the comfort of his new greenhouse. \"Zat won't be proud of it when he sees it on TV.\" \"He deliberately caught me on the eye!\" chirped Stead this afternoon, collaring the same hack who had just had his ear bent by Knight [just a turn of phrase, lawyers]. But Fulham boss Chris Coleman is having none of it. \"Zat's a nice lad,\" he shrugged, fooling nobody. \"I think he [just] put his head to Stead... if the ref had seen it he might have been sent off, but he didn't and it's as simple as that.\" The FA's Disciplinary Division, however, may beg to differ - we're assuming they don't just want the video to tape tonight's instalment of Holby City. * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Ronaldinho to Chelsea for \u00a350m.

He met with Irish boss Brian Kerr last week and made it clear he wanted to be considered for international duty again. Keane quit international football following his highly-publicised bust-up with former international boss Mick McCarthy shortly before the 2002 World Cup finals. Now that Bolton are almost certainly assured of being a Premiership team again next season, Jay-Jay Okocha is willing to talk about a new deal. And John Gregory has agreed on an undisclosed sum as settlement for the dispute with Derby over the training methods which led to him leaving the club. * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV &amp; RADIO ITV1: Football League Extra (1.35am) Celebrity Sporting Encounters don't stop for Easter, you know.
