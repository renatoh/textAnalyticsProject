Ageing actors find themselves squeezed out or humiliated. And things don't seem to be improving much. Recently, we've had Away from Her and Iris, both purporting to address dementia, but declining to face up to its harsh realities. The Bucket List did a similar job on cancer. This summer, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino have been forced to appear in trash to stay on-screen in their declining years. Meryl Streep's been reduced to either a harridan or a figure of fun. Angelica Huston, currently playing herself as a mad old bag in the latest of Orange's pitch ads, epitomises the movies' contempt for the elderly. Still, one act of shining virtue can atone for a multitude of sins. Young@Heart doesn't just show Hollywood how to represent the elderly. It also teaches the rest of us how we should view them. The film is a documentary covering six weeks in the life of a small-town Massachusetts choir whose members' average age is 81. They specialise in rock, punk and disco, and are tackling new and challenging material for an upcoming, sold-out concert. There's just one problem: members keep dying. Cue the saccharine, you might think. But no, not here. The horror of ageing isn't ducked. Ugliness, obesity and degeneration are calmly confronted, rather than air-brushed away. However, they aren't used to evoke pity or inspire guilt. These seniors don't want to be pitied, still less looked after. What's more, they don't need to be. They're driving themselves down the last mile of life's journey (literally as well as figuratively), and they're determined to stay at the wheel till the end of the road. Their choirmaster (aged 55, since you ask) isn't comforting; he's tough. He wants them to deliver, not relax. And so do they. They ignore their doctors' urgings to forego rehearsals for the sake of their health, determined to go out with an earlier bang than a later whimper. The only care they care about is the care they can give to others. This they succeed in providing, even to inmates of the county jail, by the power of the music they continue to be able to generate. The implication seems to be that instead of encouraging old people to beg for our help, we should allow them do what they can on their own. If the effort kills them, so what? Better to die in the throes of self-realisation, than to hang on for a less glorious end. Our elders can help us, rather than we them, if only we'll let them, not least by showing us what life really has to offer. Few films have something so important to say, and this one manages to say what it has to say well. It's beautifully made in the old-fashioned documentary style. There's no preening Michael Moore or Morgan Spurlock, just well-engineered exposition. And all of this is brought to us under the banner of Rupert Murdoch's Fox Searchlight. How come? Well, it has to be said that Hollywood didn't manage the task on its own. The film is actually based on a Channel 4 series made by the British husband-and-wife producer/director team of Sally George and Stephen Walker. Its premiere at the Los Angeles film festival provoked an unexpected bidding war, from which Searchlight emerged triumphant. So, it took British TV to teach Hollywood how to portray America's old folks? Maybe, but don't knock it. Searchlight has done the film proud, digitally remastering it and getting it onto hundreds of US screens. Ironically, only eight cinemas are hosting its UK launch. Which reminds us why Hollywood gave old people such a wide berth in the first place. We don't want to know about them. Still, if you can get to see this film, it will tell you why we should."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
