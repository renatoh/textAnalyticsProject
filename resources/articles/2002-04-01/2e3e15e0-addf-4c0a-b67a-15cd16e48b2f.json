Americans suit Glover's kooky humour, and enjoyable chapters on DJs and talkshow hosts in New York, Las Vegas, Chicago and California suggest the whole book should have been a US odyssey; for the sections on Anglophone radio in Austria, Lebanon and Belgium feel like fillers, and suffer from a familiar failing in travel writing: the assumption that everything that happens has to be included. Shutterbabe Deborah Copaken Kogan (Mainstream, \u00a39.99) Kogan snapped wars, coups and crime from 1988-92, transformed by photojournalism in her youthful imagination from arty, suburban Harvard graduate to reckless, raunchy cartoon heroine combining the political passion of Martha Gellhorn with the sexual shopping of Candace Bushnell. So her period as \"Shutterbabe\" was brief and distant, and much of this memoir covers other parts of her life. Only when she's recalling bedmates and adventures in Afghanistan, Romania and Russia does the book come fully to life, vividly conveying both the addictive attraction and the dodgy artificiality of covering killing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
