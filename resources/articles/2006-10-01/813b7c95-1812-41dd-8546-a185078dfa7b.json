The time when the sister of either a mother or father actually meant something in a child's life has probably gone for good. Instead there's a whole army of pseudo-aunties - anyone from the childminder to daddy's girlfriend - who take on the functions previously carried out by a woman with a Hillman Imp and a dachshund, who could be relied upon to send you a classic novel for your birthday. Still, says Rupert Christiansen, in this charming, clever and quirky study, that's no reason to let the aunt slide unremembered into the dust box of history. Instead, we should celebrate her while she is still, just about, a figure who means something to most of us. And so he sets off on a wonderful treasure hunt to discover the best, worst, naughtiest, nastiest and most glamorous (not all of them have moustaches) aunts in 20th-century life and literature. In anyone else's hands, this anthology could have ended up as a slapdash canter through some already over-used and slightly camp sources (Wooster's Aunt Agatha, Dorothy's Aunty Em and the incomparable Aunt Ada Doom and her primal woodshed scene). But Christiansen has dug deep to find some forgotten jewels of aunty lit. There is, for instance, a wonderful short story from Kipling called \"The Gardener\", in which an aunt manages to coax her sickly orphaned nephew to splendid manhood, only to lose him at Ypres. Then there is the pleasure of revisiting Just William's job-lot of bad-tempered aunts who scowl and glare and sniff and wonder out loud why the boy has turned out so badly. Saki's even beastlier aunts make an appearance (based, apparently, on his own equally loathsome aunts Augusta and Charlotte), as do George Eliot's comic chorus of self-righteous Midlands nags who fret and poke at their hapless niece Maggie Tulliver until, in an act of slashing rebellion, she hacks off all her hair. As this last example suggests, Christiansen is not afraid to take on iconic texts and lives, reordering them through their family relations. Jane Austen, for instance, reveals herself to be a model aunt, treating her nieces as both equals and playfellows, taking their not-very-good writing seriously and urging them on to the sort of love affairs that she never quite managed for herself. Austen's literary aunts, by contrast, fall far short of these exacting standards. Darcy's aunt, Lady Catherine de Burgh, is a monster of self-regard, while Fanny Price's aunts Bertram and Norris are, respectively, a passive-aggressive tyrant and a bully. Interestingly, one of Austen's few helpful literary aunts turns out to be that liminal thing, an aunt by marriage. In Pride and Prejudice it is Mrs Bennet's brother's wife, Mrs Gardiner, who is able to give Lizzy the kind of calm, straight-speaking advice in which the species is supposed to specialise. And yet, for every over-bearing bully and sensible type, there are plenty of other aunts who leave a much fainter footprint upon the world. One of the most moving sections in Christiansen's book concerns all those women who drudged for their families' greater good while receiving little personal reward or recognition. There is Athena (Thena) Clough, who spent 10 years scurrying around after her Aunt Annie, a bossy, banal little body who founded Newnham College, Cambridge. While on the outside Thena was all forbearing smiles, her diary from that time spits venom at the way her publicity-grabbing aunt has turned her into a mere \"dog\", obliged to scuttle around the college like a human spaniel. At least Thena eventually got her revenge. The posthumous biography that she wrote of Aunt Annie, while full of sticky surface sentiment, is strafed through with dark little digs at Miss Clough's soppy ways and ghastly dress sense. Then, in 1920, came a final settling of accounts when Thena, having initially done her usual thing of saying she wasn't worth it, succeeded as the principal of Newnham, triumphantly blotting out the memory of dear, despised Aunt Annie. Other sidelined women managed to find less oblique ways of fighting back. For 20 years Caroline Herschel stood by with a notebook while her more famous brother William peered into the night sky, searching out previously unknown nebulae (together they managed to nail 2,500 of these elusive will o' the wisps ). When William decided to marry at the age of 49 and take his telescope to live in Slough, Caroline was swept into lodgings. Only her own brisk good sense, and the lucky arrival of a baby nephew who turned out to be a maths prodigy, prevented Caroline from being consigned to dusty semi-retirement. Finding a new lease of intellectual life, she nabbed eight comets in her own right, won the gold medal from the Astronomical Society and enjoyed a prosperous old age, thanks to a handsome pension from George III. The Complete Book of Aunts is the kind of title that will probably get heavily promoted for Christmas. But, just like Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves or Schott's Miscellany, it is much more than a gimmicky attempt to cash in on the seasonal market. Contained within Christiansen's deceptively transparent prose, you will find a clever, subtle and stealthily moving book. \u00b7 Kathryn Hughes's biography of Mrs Beeton is published by Harper Perennial"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
