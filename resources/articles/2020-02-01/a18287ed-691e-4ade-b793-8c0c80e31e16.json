The morning after he had finally achieved his goal of removing the UK from the European club, Downing Street released photographs of the prime minister triumphantly striking a gong on the stroke of 11pm (midnight Brussels time) as this country took its leave. The text from a short speech he made as the clock struck 11 was also released. \u201cI want you all to remember you were here tonight after 11pm, in Downing Street, when we got Brexit done,\u201d Johnson told a gathering of advisers, civil servants and Brexit supporters inside No 10. \u201cThis is a fantastic moment in the life of our country. There are very few moments that can be called a historic turning point \u2013 and this is it. This is not the end, or the beginning of the end; it\u2019s the beginning of the beginning,\u201d he told his cheering guests. \u201cWe took back control tonight, we did it. This is a turning point in the life of our nation.\u201d As he hit the gong with glee, he was just flexing his muscles for more combat with the UK\u2019s now ex-partners. There now begins an 11-month transition period during which the prime minister and his government will face the herculean task of securing a future trading and security relationship with the EU. If there is no deal by 31 December, the UK will face a cliff-edge descent into the economic unknown. Before phase two of the process, No 10 went out of its way yesterday to make clear that Johnson \u2013 emboldened at having achieved Brexit where Theresa May had failed \u2013 will give not an inch when the fight resumes. The prime minister will make a speech on Monday saying the UK will be seeking to make a hardline trade deal in less than a year that is \u201cat least as ambitious\u201d as that struck by Canada with the EU in 2017, after seven years of very difficult negotiations. And he will make no concessions to ease an agreement into being. The EU is making clear its bottom lines. It insists that the UK must accept alignment with its rules on workers\u2019 rights, the environment and state aid, as the price for a deal (fearing that otherwise the UK will steal a competitive advantage). But Johnson will say that his government will make no such concessions, under any circumstances. There will be no alignment whatsoever. The EU is also insisting that its members should be allowed access to UK fishing waters before any trade deal can be reached, and that it wants a future role for the European court of justice in any disputes with the UK. Again Johnson will resist. Downing Street also did nothing to knock down reports that the UK is preparing to impose full customs and border checks on all European goods entering Britain, to try to increase pressure on the bloc to give way in the negotiations, which are due to start next month. Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, warned that UK companies would pay a heavy price for delays caused by such checks. \u201cBoth importers and exporters need the UK government to take practical steps to ensure the flow of goods through our ports from 31 December,\u201d he said. \u201cCosts add up with every additional procedure or delay \u2013 and every pound spent on new compliance measures would be a pound less for training, equipment or securing new customers.\u201d A government source said last night: \u201cThere are only two likely outcomes in negotiation, a free trade deal like Canada or a looser arrangement like Australia \u2013 and we are happy to pursue both.\u201d EU sources responded by saying that if the British government sought an Australian-style deal involving tariffs on some goods, it would be \u201cimpossible\u201d to reach an agreement by the end of 2020. \u201cGiven No 10\u2019s timeline of 11 months \u2013 in practice, only eight [for a deal to be ratified] \u2013 for negotiations, the only possible outcomes by the end of the year are a zero-tariffs, zero-quotas free trade agreement or no deal and World Trade Organisation terms,\u201d the source said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t serious to suggest that a line-by-line tariff negotiation can take place in that timeframe. It would be materially and politically impossible.\u201d Last night, Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary and the favourite to succeed Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader, said the kind of Brexit Johnson was pursuing would damage the country and its economy. Starmer said: \u201cJohnson either doesn\u2019t understand or doesn\u2019t care about the damage the Brexit deal he is proposing will do to the country. \u201cIt would weaken workers\u2019 rights, consumer and environmental standards, and lead to significant barriers to trade with the EU. By choosing to pursue a hard Brexit, he will also ensure that the Northern Irish economy becomes more detached from the rest of the UK.\u201d Dacian Ciolo\u0219, a former prime minister of Romania who leads Emmanuel Macron\u2019s Renew group in the European parliament, said that Brexit had brought the relationship between the UK and EU to \u201ca low moment\u201d. \u201cNevertheless, I am confident that both the EU and the UK will find the best agreement to collaborate in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cAs in any relationship, this agreement must be balanced and doors have to be opened on both sides. The extent to which the EU can be open and make concessions will depend strongly on the extent to which the British government will be willing to cooperate. But, obviously, a deal can never be as good as EU membership.\u201dBrexit may be done in one respect, but in many others it has a long way to go."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
