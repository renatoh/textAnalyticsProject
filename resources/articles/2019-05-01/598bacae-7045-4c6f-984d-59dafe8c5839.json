Which is ridiculous, because *cue The Life of Brian* \u201cYou\u2019re all individuals!\u201d... and have the capacity to make our minds up for ourselves. But whatever your reasons might be for considering ditching the dairy, there\u2019s one thing you can\u2019t deny: dairy is delicious. Dairy has been an intrinsic part of our global food culture, which can be traced as far back as 7,900 years, to central European civilisation. In that time, we\u2019ve taken it into the heart of how we eat, all around the world. No matter where you travel around the globe, if there\u2019s food, there\u2019s dairy. And it\u2019d be a damn shame to see us let go of parts of our food identity in this generation. From wobbly Italian panna cotta to silky Vietnamese banh flan, the way a spoon slides into a French cr\u00e8me caramel or the texture of a creamy cinnamon-spiked English rice pudding, all major food cultures of the world, have historically embraced dairy. As a food writer, knowing what\u2019s good when it comes to food and drink is obviously par for the course. And while there are definitely circumstances where even I can admit that it matters less, the truth is that when it comes to truly excellent food - from fine dining to your dining room table - you can do it without dairy \u2026 it just might not be as good. Ask any chef worth their salt, and they\u2019ll tell you that both the flavour profile and compositional properties of dairy aren\u2019t things you can substitute, without sacrificing at least something in flavour, or texture. The commercial restaurant industry is largely indebted to the redeeming qualities of dairy, from the butter that makes that roast chicken jus so glossy, to why milk buns are the softest, most cloud-like of all the buns in the burger universe. I should make a caveat here and say that my argument isn\u2019t about dietary choices and reasons. This is an argument for flavour, texture and culture, so if you\u2019re intolerant (dietary or otherwise), maybe keep on scrolling. When writing about food - or judging it critically - for me, it must always come down to deliciousness. From wobbly Italian panna cotta to silky Vietnamese banh flan, the way a spoon slides into a French cr\u00e8me caramel or the texture of a creamy cinnamon-spiked English rice pudding, all major food cultures of the world, have historically embraced dairy. Can you make these beloved dishes dairy-free? In some cases, sure. But from a critical or even emotional perspective, do these dairy-free versions taste better than the real thing? Sorry, but I\u2019m here to tell you the answer is pretty much always no. Why? For one, the fat content in food is what gives it flavour. It\u2019s the fat content in dairy that not only makes it a healthy, balanced ingredient, but also increases the depth of flavour and lends a textural richness to dishes it contains. And then there\u2019s the structural composition. The way dairy proteins split and bond according to temperature, ph level and treatment also contributes to giving certain dishes or components like sauces and dressing the feeling of luxury when it hits your mouth. Let\u2019s face it, dairy is probably a decent contributor to why food often tastes better at a restaurant than it does at home. Of course, great strides have been made in product development to make non-dairy alternatives more palatable and closer in experience than the real thing. But if we\u2019re told for our health that we should choose whole foods over highly processed foods; then why consume something engineered to taste \u2018real\u2019, when you can just have the real thing? Why consume something engineered to taste \u2018real\u2019, when you can just have the real thing? With each year comes a new health recommendation that we should cut out something entirely or eat more of something else. The fact remains, that a reasonably balanced diet consisting of whole foods, is probably a good way to go for most of us. Should you eat a diet purely based on dairy? Probably not. But going extreme and cutting something out entirely if there\u2019s zero medical or ethical reason for you to? It\u2019s your body (your choice), just don\u2019t try to convince me mylk tastes better than the real deal. When writing about food - or judging it critically - for me, it must always come down to deliciousness. It\u2019s the ultimate meritocracy, using the best ingredient for the job. All I\u2019m saying is that, if that ingredient happens to be dairy, then that\u2019s ok with me. What matters to you, matters to us too.
