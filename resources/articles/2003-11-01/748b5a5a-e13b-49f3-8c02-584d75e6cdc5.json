A letter has been issued by a consortium of businessmen requesting support from fellow shareholders for a notice of motion at next month's AGM. If 100 shareholder signatories are found, the application for dismissal will be put to a vote. It is believed that none of the consortium holds more than 3% of the shares; they are therefore not entitled to boardroom representation. The letter, which has been seen by the Guardian, accuses Brown and his fellow directors of \"a dereliction of duties\", alleging that \"the cost of providing redundancy packages to the current executive board is nothing compared to the financial losses suffered by the company under their management, let alone the effect on the football club\". Mike Hanna, a shareholder and the former chair of a supporters' group, is acting as a spokesperson for the consortium. He says the group was forced to act because of the dismay felt after the board's statements at the last shareholder assembly. Hanna, a business and commercial adviser to a major oil company, claims confidence in the board was eroded after an EGM was called last May asking to change the club's articles of association. The consortium claims this was in order to alter the covenants restricting borrowing beyond three times the club's net assets, which stood at \u00a313.3m. It says that with \u00a337.5m outstanding in loans and a further \u00a37.5m in overdrafts, West Ham would have been in default of their borrowing restrictions - and therefore liable to an independent audit - had those articles of association not been changed by May 31. \"The directors had to put themselves in a position in a matter of days where they would not be in breach of their articles of association,\" said Hanna. \"It appeared that the company did not want independent auditors looking at the books. \"That is not the way you are allowed to conduct business anywhere else. This board has got us into a situation where we have been relegated and are heavily in debt. Can we get out of it with them? No.\" Brown holds 36.6% of the shares, 25% belong to Charles Warner, the club solicitor and chair of the Hills family trust, and Martin Cearns has about 14%. The consortium has called for the temporary appointment of Trevor Brooking in the directors' stead, although last night Brooking denied any involvement in the attempted coup."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
