Essentially a comic paean to anarchism, it stars the great Michel Simon, France's answer to Charles Laughton, as a Parisian tramp who's rescued from suicide by a kindly, middle-aged bookseller. But instead of showing a proper gratitude to his saviour and benefactor, the unrepentant clochard sets about seducing his host's wife and creating maximum disorder in his cosy household. Boudu is a deceptively rough-looking black-and-white film with long takes and sound recorded on location."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
