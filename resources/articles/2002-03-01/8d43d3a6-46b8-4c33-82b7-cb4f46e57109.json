A spokesman for the privately owned group, which is thereatening to buckle under debts of up to \u00a38bn, said he expected talks to resume after the Easter holidays. \"There will be no official announcement today... the discussions have to be continued next week,\" he said. Kirch's lending banks and shareholders, including Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and Silvio Berlusconi's Mediaset, have so far failed to agree a rescue deal. The banks, including Deutsche Bank and Bayerische Landesbank, the main bank in Kirch's home state of Bavaria, want the shareholders to contribute to an injection of around \u00a3490m into the group to keep it solvent. In exchange, the shareholders will take control of KirchMedia, the group's media operation and owner of the prized ProSiebenSat.1 commercial broadcaster. The banks have also asked News Corp and Mediaset to come up with a sustainable rescue plan, to ensure that Kirch has a long-term future. If Kirch is rescued, it will bring to an end 75-year-old Leo Kirch's control of an empire which he started building nearly 50 years ago."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
