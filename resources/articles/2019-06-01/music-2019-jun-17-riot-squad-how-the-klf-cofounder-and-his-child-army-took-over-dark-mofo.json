It can only be seen and discussed, not known.\u201d Consider this, then, to be a discussion. As one half of British electronic band the KLF, Cauty not only drew on English ritual and folklore but created his own. He and fellow artist/musician Bill Drummond burned their own wicker man during a summer solstice ceremony, had dancers dressed in druid robes, created a crop circle of their pyramid blaster logo in wheat for the What Time Is Love video, and buried their Brit award in 1992 for best British group in a field near Stonehenge \u2013 or so legend has it. These days, Cauty specialises in what you might call urban folk horror. His installation at the seventh Dark Mofo is a diorama of a dystopian version of Bedford, housed in a 40ft shipping container. Britain is ripe inspiration for these disquieting fictional locations, perhaps even more so in this post-Brexit landscape. In recent years the country has inspired graphic designer Richard Littler\u2019s book depicting Scarfolk \u2013 a supposed northern English town informed by the macabre public information advertisements of the 1970s; and Banksy\u2019s Dismaland Bemusement Park (in which an early incarnation of ADP made its debut) \u2013 a 2015 pop-up in the all-too-real seaside destination of Weston-super-Mare. Further back, in the 1990s and early 2000s, there was Royston Vasey, the small closeted town depicted in the surreal comedy series The League of Gentlemen. They\u2019re places populated with tightly buttoned killjoys, sexually repressed jobsworths and curtain-twitching wet blankets. Middle Englanders, in other words. Refreshingly, in Cauty\u2019s vision, the kids in hoodies are taking over. For ADP\u2019s installation outside Hobart Town Hall he\u2019s recruited local youth to be the Children of the Aftermath, essentially the stewards and tour guides of his creation. By night they mill around it, giving their animated version of events inside the container to the passing public. People peer through peepholes at the tiny overturned police cars, tower blocks with smashed windows and defaced billboards. It\u2019s only lacking the reek of stale urine and smoke, though maybe that\u2019ll be fixed by the end of its tenure here. The outside of the container is covered in graffiti, though Cauty knocked back actual graffiti artists who offered their services. To quote the ADP propaganda poster, \u201cvandalism is tolerated, but not art\u201d. It\u2019s members of the public \u2013 throughout the UK Riot tour of the ADP \u2013 that have done the honours. Even when the kids are off-duty, ADP seems to engage random passersby much more successfully than many free artworks. Why kids? Apart from the fact that they distance the ADP from the art establishment, on a practical level they\u2019ll get excited and tell all their friends. In their chav uniforms (some hoodies are so big as to appear as dresses on the youngest members) they also bring the threat of a modern-day Lord of the Flies or suggest an overthrowing of older generations. Perhaps that\u2019s already happened in the post-riot scene inside the ADP. An unexpected bonus was the kids gave Cauty further insight into his work by asking him unexpected, lateral questions. It made him comfortable with the idea of them imparting their own interpretations of ADP to the viewer. ADP took three years to construct, with the costs stretching far beyond Cauty\u2019s initial calculations. The chief benefactor was Steve Lowe, a gallerist and artist from London\u2019s L-13 Light Industrial Workshop who has long working relationships with Cauty and other artists such as Billy Childish, and who came to Hobart armed with spare figures and gravel to patch the diorama up after its sea voyage. Each stop on the ADP Riot Tour \u2013 which has mainly taken in the UK so far, with the odd stop in Europe \u2013 was once the site of an uprising. Perhaps it harks back to his squatter roots, but rioting has been Cauty\u2019s main interest in the past decade, through his Riot in a Jam Jar series (circa 2011) and the Smiley Riot Shield (circa 2014), in which appropriated police riot shields have been painted over with the acid house smiley-face graphic, a symbol of the scene Cauty once inhabited with the KLF. He\u2019s also married to Alannah Currie, an artist (and former Thompson Twin) who has made her own instruments of nuisance and with whom he formed the Armchair Destructivists, hell-bent on destroying her upholstered creations in increasingly elaborate, violent ways. When Dark Mofo came calling, a riot site was found in Hobart Town Hall, which was besieged by protesters when Pauline Hanson spruiked her new One Nation party there in 1997. In the week prior to its installation on the street outside, ADP also made a top-secret visit to the local Risdon prison. The jail has seen riots in the last couple of years over the re-introduction of a prisoner to maximum security and losing access to nicotine patches, but most memorably in 2005 when a guard was taken hostage, then released in exchange for 15 pizzas. ADP might yet embark on a further tour of Australian sites before reversing the convict route on a ship headed back home. Cauty is already back at his London HQ \u2013 a workshop with \u201cMr J Cauty Esq Model Village Builders Est 1956\u201d above the door. He is working on his next project, ESTATE, a series of tower blocks built to 1/30 scale, again the scene of an aftermath. This time the dioramas are entirely abandoned by people. Or at least, they are so far; perhaps they will later become overrun with miniature children, says Lowe. When Guardian Australia visited the workshop in May, the detail inside the first tower was incredible. \u201cCometh the hour, cometh estate\u201d is daubed on the wall of a deserted laundromat. On tiny televisions in some flats there runs a news bulletin \u2013 filmed and scored by Cauty \u2013 that uses footage of politician Amber Rudd to horrific effect. Peer in even closer and you\u2019ll see that the pattern on the wallpaper is actually Margaret Thatcher\u2019s head. Other flats are reduced to piles of tiny bricks and stray toilet rolls, with mathematical equations spray-painted on the walls. Cauty\u2019s not yet sure where ESTATE will be toured upon its projected completion in 2020. He might dump it on wasteland unannounced, he says. He is funding the remainder of the build by selling off membership to the ESTATE residents association and brochures about expressions of interest for right to buy units \u2013 inventive merch, in other words. Call it your legacy for the kids."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
