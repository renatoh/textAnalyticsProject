But the intertwining of those European and American roots has been making Surman an original since the 1970s. These days, he plays everything from string-quartet jazz to freebop via Arabian music, but these 15 short pieces find him at his most reflective, in duet with Howard Moody playing an Oslo church organ. The classically trained Moody doesn't chase Surman's improvising, but sets moods for it. There are typically song-like originals and adaptations, a West Country traditional, and two free improvisations. Surman's vocal-like Circum 1, for soprano sax, suggests the choirboy he once was in pure-toned dialogue with the organ's chords, while the same instrument is breezier over a hurdy-gurdy-like sound on The Old Dutch. The baritone-sax pieces curl like wood smoke over Moody's deep, reverberating hum, and the wry bass clarinet groover Dancing in the Loft finds Surman's melodic ingenuity caressed by high, whistling sounds from the keys. Some pieces whoop and soar over churning rhythms, while Dark Reeds is a slow baritone tone-poem, and the traditionals O Waly Waly and I'm Troubled in Mind are hauntingly solemn. As befits an exploration of timbre, the recording is immaculate, and only the tethering of the improvising to long, tonal centres occasionally taxes Surman."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
