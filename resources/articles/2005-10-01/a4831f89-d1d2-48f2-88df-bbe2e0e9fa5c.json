In spinning off the hotels, property and travel divisions, it will bring to an end the conglomerate vision of the chief executive, Henry Silverman. Mr Silverman, one of the highest-paid bosses in corporate America, spoke yesterday of management's \"frustration\" that the benefits of scale and diversity had not been reflected in the share price. \"I wouldn't say we were forced into it [breaking up Cendant]. The collective wisdom was that what we were doing was not working from a shareholder value perspective.\" Following the demergers, which are planned for next summer, Mr Silverman will continue to preside over the car rental rump of the Cendant empire, which operates under the Avis and Budget brands. He will become non-executive chairman at the Real Estate firm. The Cendant chief executive, who has been criticised for receiving tens of millions of dollars in pay as Cendant's shares lost value, said the break-up would not lead to the crystallising of his 38m shares and options. Cendant's travel division, which has been bolstered in recent times with a string of acquisitions, will include brands such as the US websites Cheaptickets and Orbitz, and ebookers, the formerly London-listed site acquired for $400m last year. The division also includes the British-based hotel and tour wholesaling group Gullivers Travel Associates, bought by Cendant last year for \u00a31.1bn. The hotels business will include the Days Inn and Ramada brands, while the property firm will include the brokerage Century 21. The Cendant break-up follows the unwinding of Barry Diller's IAC/InterActiveCorp, which last year spun off its Expedia travel website. Yesterday Cendant warned that terrorism, hurricanes, oil prices and economic weakness in Europe had hit the group. Mr Silverman said he had reined in revenue growth expectations for 2006 from 11% to 10%. Cendant was born through the 1997 merger of Mr Silverman's HFS franchising business and the rival CUC International. A rapid acquisition programme included buying Britain's NCP, the car park and Green Flag roadside recovery group. But a year after its formation, Cendant's spending spree was abruptly halted by the discovery of a trail of fraudulent earnings inflation at CUC before the merger. The accounting fraud wiped \u00a314bn off the company's market value in one day, making it a precursor to the wave of corporate scandals that hit Wall Street shortly afterwards. Three months ago, the former CUC vice-president Kirk Shelton was sentenced to 10 years in jail for his part in the fraud. Cendant shares never regained their previous ratings as investors and analysts shunned the stock, which has no peers against which to be measured. The group spun off its mortgage-services business PHH last year and separately floated a tax company and a car fleet firm. The measures were viewed as piecemeal and shares failed to rally as hoped. Under the latest, more radical, break-up plans, the name of Cendant will pass into US corporate history."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
