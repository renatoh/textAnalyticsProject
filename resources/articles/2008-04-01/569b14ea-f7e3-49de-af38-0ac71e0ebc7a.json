You're doing a sponsored run or swim or urban fox cull, and you're going door to door doffing cap and thrusting begging bowl. Most of the people you meet are so generous that you leave with tears in your eyes, humming that Billy Bragg song about the milkman of human kindness. Then you come across the meanie who breaks your day. Not the one who doesn't let you in the house. Nor the one who tells you she doesn't agree with charity because it is the crack of the masses. Not even the sanctimonious bore who lectures you about the incompetence of the organisation you're raising money for. No, you come across the bloke (invariably a bloke) who asks how many miles you are going to run, works it out in his head, says \"Well, let's just think about this,\" tuts aloud as he makes his huge sacrifice, looks you in the face with a superior smile, waits for a show of quivering gratitude, slips you back your piece of paper, says, \"There you go! Now you make sure you earn it\", and slides his bony finger along the line to reveal he's sponsored you tuppence a mile. Next time it happens you can comfort yourself with the thought that, however stingy this tightwad might be, he is in good company with Barclays, sponsor of football's Premier League. A few weeks ago I read that the bank would sponsor each player \u00a330 for every mile they ran in one match for Sport Relief. I presumed there must have been a mistake - that they were actually sponsoring them \u00a330 a mile for every mile ran that season. Or perhaps they had just missed off a couple of zeros and they were sponsoring \u00a33,000 a mile. But no, \u00a330 a mile it was. Now it does not take a mathematical genius to work out that as there are only 11 players in a team, and as the most industrious players get through around eight miles per match, and as there are only 20 teams in the Premier League, Barclays would end up paying out, on a good day, just short of sod all. And in the greater scheme of things that does not make them look good - which is, after all, the point of corporate sponsorship. Let's put it into perspective. Barclays made \u00a37bn profit last year. In 2006 they signed a three-year sponsorship deal with the Premier League for \u00a365.8m. That's a lot of dosh, but then 500 million people worldwide watch it. Last year the bank launched in India, where 43 million watch the Premier League, with its Premier League branded credit card. The special relationship obviously works both ways. Barclays has put a lot into football. The bank has pledged \u00a330m over time to promote sport in the community, and no doubt they make plenty of other charitable donations. But why was it so miserly on the Sport Relief front? As anticipated, the takings at the end of the sponsored run were embarrassing and last weekend's press release was not one of Barclays' finest moments. Mathieu Flamini was crowned the winner, having covered most ground in the games between March 15-17. He ran more than eight miles in Arsenal's 1-1 draw against Middlesbrough raising - da-daa - 240 quid and a bit. (Disappointingly, Barclays cannot give out other results because of a confidentiality clause, though this column has learned from sources at the bank that Manchester City's Dieter Hamann raised an invaluable \u00a37.32 after covering very nearly a quarter of a mile.) Overall, 1,454.3 miles were run, which means players, including goalkeepers, ran an impressive average 6.6 miles per game. The total raised was a somewhat less impressive \u00a343,629, which Barclays magnaminously rounded up to \u00a355,000. Fifty-five thousand quid! That's the very figure that caused an appalled Ashley Cole almost to swerve his Bentley off the road when he heard about his proposed new weekly wage at Arsenal. That's around a third of John Terry's weekly salary. You couldn't buy a night out in Cheetham Hill with a Wes Brown lookalike for 55 grand. Fifty-five grand! Ian Botham, a man who walks with elephants rather than a global giant that employs 134,900 people, single-handedly raised more than \u00a38m for charity. Fifty-five grand! Jane Tomlinson, an inspiring woman with cancer who ran and cycled unfeasibly long distances rather than a multinational with an \u00a38bn wage bill, raised \u00a31.75m when she was dying. Surely, Barclays must have known that in the context of Premier League wages and transfer fees, their 55 grand would look laughable. So is the goon who dreamed up the scheme going to be promoted for saving them the odd million, or fired for turning Barclays into the Fagin of modern football?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
