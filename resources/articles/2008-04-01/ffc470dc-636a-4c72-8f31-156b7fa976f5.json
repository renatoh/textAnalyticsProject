But anyone planning to question why the athlete with golden locks has not stretched the field tomorrow should check their facts. Firstly, Paula Radcliffe is not running because of the toe injury which scuppered her preparations. Secondly, never mind not doing well, Yelling is hoping for the best performance of her career. And there might be a place at the Olympic Games in Beijing waiting for her as she reaches the line in The Mall. Four years ago in Athens, as Radcliffe's world fell apart when she stopped with three miles of the Olympic marathon to go, Yelling, her friend since they were teenagers, was so determined to finish that she completed the race totally unaware that she had probably run past her Bedford team-mate as she sat in tears on the kerb. \"When I crossed the line I was interviewed [on television] by Sue [Barker] and she asked me what I thought about Paula,\" recalls Yelling. \"I said, 'Did she win, did she win?' and she said, 'No, she didn't even finish.' I was shocked and gutted and it brought a lump to my throat because I knew what it meant to her. \"The only thing I did see was that Paula had missed her bottle at the last drinks station at 40k. I missed mine when I tried to pick it up. I thought, 'Paula has missed hers, so I will be fine.'\" While Yelling's times do not put her among the favourites, she is facing a race with its own pressures. Radcliffe, the world record-holder, and Mara Yamauchi, the British No2, are shoo-ins for Beijing. One place remains in the team, with the first Briton home tomorrow destined to be given the nod. Yelling has the most experience among her domestic rivals in the field but she arrives here after a preparation she would probably not recommend in the coaching guides she gives to supplement her earnings as an athlete. At the end of last year Yelling, 33, and her husband Martin, an international duathlete and triathlete, moved from Loughborough to Bournemouth. Their new house needed so much renovation that for three months they slept in a camper-van in their drive. \"It was cold, it was challenging, it was exciting and you had to learn to relax and take in your stride everything which was thrown at you,\" she says. \"My running was time out from that. \"After Athens we had travelled to New Zealand for six weeks in a van. We fell in love with camper-vanning. We bought the van last summer, it is a 15-year-old Talbot and we use it to go training. We went to Cornwall last year and we might take it to Europe. It is like the size of a Ford transit. But when I've not been running, I've been in overalls. We had to take all the plaster off the walls at the house and I have been shovelling dirt. We moved out of the van at the end of January and the house is getting there.\" Yet their move to Bournemouth also explains why she arrives in London so determined to break her best time of 2:30:44. \"There are eight miles of promenade, starting at Sandbanks, which means you can run very consistently. It's great preparation for the marathon - the white sandy beaches and the sea in the last few days has been lapping up on the shore. It makes you feel alive.\" Yelling is running London for the third time. She was eighth last year and behind the Ethiopians Gete Wami and Berhane Adere there could be a fascinating duel for Olympic qualification between her and Hayley Haining, of Dumfries. Haining, 36, a clinical pathologist at Glasgow Veterinary School, has run a hundredth of a second quicker than her rival but Yelling has no plans to watch her every move. \"I raced against Hayley in Reading about six weeks ago and beat her by 90 seconds over a half-marathon,\" she says, \"but anything can happen in a marathon\" - as Yelling discovered in Athens when she was the first British woman home in 25th. She has become accustomed to running in oppressive weather. She was fourth in Chicago last year in 32C and she says: \"Beijing might be more about who is most prepared in those conditions and who can tolerate it. I am not worried about the heat. It will be the same for everyone. I have exercise-induced asthma, I will have my medication. But we were warned about the pollution in Greece.\" In the men's race tomorrow Martin Lel, of Kenya, will be looking to maintain his superb record. The defending champion is running here for the fourth time, having first won on his debut in 2005. He was second in 2006 to his team-mate Felix Limo, who is back again, but do not be surprised if it becomes a sprint to the line between a group of four of five."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
