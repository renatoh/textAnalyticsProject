With a composed finish eight minutes after half-time, Albion\u2019s club-record signing registered only his fourth goal since arriving for \u00a312m in the summer to book the Premier League club a place in the fourth round and set up a home tie against Peterborough on Saturday week. For Pulis, who picked his strongest available team, the hope is that the goal will do Rond\u00f3n the power of good after a difficult first season in English football in which the Venezuelan has showed plenty of willing but lacked that clinical touch when it matters. While the other good news for Pulis was Ben Foster keeping a clean sheet on only his second appearance since returning from being sidelined for nine months with a cruciate ligament injury, the Albion manager appears to have lost another key player before Saturday\u2019s derby against Aston Villa. Chris Brunt limped off in the 17th minute after pulling a calf muscle and joins James Morrison, Jonas Olsson and Darren Fletcher on the sidelines. Saido Berahino was also absent from the Albion squad with illness and speculation continues that Newcastle are weighing up an \u00a318m move for the striker. \u201cThe valuation will be determined by the chairman,\u201d Pulis said. \u201cI was going to play Saido tonight. But he has picked up a bug that Rickie Lambert and a few other players had.\u201d In truth there was little to choose between the teams on a bitterly cold evening when a humdrum game did nothing to warm the hearts of the supporters. Bristol City will ruefully reflect on their failure to hold onto a 2-1 lead at The Hawthorns, where Morrison scored an injury-time equaliser, and this game could also have panned out differently for them if Wes Burns had converted a presentable chance in the 14th minute. Burns was City\u2019s best player and caused Albion a few problems in the second half, when he saw one shot blocked by Craig Dawson and Foster parry another in the closing stages. Yet City never really played as if they believed they could cause an upset and their season now hinges on recruiting a new manager to steer them clear of relegation. Albion\u2019s goal was simple enough and exposed some poor marking in City\u2019s defence. Dawson floated in a cross from the Albion right and Rond\u00f3n, afforded far too much time in the City area, was able to take the ball down on his chest before beating Max O\u2019Leary, the 19-year-old home keeper who was making his full debut, from no more than six yards. It was Rond\u00f3n\u2019s first goal since October. \u201cSalom\u00f3n is going to be a good player,\u201d Pulis said, before outlining the problems the forward has encountered. \u201cHe\u2019s found it difficult, the Premier League is so intense, which has not been the case where he has played. But the players love him because he works so hard, he\u2019s such a genuine kid, and you could see that in the way they celebrated with him.\u201d Although Gareth McAuley had a good chance earlier in the match, when the defender headed over the bar from six yards, and Craig Gardner thrashed a left-footed volley from the edge of the area narrowly wide, Albion created relatively little. City could, and possibly should, have been ahead when Burns had that excellent opportunity. Running onto Bobby Reid\u2019s pass in the inside right channel, the 21-year-old striker had only Foster to beat but dragged a low shot beyond the far upright. Rond\u00f3n was not so generous when opportunity knocked at the other end. \u201cThere was not a lot in it, but I think the experience showed in the end,\u201d said John Pemberton, who is City\u2019s interim manager following Steve Cotterill\u2019s dismissal last Thursday. \u201cThey\u2019re so well organised and they don\u2019t make mistakes. I think they had one chance and it ended up in the back of our net.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
