In this long-running blame game there is no shortage of candidates. Government ministers blame the courts. The courts blame ministers. The Daily Mail and the Tory right blame Europe. Labour, as usual, blames the government. The police blame the lawyers. Much of the population blames the lot of them. In our view, much of the population is closest to the mark. It is important to remember two things here. The first is that Abu Qatada has not been charged in this country, presumably because prosecutors have not got a strong enough case against him. The second, nevertheless, is that he had no business here in the first place. He is a foreigner who got into the UK on a forged passport. Ministers in successive governments are therefore entitled to try to deport him, partly because he has serious charges to answer in Jordan and partly because foreign jihadists whose activities may threaten the state have no inherent right to remain here in all circumstances, come what may. But Abu Qatada has rights too, even if he is as dangerous as the government believes. One of these is the right not to be handed over by the state to governments which might torture or even kill him. The Home Office is confident that Jordan has made changes to its legal system which ensure this is not the case here. The Special Immigration Appeals Commission took an opposite view this week. The issue may now go to appeal. Be in no doubt, though, that this is a serious subject. Abu Qatada and his lawyers are fully entitled to challenge Jordan's claims. From the start UK ministers have too often brushed these fundamental issues to the margins. This inevitably means the courts have to reassert the rights, as happened on Monday, creating a spiral of events which feed public anxiety about the effectiveness of controls. Ministers have repeatedly blurred their indignation at Abu Qatada's presence here with their responsibility to uphold the rule of law in attempting to remove him, a responsibility that is especially important in highly charged cases. The home secretary, though an improvement on some of her predecessors, was at this again this week. So were the prime minister and the deputy prime minister. Ministers are not alone in deserving some of the blame. The courts have been slow to rule on serious cases which deserve to be dealt with more efficiently. The European court of human rights, with its large backlog of cases, has caused problems of process rather than principle. But ministers need to anticipate these blockages. The less effectively they anticipate such problems, the less right they have to be so indignant about the outcome."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
