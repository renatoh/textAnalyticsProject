It's more a central repository for all your filmed entertainment. Rather than messing around with wobbly stacks of DVDs next to your TV, you can throw one of these in the cupboard under the stairs and you've suddenly got the ability to watch any film you like, wherever there's a TV in the house. Why would I want one of those? Because it's the future, silly. One day, all home entertainment will be viewed this way. Forget hunting round for missing DVDs, or arguing over who is going to watch what, the Kaleidescape holds up to 500 films - more if you buy add-on storage - in one device that then pipes your entertainment choices to every room in the house, should you want it. What's so special about it, though? What isn't? Once you've loaded your favourite movies, you can start having fun. Want to watch nothing but hours of Hollywood's best car chases, or just the battle scenes in The Lord of The Rings: Return of the King? Just create a favourites list and away you go. Watching an \"art\" movie when the kids come home? Just pause the film and retreat to the study where you can pick up where you left off. A four-level parental control system helps keep your favourites out of the prying eyes of your kids - and because the Kaleidescape uses several disk drives you can watch Harold and Maude in the living room while the kids are enjoying Shrek 2 in the kitchen. All this in a style-conscious package, too, eh? It's cooler than any DVD player and more stylish than most PCs, plus it's almost entirely bereft of nasty intrusive buttons. The Kaleidescape's porcelain-style fascia and soft blue lights are likely to draw oohs and aahs of admiration from your neighbours. How easy is it to use? The server is controlled by an onscreen menu that even your granny could operate. Simply connect the server to as many movie players in as many rooms as you want and press for non-stop entertainment. Even if you haven't got 180 DVDs yet, Kaleidescape will handily sell you an instant collection such as the Academy Award Winners, comprising the Oscar winners for best picture from 1930 to 2003. When can I get one? Pretty soon, well, that's if you've got a spare \u00a314,000 kicking around. That much will buy you a base system with a capacity of 180 disks, a DVD reader and one movie player. If you're really serious and want to have access to DVDs in every room in the house, think northwards of \u00a325,000, plus, of course, the redecorating bill you'll have to face once the ethernet-based wiring is installed. Who should I buy one of these for Christmas? It's just perfect as a present for the friend who has everything."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
