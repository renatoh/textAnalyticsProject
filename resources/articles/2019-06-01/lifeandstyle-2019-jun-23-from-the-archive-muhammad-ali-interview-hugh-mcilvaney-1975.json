McIlvanney had previously interviewed Ali just hours after the Rumble in the Jungle fight in Zaire in 1974 and here he turned his attention to just what Ali was going to do after he retired from boxing. Ali is pictured standing outside one of two tower blocks he was planning to buy in Chicago, aiming to do the same as his neighbour, the Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad. \u2018They\u2019ll cost me millions, but they\u2019ll make me money while I\u2019m asleep.\u2019 McIlvanney writes about the house Ali had just bought in Chicago, Woodlawn, as being his \u2018latest exercise in the impossible: his attempt to put down roots on the run\u2019. McIlvanney and a photographer were \u2018trying to hang on to his coat tails\u2019 as he zipped around the US trying to get beyond the \u2018familiar stage act\u2019. And beyond what he called Ali\u2019s \u2018medicine show\u2019, McIlvanney is \u2018touched by a vague melancholy, a sense perhaps of romantic aspirations in collision with nature\u2019. A companion of Ali\u2019s says, \u2018When you\u2019re around, man, they fall out of the sky \u2013 it rains pretty foxes.\u2019 McIlvanney writes: \u2018The interesting point is that these days his umbrella seems to be upside down\u2019, a brilliant euphemism for his JFK-like carousing. McIlvanney worries that, \u2018In the decades to come, restlessness will preclude tranquillity,\u2019 that this will be \u2018part of the great penalty Ali will have to pay for the great flood of wilful energy that has carried him so far in his first 32 years.\u2019 Three years after Ali\u2019s last fight in 1981, he was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s and trying to hold on to some of that wilful energy was probably the greatest challenge he ever faced."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
