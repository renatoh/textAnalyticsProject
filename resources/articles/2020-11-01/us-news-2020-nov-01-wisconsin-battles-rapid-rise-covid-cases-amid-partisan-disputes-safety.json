Perhaps nowhere else are those forces colliding in a more dramatic fashion than in Wisconsin \u2013 a state that has been cripplingly unable to reach consensus on how to effectively respond to the outbreaks ravaging its cities and towns. The nation\u2019s dairy state, which continues to shatter its own records for cases, this week surpassed the grim milestone of 200,000 infections, and rates of transmission show no signs of slowing. Over the past two months, Wisconsin saw its seven-day average \u2013 currently at 4,000 cases \u2013 increase by 400%. As of Thursday, Wisconsin cities represented 10 of the top 20 metro areas with the nation\u2019s highest per capita Covid rates, according to a New York Times analysis. Across the state\u2019s hospital system, 85% of hospital beds and 87% of ICU beds are in use, according to department of health data. \u201cWe need folks to forget the it-won\u2019t-happen to me mentality,\u201d Wisconsin\u2019s Democratic governor Tony Evers said at a press briefing. \u201cWe need people to stop treating this virus as something that\u2019s only happening to other people in other places. This virus is here, and it\u2019s spreading all around us.\u201d While it took the state seven months to notch its first 100,000 cases, that figure then doubled in just 36 days, said Andrea Palm, secretary-designee of the state\u2019s health services department. \u201cIt\u2019s going to get worse before it gets better,\u201d she said. Meanwhile, the state\u2019s Republican-led legislature alongside allied legal groups have continued to challenge and thwart the Democratic governor\u2019s efforts to issue \u201csafer-at-home\u201d orders, mask mandates and limit the size of gatherings \u2013 creating a sense of whiplash as residents have tried to keep pace with rules that seem to be continuously issued, rescinded and issued again. As a result, public safety measures have been largely left up to municipalities and individuals, said Patrick Remington, former epidemiologist for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \u201cThe public has been left confused and bewildered. I\u2019m not surprised that people just decide on their own what\u2019s good for them. Unfortunately, people are making choices to engage in high-risk behaviors \u2013 decisions that the virus is exploiting.\u201d Remington attributes skyrocketing Covid rates in Wisconsin to a convergence of factors. Layered on top of a partisan response to safety precautions, dropping temperatures have driven residents indoors \u2013 sometimes into bars, in keeping with the state\u2019s robust tavern culture, where customers often sit elbow to elbow, unmasked, and shout to be heard over loud music. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening in Wisconsin is a perfect storm,\u201d Remington said. Hoping to recapture the state he narrowly won in 2016, Donald Trump in recent weeks has made repeated visits to the crucial swing state, hosting packed rallies over the objections of doctors and public officials who described the events as reckless and disrespectful to the sacrifices of frontline medical staff. Earlier this week, Trump hosted a rally outside La Crosse, on the state\u2019s western edge, where he used his pulpit to mock the \u201ccorrupt\u201d media for its focus on coronavirus infections. \u201cYou turn on the news: \u2018Covid, Covid\u2019 You know when they\u2019re going to stop talking about it so much? 4 November,\u201d Trump said. Later in the week, Mike Pence stumped in central Wisconsin, just outside Wausau \u2013 the metro area that on Thursday represented the nation\u2019s eighth highest outbreak relative to its population, according to the New York Times. Cases in the Wausau area ballooned after Trump made the same stop in September. USA Today suggested the jump could be related to last month\u2019s event, though there isn\u2019t evidence to tie the rise to the event specifically \u2013 a link that would be especially difficult to make, given the fact that the volume of cases has far exceeded the county\u2019s capacity to conduct contact tracing. \u201cWe have not been able to effectively contact trace in the past two months or more,\u201d said Judy Burrows, spokesperson for Marathon County\u2019s public health department. Remington concedes that the rallies themselves pose a risk, but said he\u2019s more concerned about the message Trump supporters take away from the fact they\u2019re held at all. \u201cIn the grand scheme of things, the risk of these events themselves pale in comparison to what they represent philosophically \u2013 a top-down refusal to comply with public health guidance,\u201d said Remington. Katie Rosenberg, Wausau\u2019s mayor, said she\u2019s been saddened to see the way the pandemic has divided the community between those who have listened to advice from medical experts and those who \u201cflat out deny\u201d the guidance and refuse to wear masks or physically distance. \u201cWausau has historically been a pretty purple area, but right now it feels almost as if we have two different worlds. It\u2019s unfortunate that we\u2019re approaching public health along political lines, but that\u2019s where we\u2019re at as a country,\u201d Rosenberg said. The divisiveness playing out at the state level has spilled over into the way the area has responded to the pandemic, she said, with its conservative-leaning county board pressuring the local health department not to introduce measures that are seen as too radical. Faced with inaction from a state legislature that Rosenberg said has \u201ctaken the past seven months off,\u201d the Wausau city council will next week look at issuing a city-wide mask order, though she\u2019s concerned that attempts to enforce it could strain local police resources. \u201cI know that there are people here who care about each other as a community, so it\u2019s confounding to me that we\u2019ve gotten to this place where we\u2019ve forgotten our responsibility to keep each other safe,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
