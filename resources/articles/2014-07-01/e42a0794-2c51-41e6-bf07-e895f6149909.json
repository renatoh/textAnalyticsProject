Hamas said it was \"studying\" the proposal. \u2022 Heavy Israeli bombardment increased the Palestinian death toll to 223, including four boys, aged 9-11, killed by a beach shelling witnessed by the Guardian. Rocket attacks on Israel continued, for which Hamas claimed credit. \u2022 Hamas officially rejected the Egyptian-proposed ceasefire and demanded changes to it. Representatives of Palestine, Hamas and Israel met or planned to meet in Cairo for talks. \u2022 Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu said Hamas \"shut the door\" on diplomacy and bears responsibility for civilian deaths in Gaza. Rifts within his government grew, as his foreign minister split his party from Netanyahu's and called for occupation of Gaza. \u2022 A UN agency declared a state of emergency for the whole of Gaza and 22,000 people sought refuge in schools. The UNRWA said Gaza's health system is on the brink of collapse, with reported cases of viral meningitis. \u2022 Israel warned 100,000 Gazans to leave their homes, and authorized calling up an additiona 8,000 reserve soldiers, raising fears of a ground operation. The Gaza interior ministry and a hospital were struck in blasts. The Israeli military warned some Gazans not to return home after the brief ceasefire window. President Obama says the US will use \"all our diplomatic resources and relationships to support efforts of closing a deal on a ceasefire\" between Israel and Gaza. Before remarking on new sanctions on Russia over the ongoing crisis in east Ukraine, the president commented on the crisis in Gaza, saying \"we continue to support diplomatic efforts to end the violence between Israel and Hamas.\" \"Israel has a right to defend itself from rocket attacks that terrorize the Israeli people. There's no country on earth [that wouldn't respond].\" Obama also said he's \"heartbroken by the deaths of innocent civilians \u2026 of men, women and children in Gaza \u2026 and that's why we've been working toward a ceasefire.\" \"Israel accepted a ceasefire \u2026 unfortunately, Hamas continued to fire rockets at civilians, thereby prolonging the conflict.\" He said the US continues to support Egypt's efforts to mediate, and urged restraint: \"We stress the continued need to protect civilians in Gaza and Israel.\" Obama also said he was \"proud that the Iron Dome system has saved many Israeli lives\". \"We're living death,\" a father of two in Gaza tells Reuters, which reports on the ambivalence and increasing despair in the Palestinian territories targeted by Israeli strikes. \"Israel has put us under siege for eight years, and the whole time we never felt we weren't at war. People here have been left with nothing, so what more do we have to lose now?\" \"Our situation is impossible to describe. It must end,\" said Abu Hashem. \"Israel knows a truce with no meaning is rejected by us, so now it feels it has a reason to hit us even harder.\" Reuters goes on to report that half of Gaza's 1.8 million people require UN food aid, electricity cuts out for hours each day, and \"salty, often contaminated water\" often flows from taps. A vegetable seller in Gaza City told Reuters that Israel \"respects no agreements and breaks any deal to serve its own interests. Anything it does for us, it has to be forced. \"We've seen them attack us and stop a hundred times and things still get worse. We're beyond tired, we're dead.\" You can read the full piece here. In line with reports earlier in the day, the BBC confirms that a major Israeli representative will head to Cairo for Gaza talks. White House press secretary Josh Earnest said earlier today that \"it's not in anybody's interests, in the Israelis' interests or the Palestinians' interest, for this exchange of hostilities to continue.\" Paris police forbid pro-Palestinian protesters from holding a march today, AP reports, after small groups tried to storm two synagogues earlier this week. France has western Europe's largest Muslim and Jewish populations, and unrest in the Middle East sometimes translates into tensions between the communities. After several thousand pro-Palestinian demonstrators marched peacefully Sunday through Paris, clashes broke out among small groups, including some who attacked synagogues. Several demonstrations have been held in recent days, and another was planned for Paris on Saturday. A police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday said that authorities will ban it because of \"the serious risk of disruption of public order that such a protest could engender, in a context of heightened tension\". Social media mirrors the bitter conflict between Israel and Hamas, the Guardian's Harriet Sherwood writes: Each side has taken to Twitter, Facebook and YouTube to denounce the other, and to present accounts that are at best partial and often blatantly distorted. The propaganda war between Israel and the Palestinians is not new, but this battle-round is being fought with unprecedented ferocity. And like the asymmetry in the military conflict, the strength and resources of the Israel social media troops outweigh those of Hamas and other Palestinian organisations. In recent years Israel has recruited hundreds of students to assist in its hasbara, or public diplomacy campaign. These individuals \u2013 some of whom are paid \u2013 act openly and covertly, many engaging in below-the-line online discussion threads to promote Israel's interests. At the start of the current conflict in Gaza students at the Interdisciplinary Centre, a private college in Herzliya, launched a social media campaign on Twitter and Facebook, \"Israel Under Fire\". On the other side of the conflict, Hamas and other Palestinian organisations have used social media in the propaganda war. Hamas' military wing, al-Qassam, has increased its Twitter activity, posting in Arabic, English and Hebrew and using graphic and distressing pictures of injured children, funerals and the destruction of homes. It uses language such as \"genocidal aggression\", \"resistance\" and \"martyrs\", which may seem strong to westerners but is part of the daily discourse among Palestinians. Hamas has also hacked Israeli television channels and Domino's Pizza's Facebook page to warn Israelis about its military intentions. You can read the full piece here. Hamas is \"studying\" the UN proposal, spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri told AFP, reporting on the ceasefire that Israel has accepted. UN special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, Robert Serry, earlier told Israel's Channel Two: \"I will also call on Hamas and other militant factions to reciprocate, stop firing rockets and respect the humanitarian pause.\" \"It is in the interest of all the citizens of Gaza, in order to give them a chance to go to the hospital, get health care or get food.\" Hamas said it was considering the request. \"Hamas has been informed about the UN proposal for a truce of several hours tomorrow,\" Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri told AFP. \"The proposal is being studied and when a decision has been taken it will be announced officially in a statement.\" The IDF also warns of repercussions should rocket fire continue. The Israeli military will cease hostilities tomorrow from 10am-3pm IDT, but Hamas has not yet responded to the UN initiative to allow for medical and relief aid in Gaza. The IDF has warned residents of Zeitoun, Beit Lahyia and Shuja'iya not to return to their homes after 3pm IDT. *A typo in this post originally stated \"10am-5pm IDT \"\u2013 we apologize for the error. Secretary of state John Kerry says the US is doing \"everything in our power\" to end violence between Israel and Hamas, AFP reports. \"Our concern is to have a legitimate ceasefire and see if we can find a way to stop the conflict and killing so we can get to the real issues that are underlying it,\" Kerry told reporters as he met his counterpart from Luxembourg. \"And we're doing everything in our power,\" said Kerry, adding that he has been speaking to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Arab officials. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki, meanwhile, said the US was not in a position to comment on or confirm details about civilian casualties in Gaza, only saying, \"The loss of lives for children and individuals in Gaza is horrific and is a tragedy, and that's why we're so focused on bringing an end to the violence.\" Hamas demands changes to Egypt's proposed ceasefire, a senior Palestinian official tells the AFP. Hamas deputy leader Mussa Abu Marzuq met Egyptian officials in Cairo and set out the changes being sought, said Azzam al-Ahmad, a senior figure in Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah movement. \"Hamas has rejected the proposal in its current form and demanded additions, like applying the 2012 agreement concerning border crossings with Israel, and demanded right for fishing up to 12 miles into the sea,\" Ahmad told reporters in Cairo. Senior Hamas official Ghazi Hamad told AFP in Gaza City that the Egyptian plan was rejected \"in its current form\" and that Hamas had notified Egypt of the changes it was seeking. \"The initiative should include clear wording on fully lifting the blockade on Gaza, including opening all the crossings and releasing the rearrested prisoners,\" Hamad said. AFP also reports that Hamas and other factions object to the term \"hostilities\", instead saying they are acting in \"self-defence and resisting the occupation\", and that \"what the occupation is doing is aggression\". Abbas met with Hamas leader Abu Marzuq and was due to meet Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukri and Arab League chief Nabil al-Arabi, as well as Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi The Israeli military says it is \"carefully investigating\" the deaths of four children on a beach in Gaza today, killed by two shells fired by Israeli forces. The IDF told the AFP in a statement: \"Based on preliminary results the target of this strike was Hamas terrorist operatives. The reported civilian casualties from this strike are a tragic outcome.\" According to ABC News correspondent Alexander Marquardt, the IDF says it \"has no intention of harming civilians dragged by Hamas into the reality of urban combat. A senior official has told Reuters that Israel has agreed to a hour \"cessation of hostilities in the Gaza Strip for humanitarian reasons\", to last five or six hours. The Reuters report continues: The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it had not yet been decided when the lull would take place. Hamas had no immediate comment. The appeal was made by a United Nations official, the official said, confirming Israeli media reports, shortly after Hamas rejected an Egyptian-proposed ceasefire to end the nine-day war in which 215 Palestinians and an Israeli have died. A summary of events so far today. \u2022 Heavy Israeli bombardment increased the Palestinian death toll to 215, including four boys, aged 9-11, killed by shelling on a beach. More than 1,600 have been injured, according to the Gaza health ministry. \u2022 Hamas officially rejected the Egyptian-proposed ceasefire, which crumbled on Tuesday after rocket fire continued from Gaza and Israel resumed attacks. \u2022 Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu said Hamas \"shut the door\" on diplomacy and bears responsibility for civilian deaths in Gaza. Rifts within his government grew, as his foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman, split his Yisrael Beiteinu party from Netanyahu's party and called for ground operations. \u2022 A UN relief agency has declared a state of emergency for the whole of Gaza after 22,000 sought refuge in school shelters. The UNRWA said Gaza's health system is on the brink of collapse, with reported cases of viral meningitis and 600,000 people facing safe water shortages. \u2022 Israel warned 100,000 Gazans to leave their homes, and Israel targeted the homes of four senior Hamas leaders. The interior ministry and a hospital were struck in blasts, and the IDF says more than 50 \"terrorist sites\" have been targeted Wednesday. \u2022 Hamas's armed wing claimed responsibility for more rocket attacks. One rocket attack damaged a school in Ashdod, one struck a home in Tel Aviv, and a third injured a soldier in southern Israel. The IDF said more than 60 rockets were fired so far Wednesday. \u2022 Talks continued in Cairo, as Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas met with representatives of Hamas and Egyptian mediators. The conflict intensified on Tuesday after a six-hour respite during which Israel had accepting an Egyptian proposal for a ceasefire, but rocket fire from Gaza continued. Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu made a \"secret\" telephone call to Egyptian president Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, at the weekend to discuss a possible ceasefire, write Harriet Sherwood and Orlando Crowcroft for the Guardian. Although Israel has warned that the deployment of troops and tanks is a real possibility, Netanyahu will have to calculate the potential gains against the increased risk of soldiers being killed and Israel being drawn into a long term reoccupation of Gaza. Hamas's rejection came as reports emerged of a \"secret\" telephone call between Netanyahu and the Egyptian president, Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, at the weekend to discuss a possible ceasefire. According to Haaretz, Tony Blair brokered the contact. About rifts within Netanyahu's government, such as his decision to fire deputy defense minister Danny Danon, they write: Divisions within the cabinet were mocked by Hamas, with spokesman Fauzi Barhoum calling the sacking of Danon a \"victory for the resistance\". Avigdor Lieberman, Israel's hawkish foreign minister, split his Yisrael Beiteinu party from Likud \u2013 dismantling a crucial alliance for Netanyahu \u2013 having accused the prime minister of hesitation over Gaza. Lieberman criticised the government \u2026 and called for an IDF ground assault and occupation of the Gaza Strip, saying: \"All this hesitation works against us. We must go all the way, there is no alternative. We have to end this conflict with the IDF in control of all of Gaza\" You can read the full piece here. The UN estimates 75% of Palestinian fatalities are civilians and more than 1,300 residential structures have been \"rendered uninhabitable\", by Israeli strikes, with 710 destroyed and an additional 660 severely damaged. With updated figures based on Tuesday reports, the UNRWA has released a report (pdf), which goes on to list thousands of people displaced, hundreds of thousands at risk of losing access to water, and the dozens of UN facilities damaged. Rolling reports from UN representatives, however, show that some of the figures are already outdated: some 22,000 people have been displaced, and 220 Palestinians have been killed. White House press secretary Josh Earnest has said the \"good faith willingness expressed by the Israelis to abide by the ceasefire should be sufficient encouragement [to Hamas] to stop firing rockets\". Earnest repeated the US support for Israel, saying \"Israeli don't just have the right they \u2026 have the responsibility\" to respond, but that the president urges both Israel and Palestinian factions to \"exercise concern for innocent civilians on both sides of the border\". \"[Civilians are] ultimately who would benefit most [from a ceasefire]. It's not in anybody's interests, in the Israelis' interests or the Palestinians' interest, for this exchange of hostilities to continue.\" With regard to ongoing ceasefire talks, Earnest gave no indication the US was involved, simply saying \"we'll have to see what leaders of Hamas [and other Palestinian groups]\" decide. AFP has published a video of leaflets drifting down en masse onto Gaza, as well as of interviews with Gazans ambivalent about Israel's messages to evacuate. One man asks \"Where should we go? There are around 50 people in the house. How can we we evacuate? Where can we go with six families?\" Another simply says \"It's better to die in our homes \u2026 Should we go to the schools? People are sitting on top of each other in there.\" Some 22,000 Gazans have fled to UN shelters, according to UNRWA spokesperson Chris Gunness. The health crisis in Gaza may soon be exacerbated by crippling shortages of safe water, as the UN fears. Basman Alashi has meanwhile told the Equal Times about problems at al-Wafa hospital, which was hit by an air strike blast earlier Wednesday. From the report: \u201cTwo weeks before the war we felt the shortage of medications from the market,\u201d said Basman Alashi, 57, who is the director of the al-Wafa orthopaedic hospital, also in Gaza. \u201cWe have supplies of medications for two weeks more. After we will have to ask the United Nations Relief and Works Agency or the World Health Organisation to supply us.\" Alashi noted the hospital needs 127 listed medicines which are currently banned from import. Today 80% of Palestinians in Gaza receive food aid. In the past year alone, prices have increased 300%, according to a recent report. Like his fellow employees at al-Shifa, Dr Sheikh hasn\u2019t been paid in two months. Yet he has worked around the clock in recent weeks, even sleeping at the hospital. \u201cWe are doing are best. We cannot compromise, but we need support,\u201d he said. A rocket fired from Gaza has struck a school in Ashdod, Israel, but there are no reported injuries. Seven rockets were fired toward the city, with four intercepted. According to Haaretz, four rockets have exploded outside towns near the Eshkol Regional Council in the past few hours, an area that has had heavy mortar fire. Air strikes and bombardment have picked up significantly in Gaza in the past two hours. The Gaza health ministry spokesman reports 220 dead and close to 1,600 wounded. Journalist Ben White quotes an earlier post with specifics from the ministry. NGO Save the Children has released a statement saying \"one out of every five people killed in Gaza \u2026 is a child\", and has called for a long-term agreement between Israel and Palestinian factions. As of now 213 Palestinians have been killed, including at least 42 children. \"Everyone knows why this conflict is wrong,\" said Save the Children's co-country director David Hassell. \"The use of explosive weapons in built up residential areas, targeting of homes, and indiscriminate rocket attacks place children in harm\u2019s way. \u2026 It is unacceptable that in a conflict between adults, children should make up a fifth of the victims.\" At least 149 of 194 people killed in Gaza have been civilians, 38 of whom were children. The numbers of dead, injured and displaced are increasing, as are the numbers of homes destroyed. Children and families in southern Israel are also terrified by the hundreds of rockets that have landed in Israel and one Israeli is reported to have been killed and at least 15 injured, including children. Beyond a ceasefire, we also know that only a negotiated agreement between all parties to the conflict will bring about a lasting difference: this must tackle the long-term causes of this conflict and promote dignity and security for both Israelis and Palestinians. ABC News producer Nasser Atta makes a similar point about the toll of intermittent war. The Israeli left and anti-war protesters are struggling to be heard, Orlando Crowcrowft (@ocrowcroft) reports for the Guardian from Tel Aviv. The leafy park in Tel Aviv's Sderot, with cafes dotting intersections and a street bustling with joggers and dog-walkers, is a striking contrast with the other side of Israel's war \u2013 destroyed buildings and grieving families in Gaza . But Nir Kalfen, who served in the Israeli Defence Forces for three years during the second intifada, says \"Everyone has something to say about what we are doing wrong. But they are not hearing the sirens, running to the shelters or looking after their kids when they wake up shouting in the night.\" \"I give up. I don't read the newspapers any more, I don't care about any of it.\" Alon Lee-Green, 26, who has attended numerous protests, tells the Guardian: \"The problem is that on the one hand we are not allowed by the army to gather more than 500 people together when there are missiles and sirens, but on the other we also feel a bit lost over [whether] we call a big crowd of people together while there is a danger of an alarm.\" On the beachfront near Tel Aviv's Allenby Street, a 67-year-old ex-soldier sitting drinking Corona says Israel is ready to make peace but does not have a partner in the Palestinians. Until it does, says the man, who declines to give his name, the war is likely to continue. \"The problem with these groups \u2013 Hamas, Hezbollah \u2013 is that they say they want peace but what they really want is to push us into the sea,\" he says. \"You give them Gaza and tomorrow they will be asking for Jaffa.\" You can read the full piece here. A senior IDF official has told journalists in a briefing that chances of a ground invasion are \"very high\", the New York Times reports. He said an Israeli takeover of Gaza is \u201cnot a huge challenge\u201d, estimating it would take \u201ca matter of days or weeks\u201d, but that preventing a more dangerous devolution in the coastal enclave would require an occupation \u201cof many months\u201d. \u201cEvery day that passes makes the possibility more evident,\u201d the official told a handful of international journalists in a briefing at the military\u2019s Tel Aviv headquarters. \u201cWe can hurt them very hard from the air but not get rid of them.\u201d He spoke on the condition of anonymity under military protocol. ABC News producer Nasser Atta makes a similar point working from the obverse perspective of civilians' interests. A spokesperson for the prime minister's office told the Times he couldn't comment, and that it was \"a professional opinion of the military\". Hamas spokesperson Sami Abu Zuhri has that vowed the group will continue launching attacks, AP reports. Zuhri said Hamas feels \"alone in the field\", with little support from the Arab world. He called on Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, of the rival Fatah faction in the West Bank, to support Hamas' refusal of an Egyptian cease-fire deal. Abbas is in Cairo and has reportedly met with Hamas leader Musa Abu Marzuk to discuss potential ceasefire with Israel. Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu blames Hamas for civilian deaths following Israeli strikes, saying \"Hamas shut the door to a diplomatic solution and it therefore bears the sole responsibility \u2026 for civilian deaths.\" The statement comes after a meeting with Italian foreign minister Federica Mogherini, and Netanyahu asked Italians to \"imagine that your cities of Rome, Florence and Milan were rocketed indiscriminately by a terrorist group.\" Many world leaders \u2026 understand our battle against Hamas terrorists, who are seeking to fire rockets on our cities. They killed an Israeli citizen yesterday, but they\u2019re targeting millions of our citizens, directly targeting them with rocket fire which is a war crime, and also using their own civilians as human shields \u2013 another war crime. We\u2019ve been trying to find a solution to this problem. Yesterday I accepted the Egyptian ceasefire proposal. This was a proposal that was endorsed by the UN Secretary General and by the Arab League. Israel accepted the ceasefire, Hamas rejected it. We held our fire for six hours, and during that time Hamas continue to barrage our cities with rockets. Hamas thus shut the door to a diplomatic solution and it therefore bears the sole responsibility for the continuation of the violence. It\u2019s responsible for the civilian deaths, the innocent deaths of Palestinians that it uses as human shields, and it\u2019s responsible for the deaths of Israeli civilians and the terror rocketing of Israeli civilians. I believe that all members of the international community should unequivocally support Israel\u2019s right to defend itself. None of the countries that I know would adopt a different position \u2026 Israel will continue to do so until peace and quiet are restored. This is our right; this is our duty; we will act by it. Italy has one advantage over us. It has sea from three sides. But imagine that your cities of Rome, Florence and Milan were rocketed indiscriminately by a terrorist group next to you. You wouldn\u2019t accept it. And you\u2019d fight back. And that\u2019s what Israel is doing.We\u2019re fighting back. Those who are firing at us are not seeking a political solution. Those who are firing at us are seeking the disappearance of Israel, the destruction of Israel. And so for them we have one answer: we will fight you and we will defeat you. \u2026 I think that the most important thing vis-\u00e0-vis Gaza is to ensure that Gaza is demilitarized from rockets and from the attack tunnels that Hamas is seeking, is building into Israel. This is an important part of the long-term solution but in the immediate moment, Israel has to take the actions to defend its citizens as any normal country would against terrorists who are committing double war crimes of targeting civilians and hiding behind civilians. His office posted his statement on Facebook. Lebanon has arrested two Palestinian brothers on suspicion of helping to fire rockets at Israel, AFP reports. Two Palestinian brothers suspected of involvement in rocket attacks on northern Israel have been arrested by the Lebanese army, the military said on Wednesday. \"Khalil and Hassan Kharraz were arrested on Tuesday. They admitted to transporting rockets on 13 and 14 July to the area from where they were launched\" at Israel, the army said in a statement. Between July 11 and 14, during the ongoing war between Israel and Gaza, run by the Palestinian movement Hamas, at least nine rockets have been fired from south Lebanon towards the Jewish state. The Israeli army has retaliated by firing scores of shells at Lebanese territory. The Guardian's Peter Beaumont (@petersbeaumont) has an update from Shifa hospital, where the injured from a beach shelling that killed four children have been taken. He says three hit by the attack who made it to the hospital have died, and four still survive. A summary of the key events so far today. \u2022 Hamas officially rejected the Egyptian-proposed ceasefire,which crumbled on Tuesday after rocket fire continued from Gaza and Israel resumed attacks. Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said: \"The outcome of discussions \u2026 was to reject the proposal\". \u2022 Heavy Israeli bombardment increased the Palestinian death toll to 215, including four boys, aged 9-11, killed by shelling on a beach. More than 1,600 have been injured, according to the Gaza health ministry. \u2022 Israel warned 100,000 Gazans to leave their homes. In a statement, the Israel military said: \"Messages are being conveyed to residents of Beit Lahyia, Shuja'iya and Zeitoun, in the northern Gaza Strip, requesting them to evacuate their homes for they own safety and stressing the IDF's efforts to avoid harming civilians.\" \u2022 Israel targeted the homes of four senior Hamas leaders, as well as the interior ministry, which it said was being used to coordinate rockets launched against Israel. The IDF says more than 50 \"terrorist sites\" have been targeted Wednesday. \u2022 Hamas's armed wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, claimed responsibility for more rocket attacks. One rocket attack damaged a home in Tel Aviv while another injured a soldier in southern Israel. Israel said more than 60 rockets were fired so far Wednesday. \u2022 Israeli prime minster Binyamin Netanyahu was criticised by several senior ministers over the crisis. Public criticism from his own ranks resulted in the sacking on Tuesday night of deputy defence minister Danny Danon, a member of Netanyahu's own Likud party. \u2022 Halting talks are set to continue in Cairo between Palestinian president, Hamas and mediating representatives.The conflict intensified on Tuesday after a six-hour respite during which Israel had accepting an Egyptian proposal for a ceasefire, but rocket fire from Gaza continued. \u2022 A UN relief agency has declared a state of emergency for the whole of Gaza after almost 18,000 sought refuge in its schools. The UNRWA said Gaza's health system is on the brink of collapse, with several reported cases of viral meningitis and crumbling infrastructure. The IDF has announced it will investigate the killing of four children on a Gaza beach, report Haaretz and ABC News correspondent Alexander Marquardt. Haaretz also reports rocket alarm sirens sounding in the Eshkol Regional Council and Asheklon and its surrounding regions. Spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri has reiterated Hamas' rejection of the Egyptian ceasefire initiative, saying \"We have been clear that we did not approve it. Hamas will not accept any ceasefire that does not work to Palestinians' advantage. Journalist Khaled Abu Toameh quotes a Hamas leader in Lebanon, Osama Hamdan, as making a similar remark with regard to the group's attitude toward Monday's proposal. Channel Four News' Jonathan Miller is following the funeral of the four boys killed in the Gaza Port strike. A funeral procession is under way for the four boys killed in the Gaza port strike. Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri, has made a statement on al-Aqsa TV, saying that 43 children have been killed in Gaza in the past 10 days, and mentioning the port strike. Abu Zuhri says that Hamas: \"demands that [Palestinian president Mahmoud] Abbas adopt and respect what the resistance has to say, as well as the people of Gaza. We are deeply disappointed by the official positions of Arab regimes toward war in the Gaza Strip. We are besieged.\" He says \"the Israeli occupation will pay the price for its crimes against our people.\" Peter Beaumont has written an account of the strike that killed four children, which he witnessed near a Gaza beach, and after which he and other journalists tried to help wounded children and the man with them. Behind the smoke, I see four figures running, silhouettes whose legs are pumping raggedly. From their size it is clear they are a man and three young boys. Only afterwards do we discover there are four others who are dead, all children, lying on the wall. I am shown a picture of one of the dead boys, his skin scorched and bruised. Their names are released later: Ahed Bakr, aged 10; Zakaria, 10; and two other boys from the Bakr family, both named Mohammad, aged 11 and nine. The second shell catches the survivors as they reach the brightly coloured tents. As it explodes, my colleagues, now standing by the terrace wall, shout at unseen Israeli gunners who can't hear them: \"They are only children.\" The children are brought up. Pulling up the T-shirt of the first boy, who looks about eight years old, we find a shrapnel hole, small and round as a pencil head, where he has been hit in the chest over the second rib. The boy cries in pain as we clean and dress the wound, wrapping a field dressing around his chest, pressing to staunch the bleeding. He winces in pain, and he is clearly embarrassed too as a colleague checks his shorts to look for unseen femoral bleeding. A waiter grabs a table cloth to use as a stretcher, but a photographer takes the boy in his arms to carry him to the ambulance that has arrived. In less than 10 minutes it is over. Even the smoke on the pier has died away, save for a last few drifting wisps. You can read it in full here. The Israeli cabinet has approved drafting an additional 8,000 reserve soldiers, Israel Radio reports, confirming previous reports. \"Gaza's a place at the moment where it's very easy to bleed to death,\" the Guardian's Peter Beaumont (@petersbeaumont) tells my colleague Amanda Holpuch, who's just spoken to him by phone. Beaumont just administered first aid to a child injured by shelling that killed four children in Gaza City. By the south wall we heard a very loud explosion, and thinking it was either some kind of naval gunfire or more artillery, where you see fisherman and their children often getting their stuff ready. \"We see this billowing brown smoke and very, very quickly we realize there are people running through the smoke. We didn't know then that four of the children \u2013 they're all part of a family called the al-Bakr family \u2013 they came running down. And as I'm standing looking down on this wall, kind of a little place that people go down on weekends. \"While I'm standing down looking toward this wall \u2026 there's an adult and three children were turning the corner at the beach waving at us, kind of trying to say \"Can we come to the beach, will you help us?\" \u2013 they got hit by a second artillery round. By the time they made it, the adult, a man of about thirty, clearly had a stump \u2026 from shrapnel. \"The three boys got brought up to the terrace where we work and fortunately we had some medical kits, and we very quickly went to work on the two kids who'd been injured. A child brought in, about eight I guess, eight or nine, got a shrapnel wound to the chest, as the other'd been injured in the arm and the head, and we gave first aid while the ambulances came. \"We were worried at first that the hole in his chest might spill through into his lung. We wanted to stop the bleeding but also to try and make sure he was all right until the ambulance came. So some other colleagues helped his brother or cousin I guess, with the head injury.\" The Israeli cabinet may call up an additional 8,000 reserve soldiers, according to reports from security analyst Danny Nisman and Channel Two News' Udi Segal. Israel has already approved calling up 30,000 reservists since the conflict began over a week ago. A Hamas official representing the Fatah movement has arrived in Cairo, where Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas in Cairo for talks with Egyptians, AFP reports. \"A meeting will be held this afternoon between an official from Hamas and a representative of the Egyptian leadership,\" said Azzam al-Ahmad, a senior member of the Fatah movement. Ahmad said he hoped the talks in Cairo would \"crystalize a definite formula for an Egyptian initiative\" or clarify its plan, which had proposed an end to hostilities from 0600 GMT on Tuesday. Abbas is due to arrive in Cairo later Wednesday for talks. French journalist Emilie Baujard has snapped as shot of two \"low intensity missiles fired just now in front of [her] hotel\" in Gaza. Baujard tweeted about an hour ago that children were playing on the beach before a shells struck their location. NBC foreign correspondent Ayman Mohyeldin says he was playing soccer with the boys minutes before the strike. As Israel tallies more than 1,200 rockets fired into the country over eight days, its own strikes on Gaza have mounted, now totalling at more than 1,825. The Gaza health ministry has added the names of the four children just killed by a gunboat shell to its Facebook page. At least 16 people have died today in Gaza, and the total number of Palestinians killed is now 213, per emergency services. The ministry says 1,565 have been injured. AFP reports: \"All four were on the beach when the attack took place, according to AFP correspondents who witnessed the attack from a nearby hotel. Several injured children took refuge at the hotel, they added.\" The IDF reports having struck \"50 terror sites across Gaza\" so far today, with air strikes continuing. According to the statement the targets have included tunnels, Hamas infrastructure, \"centers of terrorist activity\", and firing sites. The Gaza interior ministry has been struck, as has the Al-Wafa rehabilitation hospital, where AFP reports a panicked staff and Channel Four's Jonathan Miller missile debris and crumbling walls. Four children have been hit by Israeli shelling at a fishing area in Gaza, journalists report. A gunboat fired at the beach, hitting a fisherman's family. Peter Beaumont, the Guardian's Jerusalem correspondent, witnessed the attack and tried to administer first aid. His report will follow shortly. Channel Four's Jonathan Miller has graphic images of the children, who hospital officials say were killed after bombing struck a Gaza City beach. Here's a summary of where things stand: Hamas officially rejected the Egyptian-proposed ceasefire, which crumbled on Tuesday after rocket fire continued from Gaza and Israel resumed attacks. Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said: \"The outcome of discussions within the internal institutions of the movement was to reject the proposal\". Israel warned 100,000 Gazans to leave their homes, fuelling fears that its assault on Palestinian territories will swell. In a statement the Israel military said: \"Messages are being conveyed to the residents of Beit Lahyia, Shuja'iya and Zeitoun, in the northern Gaza Strip, requesting them to evacuate their homes for they own safety and stressing the IDF's efforts to avoid harming civilians.\" Israel targeted the homes of four senior Hamas leaders. It also hit Gaza's interior ministry, which it said was being used to coordinate rockets launched against Israel. Hamas's armed wing, the al-Qassam brigades, has claimed responsibility for more rocket attacks on Israel. One rocket attack damaged a home in Tel Aviv while another injured a soldier in southern Israel. Israel said more than 60 rockets were fired so far Wednesday. The number of Palestinians killed in the eight-day offensive against Gaza has increased to 209, according to Gaza's health ministry. At least two hospitals were hit, and the majority are civilians. One Israeli civilian was killed Tuesday. The Israeli prime minster, Binyamin Netanyahu, has been criticised from several of his most senior ministers for his handling of the crisis in Gaza. Public criticism from his own ranks resulted in the sacking on Tuesday night of deputy defence minister Danny Danon, a member of Netanyahu's own Likud party. The military conflict intensified on Tuesday following a six-hour respite in which Israel halted its aerial bombardment of the coastal enclave, accepting an Egyptian proposal for a ceasefire. Hamas rejected the plan, continuing its rocket fire throughout the day and killing an Israeli citizen at the Erez border crossing, the first Israeli fatality of the conflict. A UN relief agency has declared a state of emergency for the whole Gaza after almost 18,000 sought refuge in its schools. The UNRWA said Gaza's health system is on the brink of collapse with several reported cases of viral meningitis as well as hundreds of injuries from the bombardment. Hamas and Islamic Jihad have submitted a list of 10 ambitious demands to Egypt for the establishment of a 10-year truce with Israel, according to Ma'an news agency citing the the Hebrew-language daily Maariv. The demands are: The withdrawal of Israeli military tanks from the border fence area to a distance that enables Gaza farmers to access their fields and tend them freely. Freeing all Palestinian prisoners detained after the abduction and killing of three Israeli teenagers in the southern West Bank including those who were freed as part of Gilad Shalit prisoner swap. This precondition also includes softening procedures against all prisoners in Israeli custody. An end to the siege on the coastal enclave and the reopening of all border crossings. The opening of Gaza's international seaport under UN monitoring. An increase in Gaza fishing zone to 10 nautical miles and an increase in the size of permissible fishing boats. International monitoring of the Rafah crossing into Egypt. Closing Gaza airspace to Israeli aircraft. Permission to Gaza resident to be allowed to visit Jerusalem and pray in the al-Aqsa Mosque. No interference in Palestinian internal affairs including political arrangements and the reconciliation agreement and all its consequences. Re-establishment of the Gaza industrial zone. More on Hamas's rejection of the Egyptian-proposed ceasefire, from Reuters. It quoute spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri as saying: The outcome of discussions within the internal institutions of the movement was to reject the proposal and therefore, Hamas informed Egypt last night it apologises for not accepting it. Hamas's armed wing had already spurned the Egyptian plan on Tuesday. Hamas has officially informed Egypt that it has rejected its failed ceasefire initiative, according to a snap from Reuters. The Israeli military is maintaining its running tally of the number of rockets fired from Gaza. Earlier it said 61 rockets had been fired on Wednesday, including 23 intercepted by Iron Dome. One of the recent to have landed narrowly missed a house in Ashkelon, according to police spokesman Micy Rosenfeld. AFP has more on air strikes against the al-Wa'afa rehabilitation hospital near Gaza City. Shortly after it was hit on Tuesday night the Israeli army contacted the hospital three times, saying everyone should be evacuated by morning as the air force was planning to intensify its air strikes. Director Basman Alashi explained that the 14 patients in the facility, many of them paralysed or in a coma, are in no position to be moved. And even if they were, he said, there is no place to take them. \"There is no place safe in Gaza! If a hospital is not safe, where is? \"We cannot leave our patients, they are helpless. They cannot move, they cannot walk, they cannot eat, they cannot even scratch their heads by themselves,\" he said. Even as he spoke, the sound of shelling rattled the hospital windows. Mercifully, said staff doctor Hassan Sarsur, many of the patients are unconscious and unaware of what is happening. But for others, the situation is terrifying. \"Several of our female patients are paralysed but conscious, and during the night they were crying with fear and clutching our hands,\" Sarsur said. Aya Abdeen, one of eight women in the facility, is paralysed from the waist down because of a tumour in her spinal cord. \"Yesterday, when they said that we have to evacuate and with all the shelling, of course I was afraid,\" she told AFP. \"There was shelling all around and the hospital was shaking. And I am as you see, I can't move,\" she said. \"We are sick people, in a hospital!\" Doctors at the hospital have reached out to international agencies in a bid to secure Israeli assurances that the facility won't be hit again. And a group of foreign activists are staying at the hospital in the hope that their presence might deter further attacks. \"The Israelis told the (international) agencies that the hospital was not the target, only the area around it. But they have already hit us directly,\" Sarsur said. \"We are helpless, the war comes to us and there is nothing we can do to stop it.\" Dr Medhat Abbas, director general of Gaza health ministry, confirmed that hospitals and medical facilities are being targeted by Israeli bombardment. In an interview with the Guardian, he said Gaza's health system was overwhelmed with more than 1,500 people wounded in the bombardment, as they struggle with inadequate supplies, and power and fuel shortage. He also pleaded with the international community to pressure and Egypt and Israel to open the borders to Gaza. He said: There is no safe place in the Gaza strip for civilians to hide. There are no shelters, they have targeted hospitals, streets, domestic areas randomly. Two hospitals have been hit. The European Gaza hospital and the Wa\u2019afa medical rehabilitation hospital. And they [the Israelis] have targeted a rehabilitation institute. They killed three disabled persons inside and wounded another three. At the same time the Wa\u2019afa medical rehabilitation hospital is threatened to be attacked once again. They have asked the staff and the disabled patients living inside to evacuate. They have targeted the fourth floor and attacked this hospital four or five times yesterday. They are planning to demolish a full hospital of five stories. These are crimes. These are violations of human rights. Dr Abbas complained that the Rafah crossing into Egypt had only been partially opened. We hope that the border will be opened, because you have to have the free mobility of patients across the border and health professional. Why are two million people trapped in this prison in Gaza? Why? They have left the people without hope. Everybody in Gaza dreams to have a ceasefire. Everybody dreams to live in peace. We are peace lovers in Gaza we are not blood suckers. He said people in Gaza were being left to die. If you plan to travel it may take one year and you may not succeed. It is not Fatah and Hamas, it is not political. Everybody living in the Gaza strip today is suffering. Israeli experts are predicting overland raids to destroy Hamas's command bunkers and tunnels, Reuters reports. \"The direction now is to continue air strikes and, if need be, enter with ground forces in a tactical, measured manner,\" an Israeli official said after the security cabinet met overnight. The Israelis blew up a cross-border tunnel last week which, they say, may have been just one of many that Hamas has dug for deadly infiltration raids on their southern towns. While tunnel-hunting incursions would be far short of a full-scale invasion and reoccupation, there is still the danger for Israel that risky and time-consuming missions could fall to Palestinian ambushes. Hamas leaders have talked up their \"tunnel campaign\" against the Israeli enemy. One publicity video showed Palestinian fighters hauling rockets through a narrow passage to load onto a launcher that appears buried in an orchard. It is then fired remotely after its mechanised cover slides open. Media reports on the Israeli military suggest it has just one dedicated tunnel-hunting unit, codenamed \"Ferrets\" - potentially no more than a few dozen commandos equipped with breathing apparatus, attack dogs and scouting robots. Detecting the underground network is a problem for Israel - as shown by the continued rocket salvoes from Gaza despite its intensive, intelligence-guided air strikes on suspected sites. Geologist Yossi Langotsky, a retired army colonel and Defence Ministry adviser, said on Army Radio that Israel had failed to develop technologies to \"hear\" hidden digs, allowing completion of the secret passages that now await activation. Amos Yadlin, a former commander of Israeli military intelligence, said a crackdown on the tunnels was pressing, calling them \"the second-most serious threat after the long-range rockets - or the primary threat, according to some\". Dozens of UN schools and more than 20 health buildings have been damaged in the ongoing offensive against Gaza, according to Chris Gunness, spokesman for the UNRWA. As Ben White notes Israel claimed that damage to the Wa'afa hospital was caused by shrapnel, not helicopter missiles as Channel 4 News Jonathan Miller reported from the scene. Here's a summary of the latest developments: Israel has warned 100,000 Gazans to leave their homes fuelling fears that its assault on the Palestinian enclave is set to increase. In a statement the Israel military said: \"Messages are being conveyed to the residents of Beit Lahyia, Shuja'iya and Zeitoun, in the northern Gaza Strip, requesting them to evacuate their homes for they own safety and stressing the IDF's efforts to avoid harming civilians.\" Israel targeted the homes of four senior Hamas leaders. It also hit Gaza's interior ministry which it said was being used to coordinate rockets launched against Israel. Hamas's armed wing, the al-Qassam brigades, has claimed responsibility for more rocket attacks on Israel. One rocket attack damaged a home in Tel Aviv while another injured a soldier in southern Israel. The number of Palestinians killed in the eight-day offensive against Gaza has increased to 208, according to Gaza's health ministry. A hospital was hit by helicopter fire after patients were ordered to leave. The Israeli prime minster, Binyamin Netanyahu, has been criticised from several of his most senior ministers for his handling of the crisis in Gaza. Public criticism from his own ranks resulted in the sacking on Tuesday night of deputy defence minister Danny Danon, a member of Netanyahu's own Likud party.

A UN relief agency has declared a state of emergency for the whole Gaza after almost 18,000 sought refuge in its schools. The UNRWA said Gaza's health system is on the brink of collapse with several reported cases of viral meningitis as well as hundreds of injuries from the bombardment. Hamas's armed wing the al-Qassam brigades has claimed responsibility for more rocket attacks on Israel. The IDF claims more rockets were intercepted by its Iron Dome system. At least one rocket is reported to have hit a house in Tel Aviv. One soldier was reported to have been injured by shrapnel in southern Israel. The homes of four senior Hamas leaders have been targeted, according to AP citing Gaza's interior ministry - which was itself hit. The website of the Gaza Interior Ministry said Israel warplanes carried out dozens of air strikes before dawn Wednesday, targeting 30 houses, including those of senior Hamas leaders Mahmoud Zahar, Jamila Shanti, Fathi Hamas and Ismail Ashkar. Zahar was a key figure in Hamas' violent takeover of Gaza in 2007, while the other three were members of the Palestinian parliament elected in 2006. Many Hamas leaders have gone into hiding since the beginning of the Israeli offensive. William Booth has surveyed the damage to the homes of Ismail Ashkar and Fathi Hamas. Reuters has a photo of damage to the home of Mahmoud Zahar, a co-founder of Hamas. Binyamin Netanyahu's cabinet is in disarray after the Israeli prime minister came under fire from several of his most senior ministers for his handling of the crisis in Gaza, writes Orlando Crowcroft in Tel Aviv. The storm of public criticism from his own ranks resulted in the sacking on Tuesday night of deputy defence minister Danny Danon, a member of Netanyahu's own Likud party. Danon had told media yesterday that Hamas had humiliated Israel by setting conditions for peace, after Netanyahu said he was willing to accept the Egyptian-brokered ceasefire. Hamas claimed that it had not been consulted over the ceasefire conditions and rejected it. \"At a time when \u2026 Israel and the IDF [Israel Defence Forces] are in the midst of a military campaign against the terrorist organizations and taking determined action to maintain the security of Israel's citizens, it cannot be that the deputy defence minister will sharply attack the leadership of the country regarding the campaign,\" Netanyahu said in a statement Tuesday night. \"These sharp remarks on the deputy defence minister's part are irresponsible, especially given his position. They also serve the Hamas terrorist organization as a tool to attack the government with.\" The divisions within the Israeli cabinet have been mocked by Hamas, with spokesman Fauzi Barhoum calling the Danon sacking a \"victory for the resistance\". Confirmation that Gaza's ministry of interior was hit overnight, from William Booth of the Washington Post. Israel said the building was a legitimate target because it was being used to direct rocket fire. It said: Such apparatus are deeply involved in the organization's militant operations, and many of its facilities are utilized to store weaponry and ammunition, launch rockets at Israel, and supervise terror attacks and other militant activities. The number of Palestinians killed in the eight-day offensive against Gaza has increased to 208, according to Gaza's health ministry. Is spokesman, Ashraf al-Qudra, named all 208 victims on his Facebook page. He said the most recent victim was 10 years old. Gaza city resident Jehad Saftani, a photographer working for the Institute for Middle East Understanding, describes the almost constant bombardment. Speaking by telephone he told the Guardian: Every minute we can hear a bomb. I saw now pillars of smoke up from the east of Gaza city. Last night was a terrible night, there were many airstrikes on different targets. They bombed an apartment in the tower next to me. They bombed everywhere. I feel my head would explode. There is no place to go. They [the Israelis] tell all the people in the east of Gaza city and the north of Gaza to come to the middle, because they want to complete their operation. This map shows the areas where Gaza residents have been ordered to flee. Channel 4 News's Jonathan Miller says the Wa'afa hospital was hit by an Israeli helicopter attack. Pro-Palestinian activists are staging a protest at the Wa'afa geriatric hospital after its patients were ordered to leave as part of Israel's bombardment warning. They include Swedish activists Fred Ekblad. Sweden's English language website, the Local, quoted him saying: Just now they called back and told us to leave the building immediately. It's possible, likely even, that the Israelis don't want to attack the building. But it could be that they want to use it in a potential ground operation. Ekblad's Twitter feed reported intensive shelling getting closer. The IDF has released a map of the areas of Gaza where residents are being urged to leave. Heavy shelling is reported in Beit Lahiya one of the areas warned. Reuters intermittent live feed of the Gaza skyline is currently working. Israeli air attacks in Gaza have targeted civilian structures and killed civilians in violation of the laws of war, according to Human Rights Watch. It investigated four Israeli strikes during the current offensive that resulted in civilian casualties. It found that they either did not attack a legitimate military target or attacked despite the likelihood of civilian casualties being disproportionate to the military gain. It said: \"Such attacks committed deliberately or recklessly constitute war crimes under the laws of war applicable to all parties. In these cases, the Israeli military has presented no information to show that it was attacking lawful military objectives or acted to minimize civilian casualties.\" Sarah Leah Whitson, HRW Middle East director, said: Israel\u2019s rhetoric is all about precision attacks but attacks with no military target and many civilian deaths can hardly be considered precise. Recent documented cases in Gaza sadly fit Israel\u2019s long record of unlawful airstrikes with high civilian casualties. HRW also urged Palestinian armed groups to end indiscriminate rocket attacks on civilian centres. Channel 4 News' Jonathan Miller has more on the Gaza rehabilitation hospital where patients were order to leave. Patients have been moved to the ground floor after it was hit by an Israeli raid, he reports. More Gaza-launched rockets have been intercepted over Tel Aviv, Haaretz reports. Tel Aviv resident and human rights campaigner Elizabeth Tsurkov described the attack and its aftermath. Journalist Gregg Carlstrom reports hearing the sound of rockets being intercepted. Israel is accusing Hamas of using citizens as human shields by instructing them to ignore warnings to flee. Ofir Gendelman, a spokesman for prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu, tweeted: \"Hamas uses Gazans to protect its rockets\". The patients of a rehabilitation hospital, are among those who have been ordered to leave Gaza, by the Israeli military, writes Peter Beaumont in Gaza. But the hospital's director, Basman Ashi, said everyone would remain and that foreign volunteers had arrived to serve as human shields. Hamas's ministry of the interior has told residents to ignore the warning, calling it \"psychological warfare\". The American satarist Jon Stewart asked where Gazans were supposed to go when they recieve warnings to flee. In his show on Monday he asked: \"Evacuate to where? Have you fucking seen Gaza? Israel blocked this border, Egypt blocked this border. What are you supposed to swim for it?\" Stewart also highlighted the asymmetric nature of the conflict by contrasting Israel's Iron Dome and smart phone apps to protect Israelis from Gaza rockets, with the warning bombings or \"amuse booms\" sent to Gazans. Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas is due to travel to Egypt and Turkey in search of regional support for an immediate end to the fighting after Tuesday's truce attempt collapsed. Abbas was due to arrive in Cairo on Wednesday evening where he was expected to meet top Egyptian officials over fresh efforts to seek a ceasefire, and was expected to head to Turkey a day later, officials told AFP. Abbas, who reached an agreement with Hamas in April that led to the formation of a unity government last month, called for acceptance of the ceasefire proposal. The Arab League also welcomed the cease-fire plan. A message from our moderators: We have opened this live blog to comments for discussion of today's events in Israel and Palestine.

The Israeli military has confirmed that it hit 39 \"terror targets\" in Gaza overnight including the ministry of interior. It claimed the building was a legitimate target as part of \"operation protective edge\" as it was being used to direct continuing rocket fire from Gaza. The IDF said: The Hamas Ministry of Interior is responsible for overseeing and directing Hamas armed mechanism, excluding its militant wing. Such apparatus are deeply involved in the organization's militant operations, and many of its facilities are utilized to store weaponry and ammunition, launch rockets at Israel, and supervise terror attacks and other militant activities. The Israeli military has provided a translation of the warning flyers it has dropped over several areas of Gaza. One says: In spite of the ceasefire, Hamas and other terror organizations continued to fire rockets, therefore it is the intention of the IDF to carry out aerial strikes against terror sites and operatives in Shuja'iya and Zeitoun. A high volume of rocket fire at Israel has originated in this area. For your own safety, you are requested to vacate from your residence immediately and head towards Gaza City by Wednesday morning, July 16, 2014, at 0800am (0500 GMT). The IDF does not want to harm you, and your families. The evacuation is for your own safety. You should not return to the premises until further notice. Whoever disregards these instructions and fails to evacuate immediately, endangers their own lives, as well as those of their families. Welcome to our continuing coverage of the violence between Israel and Gaza. Here's a roundup of the latest developments: Israel has warned 100,000 Gazans to leave their homes fuelling fears that its assault on the Palestinian enclave is set to increase. In a statement the Israel military said: Messages are being conveyed to the residents of Beit Lahyia, Shuja'iya and Zeitoun, in the northern Gaza Strip, requesting them to evacuate their homes for they own safety and stressing the IDF's efforts to avoid harming civilians. An Israeli attack destroyed the house of Mahmoud Zahar - who is believed to be in hiding elsewhere - in the first apparent targeting of a top Hamas political leader. Elsewhere at least seven Palestinians were killed in the early hours of Wednesday, Gaza health officials said. The number of Palestinians killed now stands at 205. The military conflict intensified on Tuesday following a six-hour respite in which Israel halted its aerial bombardment of the coastal enclave after accepting an Egyptian proposal for a ceasefire. Hamas rejected the plan, continuing its rocket fire throughout the day and killing an Israeli citizen at the Erez border crossing, the first Israeli fatality of the conflict. A UN relief agency has declared a state of emergency for the whole Gaza after almost 18,000 sought refuge in its schools.
