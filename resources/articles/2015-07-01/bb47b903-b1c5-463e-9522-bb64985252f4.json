Speaking to Power 105.1 host Angie Martinez, who he invited to his mansion and yacht in Miami over the course of a two-day interview, the mogul said their current disputes are just \u201cbusiness\u201d. \u201cWayne is forever my son. I think that what\u2019s going on is just some business,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s my son and I love him to death. What\u2019s going on now I don\u2019t really know how it\u2019s going to turn out.\u201d The pair have been embroiled in a legal battle since January, when Lil Wayne filed a $51m lawsuit against Cash Money after his much anticipated Tha Carter V album failed to be released. Cash Money took legal action against Lil Wayne in July after his record Free Weezy Album appeared on Jay Z\u2019s streaming service Tidal, suing for $50m. The rapper told his fans on Twitter that his label was unwilling to release his album and that he was a \u201cprisoner\u201d. Those remarks surprised Birdman who told Martinez: \u201cThat was a shock for everybody. I never thought he\u2019d be saying something negative about me. For that man to open his mouth and say something negative about me \u2026 that affected my life.\u201d Lil Wayne reportedly wanted to take Drake and Nicki Minaj \u2013 arguably the two most high profile rappers operating today \u2013 with him, but Birdman poured cold water on that proposition. \u201cNicki and Drake ain\u2019t going nowhere,\u201d he told Martinez, who then asked if the pair were happy, to which Birdman said yes: \u201cBoth of them, very. I\u2019ve got much respect for them because they\u2019ve got much respect for Dwayne Carter and Bryan Williams. Regardless of what goes down with us, they ain\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d When Martinez quizzed him about the recent indictment that named Williams and rapper Young Thug as being involved in a plot to shoot Lil Wayne\u2019s tour bus in April, he said the accusations were farcical. \u201cIt\u2019s about the craziest shit I\u2019ve ever heard of my life,\u201d he said. \u201cYou crazy if you believe that. You know how I am about Wayne. I love him, he\u2019s my son.\u201d He added that he worries about Lil Wayne, after rumours of gang-related threats being made against him surfaced. \u201cAnybody who gets in this game knows it can get gangsta sometime, it can come to you or come around you. We in this shit and we got to be ready for it,\u201d he said. A full version of the exclusive interview is due to appear on Power 105.1\u2019s website later on Tuesday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
