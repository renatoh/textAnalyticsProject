A year ago, I would not have admitted that. A year ago, I would not have said a word. A year ago, I would have kept my head down and my mouth shut for fear of drawing unwanted attention to myself and the problems I was facing. In the back of my mind, I always hear the voice that says \"don\u2019t ever let anyone know you\u2019re doing it tough, because they will take your kids from you\". I don\u2019t live far from Lightning Ridge, a place where 41 children were removed from their Aboriginal parents. In some parts of the country, Aboriginal children are 10 times more likely to be put into care. As an Aboriginal mother, these numbers are horrifying. As an unemployed single Aboriginal mother, these numbers are terrifying. Neither of my children would have missed days at school (except if sick of course) had there been programs in place that would have helped me. A simple lunch program for disadvantaged kids. A school shoes payment plan for low income families. And on the odd occasion, a bus pick up for scorching hot or pouring rain days. Instead of addressing the problems that arise with poverty, the government has now put in place an initiative that employs truancy officers in Indigenous communities, at a cost of $24m. The feeling of a cold hand of fear on the back of my neck, always present, can only intensify. What happens if the small amount of work I have gained dries up and I am back in the position of money being so incredibly tight that the lack of it is suffocating? What if money again becomes so tight that shoes, uniforms, excursions, lunches or transport \u2013 issues that I don\u2019t have to worry about when I\u2019m working \u2013 become issues that keep my kids from turning up at school on occasion? What exactly is the scope of these truancy officers? Do they give my kids lunch? Buy them uniforms? Will my name be added to some department of community services list somewhere? Will there be a mark upon my name that gives rise to visits from people who can remove my children from my care? I spoke honestly and frankly with my mother about my worries. She was amazed that this is still happening, after all the trials Aboriginal women have been put through for generations. We spoke of her own mother's obsession with cleanliness, which sprang from her fear of the dreaded \"welfare man\", a government employee who could come to your house and demand to be let inside to ensure your house was clean, that there was adequate food available, that the children were going to school. She then went on to tell me about her own fears when she was raising me and my siblings: the absolute terror she felt when she had to collect food vouchers of some nameless person swooping in to take us kids off her because she was facing hardship after my father passed away. The tremble in her voice as she recounted this broke my heart. Aboriginal women have been told for the better part of two centuries that they are neglectful and not fit to raise children. Policy after policy, we have borne the brunt of racist and cruel initiatives enacted purely out of ignorance and the unwillingness of decision makers to listen to what Aboriginal women think is best for their very own children. There are broader issues at work here. I am seeing all the telltale signs of respectability politics at play. Politics that are othering black women, shaming them for their economic status and for the colour of their skin. Politics that point a damning finger at Aboriginal women who exist outside the margins of perceived respectability. Politics that cater to white conservative thought via the black men (and some black women) who hold up their hands in vehement agreement with policies that hurt black people immeasurably, instead of demanding equal rights and justice. In this race to the bottom they seek to integrate themselves with white conservative thinking and to hold themselves forth in a \"look at me, I\u2019m different, I\u2019m not like those black people, I think like you\" manner. It\u2019s revolting to watch. When the poor white woman across the road \u2013 in exactly the same boat I am and with the exact same monetary issues \u2013 does not have the extra burden and worry of people turning up on her doorstep to question her parenting, then that initiative walks like a racist duck, and quacks like a racist duck. The fear I carry and the aversion I feel towards governmental departments is due entirely to inter-generational trauma. My mother carries this fear, my grandmother carried this fear, my great-grandmother carried this fear. These fears are real \u2013 Australia's historical track record in this speaks for itself. As an Aboriginal mother, I have never been asked what I think would help school attendance rates. I have also never been asked what would be the absolute worst way to raise attendance rates. I will therefore say it here: when it comes to programs that affect Aboriginal mothers, I can be 95% sure that the government will go with the most invasive, detrimental and shaming plan. I absolutely abhor the idea of men making decisions that impact Aboriginal mothers, decisions that do nothing but enhance the culture of fear that we already live under. I am not for one second disputing the importance of children attending school. I do not know a single Aboriginal parent who does. But I do dispute the bullying tactics this government has employed in ensuring that attendance is met. The instilling of ever more fear into Aboriginal parents \u2013 this I dispute, with every fibre of my being. \u2022 A version of this article first appeared on the author's blog, cross-posted with permission"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
