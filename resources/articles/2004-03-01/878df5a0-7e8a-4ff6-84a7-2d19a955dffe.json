His jovial mood is such that even the attentions of the Inland Revenue have failed to throw him off his stride. Agassi has been told by the high court that he must pay \u00a327,000 [$49,500] of his endorsement earnings to the British government in taxes. \"What they're saying is that when I perform in England, because I wear Nike and I play with Head products, that these are revenue sources for me. In England I'm going to get a lot of TV time at Wimbledon and they figure they deserve a percentage,\" explained Agassi patiently. \"I have to play by the rules. I can't arbitrarily decide when I like something and when I don't. You pay taxes here, you're paying taxes there. I don't really begrudge them for it. It's a precedent they feel they need to set but it wouldn't stop me going there to play events. There's a lot of things I like about England.\" Agassi already has more in the bank than he will ever need and these days is clearly not playing for the prize money but for the chance to match his, as yet, undiminished skills with the best. He did that and more against the world No4 Guillermo Coria in the quarter-finals, beating the Argentinian 6-4, 7-5. His semi-final opponent, Roger Federer, is without doubt the finest player currently hitting a tennis ball and Agassi is clearly a fan of the 22-year-old. \"This guy has been playing spectacular tennis, especially this year,\" said Agassi. \"He can win a lot of slams because he can play different ways. That's what you need when you're playing in four different arenas around the world. Basically he just plays the game superbly.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
