The manager will secure the Scottish Premier League title should his side take a point at Kilmarnock on Saturday . If need be, he will have a further five games in which to complete the formalities. That is soothing, but Lennon has had little experience of the comfort zone in his time with the club. For the first time, he has spoken at length about the hazards and rewards in a new history of Celtic. Lennon appreciates the cafes and restaurants around Glasgow University but while a Celtic coach he was attacked there in September 2008 by a pair of Rangers fans who were subsequently jailed for two years. \"I was very lucky,\" he said. \"People told me that if I hadn't been as fit as I was at the time I could have been seriously damaged. I was unconscious and I don't remember much about it.\" Recently, another pair of Rangers supporters were found guilty of conspiring to assault Lennon and two prominent Celtic fans by addressing what seemed to be bombs to them, although the devices turned out not to be viable. There was a period, too, when Lennon was advised not to enter his own home unaccompanied in case an intruder was lying in wait. \"They were revamping the security system inside the house,\" he said. \"There were security guards walking me in. It was a bit of a distraction, but they just felt it was the right thing to do.\" Lennon finds it all too convenient that he should be treated as an ogre or as a person who cannot stop bringing havoc upon himself. This is supposed to be an extension of the role he once had as a defensive midfielder in the thick of most battles on the field. It is as if, in the public imagination, Lennon was born to live in the midst of trouble, but that interpretation is not a good fit for the broader facts. \"Everyone said that it is down to my aggressive style of play,\" he said, \"but then Paddy McCourt and Niall McGinn [two Celtic wingers] got sent bullets in the post and you wouldn't say they were aggressive types of players. They have the same background as me [Catholics from Northern Ireland]. People try and bury their heads in the sand sometimes and hide from the reality of it. They're just afraid to write about it.\" Lennon could not pretend to be a paragon. He was obliged last year to apologise to his board for a confrontation with Ally McCoist, then getting experience with Rangers as manager for the Scottish Cup ties, after a confrontation at the end of a win for Celtic. Still, a low profile would not suit him. \"All the other stuff should not be part of living in Glasgow,\" Lennon said. \"Why do I get so much abuse at every ground? My background plays a part. Maybe they just see me as a threat to their sort of happiness. In a perverse sort of way you take it as a backhanded compliment.\" He is also addicted to the sense of occasion at a ground where crowds of 50,000 are common for Celtic's SPL matches. \"We are not spoiled by the corporate side,\" Lennon argues, \"so there is still a raw energy. You go to some Premier league clubs and it's not at the decibel level you have with Celtic.\" Even so, the restricted income in a small country has to be deployed with as much care as possible. More effort is now applied to scouring the world for affordable talent. Victor Wanyama, a Kenya international, has the physicality for British football, but there is also plenty of potential to be tapped in a 20-year-old who cost a mere \u00a3900,000 from the Belgian club Beerschot. Lennon, despite the hostility he encounters, seems at peace while part of a project that absorbs him. At the end of last month, he was tweeting that he had the \"best job in the world\". Money does, of course, matter regardless of the odd bargain. Goals tend to be expensive. When Martin O'Neill's Celtic lineup beat Liverpool en route to the 2003 Uefa Cup final, two of their three goals in the tie came from Henrik Larsson and John Hartson. The Swede commanded extremely high wages and the Welshman had cost \u00a36m. Another striker, Chris Sutton, had been bought for a similar fee. For all the exploits, Celtic could not break even while paying such sums and the corresponding salaries. Lennon has done well as manager, but the challenge for him and his successors is steep.
