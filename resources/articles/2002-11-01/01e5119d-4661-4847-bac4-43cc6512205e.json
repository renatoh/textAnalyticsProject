Having tried and failed to invoke Fifa's four-day rule to prevent key players appearing for their clubs on Sunday, the Wales manager watched aghast as Robbie Savage became the seventh player to quit the original 25-man travelling party after straining his groin in Birmingham's goalless draw with Fulham. That withdrawal has raised eyebrows among the Welsh management, given the club v country furore whipped up over Savage's original inclusion, though Wales's doctors confirmed in Cardiff yesterday that the 28-year-old was unfit to play. The Swansea forward James Thomas joined Reading's Adrian Williams and the Wigan forward Neil Roberts in earning late call-ups. Officials arrived at Cardiff airport pushing what appeared to be build-your-own Ikea furniture on their trolleys. Rumours that they might be attempting to construct their own midfield proved unfounded, though they could be excused for trying. Apart from Savage, Everton's Mark Pembridge (calf) and the West Bromwich Albion pair Andy Johnson (gastroenteritis) and Jason Koumas (personal problems) are absent along with the forward Gareth Taylor of Burnley (concussion), Wolves' Nathan Blake (ankle) and the talismanic Newcastle striker Craig Bellamy (knee). At least Ryan Giggs, who needed two stitches in a head wound after Manchester United's 1-1 draw at West Ham, is fit and the Cardiff defender Danny Gabbidon has recovered sufficiently from back spasms to travel. Wales can go five points clear at the top of what once appeared a daunting group in the attempt to qualify for a major finals for the first time since 1958. Last month's victory over Italy gave their optimism a ring of truth; success against the group's whipping boys will labour the point. \"The preparation hasn't been ideal,\" said the captain Gary Speed, who may now move from left-back into central midfield, \"though we can't use that as an excuse. We've got to prepare right for it mentally and ensure there are no slip-ups. This is a huge game for us, even bigger than Italy. Things have changed and now everyone expects us to win. \"That's why we'll be taking this game as seriously as any I've ever played. It's a banana-skin tie but hopefully we'll see the banana skin before we trip on it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
