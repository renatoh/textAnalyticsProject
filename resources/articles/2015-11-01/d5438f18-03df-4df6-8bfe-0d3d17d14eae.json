Some found it self-indulgent and sluggish, others were gripped by the slow-burn and rapid reveal. And the Daily Mail thought there was \u201cno plot but lots of disco dancing!\u201d. It\u2019s fair to say episode two won\u2019t have changed many minds either way, but I don\u2019t mind getting lost down this particular rabbit hole. (I\u2019ll even forgive it Stand By Your Man.) The Alice in Wonderland allusions hinted at when Danny swallowed what turned out to be an encryption device became explicit once Clarke Peters\u2019 man of mystery had offered Danny a blue pill inside a red sweet. Curiouser and curiouser \u2026 \u2018You\u2019re friends with everyone but you know no one\u2019 \u2013 Danny Poor Danny is still in a state, breaking down in front of a sub-Homeland-style wall of news clippings and speculations on Alex\u2019s fate. His performance for the journalists was a bit of a disaster \u2013 all sincere supposition, no evidence \u2013 although I was intrigued that Michaela Coel\u2019s hack seemed more sympathetic. Did she and Danny already know each other? At least his instincts \u2013 \u201csomething akin to female intuition\u201d, reckoned Frances \u2013 are spot-on. The quick response in Alex\u2019s flat. Intuiting first that the staff weren\u2019t Alex\u2019s parents, and then which room was Alex\u2019s bedroom. He\u2019s probably better qualified to speculate on Alex\u2019s sexual proclivities (\u201cyour muscles can\u2019t lie\u201d) than cold fish Frances or a bunch of detectives who have never met him, no matter what the attic might have suggested. However much Danny\u2019s state of mind might be distorting what he thinks or sees (and, by extension, what we think and see), I\u2019m inclined to trust his sexual instincts completely. That said, there\u2019s clearly more to him. While I\u2019m not convinced he\u2019s a sleeper agent as some have speculated, I can\u2019t think why he would need a hiding place-cum-dead letter drop in a disused factory (via the back door of a cafe). Unless, of course, it was a spot used by Alex. I could decipher the following from the journal therein: \u201cI\u2019m falling and I can\u2019t turn back. I need a love to keep me warm and safe,\u201d and \u201cNon sense. The boys are too much to handle but what can you do when you\u2019re lonely.\u201d The scribblings of a lonely man, which both Alex and Danny were. And then there was the Clarke Peters postscript. I\u2019m assuming Paxton &amp; Grey is a not very discreet front for the CIA and that Peters (billed as \u201cthe American\u201d) is not a man to be trifled with. But what about the pill inside the sweet? I thought it might be cyanide, although perhaps the American sucked it to demonstrate to Danny that it wasn\u2019t harmful. Classic grist to the espionage mill, anyway. One thing\u2019s for sure: no one wants Danny to pursue the case and everyone is underestimating him. Frances underestimates his intelligence, Scottie his determination, the American his courage, Frances\u2019s chef-cum-maid his passion. By tearing up the American\u2019s business card, Danny has declared his intentions. Your move, spooks. \u2018He hates the name Alastair\u2019 \u2013 Alex Frances confirms Alex\u2019s genius (embellished by the PhD certificate and painstakingly constructed Ferris wheel in the staff house) and social disconnection, suggesting he regarded everything as an intellectual problem to be solved, whether that be an inclination for rough sex or a garden maze. She also claimed credit for giving him the drive and discipline to succeed, apparently regardless of his own wishes. By contrast, Danny\u2019s sticking to his story. Of course, it\u2019s possible that both of them could be right, to an extent. Spies specialise in secret lives, after all. Alex\u2019s second appearance, via the rather charming pen portrait of his relationship with Danny, could be misleading. It was clearly playing in Danny\u2019s head and could therefore simply be Danny rewriting the past and creating a story he wants/needs to believe \u2026 Finally: is Alex even dead? Everything would suggest so, except that, as several of you noted, we never actually saw his body. There was an eye, Danny\u2019s reaction and the words of the police. And note the above quote from the woman who wasn\u2019t his \u201cmum\u201d: he \u201chates\u201d rather than \u201chated\u201d. Slip of the tongue or something more significant? \u2018We weren\u2019t close.\u2019 \u2018Get as far away from these people as you can\u2019 \u2013 Mr and Mrs Turner Well, you can see why Alex might have a few issues. First, the fake family \u2013 David Hayman and Lorraine Ashbourne were a further glowing tribute to London Spy\u2019s casting team. Defiantly, almost stereotypically Presbyterian from decor to clingfilm-wrapped dinner, they clearly know far more than they\u2019re letting on, with \u201cmum\u201d seemingly desperate to talk and \u201cdad\u201d to do anything but. \u201cMum\u201d (sick, according to her husband) was perhaps the only one who really cared for Alex. That said, I noted they were called Mr and Mrs Turner in the credits. Could this suggest they really are Alex\u2019s parents, and perhaps gave him up to Frances and Charles to allow him a better chance in life? Or am I just being paranoid? As for the second pairing, what an introduction for Charlotte Rampling, imperious on a drawbridge somewhere outside London. She played Miss Havisham in a Beeb production of Great Expectations a few years back, and this place had shades of Satis House. A maze that felt like Chekhov\u2019s gun. Sepulchral gourmet dinners eaten by candlelight in silence. Sullen, watchful staff. Downton Abbey, this was not. Rampling was perfect: chilly, distant, dismissive and very pleased with herself. If Frances was as upset as she claimed, she was doing a fine job of hiding it. Numbness and disconnection may well be symptoms of grief, but these ran deep enough to feel pathological. Not sure what the deal was with silent, detached Charles (played by the appropriately named Nicolas Chagrin), although I think we\u2019ll be hearing more from him. I very much hope that\u2019s not the last we\u2019ll see of Rampling and Whishaw going toe to toe. This was delicious: no melodrama, just throbbing dramatic intensity. \u201cBefore you hold some sort of parade\u201d v \u201cWhen he told me you were dead, he wasn\u2019t lying\u201d? I\u2019m calling that a score draw. \u2018I am so fucking far from being part of the establishment\u2019 \u2013 Scottie At last, a little of the real Scottie: a depressed, briefly suicidal recovering alcoholic, quick to anger when wronged. Signing up for MI6 at Cambridge to avoid the rat race, he was entrapped in a post-Philby/Blunt/Burgess/Maclean \u201cfag hunt\u201d and shunted to the MoD and into celibacy. Or so he says. Danny certainly seemed convinced (the pat of the hand was genuinely touching) and he delivered the story sincerely enough. I still don\u2019t trust him, though. A part of me wonders whether he arranged Alex\u2019s murder out of jealousy \u2013 after all, as soon as he was aware that Alex and Danny were an item, Alex was bumped off. And, of course, he joined the chorus warning Danny off further investigation, albeit with Danny\u2019s safety in mind: \u201cOccasionally, it\u2019s right to be afraid\u201d is a hard argument to fault where the secret service is concerned, but \u201cit\u2019s just you alone\u201d effectively told Danny he\u2019s running out of friends. London The tube pursuit (if that\u2019s what it was) was a textbook spy-movie sequence, well-mounted and filmed in the paranoid style (the attention to detail extended to having one of Vauxhall\u2019s escalators out of order). It was also, by a margin, the most kinetic sequence of another hour of long silences and lengthy monologues. But most of the visual impact lay in the careful framing tonight \u2013 Hampstead Heath, the disused factory, Danny facing down MI6 HQ. The provincial detours were also creepily effective \u2013 Danny\u2019s night-time prowl around the staff quarters had me right on edge. Notes and observations Good spot from several of you that the lights weren\u2019t working in Alex\u2019s flat, yet the bulbs and bar-fire were lit. A production oversight, or evidence of a set-up? Some of you have wondered how warehouse worker Danny could afford his flat in Vauxhall \u2013 even Frances thinks he\u2019s got no money (hence her fears of extortion). Is he squatting? A dealer on the side? Being bankrolled by Scottie and/or his absent parents? I\u2019m pretty sure a tree on Hampstead Heath played a central role in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. In fact, that whole scene played out like respectful homage. Everyone\u2019s obsessed with sleep in this show. Alex was an insomniac, while each character seems to want to know where/when/how Danny will get some kip. Every house Danny visits, apart from perhaps Scottie\u2019s, feels so austere as to never have been lived in. Alex\u2019s flat, Alex\u2019s attic, the castle, the staff\u2019s house \u2013 you wouldn\u2019t call any of them homes. At least Danny\u2019s flat has a life to it. What, if anything, was in the jar marked \u201cfor guest use\u201d at the Turner staff house? And what would said house\u2019s TripAdvisor rating be? I\u2019m not buying Lester Freamon as a sinister puppetmaster. Not yet, anyway. I liked the way the MI6 building was like Sauron\u2019s eye as Danny tore up the American\u2019s card. The Daily Express, eh? And now based in the Blue Fin Building (real-life home of IPC/Time Warner), apparently. Still, nice to see the good old Independent Times didn\u2019t stoop to muckraking and manufacturing quotes. \u201cNo fuss is the best piece of advice you will ever hear.\u201d Cut to the three wise monkeys on the mantelpiece. Lovely. I genuinely thought David Hayman might try and bump Danny off when they went for a walk. \u201cJournalists make difficult bedfellows.\u201d True dat."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
