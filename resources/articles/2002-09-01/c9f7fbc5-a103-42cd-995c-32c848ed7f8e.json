In a speech to the Trades Union Congress in Blackpool, Ms Morris said the country could only have a strong economy if the workforce was given the right skills and training. \"We know that the socially inclusive society, the society that is central to all we both want, is hugely dependent upon getting education and skills right.,\" she said. She said she was \"hugely ambitious\" for Britain's education system following the 6% average spending increase announced in Gordon Brown's spending review. But she condemned the \"elitism\" of people who claimed that an improvement in exam results was only because standards have fallen. Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, described Ms Morris' speech as \"probably the most committed and passionate\" he had heard from her in a long time. \"Her emphasis on partnership and getting support into schools are crucial to relieving the pressure on teachers and making the profession more attractive. \"It is only through doing that [that] we will overcome the increasingly dangerous shortfall in young people coming into the profession. \"Partnership and support must go together if problems of the profession and our schools are to be eased.\" Eammon O'Kane, general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, added: NASUWT, added: \"The development of that partnership is crucial if the government's ambition to create a world-class education service is to be realised. \"The likely success of that partnership will be greatly enhanced if the present talks with the government on a new contract for teachers, accompanied by measures to reduce excessive workload, end in a positive resolution.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
