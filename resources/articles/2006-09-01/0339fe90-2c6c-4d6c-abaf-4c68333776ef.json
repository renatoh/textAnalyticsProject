Returning from his summer holiday in the Caribbean, Tony Blair, gives an interview to the Times in which he refuses to set a timetable for his departure, telling his party to 'stop obsessing'. Andrew Smith, the Brownite former Work and Pensions Secretary, warns: 'The leadership issue has to be sorted out sooner rather than later.' Sunday 3 September The clash of swords... Brownites reject calls for a Labour policy debate, with Ed Balls, writing in The Observer: 'The idea that we need a period of ... opposition or internal navel-gazing is absurd.' Alan Milburn and Stephen Byers demand Brown lays out his plans for government. Monday 4 September You've got mail... Up to 80 MPs are said to be willing to sign letters calling for Blair's resignation. One is coordinated by two once ardent Blairites, Sion Simon and Chris Bryant. Alan Johnson hints that he could stand against Brown. Monday 5 September The Blair Switch Project... The Mirror publishes a leaked memo showing how Labour loyalists are planning Blair's exit from No 10 with a 'farewell tour' including plans to appear on Blue Peter, Songs of Praise and Chris Evans's radio show. It says: 'He needs to go with the crowds wanting more. He should be the star who won't even play that last encore.' Wednesday 6 September It's war... The Sun reports that Blair has set 31 May 2007 as the date he will resign. Blair and Brown meet twice at Downing Street, for a total of three-and-a-half hours, culminating in allegations of blackmail from Blair and a ferocious shouting match. Junior defence minister Tom Watson, right, who signed one of the round robin letters calling for Blair to go, resigns; the PM calls him 'disloyal, discourteous and wrong'. Seven parliamentary private secretaries resign. Thursday 7 September When in a hole... On a trip to Seven Mills primary school in east London, Blair confirms that this month's Labour conference will be his last. He apologises to the nation for his party's internal feuding and admits: 'It has not been our finest hour.' Brown says: 'I, like others, have had questions. When I met the Prime Minister I said it is for him to decide. I will support him in the decision he takes.' Friday 8 September You stupid boy... Charles Clarke, the former Home Secretary, criticises Gordon Brown for smiling, above, as he drove away from Whitehall. 'A lot of people are very upset and cross about that,' he says. 'It was absolutely stupid, a stupid, stupid thing to do.' He adds that Brown must 'prove his fitness' to be PM. Brown makes a conciliatory call to Clarke and speaks to Blair in an attempt to limit the damage over the weekend. Saturday 9 September You stupid boy II... Clarke renews his attack in the Daily Telegraph, accusing Brown of having 'psychological issues' and being a 'control freak' and 'totally uncollegiate'. Rumours grow of a 'stop Gordon' campaign. Blair, addressing the think-tank Progress, warns that in-fighting 'turns the public off' ."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
