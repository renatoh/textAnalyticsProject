Investors, fearing the collapse of the eurozone, have pulled their money out of the financial system at vital moments, making it difficult for governments and businesses to meet the challenge of generating consistent growth. IMF director Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als said: \"Faltering confidence and policy uncertainty have led to a pullback of cross-border private capital flows from the periphery \u2013 quite an extraordinary phenomenon within a currency union.\" The IMF calculated that total assets of EU banks could be forced to shrink by as much as $2.8tn, leading to a 9% reduction in credit. In an extreme scenario that figure could climb to $4.5tn. The IMF said eurozone policymakers have tried to give money markets some certainty, but it has proved inadequate and is encouraging flights of money from the periphery to northern Europe and to countries outside the currency union. The stock market has risen strongly since the summer, but the IMF is concerned the market could deflate if confidence evaporates. The authors of the report, Peter Dattels and Matthew Jones, said confidence in politicians has waned as each economic initiative fails to unite policymakers. A failure to tackle key financial decisions in Washington and Tokyo is also blamed for the increase in instability, but the governments are deemed less of a threat than the eurozone and are given years rather than months to sort out their problems. \"Despite significant and continuing efforts of European policymakers, which have been essential in addressing investors' biggest fears, the principal risk remains the euro area crisis,\" Dattels and Jones said. \"Incremental policymaking has been insufficient to fully allay market tensions, despite the recent market rally since the end of July.\" They said problems in the US and Japan could be tackled over the next few months, and that it was a priority to agree a way forward for the eurozone. The Washington-based lender has warned before that the world economy is under threat from an unstable financial system, while eurozone leaders fail to agree terms for bailouts and monetary easing. European Central Bank boss Mario Draghi has garnered praise for his efforts to protect weaker eurozone countries in case they come under attack from nervous investors. Spain, Italy and Portugal have enjoyed lower interest rates as a result of ECB actions that cut borrowing costs. These moves have helped stave off a run on the currency. But Draghi has come under constant fire from politicians in Germany, Finland and Holland for creating unlimited rescue funds that could, they believe, rebound on the ECB. Earlier this week German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble said he believed Spain would survive without rescue funds from Brussels, contradicting most investor groups and City analysts who believe Spain can only survive if it accepts support from the EU. The IMF's global stability report argues that badly indebted countries need more support to alleviate the pressure from investors and create an environment that fosters confidence and growth. It says that while decisions are delayed, the assets held by banks also come under question and shareholders flee to hold safer assets. Banks in the eurozone periphery are known to hold billions of euros of bad debts that have yet to be recognised on their balance sheets. UK, French and German banks are also vulnerable to a downturn in the eurozone through their shareholdings and joint ventures with local banks in the periphery."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
