He said nations including Britain, France, Germany and the United States \u201chave been highlighting that this is not acceptable behaviour in the international community because they are all worried about China engaging in the same kinds of pressure tactics with them\u201d. Canada\u2019s relations with China soured after its arrest of Chinese Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on a US warrant last December. Nine days later, Beijing detained two Canadians \u2013 former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor \u2013 and accused them of espionage in a move widely viewed as retaliation. They are among a string of foreign nationals arrested in China and charged with espionage or attempting to steal state secrets. Trudeau added that \u201cwe need to figure out how to engage with them, but we also have to be clear-eyed about it, that China plays by a very different set of rules and principles than we do in the west\u201d. His comments may further inflame tensions between the two countries, which had appeared to be trying to move on from the row. This week both Beijing and Ottawa nominated new ambassadors, although a spokesman for the Chinese foreign minstry this week urged Canada to \u201creflect on its mistakes\u201d and immediately release Meng. \u201cAt present, China-Canada relations are facing serious difficulties,\u201d Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a daily briefing. Geng said China hopes the new Canadian envoy Dominic Barton can play an active role in returning ties to a \u201cnormal track\u201d. The previous Canadian ambassador, John McCallum, was fired in January after he said it would be \u201cgreat\u201d if the US dropped its extradition request for the Huawei executive. She is wanted by the US on fraud charges and is currently out on bail in Vancouver and living in her multimillion-dollar home awaiting extradition proceedings."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
