The allegations, made by the charity War on Want, also suggest that the government has failed to call these companies to account. The charges are made in Fanning the Flames, a report published to coincide with the opening of the Mines and Money World Congress in London this week. \"The British government has championed the cause of UK mining firms across the world,\" said Ruth Tanner, senior campaigns officer at War on Want. \"It is time for the British government to take action to stop these abuses.\" Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton are cited in the report. \"Rio Tinto earned $122m (\u00a361m) from its stake in the Grasberg gold and copper mine in West Papua, Indonesia, where local people have suffered years of serious human rights and environmental abuse,\" according to War on Want.\" A spokesperson for Rio Tinto said: \"We take human rights allegations seriously regardless of whether they relate to either managed or non-managed Rio Tinto operations. There are many complex economic, social and environmental matters associated with mining ... We are satisfied that our principles and standards are setting new benchmarks for responsible mining practices.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
