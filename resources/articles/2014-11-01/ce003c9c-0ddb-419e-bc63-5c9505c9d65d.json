The long-winded but brutal response he received from the White House on Monday seems to have been anything but that. It was clear, at least, that Hagel was being sacked, but it was death by platitude: a showering of public praise designed to make it as hard as possible for outsiders to discern precisely what he had done wrong. \u201cChuck has been an exemplary defense secretary,\u201d said Obama in an awkward White House departure ceremony. \u201cHe is somebody who has served ably and he is somebody in whom the president has the highest respect,\u201d added the press secretary, Josh Earnest, in a public briefing for reporters. But behind the scenes, senior administration officials did nothing to counter rumours of a more troubling explanation. Hagel was forced out because his job of winding down US military engagement in the Middle East was rapidly becoming one of winding it back up again. \u201cThe priorities of the department, or at least of the new secretary, have changed given changes in the international community,\u201d said Earnest in one of his more candid explanations. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that Secretary Hagel hasn\u2019t done an excellent job of managing these crises as they have cropped up but it does mean that as we consider the remaining two years of the president\u2019s time in office that another secretary might be better suited to meet those challenges.\u201d Privately, one official confirmed that Hagel\u2019s departure was all \u201cabout the politics\u201d of national security during the final phase of the Obama presidency. Susan Rice, the national security adviser, was the recipient of Hagel\u2019s memo criticising the Syria strategy last month and appears to have been behind the ousting. \u201cIt\u2019s about the kind of NSC team they\u2019re looking to build under Susan Rice during the final two years,\u201d said the official. Rice and other advisers on the NSC see themselves increasingly out of step with Hagel on a host of issues, from Syria and troop readiness to the size of the defense budget during a war against Islamic State militants that all sides now see as lasting for years. What their alternative strategy might look like is rather less clear, however. Hagel\u2019s memo had criticised the failure to challenge Bashar al-Assad in Syria, which he warned was encouraging moderate US allies in the country to side with Isis forces instead. Yet Rice has long been thought reluctant to be dragged further into the Syrian war by opening a second front with Assad. During the dawn of his tenure at the Pentagon, so was Hagel. Pentagon leaders have also repeatedly warned that a successful fight against Isis in both Iraq and Syria may ultimately require US combat troops, something Obama has steadfastly opposed. Hagel and the joint chiefs chairman, General Martin Dempsey, during several rounds of congressional testimony, have portrayed that opposition as less than airtight. Dempsey, in hailing Hagel\u2019s departure, said that the outgoing defense chief\u2019s \u201cinsight into the nature of military service was both rare and welcome\u201d. Republicans on Capitol Hill were quick to brand Rice and the White House as the culprits in Hagel\u2019s downfall. John McCain, the incoming Senate armed services committee leader, praised his estranged friend and blasted \u201cexcessive micro-management\u201d from the White House hobbling Hagel and his predecessors Leon Panetta and Robert Gates. The House armed services committee chair, Buck McKeon, a California Republican who is retiring, said the \u201cexcellent\u201d Hagel had the \u201ccards stacked against him\u201d as Pentagon leader, thanks to an \u201cunderfunded Defense Department, growing threats and intrusive White House micromanagement\u201d. McKeon\u2019s replacement, the Texas Republican Mac Thornberry, said the next defense secretary needed to be someone \u201cstrong enough to stand up against\u201d the White House. Whoever does take the job faces a tricky path between a confrontational Senate confirmation hearing process and a White House seemingly not entirely clear what it wants. \u201c[Obama and Hagel] arrived together at the determination that new leadership should take over at the Pentagon,\u201d insisted its spokesman on Monday. Whether Obama\u2019s fourth defense secretary can find his or her own consensus with the president remains to be seen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
