It has five differentiated games comprising a set of hierarchical activities designed to help less able pupils. The program is self-correcting and records the time taken to complete each activity. It reinforces the \"look, say, cover, write, check\" method of learning spellings. Children use it best for 10-20 minute sessions and can access it unsupervised. It has strong curriculum links and supports both the literacy hour and other relevant lessons. Written activities are needed away from the computer as a follow-up.
