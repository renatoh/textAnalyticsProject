Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. House to see Mueller evidence in justice department shift The House judiciary committee will soon receive underlying evidence from Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation, a breakthrough in the standoff between Democrats and the justice department. The deal was announced on Monday, shortly before the former White House counsel John Dean \u2013 a star witness in the Watergate investigation \u2013 told the committee he saw parallels between the scandal that ended the Nixon presidency and the Mueller report, which he called a \u201croad map\u201d for investigating Donald Trump. \u2018Principled person.\u2019 Mueller was in many ways the perfect man to lead the Russia inquiry: principled, trusted and precise. But, asks Tom McCarthy, did his principles make Mueller exactly the wrong person to defend and disseminate its findings? Kim\u2019s assassinated half-brother \u2018was a CIA informant\u2019 Kim Jong-nam, the exiled half brother of North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, was a CIA informant who had travelled to Malaysia to meet a contact from the US intelligence agency when he was assassinated at Kuala Lumpur airport in February 2017, the Wall Street Journal has reported. The newspaper said on Monday that, according to an unnamed \u201cperson knowledgeable about the matter\u201d, there was a \u201cnexus\u201d between the CIA and Kim Jong-nam \u2013 who was once considered the favourite to succeed his father, Kim Jong-il. Execution sites. A Seoul-based human rights group says it has identified hundreds of sites used for public executions in North Korea as part of an arbitrary death penalty programme to intimidate citizens. Hong Kong businesses vow to strike over extradition bill Dozens of businesses in Hong Kong have threatened to go on strike over a proposed law that would allow extradition to mainland China, opening the door for Beijing to pursue its political opponents. The plan has generated the biggest protests seen in Hong Kong since it was returned to China in 1997, with crowds of more than a million demanding the territory\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, withdraw the bill, which critics fear could harm Hong Kong\u2019s reputation as a safe hub for business. Strike threat. More than 100 businesses have declared plans to strike on Wednesday, including restaurants, retailers, beauty parlours, yoga studios and an adult entertainment store. Steve Bannon could return for Trump 2020 campaign Steve Bannon, the controversial populist who was Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign manager, could return to a similar role for the 2020 election, according to a new book. Bannon was exiled from Trump\u2019s inner circle last year after critical remarks about the US president were quoted in Michael Wolff\u2019s book Fire &amp; Fury. But in an interview for The Best People by Alexander Nazaryan, Trump reportedly \u201calmost welcomed\u201d the idea of his former White House strategist returning to the fold. Flattering words. Nazaryan quotes Trump as saying: \u201cNobody says anything better about me right now than Bannon \u2026 I will say this. Bannon, there is nobody that has been more respectful of the job I\u2019m doing than Steve Bannon.\u201d Crib sheet Doctors in Sudan say paramilitaries carried out at least 70 rapes during their attack on a protest camp in the country\u2019s capital, Khartoum, last week, in which more than 100 people were killed. Up to 100,000 travellers are thought to have had personal data stolen in a cyber attack on a US Customs and Border Protection subcontractor, raising fresh concerns about the security of facial recognition and federal surveillance systems. The US envoy on religious liberty, Sam Brownback, has said he is \u201cdisappointed\u201d by the lack of response of governments in the Islamic world \u2013 including Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Egypt \u2013 to China\u2019s persecution of its Uighur Muslim population. The Vatican has weighed into the debate on gender ideology, publishing an educational document titled \u201cMale and female he created them,\u201d to help Catholic school teachers counter ideas that \u201cdeny the natural difference between a man and a woman\u201d. Must-reads Michelle Wolf: \u2018I don\u2019t think about people liking me\u2019 The comedian Michelle Wolf is best known for her controversial routine at last year\u2019s White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner. But she won\u2019t be making any more Trump jokes, she tells Alexis Soloski. \u201cAll that guy wants is for people to talk about him, whether it\u2019s positive or negative, so I try to not give him that.\u201d The clothes that have lasted decades Lally MacBeth found her mother\u2019s old dress in a vintage store. Paul Peppiatt has a pair of 28-year-old socks. With shoppers growing tired of fast fashion and its cheap, disposable wardrobe-fillers, Sirin Kale talks to six people about the items they\u2019ve worn for decades. John Wayne\u2019s True Grit turns 50 1969 was a big year for westerns, boasting revisionist takes such as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and The Wild Bunch. But, as Scott Tobias writes, it was also the year that the defiantly traditional True Grit finally yielded an Oscar for the genre\u2019s most enduring star. The electricity price rises leaving South Africans in the dark After the ANC came to power in 1994, millions of South Africans were at last hooked up to the electricity grid. But the national utility, plagued by corruption and mismanagement, has raised prices so high that the lights are going out again, as Kimon de Greef reports. Opinion The billionaire Michael Bloomberg has pledged $500m to help the US become carbon neutral. Better than spending it on a presidential campaign, says Kate Aronoff \u2013 but the best thing for the planet would be if billionaires did not exist at all. For every Michael Bloomberg there are dozens of Koch Brothers and Rebekah Mercers, who\u2019ve poured tens of millions of dollars into spreading climate denial and blocking de-carbonization efforts at the local, state and national level.
