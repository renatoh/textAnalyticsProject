Predicting a physical contest after his team stunned Wolves on Sunday in the first leg at Carrow Road, Worthington said: \"What we need is a strong referee who is prepared to stamp his authority on anything that might be going on, on and off the ball.\" If the play-offs were a verbal contest Worthington would have the game won already, adding that his players could not afford to get \"sucked into anything\" as the teams battle for a place in the play-off final on May 12. \"But I'm confident my players will conduct themselves in the right manner,\" he said. Despite Norwich's two-goal lead, Worthington claims that Wolves have the upper hand. \"We're not favourites,\" he said. \"Wolves are the ones with the big-money signings, paying the big wages. We're in a nice position but we've got to go out and work very hard to get a result.\" Wolves, who led the First Division by six points in February, see things differently for \"the biggest match in our contemporary history\", as their chief executive Jez Moxey put it. \"Anything could happen if we score an early goal. This is not over yet by any means and we're looking forward to the game. Having said that, we accept we are now the underdogs,\" he said. \"So much is at stake. You only have to look at the ITV Digital situation to know how important it all is, with the Sky money, the commercial potential and even the parachute payments for teams who come down from the Premiership. This has to be the biggest match in our contemporary history. \"We have had a good look at what this club are all about with the full houses we've had this season and I know Molineux will come to life tomorrow night.\" Wimbledon's goalkeeping coach Stuart Murdoch will take charge of the team until a replacement is found for Terry Burton, who was sacked last week. Murdoch filled in for four weeks recently while Burton was in hospital. \"I had an interesting meeting with the chairman and I'm in temporary charge until such time as they appoint a new manager,\" Murdoch said. \"They have nobody lined up and they will wait until the play-offs have ended before making an appointment. \"It will be difficult without Terry because we will be expecting to see him coming round the corner all the time. He will be sadly missed.\" Nottingham Forest's captain Riccardo Scimeca, who has 12 months left on his contract, has told the manager Paul Hart that he wants to stay at the City Ground, after reports that the club may try to offload him this summer. Scimeca said: \"I will wait for them to approach me but I would be happy to stay because I have really enjoyed this season's football.\" \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
