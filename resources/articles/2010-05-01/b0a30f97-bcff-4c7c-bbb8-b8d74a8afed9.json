Which is a bonus, because it means that even weeks away from kick-off the entertainment has already begun. Indeed, this ball got rolling years ago. Somehow, the World Cup provokes a kind of lyrical insanity in everyone involved. At any other time, handballs are just handballs and people you don't like very much are told to \"get lost\" (or other simple words to that effect). Around this time every four years, it's suddenly the Hand of God and \"stick it up your bollocks\". Nothing associated with the tournament is immune to this disease. Thus when Adidas introduced their tournament ball it was not simply \"spherical\" but \"an energetic unit combined with perfect roundness\". Its colours were not chosen because they \"look nice\" but to \"represent the 11 players in every team, the 11 official languages of South Africa and the 11 South African tribes that make the country one of the most ethnologically diverse on the African continent\". It takes a rare and special event to provoke the use of the phrase \"ethnologically diverse\" in a football-related press release, and this is it. Fifa's World Cup poster has a vibrant yellow background. It would usually be sufficient to describe the chosen colour simply as \"bright\", \"quite pretty\" or \"frankly a little garish\" but here it \"symbolises the sun as the source of warmth, energy and life\". No professional is more susceptible to World Cupitis than the architect. It no longer appears enough for stadiums to have four sides and fit lots of people. Indeed, in 2002 it seemed that a firm grounding in popular mythology and local fauna was at least as important as a basic grasp of engineering in the design process. Miyagi got a ground modelled on a 16th-century Samurai helmet. A flock of avian-inspired stadiums included one based on the wings of the snowy egret, another in the image of a swan preparing for flight and a third, in Ulsan, which was supposed to look like a crouching crane. So far as I can tell, the only way of finding a crane that looks anything like it would be to chop one up and put it back together in the shape of a football stadium. Elsewhere in South Korea, architects produced designs that referenced kites, serving trays, ships' sails, fishing nets, the ancient Hwaseong Fortress, chariots used in a local variant of tug-of-war and a gayageum zither, a 12-stringed folk instrument. Although the Allianz Arena in Munich was promisingly nicknamed the schlauchboot, or dinghy, most grounds in Germany four years ago appeared to have been designed with little more than efficiency in mind. But South Africa represents an emphatic return to form. So Polokwane's stadium resembles the baobab tree (well, it has some round \"trunks\" in the corners), while Durban's is \"inspired by the South African flag itself\". Nelspruit boasts \"Africa's wildest stadium\", with orange roof supports that resemble giraffes and black and white seats arranged in zebra stripes. In Port Elizabeth, at the end of the famous Garden Route, there's a petal-inspired covering \u2013 a garden roof, perhaps. But the jewel in the crown is Soccer City in Johannesburg, which apparently looks like a calabash \u2013 a hollowed-out pumpkin traditionally used to carry water \u2013 resting above a ring of fire, and has an exterior that borrows \"colours and textures from the natural landscape of South Africa\" and \"inspiration from the randomness of the stars in the Johannesburg night sky\". There seems to be a kind of national puzzlement that Fifa appears underwhelmed by England's 2018 World Cup bid, but clearly we are not giving them what they like. The vast majority of our stadiums already exist, and make no attempt to reflect local interests. Perhaps if Villa Park, positioned just off the M6, had its roof remodelled to resemble a traffic cone and a long swoop of stationary traffic, Sepp Blatter might look more kindly upon us. The key to our success could be to build a Robin Hood-themed ground in Nottingham, to reference the Beatles at Anfield or to construct a brand new stadium in Wigan shaped like a meat pie and further embellished by a giant sculpture by Antony Gormley that will become known as the Potato of the North. But for now this World Cup must be our focus, and I am pleased that my own preparations are all but done. In other words, my home is equipped with an object that symbolises the soft embrace of a loving parent at the dawn of life, another that quietly represents the season that dominates so much of our national discourse, and a third that displays every shade and colour and in so doing reflects the social and cultural diversity of the entire tournament. A sofa, a fridge and a telly, as I would call them at any other time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
