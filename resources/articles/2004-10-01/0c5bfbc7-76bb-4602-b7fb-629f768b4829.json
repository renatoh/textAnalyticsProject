The grocery chain is the regular target of takeover talk because of its falling share price and loss of profitability, features that make some City experts believe it might be best turned around outside the arena of the stock market. Mr Magan, who in the 80s founded the boutique bank Hambro Magan, which was later sold to NatWest, is reported to have laid out his plan to the unnamed chairman of a FTSE 100 company with a view to that executive chairing the supermarket chain. In response to the report, Mr Magan said: \"Like many other investment bankers, no doubt, I have undertaken a preliminary review of Sainsbury's but the weekend press has exaggerated my current involvement with the situation. \"I evaluate on a continuous basis all sorts of investment opportunities and, in particular, review situations which are currently in the public domain.\" He is also reported to have discussed his idea with Sainsbury's outgoing finance director, Roger Matthews, although it is thought this is unlikely, given Mr Matthews' public pronouncements about seeking a role in the sporting world. Mr Magan is involved in a number of venture capital firms, including Lion Capital Advisers, Rhone Group and Carlton Corporate Finance. Marks &amp; Spencer, another retailer struggling to regain glory, may also be the subject of takeover rumours after it was reported that Brandes, a secretive US fund management group, visited the company's management last week during a rare trip to London."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
