It has rarely featured in their own upbringings. It has never been thought to be the glamorous end of the education department. And anyway, to paraphrase that Tory election poster question: how hard is it to keep a few hundred colleges - not forgetting several dozen quangos - running smoothly? Much harder than it might look. Most of these colleges are only now discovering that they are getting much less cash from the exchequer than they had anticipated. This will only fuel their concerted campaign to press the government to close the gap between the funding level for school sixth forms and for 16- to 19-year-old students in colleges. It will also stoke up the further education workforce's long-running demand for restoration of pay parity with school teachers. Staff in at least 11 colleges are voting on taking strike action against colleges that have refused to implement the terms of a pay deal, agreed two years ago, between the lecturers' union Natfhe and the Association of Colleges. And thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of adults are soon going to find out that the courses they hoped to start this autumn are not going to be running. But colleges form only part of the brief, which has become more sprawling and disparate with the plethora of new quangos, initiatives and targets that have sprouted under Labour. Finding out exactly what the duties are is a task in itself. In the four years that he held the further education portfolio in the last parliament, Ivan Lewis successively boasted four job titles, with various combinations of the words \"learning\", \"adult\", \"young\" and \"skills\", which attempted to cover his responsibilities. Overall responsibility tended to be shared with a more senior minister, but Lewis was effectively left to get on with it. Labour's record in FE is mixed. It has put more money into further education than any previous administration, but it has stretched it further by setting too many priorities. One of the first lessons Ruth Kelly, the education secretary, and her new ministerial team will get is that in public they must always follow the line that that the funding crisis is for the Learning and Skills Council to sort out. This line has already run thin. The people running colleges know that the LSC has run out of cash and that it is the government's fault. And over the next six months, many members of the public are going to pick up on this as their evening classes are scrapped. There is a game plan to look at. In broad terms, the government has decided that any 16- to 19-year-old must have a publicly funded place in a school or college, or on an apprenticeship. So successful have the government and colleges been in selling this that the LSC cannot fund all growth in college places for this age group. Colleges have to cut other bits of their operation and divert the money. Nor can the LSC fully fund all the apprenticeships that have been taken up by young people this year. As a result, the Association of Learning Providers has just issued a legal challenge to the LSC, claiming it has breached its contract with training companies that administer apprenticeships. That is something which ministers will be anxious to keep at arm's length, though again this has been due to efforts to hit a government target for the number of young people starting apprenticeships this year. The LSC was conceived with a planning role. The quango's website features details of 47 \"strategic area reviews\", one from each local LSC, which were supposed to map out the landscape for 16-19 education across the country. These are now effectively dead, as is, arguably, the LSC's wider planning role. A new herd of quangos, the sector skills councils, has lumbered into the spotlight. They are supposed to be the new strategic planning bodies. Sometime later this year Sir Andrew Foster will report on his investigations into the future role of colleges. Meanwhile, the Treasury, which does not entirely trust the Department for Education and Skills to handle \"the skills agenda\", is awaiting a report from Sandy Leitch, chairman of the National Employment Panel and formerly chief executive of Zurich Financial Services, who was commissioned by Gordon Brown to review the future skills needs of the UK economy. A curse of the job for ambitious ministers has been its almost complete dearth of opportunity for publicity. The national media, with a few exceptions, largely ignore it. As the funding crisis develops and the Tories, who made a feeble attempt to raise this in the election, realise how many of the middle classes are angry about the loss of their courses, that lack of media interest may be viewed as a blessing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
