Thirty-two people were arrested and at least one bloodied person was carried into an ambulance amid demonstrations by supporters and opponents of the Republican frontrunner. Violence has become an increasingly common feature of Trump\u2019s rallies. This week, a Trump supporter sucker-punched a protester being escorted out of a venue by police and Michelle Fields, a reporter for a conservative news site Breitbart, alleged that Trump\u2019s campaign manager assaulted her. Though Trump has said he discourages violence at his rallies, the Republican frontrunner has encouraged it at times. He recently responding to a protester by asking supporters: \u201cKnock the crap out of him, would you? Seriously, OK, just knock the hell. I promise you I will pay for the legal fees, I promise, I promise.\u201d The clashes on Friday came as hundreds of people gathered around the Peabody opera house in downtown St Louis, many having been turned away from the over-capacity rally while others were there to protest. Videos posted to social media showed Trump supporters hurling racial slurs and anti-Islamic remarks at protesters and reporters. St Louis police tackled and took away two men with their hands tied. One, who had a bloodied face, gave his name to MSNBC as Anthony Cage. He was taken into an ambulance, telling police: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d Protesters held signs declaring Trump a racist, and alluding to his remarks that Mexico is deliberately sending \u201crapists\u201d and \u201ccriminals\u201d into the US as well as his support for a wall on the border with Mexico. Trump supporters shouted back: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing racist about him at all.\u201d There were 32 total arrests, a spokeswoman for the St Louis metropolitan police department said. One person outside the venue was charged with assault and 31 people were charged with general peace disturbance. Of the people arrested, 27 were issued summonses and released, and five were booked. In several places, screaming matches nearly turned into violence. In one case, people dragged a white man away from a black woman after he became furious for having been touched and pushed her back. In another, a white man in a baseball camp gestured \u201ccome here\u201d to protesters while shouting: \u201cDo one of y\u2019all motherfuckers want to go? C\u2019mon: bring it! Bring it!\u201d Elsewhere, police broke up altercations and stray protesters on each side shouted at each other. Slogans included \u201cNo room for hate\u201d, \u201cfuck Donald Trump\u201d, \u201cfuck Islam\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ve got 100 bucks for whoever knocks that bitch out\u201d. St Louis police appear to have been on high alert; recent racially charged protests against police violence in the city and its suburbs clearly colored protests against Trump: \u201cblack lives matter\u201d signs and T-shirts were scattered throughout the picket lines. \u201cAll he is, is the KKK in street clothes,\u201d said D\u2019Angelo White, 19 and from St Louis, of Trump. Though the Trump campaign was holding a rally in St Louis, White said, \u201che don\u2019t give a fuck about nobody here\u201d. White and three of his friends were wearing blue-and-white starred bandanas over their faces as they walked away from the protest, which they said ended about 2pm. They said they had seen two or three protesters arrested, but the standoff was mostly screaming and tough-talking, not physical confrontation. White said he was frustrated that Trump supporters kept telling protesters to get a job. He said he worked 40 hours a week for $9.77 an hour. At the protest, he said, \u201ca 12-year-old told me to go get a job\u201d. \u201cI got called a nigger five times,\u201d said Najda Stroughter, a 20-year-old from St Louis. She said she was shouting \u201cFuck Trump!\u201d and that men and women shouted \u201cShut up, nigger!\u201d back at her. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be on the news, called thugs,\u201d she said. The surreality of an unusual campaign season also made itself felt: a man in a Spider-Man suit marched alongside Bernie Sanders supporters while a white-robed evangelist in a fisherman\u2019s hat preached near a pro-Trump \u201cCardinal Cowboy\u201d. But a few dozen protesters, many of them black St Louis residents, lingered outside the opera house after the rally, engaging in heated but civil debates with a group of white Trump supporters from Jefferson City. One of those supporters, Rudy Kelsey, 50, walked away from the conversation when one protester shouted that black people cannot be racist. \u201cI learned that black people still feel very discriminated against,\u201d he said. \u201cI told them them racism work both ways, and they said black people cannot be racist, and I said the dialogue\u2019s over when you say that.\u201d Kelsey told the Guardian he had been discriminated against as a white man, because he was raised Amish. \u201cMy ancestors fled Europe because of persecution,\u201d he said. \u201cMy ancestors had their heads chopped off. They were burned at the stake and drowned.\u201d Growing up, he said, \u201cwe drove a horse and buggy instead of a car. We were Amish guys. We were the butt of every joke. My dad, he always raised us to be the best people that we could possibly be. Today I\u2019m a successful self-made millionaire.\u201d Kelsey said he thought anyone could have that kind of success, \u201cregardless of who you are or what your background is, but they obviously disagree with me very strongly out here. They say it\u2019s still about color.\u201d While he was wearing a signed Trump hat, however, Kelsey said: \u201cI\u2019m not even sure I\u2019m going to vote for him.\u201d He said he had come to the rally out of curiosity; either way he was \u201cabsolutely\u201d going to vote Republican. In the aftermath of the protest, the only incident approaching violence saw a white protester grab a Make America Great Hat off the head of a Trump supporter, who was able to quickly retrieve it. \u201cThat\u2019s an autographed hat,\u201d another white man said. \u201cYou know what I\u2019m saying?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
