Officials at the Southside Presbyterian Church in Tucson hosted Daniel Noyoy Ruiz for a fourth consecutive day on Friday, and said he could remain indefinitely despite the fact he was due to be deported to Mexico earlier this week. Ruiz, 36, a building maintenance supervisor, entered the church on Wednesday afternoon with his wife and son, a few hours before the deportation deadline, in the hope that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) would not follow. \u201cWe are well, we are comfortable,\u201d he told the Guardian on Friday. \u201cWe are grateful for the support of the church and so many people. I will stay here as long as it takes to get a favourable ruling.\u201d Ice said in a statement that a court-issued removal order remained in place but that it had no immediate plan to enforce it: \u201cAfter conducting a thorough review of Mr Ruiz\u2019s immigration case, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement has decided to exercise prosecutorial discretion by not taking immediate action on Mr Ruiz\u2019s removal order.\u201d Ruiz, in other words, was safe inside the church for now but his fate would be unclear if he stepped outside. His lawyer, Margo Cowan, welcomed Ice's statement but said she had received nothing in writing from the agency and urged it to grant her application for a stay order. \u201cAnd if [they] are not inclined to do that then I want something in writing that he can carry with him on his person so that if he's stopped and asked for his status he can show that document to whomever is asking,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to have something that will protect him when he walks out of this church. This is Arizona. This is the land of 1070.\u201d A state senate bill known as 1070 has become synonymous with Arizona's controversial crackdowns on undocumented people. In recent months activists have stepped up a campaign against deportations which has included public rallies, border crossings and hunger strikes. Some have branded President Barack Obama the \u201cdeporter-in-chief\u201d, for the 2 million people banished during his administration. Pending immigration reform blocked by House Republicans, the president has urged federal authorities to enforce existing laws humanely and target only criminals for deportation. And at an event on Friday to mark the 60th anniversary of the Brown vs Board of Education school ruling that struck down school segregation, attorney general Eric Holder renewed calls for the passage of immigration reform. \u201cBy fighting for comprehensive immigration reform \u2013 that includes an earned path to citizenship, so that men and women who are Americans in everything but name can step out of the shadows and take their place in society \u2013 we\u2019ll make certain that children who have always called America home can build bright futures in, and enrich, the country they love, without fear,\u201d Holder said. Ruiz, originally from Los Mochis, Sinaloa, illegally entered the US with his wife Karla 14 years ago. They built a life in Tuscon and their son Carlos, 13, was born in the country and is a US citizen. Ruiz has no criminal record, said Cowan. Police stopped him for a faulty exhaust while driving in 2011 and his case was passed to Ice. \u201cDaniel has paid taxes for the past 10 years,\u201d Cowan said. \u201cHe attends church, sings in the choir. He's squeaky clean. I could run my hand down his back and he would squeak.\u201d Sarah Launius, a Tuscon-based activist with the immigrant rights group No More Deaths, said Ruiz was the sort of undocumented individual who was not supposed to be targeted for deportation. \u201cThe fact that he was shows the huge cracks in the system,\u201d she said. The Southside Presbyterian church was part of a sanctuary movement in the 1980s. It is headed by a female pastor, the Reverend Alison Harrington, who earned a degree in peace and conflict studies at the University of California at Berkeley. A Mexican-born undocumented migrant named Elvira Arallano made headlines in 2006 after finding refuge in a Chicago church. She was deported the following year, after leaving the church. She returned to the US in March \u2013 again without documents \u2013 and is on parole while an immigration judge considers her case."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
