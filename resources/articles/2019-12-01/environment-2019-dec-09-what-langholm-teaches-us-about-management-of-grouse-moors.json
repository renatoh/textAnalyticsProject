This is true, but hides the real lesson of the project. Despite being run by a coalition of fieldsport organisations, the study was unable to make the moor profitable without the illegal shooting, trapping and poisoning of raptors, which tracking studies show are widespread on grouse moors, and the landowner is now selling the moor. If \u201ccorrect\u201d management is not profitable, what is happening elsewhere? I should also point out that the list of birds that benefit is cherry-picked from the longer list of wildlife that declines or is actively persecuted.
