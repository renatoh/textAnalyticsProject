The genre is sparsely populated in Australian film and TV, however \u2013 some notable examples including Shine and The Sapphires, and the mini-series Friday on My Mind, INXS: Never Tear Us Apart and Olivia Newton-John: Hopelessly Devoted to You. The latter, which stars Delta Goodrem in the lead role, began with you-know-what scene (\u201cbetter shape up, doo doo doo!\u201d), making it inevitable that if a Goodrem biopic were one day made \u2013 which of course would be called Born to Try \u2013 it would require at least one scene featuring an actor playing Delta playing Olivia playing Sandy: an inception of greasy musical goodness. Now we can add to the list director Unjoo Moon\u2019s Helen Reddy biopic I Am Woman. It is a lean and likeable, if slight and a little trite, celebration of the legendary Australian-American singer, feminist and anthem-creator Helen Reddy, shot with a rich neo-noirish texture by Oscar-winning cinematographer Dion Beebe. The film\u2019s emotional essence is reflected in that beautiful, bittersweet line from her most famous song: \u201cYes I\u2019ve paid the price, but look how much I\u2019ve gained.\u201d The film, on Stan now, is about hard-fought success and breaking the glass ceiling, expressed through the narrative of a wide-eyed hopeful riding the midnight train to chance it in dimly lit venues. The film opens with Reddy (played with wonderful poise and presence by Tilda Cobham-Hervey) emerging from a New York subway in 1966 with her young daughter in tow. The protagonist will soon have cold water poured on her dreams, mansplained to by a music executive who informs her that male groups are all the rage (\u201cyou\u2019ve heard of the Beatles, right?\u201d) and insists he \u201ccan\u2019t do anything with a female singer\u201d. In the next scene she is at a bar performing I Will Follow Him \u2013 that sugary hymn of lovesick subservience \u2013 before confronting the manager and requesting a pay increase, to bring her up to parity with the men. This cigar-chomping chump barely lifts his head, responding by telling Reddy that these men have \u201cgot families to feed\u201d. You can almost visually observe the unsubtle precision of Emma Jensen\u2019s script, packing in evidence of patriarchal oppression and laying down the faultlines of an experience not just about Reddy succeeding as a woman, but earning, as the performer herself put it, \u201cwisdom born of pain\u201d. Things are a little more subtle in the relationship between Reddy and her good friend, the fellow Aussie expat and gossip columnist Lillian Roxon (Danielle Macdonald), who Reddy worries is unethical and possibly dangerous for her career. There\u2019s also her cocaine-addicted husband and manager, Jeff Wald (Evan Peters), who becomes increasingly domineering as more powder shoots up his nostrils, before ultimately morphing into Sean Penn from Hurlyburly. A key question becomes: when is she going to do the song? The big one?! In one scene Reddy writes on a piece of paper the words \u201cI AM STRONG\u201d and \u201cI AM INVINCIBLE\u201d, causing my mind to snap back to perhaps the most crudely machine-tooled \u201cinsight\u201d into the songwriting experience ever \u2013 from the 2005 biopic of Johnny Cash. (Reese Witherspoon interrupts a hard-partying Cash [Joaquin Phoenix] and yells \u201cyou can\u2019t walk no line!\u201d. Cut to the recording studio.) Moon and Jensen don\u2019t need a crowbar in a moment like that, because there is no moment, no sudden realisation. Dealing with the patriarchy is Reddy\u2019s life, and every woman\u2019s life. Despite Cobham-Hervey\u2019s radiant performance, the great singer comes across as a limited presence: more a set of principles than a character, without a single scene in which she behaves unexpectedly or in a way that challenges preconceptions. This comes down in part to a problem common in portrayals of famous people in biopics: speculate too much about them and the portrayal becomes distrustful; speculate too little and it becomes boring. The first performance of the titular track arrives around the one-hour mark \u2013 and yes, it induces tingles. Cobham-Hervey maintains a very vertical physicality; the performance seems to exist entirely in her eyes. Moon contextualises the scene, cutting to footage of women\u2019s liberation protests, aligning the film to the raison \u2018d\u2019etre of the song: the feeling this is an anthem; a celebration; a symbol of change. All anthems require a degree of simplicity, cutting through the complexities of human experience to create a feeling. The song nails that in three and a half minutes; the film stretches it out across two hours, reducing its impact but retaining its sentiment. \u2022 I Am Woman is out now on Stan \u2022 This article was amended on 5 November 2020.
