They can now take part in trips being organised by I-to-I to help rebuild shattered communities. The travel company has launched a disaster relief project in the Moratuwa suburb of Colombo, Sri Lanka, to help those affected by the tsunami floods. The project's aim is to rebuild the Shanthi community, a slum neighbourhood of 10,000 people on the beaches of which 3,000 people have been left homeless. I-to-I already had a community aid project in the area, offering care to slum children, but it was destroyed. Volunteers due to work there are instead helping with the tsunami relief project and volunteers working on other projects in Sri Lanka have moved to help on refugee camps by helping to put up tents, distribute food and water, and help with construction. Around 15 places are available on the two-week projects. Volunteers have to raise \u00a3595 to cover the costs of the placement, including a \u00a3100 donation to the project. Flights are not included. 'We have had a fantastic response, and all the places for our January and February departures are full, so we now intend to extend it to March,' said a spokeswoman. Belinda Davenport, travel and tourism lecturer at Mid-Cheshire College, called for more tour operators to set up special package holidays for people who want to help. 'The tour operators know what's going on out there and they have contacts there. They can package holidays at cost, in conjunction with the relief agencies, to give people a way of offering their help to rebuild resorts,' she said. However, an Abta spokeswoman said people wanting to go out to lend a hand were at risk of getting in the way if they went to affected areas independently. The World Service Disasters and Emergency Committee said the last thing needed in disaster situations is independent volunteers turning up offering help, and that raising funds was more appropriate, although experienced and skilled relief work ers may find opportunities on its website www.wse.org.uk. 'The best way to help the countries recover is to spend money in other unaffected areas, or take part in a properly organised volunteer scheme,' said a spokeswoman from STA Travel, which has had hundreds of calls a day from people wanting to go to Thailand to help. 'If people do go to Phuket under their own steam to try to help they should remember their travel insurance may not be valid in places where the Foreign Office is warning against travel. It is better to join an organised scheme.' The tourism authority for the Maldives said tourists bringing items to donate to the victims of the disaster were welcome. The industry response Travel Aid Leading British travel companies are pledging to donate 50p per customer in January to help rebuild communities hit by the tsunami. Under the banner Travel Aid 50, over 30 companies - including Teletext Holidays, Travelbag and Ebookers - will be giving 50p for every holiday booking taken before the end of the month. The money will go towards rebuilding infrastructure such as schools, hospitals and community centres. For a list of participating companies, email travelaid@questtravel.com Water for Sri Lanka The Association of Independent Tour Operators ( aito.co.uk) has set up a disaster fund of \u00a330,000 to go towards water purification in Sri Lanka. Aito decided that the money would be better spent on one destination rather than spreading it over several countries. Sri Lanka was chosen because of the close links forged after Aito held its 2003 conference there. Donations matched Adventure tour specialist Explore Worldwide has promised to match any customer pledges with a donation of up to \u00a310 for bookings made by phone throughout January (0870 333 4001; explore.co.uk)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
