More than a million pensioners are living on threadbare incomes because they are not receiving pension credit, a benefit designed to keep the poorest pensioners out of poverty. Pension credit is currently claimed by just six in 10 of pensioners who are entitled to it, in part because awareness of the benefit\u2019s existence is low: four in 10 people have never heard of it. Of those who have, fewer than half know who it is intended to help. Research by the Department for Work and Pensions in 2012 suggested the main barriers to receipt are people assuming they are not eligible, a perceived stigma from claiming, and misinformation, with many mistakenly believing they will lose other benefits they are entitled to if they claim it. \u201cWe actually have a relatively good idea about why uptake is so low. The problem is that the government have no idea who the eligible people not receiving pension credit are and indeed where they are,\u201d said Deborah Alsina, the chief executive of Independent Age, which commissioned the research. \u201cAny efforts from the government to meaningfully increase takeup are doomed to fail without this data, as awareness-raising activities cannot be effectively targeted on a geographic or demographic level,\u201d she added. \u201cThere has been a reluctance from the government to take responsibility for this, which is why we believe there needs to be a written, published action plan setting out how the government intends to tackle low pension credit takeup,\u201d she added. \u201cThis must include a commitment to up-to-date research, which will underpin all future activity.\u201d The research, by the centre for research in social policy at Loughborough University, concluded that if pension credit takeup were increased to 100% then almost 450,000 pensioners could be lifted out of poverty. This, the charity said, would reduce pensioner poverty, which is on the rise, to its lowest ever level while resulting in substantial savings to the NHS and social care systems. \u201cThis bill to the taxpayer is significantly higher than giving pensioners the \u00a32.2bn to which they are entitled but are not receiving,\u201d said the co-authors of the report, Prof Donald Hirsch and Dr Juliet Stone. \u201cEnsuring the poorest pensioners have a liveable income is not only the right thing to do, it\u2019s the economically responsible thing to do,\u201d said Alsina. \u201cA takeup rate of 61% for a benefit designed to keep older people out of poverty is indefensible.\u201d Bert Pearson, 94, said that without the benefit he would struggle to pay for basic essentials such as heating and food. \u201cThey rarely tell you what you\u2019re eligible for \u2013 it\u2019s up to you to go and find out for yourself,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s opened up the door to other things, like the winter fuel payment. \u201cIf I had any less than I did now, I\u2019d be struggling to get by. It would make an awful difference,\u201d said the former sergeant in the Red Devils parachute regiment during the second world war. \u201cMany people don\u2019t realise that when you\u2019re on an income like mine, you have set out pound for pound where it\u2019s going to go. Quite frankly, when you\u2019ve done that, there\u2019s nothing left.\u201d A DWP spokesperson said: \u201cWe want to make sure that all older people receive the support they are entitled to and earlier this year we ran a nationwide campaign to raise awareness of pension credit, also dispelling some myths people might hold. \u201cWe would encourage anyone who thinks they might be eligible for pension credit to visit gov.uk/pension-credit.
