Osborne's journalism was similarly bad-tempered, not least the portentous, headline-grabbing open letter, \"Damn you, England\", which he wrote from France in 1961. And then there were the private letters sent to friends, lovers and drama critics, raging at their treachery or, in the case of Jill Bennett, his fourth ex-wife - whose suicide prompted him to add a vindictive extra chapter to his memoirs - expressing regret that he hadn't been able to look into her open coffin and \"drop a good, large mess in her eye\". Nice men don't often make great writers, but nor is nastiness a guarantee of literary perpetuity, and for John Heilpern, Osborne's official biographer, the problem isn't so much excusing his subject's bad behaviour as persuading us that his plays are any good. Heilpern sets about the job as best he can, pleading the case for less well-known work such as Inadmissible Evidence and The Hotel in Amsterdam, and plucking memorable or prophetic lines from the dross. But there's no denying that other writers who emerged in the 1950s - Pinter, Larkin, Amis, Spark - have worn much better. And rather than dissect the work, Heilpern tries to solve the \"tragic puzzle\" of Osborne's personality, the \"sense of loss\" he was born with and could never get rid of, no matter how many women, Bentleys and plaudits he accrued. Osborne blamed his mother, Nellie Beatrice, for blighting his childhood; \"a year in which my mother died can't be all bad\", he wrote when she finally died aged 87 (he didn't attend the funeral). Nothing unearthed here seems to justify Osborne's hatred of her as a \"grabbing, uncaring crone\": when she writes to him \"I've nearly gone mad thinking what for Godsake have I done to hurt you so much\", the reader shares her bewilderment. But Heilpern offers a kind of double-Rosebud theory to explain the resentment: not only did Nellie Beatrice fail to keep her husband alive (he died of TB when John was 10), she also failed to save her \"exquisite\" infant daughter (she too died of TB, when John was a baby). Whatever the source of his psychic wound, John remained suspicious of women - as witches, vultures and vampires - for the rest of his life. To mislay three wives might be counted unlucky; to mislay four looks positively careless. Osborne found happiness only with his fifth wife, Helen Dawson, having meanwhile got through three actresses (Pamela Lane, Mary Ure, Bennett) and a writer, Penelope Gilliatt. There were mistresses, too, including the beautiful costume designer Jocelyn Rickards; when they were in bed together, she confided, he \"used to hold his dick like a ukelele and sing George Formby songs\". As Osborne admitted, he ran his emotional life as chaotically as a chimp piloting a jumbo jet. The high point, or low point, came in August 1961, when he bashed off his \"Damn you, England\" letter from the French farmhouse where he was staying with Rickards while his second wife, Ure, gave birth to a son in London, and in Italy Gilliatt received his charming marriage proposal (\"Will you marry me? It's risky, but you'd get fucked regularly\"). The baby son was probably not Osborne's, as Heilpern shows; a similar piece of sleuthing allows him to crush the suggestion that Osborne had a homosexual affair with his friend and collaborator Anthony Creighton. But there's no disputing the paternity of Nolan, the daughter he produced with Gilliatt, and when his third wife descended into alcoholism in New York, Osborne, then living in Kent with wife number five, took Nolan under his wing. It was an opportunity to atone for his own miserable childhood by offering his teenage daughter love and support. Instead, he chucked her out at 17, removing her from school for good measure. Her only crime seems to have been a lack of interest in her father's thespian friends (\"There is not one of them who is not worth a dozen low lifes like you,\" he reproached her). He never saw her again. \"Nolan's birthday,\" he wrote in his notebook when she turned 22, \"God rot her.\" By then, Osborne was losing it on several fronts, including the financial. \"First class all the way, Skipper,\" his father liked to say, and the son took the motto to heart, sustaining himself with champagne 24/7. If the plays were what made him famous, it was the screenplay he wrote for Tom Jones that made him a millionaire. A cameo acting performance in Get Carter brought in money as well. But at the end he was vastly in debt. \"Sorry\" was his last word to Dawson, though he had less reason to apologise to her than to many others. In his final years, when he camped it up as a churchgoing country gent, much of the ranting - against theatre critics, feminists, lefties, social workers and so on - was silly and predictable. It pained him deeply that more of his plays weren't put on, but whenever the chance was there he blew it, by falling out with potential directors and lead actors. He was his own worst enemy and in moments of rueful clarity he knew it. Osborne's saving grace, as Pinter said, was his humour: \"He liked to take the piss out of everyone, including himself.\" He'd surely enjoy the jokes in this biography, some of them his, some the author's and some retold by the many people who were interviewed during the course of the research. Though no great stylist, Heilpern is sharp, gossipy and good fun, and he honours the best of Osborne without disguising the worst. It's just a pity that the plays are so much less dramatic than the life. \u00b7 Blake Morrison's Things My Mother Never Told Me is published by Vintage"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
