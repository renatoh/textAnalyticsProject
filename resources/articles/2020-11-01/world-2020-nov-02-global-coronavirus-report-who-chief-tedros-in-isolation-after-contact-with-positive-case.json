With the virus again spreading rapidly across Europe and elsewhere, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who is based in Geneva, made the announcement by Twitter late on Sunday night, but stressed he had no symptoms. \u201cI have been identified as a contact of someone who has tested positive for \u001dCovid-19,\u201d Tedros said in his tweet. \u201cI am well and without symptoms but will self-quarantine over the coming days, in line with @WHO protocols, and work from home,\u201d he added. Tedros has been at the forefront of the UN health agency\u2019s efforts to battle the pandemic, which has claimed the lives of 1.2 million and infected more than 46.6 million people worldwide since emerging in China late last year, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. He stressed on Twitter that \u201cit is critically important that we all comply with health guidance. This is how we will break chains of \u001dCovid-19 transmission, suppress the virus, and protect health systems.\u201d Countries across Europe reintroduced or strengthened existing lockdown measures on Monday. Germany went into \u201clockdown light\u201d mode, with bars, cinemas, theatres, museums, fitness studios and swimming pools closing and cafes and restaurants allowed to offer takeaway food only. Meetings in public have been restricted to two households or no more than 10 people. Unlike during the first lockdown in the spring, schools and nurseries will stay open. The new \u201cwave breaker\u201d restrictions will for now only apply until the end of the month, but the government is not ruling out an extension. On Sunday, the health minister, Jens Spahn, called on the public to prepare for \u201cmonths of restrictions and abstinence\u201d. The chancellor, Angela Merkel, told a news conference on Monday that Germany was still some way off an end to the pandemic but if people respected the restrictions over the next four weeks \u201cthen we will be able to have the conditions for a tolerable December.\u201d \u201cThroughout the winter months, we will have to limit private contacts,\u201d Merkel said. \u201cThe light at the end of the tunnel is still quite a long way off.\u201d Italy will tighten its restrictions but is holding back from reintroducing a nationwide lockdown, its prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said, as infections, hospital admissions and deaths rise. Conte told Italy\u2019s parliament tougher measures, including curbing travel between the worst-hit regions and a night-time curfew, were now needed. Italy\u2019s daily tally of infections has increased tenfold over the last month and hovered around 30,000 in the last few days, while hospital admissions, intensive care occupancy and deaths have also risen steeply. \u201cDespite our efforts \u2026 the evolution of the epidemic in the last few days is very worrying,\u201d Conte said, adding that intensive care units would be overwhelmed in 15 of Italy\u2019s 20 regions by next month unless tougher action was taken. \u201cWe must intervene with more stringent measures,\u201d he told the Chamber of Deputies, saying the country would be divided into three areas depending on the risk level, with certain places facing tighter restrictions than others. Meanwhile, Portugal\u2019s prime minister, Ant\u00f3nio Costa, asked the country\u2019s president to declare a state of emergency as a preventive measure to fight the spread of the virus The last Covid-19 state of emergency, which under Portuguese law is limited to 15 days but can be extended indefinitely in 15-day periods if necessary, was declared by President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa in March and lasted six weeks. \u201cIt is a critical moment and declaring the \u2026 emergency will reinforce the civic awareness of the sanitary emergency we are facing,\u201d Costa told reporters, adding the move was likely to last much longer than 15 days. The president was expected to proclaim the emergency in a televised address on Monday evening and then parliament would then have to enact it \u2013 both are considered formalities. The weekend was marked by street protests against further restrictions on daily life, including in Italy and Spain, where the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, called for an end to \u201cthe violent and irrational behaviour\u201d of a minority of people after demonstrations against the government\u2019s decision to declare a six-month state of emergency. On Sunday night more than 300 people gathered in the centre of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, to protest against state governor Jo\u00e3o Doria\u2019s support for mandatory Covid-19 immunisation and testing the potential vaccine developed by China\u2019s Sinovac. The country\u2019s health minister, Eduardo Pazuello, who is ill with Covid, remained in hospital on Sunday night after having been discharged from a civilian facility earlier in the day. Anti-science sentiment was also on display in the US, where supporters of Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Florida on Sunday night began chanting \u201cFire Fauci\u201d \u2013 and the president hinted that he may do so after the election. The hostility towards Dr Anthony Fauci, the US government\u2019s leading expert on infectious diseases, comes after he angered the White House by warning that the coming winter would see the virus continue to spread. Two weeks ago, Trump suggested that Fauci was an \u201cidiot\u201d. Reuters contributed to this report"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
