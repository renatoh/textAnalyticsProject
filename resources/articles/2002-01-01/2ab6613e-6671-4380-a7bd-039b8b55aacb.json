In a brief statement confirming the crash, US central command did not say whether there were survivors. It said the names of the service members were being withheld until their relatives had been informed. Central command, which is based in Florida and is responsible for US military operations in Pakistan and the surrounding region, said that the KC-130 aircraft crashed as it was making its landing approach at a base in Shamsi in south-west Pakistan. The KC-130 is a \u00a326m plane routinely used by the marine corps for in-flight refuelling of helicopters. It is also used for troop and cargo delivery, evacuation missions and special operations support. The aircraft is normally operated with a six-man crew of two pilots, a navigator, flight engineer, mechanic and a loadmaster, but the crew can be as many as eight people. Pakistan and several other countries in the region have made bases available to the US military campaign in Afghanistan. The US president, George Bush, has been informed of the crash, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
