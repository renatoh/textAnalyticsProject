For two and a half years, all seemed serene. Then council leader Bill Stephenson stepped down due to ill health and mayhem arrived to take his place. Stephenson's deputy Thaya Idaikkadar assumed the helm, elected by the Labour group. But the following April he was replaced. Idaikkadar claimed there were \"elements of racism\" behind the move against him. And so, along with eight fellow dissidents, he formed a minority Independent Labour administration with the support of the Conservatives. All that was a year ago. The arrangement held until September when the Tories withdrew their support resulting in Idaikkadar's replacement as council leader by Tory group leader Susan Hall - with the Independent Labour group's support. Earlier this year Hall got her budget through and Independent Labour got an investigation into alleged institutional racism at the council. Last month, the investigators declared there was none. What a very big old mess it's been. And so, after having their council run by three different administrations in eighteen months, Harrow's voters again have the chance to be the ones who decide who is in charge. Labour expects to win again, but no less than 44 Independent Labour candidates are contesting 16 of Harrow's 21 wards. They might not win any seats, but merely by their presence seem likely to pare down the Labour vote to some extent, including through people voting for them by accident. Stepping back from all of that, Harrow looks to be moving Labour's way long term as do several other Outer London boroughs. Before 2010 the party had only controlled Harrow once - from 1998 to 2002 - with Tories in command throughout most of the borough's history. Interestingly, though, the Tories won a bigger share of the overall vote last time, reflecting Labour's winning several seats by very fine margins. Three wards produced split results, including one - Rayners Lane - where one Tory, one Labour and one Lib Dem candidate were returned. For all its Metro-land image, Harrow may still have the potential for a spot of political upset."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
