The Labour leader said his \u201cfirm\u201d message to the president, who is in Britain for a Nato summit, was that under a Labour majority in the Commons neither the NHS nor any other public service would be part of trade talks. Corbyn\u2019s comments came as Trump insisted he would not seek to include access to the NHS in a future trade deal. \u201cI don\u2019t even know where that rumour started,\u201d Trump told the travelling White House press in an impromptu briefing at the US ambassador\u2019s residence in London. \u201cWe have absolutely nothing to do with it and we wouldn\u2019t want to if you handed it to us on a silver platter. We want nothing to do with it.\u201d Saying he had \u201cno thoughts\u201d on the UK election, Trump was asked whether he could work with Corbyn as prime minister. He replied: \u201cI can work with anybody, I\u2019m a very easy person to work with.\u201d Corbyn, speaking outside Soas University of London during a speech on workers\u2019 rights as part of his election campaign, said: \u201cIn any trade deal with the United States with a Labour government public services will not be put on the table. Our NHS will not be put up for sale because public services are there for a reason. \u201cThey are not there to be sold off to international firms that want to come in and run our NHS.\u201d He was joined by cleaners and porters who now work for the university as in-house staff and have pension, sick leave and maternity rights, after a long campaign that Corbyn and the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, have supported since 2006. The Labour leader told the crowd: \u201cDonald Trump has arrived in Britain. I saw it because his convoy went past my house last night. So I know he\u2019s here.\u201d He said he welcomed all visitors to the UK but wanted to \u201cvery gently, quite simply but extremely firmly\u201d remind Trump the NHS was not on the table in any talks to try to secure post-Brexit trade. Corbyn is focusing his campaign on Labour\u2019s charter for workers\u2019 rights and its promise to eradicate zero-hours contracts, raise the minimum wage and give employees rights from their first day of work. He likened the contracts, which affect 1 million Britons, to early 20th-century work practices for dockers and builders where the employer held \u201call the aces\u201d in their relationship. He said: \u201cThere was a time in Camden Town when lots of building workers would queue up outside the station and wait for an employer to drive by and possibly offer them a day\u2019s labouring. They had no guarantee what their income would be, no guarantee they could pay their rent, feed their children or live a normal decent life. \u201cI thought those days were over when legislation brought in to outlaw those kind of practices. In reality, a zero-hours contract where you spend all day staring at your mobile phone hoping for a text message that is going to give you a few hours\u2019 work somewhere else, is no really any different. It\u2019s just the technology that is different. So we will end zero-hours contracts once and for all.\u201d Flanking Corbyn during his speech were members of the Soas Justice for Cleaners campaign, supported by the students\u2019 union, Unison and the UCU. The staff now have contracts that should be emulated across the country, the Labour leader said. Lenin Escudero, 43, who is a cleaner supervisor at Soas, said the lives of workers had changed significantly since they were employed directly and given the same basic employment rights as university staff. The father-of-three, who is originally from Ecuador, said in 2006 cleaners were on \u00a35 an hour and now earn \u00a312 an hour and have pensions, sick pay and 43 days\u2019 annual leave. He said: \u201cWe were invisible before but during the campaign people started to notice us. Jeremy Corbyn supported us in this campaign from day one.\u201d Breaking into Spanish during his speech, Corbyn said workers should continue their struggle for \u201cwhat is right and for social justice\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
