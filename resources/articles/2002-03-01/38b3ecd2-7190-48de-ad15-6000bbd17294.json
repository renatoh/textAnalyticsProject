The nine-year-old was a 12-1 co-favourite for Aintree with Ladbrokes yesterday morning, but now Pat Murphy, his trainer, must work towards Liverpool 2003. Supreme Glory's success at Chepstow in December came at the end of a year of personal tragedies for Murphy, who lost his teenage daughter in a road accident and within months suffered the breakdown of his marriage. The prospect of sending him to Aintree was a reason for Murphy to look forward, and a run in the race remains the long-term plan. \"It is a real kick in the teeth and it makes you appreciate days like the Welsh National even more,\" Murphy said yesterday. \"It is less than 10% of the circumference of the tendon that is injured, which shows how minor it is, but if we carry on we will make it worse. \"He will have a six-month break and I would imagine his preparation next season will be geared to Aintree again. Although he is nine, he has only had 17 races so there are not a lot of miles on the clock.\" With Supreme Glory now scratched, there are effectively 82 names left in the running for the National after the latest declaration stage yesterday. The total is a new record for the second forfeit stage, beating the 73 who remained at the same point 12 months ago, and a maximum field of 40 for the race itself seems certain. Leading Kentucky Derby hope Johannesburg and 2000 Guineas favourite Hawk Wing were in action as Aidan O'Brien made a surprise visit to Lingfield yesterday. They were among six horses their trainer worked on the Polytrack surface as he sought to combat the wet spring which has hindered preparations at his Ballydoyle stable in Ireland. O'Brien was pleased with conditions at Lingfield and is also considering saddling Johannesburg in a proposed trial race for three-year-old colts on the track on Grand National day. \u00b7 Today's scheduled meeting at Towcester was called off yesterday morning due to waterlogging."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
