Share your experiences", "bodyText": "Gardens are important habitats for a range of species including small mammals, songbirds and insects. Although it might seem a small contribution, gardening in a wildlife-friendly way can make a massive difference in counteracting biodiversity loss. In the UK, for example, gardens take up more space than all nature reserves combined. We want to see photos of what you\u2019ve been doing to help. Perhaps you\u2019ve built a bug hotel?
