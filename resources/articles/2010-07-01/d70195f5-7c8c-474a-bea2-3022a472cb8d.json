The Scot's headaches revolve around the selection \"problems\" confronting him as he puts together a team to face the United States in Wales this autumn. Please feel free to resist the urge to send him a family-size bottle of Paracetamol. Corey Pavin, the American captain, almost certainly will. While Montgomerie grapples with the issue of who to leave out of his team, the US captain grapples with the issue of who he can possibly bring into his. He could, for instance, quite justifiably select himself \u2013 after all, he almost won a PGA Tour event this year and he was leading the field last week at the halfway stage of the strongest event on the Champions Tour. (Montgomerie, who can barely make a cut these days, need have no worries on this score, incidentally.) Pavin has always had a keen sense of his own talents, as well an insatiable appetite for the carnivorous brand of competition provided by the Ryder Cup. However, orthodoxy dictates that captains do not play in the event so he will have to look to others if he is to retain the trophy so thrillingly won by Paul Azinger's side two years ago in Kentucky. \"I'm a fairly laid\u2011back guy. The really important stuff for me is the team itself,'' the American captain said last week when asked how he was coping with the strains of the job. \"It is starting to take shape now. I still have three more weeks before eight players will be automatically on the team then another three weeks after that until I make my captain's picks. I don't think that is going to be as hard for me as maybe some other captains \u2013 it doesn't seem like it's going to be difficult.\" Pavin was hardly likely to say anything else, although such insouciance seems somewhat out of place given the current state of the US Ryder Cup points list. In normal times the sight of Phil Mickelson, Tiger Woods, Anthony Kim, Steve Stricker, Dustin Johnson and Jim Furyk \u2013 to name six of the eight players occupying an automatic spot on the team \u2013 would inspire confidence. But these are not normal times for American golf. How can they be when the greatest player of the modern era is trying to shake himself free of a crushing personal scandal? Of the other five, Kim is suffering a long-term injury, Mickelson has never been a reliable Ryder Cup winner, Johnson is a rookie who has shown a propensity to crumble under pressure (see the final round of this year's US Open) and Furyk, after a victory in March, is having a middling season. Only Stricker, who won on the PGA Tour the week before the Open Championship and is arguably the best putter in the game, is apparently without problems. Matt Kuchar and the former US Open winner Lucas Glover, the other two automatic choices, are decent players but their presence on the 1st tee at Celtic Manor is unlikely to be met with the sound of knocking knees. And where does Pavin look when it comes to his four wild card picks? Of the players just outside the top eight only Hunter Mahan, currently 11th, might be judged an automatic choice, having performed well in the US's win at Kentucky. Otherwise it is perm any three from an undistinguished list of PGA Tour plodders or throw the points list out of the window and choose the former Masters winner Zach Johnson, another great putter (a Ryder Cup necessity), or take a punt on Ricky Fowler, the best of the young American players. No wonder most American commentators have a sense of foreboding about the coming trip to Wales. As for the few who remain optimistic \u2013 perhaps they have yet to take a look at the European points list. Already, before the final line-up has been set or a ball has been struck, a consensus has been forming that this may be the best Europe team ever. Certainly it seems destined to be the strongest from No1 to No12, as Montgomerie suggested the other day. \"I could pick two teams that could beat each other on any given day,\" he said. He was exaggerating, though only just. The depth of top-class talent at his disposal is probably 20 deep, four short of two complete teams but more than enough to fuel the headaches to which Montgomerie constantly refers. At an early stage in his captaincy the Scot spoke of his \"ideal\" team, a list he tucked away in his sock drawer. One has to assume it included players such as Lee Westwood, Rory McIlroy, Ian Poulter, Martin Kaymer, Graeme McDowell and Luke Donald. All six are in one of the nine automatic slots, but what of those who are not, including Padraig Harrington, Paul Casey, Henrik Stenson, Justin Rose, Robert Karlsson and Sergio Garc\u00eda? Six into three does not go, and either Francesco Molinari and Ross McGowan, neither of whom, it has to be assumed, were on the captain's list, drop out of the automatic slots over the next month, or there will be at least one or two very notable absentees in Wales. It will not be Harrington, to whom Montgomerie has all but guaranteed a place, or Rose, who is arguably one of the best three players in the world right now. That leaves four players fighting for one place, and a contest that could go all the way to the Johnny Walker Championship at Gleneagles, the final event before the team is announced. Four years ago, Nick Faldo angered the European Tour brass when he gave his two wild cards to Poulter and Casey, neither of whom made the trip to Scotland. This time around, expect everyone to be present and correct. \"There's a number of world stars that aren't already qualified within that team. We know the situation they are in. And I've spoken to most of those players over the last month, and they know the position they are in,\" Montgomerie said last week. In other words, turn up in Scotland at the end of August or you will not in Wales a couple of months later."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
