A Woman in Berlin, the diary of a German woman from spring 1945, is an unforgettable testament that pulls you into the menace and fear of the times it describes. \"All I can do is brace myself for what's to come, and try to keep my inner flame alive,\" says the narrator. First published in 1954, the book then disappeared from view because of the poor reaction that it received. Because it deals frankly with the systematic rapes carried out against German women, it was called a \"shameless immorality\" rather than a brave and moral document. Only now does the time seem right for this woman's voice to be heard. Rape in war has, through out history, been downgraded as a regrettable side-effect of the important and interesting conflicts that take place between men on battlefields. In contrast, the conflicts that take place between men and women in houses, on streets, on farms, have been seen as merely personal, as the trauma traditionally borne by women privately. Tellingly, although the author of this particular account is now dead, she remains officially anonymous. Never able to seek justice for what happened to her, she wanted to keep her identity secret because of the sense of personal shame that she was forced to carry to the end of her life. In the aftermath of the second world war, when the victors tried to bring justice to the perpetrators of war crimes, rape hardly figured - unsurprisingly, given that the victors were culpable along with the losers. It was only well after 1945 that a transformation of the way we look at rape in war began, spearheaded by feminists who dared to insist that women's rights were human rights. From the 1970s onwards, women brought to the fore the fact that war is not just fought between men and men, but also by men on the bodies of women. More than 10 years ago the feminist lawyer Catharine MacKinnon asked the world to take the \"historic opportunity\" to look at what was happening in the former Yugoslavia and to make \"this the time and the place, and these the women, when the world recognises that violence against women violates human rights\". And that has at last begun to happen. The first cases in which the perpetrators of systematic rape have successfully been prosecuted as perpetrators of crimes against humanity have since taken place, at the international tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. We can look at these trials, and we can say that we do live in a world that has moved on, in which the bodies of civilian women are not automatically seen as part of the booty of war. Even so, the progress has not been nearly as far-reaching as we might have hoped. Western powers have been reluctant to look at their own culpability. It is extraordinary to realise that although we have heard so much, down the years, about the atrocities carried out a generation ago by American troops in Vietnam, the soldiers who took their war of aggression on to the bodies of women have, by and large, walked away from justice. Even the well-known massacre and mass rape at My Lai - perhaps the only war crime that everyone in the United States agrees actually happened - ended with impunity for the perpetrators. As Sadakat Kadri retells impatiently in his recent book The Trial, even the unit commander, Lieutenant William Calley, who joked at his trial that a soldier under his command \"would look kind of funny\" if he hadn't pulled up his pants after forcing a woman to give him oral sex, only served three days of his sentence behind bars. And although the law has moved on, that does not mean that the experiences of women caught in the wars of the world are any different from what they would have been in 1945, or 1967, or 1994. Because, although we may have got better at talking about what is going on, we are no better at stopping it. When it comes to the Democratic Republic of Congo, where mass rape has been used by every side in the long-running civil war, there is no sense of urgency in the international community to punish the perpetrators or treat the victims. Every now and again journalists or human rights workers travel to the forests and bring back heart-rending tales of the physical and mental trauma that the women suffer. But who is listening? Even UN peacekeepers have now been implicated in the sexual abuse of Congolese women. Systematic sexual violence is still being carried out on thousands of women and children, and each is still being forced to suffer by herself. They have to live with their violated bodies as a personal shame, rather than being able to speak publicly about the nature of these war crimes. As one Congolese interviewee said recently in Ms magazine: \"If I give my name to try to get justice, then when they come back, I will be attacked, or my family.\" Or as the anonymous narrator of A Woman in Berlin said: \"I feel so hopelessly alone.\" n.walter@btinternet.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
