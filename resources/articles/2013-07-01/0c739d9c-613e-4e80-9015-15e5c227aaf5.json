Sin City. Lost Wages. Nice place to visit but you wouldn't want to live there \u2026 Whoa, not so fast. Us Las Vegans love it here, but there are certain rules to follow. First, we avoid the Strip. If we are hit with the urge to swoon to Andrea Bocelli, we just grab a stiff one and wait for it to pass. Second, we \"locals\" cultivate the perception that we are cheap. And businesses have listened so a night on the town is a thrift-shop expedition of wine, women and song. First the wine: Happy Hour is a huge moving party. Poppy Den is at Tivoli Village, an upscale retail and office centre in the northwest section of town. Poppy Den is a small space, so head for the bar \u2013 it opens on to a large patio. The other night, cute bartenders served me all the champagne I could handle and a nice tuna devilled egg for all of $10. For something more polished for happy hour, I hit Fleming's - it's a white-tablecloth, wood and leather steak place, famous for its $6 offerings. Due Forni (3555 Town Center Drive, +1 702 586 6500, dueforni.com), a little way south, does the same thing but with Italian flair, although they screen very odd old movies \u2013 some with a lot of bouncing breasts \u2013 in the retro 1970s dining area. Food comes next. Try Oscar's (1 Main Street, +1 702 386 7227, ) downtown, for a walk down memory lane. Named after former mayor Oscar Goodman, who began as a defence lawyer for colourful characters, he bills the steakhouse as a place for \"beef, booze and broads\". Photos from Vegas' past grace the walls, and Frank and Dean sing in the bar. You might run into former Mayor Goodman, or the current Mayor Goodman \u2013 his wife, Carolyn. Now for the song. Monday night at the Bootlegger (7700 Las Vegas Boulevard South, bootleggerlasvegas.com) is the place to be. It's owned by a lady named Lorraine who started as a singer and rose to lieutenant-governor (and never stopped performing). It has velvet walls, waiters in spats, thousands of photos of old Vegas, and a lounge room like those the Rat Pack performed in. Sit at the first set of tables to have the singers practically in your lap. On Mondays, most shows on the Strip are \"dark\" \u2013 while the headliners rest, the back-up talent steps up. Music experience starts at Bootleggers at 9pm and runs until the last guest passes out or goes home. If your tastes run down and dirty, try Double Down (4640 Paradise Road, doubledownsaloon.com), a ramshackle bar that serves Ass Juice. For a nightcap, there's DCR (111 Las Vegas Boulevard South, thedowntownlv.com), where most of the light comes from the back-lit bottles behind the bar. The entertainment is a huge one-way window giving the patrons inside an unimpeded view of the struggles of those on the outside trying to guess how to open the freakin' door. Don't get put off \u2013 it's a fun game.The Lady Silvia is a speakeasy with no sign \u2013 on Hoover Street, west of the Strip, look for the neon 140/150 over an unmarked door. Or try Frankie's Tiki Room (1712 West Charleston, frankiestikiroom.com) with torches, grass thatch, and wooden flooring. Every night on the town must end at Drink and Drag. Enjoy dancing, bowling (free if you bowl in your underwear), young men in tightie-whities, and others in gowns, jewellery and make-up, who sing and dance to Diana Ross. All are welcome and have a wonderful time. Sorta like Vegas.
