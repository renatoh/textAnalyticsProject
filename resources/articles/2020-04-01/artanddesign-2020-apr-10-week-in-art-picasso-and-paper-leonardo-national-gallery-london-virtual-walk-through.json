Antonello was one of the first Italian artists to explore the subtlety of oil paints, which he learned about from Flemish paintings that made their way to the court of Naples. Here he uses that refined skill to paint a very human, vulnerable Christ whose agony on the cross is all the more touching for being realistic, without the gore and horror of medieval art. Antonello anticipates Michelangelo in making us feel an almost sensual compassion for Jesus. This is an eloquent pared back Easter egg of powerful feeling. \u2022 National Gallery, London.
