The AMA, which has led criticism of the government\u2019s decision in the budget to introduce a $7 co-payment for GP visits, plans to release its alternative proposal to the media on Thursday. It is understood the proposal includes blanket exemptions for pensioners, children under 16, and people with chronic illnesses. The AMA model would not include the government\u2019s proposal to cut by $5 the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) rebates received by practices \u2013 a key plank of the budget plan to raise money for a medical research future fund. The amount patients would pay may also be lower in the AMA model. Terry Barnes, a former health adviser to Tony Abbott when he was health minister, said broad exemptions would be administratively difficult. \u201cIt\u2019s important that the AMA solution is not self-serving; that it is publicly scrutinised to see if it is in the best interests of Australians, not the AMA and its members,\u201d he said. Barnes proposed a Medicare co-payment in a submission to the government\u2019s audit commission late last year, triggering public debate before the Coalition revealed its own plan in the budget. Barnes\u2019s paper was commissioned by the Australian Centre for Health Research, a thinktank established by several health funds and private hospitals. The AMA\u2019s president, Brian Owler, said he would brief other GP groups in Canberra on Thursday morning before releasing the association\u2019s alternative plan. \u201cThe AMA model achieve the aims of protecting vulnerable patients in the community, and values general practice to encourage quality and support prevention and chronic disease management,\u201d Owler said. The government is considering the AMA proposal and talking with crucial crossbench senators, but has previously warned that it would be \u201cvery hard to provide blanket exemptions\u201d. The government model as announced in the budget would not exempt pensioners and children under 16, but people in those groups would revert to bulk-billing after 10 services within a calendar year. The health minister, Peter Dutton, told Sky News last week a blanket exemption for anyone on a pension or under the age of 16 would represent \u201calmost 9 million Australians out of a population of 23 million\u201d. On Wednesday, Abbott reinforced the view that the government did not want to fully exempt pensioners from the Medicare co-payment. The prime minister said pensioners were not exempted from the existing Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) co-payment for subsidised medicines, although the co-payment was less for concessional patients than for general patients. He told the 4BC radio station: \u201cIf we don\u2019t exempt pensioners from the PBS co-payment, why should they be entirely exempted from the Medicare co-payment?\u201d Barnes said the co-payment debate had highlighted the need to reform safety net arrangements for both the PBS and the MBS, saying it did not make sense for policy to consider the two issues separately. \u201cIn the interests of fairness and transparency Medicare and the pharmaceutical safety nets should be combined so we look at people\u2019s total health spend not just bits of it,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cIt\u2019s become very clear to me over the last few months you can\u2019t look at a person\u2019s Medicare spend without looking at their PBS spend.\u201d Labor and the Greens are firmly against introducing a Medicare co-payment, meaning it cannot pass the Senate unless the government persuades the Palmer United party senators to drop their opposition. Labor\u2019s health spokeswoman, Catherine King, said the opposition would not consider a compromise proposal because \u201cno amount of fiddling can fix Tony Abbott\u2019s rotten GP tax\u201d. \u201cThe GP tax is a direct attack on the fundamental principle of Medicare that the best quality healthcare is available to every Australian,\u201d she said. King said Abbott\u2019s comment about exemptions for pensioners showed \u201ccontempt\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
