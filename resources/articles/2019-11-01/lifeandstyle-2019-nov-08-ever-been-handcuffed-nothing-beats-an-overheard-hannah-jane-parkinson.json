That humans are capable of saying things so unexpected, bizarre, idiotic, hilarious or filthy is one of the great, simple joys in life. Strip such remarks from their context and they can indeed be elevated into art. Or perhaps you know the context, but marvel at the opinion or observation. You might let your nostrils flare in mirth, or catch the eye of the speaker to signal agreement. Then there is the jaw-drop of something utterly moronic said behind you on public transport. Messaging it to a pal to share the goods. Barking with laughter when remembering it, months later. Children are great value when it comes to overheards. The New York toddler who waved to a pigeon and said: \u201cBye, street chicken!\u201d Or the mother I heard saying to (presumably) her daughter: \u201cNo, betting isn\u2019t a job, darling.\u201d But there are gems in every category, as a website called BoredPanda attests. Sex exchanges: \u201cHave you ever been handcuffed?\u201d \u201cSexually or by law enforcement?\u201d Witty back-and-forths: \u201cHow drunk were you last night?\u201d \u201cI donated money to Wikipedia.\u201d Snarky ones: \u201cDoesn\u2019t she have a tattoo that says \u2018relevant\u2019?\u201d \u201cYeah, but it\u2019s fading, so that\u2019s fitting.\u201d There-but-for-the-grace-of-God ones: \u201cI was wearing that new camo jacket and someone thanked me for my service.\u201d The tears-inducing, like a woman asking where to find the frozen vegetables and a cashier replying: \u201cThe freezer.\u201d And the woman responding: \u201cThank you.\u201d A Twitter account popular among journalists is @OHnewsroom, for Overheard In The Newsroom. I went back to look at things I heard in the Guardian newsroom: a colleague remarking they had spent New Year\u2019s Eve at L Ron Hubbard\u2019s house; a mix-up between PJ Harvey and Brian Harvey from East 17; and someone saying: \u201cJust Google \u2018cat, parasite, depression\u2019.\u201d I can only imagine. Why do I keep a note of them? Because overheards provide wonderful material. I heard a man say to his mate at a bar: \u201cTo some people, it\u2019s black and white with Nazi criminals.\u201d That one found its way into the mouth of a short story character. The phrase is to keep one\u2019s ears to the ground. I recommend keeping one\u2019s head up, to catch the end of businessmen\u2019s back-and-forth; the denouement of an argument; the riffs of reuniting friends. Nuggets of intrigue, comedy, shock. Please, go on: I\u2019m listening."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
