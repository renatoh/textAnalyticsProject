Spurs\u2019 first loss under their new head coach came against his former club, with two Marcus Rashford goals securing victory for Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side after Alli\u2019s equaliser. Afterwards, the England midfielder stated \u201carrogance\u201d and \u201coverconfidence\u201d cost his team and Mourinho agreed. \u201cI tried to fight exactly that state of mind,\u201d he said. \u201cI tried to tell them exactly the way United approach these matches at home \u2013 against Liverpool [1-1 draw], against Chelsea [4-0 win], always they start strong with people running, pressing, trying to lift the morale of the supporters. \u201cNormally they come from bad results against smaller teams so when they face the big teams people think it\u2019s going to be more difficult for them. It\u2019s not more difficult for them because the style changes and they feel comfortable against this style of play. \u201cIn the second half we knew what we were going to do with the result at 1-1. After one minute you concede a goal. We have to blame ourselves. I think United must obviously be happy with the points, and overall they deserved it.\u201d Rashford returned a man-of-the-match display that was praised by his manager. \u201cIt\u2019s the best he\u2019s had under me,\u201d said Solskj\u00e6r. \u201cHe was mature, strong against good Premier League players. His penalty [the winner] was calm and composed, and his first goal \u2013 we know he\u2019s got those [long-range strikes in him and he had three or four chances. \u201cIt\u2019s like he was back on the playground or in the back garden. We want them to have fun, there\u2019s nothing dangerous out there - just 75,00 people, wanting to see the best.\u201d The win lifts United to sixth ahead of Saturday\u2019s derby at Manchester City. \u201cThe three points are massive for us\u201d said Solskjaer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
