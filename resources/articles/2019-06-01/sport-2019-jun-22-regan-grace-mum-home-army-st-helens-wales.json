I felt like I was in the army\u2019", "bodyText": "Port Talbot to St Helens via a stint as a scaffolder in between is far from an average route to professional rugby league but Regan Grace is not an average rugby league player. The 22-year-old is perhaps the most exciting Welsh talent to have played the sport for a generation, having already established a reputation as one of the best wings in Super League. How he got to this point, however, is unconventional. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know what rugby league was growing up,\u201d Grace says. \u201cOne of my teachers in Port Talbot chucked me into playing union and I loved it and quickly realised I wanted to play for my home town \u2013 which I did \u2013 then Ospreys, and then Wales. Most kids in Wales who play rugby dream of playing for the national team. I was no different.\u201d It is perhaps no surprise Grace was not exposed to league until the age of 16, given he grew up in a union-dominated region of Wales. But when he did, he quickly fell in love with the sport. \u201cI\u2019d already played a couple of games with the under-16s at Ospreys but I left to go properly with rugby league,\u201d he says. \u201cI loved the fact I could go and get the ball whenever and try to make things happen. It was a perfect fit.\u201d The semi-professional side South Wales Scorpions \u2013 who have since relocated west to Llanelli \u2013 soon spotted Grace\u2019s ability. \u201cWe had a good academy side there, and were beating established teams like Salford, but the team got broken up. Some lads got deals back in union but I carried on playing both.\u201d Grace continued to play amateur rugby league but, now aged 17, was facing up to the prospect of his dream of turning professional evaporating. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what I was doing in life. I just thought I\u2019d go and get a job in scaffolding or something like that,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI thought the professional career had passed me by.\u201d But then a chance meeting changed everything. \u201cI started playing amateur rugby union for Aberavon Quins and someone there knew the St Helens chairman. He said if I wanted to take it seriously, there might be a chance, and I got a trial for the academy up here.\u201d It proved a gamble worth taking. Fast forward to the present day and Grace is already a Welsh international in league, as well as one of the most thrilling players in Super League, but not before an unforgettable first few weeks as a professional which almost made him quit and head back to Port Talbot. \u201cI remember calling my mum to tell her I was coming home because I felt like I was in the army during that first pre-season,\u201d he says, with a smile. \u201cI had the shock of my life. I used to get it very easy as a junior, turning up to games and playing without any training. But at St Helens, we didn\u2019t see a rugby ball for the first month I was contracted full-time. The first time I did a gym session I couldn\u2019t lift my arms for days after. Having never done any training before at any age level, that was probably the biggest shock of all. Thankfully Mum told me to stick at it and I\u2019m glad I did.\u201d Further accolades could come Grace\u2019s way before the year\u2019s end, too, with the winger tipped for a place in the Great Britain squad that will tour the southern hemisphere this autumn. Following on from Billy Boston and Jonathan Davies as Welshmen to have represented the Lions is a feat not lost on Grace. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens there, but it\u2019s mad,\u201d he says. \u201cI could have gone down the conventional route and tried union like everyone else but I\u2019m glad I took the risk.\u201d Could he ever return to his first love of rugby union? \u201cI\u2019m really enjoying this, more than I ever thought I would,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the moment I\u2019m very happy and I\u2019ve never actually looked at going back. My mum gets mad when I call St Helens home but after five years ... it does feel like it now.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
