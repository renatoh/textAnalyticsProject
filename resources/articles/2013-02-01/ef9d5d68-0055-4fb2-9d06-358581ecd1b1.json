At 500ft long and 33ft wide that adds up to $25,000 \u2013 still cheaper than padding the corridor with new towels. That's the Academy's only concession to austerity. The Hollywood Reporter's number-crunching \"Oscarnomics\" team estimates that the 488 Marc Friedland-designed laminated, hand-folded, gold-leaf-stamped, embossed nominee cards cost a total of $10,000. Only 24 \u2013 bearing the winners' names \u2013 will actually be revealed on stage. Leaves a lot of very posh stationery for recycling. Host Seth MacFarlane's fee is estimated at $15\u2013$25,000. Interesting to see whether Seth or the carpet will prove better value. \u2022\u2009LA's beauty salons are working flat out to transform clients young and old into porcelain Desdemonas. Stylists from Juan Juan Salon start making house calls at dawn, with a $500 minimum. Some salons charge up to $1,200 for a facial which includes \"red carpet oxygen treatment\". Boosts collagen, aids in elastin synthesis formation and destroys bacteria, says the tin. Actors who have been starving themselves to fit into frocks and tuxedos, and who are planning to shun grub lest they bloat, are in for a cruel night. Wolfgang Puck is mixing five kilos of white truffles from Alba, Italy, into chestnut tortellini. To be followed by Snake River Farm steak, Japanese matsutake mushrooms and 500 kilos of Guittard bittersweet chocolate, all washed down with Napa Valley reserve cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay and three types of champagne, Thienot brut, Thienot ros\u00e9, Thienot vintage. Burp. \u2022\u2009These are the 85th Academy Awards, but hush, don't say that too loud lest you frighten the kids. Worried about alienating MTV-generation viewers, about three weeks ago the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences purged all mention of the Academy Awards, and its age, to brand the event solely as the Oscars. The whole AA/tradition/anniversary thing was \"mired somewhat in a musty way\", explained the show's co-producer, Neil Meron. It will be the most musical show for many years, with Jennifer Hudson and Catherine Zeta-Jones respectively belting out numbers from Dreamgirls and Chicago. Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, Russell Crowe and Helena Bonham Carter are expected to reprise songs from Les Mis\u00e9rables. \u2022\u2009An anonymous member of the Academy's directing branch confides to THR his elimination process in selecting best film. \"I'm putting Amour at No 9 because I'm just pissed off at that film. Beasts of the Southern Wild is a movie that I just didn't understand, so that's my No 8. Les Mis\u00e9rables goes in seventh place \u2026 the most disappointing film in many years. Above that I'm putting Silver Linings Playbook, which is just a \"blah\" film. Django Unchained will go into my fifth slot \u2013 it's a fun movie, but it's basically just Quentin Tarantino masturbating. Next up is Life of Pi because of how unique it is and for holding my attention up until its irritating ending. Argo is gonna go in third place, but I don't want it to win because I don't think it deserves to win and am annoyed that it is on track to win for the wrong reasons. I'm basically OK with one of two films winning. Lincoln is going in my second slot; it's a bore, but it's Spielberg, it's well-meaning, and it's important. Zero Dark Thirty is my No 1.\" \u2022 The marketing firm Distinctive Assets will hand out its traditional swag bags, valued at more than $45,000, to nominees who lose. Goodies include trips to Australia, Hawaii and Mexico, personal training sessions, condoms, tequila, hand-illustrated tennis shoes, appointments for injectable fillers, \"portion-controlled\" dinnerware, acupuncture and aromatherapy sessions, a voucher for a fitness and weight-loss retreat and one-year membership to Heathrow's VIP service. When the bagless winners start weeping on the podium, you'll know why."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
