I rarely, if ever, venture through the doors of emporiums that front the experience with garden tat and follow through with off-the-peg plants which have been produced in the equivalent of battery farms. I find them depressing. It's like visiting a supermarket rather than a market, where you can talk to the suppliers and get a sense of what's in season and where it came from. A \"real\" nursery is a treasure trove of inspiration. A place to pick the owner's brains, and there is nothing like talking to the people who grow the plants to give you sales assurance. Tastes and appetites and experience are evident in the best, and looking at the owner's collection you can see the world through another set of eyes. Phoenix Perennial Plants near Alton in Hampshire was on my list earlier in the year. I went there with the express desire to purchase Centranthus lecoqii, the lilac form of valerian, which I saw this year at the Chelsea Flower Show. Marina Christopher, who is as much into wildlife as she is her eclectic collection of plants, is a true naturalist, and the stock beds are overgrown with self-seeders. A white Herb Robert I'd never encountered and tall stands of pale Oenothera stricta \"Sulphurea\" jumped the rows of sale plants and I came away with a new Geranium sanguineum called \"Tiny Monster\", which is anything but. We talked plants for the best part of an hour, Marina pointing me to North American prairie perennials I had seen near Chicago but never here, and I left with a head full of thoughts, a carful of booty. Though considerably less woolly, the nursery at Great Dixter offers a similar experience, and it is special for the fact that you can come away with something you might have seen and coveted in the garden moments before. Visiting such places you will encounter plants that have yet to hit the market but are ready to enter the zeitgeist. Erigeron annuus, which head gardener Fergus Garrett is mixing into Great Dixter's borders, is a case in point. I have put this tall fleabane among the fennel and clary sage at the front of the house. Derry Watkins, owner of Derry Watkins Nursery in the Cotswolds, is mad about plants, and you can see this in her ever-evolving collection. The nursery, small, compact and overflowing, spills almost imperceptibly into Derry's garden, which billows downhill and away below the house. In contrast to a bigger retail outlet, you are immediately put on the right foot with a display of treasures by the gate. Stock plants, with labels warning they are not for sale, sit among neatly potted seedlings which are. Derry likes a treasure, and her taste in plants is good, so you know that even when something isn't in flower it would be worth a try. The Linaria \"Peachy\" is a good example of a \"blind\" purchase I made there this time last year. \"Peachy\" is a new plant to me, with flowers of a soft rose-orange spearing above grey-blue foliage. I can see my tastes evolving through this being the nursery on my doorstep. Fringed \"Elizabethan\" dianthus and jewel-coloured salvias will like my south-facing position, and her collection of annuals is terribly tempting to a man in a new garden with no bones yet on which to hang anything. The Silene armeria \"Electra\", which has dazzled me for a month, is testament to that. I bought it in bud because it was already showing promise, and it has been delighting me since with a violence of colour that has lifted this grey summer. Many of these specialist nurseries have their own websites, and if you are not able to make the journey you can often order direct. This is true of Special Plants, which dispatches seed in the post. But it is always worth the effort to get out and see for yourself. Take it from me: it is invariably a fast track in the education of a gardener."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
