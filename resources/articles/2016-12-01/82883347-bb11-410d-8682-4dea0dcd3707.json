Warnings about Australia\u2019s triple A credit rating from the ratings agency Standard and Poors (S&amp;P) showed the need to raise more revenue as well as cut spending, Bowen said. But the treasurer, Scott Morrison, said he refused to give Labor and others a \u201cleave pass\u201d on the $13.2bn of unlegislated \u201czombie\u201d savings that have not passed parliament, some of which date back to the 2014 budget. Asked whether Australia could afford the government\u2019s $48bn 10-year company tax cut plan, Morrison told ABC radio there were \u201ctwin challenges\u201d: reducing the deficit and growing the economy. \u201cYou don\u2019t grow the economy by taxing it more and you don\u2019t grow the economy by increasing the deficit by your own decisions,\u201d he said. Morrison said Labor would have increased the deficit by $16.5bn over four years, even after scrapping the company tax cut plan. On Radio National, Bowen said Labor would have built in structural changes, including limiting negative gearing tax concessions, increasing capital gains tax and reforming the vocational loan system. Asked if the deficit would have been worse in the short term, Bowen agreed the structural measures would not have had a major impact in the 2016-17 fiscal year, but revenue and savings would \u201cbuild over time\u201d. Bowen said Labor had a realistic path to surplus because it was \u201cnot relying on things that won\u2019t pass the parliament\u201d. He said the purported $16bn gap between Labor and the government\u2019s plan was built on assumptions that job seekers would be forced to wait for Newstart and people would be forced to wait until they were 70 to get the pension, two measures blocked by parliament. Ratings agencies would look at both the four-year and 10-year plan and he was \u201cvery confident\u201d they would accept Labor\u2019s path to surplus was more believable. \u201cThey\u2019ve made it very clear the projected return to surplus in 2020-21 is key to them,\u201d he said. The government\u2019s projected surplus in 2021 projected in the mid-year economic and fiscal update was \u201cwafer thin and would be blown over in a breeze.\u201d Bowen said S&amp;P was pessimistic about Australia\u2019s triple A rating and required not just the successful passage of measures already announced but new revenue measures in particular. Morrison said the government had passed $22bn of budget savings in seven parliamentary sitting weeks and would \u201ccontinue to look for partners\u201d to pass the remaining $13.2bn of savings. He would not let parliament and Labor \u201coff the hook\u201d or give them a \u201cleave pass\u201d. \u201cThese are important changes ... I\u2019m very persistent and very determined to get budget back into balance,\u201d he said. Asked about further savings in next year\u2019s budget, Morrison said it would \u201caddress many issues\u201d and \u201cthat work has already begun\u201d. Labor had \u201cmade an art form\u201d of predicting surpluses that could blow over in the breeze, referring to the former Labor treasurer Wayne Swan\u2019s prediction of a slim $1bn surplus in 2013 that was knocked over not by a breeze but \u201ca hurricane\u201d. Morrison said $7.8bn savings booked in the Myefo for lower childcare costs was due to better modelling of growth in costs and shutting down \u201crorts\u201d causing massive growth in family daycare rebates. Morrison said extending the tax cut, particularly to companies with up to $10m turnover, would give them more head room to increase workers\u2019 hours or invest in equipment to expand their businesses. Labor supports a company tax cut only for companies with turnover less than $2m. Bowen said treasury modelling showed the $48bn tax cut package would boost the economy by only 1% over 20 years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
