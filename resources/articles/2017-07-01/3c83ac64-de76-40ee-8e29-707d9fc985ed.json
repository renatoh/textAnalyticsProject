Last season\u2019s Grand Finalists knew anything other than victory here would consign them to this summer\u2019s Qualifiers, where they would face the Championship\u2019s best sides in a battle to avoid relegation to the second tier. And while this victory may prove only temporary respite \u2013 a win for Huddersfield on Friday night would confirm their bottom-four place \u2013 this was a welcome victory for Tony Smith\u2019s side. \u201cHe [Currie] was terrific, whether he scored or not,\u201d Smith said of the forward, who had suffered a serious knee injury playing against Wigan last September. For Wigan, a night supposed to be a celebration for their talismanic captain ended in frustration. Back-to-back victories had ended their worst winless run since 1903 but this was a worrying regression for the Super League champions, who could end the weekend six points adrift of the top four with eight games left. \u201cI\u2019m really disappointed and the players all know that,\u201d said the Wigan coach, Shaun Wane. \u201cIt was a massive game but I didn\u2019t see the desperation in them.\u201d Wigan had taken the lead after little over a minute. Warrington made a mess of the kick-off and, from it, Oliver Gildart touched down a pinpoint Thomas Leuluai kick. At that stage it looked as if it would be a comfortable night for Wigan but tries from Benjamin Jullien and Ryan Atkins either side of John Bateman\u2019s for Wigan kept Warrington in touch at half-time with the home side leading 10-8. There were only eight points in the second half and all of them went to the visitors. Currie\u2019s crucial try put the Wolves ahead for the first time before Stefan Ratchford kicked two late penalties.
