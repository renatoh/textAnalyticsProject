The unlikely threesome will be getting together to celebrate the welcoming of Slovenia and Cyprus into the EU fold on May 1, along with Hungary, Malta, Slovakia, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, the Czech Republic and Poland. It promises to be something of a surreal event and for guidance about the finer details of diplomatic functions, there can be few better independent authorities than Elizabeth Stewart, the editor of Diplomat magazine. \"I've been called the Ferrero Rocher woman but I've never actually ever seen any at a diplomatic event,\" she says - and she has been to plenty. \"They can vary in quality. Sometimes there are piles of very good food ... and there can be good entertainment.\" But there is always the risk of finding yourself bored and making small talk to some former general. And if you are in a party mood, be warned that events at some Middle East embassies will not have alcohol. Stewart says tonight's Foreign Office bash for 250 people from the \"accession diaspora\" is likely to be bit more showbiz than the normal diplomatic function, however, and the champagne will be flowing. The FO said the unconfirmed guest list includes Estonian supermodel Carmen Kass, the Easyjet founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who was born in Athens to Cypriot parents, and the Hollywood actress Rachel Weisz, who is half Hungarian. \"I've never seen Rachel Weisz at a Hungarian event before,\" Stewart says, \"but I suppose that Downing Street has more pull.\" She adds that tonight will be a big event for the ambassadors of the accession countries. \"It's a nice thing for Downing Street to do for them,\" she says. They will feel like they have finally arrived. From now on, she says, she expects the time it takes them to arrange a meeting with foreign secretary Jack Straw will be cut, and there have been signs of them already indicating that they now have more weight to throw around. The accession has also prompted a round of celebrations and a events in London hosted by the different ambassadors. \"There was a Hungary one recently ... and [education secretary] Charles Clarke's wife is Estonian, so he was at their party.\" Regardless that the star wattage may be slightly higher tonight, Stewart says that the form will probably be the same. \"The guests will come in and be greeted by the foreign secretary, Jack Straw, and maybe Blair. Sometimes there is a toastmaster, although the Foreign Office are more modern about that kind of thing these days.\" The guests will then mingle either side of the speeches and any entertainment. \"There'll be canap\u00e9s and people serving champagne, wine or fruit juices,\" Stewart says. But will Peter Andre be able to get a beer? \"Maybe not. The Belgians and Germans are good at serving beer but he may struggle tonight,\" she says. Such events vary in their usefulness. Stewart says: \"In the run-up to the accession you would see a clique of the ambassadors from the 10 new countries together talking - they probably found it quite useful. \"In the main, though, the events become a lot livelier ahead of a war. Before the Afghanistan and Iraq invasions you would be more likely to see the US ambassador making a point of going round the room speaking to people from different countries.\" For outsiders the events can be intimidating, she says, but most of the diplomats present will be veterans of the canap\u00e9s circuit. In general, Stewart says that you usually get more Tories than Labour people at diplomatic events. \"It's funny but you always seem to see [shadow foreign secretary] Michael Ancram. He's a bit like Tara Parker-Tomkinson.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
