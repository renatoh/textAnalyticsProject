Emo Philips is a pith artist, really. He tells semi-surreal jokes so short and sharp that they make the audience jolt as well as laugh. Those who see the Chicagoan play the Edinburgh fringe this month will get plenty of proof of this, but many of his gags are known by people who have never heckled a stand-up in their lives. This is bound to have turned up in more than a few inboxes: \"I ran three miles today, and finally I said, 'Lady take your purse.'\" After winning his first major success in the 80s, Philips was often dubbed an alternative comedian, but his jokes are much cleverer, cleaner and funnier than that term suggests. He is the elder statesman of the one-liner : \"I think my ex-wife had weekly lessons with the devil on how to be more evil. I don't know how much she charged him.\" Indeed, his comedic style could easily feature on Radio 4 (you might say it already does, so many British comics have ripped him off). His jokes are often informed by a sense of cosmic injustice that means all people are cursed with rotten luck. Rather than get angry about it, the Philips way is to coin cheery one-liners. \"I saw an old woman changing a flat tyre, and I walked right by, like everybody else,\" goes one classic. \"Then I thought what kind of person am I? So I went back and said, 'Have a nice day.'\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
