Here is a more traditionally English way of serving it. Serves 4 vegetable oil 12 sage leaves salt and freshly ground white pepper 4 small lettuces, Cos or Baby Gem carrot, celeriac, onion and celery stalk, peeled and finely diced 25g unsalted butter 250ml veal stock 8 very thin slices streaky bacon plain flour 4 x 150g thin slices calf's liver 4 portions pomme pur\u00e9e 1. Deep-fry the sage leaves in hot vegetable oil, then drain well on kitchen paper. Season with a little salt. 2. Make the braised lettuce: halve the lettuces and blanch them quickly in boiling salted water, then refresh in cold water and drain well. Sweat the vegetable dice in the butter until they colour. Place the lettuce and diced vegetables in a pot and add the stock and some seasoning. Bring to the boil, cover, and braise for 10 to 15 minutes until tender. 3. Lightly grill the bacon without colouring. 4. Season and flour the liver, dusting off any excess. Pan-fry in 100ml hot oil until pink, a minute or so on each side depending on the thickness. 5. To serve, place the liver on a heap of braised lettuce, with two slices of bacon on top , and decorate with the sage. Serve with pomme pur\u00e9e. \u00b7 This recipe was taken from The Mirabelle Cookbook, Ebury Press."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
