A wonderful win for Bangladesh, and a nice place to leave it. Farewell. \u201coutside, the monsoon in full elemental glory lashing it down on dhaka. season of mango, lychee, jackfruit, jam in full flow. our golden generation of shakib, tamim, mushfiq, and mashrafe on display. a nation of 160 million glued to the tv. it doesn\u2019t get better than this. in the 70s and 80s we gave our love to the west indies, like we did with mohammad ali and pele. the irony isn\u2019t lost on the older generation (with 60% of population under 30). i don\u2019t have a tv but following scoring through the cheers and lulls of the streets. bangla joi!\u201d Here are the updated standings, with Bangladesh just outside the finals position. Jason Holder has some relatively obvious thoughts on what went wrong: \u201cNot enough runs.\u201d Well, yes. \u201cWe never got going as we should have through the middle overs. If you score 320 here you\u2019ve got to fight really hard through the middle overs to defend it, and there were a couple of chances we missed. We tried to hit the top of the stumps but we were just too inconsistent. Having said that. we can\u2019t dwell on it. We\u2019ve got another game to play, and from here everything is a final for us.\u201d And the Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Mortaza. \u201cWe said yesterday that there is still a chance to go, but we have to win all matches. My knees were a bit hurting, but we had enough bowlers to keep going. I think the turning moment was Mustafizur taking wickets. Hetmyer and then Russell in two overs to get them out. \u201cShakib did somethign really exceptional, and hopefully the other boys can join him. In the last two matches Mushy batted so well, today Tamim and Soumya batted well. Liton Das, normally he opens or bats at three, so it\u2019s good for him to get a chance for us and he delivered.\" \u201cI am loving following this match. What a joy Bangladesh are,\u201d writes Charlie Jeffery. \u201cWas wondering if they had played Australia yet? To echo someone else it\u2019s such a shame that the Windies are falling away like Steve Finn falling into the stumps. We need upsets though against the fatter teams.PS: I love listening to the Final Word too, even if there is some Oz stuff I just don\u2019t understand.\u201d Couldn\u2019t agree more about the joy. They play Australia on Thursday at Trent Bridge, and I\u2019ll be there bringing you the OBO as ever. As for the last comment, it is true that sometimes our podcast is mystifyingly Australian for some listeners, but we like to bring an exotic streak to lives around the world. Player of the match: Shakib al Hasan. No surprises there. Joel Garner awards the trophy. \u201cIt feels great. I\u2019ve been working on my batting for the last month and a half and it\u2019s paid off. I thought it was a team effort to restrict the West Indies, and I was confident we could make it work. \u201cI know that if I bat at No3 I\u2019ll get more opportunities, more time to bat. I know that if I bat at No5 then I come in at the 30th or 40th over and that\u2019s not ideal for me. So I asked to change. \u201cI think I\u2019m doing ok with the ball, but I can get certainly better. It will be tough next game, especially playing for Australia who are at the peak of their form so we\u2019ll have to bring our A game. Thanks to our supporters who have been there travelling for us, it\u2019s so good to have this support in this World Cup.\u201d 41.3 overs: Bangladesh 322-3 (Shakib 124, Das 94) Pulled for four! And that will finish things off \u2013 both this match, and the West Indies\u2019 World Cup campaign. Fittingly Liton Das hits the boundary, and fittingly it\u2019s a pull. The batsmen have taken on the short ball today and triumphed. When that didn\u2019t work, West Indies ran out of ideas. It was all pace today, on a good batting strip that didn\u2019t offer much except enough bounce to take the ball over the keeper on occasion. Their lone spinner Ashley Nurse didn\u2019t play, and Chris Gayle\u2019s attempt to fill in was unsuccessful in fairly spectacular fashion. 41st over: Bangladesh 316-3 (Shakib 124, Das 88) It\u2019s party time at the Liton Das Ranch House. He strides forward at Holder and laces the first ball of the over through extra cover, then leans back and carves a cut shot over backward point. A couple more boundaries as Bangladesh career towards history. 40th over: Bangladesh 305-3 (Shakib 123, Das 78) Gabriel continues, because there\u2019s no point changing really. The West Indies have given up. And there\u2019s no need for Bangladesh to attack, so the batsmen just work a few runs around to go past 300. \u201cIs there a player in the history of the format that has achieved such incredible statistical feats with less attention?\u201d asks Matthew Potter of Shakib al Hasan. \u201cIf he had achieved for those figures for, say, India, would he not be consistently talked about as an all time great already? I do think this will be realised by more people on reflection, but his consistency has been remarkable in a team who have often been less than remarkable.\u201d I can\u2019t argue with that. It tends to take team wins for players\u2019 feats to be really recognised. But there\u2019ll be a lot of respect for this knock today, given it\u2019s going to lead to an important win. 39th over: Bangladesh 299-3 (Shakib 119, Das 76) Suddenly Bangladesh only need 28 off 12 overs. It doesn\u2019t help when Liton Das smashes a drive straight back at Cottrell and the bowler can\u2019t hang on while trying to preserve his own safety. It helps even less when he follows up with a ball on leg stump that Das glances for four. 38th over: Bangladesh 294-3 (Shakib 118, Das 72) Shannon Gabriel to bowl, striding in to Liton Das. Short, not much bounce though, and it\u2019s pulled away for six! Solid shot, great connection, and it flies well in front of square, into the midwicket crowd. Sweet sound from the first ball of the over. The second, Gabriel pitches up. Das guesses that he will, shuffles away a touch to make some room, and lofts him for six more! Over long off that time, another clean strike and it flies away. Third ball, and IT\u2019S SIX! Bouncer again, middle stump line, but Das moves the other way, steps inside the line of the ball and hooks it over fine leg! What a streak. Will he go for four? No, he\u2019ll play sensibly and drive the wide yorker for one. But Shakib follows up by nicking Gabriel fine for four. Then driving a single. The over goes for 24! This pair could have won Pakistan\u2019s five-over resumption against India last night, at this rate. 37th over: Bangladesh 270-3 (Shakib 113, Das 53) The required rate is down to 4 an over. Cottrell comes in and... bowls a wide. First ball of the over. A couple of dots follow, then has Shakib miscuing but landing safe before it reaches mid-on. So there\u2019s a vestige of pressure, which is then placed on the barbeque and torched when Cottrell bowls a leg-stump half volley for Shakib to clip behind square for four. 36th over: Bangladesh 264-3 (Shakib 109, Das 52) More nervous moments for Bangladesh, as Shakib miscues Thomas back over the bowler, the ball hanging for a long time before landing between mid-on and mid-off. He gets away with it and gets two runs. A couple more wides follow. They\u2019ve been a plague on this match for the Caribbean side. And from the re-bowl - the sixth delivery that has taken three attempts to land - Shakib drives four through long-on. 24 wides today! Bangladesh need 58 from 84. Imagine taking 24 runs from them and four overs off the balls remaining. Toby Sims is in misery. \u201cI\u2019m very much in two minds about this match - I love the West Indies (Jason Holder is a talisman for both them and the game) but I can\u2019t help really wanting Bangladesh to pull this off. Not only for the lesser spotted run chase above 300, but also because of their passion and tenacity (see also Afghanistan). On tenterhooks for both sides, it\u2019s a nightmare!\u201d 35th over: Bangladesh 253-3 (Shakib 101, Das 51) Cottrell tries again. A brace, a couple of singles. The 250 comes up, as does a fifty for Liton Das. He\u2019s been terrific too, taking his time and then motoring along once set, supporting his senior player. Between them they\u2019ve reduced the deficite to 69. Nice. \u201cMy second team is generally whichever side is chasing. Partly because we\u2019re yet to see a really epic run chase in the World Cup (go on, Bangladesh!), but mainly because I just find it entertaining. The psychology of weighing up the risk/reward of batting in a chase is one of my favourite things in sport. (Full disclosure: part of my job involves writing risk assessments. I\u2019m not an interesting person.)\u201d You might be about to see one, Matthew Dony. Then you can reward yourself with a big bowl of plain brown rice and a peruse of the latest Excel formulas. 34th over: Bangladesh 248-3 (Shakib 100, Das 47) Liton Das miscues down to third man for a boundary, then gets off strike. Shakib doesn\u2019t miscue though, from the last ball. He drives Thomas gloriously through cover to raise the milestone! That\u2019s a great get for the highlight reel. Shakib\u2019s second hundred at this World Cup, and he joins a select group of batsmen to achieve that sort of feat. He\u2019s done it quickly, and put his team in pole position to win this match. Some luck, but intent to score as soon as he came in, unlike his England hundred where he looked to be trying to limit any net run rate damage. He was a matchwinner with the bat against South Africa, and could be here. 33rd over: Bangladesh 238-3 (Shakib 95, Das 42) He\u2019s Liton fire! With Shakib maybe growing a bit pensive while close to a century, as batsmen are wont to do, Das is growing in confidence and taking on the responsbility. He gets a short ball from Thomas, with enough width to swing, and just opens the blade to the sky and uppercuts it for six! Short straight boundaries at Taunton. Then two more runs in the same direction along the ground. Jack Jorgensen emails in. \u201cI never imagined myself doing so (too many nightmares about the All Blacks, and jokes about someone\u2019s under-arm) but I find myself backing the Kiwis as my second horse, as an Australian. I love watching Kane bat, and saw part of Ross Taylor\u2019s epic at the WACA a few years back, which bumped up my estimation of his skills. The Big Man / Big House / Dutchie has the poshest name in the tournament. The first name game in the squad is strong as well - two Colins, a Henry, a Martin - almost like a team of history teachers / accountants. Plus they seem to have gotten their balance correct as well, with two decent spinners in Sodhi and Santner, a great pace attack, and a good spread of batting. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how far they get.\u201d 32nd over: Bangladesh 228-3 (Shakib 94, Das 33) The Gayle Experiment is proving costly for West Indies. They have to find two more overs to fill in Russell\u2019s allotment. Gayle may not be the answer. Because Liton Das plays his first shot in anger, skipping down and chipping four over midwicket one ball after that outfielder was moved to square leg. Shakib carves out to deep cover and only a dive keeps him to two, then Das makes room and goes out through cover himself, on the right-hander\u2019s side of the ground, driving four more. Lovely batting, 13 from the over, and their deficit is under 100 now. They need 94 from 18 overs. 31st over: Bangladesh 215-3 (Shakib 92, Das 23) Liton Das gets lucky, skewing Holder over mid-on. Thomas wasn\u2019t right back on the ring, where he might have been tall enough to take it. Those moments have gone against West Indies today. But he\u2019s doing his job, rotating strike, and running hard when Shakib wants a fast two to the midwicket sweeper, making sure they both get home safe. No intensity from West Indies in the field though. Take a wicket and they can definitely still win this, they just don\u2019t look like they believe that. Shakib has gone back to being top run-scorer at this World Cup. He\u2019s passed Aaron Finch\u2019s 343, and done it from one fewer innings. 30th over: Bangladesh 210-3 (Shakib 89, Das 21) Captain Jason Holder is racing in the Desperation Stakes at the moment. Chris Gayle comes on for a bowl. He\u2019s a walk-up start in this team, literally. Uses his height to lob a ball down with reasonable effect. Single, dot, single, landing them alright. Then he bowls another set of five wides. Fifteen runs in such mistakes, and 22 wides in all, from the West Indies bowlers today. Gayle drags it down, always a risk for the less frequent bowler, and Hope can\u2019t get across to take enough off it. May have got a touch, but not enough to slow it sufficiently. Three more singles. An over worth 10. Bangladesh only need 5.6 an over, and are going at 6.95. Stirring stuff. 29th over: Bangladesh 200-3 (Shakib 87, Das 18) Top edge again from Shakib! Tries to pull Holder, and the angle of lift undoes him as it has so many batsmen. But the miscue flies high over the keeper and lands safely to drop and bounce for four. There\u2019s a third-umpire review when Liton Das dives in for a single, but he makes it on Shakib\u2019s call. Then his own single raises the 200. \u201cAbhijato\u2019s tie-breaker suggestion (over 20) is logical, but could be seen as overly bureaucratic,\u201d writes Edmund King. What a worldwide cricket audience surely wants to witness is heart-stoppingly unpredictable live action. How about taking a leaf out of football\u2019s book, but instead of a penalty shootout, asking members of the rival XIs to competitively perform a task against the clock? Exo-planet detection. Harpsichord tuning. If cricket wants to survive, its premier competition needs to embrace bold visions.\u201d Maybe one of those super-jock American college-boy trick-shot YouTube challenges, like trying to throw a Frisbee into a keg of beer from the back of a moving pick-up truck? 28th over: Bangladesh 192-3 (Shakib 81, Das 16) What was that! Excuse me, I\u2019ll have... hmm... a back-foot on-drive punch for four please. I\u2019m sorry sir, we can\u2019t make custom dishes. Shakib has played a wondrous shot to Gabriel. Who then loses his line and delivers a pie, outside leg and glanced for four. Deflated, Gabriel bowls a short ball that doesn\u2019t get up, just served on a plate on off stump. Shakib slaps the short-arm pull shot for four! And 13 from the over. The required rate is under 6 per over. 27th over: Bangladesh 179-3 (Shakib 68, Das 16) Oh, Shakib. He grows ruder and ruder. Faces up to Captain Jason Holder and just slaps him back down the ground for four. Length ball, full swing. They\u2019re going at 6.7 an over and they need 6.1 from here. An awful lot of runs still to get though. Nick Parish emails in. \u201cHearing about Russell\u2019s tumbles inevitably brings to my mind my favourite Terry Pratchett lines. Why are you kicking Andre Russell while he\u2019s down, Shakib al Hasan? Safest way, sir! Well, it was certainly something like that.\u201d 26th over: Bangladesh 172-3 (Shakib 62, Das 15) Gabriel offers yet another wide in this over, as Shakib and Das keep collecting singles.Only four players have done the 6000 runs and 200 wickets in one-dayers: Afridi, Jayasuriya, Kallis and now Shakib. And our man has done it faster than any of them, in 202 matches. \u201cGenuine question about NRR but don\u2019t laugh at me.\u201d George. I would never laugh at anyone from South Slough. \u201cIf a team get bowled out for 100 in 10 overs then is their run rate 10? Being bowled out for 100 in 10 overs would normally be considered quite poor but is it good for NRR purposes? If they were chasing 200 scored over 50 overs then would they lose the match but do well on NRR?\u201d In a fit of heroic honesty, I have to admit that I\u2019ve never been good at understanding net run rate, or Duckworth Lewis Stern. I just believe what the stattos tell me. But I\u2019m pretty sure the deal is that your run rate is spread across 50 overs if bowled out, or replicated across 50 if you\u2019re chasing. So bowled out for 100 in 10 overs is the same as not out making 100 in 50 overs. Run rate of 2 per over. But a winning chase of 100 in 10 overs would be treated as 500 in 50 overs, at 10 per over. Hence the huge gaps when NZ and West Indies bowled out Sri Lanka and Pakistan quickly, then chased quickly. 25th over: Bangladesh 166-3 (Shakib 60, Das 12) Liton Das keeps going well, knocking those ones. Russell tries the short ball to Shakib and beats his attempted uppercut. So he looks to finish the over with another one to Das, but this one clears the keeper for five wides. The second time that\u2019s happened in the innings, and it takes the wides total to 16. The extra delivery is a dot ball, and now comes the traditional Russell limp from the field after six overs. Both Brian Withington and my colleage Tom Bryant have been reminded by Cottrell of this gem from Roger Harper. 24th over: Bangladesh 157-3 (Shakib 58, Das 10) He\u2019s doing this nicely, Liton Das. Finding the singles when he gets on strike. Gabriel bowls a good over that only goes for four. There\u2019s another sniff of a run out but nothing eventuates from it. In honour of Cottrell\u2019s effort, here\u2019s our Joy of Six on the topic. 23rd over: Bangladesh 153-3 (Shakib 56, Das 8) Russell, bowling his fifth over. Has only fallen over once, as far as I can tell. No accurate count on how many knee-rubs he\u2019s done. His pace is down to the 85mph/135kph area. Comes around the wicket at Shakib to bounce him, but Shakib ducks, shimmies, tucks. Finally he takes on the bouncer and top edges it, miles into the air. Hope is running back towards the boundary but can\u2019t quite get there. Gabriel was running off the fence at fine leg and probably could have, but saw Hope coming and wanted to avoid a collision. The ball drops into the metre of space between them, like a high-platform circus artist into a washtub. Plop. Shakib survives. Gets a run. Russell bowls to Liton Das. Who tonks him through midwicket for four. Russell hits the deck again, and stays down a while. It\u2019s safer down there. 22nd over: Bangladesh 146-3 (Shakib 54, Das 3) Shakib is starting to live dangerously, perhaps feeling the pressure to keep the innings moving. He lofts to deep square leg and the ball bounces just short of Hetmyer. Later in the over he mistimes to chip over the bowler, landing safely. The singles come, but it\u2019s dicey stuff. He needs to bat long. 21st over: Bangladesh 141-3 (Shakib 51, Das 1) Finally Shakib gives up the bowling, and Liton Das eases a single to third man first ball. Not so easy later in the over, as he gets tangled up against Russell several balls in a row. The good news for Bangladesh is that Shakib\u2019s first single raises his fifty, meaning he now has 75, 64, 121, and 51* in this World Cup. 20th over: Bangladesh 138-3 (Shakib 49, Das 0) Liton Das is next in. Not much of a record to speak of. 24 years of age. He gets to watch from the far end as Shakib negotiates a tricky Cottrell over, before lofting a straight ball down the ground to beat Captain Jason Holder into the rope. Shakib pinches the strike from the final ball. Abhijato Sensarma has a proposal. \u201cWe can replace NRR as a tie-breaker in tournaments such as the World Cup with the team\u2019s official ODI rankings (on the day the qualification is locked for the event) serving as the judging point instead. If multiple teams end up with the same number of points, the higher ranked team gets the higher position on the tournament table. This serves a dual role since it is a fairer method than using the NRR, and contextualises bilateral games too! Your thoughts?\u201d I think the main issue is that the ranking uses results from two years ago, but would decide positions in a tournament. One of the joys of knockout play is that a team can shake off its past and emerge anew. So a side that has a brilliant run and trounces several good opponents could be ranked behind a side that scraped by each match, if they\u2019re level on points. 19th over: Bangladesh 133-3 (Shakib 44) Well, well, well. That over was, to be frank, an island of floating trash. Short, wide, two balls slapped away by Shakib to the fence, another so wide it was called by the umpire. But when the final ball goes the other side of the stumps, it draws the lucky dismissal. Thomas has had some impressive moments during this Cup, and that bit of good luck might fire him up to replicate them. There\u2019s your answer - no he can\u2019t. One of those nothing dismissals, to end a poor Thomas over, but the last ball drags down leg and Mushy gets a touch on it as he tries to glance. He throws his head back as the finger goes up, knowing that he\u2019s no chance of surviving a review. 18th over: Bangladesh 121-2 (Shakib 34, Mushfiqur 0) A stroke of luck and brilliance for the West Indies, and that\u2019s the kind of thing that can often derail a batting side. The vastly experienced Mushfiqur Rahim comes to the middle. Can he combine with Shakib as they\u2019ve done so many times? Incredible piece of fielding. Direct hit from Cottrell, with maybe a stump and a half to aim at around Tamim\u2019s body, and he does for Tamim by an inch. So often you see bowlers feigning to throw down the striker\u2019s stumps after fielding the ball. Normally it\u2019s just a charade. But this time Tamim had come a step down the wicket to play the ball, and another step to catch his balance. He dug out the full ball back to Cottrell, who picked it up fluidly and fired down the stumps in one move. Tamim was diving back but was short. Cottrell took maybe the catch of the tournament against Australia, and now this. Right up there with a couple of run-outs that Isuru Udana effected from his own bowling for Sri Lanka against Australia as well. 17th over: Bangladesh 119-1 (Tamim 47, Shakib 33) Bang! The over after drinks can often bring a wicket, but this time it brings the shot of the day. Thomas bounces Shakib, and the Bangladeshi cleans up on the pull shot, absolutely nailing it square for four. 16th over: Bangladesh 112-1 (Tamim 47, Shakib 27) Bangladesh take a breather with the drinks break approach, just knocking Gabriel around. There\u2019s no spin option for West Indies today aside from Gayle, who these days sends the ball down about as venomously as he walks to the crease to deliver it. \u201cO Jason, my Jason,\u201d is how Guy Hornsby prefaces his email - very good. \u201cLike Alastair, I\u2019m lucky enough to be going to Old Trafford on Saturday (and tomorrow) and I was looking forward to it being a win-or-bust for either team. Sadly Windies\u2019 promise has been deflated by injuries and form, and the nagging feeling they can\u2019t keep at full wallop for fifty overs at the moment. It\u2019s a real shame, given the youngsters in the squad. Surely though, as England have found, this World Cup is going to be about the squad because playing so many group games is attritional. I hope Roy &amp; Morgan heal, but it\u2019s no bad thing if Vince and Dawson play either. Thoughts, OBO faithful?\u201d It would be certainly great for those two on a personal level to get a game, and feel like they\u2019ve properly been part of the tournament. 15th over: Bangladesh 108-1 (Tamim 46, Shakib 24) Thomas finds some control: singles, and a two down fine towards third man. With that brace, Shakib brings up his 6000th one-day run. Eight centuries there at 37, and the small matter of 252 wickets as well with his spin. 14th over: Bangladesh 103-1 (Tamim 44, Shakib 21) Slip is gone, third man is back finer. He fields a couple of singles, before Gabriel drops short and Tamim batters him through cover with a flat bat. Boundary. The run rate is 7.34, and they only need 6.08 from here. A few more brisk overs could lay this out on a platter for Bangladesh. \u201cAt the risk of further inflating my already burgeoning anti-nationalist cred,\u201d writes Abhinav Dutta, who must have been up to something that we should probably know about, \u201cI have consistently been rooting for the West Indies for some time now and can\u2019t help but admire the Pakistanis when they get their act together. In spite of India boasting a really strong team I find them to be more more efficient than thrilling.\u201d \u201cBut with the Windies and Pakistanis, it\u2019s like a bipolar dimension. One moment magical and the very next farcical. I gather that sustained sporting success is not for me. Instead it\u2019s more of a masochistic exercise where I revel in the pain and anguish of watching teams flounder when they absolutely shouldn\u2019t. Have I told you I also support the Dutch football team and Tottenham?\u201d You\u2019re not alone in this regard, I imagine. Every league has its variant. 13th over: Bangladesh 96-1 (Tamim 38, Shakib 20) They\u2019re throwing plenty of wides at Bangladesh, these bowlers. Nine so far, as Oshane Thomas comes back to donate one more. He gets cut by Shakib, gorgeously, for four behind point. Wrists snapping down so the ball hit the ground and was no chance to be caught. Thomas comes back with a brilliant bouncer, really fast and at the helmet, which Shakib ducks. That sizzled through. One of the OBO favourites Brian Withington is on the email. \u201cMy neutral favourite today has to be Bangladesh, if only to see a side successfully chase a target above 250 in this WC. I noticed that pre-tournament Virat Kohli predicted that the scoring would not be as high as has become the norm in bilateral series. Not just a fairly useful batsman...\u201d Batsman, statesman, soothsayer? 12th over: Bangladesh 89-1 (Tamim 37, Shakib 15) Shannon Gabriel comes on. He can be very brisk when he wants to be, a pretty significant second-change bowler. But he starts with a a wide down leg. He does well, tying down Tamim for a few balls, but when Shakib gets a chance to swing, the batsman gets a high top edge down to a fine fine leg for four, leaping over the rope. Well bowled. Mind you, whenever I see the name Shannon Gabriel I just think of this guy. 11th over: Bangladesh 81-1 (Tamim 36, Shakib 9) I\u2019m pleased to see that Andre Russell has sorted the lettering on his shirt out. He was Russel in his first match, then Russell with an L that had obviously been hastily added from a sports store and didn\u2019t match the font or positioning when he played Australia, then back to Russel in his previous match after a page designer had obviously had a word, and how has a perfect matching letter. Maybe he borrowed an L from Nigel Lllllllllong? It doesn\u2019t help his bowling though, as Tamim decides this is the over to take him on. First a gorgeous drive on the up through cover. Four. Then a brace bunted over midwicket, unconvincing but effective. Finally a better pull shot, cruched squarer for four more. That with Shakib single to start the over makes 11. Zoom. 10th over: Bangladesh 70-1 (Tamim 26, Shakib 8) Four for Tamim! Perhaps he saw Shakib\u2019s swish and thought he needs to score himself to calm his teammate down? Either way, he throws the bat for the first time, driving square through point. The plan, if it was one, doesn\u2019t work, because when Shakib gets strike he flat-bats Holder from around the wicket for four, through long-off. Still two lefties in the middle. Short again and pulled again, but deep square keeps it to one. Not the last ball of the over though! Tamim pulls that finer, from the line of leg stump, and it bounces away with speed for four! The over costs 14. \u201cI\u2019m a New Zealander, and it\u2019s definitely Windies for me, Geoff. Me and my mate Stanley from Trinidad have tickets for next Saturday at Old Trafford, so ideally we want that match to be a sort of quarter-final. That would probably require NZ to lose to SA in the meantime, but I\u2019m willing to make that sacrifice\u2026\u201d Generous from Alistair Connor. 9th over: Bangladesh 56-1 (Tamim 17, Shakib 3) Right then. Soumya has got his team a reasonably fast start but has to make way. Over to Shakib al Hasan, who hasn\u2019t missed out with the bat yet in this World Cup. Bangladesh need him again today. He gets off the mark nicely, driving down the ground and getting back for three with the field up. Then Russell bounces him, and Shakib nails the pull so hard that Cottrell at mid-on falls over backwards in stopping it. Shakib tries a repeat next ball but meets fresh air. Gone! Soft from Soumya. The first ball of the over he got width from Russell and ramped it for six. The second was tighter, at his body, and he tried to steer to third man but Gayle spends about 40 overs of any innings at slip so he doesn\u2019t have to run. And that ball went straight to him, like a fielding drill. 8th over: Bangladesh 46-0 (Tamim 16, Soumya 23) Tamim is starting to get into his groove, taking a couple of singles from Holder. 7th over: Bangladesh 40-0 (Tamim 11, Soumya 22) Andre Russell will come on to try to take some initiative back. Remarkably he can walk. He\u2019s strapping himself up like Sigourney Weaver at the end of Aliens, adjusting a huge compression bandage that goes from shin to thigh under his maroon strides. But he\u2019s going to bowl a bit before grimacing endlessly and falling over several times and limping from the field and bowling another spell, if history is any guide. And he\u2019s quick, as he always is. Up around 90 miles an hour immediately. Just a couple of singles, as he packs his off side field and bowls outside off. \u201cBangladesh are my second team for this game, and for the entire tournament for that matter,\u201d emails Matthew Potter. \u201cGreat fans, a really likable (and in my opinion, underrated) team, with some seriously fun players to watch. For what it\u2019s worth, I think they\u2019ll just miss out and finish fifth, but I\u2019d at least like it to be dragged out. Let\u2019s hope for a Tamim or Shakib ton! (Partially for fantasy cricket purposes, I had a shocker yesterday opting for Imam over Sharma.)\u201d Ouch. On the other side of the argument, Adam Reed has compelling evidence: 6th over: Bangladesh 38-0 (Tamim 10, Soumya 21) Holder won\u2019t be targeted in the same way, as his awkward bounce from his epic height makes the batsmen take more care, just the odd single. He comes around the wicket to Tamim for the last couple of balls, and Tamim steps across to try a ramp which he misses. He wants a wide, but it passed over his leg stump I\u2019d think. Here\u2019s your preview for England\u2019s match tomorrow from Vic Marks. 5th over: Bangladesh 34-0 (Tamim 9, Soumya 19) Well, Tamim can afford to take his time if Soumya keeps doing this. SIX! First ball of Cottrell\u2019s over, slot ball, and Soumya imagines he\u2019s in the last ten overs rather than the first, and cleans it up over midwicket for half a dozen. That throws off Cottrell enough to drag the next down leg, and Soumya glances it for four. Then a single to third man. Simples. And well, Soumya is living in Cottrell\u2019s head at the moment. Tamim hands the strike back, so Cottrell tries a bouncer. The classic response. He gives it everything, too much in fact, and it launches over Shai Hope\u2019s head for five wides! A single follows, then a top save from Pooran at cover keeps the cost of the over to 18. 4th over: Bangladesh 16-0 (Tamim 8, Soumya 6) Holder continues, and Tamim is playing very cautiously here. Can be a dasher but he wants to get set. After Soumya takes a single first ball, Tamim blots out five. \u201cDumb American watching his first cricket world cup here,\u201d writes Jason Straight to get in ahead of all of you toffy Brits and we tactless Australians. \u201cAll these matches are neutral to me. I\u2019ll go for the Windies on this one to try to keep my hemisphere relevant. Loyalty is up for grabs, so sell me on your national side!\u201d Judging by their Twitter presence, I reckon Iceland Cricket is going cheap. 3rd over: Bangladesh 15-0 (Tamim 8, Soumya 6) Cottrell is bowling well here. A bit of swing, and he draws a mistimed single from Tamim, then a play and miss from Soumya. But when he drops short, Tamim pulls for a couple. \u201cGreetings from a warm and sunny Croatia. Am greatly enjoying the OBO \u2014 many thanks!\u201d No - thank you, Mark Jeffery. \u201cI don\u2019t wish to prejudice the outcome of this game, but there does seem to be an almost inevitable pattern here. Team A wins the toss, puts Team B in to bat, who then run up 320+. Team A run themselves into the ground trying to keep up, fall short, and end up losing by anything from 20-80 runs. Maybe teams should try batting first after all? All best and \u017eivjeli (cheers).\u201d \u017divjeli is one of my favourite philosophers. 2nd over: Bangladesh 11-0 (Tamim 5, Soumya 5) Second over, and it\u2019s time for Captain Jason Holder. I was fortunate enough to do some commentary stints on the wireless with Curtly Ambrose in the West Indies-Australia game at Trent Bridge, and the best thing about him is that he uses \u201cCaptain Jason Holder\u201d every time he mentions the player, as though it were a military title. Thus, I can\u2019t think of Holder as Holder anymore. CJH to his friends. Captain Jason Holder bowls wide to Soumya, who slices riskily away with third man pounding around the boundary rope. But it lands wide of him for a single. Two left-handers batting. CJH then swings the ball into Tamim, hitting him almost on the back hip, going well over the stumps. Tamim manages a run dabbing to point, then Soumya launches into a lofted drive over cover. It\u2019s a clunky one, not timed at all, but there\u2019s no one out there so it eventually dribbles for four. 1st over: Bangladesh 5-0 (Tamim 4, Soumya 0) And we\u2019re away. Sheldon Cottrell, star of the mystifyingly popular television program The Big Bang Theory, will open the bowling for West Indies. Gets wided for a bouncer, so he doesn\u2019t continue with that option. Hangs most of his over across the left-handed Tamim, who waits patiently until the fifth ball, a touch fuller, which gets the treatment through cover. All hands and eye, no feet. With all the rain around, and net run rate being a big talking point at this World Cup, here\u2019s an interesting series of musings from an internet gentleman. Neutral cricket watchers, who is your second team for this match? And why? As always, you can email me via geoff.lemon@theguardian.com, or find me on the old Twitter machine. Here\u2019s one of our stable nailing his red and green colours to the mast early. Thanks Ashers. Well, that was fun. Some brilliant fielding from Bangladesh, not always the cleanest stops but effective ones as they hurled themselves around the field. Both of these teams offer a lot in the way of entertainment, and they\u2019re both playing to keep themselves in this World Cup. I like Bangladesh as a batting side when they click: Tamim, Soumya, Shakib, Mushfiq, Mahmudullah: plenty of quality. So they can do this, but teams defending 300 always start with a big advantage. Right, that\u2019s it from me. Geoff Lemon will be with you very shortly for Bangladesh\u2019s chase. At one point it seemed West Indies might only scramble to 270-odd. Then, briefly, 350 seemed likely. So perhaps somewhere between the two is a fair result. 50th over: West Indies 321-7 (Thomas 5, Bravo 19) Shaifuddin takes the final over and he also starts with a wide but, unlike Mustafizur, he follows it up with another a couple of balls later \u2026 and another. It\u2019s all entirely unnecessary \u2013 Thomas is the man on strike. A single puts Bravo on strike and he heaves over midwicket for six. Ten off the over and still three balls to go. Couple of dots, then a yorker does for Bravo. A strange, strange final couple of overs to complete a very strange innings. 49th over: West Indies 311-7 (Thomas 5, Bravo 13) Mustafizur comes in to send down the penultimate over and starts off with a wide but he improves from that point. Then we have a baffling moment \u2013 Thomas plays and misses, then absent mindedly swings his bat back up and over the stumps, then down on to the bails. It\u2019s incredibly clumsy but not out as he\u2019d finished playing his shot. Odd moment. 48th over: West Indies 305-7 (Thomas 1, Bravo 12) This has been a really fascinating contest, one that has ebbed and flowed more than just about any ODI innings I can remember (though, to be honest, my memory isn\u2019t all that great). Bravo finally finds his mojo and a boundary \u2013 six off the last over long on. 47th over: West Indies 297-7 (Thomas 0, Bravo 6) Since Holder\u2019s wicket \u2013 20 balls, 15 runs. Mustafizurhas bowled beautifully here, mixing up his pace and keeping the batsmen to three singles from the first five balls. From the last Hope, increasingly becalmed, shuffles to the off and looks to flick over square leg but can only pick out the man in the deep. 46th over: West Indies 294-6 (Hope 95, Bravo 4) Shaifuddin again and again this pair struggle to find the rope. Five singles and a couple from the last is all the batsmen get. \u201cMy first cat was ginger too, named after (Kit) Marlowe,\u201d writes John Starbuck. \u201cHis principle role was to lie on my legs whilst I was stretched out watching Test matches on TV. That was back in the \u201870s though. His pals and successors have been variously fascinated by cricket, some of them endeavouring to chase and catch the ball as it rolled towards the boundary. Not so much as for snooker though.\u201d 45th over: West Indies 288-6 (Hope 91, Bravo 2) Holder and Hetmyer combined for 83 from 41. Handy. Mehidy returns with his off spin and keeps things nice and quiet \u2013 single, dot, single, single, single, single. Five from the over. 44th over: West Indies 283-6 (Hope 88, Bravo 0) Darren Bravo finally makes it to the crease. Holder, who is batting wonderfully, clonks Shaifuddin down the ground for four more. He goes to 33 from 14. And, of course, he then skies one into the deep for Mamudullah to pouch. 43rd over: West Indies 274-5 (Hope 86, Holder 27) Mashrafe brings himself back into the attack and Holder smites him into the stands at long on. He goes for it again from the next but toe-ends it a little \u2013 Tamim, diving in, watches the ball bounce under his hands and disappear for four. \u201cMany thanks for the magnificent pic of Brian, the Somerset cat,\u201d writes Robert Wilson. \u201cFirst off, way to go unapologetic ginge. Plus great name. I had a cat called Colin and a grumpy life-ruiner named Norman but I think Brian shades it just for how melancholy it would sound shouted reproachfully across the chilly wastes of an empty sports stadium as a winter evening draws in. The best bit is the expression though. If you give a single minute to inspecting the physiognomy of that redoubtable animal, it quickly becomes clear that this is a cat that really hates cricket. It\u2019s magnificent.\u201d 42nd over: West Indies 261-5 (Hope 84, Holder 16) Who knows where we go from here. The tide just keeps turning. Hope drives sweetly for one, Holder lofts for two. The West Indies captain pulls hard for four from the last but this has been an excellent return from Mustafizur, whose figures for the 40th and 42nd over read 2-0-10-2. 41st over: West Indies 254-5 (Hope 83, Holder 10) Holder\u2019s turn to have them ducking in the stands \u2013 a huge slog-sweep off the returning Shakib that disappears into the crowd. He follows that up with a glorious orthodox cover drive for four. Eleven from the over. 40th over: West Indies 243-5 (Hope 82, Holder 0) Well that changes the tone to some extent! Three runs and two wickets from that over. Jason Holder comes out to join Hope, with Bravo \u2013 in the side as an extra batsman \u2013 sliding down the order. Fair to say Bangladesh needed that. And they\u2019ve got another! A gorgeous delivery from the Fiz, moving across Russell and finding the edge. Hetmyer goes to his 50 off just 25 balls, but that\u2019s yer lot. A skew steeples into the Somerset sky and Tamim takes a tricky tumbling catch in the deep. 39th over: West Indies 240-3 (Hope 81, Hetmyer 49) Mehidy keeps this pair to a series of six singles, which Bangladesh will certainly take at this stage. 38th over: West Indies 234-3 (Hope 78, Hetmyer 46) Hetmyer crashes Mosaddek for another boundary through backward point, pulls for a couple, then heaves over cow corner for six! He moves on to 44 from 18, already a game-changing knock. Fourteen from the first three but Mosaddek responds well \u2013 a couple of dots then a scampered two. 37th over: West Indies 220-3 (Hope 78, Hetmyer 32) The return of the pace bowlers really hasn\u2019t worked, so Bangladesh opt to take a bit of heat off the ball and Mehidy comes back into the attack. The now helmet-free Hetmyer responds with another cracker \u2013 a beautiful back-foot off drive placed precisely for four. 36th over: West Indies 210-3 (Hope 74, Hetmyer 26) Shaifuddin steams in once more with Bangladesh under a bit of pressure for pretty much the first time in the match. PLONK! Hetmyer hooks hard for a big six at backward point. And from the last there\u2019s an even bigger hit \u2013 a gigantic slog sweep that has them running for cover on Taunton high street. Fifteen off the over and Hetmyer moves on to 26 from 12. 35th over: West Indies 193-3 (Hope 69, Hetmyer 14) The left-arm-round Mustafizur returns to the attack. And Hope welcomes him by launching him flat-batted over long off for six! What a shot that was. And he follows it up with a hook for four more. Mustafizur \u2013 a touch irked \u2013 then sends down a bouncer that flies over batsman and keeper and zips away for five wides. Yeesh \u2013 he follows that with another wide: 16 off the over, three balls still to go. A dot follows then there\u2019s more chaos \u2013 the batsmen looking at each other in the middle of the pitch as short third man takes aim at the vacant stumps \u2026 and misses. Two off the last and an over Mustafizur will not want to hear from ever again. 34th over: West Indies 174-3 (Hope 58, Hetmyer 12) Hetmyer means business here \u2013 he thunks Shaifuddin to cow corner for four. Eight off the over. 33rd over: West Indies 166-3 (Hope 55, Hetmyer 7) Things are in danger of unravelling here for West Indies \u2013 both times they\u2019ve looked to really accelerate they\u2019ve lost a wicket. Hetmyer looks to pepper the spectators straight away, slog-sweeping away for a couple, then smartly sweeping in more orthordox fashion for four. More, more, more from Shakib. Out, out, out goes Pooran! He slogs hard but can\u2019t get a clean hit on Shakib and can only launch the ball to long on. 32nd over: West Indies 158-2 (Hope 54, Pooran 25) Shaifuddin (3-1-12-1) returns and has Pooran playing and missing wildly outside off. A couple of singles later, he repeats the trick off the last. An excellent return \u2013 just two off the over and that run rates drops below five again. 31st over: West Indies 156-2 (Hope 53, Pooran 24) The West Indies run rate creeps above five-an-over for the first time \u2013 they\u2019ll be eyeing 300, though it\u2019s far from a certainty. Shakib again restricts the batsmen to singles, five of them this time. 30th over: West Indies 151-2 (Hope 51, Pooran 21) Pooran is ready to go. He launches Mehidy down the ground for a couple but finds the sweet spot next ball, back over the bowler\u2019s head for a huge six. New ball required. But a good response from the bowler \u2013 three dots and a single follow that huge hit. \u201cIf E and L wander off, there could be HANDBAGS,\u201d frets Nick Way. 29th over: West Indies 141-2 (Hope 51, Pooran 12) Shakib rattles through an over so quickly I barely noticed it happened. Just two from it. 28th over: West Indies 139-2 (Hope 50, Pooran 10) Mehidy returns. Hope skips down the wicket and clunks a drive down the ground for two, then a skittered single takes Hope to his half century. Pooran joins the fun, thrashing low through point for four more. Nine from the over. 27th over: West Indies 130-2 (Hope 47, Pooran 5) Shakib continues and keeps the batsmen to just a single. 26th over: West Indies 129-2 (Hope 46, Pooran 5) There\u2019s certainly more intent about West Indies now. Mosaddek offers a bit of width for just about the first time and Pooran gets off the mark with a firm cut for four. 25th over: West Indies 122-2 (Hope 44, Pooran 0) Pooran plays and misses at his first delivery and Shakib follows up his wicket with three dots. WHUMP! Lewis gets on one knee and slog-sweeps Shakib into the square-leg stands. The world\u2019s No 1 all-rounder is struggling so far. And, pretty much as I\u2019m typing that, he gets his man. Lewis is aiming for the stands again but this time skews to long on. 24th over: West Indies 114-1 (Hope 44, Lewis 62) Mosaddek rattles through another \u2013 six fuss-free singles off it. 23rd over: West Indies 108-1 (Hope 41, Lewis 59) Lewis brings up his half-century (from 58 balls) with a neat push down the ground for a single. He\u2019s batted nicely since a slightly scrappy start. Hope then cuts for three, a brilliant bit of fielding on the rope forcing the batsmen to panic-scamper the third. Another single brings up the 100 for the Windies and back to back boundaries for Lewis \u2013 the first swept fine, the second slammed uppishly through backward point \u2013 mean 14 from the over and a bit of much-needed acceleration. 22nd over: West Indies 94-1 (Hope 37, Lewis 49) There\u2019s a bit of a retro feel about this at the moment \u2013 only two boundaries since the 13th over. And four singles off this latest effort from Mosaddek. 21st over: West Indies 90-1 (Hope 35, Lewis 47) Shakib Al Hasan into the attack for the first time today, left-arm round. Nudge and nurdle is the order of the day \u2013 four singles in total. \u201cIf only the \u2018L\u2019 and \u2018S letter-shirt people wandered off, the others could end up spelling HEADBANG,\u201d notes Mac Millings. \u201cBut if everyone stays and switches seats, we might get DANGLEBASH, or BLADEGNASH, both of which sound pretty painful. 20th over: West Indies 86-1 (Hope 33, Lewis 45) Mosaddek again. Hope drives sumptuously for two (Mahmudullah making a fine stop; Hope thought it had gone \u2013 he stood and admired it for a few seconds before begrudgingly setting off for the run). 19th over: West Indies 82-1 (Hope 30, Lewis 44) Mustafizur continues and Lewis misses out as he strays to leg, Shaifuddin\u2019s fine fielding at fine leg preventing the boundary. But there\u2019s nothing he can do with this \u2013 an attempted bouncer his helped on its way by Lewis who this time does find the rope. 18th over: West Indies 75-1 (Hope 28, Lewis 39) More spin \u2013 Mosaddek, obviously recovered from his knock, into the attack. A fine bit of fielding from Shakib at square leg denies Hope a certain boundary and after just five dots there is just a single off the last. 17th over: West Indies 74-1 (Hope 27, Lewis 39) West Indies have rebuilt pretty well after that ropey start. You wouldn\u2019t quite say they\u2019re on top yet but they\u2019re definitely in the game. Tidy stuff from Mustafizur here, keeping the batsmen to a single apiece. 16th over: West Indies 72-1 (Hope 26, Lewis 38) Lewis shovels Mehidy through the off-side for a couple. Mossadek fields on the boundary and seems to have done himself a mischief, so they take drinks while he gets some treatment. He goes off and after the break Hope rocks back and punches through the covers for four. 15th over: West Indies 64-1 (Hope 21, Lewis 35) Mustafizur replaces Mortaza, who can go and soak his aching bones for a while. Is Shai Hope\u2019s off-drive the most aesthetically pleasing shot in world cricket at the moment? It\u2019s definitely up there. And he unfurls a corker here (for one). 14th over: West Indies 58-1 (Hope 17, Lewis 35) The Bangladeshi fans seem to be out in force in Taunton \u2013 we get a nice shot of 10 fans, each with one letter of the country\u2019s name on their shirts. You\u2019ve got to be organised with that sort of thing, particularly as the day wears on. There\u2019s no way I\u2019d risk it: all it takes is for a couple of people to wander off at some point and a few people to switch seats and before you know it you\u2019re sat in a row with LASAGNE or GLANDES on your T-shirts. Mehidy twirls through another over, giving up only ones and twos. 13th over: West Indies 53-1 (Hope 15, Lewis 32) \u201cRe: Animal mascots,\u201d begins Charles Montague. \u201cThe Oz badge features two animals that are very much alive and kicking (and punching) in the Australian wild.\u201d Mashrafe continues into his seventh over. Perhaps once those poor old knees get mobile it\u2019s best to keep them moving. He drops a touch short and Lewis is on to it like a shot, pulling hard for a one-bounce four to cow corner. 12th over: West Indies 45-1 (Hope 14, Lewis 26) Mehidy continues and Lewis benefits from a misfield to pinch a single. But it\u2019s more tight stuff from the spinner. 11th over: West Indies 42-1 (Hope 12, Lewis 24) That is apparently the lowest score after 10 overs in the tournament so far, testament to an excellent Bangladesh bowling performance. Lewis has had enough of it \u2013 he slams Mortaza over wide long on for six to get the juices flowing. 10th over: West Indies 32-1 (Hope 12, Lewis 17) Mehidy, the off-spinner, into the attack. Tidy stuff from the youngster \u2013 just the two singles off the over. West Indies haven\u2019t got going at all yet. 9th over: West Indies 30-1 (Hope 11, Lewis 16) Mortaza (4-1-8-0) continues and by the end of the over he has figures of 5-1-9-0. 8th over: West Indies 29-1 (Hope 11, Lewis 15) The first bowling change of the day: Mustafizur comes into the attack. He\u2019s a little too straight throughout, though, and the batsmen are able to tickle him away for a few singles before he overcompensates and Hope is able to punch a short wide one through the covers for four. And here\u2019s the full story on that Jason Roy news: 7th over: West Indies 21-1 (Hope 6, Lewis 13) Mortaza maintains his stranglehold \u2013 tight line and length giving up just three singles. A bit of news from elsehwere: the ECB has confirmed England\u2019s Jason Roy has a hamstring tear and will miss at least two matches. 6th over: West Indies 18-1 (Hope 5, Lewis 11) Yes, this has been an excellent start for Bangladesh. It\u2019s always been an excellent start for Bangladesh. No one ever said it was an excellent start for Sri Lanka. Especially not in the fourth over. No sirree. Don\u2019t know where you got that from. Fake news, I reckon. Hope pirouette-pulls beautifully for four to get off the mark. And Lewis joins the fun later in the over \u2013 Shaifuddin dropping short and offering the sort of width the West Indies opener loves \u2013 four more. Then an escape \u2013 Lewis edging with soft hands just short of slip. 5th over: West Indies 8-1 (Hope 0, Lewis 6) Mortaza continues to trundle in and hit a nice length. Lewis blocks to wide of mid off for a quick single. And a leg bye means just two off the over. 4th over: West Indies 6-1 (Hope 0, Lewis 5) So this has become an excellent start for Bangladesh. Gayle looked a little dozy, a little sluggish, a little like he\u2019d rather be sat on the settee at home \u2013 basically a little like most people on a Monday morning. A wicket maiden for Shaifuddin and only two scoring shots from the Windies so far. Back to Gayle then, who has now gone 12 balls without getting off the mark. And he\u2019s not going to get off the mark! His 13th delivery tempts him into a tentative, awkward push outside off and the ball just carries through to the keeper. 3rd over: West Indies 6-0 (Gayle 0, Lewis 5) A big play-and-miss from Lewis as Mortaza finds some movement off the pitch but he connects with the next \u2013 short and wide from the bowler and thunked through point for four. An inside edge then rattles into the pads and trickles wide of the off stump. 2nd over: West Indies 2-0 (Gayle 0, Lewis 1) Shaifuddin with the new ball at the River End. Lewis pushes his first ball into the off to get us under way and next up Shaifuddin sends down a leg-side wide but Gayle is taking his time to settle in. He\u2019s now seen out seven eight nine 10 11 dots. 1st over: West Indies 0-0 (Gayle 0, Lewis 0) Mashrafe Mortaza opens the bowling, with Chris Gayle coiled at the striker\u2019s end. The Bangladesh captain squares Gayle up with his second ball and, despite offering the batsman a bit of width later in the over, he starts off with a maiden. \u201cIs Bangladesh the only cricketing nation sporting an animal mascot which still roams (bits of) its landscape?\u201d wonders Marting Wright. \u201cLions in Whipsnade don\u2019t count.\u201d Anthemwatch: two of the jauntier anthems on the international circuit these. Amar Sonar Bangla lasts about an hour and a half but doesn\u2019t really outstay it\u2019s welcome as it\u2019s such a nice tune. And I\u2019m not a massive fan of \u201cRally Round the West Indies\u201d but it\u2019s still better than most. Out come the teams. Amusingly, the young mascot seems to be dragging Chris Gayle out there. A bit of pre-match reading: here\u2019s Moeen Ali\u2019s latest column for us: West Indies: Gayle, Lewis, Hope, Pooran, Bravo, Hetmyer, Holder, Russell, Cottrell, Thomas, Gabriel. Bangladesh: Tamim, Soumya, Shakib, Mushfiqur, Litton, Mahmudullah, Mosaddek, Shaifuddin, Mehidy, Mashrafe, Mustafizur. Bangladesh\u2019s Mashrafe Mortaza wins the toss and is going to have a bowl. Bangladesh can feel a little hard-done-by so far in this tournament. They thumped South Africa and got very close against New Zealand before falling short against England \u2013 and if you wanted one of your games rained off, you wouldn\u2019t choose the one against Sri Lanka. I make them favourites today. Morning all. We\u2019re pretty much slap-bang at the halfway point of the group stage and this feels like a must-win for both sides if either are to maintain realistic hopes of making the semi-finals. The good news from Taunton is that for the first time since wooly mammoths were roaming the Somerset wilds, there\u2019s no rain forecast. We should \u2013 should \u2013 be delay-free for the duration."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
