Leicester\u2019s unwanted away record continues and it is now eight months since Claudio Ranieri\u2019s side tasted victory on the road in the league. Eddie Howe, in contrast, left the field after kissing Nathan Ak\u00e9, high-fiving Steve Cook and with his team eighth in the table, their highest ever position. Leicester\u2019s return of one point from their first eight away matches is the lowest total by a defending top-flight title-winning team. After walking out on to the pitch to stretch their legs, Jamie Vardy and Marc Albrighton were soaked by the Bournemouth sprinklers. From that moment on it was a miserable outing for Leicester, who failed to show the mettle of champions in Ranieri\u2019s 200th Premier League match. \u201cWe have to react, we have to be more concentrated, more determined, [to] show more willingness. We need something more \u2013 more everything,\u201d Ranieri said. \u201cIn the Champions League we play so well and in the Premier League we do not. I do not know why.\u201d Ranieri looked as baffled as anybody by his side\u2019s mysterious away form, with their last win away from the King Power Stadium coming at Sunderland in April. Vardy was guilty of spurning a golden chance after racing on to Riyad Mahrez\u2019s crisp through ball in a first 45 minutes dominated by the hosts. Bournemouth could have been in front inside three minutes had Adam Smith\u2019s head made contact with Charlie Daniels\u2019 low cross. Jack Wilshere, playing in a deeper role, also tested Ron-Robert Zieler with an effort from distance. Howe praised Wilshere\u2019s \u201cbest game\u201d in a Bournemouth shirt. Zieler booted his goalkick into the backside of Benik Afobe and the ball ran out of play for a throw-in. Afobe reacted quickly, teeing up Pugh, the Bournemouth winger making his first Premier League start of the season, and he attempted an ambitious lob on the German goalkeeper. Robert Huth saw a shot deflected wide from a corner but Leicester were unable to truly test Artur Boruc in the Bournemouth goal. Huth was later fortunate not to pick up a booking after tugging back Harry Arter as Bournemouth counter-attacked. Bournemouth were in no mood to back down and the home side were eventually rewarded for their effort. After being picked out by Simon Francis, the marauding Smith slid the ball across from the right for Afobe who fired low towards goal, only for Zieler to save with his legs. But the rebound fell straight to Pugh, Bournemouth\u2019s longest-serving player, and he half-volleyed the ball past the Leicester goalkeeper, whose right hand was not strong enough to prevent the shot hitting the net. Behind at the interval, Ranieri\u2019s team arrived early for the second half, with the club-record signing, Islam Slimani, replaced by Shinji Okazaki. \u201cI said \u2018show me the desire to win the match\u2019 and sometimes we have to be more aggressive and press higher,\u201d Ranieri said. There was plenty of endeavour but Leicester, who were drawn against Sevilla in Monday\u2019s Champions League last\u201116 draw, came up short on quality. Howe had urged his side to show no signs of a \u201changover\u201d after the defeat at Burnley on Saturday and Bournemouth were dogged yet inventive throughout here. \u201cWe have been in the Premier League a while but [to say we are eighth] is a nice thing,\u201d the Bournemouth manager said. \u201cI think the most pleasing thing is this season we have the ability to respond to setbacks very well, and that\u2019s a really good sign for the future. \u201cI still think there\u2019s a lot more to come and I think we are in a really good position to get better. The club\u2019s come so far so quickly I am always trying to look for the next goal and that\u2019s now to try and beat Southampton [on Sunday].\u201d Leicester\u2019s prime weaponry was blunted. A more direct approach almost paid dividends, with Luis Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s long throw momentarily unsettling the Bournemouth back line. Bournemouth were forced to soak up Leicester pressure and the referee, Paul Tierney, waved away appeals for a penalty when Ak\u00e9 clumsily upended Vardy inside the box. Leicester could have snatched a point with only injury-time remaining but Bournemouth, Boruc and his defence stood tall. Vardy crossed from the right for Leonardo Ulloa, a late substitute, but the Bournemouth goalkeeper somehow kept out his close-range shot before Okazaki was denied by the diving legs of Cook and Ak\u00e9."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
