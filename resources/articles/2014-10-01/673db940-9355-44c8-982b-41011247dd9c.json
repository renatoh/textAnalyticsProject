The Wasps flanker is back on his feet but, if he features against New Zealand next week, it will be a huge testament to the nurses and doctors at Charing Cross hospital who were treating him for suspected meningitis this time last week. Only a few days before joining the England squad in Bagshot for this week\u2019s training camp, Haskell was lying in a darkened room, unable to open his eyes, eat or drink. He lost 5kg and was required to undergo a lumbar puncture and numerous blood tests amid rising fears that he had contracted a potentially life-threatening virus. The 29-year-old, fortunately, is still around to tell the vivid tale but says he will not forget the experience in a hurry. \u201cI\u2019ve never been that ill in my life. It was weird \u2026 it just came upon me. The Wasps doctor visited me at home and said: \u2018There\u2019s something wrong with you.\u2019 I said: \u2018We all know that but there\u2019s something more wrong than normal.\u2019\u201d After a further assessment at Princess Margaret hospital, Haskell was taken by ambulance to Charing Cross when staff became concerned at his slow rate of recovery. \u201cTheir big concern was that I had meningitis. That\u2019s why they put me in an ambulance. They were saying: \u2018You can\u2019t mess around with that.\u2019 They knew it wasn\u2019t bacterial meningitis but they thought it might be the viral version because I had all the symptoms of it. \u201cSo they took me to hospital and got me straight on to the antivirals and antibiotics. I got a little bit better but next day I hit rock bottom again. They weren\u2019t sure what was going on so they did a lumbar puncture, took fluid out of my spine and conducted numerous blood tests. \u201cI lost about five kilos in a week. I wasn\u2019t vomiting or suffering from diarrhoea, it was just fever and not eating. I couldn\u2019t open my eyes because they were too sensitive to light. My lower back and my neck were also very stiff so I couldn\u2019t really move out of bed at all. I spent hours lying in bed with a cold flannel on my head, in a dark room, on a drip, not eating or drinking. It was a case of man down, really.\u201d Haskell was released from hospital on Friday and remains hopeful he can still win a place in England\u2019s matchday squad for the All Blacks fixture. \u201cI would be extremely disappointed if my illness had a factor in whether I am involved or not. I have only missed one session outside. I don\u2019t want to overextend myself because you can push yourself over the edge and be ill for ages but every day I am doing a little bit more. I am sure when I am back in what I would call full training mode I will pick the weight up pretty quickly. I am still 114kg. It is not like I am small. \u201cThe only thing I can say is that, if I get into a full training session and I suddenly can\u2019t cope with it, then I will be the first to put my hand up. If you are trying to muddle through, especially at international level, you are going to get caught out pretty quick. I know I don\u2019t play particularly well unless I am 100%. I need that energy to play the type of game I want to play but I don\u2019t foresee it as being an issue.\u201d Stuart Lancaster said he wants to involve as many players as possible in a full-contact session this Thursday before the England head coach finalises his starting XV to face New Zealand on Saturday week. Unless Haskell is able to participate fully, the management may well opt not to consider him for selection until the game against South Africa the following week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
