Marc L\u00e9pine\u2019s page-long suicide note, written in French, made his motivations clear: \u201cFeminists have always enraged me,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI have decided to send the feminists, who have always ruined my life, to their Maker.\u201d In Canada, 6 December is now a national day of remembrance and action on violence against women. But the events of three decades ago are not a horrifying memory safely confined to a bygone era. From the viewpoint of 2019, the Polytechnique shooting now seems like an unfortunate foretelling of things to come. Two weeks ago, a young woman in Chicago was killed by a man after she ignored his catcalls. Last November, a man whose hatred of women was well-documented online shot six women at a hot yoga studio, killing two. And seven months earlier, a man named Alek Minassian drove a van on to a Toronto sidewalk and killed 10 people, eight of them women. The sexually frustrated young man behind the van\u2019s wheel \u2013 a self-described incel, or \u201cinvoluntary celibate\u201d \u2013 saw his act as retribution against women who had starved him of the affection he felt he was rightfully owed. Minassian said he was inspired by Elliot Rodger, an incel and wannabe pickup artist who shot 20 people in 2014. \u201cI think the link between Polytechnique and the van attack is so clear, so direct, so obvious,\u201d said Julie Lalonde, a Canadian educator focused on violence against women. The link is more than a virulent hatred of women \u2013 it is also the ability for misogynists and antifeminists to find support for that hatred in both fringe groups and in mainstream culture. Finding that support is easier now than it\u2019s ever been. The pseudonymous \u201cLiz\u201d (a volunteer researcher on hate groups in Canada who \u201couts\u201d extremists \u2013 and who uses a fake name because of the volume of violent threats her alter ego receives) says misogyny is a powerful undercurrent in all alt-right and white supremacist online groups. \u201cWhere do you really start to discuss the intersection between misogyny and hate groups, when they are really one and the same?\u201d asked Liz, adding that hatred of women often serves as a base upon which to build other forms of hate. \u201cThe fact that [misogyny] acts as such a pipeline makes the incel movement exceptionally dangerous,\u201d Liz continued. \u201cI think that\u2019s actually an aspect that people overlook; people look at it as kind of insular, like it\u2019s in a vacuum \u2013 \u2018Oh, they just hate women.\u2019 But hate is infectious. When you learn to hate, you learn to hate more, and more, and more. It\u2019s a drug.\u201d When L\u00e9pine began composing his ideology back in the 1980s, he didn\u2019t have an internet commiseration machine; in his suicide note, he said it took him seven years to form his extremist views. Those views ultimately ended in a mass shooting and a meticulously assembled hitlist of 19 accomplished women he would have killed if not for a \u201clack of time\u201d. L\u00e9pine targeted Polytechnique specifically because the women there were pursuing careers in engineering \u2013 a discipline he believed should be reserved for men. Nathalie Provost was 23 when L\u00e9pine shot her. Four bullets from his legally obtained rifle entered her body and changed her life forever. L\u00e9pine had entered her classroom and sent the 50 men and nine women to opposite sides of the room. Then he ordered the men to leave. \u201cHe told us that we were there because he was against feminists,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cI answered back, \u2018We are not feminists. We are just engineering students, and if you want to study at Polytechnique you just have to apply and you\u2019ll be welcomed.\u2019 And then he shot.\u201d Six of the nine women in that room were killed. Provost believes the same forces that radicalised the Polytechnique shooter were at work with Minassian and Alexandre Bissonnette, the young man who killed six people inside a Quebec City mosque in 2017. Both young men were radicalised online in communities that legitimized their hatred; in Bissonnette\u2019s case, his online search history revealed he had researched feminism before deciding to kill Muslims. A woman or girl is killed every 2.5 days in Canada, yet the issue went unaddressed during the country\u2019s 2019 federal election. Lalonde and M\u00e9lissa Blais, a Montreal university professor and expert on the Polytechnique shooting, both say that a major obstacle to solving the issue is a widespread unwillingness to call violence against women what it is: an act of hatred. \u201cMarc L\u00e9pine was not the last of the dinosaurs; it\u2019s the opposite. It\u2019s worrying. We absolutely need to renew our view of current forms of antifeminism, and to be able to speak about it without being afraid,\u201d said Blais. That\u2019s why she campaigned to have the city change a commemorative plaque hanging outside of a Montreal park honouring the women killed at Polytechnique. Instead of ambiguously reminding visitors to contemplate the \u201cvictims of the Polytechnique tragedy\u201d, the brand-new sign speaks in no uncertain terms: \u201cThis park is named in the memory of 14 women assassinated in an antifeminist attack.\u201d For Blais and Liz, it\u2019s critical to recognize that misogyny and antifeminism are often not ends in themselves, but rather strings that people can follow to the most extreme, violent forms of hatred. And there\u2019s no doubt that if L\u00e9pine existed at the same time as online hate groups and YouTube extremism, he would have used the internet to feed and shape his ideology and plan the shooting, said Liz. \u201cThe only difference now is that he would have live-streamed it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
