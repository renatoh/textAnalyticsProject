Ronaldo's fondness for looking for free-kicks earlier in his career almost certainly contributed to the referee Rob Styles denying him a penalty in Manchester United's 2-0 defeat of Fulham on Monday and Giggs, like Ferguson, feels his team-mate is being treated unfairly by match officials. Ferguson has described it as \"unbelievable\" that Styles brandished a yellow card in Ronaldo's direction after he seemed to have been brought down by Fulham's goalkeeper, Antti Niemi, and Giggs spoke of the feeling at Old Trafford that the club's leading scorer is paying because of his past mistakes. Ronaldo, famously branded a \"cheat\" by the Middlesbrough manager, Gareth Southgate, may have nobody but himself to blame for that, but the official line from United is that he has eradicated diving from his game and should be treated the same as everyone else. \"I think Ronnie had that reputation [as a diver] when he first came here, but that's gone now,\" said Giggs. \"It was hard for the referee because it happened so quickly, but because Ronnie was running so fast the referee has had to make a split-second decision. I think because there was no obvious contact, he didn't give a penalty - but all Ronnie did was try to avoid the keeper, so in my view that cannot be seen as simulation.\" Ferguson's complaint after the game was not solely with Styles but also Niemi, accusing him of \"conning\" the referee by making diving gestures in Ronaldo's direction. The television replays proved the Finn had done little more than indicate to Styles there had been no contact. However, Giggs was the next closest player and he was convinced Ronaldo had legitimate reasons for going down. \"Niemi has tried to stop Ronnie and his arm has followed his leg, so everyone thought it was a penalty,\" he said. \"I think when the referee sees it again he will realise he has made a mistake. But you'd have to ask the referee about that.\" Ronaldo could conceivably have been sent off for dissent after sarcastically applauding Styles' decision to book him, but since the end of the game the player has chosen to handle the situation with dignity. Yesterday he refused to criticise Styles, even though the decision deprived him of the chance to score the first hat-trick of his United career. \"I don't want to speak too much about the penalty incident,\" he said. \"All I will say is that I always try to play in an honest way. It's frustrating because he gave me a yellow card, but football is like that - the referee makes a mistake, the players sometimes make mistakes. I don't think the ref did a good job on this occasion, but I have to respect his decision.\" Did he jump or was he pushed? Sep 03 v Charlton A United win 2-0 as Ronaldo first shows signs of collapsibility when tackled. May 04 v Aston Villa A Expresses disbelief on being booked for diving. Is later sent off in 2-0 win. Dec 06 v Middlesbrough A Tumbles for a penalty in 2-1 win. \"He has a history of it,\" says Gareth Southgate. Feb 07 v Tottenham A Another fall, another penalty as United win 4-0. \"It wasn't a penalty,\" says Martin Jol. Mar 07 v Lille H Booked for diving in penalty area under Mathieu Chalm\u00e9's challenge in 1-0 win. Mar 07 v Middlesbro' H Wins penalty to secure 1-0 win to cries of \"cheat\" from the Middlesbrough bench."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
