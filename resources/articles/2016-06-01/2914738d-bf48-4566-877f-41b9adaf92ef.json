Speaking on the eve of Saturday\u2019s last-16 tie at the Parc des Princes, the Wales manager challenged his team to push themselves to the limit but also cautioned against getting wrapped up in the emotion of the occasion. Wales were brilliant on Monday night in Toulouse where they beat Russia 3-0 to finish top of Group B ahead of England. Coleman has no intention of settling for that performance in a tournament that he sees as the start, rather than the end, of their journey. \u201cI\u2019m never content and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a curse or a good thing,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cWhen a special moment happens I really enjoy it but I\u2019m over it quite quickly. I remember it, yes, but I want to chase the next one. I\u2019m the same as everyone after what happened [against Russia] \u2013 brilliant. But I think we need a little bit more of that and I think we can have a bit more of that. \u201cI don\u2019t think this tournament, wherever we fall, this is not it for this team. They are on their way and they will be here long after I\u2019ve gone. This is a good bunch and they are capable of achieving things. This is the biggest thing they\u2019ve ever been part of but by no means is it: \u2018Wow, we got there, that was fantastic.\u2019 It\u2019s going to be: \u2018What do we do after this? Are we going to rest or are we going to go again?\u2019 \u201cWe want to go further and we\u2019ve a chance. Let\u2019s do everything we can to take that chance. Put yourself out there and in a position where you know you will do your absolute best and you could end up being incredibly disappointed. That\u2019s not always a nice feeling when you\u2019ve given everything and it\u2019s not enough \u2013 it\u2019s an empty feeling. \u201cThat\u2019s why people have failed before, because they\u2019re afraid of doing that. I\u2019m not \u2013 and we are not. Let\u2019s give everything, let\u2019s ask for everything. What we can gain is incredible. We did it against Russia but we now want to do it again.\u201d Northern Ireland, however, promise to be awkward opponents because of the way they defend in numbers. Michael O\u2019Neill\u2019s side tend to sit deep and are difficult to break down, and Coleman also highlighted their aerial threat at set pieces. The two countries know each other well having met in a friendly in Cardiff only three months ago; it finished a 1-1 draw, although on that evening Wales were without Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey, while Joe Allen, another hugely influential player, started on the bench. For Coleman it is important Wales learn from their mistakes in the 2-1 defeat against England, when they did not pass the ball with anything like the confidence they showed against Russia and seemed to be too immersed in the occasion and all the hype that surrounded a \u201cBattle of Britain\u201d fixture. \u201cWe fought really well and we stood our corner out of possession,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cWhen we had the ball, however, we never played anywhere near our capabilities because we got caught up with all the emotion of the game because it was a derby. That\u2019s what we needed to put right in the game against Russia - which we did. So as much as we can we need to take the emotion out of it against Northern Ireland.\u201d Probable Wales team to face Northern Ireland Hennessey; Chester, A Williams, Davies; Gunter, Allen, Ledley, Taylor; Ramsey, Bale; Vokes"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
