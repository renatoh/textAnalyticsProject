Joe Root\u2019s side will resume on 10 for no loss on the second morning at Edgbaston after Smith\u2019s 144 from 219 balls, in his first Test since his 12-month ball-tampering ban, helped Australia reach 284 all out in 80.4 overs. Stuart Broad stood out for England with the ball, claiming five for 86 from 22.4 overs. Australia\u2019s total might have been considered a triumph for England after losing Anderson only four overs into his day\u2019s work, with the 37-year-old pulling up lame and now awaiting scan results on the same right calf muscle that was torn last month. But with the tourists having been reeling at 122 for eight before tea on a seam-friendly pitch \u2013 before Smith helped put on 162 runs for the last two wickets and brought up his 24th Test century \u2013 England\u2019s batsmen face a tougher task than might otherwise have been. The former Australia captain insisted a hostile reception from elements of the crowd did not affect him. But he admitted to strong emotions upon reaching three figures, having briefly fallen out of love with the game during his well-documented ban. Smith said: \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time coming but I\u2019m sort of lost for words. I\u2019m just really proud that I was able to help pull the team out of a bit of trouble. The Aussie supporters that were here were very loud today when I got to a hundred and I just saw the boys going berserk on the balcony, which was just a huge moment. \u201cThere were times throughout the last 15 months where I didn\u2019t know if I was ever going to play cricket again. I lost a bit of love for it at one point, particularly when I had my elbow operation [in January]. \u201cIt was really bizarre that it was the day I got the brace off my elbow, I found a love for it again. I don\u2019t know what it was, it was like a trigger that just said: \u2018Right I\u2019m ready to go again, I want to play and I want to go out and play for Australia and make people proud and just do what I love doing.\u2019 \u201cI\u2019m really grateful to be in this position now, playing for Australia again and doing what I love.\u201d Broad spoke of his pride at reaching 100 Ashes wickets \u2013 \u201cAshes cricket is the pinnacle, especially with my family history\u201d \u2013 and was delighted with the efforts of England\u2019s depleted attack. On his strike partner Anderson, Broad said: \u201cHe\u2019s not had the results back yet but he\u2019s down, he\u2019s frustrated, and he\u2019s said sorry to the bowlers \u2013 not that he has to. He\u2019s down in the dumps as he feels he\u2019s let the bowling group down but he hasn\u2019t \u2013 niggles are part of bowling.\u201d Asked about the match situation, Broad replied: \u201cI forgot how nerve-racking Ashes cricket was. You\u2019d take a total under 300 every day of the week but we don\u2019t know how good a score that will be until we\u2019ve batted. \u201cA positive for us is the way Steve Smith played showed runs can be got out there. Obviously at 122 for eight we wanted much less but he played beautifully.\u201d It was Broad\u2019s first five-wicket haul on home soil since his series-sealing eight for 15 at Trent Bridge during the 2015 Ashes, completed when finally hitting Smith\u2019s stumps to wrap up the Australian innings. And there was a nod to that famous spell with the wicket of Tim Paine. The Australian captain was caught by Rory Burns at deep square leg on the pull as Broad produced another hands-to-mouth look of shock in celebration. Broad explained: \u201cMoeen Ali told me Rooty wanted a bouncer but I didn\u2019t realise that he had moved Burnsy back. Hence the silly face. During our pre-series camp at St George\u2019s Park we were handed dossiers on their batsmen and a few of the plans came off today.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
