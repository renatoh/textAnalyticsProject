The report, released on Wednesday by Legal Aid Victoria, found that residential care providers were calling police to deal with behavioural issues of children under their care, often initiating their first contact with the youth justice system. It analysed data from Legal Aid\u2019s representation of children aged 11 to 17 over the past five years and found that of the children it represented in child protection matters, a third later returned for assistance with criminal charges. It also found that children who were placed in some form of out-of-home care as a result of those child protection matters were twice as likely to face criminal charges as those who lived with their families. According to anecdotal evidence from Legal Aid lawyers, the report said, most of those charged with criminal offences were in residential care, meaning they were placed in a group home under the care of child protection workers. Legal Aid has used the report to call on the Andrews government to adopt an inter-agency protocol to reduce the contact of young people in residential care with police and the justice system, similar to protocols in place in New South Wales and Britain. The Department of Health and Human Services has already established a working group with Legal Aid, police, residential care providers and the Centre for Excellence in Family and Child Welfare to discuss how to address the overrepresentation of children from the out-of-home care system in the justice system. \u201cChildren who have been victims of serious neglect, abuse and trauma are at much greater risk of both coming into state care and of becoming involved in youth crime,\u201d a department spokeswoman said. Nicole Rich, director of family, youth, and children\u2019s law at Legal Aid Victoria, said the report was sparked by lawyers raising concerns about children being charged over incidents that would not result in a call-out to police if they occurred in the family home. \u201cThey are engaging in behaviour that there\u2019s no doubt is challenging behaviour, and if they do it in a family home you would say it\u2019s bad behaviour, but you would not see the police called,\u201d Rich told Guardian Australia. \u201cBut in a residential care situation, which we acknowledge is a workplace, they do have police called.\u201d Rich said that while the juvenile offenders were most commonly charged with theft, children who had been in out-of-home care were most likely to be charged with property damage. Of those seen by Legal Aid, 83% received their first charge within 12 months of being in care, meaning that they had not been in contact with the justice system before. Once a child or young person was charged and brought before the youth justice system, Rich said, it started a cycle that made it easier for them to return. \u201cBeing in contact with the youth justice system is in itself a really significant factor in returning to the youth justice system,\u201d she said. Case studies in the report include: A 15-year-old girl charged with aggravated burglary and criminal damage for breaking into the internal office of the residential unit and damaging a cabinet and some papers. On another occassion, she was charged with criminal damage for breaking a coffee cup belonging to the unit and damaging some of her own personal possessions, although the charges for damaging her own things were withdrawn. A 14-year-old boy charged with criminal damage for once throwing a coffee cup at the wall, and later throwing a plate at the wall. A 13-year-old girl from a violent home charged with assaulting a care worker. She had slapped the worker after they tried to drag her out of bed and said her allowance would be deducted for \u201caggressive behaviour\u201d. An 11-year-old boy with autism, an intellectual disability and ADHD, who was charged with assaulting police and resisting arrest after he refused to let go of his mother after a weekend visit. His mother had told care workers she was happy to remain until he calmed down but they called police who \u201cpulled him off his mother, kicking and screaming.\u201d The same boy was later charged with assaulting a care worker and discharging a missile for throwing a rubber thong, a rubber sink plug and a whisk at a care worker. He received a total of 25 charges during his few months in care. The typical scenario, the report said, was that the young person would have a minor confrontation with care workers over something such as a failure to comply with an instruction. That triggered an outburst by the young person and a \u201cdisplay of challenging behaviour\u201d and the unit staff called police. \u201cIn many instances, the attendance of the police further escalates the situation, with the young person then sometimes accruing additional charges for resisting arrest or assaulting police,\u201d the report said. There are 240 residential care units in Victoria. As of this month 442 young people were in residential care, out of a total of about 8,000 children in all forms of out-of-home care. The Andrews government has moved to reduce the number of children in residential care, moving 140 young people out and into other forms of care in June, but there is still no formal structure to stop the flow of young people in care from going into youth detention. A spokeswoman from the department said the government was investing $168m to move from a crisis response model to an early intervention model for child protection matters. According to a 2016 report by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, children in the child protection system were 14 times more likely to be involved in the criminal justice system than children who were not in the child protection system, and children in the justice system were 15 times more likely to also be known to the child protection system than children who were not in the justice system."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
