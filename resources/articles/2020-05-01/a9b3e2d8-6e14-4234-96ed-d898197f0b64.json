Perhaps they peered out of the window, had a little play in the garden, dug a hole, chewed on a bone or a piece of string. Or, in our minds, did they yearn for us from the moment we left until we returned? Covid-19 restrictions have changed the way we interact with our dogs and cats. We\u2019ve spent so much time at home with them that it\u2019s easy to imagine they won\u2019t cope without us. Actually, says Black Hawk veterinarian Dr Lee Danks, we\u2019re probably not giving them enough credit. He says when life goes back to relative normality, our dogs and cats are probably going to be just fine, with a little consideration of course. Dogs and cats have complex feelings Dogs need social interaction for their wellbeing, Danks says. But their needs are more complicated than that. Healthy relationships between dogs and humans are similar to those between people: dogs need to spend time with us and without us. We\u2019re responsible for giving them space to just be dogs. \u201cIt\u2019s about realising that dogs and cats are also emotional animals,\u201d Danks says. \u201cFor us, having a pet reduces stress. Their companionship provides us with a sense of purpose or improves our fitness. But let\u2019s remember that it\u2019s a two-way street. While we have them for all those benefits, we need to respect that our dogs and cats have emotional sensitivities as well.\u201d For pet owners that means being open to the spectrum of your pet\u2019s feelings and considering their needs, not only in physical terms or at certain times, but as a whole. Separation anxiety is only one part of the equation Dogs and cats can exhibit destructive behaviours because we\u2019re not with them. But our absence is not necessarily the only reason for their behaviour, Danks says. \u201cIn pet behavioural circles, there\u2019s talk about separation-related disorders, because it\u2019s not always anxiety. A dog might go ahead and chew the arm off your couch and the cat may be intensely sharpening their claws on it, but they\u2019re loving it! They\u2019re having the time of their life.\u201d Common signs of separation disorders in pets are weeing and pooing where they shouldn\u2019t, chewing or digging/clawing, and vocalising (more common with dogs, who will bark, howl and whine). If we want to eliminate these behaviours, we need to uncover what motivates them, and what emotions drive them. Our pets might be frustrated and bored, or even be fearful of the situation. We might even have inadvertently trained them into it, reinforcing and rewarded their \u201cbad\u201d behaviour by giving them the attention they crave.

Anxiety is often related to the relationship between pet and human. \u201cWe call it \u2018hyper-attachment\u2019 when talking about a less-than-healthy reliance, which manifests in behavioural signs,\u201d Danks says. So, what should we be doing? Start preparing them before restrictions ease Dogs thrive on knowing what to expect. As soon as something changes, there\u2019s a flow-on effect. \u201cIn a dog\u2019s mind, if I don\u2019t get this resource, for example a meal, where am I going to get my next meal from?\u201d Danks says. \u201cAnd the one after that? Where am I going to get the other needs? It\u2019s a delicate balance. \u201cIf, during these weeks, we\u2019ve given our dogs constant attention, we\u2019ve created the rod for our own backs. We should think about slowly managing that expectation, and teaching them that alone time is OK, creating yet another take on the \u2018new normal\u2019. It\u2019s about that boring word: routine, routine, routine.\u201d Gradual training: You can get your pet used to being alone again by first leaving the house for just a few minutes, extending it to 15 minutes, then half an hour etc, and slowly increasing this time. Gradually your pet will learn to trust that you will return home again. Photograph: Ryan McVay/Getty Images. For cats, it\u2019s a slightly different story. While they have similar physical and emotional needs (with some interesting quirks), they\u2019re much bigger fans of place than people. \u201cCats like to know that the world will provide for them, rather than necessarily feeling indebted to a singular person. This is why they will happily take a meal from your neighbours, as long as it\u2019s in their established territory, and they know they\u2019ll be safe in that place.\u201d Even cats will benefit from a few practice sessions of returning to a more solitary life.

Promote a healthy relationship with your pet, every day As they say, prevention is better than cure. The best routine we can give our pet includes the right balance of companionship and social interaction (for dogs) or social availability (for cats), a healthy diet, ongoing health checks, a stress-free environment and the freedom to express normal behaviour. That might mean putting a bit more space between you and your pet, even if it\u2019s not always what you want. So how can you head back to work without turning your pet\u2019s world upside-down? Here are Danks\u2019s top tips: \u00b7 No sudden changes: make a slow transition between any two states, if you can. \u00b7 Be consistent: if you\u2019ve spent isolation taking your dog to the park or having the cat on your lap for an hour every day, keep doing it, if you can. \u00b7 Know and consider all of your pet\u2019s needs. \u00b7 Stay on top of their health and wellbeing. \u00b7 Negotiate for a pet-friendly office! \u201cThere\u2019s no quick fix,\u201d Danks says. \u201cJust as we\u2019ve helped them realise being with us is the new normal, we need to allow them to realise being alone is also OK. It\u2019s fine either way \u2013 they can be the dog or cat that they are regardless of our presence.\u201d Our pets are part of our family, but, just like children, they need to feel confident to make their own way in the world. Danks has simple words of advice for us all: \u201cAllow your dog to be a dog, or cat to be a cat. Enjoy them. That\u2019s why we have them in our lives.\u201d Black Hawk\u2019s natural, holistic pet food range makes sure your dog gets everything they need, and nothing they don\u2019t.
