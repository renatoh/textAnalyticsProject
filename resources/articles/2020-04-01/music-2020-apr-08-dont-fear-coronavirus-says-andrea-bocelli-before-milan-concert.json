Bocelli, 61, told the Guardian he was not qualified to give advice to fellow citizens but he was willing to describe how he was coping with the lockdown. \u201cDuring moments like this, as we are forced to stay at home, we have to grasp the opportunity to do things that often we would like to do, but which we don\u2019t have time for,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s begin: speak to your children, and try with all your strength to create a family harmony that often is not there because dialogue is missing.\u201d He added: \u201cRead, listen to music, try to keep the body and mind very active and, last but not least, do not be afraid of a virus that will pass, in the same way that you wouldn\u2019t be afraid when you get behind the wheel of your car, knowing that throughout the year there are so many road victims.\u201d Milan\u2019s cathedral is closed under the lockdown but will open its doors on Sunday to Bocelli and the organist Emanuele Vianelli, who will play one of the world\u2019s largest pipe organs. The event begins at 7pm local time (1800 BST) and will be streamed live on YouTube. The repertoire of songs will include Ave Maria (Bach/Gounod) and Pietro Mascagni\u2019s Sancta Maria. The concert is being hosted by the Milan authorities and the Veneranda Fabbrica del Duomo, which supervises the cathedral. \u201cThis year, Easter will be very different for all of us,\u201d Beppe Sala, the mayor of Milan, said in a statement. \u201cThe joyous serenity that usually comes with this day has been greatly troubled by the pandemic that we\u2019re experiencing. I am sure that the extraordinary voice of Bocelli will be the embrace we are missing these days, a strong, special hug capable of warming the heart of Milan, Italy and the world.\u201d Bocelli has been raising funds through his Andrea Bocelli Foundation (ABF) for hospitals and protective equipment during the pandemic, which has so far killed 17,127 people in Italy. The foundation set up a GoFundMe page and within a few days collected \u20ac100,000 (\u00a388,000) to purchase medical equipment for a hospital in Camerino, in the Marche region of central-eastern Italy, where the foundation had already been reconstructing schools destroyed in an earthquake in 2016. Since it was established in 2011, the foundation has raised more than \u20ac30m for projects around the world. \u201cFor me, ABF is an important opportunity to do important things which alone I wouldn\u2019t be able to do,\u201d Bocelli said. \u201cI often say, \u2018You can do many things alone, but with many others you can do much more.\u2019 Therefore, the scope of ABF is to gather even more resources, involving around 70 people who with goodwill together raise funds, but also ideas, desires and dreams.\u201d Bocelli will also join a lineup of celebrities including Elton John, Chris Martin of Coldplay, Paul McCartney and Lady Gaga for One World: Together at Home, a livestreamed and televised benefit concert in support of the World Health Organization\u2019s Covid-19 solidarity response fund and in celebration of health workers around the world. Curated by Lady Gaga, the event will be broadcast live on the US TV networks ABC, CBS and NBC, as well as being streamed online, from 8pm EST on 18 April. In the UK, BBC One will show an adapted version of the concert on 19 April, including exclusive performances from British artists and interviews with frontline health workers. Last week Bocelli performed Con te partir\u00f2 (Time to Say Goodbye) from his home for James Corden\u2019s The Late Late Show. In the past the tenor has given impromptu performances, including walking into a church in Porto Venere, Liguria, in 2015 and surprising a just-married couple with a rendition of Ave Maria. There have been 135,586 cases of coronavirus in Italy to date, and the growth rate for new infections has been slowing. Italy\u2019s lockdown is in place until at least 13 April and will probably be extended."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
