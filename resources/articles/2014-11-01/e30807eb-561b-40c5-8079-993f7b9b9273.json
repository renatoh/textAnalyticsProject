Growing up in South Africa taught them much about the Springbok psyche, particularly in the wake of a result such as last weekend\u2019s loss in Ireland. The \u201cbig green machine\u201d, as Catt describes the visiting Bok side, is going to take some stopping. Luckily, as every Saracens fan knows, England have just the man for such an assignment. Barritt has not gained a reputation as the best midfield tackler in the country for nothing \u2013 there is only one man to call if defence is the overriding priority. Yet as the 28-year-old made clear he is growing increasingly tired of being pigeon-holed as little more than a blocker or an oval-ball Chopper Harris. \u201cSometimes I think it is just an easy thing to write,\u201d he said, following up with a string of valid reasons why England should be glad to have him. The steely edge to his voice merely highlighted England\u2019s own determination to bounce back strongly from disappointment last weekend. With Kyle Eastmond restored to health, the possibility of playing Owen Farrell and George Ford in the same XV is now only likely to materialise in the second half, leaving Barritt and Eastmond to build on a partnership which largely kept Sonny Bill Williams and Conrad Smith quiet last Saturday. It remains to be seen how long they stay together but Barritt believes the best centre pairings have to anchor their team in times of trouble as well as supply a keen attacking edge. \u201cReliability is important in the Test arena because it is often about small margins,\u201d he says. \u201cHaving players who bring people together as a linchpin in attack and defence is what you need. I sometimes think that what is said about me is unwarranted, because I try to bring what is needed on the day to win a Test.\u201d Catt also knows how it feels to be unappreciated in an England shirt \u2013 \u201cHow many times did I go in and out?\u201d \u2013 but the World Cup-winning centre, now the team\u2019s attacking skills coach, remains a firm supporter. \u201cBrad does the simple things very well. He carries the ball well and what he brings to the team is what you don\u2019t see. It is not about him on the ball \u2013 it is what he does around the ball and how he makes the team feel. You can\u2019t underestimate defence in international rugby. Every team that has won the World Cup has had the best defence, not the best attack. You need people like Brad. He is composed and everybody feels very comfortable with him around.\u201d It was a sizeable endorsement, particularly given the fact Luther Burrell and Billy Twelvetrees combined so well in last season\u2019s Six Nations. With Manu Tuilagi injured again, there are also some who would prefer England to opt for all-out attack in the form of Eastmond and his Bath colleague Jonathan Joseph, whose understanding at club level is an increasing joy. Test rugby is different, though, and the intensity of Saturday\u2019s game demands precisely the coolness under pressure which Barritt has always possessed. He spent the early years of his career with the Natal Sharks, playing alongside the Du Plessis brothers and JP Pietersen, but his Anglo-Rhodesian heritage meant Jeremy Guscott was one of his heroes as a kid. Barritt was also a young spectator in Durban in 1997 when Guscott dropped the goal which clinched series victory for the Lions. While pairing the names Brad and Kyle may sound more like the cast list of Home and Away, seven years in London have ensured the former\u2019s loyalty to England will not be diluted this weekend. \u201cI\u2019m truly integrated into this England team,\u201d Barritt insists. \u201cI\u2019ve been involved since 2009 and it is definitely where I consider home. I guess there is an added incentive against the country of your birth but every Test for England is important. You don\u2019t prioritise. There are players I have played with in the past and that is always an interesting dynamic \u2026 but once you get out on the pitch that goes out the window.\u201d Barritt also promises there will be no texting the opposition like Kevin Pietersen in the run-up to a game England would love to win. Catt would settle for a 3-0 scoreline if necessary but wants his players to have the courage of their convictions. \u201cWe went into our shells a little bit on the weekend and we are all aware of that. That is frustrating but we know where we can correct it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is not broken and we will continue to play with tempo. You can\u2019t run through South Africa. Can we match them for passion and ferocity? We don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
