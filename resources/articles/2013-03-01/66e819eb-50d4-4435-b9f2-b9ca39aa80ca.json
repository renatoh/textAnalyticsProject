We can only hope so", "bodyText": "Given that a park unofficially known as Stalin World exists in Lithuania, one hesitates to say that no one does eccentric tourist attractions like the Brits. However, we do boast the Cumberland Pencil Museum and the Yelverton Paperweight Centre. In Southport lies the British Lawnmower Museum, which houses Jean Alexander's Qualcast Panther, while visitors to Bovey Tracey in Devon can marvel at the House of Marbles. There are Diggerlands in three separate locations. To this esteemed list, it may soon be possible to add the Lewis Hamilton Museum to Lewis Hamilton. Though Formula One's erstwhile champion has yet to break ground on this most self-effacing of personal tributes, it is much in that kaleidoscope mind of his as he prepares for his first season with Mercedes. \"I have been thinking to build a museum,\" he announced to journalists. Of the trophies it would house, Hamilton observed that \"there's no point having them in your house where no one can see them. Or,\" he continued, warming to his theme, \"am I going to have to build a house big enough because I have hundreds of trophies?\" It's a taxing dilemma (dilemmas being one of the few things that tax this Monaco resident). If pushed, I think I'd prefer Lewis to purchase Castle Howard and call the next volume of his autobiography Muttonhead Revisited. But you may care to pick your own -head prefix, obviously. In part, of course, these affectations are the fashion of the times. Geri Halliwell had written two autobiographies by the age of 30. If you are wondering what a 28-year\u2011old already planning a museum to his personage does next, I'm sure Lewis would advise you to refuse to accept the limits other people place on you. Perhaps for his 40th birthday he will begin construction of a mausoleum atop the aforementioned museum. Maybe he'll even go the whole hog and commission a pyramid. Whatever he does, though, there should be a keen sense of anticipation for this Hamilton Mk II, who is styling himself as freer, faster, and altogether franker. How long the candour will be permitted to last after this first outing is anyone's guess, but the prospect of almost any bigtime sports star being allowed to wholly speak his brains is such a rarity that we should surrender to the moment. Just like showbiz, sport needs its grotesques \u2013 in fact, it positively requires the monsters to throw the vast majority of fellow top level pros into the sympathetic relief they deserve. He clearly doesn't realise it, but Hamilton now sounds as if he is being written by a parodist. He has requested (and been granted) an F1 access pass for his bulldog, Roscoe. He has commissioned a red paint job on his new private jet. Why? Because he does things \"properly\". But that commitment to super-rich excellence is not without its emotional burdens. \"I will die if [Roscoe] does a turd in my plane,\" he reveals. \"I will have to get the whole plane changed.\" If you're honest, wouldn't you secretly like to read much, much more of this? The good news is that you might be able to. \"I feel that I can express myself better nowadays, be more myself,\" Hamilton declares of his emancipation from those micromanagers at McLaren. \"I have come from a place where there was a lot of control, where you had to do what you were told.\" How restrictive of his true self that must have seemed. Indeed, reading this first salvo from the liberated Lewis, I can't help but be reminded of the dissolved relationship between Mr Tom Cruise and his legendary publicist Pat Kingsley. For 14 years, Kingsley was the PR mastermind who controlled all media access to Cruise. Copy approval, no interviews without guarantee of getting the mag cover, legal ownership of journalists' copy - she got 'em all, and Cruise's star soared ever higher, the mainstream effectively untroubled by suggestions of an unhelpful nature. Then, in 2004, the actor parted company with Kingsley. Within a year, he had dementedly surfed Oprah's sofa, denounced Brooke Shields for medicating her postnatal depression \u2013 \"there is no science behind that\" \u2013 and it wouldn't be long before he was starring in a fantastically unsettling leaked Scientology video. In each of these outings he expressed himself more openly than the wise Kingsley would ever have dreamed of letting him in a million years. He is now regarded as one of the foremost celebrity loons of the age, if not the very foremost. And would we have it any other way? Well of course we wouldn't. We will play out with Hamilton's inevitable pitch for the mantle of Ayrton Senna. \"I am my own personality,\" he concedes after a discourse on Senna's aura, \"but I hope to achieve that greatness.\" The sharp-eyed among you, of course, will have noticed that Lewis has made a category mistake. Senna's effortless magnetism is not something one \"achieves\", as though it were a grid position or a bench-pressing personal best. To put it another way, anyone TRYING to be like Ayrton Senna ain't anything like Ayrton Senna. Still, on current form, I very much hope Lewis Hamilton will continue being Lewis Hamilton. If he refuses to add to the exchequer's revenues, he can certainly add to the gaiety of the nation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
