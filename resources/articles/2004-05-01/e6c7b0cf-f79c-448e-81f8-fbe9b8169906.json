Michael Chapman's three-year-old put a moderate Windsor run behind him when chasing home Nessen Dorma at Doncaster last time. He has a good draw in stall 12, unlike one of his main rivals, Alaloof, who caught the eye when staying on into fourth at Bath last time. A form line involving Nessen Dorma and Gavroche gives Siegfrieds Night the beating of the progressive Meadaaf, a big danger with Kieren Fallon on board. Enchantment and Dispol Katie fought out the finish of a valuable sales race at Doncaster last season when on opposite sides of the track and both ran well enough on their reappearances to suggest they have trained on. Enchantment has the better of the weights but Dispol Katie may be the more forward of the pair in the Fillies' Handicap (3.30). Simianna is another to consider after a slightly unlucky second at Chester but does not look as favourably drawn as the other pair. Petrula also ran well at Chester without looking like getting to grips with tough front-runner Guilded Flyer and has been lucky with the draw in the Middleham Trainers Association Handicap (3.00). Leighton, whose trainer James Bethell sent out Mine and Crathorne to be placed in handicaps at York's Dante meeting, could repay each-way support in the same event. Mick Easterby has a couple of potentially well-handicapped animals in Broadway Score and the ex-Irish Arawan but both have disadvantageous low draws. Broadway Score won the Rosebery Handicap off a mark of 95 for John Hills just over a year ago, yet is now down to 80 and is sure to find an opening soon. There is classier fare at Longchamp with a recording of the French 2,000 Guineas (3.30), on BBC2. American Post should keep his unbeaten record, possibly at Byron's expense. Andre Fabre's Grey Lilas has Carry On Katie, sixth in the 1,000 Guineas, to beat in the Fillies' Classic at 2.50."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
