That was three months ago and I am nearly ready to take decisions, having worked through the summer on the options. That's why the clamour last week that 'something must be done' was ridiculous. Some seem to think that because there is a flood of publicity, I should produce a rabbit out of the hat. Where, after 12 weeks, the commentators ask, was the rethink? We have reached a point in the media circus where a Minister cannot pause for careful thought without being branded 'uncertain' or, in the words of one leader writer, 'bewildered'. We will not make policy on the hoof. Give me the time to announce coherent policies that make up a jigsaw of national action, European-wide and co-ordinated programmes and an international perspective that addresses the 1951 UN Convention. I am not asking for a year's grace, just the opportunity to announce policy in a thought-through and structured fashion. This week is an important one as we tackle the problems posed to Western Europe by the volume of people moving from one side of the world to the other. My meeting with the French Interior Minister will be a forerunner of much closer co-operation needed between EU governments. I will also be unveiling a package of security measures for our ports and continuing my work on our review of asylum policy. We need to work with the French Government, not only in tackling the immediate build-up of men and women at Sangatte, but also on how to win collaboration on wider border controls and trafficking. It takes no thought or sophistication to satisfy an emotional spasm by 'having a go at the French'. It takes a little more deliberation to work through how best to get moves under way that will yield results as opposed to short-term political gains. One area where British-led, European-wide action is about to bear fruit is in tackling people-smuggling through the Balkans, which is one of the main entry points for illegal immigrants into the EU. I want to change the work permit system to ensure we can deal with sensible economic migration. That will work alongside revised asylum policies which match our desire to provide a sensitive welcome and safe haven to those who face persecution and death across the world, while having rigorous and hard-headed policies that send the right signals to those who do not. That is why we must deal effectively with applications while ensuring those who fail the test are removed quickly and effectively. I was deeply disturbed by Friday's High Court ruling against the Oakington centre which fast-tracks asylum applications in one of the best-equipped and most humane centres of its kind in the world. We face big challenges which are more important than any newspaper deadline. I am prepared to listen, learn and respond to these issues if, through the British media, we can debate them in a manner worthy of a civilised country in the twenty-first century.
