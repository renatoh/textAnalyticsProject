Just 12 months ago, Eddie Murphy found himself hotly tipped to win the best supporting actor Oscar for his role in Dreamgirls, only to lose out on the night to Alan Arkin. Yet this weekend the actor found himself as one of the industry's most dishonoured stars, picking up a trio of \"Razzies\" at the 28th annual Golden Raspberry awards. Murphy was named worst actor, worst supporting actor and worst supporting actress for his work on the reputed comedy Norbit. Clearly subscribing to the view that nothing succeeds like excess, the film gave audiences three Murphies for the price of one, casting him as a nerdish hero, his overweight wife, and a Chinese restaurant manager. Norbit received scathing reviews on its release last year, although Guardian critic Peter Bradshaw admitted a sneaking fondness for the film. \"I have to confess that I did laugh occasionally,\" he wrote. The other big \"winner\" was Lindsay Lohan, whose alleged thriller I Know Who Killed Me led the field with eight razzies, including worst picture, worst actress and worst director. The glittering ceremony took place on Saturday at the Abracadabra theatre in Santa Monica, California. To no one's great surprise, neither Murphy or Lohan were available to collect their awards."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
