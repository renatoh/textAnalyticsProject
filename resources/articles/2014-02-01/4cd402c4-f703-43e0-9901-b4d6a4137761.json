Thirty years after he first took home the coveted prize, the 67-year-old singer-songwriter became the oldest recipient of a Brit award on a night that saw the old guard outshine music's young starlets. Bowie, who broke a decade's silence with his cerebral comeback album The Next Day last February, beat competition from young up-and-comers Jake Bugg, John Newman, Tom Odell and James Blake to win the award. Announcing Bowie had won, Noel Gallagher said: \"You maniacs didn't think David Bowie was actually going to be here? David Bowie's too cool for that \u2013 he doesn't do this shit.\" Instead Kate Moss collected the award on his behalf. Wearing the singer's Ziggy Stardust 'rabbit costume' designed by Kansai Yamamoto, the model read out a speech in which Bowie thanked fans and made a surprise intervention in the Scottish independence debate: \"David has asked me to say this: In Japanese myth, the rabbits on my old costume that Kate's wearing live on the moon. Kate comes from Venus, and I from Mars. \"I'm completely delighted to have a Brit for being the best male. I think it's a great way to end the day. Thank you very much \u2013 and Scotland, stay with us.\" On a night that returned an element of surprise to a ceremony criticised for its uniformity, five-time Brit winner Prince appeared briefly on stage to deafening applause inside London's O2 arena. Standing beside his leather-clad backing band 3RDEYEGIRL, the diminutive pop maestro thanked London for making him feel \"extra loved\" and handed out the best British female award to an awestruck Ellie Goulding. \"Prince!\" she gasped, clutching her award as he left the stage. Beyonc\u00e9 also made an unannounced appearance, leading a rapt audience of fans and music executives through a soaring singalong of her latest single XO. The annual celebration of British music marked a historic double for the Arctic Monkeys, who became the first act to win best British band and best British album in three separate years, beating past winners Coldplay and Manic Street Preachers. The impeccably-coifed rockers from Sheffield opened the ceremony in bombastic style, launching into their hit single R U Mine? on a spectacular fire-throwing set in the middle of the arena. Accepting the award for best British group, frontman Alex Turner said: \"Well, there's that 15 quid we put on One Direction to win down the drain, innit?\" London four-piece Bastille and dance duo Disclosure were tipped to sweep the boards with four nominations apiece, but Bastille took home the two groups' only award \u2013 for British breakthrough act. Bastille frontman Dan Smith thanked \"everyone we know\" and, in a nod to last year's ceremony when the band were only given one seat, said: \"This time last year I don't think anyone in this room thought we would even be here. We're gonna leave now, we're gonna shut up.\" One Direction continued their journey from X Factor hopefuls to international pop icons, as they took the Global Success award for the second year in a row. Harry Styles was late on stage to collect the statuette. The 20-year-old heartthrob said: \"I'm really sorry, I was having a wee. The toilets are ages away.\" In a night of surprises, comedian James Corden carefully navigated through his fourth and final turn as Brits host without mishap or controversy. The Gavin &amp; Stacey star showed no sign of going through the motions, interrupting Prince on-stage to take a selfie \u2013 which he subsequently tweeted \u2013 and using Arctic Monkeys' pyrotechnics to set his arm alight, albeit as a joke. But all the talk was of Bowie-mania. His award was hailed by music critics who contrasted the ingenuity of the Ziggy Stardust singer to the Radio 2-friendly crop of younger male stars. \"What this proves is that the way Bowie engineered his comeback was a stroke of genius,\" said music writer Simon Price. \"The way he sprang his single on the world without any publicity or hype and managed to keep it a secret is unheard of in the modern world. It created such a buzz that it pretty much confirms 2013 as International David Bowie Year.\" Price said the accolade was perhaps a sentimental vote by industry judges, but was critical about the calibre of competition in this year's best male category. \"The fact he's defeated them just proves that young artists these days are actually more boring than someone three times their age \u2013 and that's a damning indictment of them.\" If last year's ceremony went down as one of the dullest ever, last night's showpiece attempted to regain some showbiz sparkle with centrepieces including a 2.8-metre mirror ball, 10,000 balloons and 30 lasers zigzagging throughout the televised show. Stars drank from 4,000 china tea cups at the official Brits after party \u2013 a sign perhaps that the ceremony's colourful history of chaos, insults and stage invasions are a thing of the past. Awards also went to 21-year-old singer-songwriter Sam Smith, dance act Rudimental, and One Direction, who won the best video award, as voted for live on the night on social media. International winners included US singer Bruno Mars, who won international male solo artist, group award winners Daft Punk, and 17-year-old Lorde from New Zealand, who defied more established stars such as Lady Gaga and Katy Perry to scoop the international female solo artist. Other performers on the night included award winners Goulding, Mars, Bastille and Rudimental, as well as Katy Perry, whose set resembled an Aztec scene with fluorescent dance outfits and laser beams."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
