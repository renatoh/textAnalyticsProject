His team face Slovakia and Cyprus at the Millennium Stadium over the next five days in matches which are crucial if they are to maintain any real hope of qualifying for Euro 2008. Wales have scored only once in their last three games, an own goal in the 2-1 defeat against the Czech Republic, but Toshack has called on his own experiences with Liverpool during the 70s. \"I remember Bill Shankly calling me aside and he said, 'Never be frightened to miss. You must always go into the penalty area. If you go in and miss one, you go in with more determination the next time.' I think it's probably the best bit of advice I ever had as a forward player.\" Craig Bellamy and Robert Earnshaw are likely to spearhead the Welsh attack, but Toshack has also highlighted the importance of the likes of Jason Koumas and Joe Ledley in midfield, particularly in the absence of Ryan Giggs. \"You can't rely on one or two people,\" he said. \"If we were going to make an impact at all in the group, we would look to be winning these home games.\" Injuries mean Toshack will make five enforced changes from the team which played the opening Euro 2008 qualifier. Giggs, James Collins, Mark Delaney, Sam Ricketts and Carl Fletcher - who hopes to resume training today - are all unavailable to start tomorrow. \"I've still got some selection problems and some nice ones,\" said Toshack, \"if I get it right, I think we will win the game.\" Simon Davies's lack of regular first-team matches with Everton is also a concern. Toshack could conceivably turn to Cardiff's Paul Parry, although Davies is likely to keep his place against Slovakia. \"I know Simon's situation at Everton is not something he can be entirely happy with and there will come a time, undoubtedly, when it will affect him,\" said Toshack, \"Enthusiasm can get you by, certainly in one game. Two in four days is another thing.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
