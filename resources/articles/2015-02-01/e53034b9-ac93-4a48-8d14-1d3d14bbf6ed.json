Australia announced on Thursday that four Sri Lankan asylum seekers had been transferred at sea to the custody of the Sri Lankan navy after their boat was intercepted earlier this month north-west of the Cocos Islands. The men were interviewed at sea by Australian immigration officials, regarding their asylum claims. It is not known when they will reach Sri Lanka. Historically, asylum seekers forcibly repatriated to Sri Lanka have been taken from Colombo airport or the harbour to which they were returned directly to prison or to court, where they appeared before a magistrate and were usually charged with illegally leaving the country. The minister of justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said the administration of new president Maithripala Sirisena, elected in January, had no immediate plans to change policy towards returned asylum seekers. \u201cWe have not discussed that at all, and such a change is not within the 100 days program of the new government and is not a priority. So there is unlikely to be any change soon. Any returning illegal asylum seeker would have to face the legal process of the country,\u201d Rajapakshe said. According to returnees and lawyers, it is usually the \u201cfacilitators\u201d of asylum seeker boats \u2013 those skippering and operating the boats, not the kingpins who organised the trip \u2013 who are refused bail in Sri Lankan courts. Behind the boat skippers, the ultimate organisers of the asylum seeker journeys are rarely caught, but senior members of the Sri Lankan navy have consistently been alleged to be involved. Four serving members of the Sri Lankan navy, including a commander who had briefed Australian authorities on anti-smuggling measures, have been arrested and charged with people-smuggling. Fare-paying passengers are usually bailed out. But their cases often spend years before the courts, with regular appearances before magistrates, often in courtrooms far from their homes. Ultimately, asylum seekers are usually fined, but not jailed. \u201cUsually the so-called facilitators of journey, like captain of the boat and helpers are kept in remand prison, others who were passengers are released on bail,\u201d Lakshan Dias, a Colombo-based lawyer who has represented returned asylum seekers, told the Guardian. \u201cBut we had cases of even passengers being tortured and brutalised while in the custody of the Sri Lankan forces. Once these cases are concluded, a passenger usually ends up having to pay a fine of 100,000 Sri Lankan rupees (A$965), that is on top of whatever amount they paid for the journey.\u201d The average annual income in Sri Lanka is just over A$3,800 Ruwan Rangana, a former asylum seeker from Angunakolapelessa, in the southern Hambantota district, was returned to Sri Lanka last year, after the boat he was travelling on was intercepted by the Australian navy. He had paid 200,000 rupees, about A$1,930, for his passage to Australia, and had been at sea 15 days when he was intercepted. \u201cOnce we were handed over to the [Sri Lankan] navy, we were brought ashore. First the navy recorded a statement, then the Criminal Investigation Department recorded statements. We were brought ashore at the southern port of Galle. \u201cWe were never put in prison or in a jail cell, we just waited inside the police station. We were produced in court and bailed after paying R5,000 (A$47). My next court date is in May. My lawyers said case could go on for even five years. The people who organised the trip, like the trawler captain and the helpers, were not bailed out.\u201d The four Sri Lankan asylum seekers currently at sea were interviewed at sea by border protection personnel to determine if they were refugees and requiring Australia\u2019s protection. The interviews were then assessed by senior officials at the immigration department. \u201cAll four illegal maritime arrivals were found eligible for return, consistent with Australia\u2019s non-refoulement obligations,\u201d a release by the immigration minister Peter Dutton\u2019s office said. \u201cAll persons aboard the [vessel] were safe and accounted for at all times and at no stage was the vessel in distress.\u201d Australia cannot, under international law, send refugees back to countries in which they may face harm. The so-called enhanced screening process of interviewing asylum seekers at sea began under Labor and has continued under the Coalition\u2019s Operation Sovereign Borders policy. \u201cBy working closely with our regional partners we save lives at sea and prevent vulnerable people being lied to and ripped off by people smugglers,\u201d Dutton said. \u201cThe Coalition government\u2019s policies and resolve are stopping illegal boat arrivals and are restoring integrity to Australia\u2019s borders and immigration program. Anyone attempting to enter Australia illegally by sea will never be resettled in this country,\u201d Dutton said. The high court ruled on-water transfer operations were legal in a judgement delivered in January. But the United Nation\u2019s high commissioner for refugees says screening of asylum seekers at sea is inadequate. \u201cUNHCR\u2019s position is that they [asylum seekers intercepted at sea] must be swiftly and individually screened, in a process which they understand and in which they are able to explain their needs. Such screening is best carried out on land, given safety concerns and other limitations of doing so at sea.\u201d Bala Vigneswaran from the Australian Tamil Congress said interviewing people at sea was against international law because it denied people the right to ask questions, seek legal representation and contest the findings. \u201cI believe we should give people the best chance to state their case,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. \u201cA short interview on the high seas won\u2019t give them that opportunity. \u201cIt is not the right process \u2026 there\u2019s no way it is acceptable.\u201d Vigneswaran acknowledges that the situation in Sri Lanka for Tamils has improved since former president Mahinda Rajapaksa\u2019s shock election defeat in January. New president Sirisena was elected with the support of the country\u2019s minorities, including Tamils and Muslims. But Vigneswaran said Sri Lanka was still not stable and peaceful, and expressed concerns about sending asylum seekers back. Trevor Grant from the Tamil Refugee Council said it was a \u201cfantasy\u201d that interviews at sea were consistent with Australia\u2019s obligations under the refugees convention. \u201cAs was outlined late last month by two of the 40 asylum seekers on one boat Australia returned to Sri Lanka last year, this so-called \u2018enhanced screening\u2019 process is an outrageous breach of their rights. One of the men revealed that the phone dropped out \u201810 to 15 times\u2019 during his interview and he struggled to hear the person on the other end of the line.\u201d Late last month Dutton confirmed that 15 boats had been turned back since the start of Operation Sovereign Borders. Only one vessel had arrived in Australia during 2014."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
