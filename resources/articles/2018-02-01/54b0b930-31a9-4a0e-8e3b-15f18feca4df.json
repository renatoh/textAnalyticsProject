Perhaps rusty after recent injury 6 Willian Chelsea\u2019s most threatening player all night, scurrying forward and battering shots against both posts before whipping in the hosts\u2019 opener 8 Eden Hazard The hosts were always happiest when he was scurrying up-field, but he felt wasted as a false No9 7 Pedro Charged with snapping at Ter Stegen and also screening passes into Messi, he worked tirelessly and selflessly 7 Barcelona Marc-Andre ter Stegen Either fortunate or demonstrating sound judgment as Willian\u2019s shots cannoned from both his posts, and unsighted at the Brazilian\u2019s opener 6 Sergi Roberto Pushed forward at will, but prone to rash decisions at the back and it was his error which presented Willian with his second chance 5 Gerard Piqu\u00e9 A calming influence helping Umtiti at his side, but might have been more tested up against a recognised striker 6 Samuel Umtiti Occasionally exposed on the turn, and the 24-year-old is a weakness Chelsea must surely target in the return 6 Jordi Alba A marauding presence up the flank, linking up with the central suppliers, to stretch the home side\u2019s rearguard 7 Sergio Busquets Tidy enough in possession for possession\u2019s sake, cynical when he had to be, but exposed when opponents spun off him 6 Ivan Rakitic Impressive in partnership with Iniesta and Messi, and constantly available, but more cautious after his yellow card 7 Paulinho Planted a header horribly wide and generally underwhelmed. Life in England deflates the former Tottenham midfielder 4 Andr\u00e9s Iniesta Was at the heart of everything positive Bar\u00e7a mustered with his interchanges with Messi and Rakitic making them tick 7 Luis Su\u00e1rez The Uruguayan has now gone 881 minutes without a goal in this competition and, one turn away from Christensen aside, was becalmed 5 Lionel Messi Ninth time lucky for the Argentinian against Chelsea. At times it took two or three markers to stifle his threat 7"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
