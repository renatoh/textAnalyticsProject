The president appeared at two campaign rallies in support of Jon Corzine, a former chief executive of the Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs who is battling for a second term as Democratic governor of the usually solidly \"blue\" state of New Jersey, but who is in trouble over the dismal condition of the state's economy. Appealing to a crowd of 5,500 people in the city of Camden, Obama said Corzine was an important partner in helping the White House deliver on its programme. \"He's one of the best partners I have in the White House. We work together,\" said Obama. \"We know our work is far from over.\" Opinion polls show Corzine in a statistical dead heat with his Republican rival, Chris Christie, after a bitter campaign that has featured accusations of ethical violations, and television advertisements by Democrats that zeroed in on Christie's rotund physique. Squeezing the most out of his personal popularity, Obama has made five appearances in support of Corzine, anxious to secure a victory at the ballot box on Tuesday, when the Democrats are heading for defeat in a battle for governor in another populous state, Virginia. The votes will be the first large-scale opportunity to gauge popular sentiment since Obama was inaugurated in January. There is concern in Democratic circles that the results could be disappointing, with Obama's plans for healthcare reform proving divisive and frustration over delays in delivering other campaign promises. \"Republicans are energised everywhere because anger is a better motivator than approval of the party in power,\" said Dave Wasserman, a political analyst at the non-partisan Cook Political Report. Keen to avoid a clean sweep of defeats, Obama followed his Camden rally with a second appearance before 11,000 people in Newark tonight. A poll released today showed Corzine trailing Christie by 42% to 43%, with support for an independent, Chris Daggett, in double figures. New Jersey has been badly hit by falling house prices and by the recession, but the president urged voters not to blame the governor for the state's financial ills. \"It wasn't a consequence of Obama policies, or Corzine policies, that we went into this hole,\" said Obama. \"There seems to be some selective memory going on here.\" Corzine, a multi-millionaire from his years in investment banking, has spent more than $23m on campaigning, twice as much as his rival, including a blizzard of negative advertisements on television. One set of Democratic attack ads accused Corzine's challenger of \"throwing his weight around\" while serving as a public prosecutor, to get out of paying traffic tickets. The voiceover accompanied unflattering footage of the Republican's girth and was widely interpreted as a comment on Christie's physical condition. The picture looks grim for Democrats elsewhere. Although Obama beat his presidential rival, John McCain in Virginia last year, the state's Democratic candidate for governor, Creigh Deeds, is trailing a Republican contender by between 13 and 18 points in the polls. In a lower key race for a congressional district in upstate New York, a moderate Republican candidate dropped out at the last minute this week after criticism from figures including Sarah Palin that she was too liberal on issues such as gay marriage and abortion \u2013 a sign that Republicans continue to struggle for unity. Also on Tuesday, voters in New York city will choose a mayor, with the billionaire Michael Bloomberg heading for a comfortable third-term victory. Bloomberg controversially pushed for a change in the law to end rules limiting the city's mayors to two terms in office."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
