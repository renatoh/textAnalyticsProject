How to be a Good Mother with Sharon Horgan (Channel 4)? Really? Isn't that a bit like How to be Sober with Freddie Flintoff? Or How to be Likable with Piers Morgan? It's not just a lesson though. Sharon's visiting other mums with different ideas, to see how they do it. She goes to see Lynnea, a \"natural mother\" and placenta enthusiast. Lynnea makes fruit smoothies out of them for new mums \u2013 mmm, afterbirth and banana. And nice little umbilical cord charms to hang in the window. So cute. Next there's Daria, a stay-at-home \"continuum mum\", who believes that a mother should never be separated from her baby. Daria also believes in \"elimination communication\" which, roughly translated, means not wearing nappies. But the mother of all stay-at-home mothers is Charlene, who, by the age of 27, has got six kids, all home-schooled and called some combination of her name and husband Terry's \u2013 Techar, Chartel, Charmar, Cherry, Telsee, and Chantee. There's another on the way \u2013 presumably to be called Terylene, though don't tell \"natural mother\" Lynnea. There are more. Fiorella is a stay-at-work mum. But she's also a techno-mum, and she schedules in a video conference with her two-year-old son every day. She also has the most terrifying to-do board I have ever seen. \"I don't play the wishing game, I play the managing-expectation game,\" she says. Then there's Aimi, who fits neatly into the \"overprotective pole-dancing mum\" category. And finally, my favourite, wicked stepmother Antonia Pugh-Thomas (she gets a surname because she's proper posh). Antonia P-T is a qualified stunt woman, and a dress designer. She never wanted kids \u2013 always thought they were \"a bit creepy\" \u2013 but suddenly found herself with three \u2013 two step, one hers. No problem, she's got dogs, children are just the same. They're all mad \u2013 crazy women with crazy ideas and crazy names. You can see that Sharon is half-thinking that, but also half-thinking that maybe there's something in what they say. She's very good like that \u2013 at both taking seriously and taking the piss, all at the same time. She's also taking the piss out of herself, as much as she is out of everyone else. And she's very funny (yeah, all right, I do have a little thing about Horgan, I don't mind admitting). And the brilliant thing is that because she's with all these loons she comes across as being an absolutely brilliant mum. As I'm sure she is. I'm sure they all are, really. Here's another person it's impossible not to like. Not larking about with a pint or pie-eyed on a pedalo this time, because this is Freddie Flintoff: Hidden Side of Sport (BBC1). He's talking about depression \u2013 other sportsmen's and his own (the pedalo incident came during one of his lowest periods). It's a fantastic cast he has assembled \u2013 fellow cricketer Steve Harmison, Celtic manager Neil Lennon, snooker champion Graeme Dott, footballer turned Hollywood bad guy Vinnie Jones, boxers Barry McGuigan and Ricky Hatton (who seems to live inside a giant house-sized trophy cabinet). It's great that these hard, famous men are talking so openly and eloquently about something that no one would have admitted to a few years ago, a sign of changing attitudes. Flintoff himself is particularly good on the problem for high-profile sports people \u2013 of having this big, shiny public persona, the unflappable hero, when actually it's not like that at all underneath. The media hasn't always been helpful. Piers Morgan says he would have found it ridiculous that someone with the enormous privilege and honour of playing for his country and who was staying in five-star hotels could claim to be depressed. Yes, Piers, because happiness is mainly about 24-hour room service, a minibar, uniformed doormen and valet parking ... But that was then, and things are different now, he says. Newspapers have become more responsible since (because?) Piers left. He now knows a lot more about it, he says, realises that sportsmen are human beings too ... Hang on, is this a new Piers Morgan? Sensitive, sensible, humble, hands-up, \"we were wrong\"? Nah, I'm not having that. Look at him, he's still a cock."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
