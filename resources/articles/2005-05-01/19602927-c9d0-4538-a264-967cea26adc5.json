The news emerged on the day the chairman revealed that his \"prudently managed\" club would enforce 50% wage cuts on the overwhelming majority of players and redundancies on a number of ancillary staff. Far from succumbing to the demands of a 1,000-strong throng of Southampton fans who called for his resignation on Sunday night, Lowe is clinging to a post that earned him \u00a3406,513 in salaries, bonuses and benefits in 2003. \"I've never quit in my life and I'm not about to start quitting now. In the same way as when we got to the [2003 FA] Cup final I did not take all the glory, I don't think I should take all of the blame,\" said Lowe. \"I think it is fair to say that everybody will accept and shoulder their share of what ever pain we have to take. You will all be able to see whether or not that happens because it is a public company. But I think that [decision is] a matter for the board.\" The managing director Andrew Cowen told Lowe yesterday that he could expect reduced terms. \"I would think that [executive pay cuts are] a probability rather than a possibility,\" said Cowen. As an elected Premier League representative Lowe must now relinquish his positions on various FA boards and committees as a result of Southampton's relegation. There will be other changes too. Graeme Le Saux quit football on Sunday night, with Jason Dodd and probably Jamie Redknapp set to join him when their contracts expire this summer. The manager Harry Redknapp is also considering his position. If, as expected, Lowe fails to persuade him to stay, he will have to search for the club's fourth manager in nine months."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
