Japanese fans have come together, as they do on the last Wednesday of every month to eat, drink and support rugby in Kamaishi, a tournament venue destroyed by the March 2011 tsunami disaster and, more recently, a victim of Typhoon Hagibis. Through the merry haze emitted by the dozens of drinkers seated among replica jerseys, scarves and player photographs, talk is turning to Saturday\u2019s final and which team, in the absence of the Brave Blossoms and the perennially popular All Blacks, are more deserving of local support. For a few days after Japan were beaten 26-3 by the Springboks in the quarter-finals, Japanese fans took to social media to share their sense of \u201crugby loss\u201d. There was more disappointment last weekend when the All Blacks, indisputably the most popular visiting team in the host nation, were demolished by England \u2013 the victors coached, of course, by Eddie Jones, the man who guided the Brave Blossoms to their most famous victory before this tournament. Counterintuitively, Japan\u2019s quarter-final defeat has ensured that local loyalties will be divided for Saturday\u2019s game. There is little appetite here for England to exact revenge against Japan\u2019s conquerors, and genuine affection for the Springboks and their travelling fans. For No Side regular Nobuhiko Otomo, South Africa represent far more than just a fearsome rugby team. \u201cI\u2019m going to support the Springboks,\u201d says Otomo, a 57-year-old writer and photographer. \u201cI\u2019m really taken with the whole Rainbow Nation story and with Siya Kolisi [the first black captain to lead the Springboks at a World Cup]. I was impressed when Michael Leitch spoke of his pride in leading a diverse Japanese team, and South Africa exemplifies those values.\u201d For all the mixed feelings he evokes elsewhere, Jones is revered in Japan as the man who masterminded the famous victory over South Africa at the last World Cup. \u201cEddie is a god \u2013 we all love him,\u201d says Hirosuke Mikasa. \u201cI honestly didn\u2019t think England were going to beat the All Blacks, but I forgot about Eddie\u2019s magic.\u201d But the 48-year-old won\u2019t be crying into his beer if the Springboks win on Saturday. \u201cJapan lost to South Africa in the quarter-final, so if they go on to win it says a lot about how much Japanese rugby has progressed.\u201d If Japan have become every neutral\u2019s second-favourite team, their fans\u2019 affections extend to all parts of the rugby world \u2013 to Canada, whose players rolled up their sleeves in the aftermath of Typhoon Hagibis, to southern hemisphere nations whose clubs the Sunwolves have encountered in Super Rugby, and to Six Nations countries where many Japanese have studied and worked. The idea of supporting any team other than the club and country one is saddled with by accident of birth may be anathema in other countries \u2013 particularly in football \u2013 but Japanese sports lovers have always been a more generous bunch. That much was clear from the results of a straw poll the Guardian conducted among members of \u201crugby family\u201d, a Japanese-language Facebook group. The result might come as a surprise to those who assume the Jones factor guarantees a comfortable majority in favour of England. Out of the 340 responses received 24 hours before kick-off \u2013 and with the usual caveats about acceptable margins of error \u2013 loyalties were split down the middle, with 170 supporting England and the same number backing the Springboks. Jones\u2019s previous role as Japan coach was a predictable factor among those plumping for England. Others cited his Japanese ancestry, while a lone voter had been swayed by her admiration for the royal family. But large numbers came out in favour of the Springboks, precisely because they had sent Japan out of the tournament. There were affectionate words, too, for Faf de Klerk, whom a Japanese sports tabloid described on Friday as the \u201cblond giant-killer\u201d. A surprising number \u2013 perhaps as much as a third of voters \u2013 said they would cheer on both teams. Junji Miura, a petroleum company executive whose 10-year-old daughter has just started playing rugby, subscribes to the rose-tinted view of the Jones legacy but will be putting his faith in the Australian\u2019s opposite number, Rassie Erasmus, on Saturday. \u201cJapan lost to South Africa in the quarter-final so if they go on and win, doesn\u2019t that mean Japan are No 2 in the world?\u201d Miura says, laughing at his understandable, if slightly skewed, logic. A good proportion of the No Side crowd, like those that have filled World Cup venues over the past six weeks, are women. \u201cI came a couple of times with friends about three years ago and the enthusiasm of all the rugby fans here rubbed off on me,\u201d says Yoko Adachi, a Tokyo resident whose interest in the sport inspired her to become a tournament volunteer. \u201cEngland\u2019s performance against the All Blacks was incredible and I suspect they\u2019ll win the final,\u201d Adachi adds. And then she pauses. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to support South Africa.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
