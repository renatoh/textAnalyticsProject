Gerrard is on holiday and not due to report back until June 27, but his agent Struan Marshall, of SFX, returns from honeymoon today and the Liverpool chief executive Rick Parry hopes to open talks over an extension to the 25-year-old's deal, on improved terms, as early as next week. The director of football at the Bernab\u00e9u, Arrigo Sacchi, has twice contacted Rafael Ben\u00edtez to inquire about the midfielder's availability in recent weeks. \"We're not going to put a timescale on talks,\" Parry said. \"But, like Steve, we would like the situation resolved sooner rather than later. We hope to be talking in the very near future.\" Liverpool moved one player on yesterday, selling El Hadji Diouf to Bolton for a fee that could amount to \u00a33m depending upon appearances and honours while the 24-year-old Senegalese, who cost \u00a310m from Lens three years ago, is at the Reebok. However, the chances of selling Milan Baros to G\u00e9rard Houllier at Lyon appear to be waning. Liverpool's participation in the qualifying stages of the Champions League has forced them, as expected, to cancel a pre-season visit to Japan, though the financial implications of missing out on the two-game tour have been limited because they intend to fulfil the commitment at a future date. That could see them travelling to Japan - where they were to play Shimizu S-Pulse and Kashima Antlers - next year. Blackburn's manager Mark Hughes still hopes to reach agreement with Porto to sign Benni McCarthy. The Lancashire club had an offer of about \u00a33.5m rejected this week and, though that virtually amounts to their transfer budget, Hughes believes compromise can be reached with the 2004 European champions. Porto value the striker at nearer \u00a36m. Rovers also hope to sign Shefki Kuqi, who is available on a free after choosing not to renew his contract at Ipswich. Preston's manager Billy Davies, an early candidate for vacancies at Hearts and Derby, has signed an open-ended rolling contract to remain at Deepdale, as has his assistant David Kelly. \"Both Ned [Kelly] and I were convinced that the time wasn't right for us to move on,\" the 41-year-old Davies said. George Burley and the former Parma coach Nevio Scala are Hearts' preferred candidates as they seek a head coach."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
