It\u2019s welcoming like country towns are supposed to be. You drive the Mitchell Highway from Bathurst, passing a go-kart track on the edge of town before you park on Summer Street \u2013 the main thoroughfare \u2013 and breathe in that fresh country air. You sit outside Scrumptious on Summer Cafe, where the waitresses seem know everyone by name and a sign in the window lets you know they serve the best breakfasts in Orange. As you eat the locally produced bacon and eggs, it\u2019s hard to deny that assertion. There\u2019s not a cloud in the sky and you sit there, with nothing to do all day but watch rugby and all you can say is: \u201cHow good is this?\u201d I\u2019m in Orange to watch the NSW Country Eagles play the table-topping Melbourne Rising in round five of the National Rugby Championship (NRC). An archetypal country town of around 40,000 people, Orange is 250km out of Sydney in central-western New South Wales. It\u2019s the type of place where tradies leave their tools unlocked in the trays of their utes and one lady I see doesn\u2019t even turn off the car before running into the cafe for a takeaway coffee. Think RM Williams boots, Rodd &amp; Gunn shirts and blokes in t-shirts and thongs on bitingly cold mornings. Then, just as the stereotype threatened to trip over itself, a man wearing a Yolo flat-peak hat and ugg boots walked down the street, as if to let you know they have bad taste in the country too. Halfway through its inaugural season, the NRC has been well-received in most rugby circles. Introduced to bridge the gap between club and Super Rugby, the competition\u2019s law variations \u2013 including reducing penalty goals from three points to two, increasing conversions from two to three and a couple of other alterations which speed up the game \u2013 mean the ball is in play for much longer and the nine teams involved are scoring plenty of tries. The pick of the competition through the first month is undoubtedly the Melbourne Rising, who have been downing teams all over the country. They\u2019ve scored a whopping 260 points in five games with the highlight being a 79-18 thrashing of Brisbane City in round three. Impressive stuff. The next highest scoring side are the second-placed Eagles, but they\u2019re 117 points behind on 143. The expectant buzz of an excited crowd increased as I walked the half a kilometre down Lords Place to Wade Park. They grow plenty of fruit around here but funnily enough it\u2019s too cold for oranges. Go figure. There\u2019s a burgeoning wine industry though and the locals put on a food and wine festival at the back of the grandstand. It took a fair bit of willpower not to duck into one of the marquees to sample the best local drop before kick-off, so I settled for an old-fashioned steak sandwich with onions and a Solo. The game itself was a scrappy affair, won 37-16 by the Rising in the toughest encounter they\u2019ve had to date. The Melbourne side\u2019s fifth consecutive bonus-point victory was dominated by forward play, punctuated by plenty of scrums and saw fewer tries than they\u2019re accustomed to scoring. Priding themselves on dominance up front, the Rising\u2019s fearsome pack fired an early warning shot with five consecutive scrum penalties before their red-headed halfback and captain Nic Stirzaker darted around a breakdown for the opening try of the match. The 10-minute passage preceding the try was a great example of how law variations influence a captain\u2019s thinking. Under the old rules, the lure of a penalty kick and a certain three points would have been the obvious choice, but Stirzaker repeatedly opted to pack another scrum. Even then, kicking for touch and trusting the lineout would have been easier, but this Melbourne side want to win the competition and taking the easy road isn\u2019t an option. The Rising immediately added to their tally with another try and three-point conversion before Eagles fly-half Sam Windsor sliced through the defensive line 10 metres out from the posts and narrowed the gap to 16-8. Windsor\u2019s skill deserted him just before halftime when he tripped over and missed a tackle to allow Melbourne flanker Sean McMahon an untouched run to the try-line and a 24-8 halftime lead. Melbourne back Telusa Veainu finished off a nice move on the left to open the second half and shortly afterwards, man-mountain Lopeti Timani capitalised on an attacking lineout to rampage past three defenders and put the result beyond doubt at 37-8. Timani, the former Waratah back-rower is big. As in \u201cShouldn\u2019t he have his own gravitational pull\u201d big. Maybe it\u2019s his size or the unmissable afro he\u2019s sporting at the moment, but I pegged him as one of the game\u2019s best and I was surprised when he told me afterwards that he\u2019d been sick all week and wasn\u2019t happy with his performance. Although the Eagles finished off with a try to impressive Randwick youngster Andrew \u201cThe Fire\u201d Kellaway \u2013 a winger \u2013 it\u2019s the Rising forwards who ruled the day. Timani and McMahon\u2019s cohorts up front, Cruze Ah-Nau, Pat Leafa, Paul Alo-Emile, Sam Jeffries, Cadeyrn Neville and Luke Jones all deserve a mention for laying a solid platform for the win. It\u2019s no wonder they\u2019re the odds-on favourites to take out the title. Although every Rising player I spoke to said it was the most physical match they\u2019ve played, NSW Country coach Darren Coleman was disappointed. The team\u2019s organised defensive systems were betrayed by a couple of moments of weakness and a few soft tries. The crowd filtered out of the grandstand and wandered over to the food and wine stalls where a live band played a Tracy Chapman cover. The Melbourne players belted out their victory song to the tune of Born in the USA while ARU CEO Bill Pulver pressed the flesh. I walked back up Lords Place and found the Hotel Canobolas where for a reasonable price they let you cook your own steak. The Bulldogs-Manly NRL final was about to kick off and with a beer in one hand and tongs in the other, I stood over the grill and said quietly: \u201cHow good is this?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
