I try not to read papers all the time, because they focus on the bad news. So I turn straight to the arts section. Magazines: Dazed and Confused, ID, Loop for arts, and Vice magazine for music. I love reading the articles in Dazed and Confused. They did a great issue on New York, which informed me about the city, even though I live here. I prefer British magazines - the sensibilities are more like mine. Books: At the moment I'm reading stuff for a feature I want to make with Jonathan Lethem - who's a bit surreal, really witty and plays with the future - and John Gilmore, who covers real, true crime. My favourite book, the one that sticks in my head is one called Alice. I don't know who the author was. I read it when I was about 15. It's about a teenage girl who's living on the streets. I lived vicariously through her. TV: I don't watch it at all. Ironic, considering I make videos and commercials. Radio: I really don't get an opportunity to listen to radio - I don't own one, and I don't own a car. The only radio I ever hear is in taxis. Adverts: I go back and forth between making music videos and commercials. The Flake ad I made was departing from what they normally do - she's a scientist, she's smart, she's in control. There was this billboard ad that completely shocked me, all down the side of a building, there were lots of footprints and it said Stamp Out Racism. They're using the message to sell running shoes! So I took out my marker and defaced it. New Media: I don't use it like some people do, though I have a website. I just use it for email. I did do one project with Bj\u00f6rk and MTV. It was a music video for the web - a webio. It was a really interesting project for me. It was kind of between photography and film. I really had to shift my head. \u00b7 Floria Sigismondi works in film, video, photography and sculpture.
