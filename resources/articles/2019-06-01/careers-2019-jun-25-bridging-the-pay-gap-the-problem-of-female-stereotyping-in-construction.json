But do women face even more hurdles when it comes to civil engineering and construction? \u201cFrom holding your own as the only woman in a room full of older men, to defying stereotypes and practicalities such as never having personal protective equipment (PPE) that fits, there are many hurdles faced by women in our industry,\u201d says Kate Watson, associate director, structural engineering at Patrick Parsons. Those hurdles start early, says associate structural and civil engineer Victoria Martin, with physics and maths often dominated by boys, and parents being less in favour of daughters studying engineering than sons. \u201cI can\u2019t help but notice that a large proportion of the female engineers I know (myself included) have been educated in a single-sex environment, free of the daily reminders that they are something of an anomaly,\u201d says Martin. For those who do make it into engineering, achieving a professional status carries a lot of weight, she adds. \u201cWomen who want to combine a family with a rewarding career, if they haven\u2019t achieved professional status prior to taking a break then this timeline can be further delayed. It meant a lot to me to get chartered and then promoted to associate before I had my first child, as I would then be returning with a level of credibility under my belt.\u201d A lack of parity when it comes to parental pay is another hurdle. \u201cFor a lot of families, the pattern of the woman as the main caregiver is established. This often comes at odds with the demands of the construction industry; operating at a high level is hard to balance with part-time or compressed hours.\u201d It\u2019s not impossible, though, she says, adding that if both women and men were asking for flexible working hours there might be more of a cultural shift in attitudes. For project engineer Daisy Partlow, the biggest problem is perception. \u201cPeople just don\u2019t know what to do with us,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are subconscious stereotypes \u2013 in the office, nine times out of 10 if someone is trying to find someone they\u2019ll walk past 10 other people and then come and ask me. That kind of thing puts people off.\u201d The sector recognises it has a lot of work to do \u2013 and has already started. Elizabeth Donnelly, CEO of the Women\u2019s Engineering Society (WES), says their efforts include MentorSET, a mentoring programme to support women engineers throughout their careers, as well as support for Stem Returners to help them return to engineering after a career break. It also founded International Women in Engineering Day (INWED), an annual global celebration of women engineers. The Institute of Coding (IoC) has created new flexible qualifications \u2013 designed to help women reskill \u2013 through its digital degree apprenticeship scheme. \u201cAll too often, stereotypes around courses, a notable gender pay gap and rigid working models mean that not enough female talent reaches the top, leading to a worrying lack of diversity,\u201d says director Rachid Hourizi. Elsewhere, training providers are teaming up with industry to encourage women into the sector. In the East Midlands, Access Training and Derby-based building firm Hodgkinson Builders recently expanded the Access Training Construction Academy to boost construction apprenticeships. Ian Hodgkinson, managing director at Hodgkinson Builders, says: \u201cThe Access Training Construction Academy will work to encourage all sorts of people to come in to the trade \u2013 not just men \u2013 to get the word out that the building industry is a great place to be, and to dispel the old thinking and perceptions that can unfortunately still be around.\u201d When it comes to encouraging women into the sector, Watson says: \u201cI believe the best thing I can do on a personal level is to do my job as well as I can, and be seen to be doing so. I believe it is my responsibility to call out inequalities I see and encourage and support other women in the workforce. I hope that in the future we will see a further shift for women in our industry, but it\u2019s certainly not a time to sit back \u2013 although we\u2019ve come far in recent years, there is still a lot to be done and it\u2019s a long game.\u201d Download our women in engineering supplement (pdf)"}, "isHosted": false}}}
