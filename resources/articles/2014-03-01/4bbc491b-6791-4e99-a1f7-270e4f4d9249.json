Goals from David Jones \u2013 against his former club \u2013 and Dean Marney pulled the Clarets five points clear in second place. \"I've looked at it over and over and it's a penalty. There's slight contact and Chris Martin has slipped because of the contact, his leg has been taken away. It wasn't a dive. We feel hard done by \u2013 but that's football.\" Sean Dyche said: \"It is fair to say that you'd be disappointed with the sending off but the boy Martin has been involved in five or six incidents before then and the ref has had to book him.\" Nottingham Forest 1-4 Wigan Uwe R\u00f6sler says his Wigan side must set their sights high after they climbed into the play-off places with an emphatic win over promotion rivals Forest at the City Ground. \"These teams above us are now in our sights. We should not be happy just to stay in the top six, we want to catch the guys in front of us. Automatic promotion is a little optimistic, but I am talking about the teams who are third, fourth or fifth.\" Forest manager Billy Davies insisted that automatic promotion was not beyond his side, despite Burnley opening up an 11-point advantage. \"That we are still in the top six with so many players out tells you how well the team has done so far this season. But there are still 13 games to go.\" And the rest Bolton ended Blackburn's five-match unbeaten run with an impressive 4-0 home win, moving nine points clear of the drop. \u25a0 Bournemouth demolished Doncaster 5-0 thanks to a Yann Kermorgant hat-trick and two from Harry Arter. \u25a0 Nahki Wells inspired Huddersfield to a 5-0 win over Barnsley, who drop to the bottom of the table. \u25a0 Ipswich moved to within four points of the play-offs by beating Birmingham 1-0 via a Daryl Murphy goal. \u25a0 Leicester remain on course for promotion after a comfortable 3-0 win over Charlton, with goals from Jamie Vardy, Danny Drinkwater and David Nugent. \u25a0 Millwall's troubles deepened with a 1-0 home defeat by Brighton via a controversial David L\u00f3pez penalty. \u25a0 A late Atdhe Nuhiu penalty gave Sheffield Wednesday a 1-0 win over 10-man Middlesbrough. \u25a0 And Watford extended Blackpool's 16-game winless run with a 4-0 thumping at Vicarage Road."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
