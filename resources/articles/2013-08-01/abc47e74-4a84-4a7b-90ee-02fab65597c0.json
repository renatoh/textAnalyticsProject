Now, in upstate New York, Rose's friend Adam Scott is doing his bit for Australia's heartfelt sporting pride \u2013 once again. It seems fitting that Rose has emerged as a serious threat here. He played his closing nine holes in 29 shots on Friday. Regardless of soft, inviting conditions usually representing a superb surface for scoring, Oak Hill remained a course laced with difficulty. Rose had started his second round by dropping two shots in two holes but launched a fierce recovery. His aggregate of six under is one worse than Scott with 36 holes to play. The pair are close. When Scott won the Masters this year, he sent a text message to Rose insisting \"this is our time\". Rose appeared to take the message literally by going out and winning the US Open at Merion in June. \"It is wonderful to be in this situation right now,\" Rose said. \"Talking about having done it, talking about feeling you can win more, believing in yourself and not talking like, 'I hope it can happen this week.' So I think that alone makes it easier. I also feel like my game is suited to tougher golf courses.\" Were Scott to win here, he would become the first player since 1975 to claim an Augusta Masters and US PGA victory in the same year. Then it was Jack Nicklaus who collected the first and fourth majors of the year. Rose's potential double, of the US Open and US PGA, was achieved more recently, by Tiger Woods 13 years ago. Scott cannot touch the great Nicklaus for golfing status but this is a player who looks certain to add to his solitary major win at some stage. He has a glorious swing, an equally impressive temperament and, in Steve Williams, a caddie who knows a thing or two about success on the big stage. \"I think the platform has never been better for me to win multiple majors,\" Scott said. The Australian has not matched Woods' winning streak this year, which currently sits at five, but he has proved himself arguably the most consistent competitor in the world. The only aberrations have come in the Open, two years in succession, with Scott stumbling when in a firm position to win both at Royal Lytham &amp; St Annes and, last month, at Muirfield. Scott's second round of 68 here was played in occasionally biblical rain which tested the draining at Oak Hill's East Course to the limit. Rose was afforded the same for nine holes. Another English player who had started day two in a prominent position, Lee Westwood, had cause to rue a late stumble. He shipped three shots in his last two holes before signing for a 73 that leaves him at one under. The 40-year-old later hinted he was not amused with the course conditions at Oak Hill. \"The 17th is playing really tough, unreachable,\" Westwood said. \"Tim Clark had to lay up on three par-fours today \u2013 17, 18 and 9. The ball was flying nowhere and it is playing really long. It is picking up mud as well. There were a lot of other things to contend with out there today.\" Rose's national back-up, for now, comes in the form of David Lynn. Scott's compatriot Jason Day, who is playing through a wrist problem, is supporting him at two under. Second-round heroics arrived from Jason Dufner. The American came within a tamely hit putt on the 18th of becoming the first player in history to shoot 62 in a major. Dufner had to make do with leading the field at nine under. It was the 26th score of 63 recorded in a major and came hours after Webb Simpson had equalled the previous course record of 64 set by Ben Hogan in 1942 and Curtis Strange in the 1989 US Open. Matt Kuchar, Simpson, Jim Furyk and Robert Garrigus continue to lurk, as do Steve Stricker and Henrik Stenson on what is a tightly packed leaderboard. Like Rose and Scott, Simpson must be taken seriously on the basis he knows how to win a major championship. The same applies to Martin Kaymer, who is four under alongside Simpson after two 68s. Friday's embarrassing episode arrived for Woody Austin. The Floridian, a former bank teller, failed to count the 15 clubs in his bag before reaching the 3rd hole. The outcome? A four-shot penalty. Angel Cabrera decided at the same juncture that he had seen quite enough of Oak Hill. The Argentinian hit his tee shot and was not seen again until later citing a wrist injury. \"El Pato\" (the Duck) did not take to this variety of water and waddled off."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
