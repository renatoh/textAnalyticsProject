Many things in life cannot be reduced to money \u2013 love and the wonders of nature being top of the list. However, his critique misses the point of what was radical and new about the National Ecosystem Assessment published last week. It is the first comprehensive inventory of the benefits humans derive from the environment for the UK. Many benefits are obvious \u2013 a park provides the opportunity to exercise and commune with nature, with the improvement in our health reducing costs to the NHS. But there are many hidden benefits as well, such as hedgerows that shelter the predators that eat the pests attacking our crops. For the first time, an attempt has been made to estimate what some of these benefits contribute in monetary terms, allowing them to be considered in contexts where previously their assumed value would have been zero. This provides us with an additional weapon in the fight to protect the countryside and to halt the degradation of habitats, biodiversity and all the benefits they provide. This stands alongside the belief that many aspects are indeed priceless. These moral and ethical arguments remain, but despite them we have failed to hit the 2010 target of halting biodiversity loss in the EU. New approaches are needed and the NEA provides a way forward. Monbiot describes the valuations as arbitrary, and it is true that the valuation methods could (and will) be improved in future years. But it is also true that they are more accurate than the previously assumed values of zero.
