The general, who retired as chief of the general staff in August, will chair the defence advisory board of the PA Consulting Group. He will also join Numis Securities, the investment banking and broking business, and Risk Advisory Group, which specialises in security matters. The government's advisory committee which vets the business appointments of newly retired senior public servants, have approved the appointments. Gen Jackson will join PA in February. The consultancy group has developed close relations with the Ministry of Defence, and has advised on its industrial strategy and the MoD's investments in information technology. Gen Jackson told the Guardian one of his main tasks will be to ensure that complex modern communications and surveillance networks now being developed for the MoD will be delivered in practice."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
