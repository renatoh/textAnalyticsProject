Alistair Darling also scrapped plans to raise the threshold for inheritance tax from \u00a3325,000 to \u00a3350,000, as he sought to put clear water between Labour and the Conservatives on the issue of the taxation of the wealthy. Currently, anyone buying a property for \u00a3175,000 or less avoids paying 1% stamp duty. This threshold has been in place since September 2008 when the chancellor increased it from \u00a3125,000. Since the stamp duty holiday was introduced, about 132,500 house-purchase mortgage transactions have escaped the tax, according to research by the Council of Mortgage Lenders. This accounts for more than a quarter of the 486,400 house purchase loans in the period. Estate agents and others involved in the property market had hoped the stamp duty holiday would be extended beyond its end date of 31 December. Nici Audhlam-Gardiner, director of mortgages at Abbey and Alliance &amp; Leicester, said: \"This is disappointing news not only for first-time buyers looking to take their first step on to the property ladder, but also for the wider housing market.\" Darling's move to freeze inheritance tax allowance had been anticipated by some commentators, who believe an attack on Tory plans in this area is likely to be central to Labour's general election fight. In 2007, ministers promised to raise the threshold progressively so that by April 2010 a single person could leave an estate of \u00a3350,000 and a couple \u00a3700,000 before their beneficiaries faced a tax bill. This was in response to the Tory proposal to raise it to \u00a31m, which gave the party's fortunes a major boost in 2007. Just 2.5% of estates were likely to pay inheritance tax in 2009-10, the Treasury said. In October it emerged there had been a dramatic fall in the number of families paying inheritance tax, partly as a result of falling house prices and stockmarket turmoil, with officials predicting that 12,000 households will pay death duty this year \u2013 the lowest since records began in the late 1930s. The tax is charged at 40% on all assets worth more than \u00a3325,000, though anything left to a spouse or civil partner is exempt. Nigel May, tax principal at accountancy firm MacIntyre Hudson, said: \"This move clearly serves nothing more than to continue Labour's strategy of drawing the electoral battleground on taxation of the wealthy. In terms of revenue, the measure will prove insignificant, but Labour will be privately delighted at how the tables have turned since George Osborne's speech at the Conservative party conference in 2007.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
