Seeing as the film is apparently awful and based on a comic, it's fair to say my expectations weren't high. And by and large I was right. Think Max Payne without the flair and you'd be on the right track. The one thing that did stand out was the violence, with the option to kill or spare your enemies after interrogation. Take the latter and you get a score, but do the former and you get to indulge in some serious claret spillage. Ways to dispatch the baddies include whacking their head on a fountain edge or feeding them into a mulch machine. A cutaway at the last minute spares gamers most of the gory details, but this is one game that revels in cartoon violence. Hopefully any Daily Mail journalists present realised this has an 18 certificate. Sadly the game itself looked uninspiring, with none of Max Payne's style."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
