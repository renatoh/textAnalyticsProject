The move, revealed in the Guardian yesterday, came as Jim Sheridan, the parliamentary private secretary at the Ministry of Defence, resigned in protest at government policy on the Middle East. Last night Mr Sheridan said: \"I think there is a significant amount of colleagues in the party, not just the usual suspects, but there are loyal members of the party and indeed the government ... who genuinely believe we cannot dictate Middle East policy by using excessive force. \"I think we are now in danger of embarking on an extremely dangerous strategy and we have to stop the bombing and killing of people on both sides of this conflict.\" The recall initiative was backed by almost all Liberal Democrat MPs, including party leader Sir Menzies Campbell. He said that if parliament had not been in recess, the prime minister would have been expected to make a statement on the crisis. Other supporters of the recall include SNP leader Alex Salmond and Plaid Cymru's Elfyn Llywd. Labour MPs backing the recall include John Denham, chairman of the home affairs select committee, Tony Lloyd, the former foreign office minister, Clare Short, former international development secretary, and, according to some sources, Paddy Tipping, parliamentary aide to the leader of the Commons Jack Straw. Another signatory was Ann Keen, the parliamentary private secretary to Gordon Brown. Mr Tipping could not be contacted last night. But the recall was opposed by the shadow foreign secretary, William Hague. The letter seeking a recall was sent to Mr Straw. It said: \"There is huge concern in the country about the current Middle East crisis, and fear that the early failure to insist that Israel and Hizbullah observe an immediate ceasefire has cost many innocent lives and may continue to do so. \"In addition, the use by US supply aircraft to refuel at Prestwick airport when transporting bombs and military hardware to be used by the Israel defence force in air-raids on densely populated civilian areas has given the impression that the UK has assumed a tacitly active ... role in the conflict.\" Mr Straw said two weeks ago that Israel's action had been disproportionate but has since been silent on the issue. The government has to recommend a recall to the Speaker. Opponents of a recall argue that Britain is not a central player in the conflict, unlike in Iraq, Bosnia and the Falklands, so MPs have little to contribute. Kim Howells, the minister responsible for the Middle East, said yesterday: \"I am sure people are very concerned about the situation in the Middle East, I certainly am, but I'm not sure what a recall of parliament would do to alter the situation.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
