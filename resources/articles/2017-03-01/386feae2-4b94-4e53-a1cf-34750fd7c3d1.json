Diego Cruz, 21, was one of four young men from prominent families in the coastal state of Veracruz who were nicknamed \u201cLos Porkys\u201d on social media after they were accused of seizing a classmate from their elite private school as she left a New Year\u2019s party on 1 January 2015. In a ruling which was made public on Monday, Judge Anuar Gonz\u00e1lez found that although Cruz was accused of touching the victim\u2019s breasts and penetrating her with his fingers, he had acted without \u201ccarnal intent\u201d \u2013 and so was not guilty of assault. Gonz\u00e1lez also found that although the victim, who was 17 at the time, was forced into the car of one of her alleged attackers, she was never \u201chelpless\u201d. Two of the other three suspects are accused of penetrating the victim. The release of Cruz \u2013 who had fled to Spain, but was extradited back to Mexico \u2013 has prompted outrage among human rights activists, and marked a new low point in a case that has reinforced the perception that those with money and political connections are above the law. \u201cHe sexually touched her, but because he didn\u2019t enjoy it, it\u2019s not sexual abuse?\u201d said Estefan\u00eda Vela Barba, an activist on gender issues. \u201cSince there was no pleasure in the act, it was intended to cause humiliation. They were touching her, they were bothering her, so for the judge, if the intention wasn\u2019t pleasure, it\u2019s not sexual assault,\u201d said Vela, who works in the legal studies department at the Centre for Teaching and Research in Economics. \u201cThere\u2019s no disputing the facts. It\u2019s not some crazy woman saying this, it\u2019s coming from the judge\u2019s mouth and he\u2019s saying that if they touch you against your will, it might not be abuse.\u201d The case of Los Porkys has provoked widespread indignation in Mexico, not least because it took place in the coastal state of Veracruz, which over recent months has come to symbolize the failure of the Mexican state to guarantee even a semblance of the rule of law. Amid an escalating battle between rival crime factions, thousands of women have gone missing in the state; earlier this month, more than 250 human skulls were discovered at what is believed to be a clandestine drug cartel burial ground. Meanwhile, the state\u2019s former governor Javier Duarte is on the run amid allegations that he stole vast amounts of public money. The case of Los Porkys has also been held up as an example of the rampant impunity allowed the offspring of Mexico\u2019s elite. Fifteen months after the attack, the victim described her ordeal in a public Facebook post, in an apparent attempt to shame authorities into taking action. \u201cI have nothing to repent,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI\u2019ve gone drinking. I\u2019ve gone to parties. I\u2019ve worn short skirts like many girls my age \u2026 and for that I\u2019m going to be judged? For that I deserved what happened?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
