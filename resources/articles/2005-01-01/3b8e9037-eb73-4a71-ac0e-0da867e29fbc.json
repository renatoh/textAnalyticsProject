Steve McClaren wants a temporary replacement for the injured George Boateng and Boro may be able to get the 30-year-old Dacourt, now at Roma, on loan for the rest of the season. Roma, who are in debt, have to offload players this month and Dacourt has long been touted as one of those who could be sold or loaned out to reduce their wages bill. The France midfielder has not played for Roma since October due to injury but is believed to be approaching full fitness and would be a neat fit for Boateng, who has a broken toe. McClaren also feels Boro need reinforcing if they are to capitalise on a good first half of the season. On Tuesday Dacourt's agent, Giorgi de Giorgis, had speculated that the player was on his way back to England, but yesterday De Giorgis was attempting to retract that impression. \"I never said Olivier could leave Roma during the January transfer window,\" De Giorgis said. \"Dacourt likes to stay at Roma and has no intention to move to other clubs. \"Then we will see in June if it's the case to make a move. He gets along with [manager] Del Neri, and when he is physically fit, he will return to action.\" But Middlesbrough's interest is known. Much depends on the attitude of Geremi at Chelsea, and whether he wants a return to Teesside. McClaren tried to bring in Geremi again at the start of this season and contact has remained in place. Middlesbrough are also understood to have asked to be kept informed of Steed Malbranque's position at Fulham. At Newcastle Sammy Kuffour's agent Fabio Parisi has held talks with the United chairman Freddy Shepherd. The Bayern Munich defender is still a Newcastle target and will continue to be until Newcastle know definitively if Sylvain Distin is staying at Manchester City. Newcastle have made a \u00a35m bid for Distin and appear to have taken little notice of City's protestations last Friday that Distin will not be leaving. John Gregory, the former Aston Villa and Derby County manager, has been appointed as international scout by the Brazilian club, Corinthians. One of his principal tasks appears to be to help Corinthians sell players to Europe. \"This scout is going to be a great help for us because he knows a lot about European football and he can link us to many teams to show our players,\" said the Corinthians president Andres Sanchez."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
