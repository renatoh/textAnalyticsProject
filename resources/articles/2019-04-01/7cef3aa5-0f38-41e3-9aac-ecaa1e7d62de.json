Walsh has sometimes managed to miss the National by getting injured in an earlier race but there is no chance of such a mishap this time, as the 9-1 shot is his only mount of the day. Trained by Willie Mullins, Rathvinden looked all over a National contender when cruising through the four-miler at last year\u2019s Cheltenham Festival. It was particularly impressive that he responded so gamely when challenged by a talented rival close home. His prep run could not have gone better at Fairyhouse in February, in a race Mullins used to prepare his previous National winner, Hedgehunter. The signs are that he will be well backed and may even end up challenging Tiger Roll at the top of the market. Tiger Roll\u2019s list of achievements is extraordinary and it is easy to imagine him becoming the first dual winner since Red Rum. But he has more weight to carry and, as a small horse, will need another charmed run through. Not all National winners are delighted to find themselves back here a year later and the available 4-1 is surely too short. Joe Farrell, last year\u2019s Scottish National winner, is dangerous after sneaking in at the foot of the weights. His recent run at Newbury, giving lumps of weight to the winner, was a personal best. Ballyoptic, narrowly behind him at Ayr, is an interesting contender at each-way odds, though his jumping is a potential weak spot. Tea For Two could give Lizzie Kelly a great spin and reach the places at huge odds, having dropped to a very attractive rating. This is the horse that beat Cue Card in a Grade One here two years ago and he was moving well through the Festival\u2019s cross-country race until unseating, suggesting the ability is still there. Walk In The Mill is a tricky customer but took to this place well in December and can get involved. Jury Duty seems a short price for a horse with stamina questions to answer. Anibale Fly has earned top weight by getting placed in the last two Gold Cups but no horse has shouldered as much to victory here since Red Rum in 1974 and his latest Cheltenham effort was only three weeks ago. 2.25 Angel\u2019s Breath and Brewin\u2019upastorm were fancied for Cheltenham Festival races and will still have their admirers, despite missing the places there. But Umbrigado will be fresher for having missed that week and looks a promising young horse on the upgrade for David Pipe. 3.00 Lalor was so disappointing at Cheltenham that it is hard to show faith here, for all that Aintree has brought the best out in him in previous years. Ornua was an early faller in the Arkle but, provided he can stay on his feet this time, Henry de Bromhead\u2019s runner can lead them a merry dance. 3.40 When flopping in the Champion Hurdle Apple\u2019s Jade was not well but the result is that she looks like starting around 2-1, a bigger SP than she has been for two years. She is the best horse in this line-up and the memory is still green of her 41-length success the last time she showed up here, in 2016. 4.20 Having come good in the spring last year, Clondaw Westie looked good again in scoring at Stratford recently, giving the impression he was keeping quite a bit back. He could go well at a big price."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
