One in every 100 children of secondary school age has CFS, also known as ME, and it can wreck their lives. Those affected miss a year of school on average, many of them getting to classes on just two days a week. Half are bedbound at some stage. Esther Crawley, a paediatrician and professor of child health at Bristol University, runs the biggest centre for children with CFS in the country, seeing about 400 patients a year. She embarked on a trial of the commercial Lightning Process because the children she cares for and their parents were interested in it. \u201cEvery single week in my clinic, children came up to me and said we want to know about the Lightning Process. People have told us to try it. Should we have it?\u201d she said. \u201cIt was fascinating at the time. We heard about people getting better and people getting worse. I was kind of curious. I never expected that it would work.\u201d If anything, said Crawley, she set up the trial in a way that would make it harder for it to be shown to work. The Lightning Process is a commercial programme, developed from osteopathy, life coaching and neuro-linguistic programming. It has been endorsed by celebrities like Martine McCutcheon and Esther Rantzen, who credits it for her daughter\u2019s recovery from ME. The course costs around \u00a3620. It is billed as training rather than therapy and lasts three intensive days. The trial was relatively small \u2013 100 young people aged 12 to 18 took part, half of whom had the usual treatment that Crawley\u2019s team at Bristol\u2019s Royal United Hospital give patients, while the other half had that plus the Lightning Process training as well. Results published in the journal Archives of Disease in Childhood show that children who went through the Lightning Process programme were doing better than the others at six months and had improved still more by 12 months. Physical function, fatigue, anxiety and depression all improved more in the Lightning Process group. Those with the usual treatment \u2013 which includes improving sleep, exercise management and sometimes cognitive behaviour therapy \u2013 were spending more time in school at the end of a year, up to three days a week. Those who had the Lightning Process as well were in school four days a week. \u201cThere are a lot of limitations,\u201d said Crawley. \u201cThe main thing is to be absolutely clear to families that we don\u2019t know if the Lightning Process works on its own. I\u2019m not advocating people go out and get the Lightning Process. And we don\u2019t know if it works for adults and we don\u2019t know if it works for primary school-age children.\u201d The nature of the course put off many children from taking part in the trial. It involves three intensive days in a group of other CFS sufferers, which is hard for patients to contemplate. But, Crawley said, \u201cThis is a good news story.\u201d More studies are needed before it can be considered by the NHS, but it offered real possibility for some children. The Lightning Process was developed by osteopath Phil Parker in the late 1990s and is offered for a range of conditions. Its use in CFS has been controversial among those highly vocal activists who resist any attempt to suggest the disease is psychological rather than physical. Parker claims that the Lightning Process works by teaching people to use their brain to \u201cstimulate health-promoting neural pathways\u201d. Those who have been through it say they are taught that negative thoughts and emotions can affect their body\u2019s health. In the only other study done on the process, an analysis of the experiences of a handful of young people from the Harvard School of Public Health, one described using a physical gesture to stop the negativity of the mind. \u201cWhenever you get a negative thought, emotional symptom, you are supposed to turn on one side and with your arm movements in a kind if stop motion, just say STOP very firmly and that is supposed to cut off the adrenaline response,\u201d the young patient said. Crawley says CFS is caused by a biological response, usually to a viral trigger. Children can be genetically susceptible and do not recover fully after an infection. \u201cCFS is really common and uses up vast amounts of NHS resources,\u201d she says. But a minority of activists and campaigners who feel CFS is being categorised as a psychological illness are deterring scientists from research and doctors from going into the field to treat people who desperately want to get better. Crawley was attacked for launching the latest trial, as she has been in the past. \u201cAt medical school people are told not to go into [CFS]. As researchers they are told not to go into it because you get so much abuse,\u201d she said. \u201cWe still have a condition which is really common and really disabling and children begging for treatment and begging for answers, but people won\u2019t go into it. \u201cWhen I think about leaving, which I do a lot, I think about the children who come to my clinics who have miserable lives because current treatment is not effective enough. We have to do research.\u201d The ME Association said it had \u201cspoken out robustly\u201d about the trial since it first heard about it in 2010. It said it believed such a trial in children was unethical. \u201cThe Lightning Process is not a treatment that we endorse or recommend for people with ME/CFS,\u201d said its medical adviser, Dr Charles Shepherd. \u201cPatient evidence, gathered from our members over many years, indicates that some people who have gone through the Lightning Process believe that they are able to quickly increase their physical and mental activity levels. However, this is can be followed by a relapse or significant worsening of symptoms. \u201cOthers who have gone through the Lightning Process treatment report that they have spent huge amounts of money with no obvious benefit.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
