Less than 48 hours after beating the Olympic champion, world champion and world record holder in Oslo, Chambers did it again in the Don Valley Stadium. This time his main challenge came not from the American but the teenager Mark Lewis-Francis. Both ran under 10 seconds - the first time two Britons have achieved that in the same race. The fact that their 9.95sec and 9.97 respectively will not count for record purposes because the following wind of 2.7 metres a second was above the limit did not detract from the achievement. The message this performance will send round the world is that the future has arrived. Britain's crop of fine youngsters have for a number of years been tipped to reach the top of world sprinting. Now they are fulfilling that prediction. Behind Chambers and Lewis-Francis was Jason Gardener in third as Greene, whose world record is 9.79, slumped to sixth, his worst performance since 1996. Yesterday he could manage only 10.24. \"There's a new sheriff in town and it feels good to whup an American again,\" said Chambers. \"Maurice won't like being beaten by a Brit. He's tired and will be back but I'll be waiting for him.\" The emergence of the 24-year-old Londoner from the chorus line to leading role is reminiscent of 1992 when Linford Christie discovered his self-belief and began regularly beating the top Americans on his way to claiming the Olympic title. \"Dwain has the belief now that the Americans can't come over and smack him,\" said John Regis, the former Euro pean 200m champion who is now Chambers' agent. \"He had the talent before but never thought he could put it altogether. He looks the part now.\" That confidence has percolated through to the 19-year-old Lewis-Francis. He has bridged the gap between the junior and senior ranks seamlessly and he believes it is Chambers he must focus on now, rather than Greene. \"I reckon he's had his time and it's our turn now,\" said the Birchfield runner. \"We've got more fire in our bellies and want it more than the Americans.\" It was a typical summer's day in Sheffield - cold, wet and windy - but that alone did not explain Greene's performance. He clearly tanked it in the closing stages when he realised he was not going to win but from the first stride he was behind the Britons. Afterwards he could be heard expressing his frustration in graphic terms to his training partner Ato Boldon, the Olympic silver medallist who finished seventh as his crisis of form showed no sign of ending. \"These first couple of meetings I have not prepared myself well for,\" said Greene, the world No1 since 1997. \"Dwain has run another great race. The true story is I'm healthy, I feel great now but I'm a little tired from travelling. The old Maurice Greene will be back.\" Hostilities were due to be renewed in Lausanne tomorrow but both Greene and Chambers are set to bypass that meeting. They could meet again in Paris on Friday, but Chambers may also pull out of that meeting to concentrate on his preparations for this month's Commonwealth Games. Chambers may need treatment anyway on a shoulder injury which was heavily strapped up as he finished second in the 200m to Frankie Fredericks, the Namibian clocking 20.29 to his 20.38. \"It's not major, it just irritates,\" he said. \"This year I'm concentrating on the championships; everything else can take a back seat.\" Greene was not the only giant to be slain. In the triple jump Jonathan Edwards was beaten by a Briton for the first time since 1997 as he finished second to Phillips Idowu. The 23-year-old red-haired Enfield jumper lit up the arena as he leapt 17.34 metres, 28 centimetres further than the Olympic champion and world record holder. \"I was ready for this and it wasn't a flash in the pan,\" he said. Perhaps Edwards could be forgiven for a below-par performance. He admits that at the age of 36 it takes longer to recover from competitions than it used to and jumping 17.51m in Oslo had clearly taken it out of him. \"I felt tired and wasn't up to the challenge,\" he admitted. \"There's nothing to worry about.\" There was even a world best from a Yorkshireman for the crowd to celebrate at the first major meeting to be held here since 1998. It came from Rotherham's Chris Rawlinson, who ran 34.48 in the 300m hurdles, taking 0.11 off his own two-year-old record."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
