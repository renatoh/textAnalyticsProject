It is, \"the unemployed and inactive community\". I've just read an unbearably tedious report from the Institute for Employment Studies, whatever that may be, in which this phrase crops up regularly, among the hand-wringing pronouncements on retraining the over-50s for the \"jobs market\". How do I feel about being part of an official \"community\"? My first thoughts were that this might be a good thing. Like the \"gay community\", us idlers might be able to claim equal rights. We can go on marches, or sit-ins, and proclaim our right to be lazy. We can accuse government interferers and bosses of anti-idler prejudice. Maybe there will be access to special grants to attend \"Inactive Community Centres\", formerly known as pubs? However, on further reflection, this euphemism seems actually to cloak a crackdown on idleness. Use of the word \"community\" pretends to dignify a disparate group of people but, in fact, conceals a moral superiority and value judgement on the part of the person who uses it. It is demeaning and it is perfectly obvious that they really mean \"lazy spongers\". For example, I could very easily reverse things and call the authors of this report members of the \"over-zealous work-addicted community\". Back in 1938 there was a similar move to get people back into work. Rather than \"the unemployed and inactive community\" they were then called \"work-shy elements\". The definition, as given by a report at the time, read: \"Men who are old enough to work and who have recently been certified fit by an official doctor or who will be certified and who can be proved to have rejected offers of work on two occasions without just cause or have accepted work only to abandon it again shortly afterwards without adequate reason\". Once the unemployed and inactive community members had been discovered, the solution was to send them for retraining. The country? Germany. The author of the report? SS chief Heinrich Himmler. The name of the retraining centre? Concentration camp Buchenwald, near Weimar. The names change and so do the methods, but the fundamental problem is the same: governments hate idlers. Truly, you've got to fight for your right to be lazy. \u00b7 Tom Hodgkinson is editor of the Idler and author of How To Be Idle (Penguin, \u00a37.99)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
