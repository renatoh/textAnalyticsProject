The episode The Last Crusade has already screened in Europe but will be broadcast on Saturday on Discovery Family. While the characters are new to the animated series, they have appeared in the books, whose writer, Michael Vogel, has quashed any suggestion that they may in fact be sisters. \u201cWhat a cute couple!\u201d he tweeted in 2017, when someone shared an image of the pair. When another Twitter user asked if they were lesbians in the book, he replied: \u201cWell, they aren\u2019t sisters sooo \u2026 \u201d Asked to clarify for a final time, Vogel doubled down. Vogel tweeted again on Wednesday, celebrating the timing of the US broadcast. \u201cDoin\u2019 what we can to bring more EQuality to EQuestria!! #PrideMonth,\u201d he said. Vogel, who is gay, told BuzzFeed that the idea was a collaboration between him and the showrunners, Nicole Dubuc and Josh Haber. \u201cNicole and I thought this was a great opportunity to organically introduce an LGBTQ couple in the series, and we asked Hasbro and they approved it,\u201d he said. \u201cMy Little Pony has always been about friendship and accepting people (or ponies) that are different from you. So it just felt like something important to do.\u201d While the news has been roundly celebrated on social media and beyond, it hasn\u2019t taken long for opposing voices to weigh in. On Twitter, Australian conservative commentator Lyle Shelton \u2013 the former managing director of the Australian Christian Lobby who unsuccessfully led the country\u2019s campaign against marriage equality last year \u2013 has taken a strong stance against the sweet and tiny gay cartoon ponies. \u201cIt\u2019s a brave new world folks &amp; we need to push back while we can,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cSitting outside politics is no longer an option for conservatives.\u201d The news comes a month after the children\u2019s show Arthur featured a same-sex wedding, when Arthur\u2019s third-grade teacher, Mr Ratburn, married his boyfriend, an aardvark and chocolatier named Patrick. Alabama Public Television refused to screen the episode, with the network\u2019s managing director calling it a \u201cviolation of trust\u201d. The episode of My Little Pony will air on Discovery Family in the US on Saturday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
