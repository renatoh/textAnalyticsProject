Amid reports in publications such as the Times that the online retail giant was turning away book deliveries to focus on household essentials and medical supplies, Amazon told the Guardian on Friday that it is still accepting new stock from publishers. However, with several major publishers moving some scheduled releases to later in the year, confusion reigns among readers about which books will be available during the lockdown. Increased demand for postal services has led to delays in delivery, with Waterstones \u2013 which closed all its stores on 23 March \u2013 announcing that online orders would face \u201cslight delays\u201d. On Monday and Tuesday respectively, wholesalers Gardners and Bertrams announced they were temporarily suspending all orders, making it more difficult for bookshops, particularly independents, to get fresh stock until restrictions lift. While publishers are continuing to supply large booksellers such as Amazon, Waterstones and supermarkets, independents are generally supplied by the wholesalers because of their small orders, meaning they now have only existing stock. Late on Thursday, Gardners reopened, allowing bookshops to order single copies of books for customers \u2013 but only for titles it has in stock. \u201cAt this stage we have a very limited offer and have not opened our business up in anywhere near the capacity it was. In fact much of it is very much closed,\u201d said Gardners\u2019s Nigel Wyman. \u201cWith a cut-down service and a very small number of staff we can maintain a safe working environment that adheres to the current government guidelines regarding social distancing.\u201d Although Nielsen BookScan, the UK\u2019s official book sales monitor, says that sales were up 6% in the week to Saturday 21 March, they are believed to have since fallen as shops closed. Official data is no longer available from Nielsen, for the first time in its 22-year history, \u201cdue to the unprecedented temporary closure of bookshops in the UK\u201d, it said on Tuesday. Publishers are pushing back their big new titles, such as Raynor Winn\u2019s follow-up to The Salt Path and Ruth Jones\u2019s second novel, to the autumn and even to 2021. This is an attempt to prevent them getting lost in a world without bookshops. A senior staff member of one of the major publishers told the Guardian that their sales were currently at 20% of normal levels. Many indie booksellers, who had been getting inventive in order to deliver books on bikes and even skateboards, have begun to warn customers they will no longer be able to fulfil orders. At Warwick Books, owners Mog and Pauline Harris announced that the wholesalers\u2019 closure made things extremely difficult. \u201cWe are really sad to even think we have to do this, but as a small independent we have to think long-term and no books to sell is a tricky pickle for a bookshop,\u201d they wrote. Gardners\u2019s change of heart was \u201cgood, but most orders we have received are for multiple books so it isn\u2019t very practical\u201d, they added on Friday. While publishers are responding well to direct orders, \u201clike us their systems aren\u2019t set up for small single-line orders so I imagine it won\u2019t be sustainable\u201d. Louise Ashmore at Read bookshop in Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, said the closure of wholesalers was a blow, but that Gardners\u2019s offer was a \u201chuge help\u201d, and \u201cwe\u2019ve been up until the early hours of the morning processing orders while we can\u201d. The store, which opened last year, is now hoping to buy books directly from publishers, to sell in a \u201cwhen it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s gone\u201d type of promotion. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure if it will work but we feel that while we can still get to a postbox, we should still try,\u201d Ashmore said. Edinburgh\u2019s Portobello Bookshop has closed both its physical and online shop, despite Gardners\u2019s offer. \u201cUnfortunately under the new system the postage and admin costs are so high that it\u2019s not going to be affordable for us to bring staff out of furlough without passing those costs on to customers, which isn\u2019t something we\u2019d be comfortable doing,\u201d said bookseller Jack Clark. Emma Corfield-Walters at Bookish in Crickhowell in Powys, south Wales, said it had been a \u201chell of a week\u201d but welcomed the change at Gardners. \u201c[It] is also testament to Gardners\u2019s support to indies at this tough time; they could have just shut up shop but are constantly looking at how to work safely and still help us out when we need it most,\u201d she said. Indies are still doing their best to be inventive despite impact on their supply. The Barrister in Wonderland in Retford, Nottinghamshire has launched a PayItForward scheme, where customers can buy a book for those in their community who would benefit from one in the future, while at The Book Shop in Lee-on-the-Solent, owner Sarah Veal has come up with the idea of \u201cPositivity Boxes\u201d. At \u00a310 each, they contain \u201ca good book, choccy treat, a hot chocolate sachet, a bookmark and a card from the sender\u201d. More than 80 have been purchased and sent out in the last two weeks to people self-isolating, \u201cjust to let them know that they are being thought of\u201d, said Veal. \u201cThere is no better moment than now to have a bookseller in your life and sign up for a subscription,\u201d urged Nicky Dunne at Mayfair bookseller Heywood Hill. \u201cTwo mottoes, too: \u2018carpe librum\u2019 and \u2018chins up\u2019.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
