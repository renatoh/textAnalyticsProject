Arsenal are hunting for a full-time manager after dismissing Unai Emery last week and Rodgers is prominent in their thinking. But it would be difficult for them to persuade him to come after he declared on Sunday, when asked whether he was committed to staying at the club he has led to second in the Premier League since joining from Celtic in February: \u201cYes, very much so. I left a club eight and a half months ago and that was a change I made to come to a club with ambition. It is a huge challenge here to break into the top six. I\u2019ve loved every minute since I\u2019ve come here. We\u2019ve got work to do but I\u2019m excited. \u201cMy focus is very much here with Leicester. The club has been first class with me. The project feels very exciting with a lot of development ahead. So my concentration is very much with Leicester.\u201d Rodgers suggested the contractual clause that enables him to leave under certain conditions is a common arrangement. \u201cThey\u2019re probably in most managers\u2019 contracts,\u201d he said after Leicester\u2019s late 2-1 home victory over Everton. \u201cI\u2019ve been so happy to work with the players and I feel we still have a lot of work to do. Most managers\u2019 contracts will have something in that but for me my only concentration is on Leicester.\u201d Rodgers said he was not bothered by suggestions that Arsenal could try to lure him away. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t annoy me. I don\u2019t think so much about it. It\u2019s not in my control. I came here to help the project and see if we could bring it forward. I\u2019m at a great club. I absolutely love it here. It seems now you\u2019re talking about managers losing their jobs all the time and looking to be replaced. Names will get thrown right, left and centre. For the Arsenal job there are probably about 10 names. Me, I\u2019m just concentrating on Leicester.\u201d Rodgers\u2019 work at Leicester has attracted plenty of admirers. On Sunday his team moved to within eight points of the league leaders Liverpool by winning a sixth league match in a row. Kelechi Iheanacho\u2019s scored in stoppage time to secure a 2-1 victory over Everton, who had taken the lead in the first half. Rodgers is not entertaining any title talk just yet. But nor is he ruling it out. \u201cWe\u2019ve made a very very good start. We want to continue with that. I\u2019ll see where we are at with 10 games to go. Then we\u2019ll have a good idea of where we\u2019ll finish.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
