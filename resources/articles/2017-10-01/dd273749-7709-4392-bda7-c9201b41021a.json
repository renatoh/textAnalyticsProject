Jordi Turull, the Catalan regional government spokesman, told reporters early on Monday morning that 90% of the 2.26 million Catalans who voted Sunday chose yes. He said nearly 8% of voters rejected independence and the rest of the ballots were blank or void. He said 15,000 votes were still being counted.The region has 5.3 million registered voters. Turull said the number of ballots did not include those confiscated by Spanish police during violent raids which resulted in hundreds of people being injured. At least 844 people and 33 police were reported to have been hurt, including at least two people who were thought to have been seriously injured. Catalonia\u2019s regional leader, Carles Puigdemont, spoke out against the violence with a pointed address: \u201cOn this day of hope and suffering, Catalonia\u2019s citizens have earned the right to have an independent state in the form of a republic. \u201cMy government, in the next few days, will send the results of [the] vote to the Catalan parliament, where the sovereignty of our people lies, so that it can act in accordance with the law of the referendum.\u201d Puigdemont had pressed ahead with the referendum despite opposition from the Spanish state, which declared the poll to be illegal, and the region\u2019s own high court. He told crowds earlier in the day that the \u201cpolice brutality will shame the Spanish state for ever\u201d. The Spanish government defended its response after hundreds of people were hurt when riot police stormed polling stations in a last-minute effort to stop the vote on Sunday. Although many Catalans managed to cast their ballots, others were forcibly stopped from voting as schools housing ballot boxes were raided by police acting on the orders of the Catalan high court. The large Ramon Llull school in central Barcelona was the scene of a sustained operation, with witnesses describing police using axes to smash the doors, charging the crowds and firing rubber bullets. Spain\u2019s interior ministry said 12 police officers had been hurt and three people arrested for disobedience and assaulting officers. The Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, speaking on Sunday night, said the government had done what it had had to do and thanked the police for acting with \u201cfirmness and serenity\u201d. \u201cToday there has not been a self-determination referendum in Catalonia. The rule of law remains in force with all its strength. We are the government of Spain and I am the head of the government of Spain and I accepted my responsibility. \u201cWe have done what was required of us. We have acted, as I have said from the beginning, according to the law and only according to the law. And we have shown that our democratic state has the resources to defend itself from an attack as serious as the one that was perpetrated with this illegal referendum. Today, democracy has prevailed because we have obeyed the constitution.\u201d Ada Colau, the mayor of Barcelona, demanded an end to the police actions and called for the Rajoy\u2019s resignation. Artur Mas, the former Catalan president whose government staged a symbolic independence referendum three years ago, called for the \u201cauthoritarian\u201d Rajoy to stand down, adding that Catalonia could not remain alongside \u201ca state that uses batons and police brutality\u201d. Enric Millo, the most senior Spanish government official in the region, said the police had behaved \u201cprofessionally\u201d in carrying out a judge\u2019s orders. Soraya S\u00e1enz de Santamar\u00eda, the Spanish deputy prime minister, echoed that position, saying the police had shown firmness, professionalism and proportionality in the face of the \u201cabsolute irresponsibility\u201d of the Catalan government. She called on Puigdemont to drop the \u201cfarce\u201d of the independence campaign, saying Spain had long since emerged from the authoritarian shadow of the Franco dictatorship. \u201cI don\u2019t know what world Puigdemont lives in, but Spanish democracy does not work like this,\u201d said S\u00e1enz de Santamar\u00eda. \u201cWe have been free from a dictatorship for a long time and of a man who told us his word in the law.\u201d The Catalan government\u2019s spokesperson Jordi Turull said 319 of the 2,315 polling stations set up for the referendum were closed by police. Jes\u00fas L\u00f3pez Rodr\u00edguez, a 51-year-old administrator, had taken his family to vote at the Ramon Llull school in the morning. Like thousands of Catalans, they began queuing from 5am. Three and a half hours later, national police officers arrived in riot gear. \u201cThey told us that the Catalan high court had ordered them to take the ballot boxes and that we needed to disperse,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cWe chanted, \u2018No! No! No!\u2019, and then about 20 police officers charged us. It was short \u2013 only about two minutes \u2013 but we stayed together.\u201d After about 15 minutes, eight or nine more police vans appeared and officers began cordoning off the surrounding streets and arresting people, L\u00f3pez Rodr\u00edgue said. \u201cThey dragged them out violently. We stood our ground but they kept dragging people away, kicking them and throwing them to the ground.\u201d More police arrived and jumped over the school fence to enter the building to look for ballot boxes. After using axes to break down the doors of the school, they emerged with the boxes. L\u00f3pez Rodr\u00edguez said that at about 10.25am, police began shooting rubber bullets \u2013 \u201cat least 30 or 40\u201d. He fled the shots with his wife and children, returning to their flat opposite the school. \u201cI feel really angry about it,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I also hope people in Europe and around the world will see what\u2019s happening in Catalonia.\u201d Similar scenes were reported elsewhere. Riot police smashed the glass doors of the sports centre near Girona where Puigdemont had been due to vote. Despite forcing their way in, they failed to stop the Catalan president voting. Pictures showed him casting his ballot in nearby Cornella del Terri. The day started peacefully and hopefully in polling stations across the region. Hundreds of people started queuing outside the Cervantes primary school in central Barcelona from well before dawn. \u201cI\u2019m here to fight for our rights and our language and for our right to live better and to have a future,\u201d said Mireia Estape, who lives close to the school. One man in the queue, who did not wish to be named, said he had come because \u201cCatalans need to vote; they\u2019re robbing us in Spain\u201d. Another would-be voter said simply: \u201cI don\u2019t want to live in a fascist country.\u201d Many Catalans saw their wishes fulfilled in polling stations as officers from the regional force, the Mossos d\u2019Esquadra, hung back. Joaqu\u00edn Pons, 89, was delighted to have cast his ballot, as he had done in the symbolic referendum three years ago. \u201cLast time it was cardboard ballot boxes,\u201d he said. \u201cThis time they were real. It was very emotional.\u201d Pons said he felt Catalans had had little choice but to proceed unilaterally. \u201cIt would have been nice if we could all have stayed together in Spain but the Madrid government has made it impossible. It\u2019s sad but that\u2019s the way it is.\u201d News and images of the police operation travelled quickly through the crowds in Barcelona and elsewhere, adding to the uneasy atmosphere that has intensified since police arrested 14 Catalan officials and seized millions of ballot papers last week. On Sunday afternoon, FC Barcelona announced that its Spanish league game against Las Palmas would be played without fans at the city\u2019s Nou Camp stadium. In a statement, the club condemned the attempts to prevent Catalans \u201cexercising their democratic rights to free expression\u201d and said the professional football league had refused to postpone the game. Sunday\u2019s violence came less than 24 hours after the Spanish government had appeared confident that enough had been done to thwart the vote. On Saturday, Millo said police had sealed off 1,300 of the region\u2019s 2,315 polling stations, while Guardia Civil officers acting on a judge\u2019s orders had searched the headquarters of the Catalan technology and communications centre, disabling the software connecting polling stations and shutting down online voting applications. \u201cThese last-minute operations have allowed us to very definitively break up any possibility of the Catalan government delivering what it promised: a binding, effective referendum with legal guarantees,\u201d he said.
