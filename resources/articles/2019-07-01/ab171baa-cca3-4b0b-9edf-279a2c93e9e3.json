The plans, revealed to the Observer by shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer, underline the extent of opposition the probable next prime minister will face from across the House of Commons if he fails to negotiate a new Brexit deal that can pass through parliament by late autumn. Johnson, firm favourite to win the Tory leadership contest on Tuesday and enter No 10 the following day, has promised to deliver Brexit on 31 October come what may, which means he will be prepared to leave without a deal if necessary. But after MPs last week voted by a majority of 41 to make it more difficult for a new prime minister to force through no deal by shutting down parliament, further cross-party plans are being made to block that option. Starmer will approach Hammond and others, including the justice secretary, David Gauke, for talks on how to prevent no deal this week. Writing in today\u2019s Observer, Starmer says parliament must be put on a \u201cwar footing\u201d to prevent a no-deal outcome, with party allegiances put aside in the national interest. \u201cOn Tuesday morning some ministers will sit around the cabinet table for the last time,\u201d Starmer says. \u201cThey know very well the dangers of no deal. They will have been briefed about what it would mean for jobs, the economy, our public services and the union. They will have seen the advice and read the evidence. \u201cAfter they have resigned this week, I will want to work with all those former ministers who, like me, want to ensure parliament can stop a disastrous and chaotic exit from the EU.\u201d Starmer says Johnson and his rival for the Tory leadership, the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, have competed over recent weeks in an \u201carms race towards a more and more extreme form of Brexit. Deeper red lines, even more ludicrous promises, but absolutely no coherent or workable plan for the country.\u201d Last week the government\u2019s independent forecasting body, the Office for Budget Responsibility, said a no-deal Brexit would plunge Britain into a recession that would shrink the economy by 2%, push unemployment above 5%, and send house prices tumbling by around 10%. It said the result would be a year-long downturn that would increase borrowing by \u00a330bn a year. Hammond suggested in an interview with the French newspaper Le Monde and Germany\u2019s S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung last week that he could vote to bring down a Tory government that sought to drive through no deal against parliament\u2019s wishes. Asked to rule out supporting a no-confidence motion in a Johnson government, the chancellor responded: \u201cI do not exclude anything for the moment.\u201d He added: \u201cI will do everything in my power from my position to make sure that parliament blocks a Brexit without agreement.\u201d The chancellor has also expressed concern about spending pledges and promises to cut taxes made by both Hunt and Johnson during the leadership contest, urging them to \u201cstop and think\u201d before announcing measures that the country will in all probability not be able to afford. Johnson will also come under intense pressure over whether or not to press ahead with the proposed HS2 rail project after it was reported that the costs could surpass the current budget of \u00a356bn by almost \u00a330bn. According to a report in the Financial Times, the chairman of the project, Allan Cook, has written to Bernadette Kelly, the permanent secretary at the Department for Transport, to warn that the high-speed line from London cannot be finished within the official \u00a356bn limit. The paper reported that, according to Cook\u2019s preliminary findings, the project\u2019s final cost could spiral to between \u00a370bn and \u00a385bn. A source close to the project told the newspaper the costs had increased because of a \u201ccombination of poor ground conditions found during the surveying work, the costs of engineering a railway to a very high specification, and the further additional costs of it being designed to run at even higher speeds than other comparable rail projects\u201d. Johnson has said during Tory leadership hustings that he wants a review of the costs of the project. Andy McDonald, shadow transport secretary, said yesterday that additional rail capacity was urgently needed, but that confidence was waning in the government\u2019s ability to deliver HS2. \u201cWe desperately need additional rail capacity that connects with a fully developed Northern Powerhouse rail network,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are critical elements of the advanced railway network that our country needs over the coming decades to address the climate crisis. \u201cWe also proposed a peer review of the project, but the government said no. They should reconsider their stance and embrace that independent review. It is clear that the government and HS2 have a lot of work to do if they\u2019re to restore confidence in this project.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
