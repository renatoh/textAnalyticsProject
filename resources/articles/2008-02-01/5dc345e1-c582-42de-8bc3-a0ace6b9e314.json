People warmed to cryonics, were annoyed about advertising masquerading as quizzes, and we had a classic Mac rant (but pro or anti? You'll have to read it). Click through and enjoy! CRYONICS &gt;&gt; How far we've come in the past decade, to see respectful, balanced articles on the serious work of the cryonics community as the new media norm. longevitymeme.org &gt;&gt; So, cryonicists speaking to the media have backed away from the I [immortality] word (despite the title of cryonics' foundational text), and they've started to downplay the more extravagant claims about cryonic applications of nanotechnology made just a few years ago. No more talk of keeping people in cryosuspension \"for centuries\" if necessary until somebody, some time, can resuscitate them, I suppose. If people frozen today make it in that state to the year 2108 or so, and nobody knows what to do to help them, then out they go to conventional interment. transsurvivalist.blogspot.com FREE ADVERTISING Matthew Inman's abuse (\"How to get online advertising for free\", 14 Feb 2008) of the HTML image tag's \"alt\" attribute (not an \"alt attribute tag\"), intended to make graphical content accessible to people who cannot see images, is akin to an able-bodied person parking in spaces reserved for blue badge holders. Shame on him. Andy Mabbett, Birmingham Your article on the use of widgets to drive links and traffic to commercial sites was an interesting one. However some of the comments you reported fail to highlight the lack of clarity provided by the major engines, such as Google, in this issue; they were also, in some instances, slightly disingenuous. Whilst this is not a technique I would recommend to clients (linking from widgets to sites that have no direct relevance to the widget) it is something that in many ways Google, or at least its employees, have actually encouraged. Matt Cutts, in charge of the team responsible for weeding out spamming techniques, encourages webmasters to create content that people would want to link to, and has even given examples where the linkbait and the site in question are completely unrelated. For example he has praised a Chiropractor who created content that would be of interest to people who work in SEO, which has driven links to help him ranks for terms related to his business (see his post). I fail to see how SEO &amp; a chiropractic surgery have any more in common than a geek test &amp; a dating or finance site. It is this lack of clarity which makes the comments of Danny Sullivan, a man who knows more about search engine marketing than just about anyone else, so surprising. Considering Matt Cutt's comments (which Danny will be aware of), how is what Matt Inman is doing 'pushing it'? If Google is recommending techniques so similar as to be indistinguishable, then why would anyone else complain? It is for the same reason that I find Dan Thornton's comments slightly confusing. Surely someone whose job description, and blog title, suggest knowledge of blog marketing techniques, should be perfectly aware of the reason that widgets like the ones described are provided. With the greatest respect to Mr Thornton, I fear that he has been more than a little na\u00efve and his rather over-the-top comments are a reaction to that. At the end of the day Matt Inman has managed to create very imaginative ways of marketing his, and his employer's, sites. Whilst many may profess not to like his methods, as long as the world's largest search engine encourages people to create content with no relevance to a site's core themes, Matt and others like him will continue to do exactly that. Ciar\u00e1n Norris, SEO and social media director, altogether, London &gt;&gt; Thank God I am rubbish at these widget things. This looks to be the start of a slippery slope. indigoalison.blogspot.com FREE AUSTRALIAN DATA? &gt;&gt; This encapsulates, to me, the most compelling argument for free data. That getting access to data helps us better solve problems; barriers to data make for a less innovative, less healthy country. datalibre.ca DIRECTX GAMING I'm an avid gamer having played Half Life 2, Team Fortress 2, Crysis and all the rest on my one-year-old Dell PC with Win XP (I could bore you with the exact spec). I'm in my mid 30s, am a professional engineer and have a lot of experience with PCs, I've built several myself, repair them as a sideline at work and advise all close family when they are going to buy a new computer. I recently saw an upgrade version of Vista Premium in a local outlet of a national games retailer for \u00a360 and was vaguely tempted until I considered the following: The PC I've got runs all my games at Very High settings at the native resolution of my monitor (with the exception of Crysis but medium settings on that are pretty special) To run the same games on Vista, I will probably need to get more memory (check out the system specs for Crysis) Upgrades to the OS are never simple, easiest way to do this would be to get a new hard disk and install it to there Chances are that some of my other PC hardware will be non Vista compatible. So really, given the amount of extra expense, hassle and lack of any benefit, I can see no sensible reason to run Vista. I'll wait until they give it away free with my next graphics card upgrade. Jeff Fox, Yeovil BROADBAND SPEEDS In response to David Brown, as one who's previously had a similar letter published, complaining about BT's broadband delivered speeds v claimed speed, it seems only fair to say my recent experience has been the exact opposite: significant improvement. I now routinely get 2-4Mbs - not quite the 8 in the ads, but a lot better than it used to be. Alan Paterson, London My problem is with Tiscali offering an upgrade from 1Mb to (up to) 2Mb which has never been remotely realised. The contract includes free line rental so I have mainly been vainly trying to find out why there is no increase in my speed from 1Mb (average obviously much lower). After endless emails I am still no nearer to an answer of any sort. I am frustrated rather than angry that nobody takes the problem seriously is distance from the exchange a reason and why can they not tell me. Brian Storey, Christchurch, Dorset DRM I am an old fogey with no strong desire to steal music and movies. I subscribe to satellite TV and pay for the videos I rent. The most infuriating part of copyright protection for me is the regional setting on DVDs. I live in North America, (DVD region 1). From time to time, my family in the UK send me DVDs bought in Britain and which are unobtainable in North America. Of course, these DVDs are region 2. They will not play on my DVD player because the player is permanently set only to region 1. This is the equivalent of buying a book printed in English in Britain but being physically prevented from reading it in North America. If the British DVD was available in a North American regional setting, I could understand the desire of the manufacturer to separate the two markets with two regional settings. However the DVDs of interest are not released in other formats. Yes, there are technical fixes like using a second DVD player set to the European regional setting or viewing the DVD on my computer which permit changing the regional setting a maximum of six times. There are probably lots of \"cracks\" which would put me into the criminal classes, but all I want to do is to view a legally bought DVD away from its region of origin. Setting the DVD regional code to region 0 would solve the problem and make the video universally available. Sometimes necessity is the mother of hacking. Alan Mellors, Guelph, Ontario MAC USERS I enjoyed Andrew Brown's article but as a Mac User over the last 12 years I found it contained a number of inaccuracies. \"Whether it is in any other way better than a modern PC is a question with an unobvious answer. It's very hard to think of anything that is possible only on a Mac, and the idea that one interface is more intuitive than the other seems to me palpable nonsense. Both are reasonably consistent, and both rely on conventions that have to be learned.\" Not really. Has he ever heard of iLife. Even Paul Thurrott uses who is the author of The Windows Supersite uses iLife for his photos and music and he bought his journalist wife a Mac because she never could get used to the faffing about and maintenance for necessary for Windows. The Windows UI lacks consistency: menus, dialog boxes, and appearances can vary widely across applications. The file search system is extremely rudimentary. The way you can tell how a good UI is when someone is unfamiliar with the system. One of the Windows magazines got several of their writers together and they faced off against a 9 year old boy with a new Mac: They both had to set up a computer and get on the Internet . The nine-year-old boy with the Mac beat them to the post. Recently on C5's The Gadget Show had competition between Jason (a new Mac user on a MacBook) and Suzi (experienced Windows User on a Sony Vaio) to do several tasks, WP, photo editing and film editing and see who would finish first. No contest, Jason won hands down. Suzi could not find files and menus were inconsistent with what she needed, buried in submenus. (Read it here.) The UI on Mac Leopard is uncluttered, efficient and logical, provides consistency and searches file metadata. PC Advisor (a Windows magazine) recently rated XP, Vista, Leopard and Ubuntu. They rated the interfaces XP 3*, Vista and Ubuntu 4* and Leopard 5*. They also rated other aspects of the OS's and they came out Vista 3*, XP and Ubuntu 4* and Leopard 5*. I use them all and that is where I would put them too. \"But Mac users do pay for the software they use. They even pay for their operating system upgrades.\" A bit of an Apple and Oranges comparison here. Windows Upgrades tend to be for multiple bug fixes and do not cost, nor should they. Apple has no cost Upgrades within Leopard such as 10.5.1, 10.5.2 which do similar things and often add a few more features. Apple major Upgrades such as Tiger (10.4) to Leopard (10.5) do cost but 300 new features were added to the OS, just not bug fixes. There is an added advantage of a Family Pack that costs about \u00a330 more that lets you put the OS on up to 5 Macs in your house (this represents about 35% of Apple's OS sales and is very popular). Only one version of the Mac OS is offered not 7! The cost of the upgrade was under \u00a3100 not \u00a3400 and my 2001 Quicksilver can run the latest OS. Try the same with Vista! \"Beyond that, there is the imponderable factor of snobbery. Mac users so sincerely believe themselves superior to the rest of us that it's possible that this makes them pay more attention to style and finish.\" I don't feel that I am superior to anyone. I might think that OSX is better than Windows when I see my my Windows using brethren do a total reinstall every three months because their system gets cluttered. (Not even the data and OS are separate, what dunce designed that?) As Andrew Brown mentions I might feel very good about just having the right application for the right need (ie Scrivener, Yojimbo, BBedit, Mailsmith, Nisus Writer Pro) rather than see someone struggle along with an unsuitable application designed for a clerk at the office. Mac users are not snobs, smug yes - snobs no. I like the Technology section of the Guardian in spite of a severe bias to Microsoft and Windows and all their accompanying faults and shortcomings (DOJ, EU). Try and get more Mac and Linux users on your staff - the bias would disappear. (name and address supplied)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
