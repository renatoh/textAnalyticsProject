He would say that, wouldn\u2019t he? How many times have we seen warnings that nothing is to be gained from horse trading and threats to put legislation to a vote \u2013 only for the government to agree to a necessary compromise? But in this case, the threat has a little extra piquancy because it sets the Coalition on a collision course with Labor over income tax cuts. Senate showdowns on big business tax cuts through the 45th parliament held little political risk for Labor, allowing it to vote against cuts for the \u201ctop end of town\u201d. It was a play that eventually forced the Coalition to separate tax cuts for small to medium enterprises. But on income tax cuts, to vote against stage three of the plan, which involves flattening tax rates for those earning between $45,000 and $200,000 \u2013 Labor would have to vote against the first stage, which delivers an extra $550 in tax relief for low and middle income earners. On Friday, Anthony Albanese said Labor was still waiting for \u201cinformation about what the impact is in terms of budget for various income groups\u201d. \u201cWe will make a sober assessment based upon the facts,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t do also is disregard the impact on the economy.\u201d When parliament resumes in the first week of July, Labor will face the political risk of standing in the way of legislation to effectively double the size of tax cuts for low and middle income earners, just as Australians are starting to prepare their tax returns. But a Senate vote is not without risk for the Coalition. Perhaps voters will blame it for refusing to split the bill rather than Labor for opposing stage three. And if Labor holds its nerve and votes against the package, it will put a spotlight on Scott Morrison\u2019s incorrect claim during the election campaign that the cuts could be delivered administratively by the tax office with the full benefit flowing from 1 July. Instead, the tax office will have to reassess claims and send a supplementary tax return cheque to eligible households if and when the legislation passes. Delay will also have implications for the economy. With sluggish growth demanding further fiscal stimulus, the Coalition is locked in to its existing spending commitments and has little room to move without blowing projected skinny surpluses. The last thing the government needs is for the shot in the arm from tax cuts to be delayed. Although the last Senate seat in Queensland is still in doubt, with the Greens\u2019 Larissa Waters ahead and Labor\u2019s Chris Ketter still a chance, the make-up of the upper house is relatively clear. With the Coalition expected to win 35 seats and a reliable vote from Australian Conservative Cory Bernardi, the government will need One Nation\u2019s two votes and one from either Jacqui Lambie or the Centre Alliance to pass legislation. Lambie and the Centre Alliance are already in talks about sticking together to maximise their leverage and hold the balance of power. It may not be enough for the Centre Alliance to be granted its demand for domestic gas reservation. Cormann has told Sky News ideas like that should be judged \u201con their own merits\u201d. \u201cWe will continue to engage with them in good faith \u2013 but as far as our plan for income tax relief for all working Australians is concerned, it\u2019s a plan we took to the election. \u201cIf the Labor party is not prepared to vote for a plan \u2026 that puts more money in workers\u2019 pockets \u2026 a few weeks after the Australian people voted for it, when would they support such a package?\u201d Clearly the government wants to deal itself out of a messy engagement with the crossbench by making use of the straightest path through the Senate \u2013 votes from Labor."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
