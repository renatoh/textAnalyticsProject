Mourinho is in Munich for Wednesday night\u2019s return Group B fixture, although there is not the same degree of jeopardy given that both clubs have already qualified for the knock-out rounds. Bayern have suffered back-to-back Bundesliga defeats and are in turmoil as they lag seventh in their domestic division but, to Mourinho, the recent past was not a principal concern. \u201cI forbid any image of it [the 7-2],\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cI watched it a couple of times: me, my staff and analysts try to go through every single aspect of that but not one single image for the boys. No. Not at all. We\u2019re going to focus more on us than on Bayern. \u201cWe\u2019re going to try to develop our model of play, with different bodies, different phases, different players. But there is a certain way that we try to play football and try to develop our principles of play. And we\u2019re totally focused on us.\u201d Mourinho has left 10 players in London, resting Serge Aurier, Jan Vertonghen, Dele Alli and Harry Kane. In addition Hugo Lloris, Michel Vorm, Ben Davies, Harry Winks, Tanguy Ndombele and \u00c9rik Lamela are injured. He is set to start with the youngsters Kyle Walker-Peters, Juan Foyth and Ryan Sessegnon. The line-up will still feature established quality and he expects his defence to be given an exacting test by the prolific Bayern striker, Robert Lewandowski. \u201cYou think our team is the same without Harry Kane?\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same. And, of course, Bayern depend a little on Lewandowski. Their coach thinks differently to me. I left Harry Kane at home, and I expect Lewandowski to play. But maybe he gets injured [on Wednesday night] and doesn\u2019t play at the weekend \u2013 so it\u2019s better he thinks twice and doesn\u2019t play Lewandowski! \u201cI arrive in mid-season, without four, five, six weeks to work and know the players \u2013 so we have to do everything while we are running. It\u2019s very important to me that the players are coachable and open. I think the boys need me and my job is to help them.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
