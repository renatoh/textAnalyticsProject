Just six companies came to the main market in 2009, with another 10 seeking listings on Aim, the exchange for smaller companies. Funds raised from investors slumped to \u00a31.2bn, from \u00a37.4bn in 2008. Gartmore's recent market debut was disappointing, with shares trading below the offer price despite the fund manager dropping the price at the last moment to get the issue away. It raised about \u00a3300m that will be used to pay off debt. The rush by companies to plug their balance sheets by seeking funds from shareholders via rights issues or share placings reached an all-time high, raising about \u00a380bn. The biggest rights call was from Lloyds Banking Group, which raised \u00a313.5bn, with HSBC not far behind at \u00a312bn. Other firms that have launched moves to raise fresh capital include Standard Chartered, which raised \u00a31bn; the mining group Xstrata, which sought \u00a34.5bn; Rio Tinto, pictured, at \u00a34.1bn, and the venture capital firm 3i, which tapped investors for \u00a3732m. David Wilkinson, UK head of IPOs at Ernst &amp; Young, predicts an increase in flotation activity in Britain in the first half of 2010, with private equity-backed companies leading the charge. The merged AA/Saga business, called Acromas, could be one of the biggest flotations in Europe if its private equity owners \u2013 Permira, CVC and Charterhouse \u2013 press ahead with a \u00a35bn-\u00a36bn listing. Others pondering stock market launches include the retailer New Look (\u00a31.7bn), Betfair (\u00a31.5bn), Bird's Eye (\u00a31bn) and Pets at Home (\u00a3650m). The privately owned Matalan, worth about \u00a31.5bn, is said to be considering its options. However, Wilkinson added: \"With economic recovery some way off, there is concern that future bad economic news could destabilise the market, which could in turn lead to a relatively short IPO window. Companies should be getting themselves to a state of readiness so that they can react quickly to opportunities when they arise.\" A private equity source believes firms are having to rush forward flotation plans before a second recession hits the market. Experts warn, however, that only those in a relatively sound position are ready to consider a flotation. Some high-profile leveraged buyouts, including Foxtons, the London-based estate agents, face potential problems with banking covenants \u2013 the rules attached to their loans \u2013 because of their large debts. Some face a \"refinancing wall\" from 2012, the expiry date for many loans agreed at the peak of the market in 2006 and 2007. They will struggle as banking covenants get tougher and the loan approaches maturity, bankers say. Jim Karp, of Goldman Sachs, said private equity firms would have to take tough decisions \"like putting in more money or walking away\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
