In Spain\u2019s opening match at Russia 2018 against Portugal De Gea spilled a Cristiano Ronaldo shot to allow a soft goal in the 3-3 draw. This came after he committed a similar error in the warm-up game against Switzerland that led to Ricardo Rodr\u00edguez scoring. Herrera believes De Gea\u2019s usual impeccable goalkeeping means the mistakes were harshly highlighted. \u201cI don\u2019t care what the critics say,\u201d the midfielder said. \u201cHe is the best goalkeeper in the world, by far, and he will show it again. When you are the best goalkeeper in the world and you don\u2019t make those amazing saves, everyone is going to talk. When I don\u2019t play very well, I don\u2019t get that criticism because I am not one of the best in the world, but he is, so it\u2019s normal and he will cope with it. \u201cHe is so strong. I remember when I was in Spain and he signed for the club [in 2011], the first couple of months were hard for him and he became the best goalkeeper in the world in the next four years, so I am very relaxed about him. We are very lucky to have him.\u201d De Gea will receive a boost from United fans when he joins the tour of the US next week, according to Herrera. \u201cThey are very loyal. They have already shown that to him and he knows he\u2019s going to get them back. We are very relaxed because he is going to show again that he is the best in the world and he will give us again eight or 10 points this season. \u201cI remember that difficult summer [2015] when everyone was talking about Real Madrid and he played the first game at Old Trafford and everyone was singing his name and he told me: \u2018This is amazing, they are the best.\u2019\u201d With many senior players resting after the World Cup, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s tour squad features a number of youngsters: RoShaun Williams, Axel Tuanzebe, Demetri Mitchell, James Garner, Ethan Hamilton, Tahith Chong, Angel Gomes, Mason Greenwood and Joshua Bohui. Mitchell, Tuanzebe, Gomes, Chong and Greenwood featured in the 1-1 draw with Club Am\u00e9rica in the opening match in Phoenix. Herrera said: \u201cThey are very good. They are training fantastic. This club \u2013 one of the things I like the most is that we give a lot of importance to the academy. Not every team in the Premier League can say the same. We are the biggest club in the Premier League but we give a lot of importance to the academy.\u201d Of Chong, an 18-year-old forward, he said: \u201cChong was very good in the second half in my opinion and the other kids didn\u2019t have too much time but they will. I like him because he is very brave. When he trains he is not scared of trying new things and taking people on in one-on-ones. He wants to learn and he listens a lot in training. \u201cI am also very surprised about Garner. Angel also has a lot of quality and the striker [Greenwood], I didn\u2019t know he was 16 years old and he was fighting against men, so I am very confident and I hope one day that they kick our ass out of the club. That will show that the club is doing the right things.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
