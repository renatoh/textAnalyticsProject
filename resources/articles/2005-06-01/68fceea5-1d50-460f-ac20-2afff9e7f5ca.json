Although the song is notoriously ventriloquial, we were convinced its author had been on the roof. The male cuckoo will probably continue to court and sing to his local female for several weeks as she lays her season's quota of eggs, which can be anything up to 25. One of the more intriguing mysteries is how female cuckoos sometimes deposit eggs in a swallow's nest that's jammed up tight against a barn roof beam. The answer lies in a remarkably extrusive cloaca, from which it literally squirts into the nest, but the truth seemed so improbable that until the 1930s debate raged among members of the British Ornithologists' Club. The two key protagonists were the Rev Francis Jourdain, known to his friends - and enemies - as Pastor Pugnax and a zealous egg-collector called Percy Bunyard, who vehemently maintained that the cuckoo laid the egg then swallowed it to regurgitate it later into the nest. Their arguments were infamous, and whenever the club gathered the other members scrambled to get ringside seats. Mercifully Bunyard was as deaf as a post but would aim his long-handled hearing-aid towards the torrent of invective that Jourdian unleashed in his direction. The discussion became so heated that bloodshed was sometimes feared and the subject was eventually ruled out of court by club officials. The conflict was resolved in quintessentially British fashion: a committee was created to investigate the matter, then promptly failed ever to deliver any judgement."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
