Mr Burrell has vowed to take this secret to his grave - but speculation about the contents of the elusive tape has reached feverish proportions ever since he made his claims about an \"explosive\" fact that could destroy the royal family. The royals fear it is only a matter of time before details emerge abroad or on the internet.
