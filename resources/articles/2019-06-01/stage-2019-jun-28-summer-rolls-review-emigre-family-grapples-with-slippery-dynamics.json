Or a sneaky spliff rolled by their unruly daughter? Double meanings lie at the heart of the intriguing Summer Rolls by Tuyen Do. It\u2019s an intimate domestic drama, sketched with compassion and steely honesty, about a family who have left war-torn Vietnam and are struggling to forge a shared future in the safety (or is that boredom?) of Essex. The shifting dynamics \u2013 as slippery as the language that young Mai\u2019s parents struggle to adopt \u2013 are fascinating to observe. At the centre of the home (coolly lit by Jessica Hung Han Yun) is the mother, otherwise unnamed and played with a brittle ferocity by Linh-Dan Pham. She is the family\u2019s fulcrum: the one who sets the tone (tense), who holds together the family sewing business (fragile), who later runs the restaurant (success!) and who still, when desperately ill, commands the family with a blazing love that is both frightening and comforting. The director, Kristine Landon-Smith, neatly (sometimes a little too much so) sketches in the family\u2019s stories, past and present, which play out around the periphery of the mother\u2019s domain. The father (Kwong Loke) is haunted by wartime demons; son Anh (Michael Phong Le) is pushed to the edges of a country he struggles to embrace; and daughter Mai (a bolshy Anna Nguyen) and her black boyfriend David (Keon Martial-Phillip) flirt in the shadows, afraid to share their love with a family \u201cstill fighting a war\u201d in their heads. Above them all hang Mai\u2019s photos of the local Vietnamese community. These images speak of a war-torn past that can never be fully expressed in words, in any language. At the Park theatre, London, until 13 July"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
