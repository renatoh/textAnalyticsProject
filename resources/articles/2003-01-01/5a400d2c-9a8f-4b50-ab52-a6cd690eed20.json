Thousands of miles away in Kingston, Jamaica, there was a similar thing going on: at Randy's Records, artists would congregate to hear the latest US funk and soul releases before going away to create their own versions. Randy's eventually became a record label and it is the source, along with Impact Records, of this compilation of gloriously funky reggae, which perfectly captures the haphazard, freewheeling atmosphere of the times, and, more intimately, of the shop. Augustus Pablo wanders in next to some wonderfully talented people called Tommy McCook and Randy's All Stars, Winston Cole tackles Fleetwood Mac, somebody is shouting and a dog is whining - all blissfully unaware that history was being made."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
