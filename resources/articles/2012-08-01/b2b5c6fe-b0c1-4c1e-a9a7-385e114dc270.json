And, to a degree, he has been as good as his word. The mogul's management standards operation has been shopping journalists to the police with a frequency that even an East End nark would find alarming. But the broom, we fear, hasn't quite swept clean other parts of the Murdoch empire, where still there are alleged transgressions that would worry Lord Justice Leveson. One such is a big story that appeared last week on the front page of Murdoch's Post-Courier in Papua New Guinea. \"Govt approves seabed mining,\" it said, and it was jolly exciting. Just as exciting, notes a blogger, as it was when the same story appeared in the Guardian on 6 August. Written for us by Australian journalist Oliver Milman, the story quoted protester Helen Rosenbaum. \"PNG is the guinea pig for deep sea mining,\" she told him. \"The mining companies are waiting in the wings ready to pile in. It's a new frontier, which is a worrying development.\" Which is exactly as she was quoted in the Post-Courier version. Milman also spoke directly to Wenceslaus Magun, an activist: \"We are really concerned because the sea is the source of our spirituality and sustenance,\" said the activist.\" The company has not explained to us the risks of deep sea mining.\" And guess what, he apparently said exactly the same thing in exactly the same way to the Murdoch paper. Steve Rogers, chief executive of Nautilus, the company leading the mining, promised: \"This will be a relatively small footprint compared to a mine on land, on an area about the size of a dozen football pitches. \"We've sought out the best scientists in the world. We aren't trying to pull the wool over anyone's eyes.\" Which, again, is exactly as he was quoted in the Post-Courier. Milman tells us from Perth that he had no dealing with the paper. Which could mean that there have been a lot of coincidences. It could also mean that Rupert owes him a nice fat cheque. \u2022 The busiest day for British border staff, as the Olympians and those associated fly home. And arising from a busy weekend, a message to Theresa May from the UK border toilers at Calais-Fr\u00e9thun Eurostar station: \"Buy us some new computers!\" This would avoid the half-hour delay that occurred last Saturday evening as 20 or so passengers \u2013 including small children \u2013 had to stand waiting while staff went to find a replacement laptop. French police IT worked like a dream. \"Nos coll\u00e8gues britanniques sont bloqu\u00e9s comme toujours,\" (\"Our British colleagues are blocked as usual\") was their half-pitying, half-amused comment. Get Lord Coe on to it, we say. He can fix anything. \u2022 You love Mo Farah, we love Mo Farah. The Olympian's Olympian has one of the most recognisable faces on the planet. Recognisable perhaps even to border force officials, who apparently took a good hard look at unassuming Mo as he entered his country to do his bit in the Olympics. One suspects that won't happen again. \u2022 And there was a heartfelt adieu in Tower Hamlets, London, where the mayor Lutfur Rahman bade farewell to the army and navy personnel who had set up a temporary billet near the Tower of London. Well done, our boys and girls, said Rahman, the first directly elected Muslim mayor; and by way of thanks he promised them all a Brick Lane curry. A notable spectator was Helen Mirren, who posed with everybody. Or it might have been the Queen. So hard to tell these days. \u2022 Who else will be sad that the Olympics is over? Well there may well be a post-Games dip among members of L Ron Hubbard's Scientology organisation. For they seemed to be doing good business around Tower Bridge, handing out literature linked to the organisation. The little booklets promised The Truth About Drugs. Neither Scientology nor L Ron are mentioned. Just his Foundation for a Drug-Free World, the web address for which sits on the Scientology website. Everyone was fair game this weekend. Even a passing 15-year-old. That sort of opportunity might not come again. Twitter: @hugh_muir"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
