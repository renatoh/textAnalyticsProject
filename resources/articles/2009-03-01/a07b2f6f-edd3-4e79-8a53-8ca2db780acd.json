After reading the comments, and taking into account some advice from friends, I felt I should add some more explanation. I don't want anyone to think I am exulting at journalists losing jobs, which I deplore. I am sorry if that was how it came across. It was not my intention. An industry is collapsing around our ears. Every day brings more bad news. The companies that publish regional and local papers are in such dire straits that there is little surprise at today's statement by Johnston Press that it has suffered the largest revenue fall in its history. Nor should we be too surprised at Guardian Media Group's decision to make 95 redundancies in Surrey and Berkshire while closing two paid-for titles. These announcements follow two days of turmoil in which GMG has also found it necessary to dispense with the services of 150 employees in the Manchester area; Northcliffe Media has axed 95 jobs; the Observer Standard Media Group has been forced into administration; and Archant's chief executive Adrian Jeakings has warned of more publishers ending up in the hands of receivers. These are truly distressing decisions. Many people may well be fired because not all the job losses will involve voluntary redundancies. That is a new departure, a sign of just how desperate publishers are becoming. This may not be the most appropriate time to point this out, but it does not necessarily mark the end of all local journalism because the major victims of these cuts are freesheets, most of which contain very little proper journalistic content. Of the 53 closures I detailed on February 19, Britain's vanishing newspapers, 52 were frees. The majority of those now slated for closure are also frees. Though I am concerned about journalists losing their jobs, I cannot view the fact that freesheets are going to the wall as a major blow to journalism itself. The overwhelming majority of them publish pseudo-journalism. They are a pretence and their departure will be no loss to democracy. They have always been commercial rather than journalistic products. Yes, I know there are some good ones, such as the Camden New Journal. I also know there are several campaigning free community papers, such as the Salford Star. And I take on board the fact that commenters point to two other notable titles, the Redditch Standard and the Salford Advertiser. But these are the exceptions. Most have little worthwhile editorial content. I am relaxed about their demise because they tend to bring the local newspaper form into disrepute. They give people, especially those who have never experienced anything else, entirely the wrong impression about newspapers. Rather than lure young people towards newsprint they have surely tended to turn them off. They are classic examples of \"the local rag\", packed with puffs, PR-sourced material and scant public service information, let alone the kind of editorial that holds local power to account. What is troubling is that the cuts have bitten deep into paid-for papers too, and those cuts are getting deeper as the weeks pass. This would not be such a concern if the papers' websites were being properly resourced and providing the kind of content that will retain and enlarge audiences. I fear, however, that closure of print will also mean accompanying online closures. That, surely, would be a threat to democracy. It will mean that power will be exercised without any check at all. It suggests that the Fourth Estate is going into full retreat. Publishing companies - meaning, in the main, investors and senior executives - reaped large rewards in the good times, not least from the bumper ad revenues generated by freesheets. They are merely following the logic of business by turning their backs on them now. But journalism, though it depends on commerce to function, has a use value for society that places it on a different plane from other kinds of business. What we have to hope - and hope is about all there is right now - is that freesheets are the only papers we lose in this recession. I think we can do without most of them without shedding too many tears."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
