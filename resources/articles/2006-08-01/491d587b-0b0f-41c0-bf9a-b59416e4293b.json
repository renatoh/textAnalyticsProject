I'd always assumed, naively I now realise, that newsreader hair was born not made, or at least, that having newsreader hair was a key talent required for the job. And, so even though I am about to interview Fiona Bruce and even though I have turned up at the photographic studio where this shoot is taking place and even though, theoretically, I know that the woman walking towards me and shaking my hand must, in fact, be Fiona Bruce, I still don't recognise her. She's in the most brilliant celebrity disguise I've ever seen. It really isn't an exaggeration to say that you'd walk past her in the street and have no idea who she was. Because in place of the big bouffy hairsprayed newsreader pelmet, there are just some unruly little curls. And instead of a foundation-blusher-powder masque, her skin is covered by only a light smattering of freckles, and she's dressed not in her usual power suit but a pair of long denim shorts, a T-shirt and pair of flip-flops. It's like being back at school and bumping into your teacher at the weekend wearing jeans. It is, somehow, indefinably, wrong. Still, though, I do get to witness the transformation for myself: from north London mummy (she's dressed for her children's sports day later that afternoon) to Britain's highest-paid newscaster. We chat while her make-up man from the BBC does whizzy things with a foundation spray gun that looks like something you'd use to re-plaster a wall and then out comes the hair dryer and the big bristle brush and the little pots of eye shadow and lip gloss and then I must have got distracted and looked away because when I turn round, there, suddenly, is Fiona Bruce. 'Wow!' I say. 'That's quite a transformation.' 'I know,' she says. \"On the one hand, it's really quite gratifying but then on the other hand there's something a bit depressing about the fact I look so different.' She does look different. So entirely different, in fact, that it makes me realise that there's a very specific type of femininity that we've been taught to expect from the women who deliver our news: attractive but not overtly sexy, fashionable but not too fashionable, groomed but not tarty. They have faces that have been professionally painted and glossed, and heads furnished with hair that is neither too long nor too short but looks like it's been primed to withstand a chance force-10 gale that might just happen to blow through the studio. A newsreader, I realise, without newsreader hair, is a tautology. For her, though, it's all just part of the job. A really, quite boring part, mind, that takes ages and while the photographer, Harry Borden, and the stylist and the picture editor and I sit around drinking coffee and eating croissants and hearing about the time Harry vomited into his own motorcycling helmet, Fiona, you can see, is just dying to join in, but is trapped up against the mirror. She keeps trying to swivel round in her chair and butt in but her grooming demands keep her separate from the rest of us. But then, newsreading gender divisions are so obviously unfair that it hardly needs pointing out that men who read the news just have to turn up in a suit and not sport any too-noticeable nostril hair. The day that a female version of Stephen Sackur or Andrew Marr shows up on the news will be the day full equality finally arrives. As it is, men are allowed to be old, they can even be ugly, whereas it really doesn't take a crack team of prize sudoku-winning code-breakers to figure out that Fiona Bruce, Natasha Kaplinsky, Sophie Raworth, Katie Derham, Mary Nightingale, Kirsty Young and Emily Maitlis are linked by more than their clearly enunciated vowels. At 42, Fiona Bruce is the elder stateswoman of the pack with more gravitas than most of the rest put together but the fact remains that, here, now, in 2006, female newsreaders have to be every bit as able and as qualified as their male counterparts. They just have to be really good-looking too. 'I don't think that's strictly true,' she says when we finally get to talk after the primping and the shooting and the standing round in really quite extraordinarily high heels. 'The standards by which a woman's appearance is judged on the news are different to men, there's no question about that. Our clothes are different, for starters, they're much more varied, they're commented upon, there's no question about that. But do you have to be really good-looking? I don't think that's true. I think that as long as you look OK it doesn't really matter. There's an added dimension as a woman, undoubtedly, but I don't think you have to be hot, or really good-looking.' It's a nice theory although it's rather ruined by the fact that she is really good-looking. And there's plenty of evidence out there in cyberspace to prove that a lot of men do find her hot (it's the rather prim outfits and slightly school-marmish delivery that seems to send them into really quite disturbing bad-spelling-filled fantasies). Her lookalike on Dead Ringers is a case in point, a vamp who crawls across the screens saying things like, 'Hello, my name is Fiona Bruce, and let me tell you there's no hosepipe ban when I'm around!' Or 'Hello, my name is Fiona Bruce sitting on the luckiest chair in Britain!' And, anyway, not minutes before saying this to me, I'd watched her sprawled across a leather sofa in a dress that showed a glimpse of what Tony Parsons, after seeing her in a mini-skirt on Children in Need, called 'the best legs on screen since Cyd Charisse in Silk Stockings'. There's a moment later in the interview, when she tells me how she once did a programme about the first female newsreader, Nan Winton, 'and there was a hilarious quote from the time which said something like, \"What a shame she keeps her 36-24-36 figure behind a desk!\"' But, actually, the way that female newsreaders are treated in the press hasn't come on a whole lot since then. The mini-skirt incident generated full-page photos in all the tabloids and in any case, it's broadcasting orthodoxy that the news is read by an authoritative older man and a younger attractive woman. 'I know that it's true that it has been like that. But Huw and I are more or less the same age. With George and Sophie there's not a huge age gap. And George and Natasha a bit more so ...' It's a valiant effort on her part and she tactfully ignores the other half of the age-looks equation but then she's in an impossible position. Because it's 'Huw' as in Edwards, 'George' as in Aligiah, 'Natasha' as in Kaplinsky and 'Sophie' as in Raworth. And that's Sophie Raworth of whom Richard Ingrams said (a couple of years back) that 'when Mr Blair starts to bomb Baghdad we shall be informed of the fact by a smiling bimbo with a perfect set of teeth'. It's a comment that more or less perfectly illustrates the kind of double standards that afflict our news bulletins: you have to be good-looking to get the job. But the fact that you are good-looking will be used as evidence that you're not up to the job. But then everybody seems to have it in for newsreaders. If it's not Richard Ingrams, it's Jon Snow complaining that they're are overpaid and underqualified, Andrew Marr saying their only skill is in 'reading an Autocue', John Humphrys claiming that it's not a job that requires a brain, and Kate Adie saying that they've got 'cute faces, cute bottoms, and nothing in between'. It's when I quote this last one that she snaps. 'Well, my bottom isn't very cute and I hope I've got plenty in between ... It's not a view I share, and I don't feel I have to defend myself against it. Really, I've been at the BBC too long and have spent too much time out on the road to worry about being judged as a clothes horse.' She's right, of course, she spent years at the journalistic coalface producing and reporting for Panorama and Newsnight. And there's more than a whiff of misogyny to the idea that a beautiful woman must be dumb. But then, if anybody knows this, and if anybody is going to appreciate the irony and inherent contradiction of being photographed in a glamorous outfit while being interviewed about how unfair it is that women are judged on their looks, it's her, because she's that most unfashionable of things: a feminist. 'I do consider myself a feminist. Very much so. And I find it very sad that 75 per cent of women don't, according to Company magazine. The contradictions are still there which is why I think feminism is still very relevant for me and it's just such a shame that it's become a byword for mustachioed, man-hating women from Lebanon.' Ah, it's so rare that you come across this kind of statement these days that it's really quite heart-warming. I can't remember the last time I heard a woman in the public eye talk so freely about the f-word. What's more, she's a proper woman's woman: 'I'm always very suspicious and rather disappointed by women who say they prefer working with men. What is that all about? I love working with women, I love the company of women. Your hear women say, oh women can be so hormonal and I just think you're just dissing yourself! What is that all about? It's just ridiculous.' Her politics, it turns out, are a legacy from her student days. She went from a south London comprehensive school to Hertford College, Oxford, where she claims she was 'ludicrously chippy': 'I was the first person in my family to go to university so it was quite a big deal for us ... and then I got there and I looked around and thought these people have just wandered in here and they've just got in because of their school or their name ... I wised up eventually, but I think it stopped me enjoying things as much as I might have done. 'There were all these clubs for everything and I thought, no, I'm not going to be doing that, I'm going to be Reclaiming The Night. And I am going to be manning the Rape Crisis Line. And I am going to be setting up my own women's group in Hertford. I was terribly earnest. I remember my dad saying to me, \"But Fiona don't you want to go and do the dramatic society? You can still do your women's groups as well.\" And I said, \"Dad, feminism is a way of life! It's not a hobby!\" I really did take myself very seriously.' She's lightened up considerably since then, and is quite happy to tell you that she 'really fancies' David Beckham or to tell tales from her mailbag including one about an admirer who 'said as a PS that he had a medium-sized penis! I mean, my God! If you're going to refer to it, you'd think that you'd at least claim you were a pole-vaulter!'. And for a girl from a south London comp, she has a jolly-hockeystickish good humour about her - there are a lot of 'ghastly!'s in my transcript and a not inconsiderable number of 'wonderful!'s). It's a brightness and a breeziness that gives her an air of being self-confident without ever being arrogantly over-confident, a talent that allegedly makes her the highest-paid journalist at the BBC, earning \u00a3400,000 a year. And although I'm loath to give the Richard Ingramses of this world any ground, well, he might just have a point. Bruce is a cut above all the other Sophies and Katies. Mary Nightingale was a holiday presenter before being recruited to news. Natasha Kaplinsky was a press officer. (And Darren Jordon, it's worth noting for the record, was at Sandhurst before going into sports presenting and thence to the One O'Clock News If the BBC senior management could clone Bruce, there's little doubt they would. As it is she does Fridays and every other Sunday on News at Ten, then there's Crimewatch and Real Story as well as various one-off series and in all of them she somehow manages to pull off the trick of being authoritative but not intimidating. But her tales from her student days give the interview a certain piquancy. She tells me about an 'absolutely hilarious anti-pornography exhibition' she put on when at university which was a smash hit because all the blokes went to look at the nice photos of naked ladies, and it strikes me afterwards that actually it's not such a far-fetched parallel to what she does now. Because we both know that neither of us would be here if she looked like the back end of a bus, that there's something fundamentally unfair about the way she's compared more often to, say, Natasha Kaplinsky, just because she's female, rather than, say, Peter Sissons. She's too smart not to know that this is just the way that the world works and that putting on a posh frock and moue-ing for the camera is all part of how you have to play the game. It's also why I suspect that, earlier this year, she was lured into taking up a Kaplinsky-esque offer of appearing on a celebrity singing programme, The Two of Us, although she freely admits that she now thinks it was a terrible mistake. 'It was probably one of my most miserable ever working experiences. And that was simply because I naively went into it thinking I can just about hold a tune and it will be a laugh. It was much, much more serious than that and it was stupid of me not to have realised that earlier on. 'I was worried afterwards that people wouldn't take me seriously ... but I think in the end that it was for only three days, whereas I've been doing news presenting for eight years.' It's a relief to learn that she's not going any further down the celeb-singy-dancey route. Because while she makes the point that 'outside certain parameters, I don't consider myself that serious a person', and for all that doing The Two of Us was, she thought, 'going to be a laugh', she's one of the very few women on television who does have authority and who isn't afraid to be serious. She still had something of the idealist about her when she went into journalism and her remaining ambitions, she says, would be to do 'something, I've no idea how, but to change the fact that only 5.6 per cent of rape trials end in a conviction' and her other great passion is domestic violence. What's more she's probably the female newsreader who's held out the longest against a rising tide of increasingly pastel clothing and low-cut tops. And although she says she has no anxiety about getting older ('I'm sure the BBC will have tired of me or me of them before it's an issue'), you can see how the women who get the big jobs these days are the ones who are willing to put on a sparkly frock and play the celebrity game. Even so, my mole in the BBC newsroom says that she's by far the best-known presenter on News at Ten despite being the one who's on the least. What's more, he says, she's the only one so far who's really got to grips with the brave new BBC world that saw the newsreaders deprived of their desks. 'She's the only who looks really comfortable standing up. She's just a bit of a natural. And she always rewrites her intros and is involved with discussions about the running order and so on. Whereas there are some of them who just come in and say their lines and then go home again. The only criticism of her that I've ever heard is that she wasn't a big-name foreign correspondent like Buerk or Sissons but then she did do her time on Panorama and Newsnight and Huw Edwards wasn't a big-shot reporter either - he came from being a lobbyist in Westminster.' He also says how very nice she is to work with. Not that this has stopped her being the subject of certain snidey articles in the press. There was a story a few years back that claimed her colleagues called her 'Lady Macbeth' and when she returned to work, for a day, 16 days after her daughter was born, there was a slew of ambitious career-bitch-from-hell-type articles. 'Well I didn't like the Lady Macbeth comment very much, obviously, but I can't say that I dwelt on it because it just seemed rather alien to me so I just let it go. And there was criticism about me returning to work, but maybe because I had just had a baby I didn't read it all. But I didn't come out and feel terribly bruised. 'I obviously have been ambitious, or I wouldn't be here. But I think there is a real dichotomy when it comes to women and ambition. I can't imagine many men being asked if they're ambitious, it's assumed that they are, and I find it odd that I'm asked that. Because obviously I must have some ambition or I wouldn't have worked as hard as I have for as long as I have.' There's a nice little moment in The Insider, Piers Morgan's diaries, when he writes that hours after being sacked, 'A letter popped through the door from Fiona Bruce at BBC News. \"God, what a shock,\" she'd written; \"I'm astonished, never thought this would happen. Would you consider doing an interview with me? I feel shameless in asking this, but it's the business we're in, so forgive me! PS And if you want to be cheered up, watch me tonight on the Ten. I've got an eye infection and look like an albino rabbit with dominatrix glasses. Viewers will be terrified!\"' It just seems very telling: she's sympathetic, chatty and amusing, but never for a moment is in danger of losing sight of the story and the chance for a scoop. Still, the ironic thing, she says, is that she started being criticised 'when I was feeling least ambitious in the sense that I'd got two small children and my ambition was and is defined within very strict parameters because my work is not my priority in the way that it used to be'. Because the fact is that she's is about as close as it's possible to come to that other great tabloid character: The Woman Who Has It All. After university, she had two aborted careers before getting her break in television ('I didn't have any contacts and I assumed that to get into journalism you had to have them'): first as a management consultant ('a truly miserable experience'), then in advertising ('a huge amount of fun, but I realised that it wasn't what I wanted to do for the rest of my life'). Her father is a self-made man who left school at 14 and started his career as a post boy before ending up as managing director of Unilever, and it was inculcated in her that to succeed you had to work hard, 'which is why it never occurred to me to just drift after university. I had to get a job.' It was while working in advertising, though, that she met her husband, Nigel Sharrocks, who was the director at the agency where she was working, and they now have two children: Sam, aged eight, and Mia, four. 'I think there is this tendency to treat women in the papers either as Miss Domesticity or as a complete career bitch, but the reality is that away from the kind of high-profile job that I do, the vast majority of women work. It's just real life. My own work-life balance ebbs and flows - sometimes it's brilliant and sometimes it's dire. And what balance I do achieve is because I can afford to pay for a fabulous nanny who I've had for eight years and that's what makes it possible.' Her husband, she says, is more than happy to be in the background and let her get on with her thing but they did take seriously the implications of her decision to step into the Jill Dando role on Crimewatch. The News of the World reported last year that she had a stalker 'but it's not something I've ever commented on and probably never will actually because one neither wants to invite stalkers or to encourage others to copy them ... and having stalkers or having unwanted attention comes with the territory of being on television.' Which is true but most especially if you're a woman. Which brings us back round, full circle, to the strange hypocritical double standards that haunt you if you happen to be a newsreader and happen to be female. The old guard who broke down many of the barriers in the Seventies and Eighties have all retired, and they haven't all gone quietly. Kate Adie, though not a newsreader, has been vituperative about the way that women on TV are treated as they get older and Anna Ford recently added her voice too: 'I don't think the people you see on our screens reflect the people out there and I'm sure the public would like that - people with character, people with lines on their faces, people who have had experiences of life.' Women, perhaps, who look a bit like Stephen Sackur. Or possibly Andrew Marr. It's not going to happen any time yet, mind, but in the meantime, we have Fiona Bruce."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
