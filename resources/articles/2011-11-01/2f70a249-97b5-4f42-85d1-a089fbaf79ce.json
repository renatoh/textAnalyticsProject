Australian John Torode heads to Scotland to meet an Aberdeen Angus farmer before cooking the beef with Yorkshire puddings. Elsewhere, Valentine Warner sings the praises of indigenous shellfish, discovering, bleakly, that we ship off most of the UK's mussels and that nobody buys cockles any more. Tomorrow, Richard Corrigan praises mackerel while James Martin celebrates eggs, meaning more of his egg-scruciating Saturday Kitchen puns. Rebecca Nicholson The Impressions Show 8.30pm, BBC1 Jon Culshaw and Debra Stephenson offer up another 30 minutes of pretending to be other people. When the show hits home, as in a MasterChef skit where John Torode and Gregg Wallace reckon the contestants are \"like cows at an abattoir\", there's much fun to be had. Paul McCartney reforming the Fab Four with \"all of the surviving Beatles except Ringo\" and the Gok Wan wok gun also hit the mark. At other times, though, don't be surprised if your attention drifts: the show is consistently inventive without necessarily being consistently funny. Jonathan Wright Frozen Planet 9pm, BBC1 At last, it's spring on Frozen Planet, which means one thing: penguins. Well, it means several things, really, but the sight of hundreds of little waddlers coming over a frozen Antarctic hill is bound to melt hearts. Meanwhile, in the north, the polar bears are up and about and ready for some seal-scoffing. Scary sight of the week? Millions of tonnes of ice breaking off as the Arctic's rivers thaw. Hannah Verdier Hot Like Us 9pm, BBC3 It's a shallow search for the \"ultimate model couple\", where judges are on the lookout for a pair of pretties with an apparent emotional bond. Casting director Jody Furlong checks that the couples are pleasing to the eye, while relationship expert Emma Kenny gets under their skin. The opening episode sees the hopefuls posing in an underwear shoot. But wait \u2013 there's a \"relationship task\" on the agenda; they have to choose each other's pants. Which is, in short, as deep as it gets. HV Imagine: And Then There Was Television 9pm, BBC4 John Logie Baird invented television in 1926, but it wasn't until 10 years later that the first, tentative broadcasts went out from Alexandra Palace in north London, with absurdly well-spoken folk addressing the camera in full evening dress. Alan Yentob tracks down some of the engineers and presenters of TV's early years and gets them to reminisce about their pioneering role in paving the way for today's televisual cornucopia, from The X Factor to Cash In The Celebrity Attic. David Stubbs The Pretenders &amp; Friends 10pm, Sky Arts 1 A 2008 concert, live from Atlantic City, New Jersey. Iggy Pop, Kings Of Leon, Incubus and Shirley Manson from Garbage pay tribute to the Hereford new wavers by performing the Pretenders' back catalogue \u2013 alongside Ms Hynde and the boys. Must be a bit like throwing a birthday party and making your guests don costumes to re-enact nice moments from your life. It's one hell of a backing band, anyway. Incubus tackle crowd-pleasers Talk Of The Town, Brass In Pocket and Back On The Chain Gang. Ali Catterall"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
