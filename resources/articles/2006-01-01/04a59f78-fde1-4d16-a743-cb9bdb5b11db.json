One group was founded by Tommy Johnson, a former delinquent and drug dealer, who calls himself Tommy the Clown and created a group of painted harlequins to entertain family audiences and, in effect, to parody the activities of street gangs. The other group practise 'krumping', a form of hip hop dancing that neutralises violence by transforming it into West Side Story-style choreography. Clowning and krumping are now practised by numerous groups, most of them involving former criminals. They regularly compete against each other in dance contests, one major annual event being staged at LA's enormous Great Western Forum. Tragically, while one of these shows was taking place, Tommy's uninsured house in Watts was trashed by thieves and relieved of all his professional props and anything else saleable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
