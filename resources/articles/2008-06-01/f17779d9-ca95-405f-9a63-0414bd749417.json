But this is about to change: from this year most staff over 65 will be forced to leave. The majority of teaching staff at the OU are part-time associate lecturers, and the role has long been popular with retiring academics from the OU and other universities. More than half of all associate lecturers are over 50, and though most retire at 65, a small but significant proportion continue to teach into their late 60s and 70s - it's widely recognised that OU students benefit from the dedication and knowledge of these hugely experienced academics. Of the university's 7,552 associate lecturers, 599 (nearly 8%) are aged 66 and over and there are a further 1,215 over 60. But in October 2006 the government introduced its Employment Equality (Age) Regulations. As a result, the OU could no longer allow part-time associate lecturers to continue working while enforcing retirement at 65 for full-time staff. It could have abandoned retirement ages altogether, but instead it introduced a retirement age of 65 for all, with new criteria limiting the circumstances under which staff might be allowed an extension. Initially, this new retirement age had relatively little effect on associate lecturers. Of the 317 due to retire at the time, 276 asked to stay on and the great majority of them - 256 - were allowed to do so. Luckily for them, the management staff had little time to prepare for the loss of a whole swath of associate lecturers, so almost invariably issued them with two-year extensions, ignoring the new criteria. This year, though, it's a very different story. As associate lecturers over the age of 65 apply for extensions to enable them to continue teaching in September, the OU's criteria for extending the employment contract are being enforced to the letter, and few associate lecturers meet them. The criteria state that staff must fulfil a critical business need, defined as delivering a product, project or equivalent; work in a role where there is a skill shortage; or need to complete time-limited development work. There is no mention of the member of staff's quality of teaching. A 66-year-old associate lecturer will therefore not be allowed to carry on working - even if their line manager testifies that their teaching, supervision and student support are excellent - if the university can recruit someone younger to replace them. No matter that ability, willingness to work and value to an organisation don't automatically vanish the day of someone's 65th birthday. No wonder associate lecturers are crying out that the OU is discriminatory. The OU's own statement of commitment says: \"Discrimination, direct or indirect, based on a person's age ... will not be tolerated. Such forms of discrimination represent a waste of human resources.\" As Lesley Kane, an associate lecturer and branch officer for the University and College Union says, \"What would the public reaction be if any other minority group in society were only allowed to work if no one else wanted the job?\" Predictably, associate lecturers are upset. They talk of the university's hypocrisy, and of its lack of honesty. Why, they ask, does the university write to associate lecturers as they approach 65, asking if they would like to apply for an extension, if the university knows full well that they won't get one except under exceptional circumstances? One member of OU staff at Milton Keynes described this practice as \"ridiculous ... it is discriminatory - if they're working already and they're recruiting new people to replace them, it seems like direct discrimination\". She added: \"It's very difficult to train associate lecturers - there's so much stuff happening. They're a huge resource, and it takes them a while to find their feet.\" Though the OU emphasises \"business need\" in its criteria, it seems to have defined its business needs very narrowly. In an organisation whose main function is to teach, it seems odd not to recognise the importance of high-quality teaching to the organisation. The OU's policy is toppling some prominent research heads too: Colin Pillinger, its professor of planetary sciences and leader of the Beagle 2 mission to Mars, is also being forced to retire in September. The OU says his research only meets its criteria if he guarantees to bring in a major grant to cover it. He says this is wrong in an organisation that claims to believe in lifelong learning. When questioned about the criteria, the university secretary, Fraser Woodburn, said: \"The criteria are about the needs of the organisation rather than the particular abilities of individuals.\" One question that comes up time and again when talking to associate lecturers is why the OU needed to impose a retirement age at all. The legislation does not demand one, and Woodburn is clear that the OU plans to abolish it altogether by 2011, or earlier. For now though, he says that they need to retain it: \"If we didn't, we would be discriminating against younger staff, and would not be able to manage the performance of people beyond retirement age.\" The OU is not alone in struggling with the age equality legislation - it has been a challenge across the whole higher education sector. Roger Walters, president of the UCU's OU branch, is sympathetic about the effect it has had on the institution: \"This position has come about because of a well-intentioned but deeply flawed piece of legislation which has actually had the opposite effect to what was intended - it has promoted rather than eradicated age discrimination.\" So the OU has found itself imposing rules that seem to be in conflict with the equality it stands for. In other institutions academics have been incensed by the way they have been treated, but at the OU they are also shocked and disappointed by what they see as a betrayal of the university's fundamental values. Dr Graham Mott is an associate lecturer in social sciences directly affected by the new criteria. \"There is this perception that the OU needs a fixed retirement age in order to clear out some of the dead wood that has been in post for 30 years or so and is no longer productive. Well, my appointment dates from as recently as 2004 at the age of 62 - well done the enlightened OU for appointing me, I thought at the time. I don't have another academic post and, quite simply, I feel that I still have a great deal to offer the OU.\" Mott's anger and frustration at what is happening to him is made all the worse by the knowledge that the OU is committed to abolishing the retirement age: \"It's like anti-smoking legislation, or women bishops - everyone knows it's going to happen, it's only a question of slapping the forces of reaction around enough until they retreat. Meanwhile, I find it immensely frustrating, and peculiarly discriminatory, to feel that I happen to have hit the wrong age at the wrong time.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
