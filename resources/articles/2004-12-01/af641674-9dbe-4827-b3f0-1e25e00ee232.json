It almost feels as if Bing Crosby is in the room. And who is this bearded fellow magically whipping out a brand new angel from behind his back to place on the tree? Is it Dad dressed as Santa Claus? Actually no, it's Martin from accounts and this is the office, not a family gathering. Surely we can do without Christmas trees and decorations in the workplace? The office is already split in two; there's the pro-Christmas group who decided that decorating the room \"to get everyone in the mood\" was a good idea. Whether it is a Norwegian pine hung with miniature gingerbread mansions, or a reality-check theme involving decorations of Alka-Seltzer and mini bottles of Scotch, you can guarantee that group two will not be impressed. The anti-Yule misanthropes have been whingeing since October that \"Christmas starts too early\" and successfully had all decorations banned from the office before December 1. But now the pro-Christmas people are putting up tinsel round the windows and mistletoe over the doors. The Santa hats have become uniform and their wearers are sneering \"Bah! Humbug\" at anyone who dismisses Christmas as nothing more than an over-commercialised money-making opportunity. However, some enterprising types have found that all this festive paraphernalia can double as lethal weapons. Civil servants were forced to take down Christmas trees in jobcentres across south-east London last year after fears that irate job-seekers would attack staff with the 4-ft high plastic evergreens. Managers also feared Christmas decorations \"might well upset people with no money\" - believed to be a reference to members of the public using jobcentres rather than staff working in them. \"I just don't see the point of decorating the office,\" says receptionist Colleen Annes, \"It just means you can't get away from Christmas at all and surely the company has better things to spend its money on than decorations. I hate the way it all starts so early too.\" Anti-Christmas feelings are not just common in the UK. Last year a group of workers in Australia found the constant office carol singing was getting a bit too much. Their complaints resulted in a union study, which found that constant exposure to piped Christmas music made them \"aggressive and confrontational\". The employees are now demanding compensation on the grounds of \"psychological terror\". It's not just malevolent trees and mindless music that can injure workers - falling decorations can activate intruder alarms, staff might fall off chairs putting up balloons, visitors could trip on light cables. The hazards are endless. But the pro-Christmas people are everjoyous, their boundless enthusiasm towards all things Christmas showing no signs of relenting. \"It's meant to be a happy time of year,\" says office manager and Xmas fan Ray Brookes. \"I don't see what's wrong with decorating my PC with tinsel and putting a tree up. Decorating the office together helps us feel more like a team and it's fun.\" His rose-tinted view is shared by colleague Michelle Dean. \"I didn't think I cared much either way either but at my old workplace, we didn't even have a tree,\" she remembers sadly. \"Sometimes I'd forget it was even Christmas time until I went outside. I really missed all the tinsel. It's much better working here - we have a massive tree in reception and some people decorate their workstations. It really gets everyone into the spirit of things.\" So, love it or hate it, Christmas is upon us and there's no escape, not even at work. And if you can't tolerate a bit of harmless tinsel, just how are you going to cope with the office party?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
