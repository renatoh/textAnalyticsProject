Comfortably beaten at home by a team they had hoped to challenge for the title, Dave Jones's side later suffered a further blow. West Bromwich's victory at Coventry moved them level on points with Wolves in the battle for second place, City having confirmed they are the division's best side thanks to two Shaun Wright-Phillips goals. A point at home against Barnsley on Saturday will bring Kevin Keegan's team their instant Premiership return. The wait is almost over. City made this meeting of the top two an uneven contest, looking much the slicker, more solid and creative. Wolves barely mustered a chance and only their goalkeeper Michael Oakes and some poor late finishing saved them from a heavier defeat. They ended with 10 men, Paul Butler being sent off near the end for two bookings. After 36 minutes the City-supporting defender had deflected in the first goal, and it was apt that his second caution followed a foul and set-to involving Darren Huckerby. The striker's pace constantly troubled Wolves, though his finishing failed to match that of Wright-Phillips. Ali Benarbia also impressed and City's defence stood firm when Wolves pressed for an equaliser after the interval. Keegan refused to discuss promotion, saying he was superstitious, but it is now a formality. One more point will not end the possibility of Wolves or West Brom finishing level with City but goal difference is such that even Keegan accepts a draw will suffice. The manager believes this team are better than the Newcastle side he took to the top flight, and one remark was telling. \"We have a chance of being with the big boys one day,\" he said. Just being in the Premiership is not enough. Wolves would settle merely for being there but were highly disappointing and their form - one win in six - suggests they will be overtaken. Their attacking lacked an element of surprise and their distribution was too often wayward. A second-half improvement had no impact in front of goal. Carlo Nash did not have a save to make, although Joleon Lescott might have done better with a free header. The wide players were largely contained and up front Nathan Blake and Dean Sturridge had minimal impact. Unlike Huckerby they offer little outside the area. If Wolves are promoted, they will need a huge injection of money from their chairman Sir Jack Hayward. City, too, will have to spend, not least on a central defender. Yet they have the basis of a good side.\"It was a real good team effort,\" Keegan said. \"We played some good football and I'm pleased that when it got physical we were able to stand up for ourselves.\" Wright-Phillips combines ceaseless energy with an ability to get forward, a quality lacking from the Wolves central midfield. Before half-time the home team failed to cope with the positions into which Bernarbia drifted between their defence and midfield. He set up Huckerby for the first of two one-on-ones that the striker wasted, though Huckerby made amends by setting up Wright-Phillips for the shot that was diverted past Oakes. His second arrived after 80 minutes when Alex Rae was robbed and Wright-Phillips finished with a fine low shot. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
