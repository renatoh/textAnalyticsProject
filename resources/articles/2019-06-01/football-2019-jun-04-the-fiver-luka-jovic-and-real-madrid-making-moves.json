Everybody loves Madrid. Just ask Spurs fans. And Gareth Bale. And Catalonia. The allure is sometimes just too much: the glory of wearing the white shirt, as Cristiano Ronaldo did, before he was booed out of town for not scoring enough goals, or something. The prestige of being embarrassed by Zinedine Zidane each day in training, bunking up with famed b@nter-merchant Sergio Ramos on away trips or being publicly shamed for having the audacity to go to bed at 11pm. Sounds like a laugh! Buena suerte, then, Luka Jovic, who was confirmed as being the latest merengue to walk the well-worn path to the Bernab\u00e9u, this time in exchange for at least \u20ac65m. Not bad business from Madrid for one of the most in-demand strikers in world football, considering today\u2019s prices, in which you normally have to waste a few zeroes just to get a whiff of The Next Big Thing\u2019s socks. \u201cIt was clear that there was a limit to what kind of bid we could refuse \u2013 for Eintracht Frankfurt this is a good and important transfer,\u201d roared former Bolton striker/current Eintracht suit Fredi Bobic, despite the sell-on small-print which dictates the German club have to punt around \u00a310m of the transfer fee over to Jovic\u2019s old side, Benfica. \u201cWe wish Luka all the best in the future. He has all the attributes to have a great career. And we are proud that we have supported him on his way. From a sporting point of view selling Luka Jovic is a big blow,\u201d continued Bobic, as the realisation of what he had done finally started to take hold. \u201cHis explosiveness and capacity to score goals propelled us into [Big Vase] and we have benefited from more than just his goals in the past two years.\u201d Madrid making moves, then, which may well put the jitters up their rivals. Sevilla have responded by naming a man \u2013 former Madrid and Spain coach Julen Lopetegui \u2013 who managed to get sacked twice in less than five months, while Atl\u00e9tico are resigned to losing Antoine Griezmann, Diego God\u00edn and Lucas Hern\u00e1ndez in the coming weeks. Thank goodness there\u2019s Barcelona, who \u2013 news just in \u2013 have an announcement of their own! Oh wait, it\u2019s just a tired-looking Philippe Coutinho at a kit launch wearing an awful shirt inspired by Ivan Rakitic\u2019s tablecloth. Roll on La Liga 2019-20, we might just have a title race on our hands. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cNo one can find out about this and no one means no one, eh. Not your friends, no one\u201d \u2013 sticking with La Liga, here\u2019s what former footballer Carlos Aranda was heard saying, according to El Mundo, in a recording relating to the alleged fixing of Valladolid\u2019s 2-0 loss to Valencia on the final day of the season. Aranda denies any wrongdoing. RECOMMENDED LOOKING It\u2019s the Liverpool, champions of Europe edition from David Squires. And you can get your hands on a printed copy too. FIVER LETTERS \u201cCan I please beg The Fiver and its readers not to mention hapless Dutch striker Philippe Hes (yesterday\u2019s News, Bits and Bobs) to Brighton\u2019s chief scout, as I fear he\u2019ll be on the first ferry from Harwich waving the chairman\u2019s golden chequebook. \u2018Our\u2019 record of buying forward players from the Eredivisie isn\u2019t too great; the last two, signed for a total in excess of \u00a330m, have between them made 45 appearances, with a combined tally of two league goals. Though perhaps the club could swap both of them for one Philippe Hes?\u201d \u2013 Tony Crawford. \u201cAs a London-born, [USA! USA!! USA!!!] citizen who has long been a fan of The Fiver\u2019s always irreverent and often humorous take on the wonderful world of football, I have to express disappointment and take umbrage at your injection of personal, partisan politics into yesterday\u2019s offering. While you are certainly entitled to be less than a fan of our democratically elected President, I really feel the viciousness of your attack delivered an unnecessary \u2013 and quite ugly \u2013 attack by association on those of us who exercised our right at the ballot box to elect Mr Trump. Perhaps the graciousness and eloquence of the President\u2019s toast to Her Majesty and his recognition of the \u2018eternal friendship\u2019 of the peoples of the United States and United Kingdom will broaden your mind to be more inclusive of differing shades of political opinion\u201d \u2013 Chris Fuller. \u201cOpen-top bus parade. Participant clearly impacted by Tin. Is J\u00fcrgen Klopp the new Freddie Flintoff and can we expect woeful primetime TV shenanigans when he decides to retire?\u201d \u2013 Alex Folkes.

NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Andy Woodward tells Daniel Taylor how a relative of Barry Bennell cast a grim shadow over his family, years before the paedophile coach began abusing him. Former England defender Laura Bassett, who made 61 appearances for her country, has announced her retirement. \u201cIt has been a privilege to play a tiny part in Lioness history and to have experienced the progression of women\u2019s football in England,\u201d she said. The Queen\u2019s Celtic are investigating a leak which allegedly revealed the club\u2019s summer transfer targets. \u201cWe\u2019re looking into it,\u201d roared a fresh and funky club suit. The next two Club World Cups will also double up as test events for the Human Rights World Cup in Qatar. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great opportunity to test the facilities. I think it hits all the marks,\u201d cheered Fifa suit Victor Montagliani. FA coffers will be bolstered by 50 million fat ones after it agreed a five-year sponsorship deal with BT. And value-for-money\u2019s Ross McCormack has been released by Aston Villa after a return of three goals in three years for the \u00a312m striker. \u201cThe club would like to wish Ross well for the future,\u201d shouted a club suit, before quickly bolting the door shut behind him and notifying Brighton\u2019s chief scout. STILL WANT MORE? Our transfer interactive is live, featuring every summer deal from Europe\u2019s top five leagues. And yes, we realise it\u2019s still officially spring so lower your guns, pedants. Our Women\u2019s World Cup 2019 team guides continue apace. Today we have No 17: Canada, and No 18: Cameroon. If England can handle Women\u2019s World Cup expectations they can capture the country\u2019s heart, writes Eni Aluko. Netherlands boss Ronald Koeman chews the fat with Ed Aarons about facing England, the young talent at his disposal and that World Cup qualifier in 1993.
