The company said it expected its 79-shop UK chain and online business, which lost \u00a336.3m last year, to be wound down by administrators as it had become clear it could not return to profitability. The administration will not include Mothercare\u2019s profitable overseas operations, which have more than 1,000 stores in over 40 countries. The company, which opened its first store in 1961, said the UK administration filing \u2013 which is expected as soon as Tuesday \u2013 was a \u201cnecessary step in the restructuring and refinancing of the group\u201d after failing to find a buyer. Mothercare\u2019s closure is the latest blow to the UK retail industry after a tough two years which has left more than 7,500 additional shops empty. Well-known names including Karen Millen, Bonmarch\u00e9 and Supercuts have all called in administrators in recent months. Others, including Debenhams, Monsoon and Arcadia Group, have used an insolvency procedure known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) to close shops and cut jobs. Mothercare, whose chief executive Mark Newton-Jones left in April last year only to return a month later, has struggled to compete with supermarkets, online retailers and general retailers such as Marks &amp; Spencer, Debenhams and Boots. Shoppers outside the group\u2019s Wood Green store in north London on Monday said they would be sad to see Mothercare go. But several said it was more expensive and less convenient than buying from supermarkets, Primark or Amazon. \u201cWhen you can get good quality stuff from Asda or Tesco why bother going to Mothercare? It\u2019s the same items and paying \u00a320 [for some babywear] doesn\u2019t make sense when they are only going to wear it for three months,\u201d said one mother of three pushing her pram past the Wood Green store. Victoria Logan, a shopper with a baby in a pram, said: \u201cI was a bit surprised to hear about the administration. There won\u2019t be that many places to go to any more if you want things like car seats.\u201d But she admitted that she bought a lot online as she was signed up to Amazon\u2019s Prime subscription service which includes free deliveries. \u201cIt\u2019s so useful as it just comes the next day,\u201d she said. Founded by Selim Zilkha and Sir James Goldsmith, Mothercare has been listed on the London stock exchange since 1972. Ten years later it merged with Habitat and then British Home Stores to form Storehouse, but the group was broken up in 2000 when BHS was sold to Sir Philip Green. After acquiring the Early Learning Centre toy business in 2007, Mothercare had more than 400 stores in the UK. But the chain has gradually been downsizing since then and cut 60 stores last year, through a CVA to take the total to less than 80. Earlier this year it sold off the Early Learning Centre toy brand in an attempt to keep the UK business afloat. Richard Lim, chief executive of the Retail Economics consultancy, said: \u201cThis is perhaps one of the most highly anticipated collapses on the high street. The retailer was already on life support, having conducted a CVA last year. The cost-cutting operation and disposal of assets have not gone far enough to revive plummeting profits. \u201cYears of underinvestment in the online business and its inability to differentiate itself as a specialist for young families and expectant parents has been the root of its seemingly inevitable downfall. As competition has become fiercer they have been beaten on price, convenience and the overall customer experience.\u201d Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, said: \u201cMothercare disappearing from our high streets would be a huge loss to the new parents who rely on it and the thousands of workers whose jobs are at risk. \u201cThe government must urgently meet with unions and the company to safeguard these jobs. Under the Conservatives, our high streets continue to suffer. They are at the heart of our communities and desperately need saving. Labour\u2019s five-point plan will rejuvenate Britain\u2019s town centres and protect jobs.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
