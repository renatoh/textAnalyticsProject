Vishambar Mehrotra told the Guardian that if the police had covered up the links between his son\u2019s abduction and killing in 1981, and the activities of paedophiles at a guest house in south-west London that is now at the centre of a new police inquiry into murders of children, they should be working even harder to bring the killers to justice today. Mehrotra\u2019s son, Vishal, went missing in July 1981 in Putney, less than a mile from the Elm House guest house in Rock Lane, Barnes, while on his way home with his family from watching the wedding of the Prince of Wales and Diana Spencer. He had been walking slightly ahead of his family in the crowded streets where revellers were celebrating. Seven months later the upper half of his torso was found buried in woodland in West Sussex. Mehrotra, a retired magistrate, said he was contacted by a man in his twenties a few months after his son\u2019s disappearance who suggested the boy\u2019s abduction might be connected to the activities of a group of \u201cpowerful, high-profile\u201d paedophiles who frequented the guest house. He taped the phone call and passed it onto detectives investigating his son\u2019s abduction, but was told it was probably a crank call, and the information was never followed up. The man said he had already informed the police of the activities of politicians, judges and other high-profile individuals abusing boys at the guest house, but had not been contacted again. Last Friday, the Metropolitan police announced they had opened an investigation into possible homicide after receiving allegations that children had been killed by paedophiles linked to the establishment who were operating more than 30 years ago at Elm House and at Dolphin Square. Dolphin Square has long been a popular residence for politicians. Mehrotra believes the new inquiry should be looking at the unsolved killing of his son, but he has heard nothing from Scotland Yard detectives involved in the inquiry. \u201cAfter 30 years the police are still failing to find the person responsible for my son\u2019s death,\u201d he said. \u201cI have come to the conclusion that maybe, for whatever reason, they have not really done their homework. If high-profile people were involved this must be exposed, if there was a cover-up I need to know. There was information passed to me which I gave the police at the time, but it was never looked at and the trail went cold. I taped the whole conversation and gave a copy to the police. They just dismissed it, said it was probably a crank call. If the police have any sympathy for us as a family, for what we have been through and are still going through, they should be in touch with me now to tell me that this has come to light, they need to be looking at my son\u2019s case in connection with this. I have not heard from them on this, I have not heard from them for years and years. A detective contacted me 10 years or so after my son\u2019s death to say he was going to look at it again, to reinvestigate. Then nothing. It all went quiet.\u201d The Metropolitan police have refused to discuss the ongoing investigation into possible homicide linked to paedophiles with establishment connections more than 30 years ago. But a source close to the homicide investigations unit said the first place officers would begin to look was the database on child murders \u2013 Catchem (Centralised Analytical Team Collating Homicide Expertise) \u2013 to examine whether any unsolved child homicides have any previously unseen links to the new information. Vishal\u2019s case is featured on this database, and the close proximity to one of the establishments being looked at by police should highlight it as a high-profile case to examine, the investigative source said. Vishal\u2019s murder was linked at the time by detectives to the activities of Sidney Cooke, who was a member of a paedophile ring that was eventually brought to justice for the rape and murder of three boys, but is suspected of having abducted and killed several more. The activities of the paedophile ring were investigated in a major inquiry known as Operation Orchid, which examined the fate of a number of missing children going back to 1980 after receiving intelligence that Cooke\u2019s gang could have abducted and killed up to 20 children. The Guardian can reveal that intelligence linking a member of Cooke\u2019s gang, Lennie Smith, to the Elm House guest house came into the Orchid inquiry, but was never followed up. Roger Stoodley, the retired detective chief superintendent who ran the inquiry, said on Wednesday: \u201cLennie Smith, one of the leading lights of the gang, had been a rent boy in the West End and we believed that he had visited the Elm guest house. It certainly was something that was in the intelligence file relating to this gang. But we had massive amounts of information, we had whole rooms full of information and intelligence to go through. We didn\u2019t look at Elm House because it wasn\u2019t what we thought was relevant at the time to what we were doing. We heard rumours that something was going on there, but we were focused on the work we were doing.\u201d Stoodley said as part of his investigation he trawled missing-person reports from forces all over the country. \u201cIt was all a bloody mess,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery force had its own way of recording things, if a boy had gone missing a few times they wouldn\u2019t even report it, and sometimes they would have a missing-person report and it was never followed up.\u201d Stoodley said all the information from Operation Orchid should be within Scotland Yard. But a senior detective who tried to review the Operation Orchid files into paedophiles in 1998 found that the intelligence had not only been left without analysis, it had been lost. DS Ed Williams, now retired, said at the time that nearly a third of sex-offender files for one of London\u2019s eight police areas were nowhere to be found. Scotland Yard\u2019s intelligence unit, which is supposed to collate intelligence on all sex attacks, was staffed by only one officer and one secretary. The Guardian asked the Metropolitan police on Wednesday for the whereabouts of the Orchid files, but they refused to comment. They also refused to comment on whether they were examining Vishal\u2019s murder as part of their new inquiry."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
