Downing Street indicated on Monday that it would not allow a 50-page dossier from the intelligence and security committee to be published before the election, prompting a string of complaints over its suppression. The committee\u2019s chairman, Dominic Grieve, called the decision \u201cjaw dropping\u201d, saying no reason for the refusal had been given, while Labour and Scottish National party politicians accused No 10 of refusing to recognise the scale of Russian meddling. Fresh evidence has also emerged of attempts by the Kremlin to infiltrate the Conservatives by a senior Russian diplomat suspected of espionage, who spent five years in London cultivating leading Tories including Johnson himself. It can now be revealed that Sergey Nalobin \u2013 who once described the future prime minister as \u201cour good friend\u201d \u2013 lives in a Moscow apartment block known as the \u201cFSB house\u201d because it houses so many employees from the Kremlin\u2019s main spy agency. The committee\u2019s report is based on analysis from Britain\u2019s intelligence agencies, as well as third-party experts such as the former MI6 officer Christopher Steele, and is subject to a final clearance from Downing Street. That has to come before parliament is dissolved on Tuesday if it is to be released ahead of the election. Downing Street sources stated that was not now expected to happen in time, claiming the sign-off process typically takes six weeks. A No 10 spokesman added: \u201cThere are processes reports such as this have to go through before publication, and the committee is well-informed of these.\u201d However, it is understood the dossier has already been approved by the intelligence agencies themselves as part of a long clearance process that began in late March. Downing Street was sent a final draft on 17 October and had been expected to sign off the report by the end of last week. Grieve said: \u201cThe protocols are quite clear. If the prime minister has a good reason for preventing publication he should explain to the committee what it is, and do it within 10 days of him receiving the report. If not, it should be published.\u201d The dossier specifically examines Russian attempts to interfere in the 2016 EU referendum. Members of the committee \u2013 which meets in secret because of the sensitivity of its work \u2013 had wanted to make recommendations to introduce greater safeguards ahead of the December poll. Ian Lucas, a Labour MP who sits on the culture media and sport select committee, which has conducted related inquiries into the conduct of the EU referendum said \u201cthe government needs to come clean about its view on Russian interference in British politics\u201d. Ministers have argued that there are no examples of successful Russian interference in UK elections, but Lucas said that this needed to be properly tested: \u201cThis decision looks like it is designed to avoid proper scrutiny of what we actually know.\u201d Allegations that Moscow money has flowed into the Conservative party via emigres living in the UK making high-profile donations, were also heard by the committee \u2013 although the party has consistently denied receiving money improperly. In 2014, Lubov Chernukhin \u2013 the wife of the former Russian deputy finance minister \u2013 paid \u00a3160,000 to play tennis with Johnson and David Cameron. The match was the star lot at a Conservative summer party auction. Another guest at the 2013 fundraiser was Vasily Shestakov, Vladimir Putin\u2019s judo partner. Committee members were also briefed on an extraordinary \u2013 and for a while an apparently successful \u2013 attempt to penetrate Conservative circles by Nalobin, who instigated a pro-Kremlin parliamentary group, the Conservative Friends of Russia. During his time in the UK, Nalobin went to exclusive Tory fundraising events and met senior Conservatives. In January 2014 he posed for a photograph with Johnson at an event at city hall in London. Nalobin posted it on Twitter, writing in a caption that the then mayor was \u201cour good friend\u201d who said \u201cwarm words\u201d about Russians. Conservative Friends of Russia held its 2012 launch party in the Russian ambassador\u2019s Kensington garden, with about 250 Russian and British guests present, including Tories who went on to play a prominent role in the referendum campaign. One was Matthew Elliott, now chief executive of pro-Brexit group Vote Leave, alongside Dominic Cummings, now the prime minister\u2019s chief strategist. Another guest was Johnson\u2019s future girlfriend Carrie Symonds, a Tory party activist. At the time she worked in the office of John Whittingdale, the pro-Brexit MP who was the group\u2019s honorary vice-president. The group collapsed after revelations of Nalobin\u2019s alleged ties with the Kremlin\u2019s SVR foreign intelligence agency. Over the weekend, the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, raised questions over Cummings\u2019 connections to Russia, and the levels of security vetting to which he had been subject, after an official whistleblower raised concerns with her. Thornberry asked if Cummings had been asked about his relationship with members of Conservative Friends of Russia, as well as the purpose of his three-year period of work in post-communist Russia between 1994 and 1997. The Guardian\u2019s investigation was carried out with the The Insider, an independent Russian news website. Property records show that Nalobin owns an apartment at Michurinskiy Prospect 27, in south-west Moscow. The block\u2019s ties with state spying are so well established that sellers are able to advertise their properties in the \u201cFSB house\u201d at above market rates. Peers held a special debate about the withheld dossier, after an urgent question from the cross-bench peer David Anderson, a national security expert, who insisted the delay was unjustified. \u201cIt invites, I\u2019m afraid, suspicion of the government and its motives,\u201d he said. Earl Howe, responding for the government, told peers: \u201cThe length of time that the government had had for this report is not at all unusual. It was delivered on 17 October \u2013 that is not a very long time ago. And the prime minister is entitled to take his view on what the report contains.\u201d Stewart McDonald, the SNP\u2019s defence spokesman, said: \u201cParliament is about to be sent packing into a general election without fully understanding the extent to which Russia has meddled in our most recent democratic electoral events.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
