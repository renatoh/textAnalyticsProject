Under an agreement between the Welsh Rugby Union and its four regions, the 29-year-old Webb is an outcast at international level after turning down the opportunity to remain in Wales and joining Toulon in the summer. Webb\u2019s half-back partner at Ospreys last season, Dan Biggar, is available to the Wales head coach, Gatland, despite joining Northampton because he meets the threshold of 60 caps for players who have turned down a regional contract and moved abroad. \u201cI feel very sorry for Rhys,\u201d said Gatland, who is in the final year of his contract with Wales having started at the end of 2007. \u201cI would love the opportunity to be able to pick him but the rules say I can\u2019t. I would like to think that, if we have injuries at scrum-half, common sense will prevail. \u201cThe pleasing thing is that the rugby management board, which includes the four head coaches of the regions, meets once a month. They understand what the position is and I don\u2019t think anyone wants a see a team hampered by not being able to pick the best player. \u201cWe will see what happens over the next six months. If Rhys\u2019s form is good enough and seeing what happens with the other scrum-halves, is there a possibility? At the moment it is a firm no but you can never say never. \u201cThere is no doubt that when Rhys is fit and playing well, he is world-class. We will let the dust settle on it and, when we get a bit closer to the World Cup, it might be a possibility. It could make a difference to us, having someone like him available.\u201d Webb, who missed Toulon\u2019s weekend victory against Agen because of injury, hopes dispensation can be made. \u201cI have not given up on the dream of representing my country again,\u201d he said. \u201cI just want to play as well as I can and become the best number nine in the world, so it will be hard not to pick me.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
