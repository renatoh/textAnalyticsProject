But once the result was official, congratulations came pouring in from around the world. Donald Trump\u2019s allies, critics and reluctant partners had all been following the vote counting, weighing up the impact of a radical change of direction expected from Washington under Biden. Many of those congratulating the new president-elect and his running mate Kamala Harris took the opportunity to bolster ties by underlining their connection to America. Among the first was Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau. He said: \u201cWe share a relationship that\u2019s unique on the world stage. I\u2019m really looking forward to working together and building on that with you both.\u201d A notable exception to the parade of well-wishers came from the United States\u2019 southern neighbour, where Mexico\u2019s president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, said he could not congratulate a winner until all legal proceedings are concluded, calling his decision \u201cpolitically prudent\u201d. In his remarks, L\u00f3pez Obrador said he had a good relationship with both Trump and with former vice president Biden, who he said he had known for a decade. Boris Johnson, who has been a close ally of Trump, took a little longer, but about an hour after the election was called put out a message reminding Biden of the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d that usually means so much more to London than Washington. He said: \u201cAmerica is our closest ally and I look forward to working closely together on our shared priorities.\u201d From Dublin the congratulations came with a nod to Biden\u2019s Irish heritage, with his interest in the country particularly important at a time of fears that the Good Friday agreement could be threatened by Brexit. \u201cI want to congratulate the new president elect of the US. Joe Biden has been a true friend of this nation throughout his life and I look forward to working with him in the years ahead,\u201d wrote the Irish prime minister Miche\u00e1l Martin. The stream of global congratulations were in stark contrast to the middle of the week, when the US slid into days of election chaos, with a flailing incumbent making wildly untrue claims from the White House as his supporters gathered in the streets to demand the basis of democracy \u2013 counting votes \u2013 be halted. That had prompted mockery from around the world. But after a brief wobble, American democracy appeared to have come through. And after years in which Trump has disengaged from multilateral institutions, to focus on his \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy, many are likely to be hoping for greater global engagement under a Biden administration. Spain\u2019s prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez and France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron both said they were looking forward to future cooperation. The leaders of Greece and Italy added their congratulations, while the head of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, described Biden as a \u201cstrong supporter of our alliance\u201d. The president of Ukraine, whose country was central to Trump\u2019s impeachment and an attempt by the Trump campaign to paint Biden and his family as corrupt, offered speedy congratulations. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who often seemed frustrated by Trump \u2013 reportedly telling Macron this summer \u201cI don\u2019t want to be in the room with the guy\u201d \u2013 said via a spokesman that she wished Biden \u201cluck and success from the bottom of my heart\u201d. There were also celebrations around the world of Harris\u2019s historic success as the first woman on a winning presidential ticket, and the first woman of colour to become vice-president. The first minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, said: \u201cThis is a big and special moment. Women and people of colour in particular will feel inspired by the historic nature of vice-president elect Harris\u2019s achievement.\u201d Many of Trump\u2019s closest allies abroad \u2013 and his most bitter rivals \u2013 began repositioning themselves after Biden\u2019s win. India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, a Trump ally who critics said had tacitly endorsed the incumbent for re-election, sent congratulations and a particular message for Harris, whose mother moved to the US from India. He said: \u201cYour success is pathbreaking, and a matter of immense pride for all Indian-Americans. I am confident vibrant India-US ties will get even stronger with your support and leadership.\u201d Iran\u2019s supreme leader, the ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was quick to repeat earlier mockery of the election, which he described as \u201ca spectacle\u201d but did not attack the president-elect personally, and on Saturday evening a political prisoner, Nasrin Sotoudeh, was given a temporary release from jail. The timing may have been a coincidence, but there are hopes Biden and Tehran may revive the Obama-era nuclear deal jettisoned by Trump. News of the release also fostered hopes a Biden administration would be focused on civil rights beyond America\u2019s borders, as well as at home. \u201cThere is doom and gloom within Arab regime circles,\u201d said Hassan Hassan, editor of Newslines Magazine. \u201cA Biden presidency is likely to create space for activists and renewed civil society support.\u201d Iraq\u2019s president, Barham Saleh. extended \u201cwarmest congratulations\u201d to Biden, describing him as \u201ca friend and trusted partner in the cause of building a better Iraq. We look forward to working to achieve our common goals and strengthening peace and stability in the entire Middle East.\u201d Japan\u2019s prime minister Yoshihide Suga, meanwhile, congratulated Biden and pledged to work together to ensure \u201cpeace, freedom and prosperity\u201d in an Indo-Pacific region that is increasingly dominated by China. South Korean president Moon Jae-in said he was looking forward to working with Biden on their \u201cshared values\u201d. Australia\u2019s conservative prime minister, Scott Morrison, congratulated Biden on his victory , while his predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull, succinctly declared \u201cwhat a relief\u201d. Morrison said he looked forward to coordinating with the new Biden administration on Covid-19 and on technologies to reduce \u201cglobal\u201d emissions. In his congratulations, Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari, leader of Africa\u2019s most populous nation, called for \u201cgreater engagement\u201d with the continent, while South African president Cyril Ramaphosa said on Twitter his government looked forward to \u201cworking with you and deepening our bonds of friendship and cooperation\u201d. From Brazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro, one of Trump\u2019s most fervent backers, there has been silence. There was also no immediate statement from Russian president Vladimir Putin. The election\u2019s outcome inspired disbelief in Slovenia, the homeland of first lady Melania Trump. Prime minister Janez Jansa was the only world leader who congratulated Trump even before all the votes were counted, and continued to show support after Biden\u2019s win was announced. One ousted leader had a word of advice to the outgoing president. Former Danish prime minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen tweeted to Trump a picture of himself walking out of the seat of power, a backpack over his shoulder, and said: \u201cThis is the right way to leave office with honour once you have lost an election. Thanks for honest conversations over the last four years. Let\u2019s keep in touch.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 7 November 2020 because an earlier version said that Harris is \u201cthe first person of colour to become vice-president\u201d. That should have said the first woman of colour. With agencies"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
