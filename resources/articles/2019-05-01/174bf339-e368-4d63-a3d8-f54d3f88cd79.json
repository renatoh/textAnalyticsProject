Scrabble rule change allows use of 'OK'", "bodyText": "Hold on to your tiles: the first new Scrabble words in four years are being added to the official list of accepted words, including \u2013 heretically for some purists \u2013 the two-letter word \u201cOK\u201d. The new edition of Collins Official Scrabble Words adds 2,862 words to the existing 276,000, allowing players who have pored over the new list to rack up an impressive 20 points if they manage to put down \u201cyowza\u201d, 22 if they can fit \u201cgenderqueer\u201d anywhere, or 12 for \u201cfleek\u201d. OK is one of three new two-letter words, the first added to the official list since 2007. The others are \u201cew\u201d \u2013 an \u201cexpression of disgust\u201d joining eew and eeew in the dictionary \u2013 and \u201cze\u201d, defined as a gender-neutral pronoun. The dictionary is approved for all English-language play outside the US and is compiled using the language database of the Collins Corpus. Four-time national Scrabble champion Philip Nelkon welcomed the addition of new two-letter words, calling them the \u201clifeblood of high-score Scrabble, enabling us to make those high-scoring parallel plays involving many words\u201d. However, he said that OK was a controversial choice among players, as according to the official rules, it should not be allowed due to being both capitalised and an abbreviation. The OED gives its origin as the mid-19th century, and says it is probably an abbreviation of \u201corl korrect\u201d, a humorous form of \u201call correct\u201d, which was popularised as a slogan during President Van Buren\u2019s re-election campaign of 1840 in the US: \u201chis nickname Old Kinderhook (derived from his birthplace) provided the initials.\u201d Collins language content consultant Helen Newstead said that OK is considered \u201ca noun, a verb, an adjective, and an adverb. No one thinks of it as an initialism anymore.\u201d Brett Smitheram, who describes Scrabble as \u201cadrenaline sport\u201d and won the 2016 Scrabble World Championship with words including the 176-pointer \u201cbraconid\u201d, meaning a parasitic wasp, said the inclusion would be \u201cone of the most impactful changes\u201d to the game, because it ends with \u201cK\u201d. \u201cIt used to be that if you put a K down, you knew your opponent couldn\u2019t play across the top of it \u2013 it will be a change of mindset,\u201d he said. He predicted the inclusion would outrage some fans, but \u201cthat\u2019s the joy of it\u201d. \u201cOK is no longer associated with being an acronym and has become lexicalised as a term in its own right. Compare it with IQ, which many still realise stands for \u2018intelligence quotient\u2019 \u2026 would you know what OK stands for outside of its meaning as a standalone word?\u201d said Smitheram. \u201cIts inclusion has caused discussion, both strategically and lexicographically. But it\u2019s like octopi, which is listed in the dictionary as \u2018not the plural of octopus\u2019. It is in common enough use that it\u2019s worthy of note \u2013 and that\u2019s the case with OK.\u201d OK only brings six points with it, but new words using Z and X, such as dox, vax and zen, will be more useful to players. Smitheram predicted that competitive players will be \u201cswotting up\u201d the new list of words, as it will be adopted into competitive Scrabble from July. \u201cIf they don\u2019t know they can use ze or bingeable and their opponent does, they might miss a trick,\u201d he said. Scrabble was dreamed up in the 1930s by out-of-work American architect Alfred Mosher Butts, who wanted to create a word game with scoring. According to legend, he used the front page of the New York Times to make his calculations for letter distribution. Turned down by established games manufacturers, he teamed up with games entrepreneur James Brunot and together they came up with the name Scrabble . According to toy company Hasbro, they started out by stamping letters on wooden tiles one at a time, turning out 12 games an hour. By the early 1950s, Scrabble had taken off. According to Hasbro, it can be found in three of every five US homes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
