The suit, filed in Nantucket superior court on Wednesday, seeks a jury trial to award undisclosed financial damages over the alleged incident in the establishment on the island off the coast of Cape Cod. Spacey, 59, already faces a criminal charge for the alleged incident, for which he appeared in court earlier in June. He has pleaded not guilty to a charge of indecent assault and battery and his lawyers said the allegations were \u201cpatently false\u201d. If convicted for the criminal charges, he could face up to two and a half years in jail. The civil complaint this week asserts that Spacey bought the plaintiff \u201cmultiple alcoholic beverages\u201d in the bar area of the Nantucket restaurant where he worked after they were introduced to one another. In the early morning of 8 July 2016, the suit claims: \u201cDefendant Kevin Spacey Fowler, without the plaintiff\u2019s consent, sexually assaulted the plaintiff by, among other things, defendant Kevin Spacey Fowler touching and fondling the plaintiff\u2019s private areas, including the plaintiff\u2019s genitals.\u201d The suit, signed by the anonymous man\u2019s lawyer, Mitchell Garabedian, accuses Spacey of \u201cexplicit sexual behaviour and lewd and lascivious conduct with the plaintiff\u201d at the Club Car restaurant in Nantucket. As a result of Spacey\u2019s alleged behaviour, the plaintiff \u201csuffers, has suffered and will continue to suffer in the future severe mental distress and emotional injuries\u201d, states the suit. It also claims he suffered \u201cfinancial expenses for medical and therapeutic care and treatment; long-term lost earning capacity; as well as other damages\u201d. By engaging in the alleged behaviour, Spacey \u201cacted intentionally so as to cause harmful and offensive contact with the plaintiff\u201d, claims the suit. The suit demands judgment against Spacey for each of the claims listed \u201cin an amount to be determined by a jury, plus costs, interest, attorneys\u2019 fees and such other and further relief as the court deems just and equitable\u201d. The allegations first emerged after former Boston TV anchor Heather Unruh claimed the actor got her son drunk and sexually assaulted him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
