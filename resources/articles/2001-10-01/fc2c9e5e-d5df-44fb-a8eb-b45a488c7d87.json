It's a stomach-turning prospect, as Dubuffet's thoughts exhibited a markedly lavatorial bent. Indeed, the artist often described his work as if it were the output of his stomach. His critical writings are loaded with references to \"ingestion\" and \"secretion\", and here we are invited to make an ascent through the intestinal tunnel of his final project, the giant upended turd of the Tour aux Figures that stands 24 metres high on the outskirts of Paris. There are examples of the tower at various stages of its inception, charting the manner in which Dubuffet's world view inflated to monumental proportions. These are scribbles aspiring to the condition of sculpture: Dubuffet's unique gift was that of doodling in three dimensions. Moulded out of white epoxy resin, laced with the artist's signature felt-pen swirls and cross-hatching, the models appear, en masse, like an ideal-home exhibition for the surface of the moon, or the product of a graffiti artist gone mad at the centre of a salt mine. Part architecture, part sculpture, and partly what looks like an attempt to grow giant mutant vegetables, these tuberous forms are moulded from the primal, plastic gloop that formed the essence of the Dubuffian universe. The wonder is that he actually succeeded. Many of the projects that were eventually realised are more bizarre than those that remained purely conjectural. Dubuffet embodied the paradox of the virulently anti-establishment artist who had large corporations queuing up to put one of his great globs of disdain on their forecourt. The nine-metre Monument la B\u00eate Debout stands proudly outside a bank in Chicago like a mouldering hunk of emmenthal cheese. And with the immense Jardin d'Hiver on permanent display at the Pompidou Centre in Paris, you can appreciate the wendy-house version here. One of the benefits of the exhibition is that it enables you to flit between major public spaces in Chicago, Paris and New York without the risk of air travel. But when art needs to go to the toilet for inspiration, the writing is on the wall. Until January 6. Details: 0113-247 8248."}, "isHosted": false}}}
