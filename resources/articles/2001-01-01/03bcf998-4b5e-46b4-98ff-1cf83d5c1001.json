The break did them the world of good last January and on this occasion there would not be the tiresome business of having to feign interest in the Fifa World Club Championship. United might just as well fly off to Rio again. Come snow or high water their lead in the Premiership would be safe in their absence and Sir Alex Ferguson's third team would probably be quite capable of beating Fulham in the FA Cup next Sunday. A year ago United left the country two points behind Leeds, yet still won the title by 18. By tonight Sir Alex Ferguson's team could be 11 points ahead since a defeat for Arsenal at Charlton this afternoon appears more likely than West Ham winning at Old Trafford this evening. Certainly the media could do with a change. The hacks had a whale of a time with Fergie and his boys in Brazil, what with bust-ups on and off the field, David Beckham's sending-off and the metamorphosis of Gary Neville from a calm, competent defender to an angst-ridden cock-up artist - an image which still haunts him. When one team monopolises a league the way United are doing and will continue to do for some time yet, there is a limit to the stock of critical praise available. A point is being reached when it would be correct to say that no team, not even Liverpool at their peak, have ever set and sustained such high levels of performance as those now being achieved at Old Trafford. But endlessly repeated success can become as monotonous as a limitless failure. The problem lies not with United but with the apparent inability of any other side to keep up with them for any length of time. When the manager of the team lying third in the Premiership can declare, midway through a season, that he is 90% sure his side will not be relegated then clearly the league is in desperate need of a more serious contest. George Burley may be forgiven his caution. Ipswich gave one of their best performances of the season in beating Tottenham 3-0 at Portman Road on Saturday but Burley knows how easily a bad month can change things. Although his excellent side may go second today if they win at Sunderland, their manager's modest aim of finishing as high as possible is realistic enough for a newly promoted club. This is not the early 60s, when an Ipswich team cobbled together by Alf Ramsey could win the Second and First Division titles in successive seasons. Yet if the present low-budget Ipswich side can win a place in Europe that would be a comparable achievement, given the plutocratic nature of the modern game. This season, as last, the biggest disappointment has been the inability of more likely challengers for United's title to come remotely close to maintaining the sort of winning run necessary to bring a bead or two of perspiration to Old Trafford's brow. The holiday programme has become a microcosm of the failure of the Premiership's other big clubs to make a better contest of the championship. Arsenal, generally reckoned to be the side most likely to deny United their first league hat-trick, began by losing 4-0 at Liverpool, then atoned for this misdeed by whacking aspiring Leicester City 6-1, only to throw away a 2-0 lead against Sunderland in Saturday's 2-2 draw at Highbury. When, after losing 1-0 at the Stadium of Light on the opening day, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's team won eight of their next 12 Premiership fixtures and drew the others the race seemed to be on. Then Arsenal lost 2-0 at Goodison to Everton's walking wounded, and since then on occasions the desire has simply drained away from their football. Emmanuel Petit could be a pain but his passion was never in doubt and, though Gilles Grimandi has partly restored the balance in midfield after Petit's departure to Barcelona, this has always looked a case of replacing the dash of Marshal Ney with the swagger of Marshal Murat. Beyond Arsenal, with Leeds's title ambitions hamstrung by injuries, Liverpool have looked a serious championship alternative but only in glimpses. By ending United's two-year-old unbeaten home league record and then putting four past Arsenal, G\u00e9rard Houllier's team suggested they might make a break for it in the new year, as Liverpool sides of the past used to do. But a 1-0 Boxing Day defeat at Middlesbrough followed by Saturday's postponement at Bradford City has left Liverpool back in the pack. So far as the championship goes, then, it looks like being a case of continuing to wait for United to grow old while others search for something to replace them. In the shorter term Ferguson's side will just tick over at the top while they prepare to resume the pursuit of further glory in the Champions League with two games against Valencia next month. For Arsenal, assuring themselves of a place in next season's Champions League while making a decent show in this season's tournament must be the main aim. Meanwhile Leeds, whose performances in the Champions League have most captured the English imagination, for all their big spending face the uncomfortable truth that, with the prospect of a place in the top three of the Premiership now remote, they will have to win the European Cup to stay in it. For the fair-to-middling mid-tablers the new year offers mixed promises. Newcastle United, another injury-hit side, are responding well to Bobby Robson's powers of motivation and West Ham have proved as good as Harry Redknapp's word in their upward surge. But Aston Villa had better start winning rather than drawing if John Gregory is to escape the wrath of Doug Ellis, for whom an apology for public criticism is never going to be enough, and if Claudio Ranieri's English does not show a similar improvement what remains of Chelsea's season will be lost in the translation. And what price a Manchester derby next season? City punters would like to know."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
