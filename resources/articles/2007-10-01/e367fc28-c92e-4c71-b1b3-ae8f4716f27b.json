Since then they have simply carried on, helped by a certain soup commercial that massively boosted their sales in the 1990s. Both are referred to in the slick display of illuminated posters and album covers that form the backdrop on their latest and longest - with 34 dates - UK tour. The secret of their success is making gradual changes while sticking to what they do best - glorious unaccompanied Zulu harmony vocals that combine hymns, traditional material and the powerful songwriting of their leader, Joseph Shabalala, who started Ladysmith in the 1960s. To this, they have added slick dance moves, audience participation and comedy routines that are now less of an embarrassment than in the past. This time round, the most interesting change involves the great Shabalala himself. He is still in fine voice, and joins the high-kicking Zulu workouts, but no longer dominates all the announcements and solos. The nine-man lineup includes four of his sons, and the youngest, Thamsanqa Shabalala, proves a rousing lead singer. A second innovation involves the powerful, political, singer-songwriter Vusi Mahlasela. He opened the evening with an impressive solo set, showing off his remarkable vocal range, and later joined Ladysmith for his own Heaven in My Heart, on which he played guitar, and for the rousing finale of Shosholoza. On this showing, Ladysmith will be able to continue when Joseph Shabalala retires, but it will be hard to match his songwriting - the most spine-tingling moment of the night came with the 80s classic Homeless, which he co-wrote with Paul Simon. \u00b7 At the Assembly Theatre, Tunbridge Wells, tomorrow (01892 530613). Then touring."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
