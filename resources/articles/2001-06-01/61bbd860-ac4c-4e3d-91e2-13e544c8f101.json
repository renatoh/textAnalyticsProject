Not just a passing glance, but a really serious inspection? It's been a while, admit it. Well, legend suggests that it was Mr Billy Goat, or possibly his rapscallion son Billy the Kid, that first felt the force of a double-shot latte. So next time you order one, just remember the following Very Important Story. According to the fable of the Dancing Goats, man first discovered the stimulating effects of coffee when he saw his herd munching cherries from a strange tree and frolicking friskily about the park. Eager to join in the fun, the duty goatherd tried the cherries himself, and boiled them up into a nicely sculpted cappuccino. Seconds later, he had donned pinstripes, bought a Ferrari and made a killing on the stock exchange. Well, that last bit isn't in the fable, but it is (more or less) the argument advanced by Stewart Lee Allen in his new book, The Devil's Cup (Canongate, \u00a312.99). If you are wondering why this odd tale is so important, consider the value of coffee to our dreary, office-bound existences. Not for nothing is coffee the world's second most traded commodity. And if you follow Allen's argument, coffee is more than just a mid-morning pick-me-up, more in fact than merely a product that involves the employment of 25m people, more even than the world's most popular drink. Coffee is \"the driving force in history\". If coffee replaced beer as the beverage of choice, sobering up a load of drunken medieval shepherds and turning them into investment bankers, as Allen suggests, then we office workers must function much better caffeinated than we do decaffeinated. \"Oh God no! I couldn't live without coffee - it's the early morning job-start,\" says Tariq, who works in a publishing office. \"I'm always sceptical of people who don't drink coffee, like men who wear leather trousers, or have a beard but no moustache,\" he explains, helpfully. In the past five or so years, the global craze for quality coffee has been \"the driving force\" in the daily lives of millions of office staff (the leather-trousered excepted). Pablo Dubois, director of operations at the International Coffee Organisation, suggests it is partly because gourmet coffee's American promoters in the early 1980s targeted office workers and college students, and partly because the drink is hardly a drink at all and more like a meal, really. \"It's a beverage that has some substance, so it feels like you have actually consumed something substantial, but it is not intoxicating,\" he says, adding: \"It keeps people alert, it's very flexible and can be consumed rapidly.\" I'll say. Like many of my fellow addicts, I can knock back a measure of thick, dark espresso faster than you can say, \"A tall skinny layered latte with a double shot of hazelnut, no foam and extra cinnamon, please\". Pretty fast, huh? Still, it keeps me going until lunchtime. \"You can overdo it,\" Dubois says of coffee's stimulant effect, \"but when you consume it in reasonable quantities it's fine!\" Bosses and managers, unless they are running Starbucks, have been sceptical about the value of coffee breaks and most do not encourage their staff to pop out for a cuppa \"five or six\" times a day. Thankfully, though, bids to impose order on caffeinated workers have generally ended in failure, following a popular revolt. According to the Complete Guide to Coffee (Lorenz Books, \u00a37.95), one petty-minded little single-shot of a middle manager, King Charles II, feared too much caffeine would result in political unrest and closed all the coffee houses in 1675. The women of London had complained that coffee had an effect similar to brewer's droop, which we'll call barista's droop, on their chaps. But the ban was unworkable and was lifted after the boys replied that it was actually the ladies, not the lattes, that made them \"less active in the sports of Venus\". In Tariq's office, \"coffee\" has become shorthand for workers' solidarity. The Coffee Collective that has developed there operates a very strict kitty system where the Chief Coffee Comrade collects \u00a33 \"voluntary contributions\" that are then used to buy communal coffee rounds. Woe betide anyone who dares to opt for mineral water or, worse, sneaks off to Costa on a \"solo\" run. Looked at in a certain, wired kind of way, coffee drinking even brought about the birth of modern democracy. The first ballot box was introduced into a coffee house in 18th-century London so that regulars could air their views on the day's hot topics without having hot liquid thrown all over them by rivals. The office despots of the 21st century seem finally to be embracing this democratic spirit. It has even dawned on some managers that precious minutes are wasted every time an employee leaves a desk to walk up the road to a coffee bar, even if they order a drink in a paper cup to take back to work. So companies are now installing coffee carts - and even full-scale espresso bars - in their buildings, with baristas dedicated to concocting the perfect cappuccino for office staff. \"We have tons and tons of requests for coffee in offices,\" says Laurie Morgan, marketing director of Costa Coffee. \"Four years ago, I was thrilled to have a push-button dispenser machine in the office, but I'd never drink it now. It's a bit like white wine,\" she adds. \"We've moved on from Liebfraumilch.\" Well, you may have done, Laurie, but I happen to rather like the stuff. Drank nothing else at the Office Hours Christmas do, in fact. Come to think of it, nothing else was on offer... Costa sends travelling bands of baristas around the country training company caterers in the mystical Jedi art of preparing gourmet coffee. Costa Coffee is now served in the British offices of Shell, Hewlett Packard, JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank. And if the cafe won't come to the office, you will soon be able to take the office to the cafe as Starbucks have signed a deal with computer firm Compaq to provide customers with internet access. But Morgan, a Canadian, says the explosion in demand for good coffee signifies more than high levels of caffeine addiction among office staff. \"You're not paying \u00a31.70 for just a coffee,\" she says. It's the whole idea of nipping out for a coffee to get away from the office or to have a treat and get a bit of your own time. It's about 'value for time' - there's a new phrase for ya!\" And very nice, too, thanks. \"In the UK, you guys used to have long office lunches, put down on expenses, but those days are over and coffee is the new treat,\" she adds. But we all need our treats and if coffee is the new one shouldn't we be resisting the latest blend on the market - that of the office with the cafe? What seems at first glance like a progressive development for staff freedom could in fact be another erosion of our liberties. We'll soon be tethered like goats to our desks, little troughs of coffee keeping us awake, and beady-eyed Guardian readers peering intently at us over the hedge that has just sprung up behind the fax. Then sugar lumps will be the new treat."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
