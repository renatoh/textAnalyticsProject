In its centre, Ahmed al-Masery sits in an empty coffee shop watching highlights on a tiny, wall-hung TV of his old friend playing for Liverpool against Roma. \u201cI used to play football games on PlayStation with him back in the day,\u201d says the 35-year-old, gesturing at the screen. Back then, Salah would pick Liverpool to play video games with his friend. Now the player is the Merseyside club\u2019s favourite adopted son, a striker whose goals have inspired his team into the Champions League final later this month. Fans are devoted to their \u201cEgyptian king\u201d \u2013 one song includes the line \u201cif he scores another few, I\u2019ll be Muslim too\u201d. For the people of Nagrig, a small farming community two buses and a train-ride north of Cairo, Salah\u2019s rise is scarcely believable. The 25-year-old comes back to the village about once a year, al-Masery says, but he\u2019s been totally unspoilt by fame. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t even drive when he comes here,\u201d he says. \u201cHe walks around the streets like everyone else, speaking to anyone who wants to talk to him.\u201d In Britain, Salah is an emerging phenomenon. In Egypt, his progress has been watched and charted for years. It\u2019s difficult to overemphasise his popularity \u2013 his face is everywhere. Every coffee shop has a Salah poster. Murals featuring him alongside other icons of Egyptian culture, such as singer Umm Kulthum and novelist Naguib Mahfouz, have appeared around the capital. He beams out from billboards, selling everything from chocolate bars to soft drinks, mobile-phone tariffs and bank accounts. Such is the power of the Mo Salah brand, that when he lent his name to a government-sponsored anti-drugs campaign, they reported a 400% increase in calls to their hotline. Much has been made in the Egyptian press of Salah\u2019s charity work. It\u2019s been widely reported that he regularly helps newlyweds furnish their new homes with everything they need for marriage, although the recipients of these gifts have never come out publicly. Newspaper columnists and talk-show hosts delight in sharing examples like these of Salah\u2019s good nature, but al-Masery is one of many Nagrig residents who are sceptical. \u201cMost of these stories are just hearsay,\u201d he says. One particularly popular Salah story came after LE 30,000 (\u00a31,250) was stolen from Salah\u2019s father. The thief was caught and in act of forgiveness, Salah\u2019s family did not press charges. Retellings of the story in the press, however, have Salah intervening personally to help the man find work. One version even has Salah giving the man a wad of cash. \u201cThe media just wants to talk about Salah, Salah, Salah,\u201d al-Masery says. \u201cHe\u2019s a nice guy, and very respectful, but not everything written about him is true.\u201d Not everybody shares al-Masery\u2019s scepticism about the Salah story. In Cairo, where 200 punters crammed onto the pavement at an outdoor coffee shop to watch Liverpool secure their place in the Champion\u2019s League final, 29-year-old football fan Omar Salem says he \u201cdoesn\u2019t care\u201d if certain details about the striker are false. \u201cPeople want to believe these things about him,\u201d he says. \u201cAt this point he\u2019s so loved that nobody would ever deny them.\u201d Before last July, you\u2019d be hard pressed to find anyone here supporting the Merseyside club. That\u2019s all changed this season, though, with football fans regularly turning out in force, for every Liverpool game. \u201cIt would just be amazing to have an Egyptian player win the Champion\u2019s League,\u201d Salem says. Salem says it was Egypt\u2019s match against Congo in October that marked the beginning of his status as a national icon. Salah\u2019s penalty, four minutes into injury time, put Egypt ahead at the 11th hour, securing the team a place in its first World Cup in 28 years. \u201cWhen he celebrated that goal,\u201d says Salem, \u201cthat\u2019s the image people will remember from that match.\u201d Salem calls Salah the first big Egyptian player \u201cthat people can actually relate to\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t even know what car he drives,\u201d says Salem. Instead, Salah\u2019s story is that of a humble teenager, who through sheer grit and determination earned the chance to represent his country in the big leagues of Europe. For the kids of Nagrig, at least, the legend of Mohamed Salah is very real. His former school was renamed in his honour, and to talk to pupils here, you\u2019d think his story was part of the curriculum. One such pupil, 13-year-old Osama Eid, tells the story of Salah\u2019s rise to fame as if reciting his 12-times-tables. \u201cHe\u2019s very respectful and kind,\u201d he says, \u201cand well-mannered and does a lot of work to help the poor.\u201d According to Eid\u2019s friends, he\u2019s the best footballer of their gang. When asked if he\u2019d like to be like Salah one day, he doesn\u2019t skip a beat: \u201cInshallah.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
