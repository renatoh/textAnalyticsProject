Three straight wins have confounded those who thought City\u2019s latest European campaign was doomed to early failure, instead they were the first English team to qualify for the last 16. And, while last season\u2019s domestic runners-up cannot be taken lightly, Joe Hart believes City now have the confidence to take on Europe\u2019s biggest challenges. \u201cWe are realistic enough to know a draw would be a good result for us too but we are going to turn up with every intention of winning the game,\u201d the goalkeeper says. \u201cWe could have the group sewn up before the last home game, and it\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve had that carrot in front of us. It is a new experience but it is moving in the right way and that\u2019s what we want to continue.\u201d Hart would be the first to admit it has taken City a while to come to terms with the demands of the Champions League. \u201cIt has taken a little longer than we thought. You realise quite quickly that one bad result can really cost you. In such a small table of four teams, one or two poor results and you\u2019re dead. That\u2019s obvious, I don\u2019t mean it took us a long time to realise that but it can creep up on you pretty quickly. That\u2019s what happened last year. Before we knew it we had to go to Roma and play out of our skins just to get through the group. That\u2019s why it is so pleasing to be where we are at the moment, because everyone says winning your home games is the key to getting out of the group and we lost our first one. \u201cThe funny thing is that we even took a bit of confidence out of the defeat to Juventus, because we knew we had played well and dominated a lot of the game. We lost because Gianluigi Buffon had a good game, we didn\u2019t make the most of our chances and Juventus took theirs, and that is exactly what the Champions League is like. You are in a much tighter group situation than you are in your domestic league, so you can\u2019t really accept a narrow loss. It\u2019s all out. If you are losing you need to draw, and if you are drawing you need to win. That\u2019s the mentality the best teams bring to bear.\u201d As one of the players who has been involved in City\u2019s Champions League adventure from the start, Hart is well placed to judge whether five years of learning and improving mean the club are ready to take their place among the smallish group that might be described as Europe\u2019s best. \u201cWe are fighting in one of the toughest divisions in the world and we are up and around the top of it, so there\u2019s no reason why we shouldn\u2019t compete on the European stage. I would back our squad 100%. We\u2019ve got great owners, we have invested well, we have been given every tool required to achieve success in Europe. So now it is down to us as players. \u201cThe club clearly wants to win the Champions League at some point, and the players have to adopt the same mentality. There\u2019s no point in thinking that the last 16 is good enough, or reaching the semi-final would be an achievement, the only mentality we can have is that we want to win the competition. The only way we are going to keep our places and be part of all the good things happening here is if we do something like that.\u201d While City have clearly been working on building up a bullish confidence, retaining their game face in Europe will be all the more difficult after Saturday\u2019s setback, when they were comprehensively dismantled by Liverpool at home. Both managers agreed the final score could easily have been 6-1 or 7-1, in fact it was largely down to Hart that the visitors had to be content with 4-1. \u201cIt was a tough result for us, a bad day all round and we have to hold our hands up and congratulate Liverpool for playing well. But that\u2019s gone now, there\u2019s no time for feeling sorry for ourselves. We\u2019ve moved into a separate competition where a win would put us into a really good place. \u201cFootball at this level is all about being ready for the next game, whatever the previous result. It\u2019s the same as when we\u2019ve smashed someone 6-0 or 5-1, you have to take the good and bad from the game and move on to the next. What you must do is live in the moment, in the now. So Juventus is presently the biggest game of my season and when that is out of the way it will be Southampton on Saturday.\u201d Before the Premier League resumes Hart, who is a BT ambassador, will crave the chance to catch up with one of his heroes in Italy. The goalkeeper makes no secret of his admiration for Buffon, his Juventus counterpart, who at the age of 37 has just broken the club\u2019s appearance record. Manuel Pellegrini suggested last week that Hart\u2019s own career might last as long, though the player thinks he would be lucky. \u201cThat is body reliant, you never know how the future is going to pan out. I feel good at the moment and I never want to stop, playing every few days isn\u2019t a problem but I don\u2019t know how that changes as you get older. \u201cIt is easy to talk about records, but I am 28 and have it all in front of me. Buffon has actually done it, and because of his longevity, his quality and the way he has looked after himself it\u2019s no fluke. \u201cI used to watch him on television on Sunday afternoons when I was growing up. He was massive then and he\u2019s still going, showing no signs of letting up. He\u2019s won the World Cup, he\u2019s done the lot. He\u2019s a real inspiration, and every time I come up against him he seems to have a great game.\u201d Juventus v Manchester City is live and exclusive on BT Sport 2 from 7pm on Wednesday.
