Salah has been widely criticised for his reaction to the challenge that brought Liverpool their equaliser on Saturday, with the West Ham manager, David Moyes, claiming Salah \u201cthrew himself to the ground\u201d to deceive the referee, Kevin Friend. The Liverpool manager insists the spot-kick was awarded for a clear foul and that Salah, who converted it for his eighth goal of the season, was still feeling the effects of the defender\u2019s tackle on Sunday. Klopp said: \u201cWhat can I say? It was a foul. Pretty much everyone who saw the situation thought it [was a foul]. Believe it or not, I spoke to Mo yesterday morning about how he feels. He has exactly three proper knocks on the foot and one of them is from the penalty situation. That\u2019s how it is. \u201cThere is a knock, you go down or not, whatever. Sometimes the refs give it. We don\u2019t talk too long about all the penalties we don\u2019t get, to be honest, but obviously now two days after the game we are talking about this. There was clear contact. I don\u2019t understand the criticism.\u201d Liverpool face what Klopp described as \u201cthe biggest challenge in the Champions League\u201d so far on Tuesday when they visit last season\u2019s quarter-finalists Atalanta in Bergamo. Gian Piero Gasperini\u2019s team scored 98 goals in Serie A last season, the highest total in Italy\u2019s top flight for more than 60 years, and Klopp believes there are comparisons between their style and Marcelo Bielsa\u2019s Leeds. Klopp, who has Jo\u00ebl Matip, Naby Ke\u00efta and Kostas Tsimikas back in training after injury, said: \u201cAtalanta are very special in their approach, slightly similar to Leeds. Top players, top recruitment, very well organised, play their system with 100% conviction; they know exactly what everyone has to do and use the skills of individuals in incredibly smart ways. \u201cYou can see [Alejandro] G\u00f3mez in midfield, a completely free, floating genius and they make it very difficult to catch him. There has been some impressive developments of players. They have a lot of these kind of stories and in the team there is a really good atmosphere and a good mood. \u201cTheir last season was a good one and we know how difficult the season was for everyone in Bergamo [because of the coronavirus pandemic]. They dealt with the situation and I respect that. I know how good they are. I enjoyed analysing them because it is really interesting and if you see something interesting you should try to learn a little bit from it. It will be a tough one.\u201d Liverpool are top of their Champions League group with a 100% record and have also risen to the Premier League summit since the setbacks of losing 7-2 at Aston Villa and Virgil van Dijk\u2019s injury. Trent Alexander-Arnold admits the champions were \u201chumbled\u201d by that emphatic defeat at Villa Park but have rediscovered their focus as a result. \u201cIt was about self-reflection in that period [after Villa] and knowing that can\u2019t happen,\u201d the defender said. \u201cIt was kind of a one-off. To concede seven goals is unacceptable but it is about learning from these things. It kind of humbled us as a team and it let us know we can\u2019t just win games because we are Liverpool with the history of the club and the players we\u2019ve got. It is about mentality and the work we put in. If we are not at 100% these things can happen. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an outrageously bad performance but our mentality wasn\u2019t there on the day and we got punished. Since then we have been really able to focus on that and looking back on the last two years especially, it is our mentality that has got us to where we are now. \u201cIt has enabled us to come back from any position, to break through walls and kick down doors in that respect. Since that game we have been able to get back into that stride.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
