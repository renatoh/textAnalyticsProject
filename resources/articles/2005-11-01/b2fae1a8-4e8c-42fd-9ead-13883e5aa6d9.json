It emerged this afternoon that the work and pensions secretary did not inform the advisory committee on business appointments about a job with a charity for which he was paid \u00a315,000 - \u00a320,000. Mr Blunkett said: \"The prime minister has made his decision and, no matter what the Conservative party want, I am not resigning.\" The cabinet minister will face a grilling by the work and pensions select committee tomorrow morning, ostensibly on his policy brief, but MPs will be free to raise the issue of his breaches of the ministerial code. With the weekly prime ministers' questions also tomorrow, Mr Blair is almost certain to be asked why he is standing by a minister who has admitted breaking the code. At least one Labour MP has already broken ranks to suggest Mr Blunkett should go. The PM defended his cabinet colleague this morning, saying that Mr Blunkett's breach of the ministerial code in his involvement with a DNA testing firm was a \"mistake\" but not one that affected his ability to do his job. Mr Blunkett worked for DNA Bioscience for two weeks in April, after he resigned as home secretary, but failed to consult the advisory committee on business appointments, as the code dictates he should. He also took a job at the business consultancy Indepen, without seeking advice from the committee. And this afternoon it was revealed that he had taken a third job, with the Organisation for Research and Technology, without the necessary consultation. According to the April 2005 edition of parliament's register of members' interests, Mr Blunkett earned \u00a315,000-\u00a320,000 as an adviser to the organisation, which is described as an international charity. On that revelation, Downing Street tonight again defended Mr Blunkett, saying it was the \"same mistake\" as with the other two cases. The prime minister's official spokesman said: \"David Blunkett has the prime minister's full support. That remains the case.\" He added: \"Did David Blunkett place these jobs on the register of members' interests? Yes he did. Did he declare them to his permanent secretary? Yes he did. \"Did the company concerned have contract with either the CSA or the Department of Work and Pensions? The answer to that is no.\" But the shadow leader of the Commons, Chris Grayling - who is leading the attack for the Tories on the issue - said this afternoon that he had once more written to Tony Blair to challenge him to act over Mr Blunkett's conduct. Mr Grayling said: \"I am astonished that Mr Blunkett has broken the ministerial code on yet another occasion. This is getting beyond a joke. \"Tony Blair cannot claim the ministerial code is important and fail to act over these breaches.\" In an interview with his local newspaper today, Mr Blunkett was defiant. He told the Sheffield Star: \"The pressure is not continuing. \"The prime minister has made his decision and, no matter what the Conservative party want, I am not resigning. \"This is a straight political battle with the Conservative party and their allies in the media, and decency. \"I have done nothing wrong at any stage. I have been transparent about everything I have done.\" But, in a sign that parliamentary support for Mr Blunkett may be ebbing, a Labour MP today suggested the minister may consider resigning. Ian Gibson told the BBC's World at One: \"It was a very daft thing to do and, if it was me, I would think about taking an early bath. \"I can't see that it is sustainable, really.\" Mr Blunkett's fellow Sheffield MP Clive Betts told the programme: \"I don't think that's the view that the vast majority of Labour MPs would take.\" At a press launch today of the civil service diversity action plan, the cabinet secretary who advised Mr Blunkett he was obliged to tell the advisory committee about his outside jobs, Sir Gus O'Donnell, repeatedly refused to answer questions about the affair. This morning, Mr Blair rejected calls for Mr Blunkett to be reprimanded or to resign over the issues arising out of his involvement with DNA Bioscience. At the morning lobby briefing today, Mr Blair's official spokesman told journalists: \"David Blunkett has accepted he made a mistake. \"The question is, does that mistake stop him doing his job? The prime minister's judgment is that it does not.\" Only the PM has the power to arbitrate over the ministerial code. This afternoon Mr Blunkett attended the memorial service for the victims of July's London bombing. The work and pensions secretary has a full in-tray, with an overhaul of the Child Support Agency, an incapacity benefit green paper and a far-reaching report on pension reform from Adair Turner, all looming. Both the Tories and Liberal Democrats have stopped just short of demanding Mr Blunkett's immediate resignation, but have called into question his judgment and asked for a full independent inquiry. The shadow work and pensions secretary, Sir Malcolm Rifkind, this morning said Mr Blunkett had \"lost the plot\". His poor judgment had made him \"damaged property\" politically, and meant he was no longer an asset to the government, Sir Malcolm told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
