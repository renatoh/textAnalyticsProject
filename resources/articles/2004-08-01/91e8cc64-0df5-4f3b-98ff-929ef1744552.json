The US Olympians had one of the most formidable records in international sport: played 109, lost two - both of those to the Soviet Union, and one still hotly disputed - while winning 12 gold medals in the process. Since 1992 and the entrance of professional basketballers the US hadn't lost once. Until Sunday, that is, when plucky Puerto Rico - boasting only one player who could be considered a household name outside his own household - not only beat the US but thrashed it soundly. \"Red, white and boo,\" was the headline in one US paper. True, the US side was missing several top players, including one on trial for rape, but it was still packed with millionaire stars. For Puerto Rico, long in the shadow of the US, with a population of just 4 million compared to the US's 280 million, the victory comes as a huge triumph. It may finally convince the US to enlist the island as the 51st state, several American commentators noted. But for the US, the omens are less promising. For many years the NBA, the professional US league, has valued razzmatazz and flashy skills, causing it to diverge from the rules of international competition. As a result the US has found itself isolated, complacently playing its own game. When exposed to the rest of the world, it has been found wanting. The parallels between sport and geopolitics have never been more apt. There is another unhappy parallel. The British invented football, and have endured being humbled by upstart rivals ever since, a process that has gnawed away at national self-belief. The US invented basketball, and are now reaping its harvest. As with Harold Wilson and the 1970 election loss that followed England's footballing defeat earlier that year, so George Bush should now be worried."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
