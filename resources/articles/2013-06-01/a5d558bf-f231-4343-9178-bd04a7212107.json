The shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg is to challenge \"Michael Gove's [education secretary] incoherent approach that grants some schools access to freedoms that help raise standards while denying them to others.\" In a speech on Monday, Twigg will propose that a Labour government embraces several policies applied to academies, and extends them throughout the state sector. They would include the ability to opt out of following the national curriculum; to utilise a greater degree of financial freedom; and to make it easier for schools to vary the length of their working day. \"We know that giving schools more freedom over how they teach and how they run and organise their schools can help to raise standards. So why should we deny those freedoms to thousands of schools? All schools should have them \u2013 not just academies and free schools,\" Twigg will say in London. He is also expected to announce new measures to overhaul school admissions and make the system fairer after recent research by the Sutton Trust highlighting inequality in admissions to the best non-selective state schools. \"Labour believes that there is a strong case to look again at the admissions code. There are too many schools \u2013 schools of all types \u2013 not fulfilling their duties, to the letter and in the spirit of, fair admissions,\" a Labour source said. According to the Sutton Trust, England's top 500 state-funded comprehensive and academy schools taught fewer than the national average of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, and fewer than other schools in their area. It proposed radical reforms, including the greater use of lotteries and admission by bands of ability. Twigg would also end Gove's policy of allowing free schools and academies to employ untrained teachers \u2013 and would give the 5,000 such teachers two years to gain relevant qualifications or be sacked. The proposal, first reported by the Observer yesterday, would face legal obstacles, according to a Whitehall source. \"Labour's policy ignores that the Department for Education does not employ teachers, therefore cannot fire them, and any attempt to do what Labour's talking about would be illegal under European Union and European court of human rights law,\" a DfE source said. Labour's proposals would not extend further flexibility in varying teacher pay and conditions, and would stick to the current settlement, arguing that even most academies are happy to use the existing national pay framework. Twigg's proposals would not lead to all schools becoming academies. Academies would retain their status and new academies would not be ruled out, while the national curriculum would be made less prescriptive and focused on educational attainment. Labour would also tackle the problem of \"singleton\" academies, the three-fifths of academy-status schools that are not part of a chain. \"The evidence on school improvement, from home and abroad, demonstrates that partnerships, federations between schools, are key to raising teaching standards, leadership skills and sharing best practice,\" Twigg will say. \"Michael Gove used to talk the talk on schools working together but he's failed to deliver.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
