The Stop the War coalition called the emergency protest in Parliament Square on the eve of Wednesday\u2019s House of Commons vote on whether to send British warplanes to bomb Islamic State strongholds in the country. Lindsey German, the convenor of Stop the War, told the crowd: \u201cWe are here to say one very simple thing: don\u2019t bomb Syria. Do not this time go and bomb a country where you make it even worse than it was before.\u201d Salma Yaqoob, the head of Birmingham Stop the War coalition, said: \u201cWe don\u2019t seem to have learned a single thing [from the invasion of Iraq]. When we bomb other people\u2019s countries, we do not become more safe. We become less safe. If you bomb them, we will not be safe at home.\u201d The march, which was peaceful at first, turned into a sit-down protest outside the Houses of Parliament, with 150 people refusing to move as traffic built up. Protesters chanted: \u201cDavid Cameron, shame on you\u201d and \u201cStop the killing, stop the hate\u201d on the road. The protest turned violent, however, when police moved in to drag demonstrators off the road outside the Palace of Westminster. Some were physically removed and a few scuffles broke out. At least one man was wrestled into the back of a police van. It was unclear how many people were present at the protest, but more than 3,500 people said they were attending the event on Facebook. Stop the War has condemned Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s decision to grant a free vote to Labour MPs, with Andrew Murray, the group\u2019s chairman, saying it had \u201ccleared the way\u201d for the Commons to back airstrikes. A statement on the Stop the War website read: \u201cBritain has been the most aggressive country in Europe over the last 15 years, leading military interventions in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya. Yet it has done little to help the victims of the wars it so enthusiastically pursues and it has been at the forefront of opposing a humane policy towards refugees. \u201cAnother destructive bombing campaign is no solution whatsoever. It will make moves toward a political solution harder. It risks intensifying and widening what is already a catastrophic war.\u201d The protest comes after thousands of people demonstrated outside Downing Street on Saturday. Parts of Whitehall were brought to a halt during that event, where speakers included the actor Mark Rylance and the musician Brian Eno. A statement by more than 50 student leaders was issued on Tuesday, saying: \u201cBritish military action will not defeat Isis and risks increasing the terrorist threat both to the peoples of the Middle East and to Britain.\u201d John Gillespie, a 29-year-old medical student, said: \u201cWe could be sanctioning Saudi Arabia and Turkey. It\u2019s far too early to be thinking about bombing.\u201d George Galloway, the former MP for Bradford West, said a war could not possibly go well. He said MPs\u2019 phones had been \u201cringing off the hook\u201d with constituents urging them to vote against airstrikes. \u201cWe may yet be able to deprive David Cameron of a majority. Tell them [the MPs] we are demanding they say no to war on Syria. This is a war that even rightwing personalities know is ill-conceived, ill-intentioned and ill-fated,\u201d he said. Imran Hussain, MP for Bradford East, said: \u201cThe people of Bradford sent me, and the people of Bradford expect me, to stand up and be counted. I bring solidarity from the north of England. Let not history repeat itself.\u201d This article was amended on 2 December 2015. The medical student quoted is called John Gillespie, not David Gillespie. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
