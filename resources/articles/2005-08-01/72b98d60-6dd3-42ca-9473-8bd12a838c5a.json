James Schiro, chief executive of ZFS, claimed in a newspaper interview yesterday that the company's recovery from its recent woes was so complete that it was starting to think again about growth, including acquisitions. Traders said RSA would be a logical target for ZFS, which owns Eagle Star, provided RSA could draw a line under its problems in the United States. Andy Haste, chief executive of RSA, said last week that its withdrawal from the US market, which has been its achilles heel, was well under way. That news came as RSA, which was briefly a takeover target for controversial financier Andrew Regan this year, reported a 79% increase in operating profits and said its turnaround was starting to bear fruit. Royal &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;SunAlliance shares ended the day 3.75p higher at 96.5p. In the wider market, leading shares closed lower for a fourth consecutive session, dragged down by a sharp fall on Wall Street and news that British consumer prices had risen at their highest pace for about eight years in July. That unnerved investors, who have now given up hope of another interest rate cut this year. The final scores showed the FTSE 100 down 21.9 points at 5322.3, with Cable &amp; Wireless the biggest faller. Its shares, up 30% in the past three months, slipped 6.75p to 156.25p as the company revealed that cost savings from its acquisition of Energis would be smaller than expected. It also said its share buyback programme would be suspended for now. The mobile phone operator O2, off 3.75p at 142.75p, was also under pressure after Deutsche Telekom admitted it had been talking to its Dutch rival KPN about launching a break-up bid for O2 but that the discussions had ended. Elsewhere, the FTSE 250 eased 9.6 points to 7697, while the FTSE Small Cap index shed 3.3 points to finish at 3081.2. Turnover was again light with 2.5bn shares changing hands across the market. In the bond market, the benchmark 10-year gilt closed at about 103.680, yielding 4.295%. The newspaper group Daily Mail &amp; General Trust managed to buck yesterday's weak market, rising 16p to 671.5p on the back of a Deutsche Bank upgrade to buy. The German broker told clients that the company was trading at a 10% premium to its FTSE 250 rival Trinity Mirror, up 8.5p to 617.5p, despite the superior quality of its national newspaper assets and the potential to restructure its regional newspaper business. Reuters, the news and financial information group, rallied 3p to 365.25p after Man Securities said the recent sell-off had provided an excellent entry point for investors. Reuters shares were trading at 412p before the company flagged the cost of its new strategy late last month. In fact, most of the media sector closed higher yesterday as investors took advantage of recent weakness to snap up cheap stock. The FTSE Media Sector has underperformed the wider market in recent months. ITV gained 2.25p to 117.75p, while WPP added 10p to 595.5p and Pearson improved 7p to 686.5p. Rentokil Initial firmed 1p to 151.5p as rumours of private equity interest resurfaced. Exel, another rumoured takeover target, gained 8.5p to finish at 995.5p. After the market closed, Bruce Edwards, the head of its American division, revealed he had exercised options over 215,000 shares and then sold 188,000 of them. Lower down the market, buyers emerged for housebuilding stocks despite the bearish inflation report. Traders attributed this to indications of activity in the housing market. This was first detected in last week's results from the estate agent Countrywide, off 1p at 336p, and backed up by the latest survey from the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors. Released overnight, this showed that during July house prices had fallen at their slowest pace in five months. Wilson Bowden was the sector's biggest riser, advancing 39p to \u00a311.20, closely followed by Bovis Homes Group, 19.5p better at 621p, and Redrow, up 11p to 393p. Bovis was also supported by a Panmure Gordon upgrade to buy. On the downside, the casino operator Stanley Leisure slipped 17.5p to 567.5p after Altium Securities downgraded to hold, citing valuation, while Catlin Group, the insurer and reinsurer, fell back 7p to 473.5p after Citigroup Smith Barney removed the stock from its buy list. The US broker believes Catlin shares, which have risen 45% this year, are up with events. Spirent, the telecoms testing specialist, was marked 1p higher at 55p as traders took the view that it could become a takeover target for its American rival Agilent Technologies, which on Monday night announced a radical restructuring programme. In the smaller companies world, Alexandra, the workwear supplier, eased 1.5p to 126.5p despite talk of predatory interest from Johnson Service Group, which was unchanged at 440.5p. Hot Group, the online recruitment company being courted by three newspaper groups, held firm at 18.75p. After hours, DC Thomson, the Scottish newspaper group, revealed an increased holding of 2.18%. On Aim, the tiny property fund management company Mercury Group rose 0.04p, or 9.6%, to 0.44p after appointing Stephen Russell as a non-executive director. Mr Russell is the finance director of Consensus Business Group, the property company controlled by the financier Vincent Tchenguiz. Last month Mr Tchenguiz acquired a 26% stake in Mercury. As such, traders reckon this is one stock to keep an eye on. Page on the turn? Are shares in Michael Page fully valued? That was the question City traders were being forced to contemplate yesterday as it emerged that the chief executive, Terry Benson, had sold a third of his holding in Britain's second-biggest recruitment group. In a stock exchange filing, the company said Mr Benson had offloaded 1m shares at 248p on Monday. The sale came after Michael Page had reported a 77% rise in interim pre-tax profits, fuelled by a sharp recovery in continental Europe and a strong performance from its core British business. Michael Page shares have enjoyed a strong run this year. They have risen 32% so far, outperforming the FTSE All-Share index by 19% in the process and closed yesterday at a high of 248.25p, up 0.75p."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
