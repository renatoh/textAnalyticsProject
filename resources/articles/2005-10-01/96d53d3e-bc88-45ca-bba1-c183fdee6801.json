He needs a dog", "bodyText": "Fielding's wife and daughters are begging him to get a dog. For his own good of course. Now that he has raging blood pressure, needs to mellow out, has retired and is slobbing about the house doing nothing, what he clearly needs is a dog. Dogs are good for the heart. And bowels, in my experience. I remind Fielding that a few days cuddling the new dog brought to an end my mother's 40-year battle with constipation. Everybody knows that dogs are good for the health. \"Oh. I see,\" says Fielding cynically. \"The University of Everybody. Anything scientific?\" If only he had a darling, cuddly, relaxing dog, perhaps he wouldn't be such a miserable toad. He may be resisting because in his youth, a dog nearly bit half his face off and more recently numerous dogs repeatedly tried to murder his elderly cat. But right now he needs to be out there exercising, in the park, among the leaves of red and gold. \"Autumn may be charming,\" says Fielding, \"but I'm thinking of mid-February. And what about the vet's bills and insurance and food? How much do those dogs cost you? Go on. How much?\" I round down the cost. Why put the frighteners on Fielding? Why tell him that my dogs have had four operations between them over three weeks, causing near bankruptcy and intensive home nursing, that Sylvia's new puppy is flooding her kitchen with wee, snores loudly, has distressed the Siamese cat and made it scream, or that my whole house stinks of dog, all clothing and upholstery is coated with hairs, one dog has chewed its stitches out and the other ate my silk-bound 1871 edition of Joseph Andrews? Fielding need not follow my example. No one's asking him to buy two huge, muscular, inbred pedigrees, prone to tumours and colitis. He can choose a hardy mongrel. Or a chilled greyhound. Then he will realise that, despite everything, a dog is still worth it. \"I'd prefer a darling, cuddly, relaxing, offensive parrot,\" barks Fielding, \"to tell you to ...\" Would a dog consider him worth it?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
