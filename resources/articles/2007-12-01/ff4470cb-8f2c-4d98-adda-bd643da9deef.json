He is terrorising some of the best bowlers on the planet all because of a short stint with Warwickshire last season. \"It was a fantastic experience for me being a Bear and I was over the moon to get my county cap,\" he said last night, after his 152 against England at the Asgiriya Stadium had placed the tourists firmly on the back foot in the first Test. \"That experience had a big impact on me. I was their overseas player and they left me in no doubt that they were paying me to score runs. I was also on my own, which meant I had to look after my conditioning, my food and everything else. \"I had a lot of independence and it helps you mature as a cricketer when you play outside your country. In terms of facilities and structure, first-class cricket in England is better than what we have.\" It could hardly be said that Warwickshire had a successful season last summer. They were relegated in both the championship and the Pro40 League, winning just two matches in each. They won just two of their last 20 matches in all competitions and in the championship no player scored 900 runs or took as many as 35 wickets, which explains why they sacked their coach, Mark Greatbatch. Sangakkara was a success, though he played just seven championship games, topping the averages with 496 runs at 49.60. But since then he has enjoyed an orgy of international run-scoring and in his last four Tests has scored 200 not out, 222 not out, 57 and 192 and, here, 92 and 152, his 16th Test century. Yesterday he rarely looked like getting out - though Ryan Sidebottom would beg to differ, having Sangakkara badly dropped by his Warwickshire team-mate Ian Bell at first slip when he was still two short of his century. Since giving up the wicketkeeper's gloves after last year's tour of England, Sangakkara has virtually doubled an already proud Test batting record. \"Batting at three and keeping wicket on the subcontinent is a bit of an ask,\" he said. \"It's a job I've been very happy to do. But maybe that bit of fatigue going out of my game and being a lot fresher has a lot to do with it.\" He is the first batsman - and this is one for the anoraks - to have scored 150 or more in four consecutive Test matches. \"My whole game hinges on how well I prepare. But I have also come to understand my game a lot better over the past two years. I have a better knowledge on what to work at in practice. \"I make sure I do the basics right and now, when I go into a game, everything just seems to fall into place. I don't want to be just another cricketer who comes and is gone. You've got to walk away with something behind you.\" England would have been more than happy if he had walked away with something very meagre behind him yesterday. But together with his captain, Mahela Jayawardene, he surely put this match beyond England's desperate grasp. \"I was told years ago that whenever I get to fifty I must make sure I get to 100,\" he explained. These days, though, Sangakkara, 30, is admirably dissatisfied with three figures. In the past he has been a solid but unspectacular performer against England. Last year this elegant left-hander was second in the batting averages but only with 231 runs from six innings at 38.50. He averaged 33 with a best score of 71 on England's last tour here four years ago. This, he explained, was why he got twitchy when he neared his first Test century against England yesterday to complete the set against all the Test- playing countries. \"No matter how many hundreds you have made, the first hundred you score against any country makes you a bit nervous. \"Now I want to go on. To be recognised as a great player you must score a minimum of 20 [Test] hundreds.\" England must be really looking forward to Colombo.
