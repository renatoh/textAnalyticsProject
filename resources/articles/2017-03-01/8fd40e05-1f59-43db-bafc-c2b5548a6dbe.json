New Zealand\u2019s head coach was complimentary about England following their 61-21 win against Scotland, suggesting they looked fitter and more motivated than they had done previously. Jones, however, suspects Hansen of trying to lull his squad \u2013 and, potentially, the British &amp; Irish Lions \u2013 into a false sense of security. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like Little Red Riding Hood and the Big Bad Wolf when the wolf comes dressed up as the grandmother,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWhen an All Black coach is complimenting you, you always have to be careful.\u201d England are not due to face New Zealand for another 18 months but will end the Six Nations ranked second behind the All Blacks regardless of whether they complete a grand slam in Dublin on Saturday. Jones repeatedly talks about England\u2019s desire to knock the world champions off their lofty perch but does not want his players getting ahead of themselves. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to worry about [New Zealand] because we are not playing them,\u201d he said. \u201cAll we have to do is worry about playing against Ireland.\u201d The mental image of Hansen clad in wolf\u2019s clothing will not be easy to shift, another bonus from Jones\u2019s point of view. He will not have forgotten the lampooning of himself and Australia\u2019s Michael Chieka as clowns by Australian and New Zealand publications last year but, more pertinently, he is determined to ensure England develop a harder edge before the 2019 World Cup. That goal was the subject of a \u201ccleansing meeting\u201d in Oxford after the Italy game when the squad openly discussed how to deal with their lengthening unbeaten record. \u201cWe just felt we needed to reset our minds a little bit,\u201d Jones said. \u201cYou can feel within the team there\u2019s a different intensity about the way we do things. I thought we were always going to play well against Scotland \u2013 and I think we\u2019ll play better this week. \u201cWhat we said \u2013 and we had a great discussion \u2013 is that we have to acknowledge we\u2019ve been successful and it\u2019s now about how much we want to be great. How many opportunities in your life do you get to beat Ireland in Ireland to win back-to-back grand slams? It\u2019s almost a childhood dream as a rugby player.\u201d Part of the process, Jones said, is to treat this week\u2019s concluding game like a World Cup final, even though England are already Six Nations champions. \u201cFor us everything\u2019s about the World Cup. If you look at where we are now, we\u2019ve been together approximately eight weeks. You\u2019re together eight or nine weeks to get to a World Cup final. When you get to the World Cup final, no one\u2019s 100%. Everyone\u2019s carrying injuries. \u201cIt\u2019s the team that prepares with the mind-set that nothing\u2019s going to stop them being at their best that wins the World Cup. You want to develop a winning mentality. It\u2019s a great dress rehearsal for us for the World Cup. All these milestones along the way are nice but they\u2019re not things that we cherish. It\u2019s what we do in the future that matters.\u201d Jones is also cautioning his players against assuming Ireland are vulnerable after losing to Wales. He does not know the Ireland head coach, Joe Schmidt, well but believes the home team will be \u201cgrossly disappointed\u201d by their performance in Cardiff. \u201cIreland will come with a lot of emotion. Disappointment builds aggression,\u201d said Jones. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen how Wales came back after losing to Scotland so we expect Ireland to be like that. We have to be more aggressive, more emotional in the right way, more committed as well as smart and skilful.\u201d Nor will England\u2019s players waste time worrying about potential Lions\u2019 showdowns with their Ireland opposite numbers. \u201cOur desire is to be the best team in the world so we don\u2019t need any external motivation,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about the Lions. All we\u2019re worried about is playing well this week. The players realise they have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity here. History shows that winning back-to-back grand slams happens once in every 27 years. None of these players is going to be playing in 27 years\u2019 time.\u201d The England management believe Elliot Daly will be fit to feature against Ireland after breaking his nose and suffering blurred vision against Scotland. The Wasps back is going through the necessary return-to-play protocols which will prevent him from training fully until later in the week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
