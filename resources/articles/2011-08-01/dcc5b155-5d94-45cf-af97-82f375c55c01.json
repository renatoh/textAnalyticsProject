Along with the release of CCTV footage, timely sites like the Catch A Looter blog are busy \"collating all images of looters from the londonriots [sic \u2013 or is it one word now?]\". If you've got a picture of a rioter, face insufficiently shrouded by hoodie, you can email it over. \u2022 One day this gallery of gleeful opportunists may serve as a valuable archive chronicling the moment when rioting become a kind of extreme shopping. The Diary is particularly charmed by a snap of a smiling lad proudly pointing to his just-liberated economy sack of Tesco Value range basmati rice \u2013 but for now you're just meant to ring Crimestoppers. 0800 555 111. \u2022 And it doesn't end there. A Google group called London Riots Facial Recognition has also been set up, with the apparent aim of using the software to identify looters from online pictures. This technology heralds a bright future where everything from mob rule to vigilante justice is organised virtually. Can you wait? \u2022 Not a word from Mail columnist Liz Jones about Somalia, despite a promise to report directly \u2013 and personally \u2013 on the famine there. The last we heard from her was in a column where she castigated the NHS for being slow to arrange her travel jabs. But if she is in Somalia, isn't it time she was recalled to London? Come back, Liz \u2013 your people need you. \u2022 A quick riot week quiz: who said, \"The British public don't simply resort to violent unrest in the face of challenging economic circumstances\", and when? Home Secretary Theresa May, in September, responding to claims that falling police numbers might leave them unable to cope with civil strife caused by spending cuts. It's probably not a statement she'll repeat anytime soon, but if we're honest she was perfectly correct. The British public don't resort to violent unrest in the face of challenging economic circumstances. Not solely anyway. A lot of them don't even need reasons. \u2022 You may well be asking yourself what the hell happened to the silly season, the traditional summer pause in the news cycle where root vegetables shaped like celebrities have a shot at the news pages. Like summer itself, it doesn't look as if we're going to get a proper silly season this year. Could it be something to do with climate change? \u2022 Sorry, one mustn't make light of global warming; too easy to offend sensibilities on either side of the debate. Take this effort from climate change skeptic Richard North's blog, which mines the obvious comic potential in linking global warming, polar bears and sad news from Norway. Noting that the students on that \"fated expedition\" were there to study the effects of climate change, North concedes the deeply ironic point that \"had there been no climate change, the party would not have been there, and the polar bear would not have been shot. Ergo, climate change killed the bear.\" \u2022 He then makes the even more ironic point that it's actually been unseasonably cold in the Arctic, and that the camp's anti-bear tripwires didn't work because they were frozen. I mean, could there be a more salient way to shatter the global warming myth? \"Still,\" he writes, \"one must commend the bear on its good taste in going for an Etonian. We have plenty more if the ursine population is interested ...\" Just shades it wrong there, doesn't he? \u2022 On Twitter, Jeffrey Archer offers a characteristically self-abnegating take on events: \"It is not often that I regret not being Mayor of London,\" he tweets, \"but I do this morning.\" How like him remind us all that we still have something to be thankful for. That Crimestoppers number again: 0800 555 111."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
