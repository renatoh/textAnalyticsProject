It comes as Josh Tyrangiel, a former Bloomberg journalist who was hired last year to oversee the development of a nightly programme to be aired on HBO, is being promoted to oversee the company\u2019s news division. The lay-offs came to public attention on Tuesday after a Vice News foreign correspondent, Harriet Salem, said on Twitter that she and another foreign correspondent were losing their jobs, as well as the London editorial team. It is understood, however, that the bulk of the Vice News operation in the UK, which comprises 18 people working in video production and other roles, will remain intact. In addition to the two foreign correspondents, the cuts involve the departure of three staff in London and 15 staff members in the US. Tyrangiel is in the process of implementing plans to \u201cunify\u201d all of Vice\u2019s various news divisions, according to a source familiar with the matter. They expected this to result in the hiring of new staff, alongside plans to open offices in Hong Kong and San Francisco in the coming months. A senior figure to lead the UK team would be announced in the coming months, the same source confirmed. The developments come after Vice\u2019s UK arm rejected a push for union recognition by a group of staff, bucking a growing trend that has seen unionisation at digital media businesses including at the outlet\u2019s main base in the US. At a meeting in London last month, Vice UK staff were told that the National Union of Journalists would not be recognised but staff were offered the chance to set up an internal staff council. A Vice UK worker, who was involved in the unionisation move, said: \u201cThese redundancies are shocking and an insult to the multi-award winning workers who have put so much into making Vice News a success. \u201cThe total lack of transparency and consultation also raises serious questions about the company\u2019s recent pretence at staff engagement, while failing to recognise the desire of many staff to unionise\u201d Speaking about the developments across the company on Tuesday, a Vice spokesperson said: \u201cThe plan in place will expand Vice\u2019s news offerings across digital and TV, continue the recent of wave of newsroom hires, add additional foreign bureaus and marshal the company\u2019s existing news divisions into one cohesive powerhouse.\u201d In apparently unconnected comments, Vice Media\u2019s CEO, Shane Smith, last week spoke of what he described as a looming \u201cbloodbath in the next 12 months\u201d in the digital, mobile and terrestrial sectors."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
