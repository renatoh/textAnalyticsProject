The last hurrah. The swansong. The final countdow \u2013 oh, let\u2019s just get on with it. Yes, it\u2019s the season finale, and an extra-long episode more packed than the 7.30 from Woking to Waterloo. Tonight, three important characters confront who they have been these past months, none of them happy with what they find. But it is the choices they make afterwards that define them. We open in mild jeopardy. Rowdy crowds have attacked a fellow European club and an English woman has been shot. The \u201cterrorists\u201d had taken umbrage at the sign preventing natives and dogs from entry. Shimla\u2019s ruling class have assembled \u2013 a convocation of fuddy-duddy bald men and their wives \u2013 and vote to lift the colour bar at Coffin\u2019s Royal Club to prevent similar reprisals. Cynthia would rather have norovirus at her club than non-whites, but doesn\u2019t get a say, for perhaps the first time ever. The Viceroy hasn\u2019t bothered making a decision on whether to commute Ramu Sood\u2019s sentence or recommend he hang \u2013 he\u2019s been too busy buffing up his ivory tricycle or something. So the decision has fallen to Ralph. \u201cWhat would you do?\u201d he asks Aafrin, who replies that he couldn\u2019t take a life. \u201cOther people do that,\u201d scoffs Ralph. \u201cI just sign a letter.\u201d I know I\u2019ve compared Ralph to various ranks of the Nazi party throughout these recaps, but he\u2019s making it too easy now. Sepulchral, cell-based horseplay for Sood, who is making fatalistic cracks about his imminent death. Ian, who hasn\u2019t abandoned hope, tries to cheer his friend up by getting on top of the malnourished man and forcing him to wrestle. I\u2019m not sure he understands how prison visits work. The guards don\u2019t think so either \u2013 they haul him off and give Sood another beating. It\u2019s crap being Ramu Sood. Farewell tea for the Raworths. Dougie is off his scones, as is Matthew, who thanks to Ralph has a one-way ticket back to Blighty. Sarah is in an odd mood: happy about returning home and the scones, sad that her marriage is irreparably shattered. \u201cI shall have to get used to doing things alone, shan\u2019t I?\u201d says Dougie, talking about buttering scones, but also his new life. \u201cI expect you\u2019ll get help,\u201d replies Sarah, offering him some acid with his tea. Their final goodbye is beautifully played, though. \u201cI wish I could have given you what you need,\u201d says Doug. \u201cYou did, once or twice. You just never knew it,\u201d replies Sarah, before trundling out of Shimla. Fiona Glascott has handled her character\u2019s brittle fury and humiliated soul brilliantly throughout, and this is a fitting end, if that\u2019s what it is. As for Sarah, I\u2019m glad she\u2019s gone because she was a hornet in a bonnet. Dougie features in the other standout scene tonight. As the only character immune to Ralph\u2019s suavity, it makes sense that Ralph seeks him out to confess. He admits he is Adam\u2019s father. Despite his antipathy to Ralph, Dougie is relieved to talk semi-openly about poor, self-harming Adam, his own anger at himself and Sarah\u2019s unhappiness in Shimla. \u201cYou try to be the man they want,\u201d falters Ralph, and Dougie nods. These men who could not be more different \u2013 the Yorkshireman splitting logs and the Machiavelli in the white suit \u2013 come to a moment of mournful communion for the women they have failed. But we haven\u2019t even really got going yet. The drama ramps up a gear when Ralph\u2019s trusted servant Bhupi hangs himself. Yes, I know, who? Why? What fresh mystery is this? It is resolved pretty quickly, because it is the final episode. Sweet-natured Bhupi killed Jaya. Not at Ralph\u2019s behest, but out of misguided loyalty. A shocked Aafrin and Ralph rescue him, the latter making tender promises in Hindi to look after him, cradling him, the way he cradled Jaya. Characters speak to us most when they try to change. Ralph has spent this episode like a man in search of baptism, trying to start again, save himself. Then again, saving himself is what comes naturally: every scene in which he comes clean ends on another manipulative note. He puts Bhupi to bed, soothing: \u201cWe have to forget it and go on, very quietly, or it will be hard for me.\u201d To maintain a central character\u2019s ambiguity so long is testament to the skilfully nuanced portrayal by Henry Lloyd-Hughes. Maybe I\u2019ll stop calling him Donovan from The Inbetweeners now. Given this noose \u2013 sorry, news \u2013 Aafrin requests clemency for Sood, perhaps even that he be released in a year. You know, what with being completely innocent and all. Ralph agrees, and promises to run the letter of leniency over himself. Gee, I sure hope he remembers to do that! No, of course he doesn\u2019t. Instead he gets up early to deliver the letter recommending Sood be publicly hanged, immediately. He\u2019s just that sort of guy. Sood is led to the gibbet and hanged before a mildly interested crowd and a sobbing Ian. The last person he sees is Cynthia, waving him a sarcastic salute before his neck is snapped, like a Roman emperor sending a gladiator to death. I hope your club burns down, Coffin, and the ground marked in perpetuity as an open urinal for dogs and Indians. Still, I have to keep reminding myself that this is fiction, and Indian Summers has definitely given us a Julie Walters we\u2019ve never seen before. Top marks. The death is a reckoning, which helps the living see themselves clearer. Sooni spits in her brother\u2019s face, calling him a coward, which perhaps he has been. Ralph has ultimately chosen self-protection over his soul. Dougie honours his absent wife by denying himself present happiness with Leena. He will devote his life to the missionary school and children, living in righteous torment. Realising the breadth of Ralph\u2019s malignity, Aafrin seeks out Sergeant Singh and lets him know he is ready to join the revolution. We\u2019re not quite done \u2013 never let it be said that McLeod knows when to let things go. He is determined to turn the episode into an Ealing comedy, sneaking into the police station to steal what he thinks are Sood\u2019s ashes, but which are actually bone-mash for Superintendent Rowntree\u2019s roses. He even throws in a touch of Bourne, stealing one officer\u2019s cudgel to bash sergeant Singh on the bonce and make good his escape. Sergeant Singh doesn\u2019t feel pain, silly! Alice finds him on a country road, being led by children, no idea where he\u2019s going, cheerfully deranged by grief. \u201cCome with us if you like,\u201d Ian calls. She does, because following a man holding a box of ashes into a wood for a trip of indeterminate length sounds like a right laugh. Extraordinarily, a mob of natives has formed to honour Ian, their new folk hero. They hoist him on their shoulders, shouting Sood\u2019s name. It\u2019s lovely, though slightly reminiscent of the Ewoks carrying C-3PO around in Return of the Jedi because they thought he was a god. Comradeship don\u2019t come for free. Singh has challenged Aafrin to steal an effect of Ralph\u2019s to demonstrate commitment. In Ralph\u2019s study, Aafrin locates by chance Adam\u2019s letter, naming Rakshash, his devil-father. He has got a nose for documents that could destabilise regimes, I\u2019ll give him that. But he is not going to be anyone\u2019s patsy again: he hands Singh instead a letter opener, keeping the letter. I guess they are even now. And Aafrin, crucially, still has cards to play. He is an avenging double agent now, codename SHINYSHOES. I like new Aafrin. Cynthia, generous to a racist fault, consents to allow one native member at her club, and wouldn\u2019t you know, Aafrin gets the nod. In a moving scene, he invites his Anglophile Bapi to drink with him, in his medals; the residents greet them with a reception as chilly as the ice in the drinks they won\u2019t serve them. They are not to know Aafrin is now a viper in their bosom. The apolitical Parsi has become a rebel with a cause. And we\u2019re almost done. This series has enjoyed a hell of a turnaround. From great expectations to snoozefest to firecracker, it has more than delivered. Ignore the distracting \u00a314m price tag \u2013 this has turned into one of the most thrilling shows on TV. And I\u2019ve enjoyed recapping it. Thanks for all your thoughts, cockamamie theories about Alice and Aafrin being replicants, and whatnot. It\u2019s like our own Club, except everyone\u2019s welcome, and I bloody love dogs. Anyway, a second series has been commissioned; I hope they hit the ground running. These characters are starting to get really interesting \u2013 and the concept of milk punch has still not been properly explained. In the final scene, Cynthia and a damned Ralph have a rapprochement in the garden, doomed to each other. \u201cYou\u2019re all I\u2019ve got,\u201d he tells her. \u201cYes,\u201d she growls back, quite pissed. \u201cGood point.\u201d They ascend the stairs together. The establishment has shored up its power, everyone rightfully restored to their wrong place. But there are faultlines, visible and invisible: McLeod without, a Braveheart without portfolio, and Aafrin within, a civil servant who\u2019s feeling neither civil nor servile. When the tremors come, these are the fissures that will surely split Shimla wide open. Creasing up \u201cWho wants a taste of the firing squad?\u201d is what Ralph says when he wants his employees to play cricket with him. Like a 1930s equivalent of \u201cWelcome to the gun show.\u201d Top bantz from Donovan from The Inbetweeners. (I SAID MAYBE.) Singh-le, NSOH, seeks similar Singh is like a be-turbaned Terminator. \u201cWhen did last you see a man run like that,\u201d he asks Aafrin, with absolutely no vocal inflection whatsoever. I hope next series they engineer a situation in which he has to steal someone\u2019s clothes, boots and motorcycle. They grow up so slowly Coffin has a bad week (\u201cI went to the hanging today. I thought it might do me good\u201d). Her nadir is surely being spoonfed rice congee by Kaiser in a high chair, like a six-month-old racist infant. As a youth he wept in butcher\u2019s shops Ronnie Keane is one of the more boring characters, but I did enjoy him divulging: \u201cI have a horror of any sort of broth.\u201d Perhaps they should explore this Uncle Monty-ish side to his character? They\u2019ll always have Mas Dam \u201cDo you remember, sir?\u201d asks Aafrin fondly, handing Ralph a memorandum on the Mas Dam project, as though it\u2019s a photo of them in Paris 20 years ago. Unless they\u2019re saying maasdam, and are actually planning a cheeseboard. They don\u2019t serve it in half measures Maybe milk punch is a metaphor for white violence? \u201cAfter political emancipation, a country\u2019s psyche can spend far longer recovering from the milk punch of colonialism.\u201d What? I should keep these theories to myself?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
