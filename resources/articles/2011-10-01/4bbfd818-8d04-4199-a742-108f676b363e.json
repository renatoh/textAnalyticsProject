UK retail sales volumes over the three months to September slipped 0.2% as shops suffered in August in particular after riots across England. Official data on Thursday also underlined fears that rising inflation is forcing shoppers to cut back on how much they buy. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said sales were up an annual 5.4% in value terms in September, but just 0.6% in volume. After dire reports from the high street, including a 94% crash in profits at Argos, there was little to buoy up retailers in the official data. \"Even the slightest growth is good to see in these times but the combination of high inflation and last year's VAT rise means there is little real growth here,\" said Stephen Robertson, the British Retail Consortium's director general. \"Christmas has always been the most important time for retail but this year is going to be particularly critical.\" While September saw stronger sales volumes than economists had been expecting, there were few indications it marked the start of a turnaround for retailers. The ONS said much of that growth was down to laptop sales at the start of the academic year and a boost to video game sales from a number of new releases. Clothes sales fell, however, as the unseasonally warm weather hit demand for autumn wear. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, was downbeat: \"A quick look at the data for previous months is enough to erode any hopes of a recovery on the high street. Spending over the summer months was revised down, meaning we are seeing an even weaker trend in spending than previously thought.\" \"Retailers are facing a challenging lead-up to Christmas and the festive season may be one of the toughest yet that we've seen in recent memory.\" There are more warning signs for retailers in a report on Friday indicating consumer confidence fell for the fourth month in a row in September. Mortgage lender Nationwide's latest confidence balance of 45 is four points above an all-time low in February. \"These relatively downbeat findings are understandable given the challenging economic backdrop. The economy has hardly grown in 2011 and pressure has continued to mount on household budgets,\" said Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist. The strains on consumer spending \u2013 which makes up two-thirds of GDP \u2013 were laid bare this week as inflation hit 5.2% in September, 5.6% on the retail prices index measure, more than twice the average pay growth. Unemployment is at its highest level for 17 years and business surveys suggest firms are reluctant to start hiring again with stalling growth at home and a debt crisis in big export markets. Companies also complain that they cannot expand without more available credit. The Bank of England's latest data on Thursday showed subdued lending to businesses and it reported credit conditions were tighter for small and medium-sized enterprises than for larger corporates. Opposition MPs and trade unions argue that with so much pressure on growth and jobs, the government's austerity drive is proving self-defeating. Before the latest public sector finances data on Friday, the TUC argued that the cuts had created a \u00a33bn black hole in the government's coffers. The TUC said its analysis of official figures showed that between April and August 2011 rising unemployment and faltering economic growth left tax revenues running a third below the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast in March 2011, while social security spending was a third above it. Lost tax revenues (\u00a31.8bn) and high social security spending (\u00a31bn) accounted for \u00a32.8bn of the government's \u00a35bn overspend so far this financial year, the TUC said. \"Getting people back into work is the only way to get consumers spending again, businesses growing and the deficit down,\" said TUC general secretary Brendan Barber."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
