Survivors clung to the inside of the Russian-built jet as the accident happened at a height of 10,000 metres (33,000 ft). Kikaya Bin Karubi, a Congolese government spokesman, said that seven people had been confirmed killed after being \"ejected from the plane\" near the southern city of Mbuji-Mayi. He added that military helicopters were searching the area for signs of further casualties. Two officials at the international airport in the capital, Kinshasa, independently told the Associated Press that 129 people were feared to have died. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity. After the accident occurred, around 45 minutes into the flight, the pilots managed to turn back and land the plane in Kinshasa, Irung Awan, the defence minister, said. Passengers on the aircraft had included police, soldiers from a presidential guard unit and their families. Nine survivors were being treated for minor injuries and psychological trauma at Kinshasa General Hospital, Kabamba Mbwebwe, chief doctor at the hospital's emergency ward, said. \"They were traumatized and spoke of their baggage flying everywhere,\" Mr Mbwebwe told the Associated Press. \"The door opened and the plane depressurised.\" He said survivors had told him that many people had been sucked out of the aircraft, but that it was not possible to give a precise number. Many of those who survived the accident had suffered head injuries from baggage that flew around inside the aircraft after the door had burst open. Survivor Prudent Mukalayi, a soldier, said that he had escaped because he became jammed against luggage. \"I think there were about 200 people on board, soldiers and their families, women and children,\" he said. \"I was asleep and then I heard people screaming. When I woke up, the pilot told everyone to get to the front of the plane, and there were about 40 of us, but people kept dying ... there were only about 20 survivors.\" The plane, a privately owned Ilyushin 76, had apparently been heading to the south-eastern city of Lubumbashi. Weather conditions were believed to have been normal, and there was little immediate idea of why the door had come open. Witnesses who had been at the airport before the flight took off told reporters that the aircraft had looked \"run down\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
