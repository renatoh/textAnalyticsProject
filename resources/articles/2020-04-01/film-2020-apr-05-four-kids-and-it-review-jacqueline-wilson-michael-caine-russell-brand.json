The Psammead is a lop-eared, trash-hoarding grouch, with the wisdom of the ages and the voice of a used car salesman. The voice, provided by Michael Caine, is the issue: too distinctive, too distracting, too geezerish to sit comfortably in the squat, hairy form of an ancient mystical creature, it drains what magic there is out of this workmanlike fantasy. The Psammead would rather bury his head in the sand than grant wishes to the kids \u2013 and you can\u2019t exactly blame him. These children are not over-endowed with personal charm. Worse, however, is Tristan (Russell Brand), the local toff who lives in a clifftop mansion entirely decorated with bits of endangered species, and who has set his sights on adding the Psammead to his collection. This should amuse the younger members of the family, but it\u2019s unlikely to offer much more to parents than a couple of hours\u2019 respite. \u2022 Four Kids and It is available on Sky Movies"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
