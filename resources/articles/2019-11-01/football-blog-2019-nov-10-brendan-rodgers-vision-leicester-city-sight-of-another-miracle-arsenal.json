Only eight and a half months had passed since he joined Leicester City but the 90 minutes everyone had just witnessed felt among the most significant of that time. Leicester had just outmanoeuvred Arsenal, their claim to a Champions League spot looking increasingly hard to resist, and the atmosphere around the stadium bore resemblance to the near-disbelieving euphoria that helped sweep them to the title in 2016. \u201cI felt the opportunity to hook into an emotion here for a number of reasons,\u201d Rodgers said. Four months before his arrival the architect of Leicester\u2019s lifetime high, the club\u2019s owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, was killed in a tragic helicopter crash outside the ground. At that time Leicester, under Claude Puel\u2019s management, were still trying to navigate the shift in landscape that came with topping the league. They were struggling for a fresh identity and it was a devastating blow to lose the leader regarded by so many as \u201cThe Possible Man\u201d. \u201cIt must have been so difficult for Claude and everyone around the team because I felt the great values and the light [Srivaddhanaprabha] brought this club were blocked,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cI felt I could maybe come in and bring that light into the team again, and use that legacy he left in a really positive way.\u201d The line was a nice one, sensitively delivered, and brought to mind a briefing Rodgers had given journalists a few metres down the corridor during his first week in charge. Back then he said: \u201cIt just feels \u2026 as if I have been here longer. With everyone, with the connection.\u201d He was convinced the fit felt right from the start, and nobody would disagree now. Rodgers has always been good for a soundbite, of course, but criticism of him in the past has tended to play the man rather than the ball. Opponents of his Leicester team have a relatable issue now: most of them spend large periods of a game chasing shadows as the spherical object is manipulated around them, or find themselves caught dozing as the Foxes\u2019 front six hunt in packs. Even accounting for the excellence of Liverpool and Manchester City, it is hard to pinpoint a better-balanced unit in the top flight; nor a manager who has been able to instil his vision with such clarity in a time frame this narrow. It was instructive, in his analysis of Saturday evening\u2019s 2-0 win, to hear Rodgers\u2019 reasoning for introducing Demarai Gray on the hour. At that point the game appeared to be anyone\u2019s and Arsenal could hold legitimate hope of at least stopping their rot with a point. \u201cWe became too \u2018basketball\u2019 and that\u2019s not how we play,\u201d Rodgers said of the second half\u2019s early stages. That kind of slippage from the \u201chow\u201d could not be tolerated so Gray was brought on to get Leicester back up the pitch and, 15 vastly improved minutes later, they had scored twice. \u201cIt\u2019s just having an idea and a plan beforehand of how the game might evolve; then, when you\u2019re in the game, you have to make the quick decisions,\u201d he explained. What would Arsenal give, at this point, for a manager with Rodgers\u2019 lucidness? Their embattled head coach, Unai Emery, did not make a substitution until the game had been lost. There is a growing sense they missed the boat in 2018, when Rodgers would surely have been receptive to an approach after Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s departure was made clear. Leicester\u2019s opening goal on Saturday, a patient buildup of passes that sped up as it reached the box, culminating in a dazzling flick from Harvey Barnes and an ice-cool assist for Jamie Vardy by Youri Tielemans, would have blended into the scenery at Highbury and the Emirates until Wenger\u2019s final few years. Instead Arsenal were reduced to counterattacks \u2013 a gameplan that at least looked logical \u2013 for the majority of the night. Ricardo Pereira said afterwards that is was \u201ca sign things are going well, teams show respect for us\u201d. Jonny Evans made a similar point, saying Leicester had needed to come up with a more assertive way of playing because they could not trade forever on catching teams napping as they did four seasons ago. That mistake is rarely made now; the problem is that few can live with the personality Rodgers has forged. \u201cI think \u2026 the club have been trying to change, because they know it\u2019s hard to sustain the kind of style they had,\u201d said Evans, who played against them for West Bromwich Albion that year. \u201cI think teams disrespected Leicester that season, in terms of not really realising how good they were, and kept being caught short.\u201d While Mesut \u00d6zil spent the final moments being chastised by his teammate Matteo Guendouzi for shirking a 50-50 challenge, the home side\u2019s playmaker and second goalscorer, James Maddison, was continuing to comb every blade of grass. With Wilfred Ndidi and Tielemans, Maddison caps the most exciting midfield three in the country. Their snap off the ball and control after winning it \u2013 the outstanding Ndidi showed both in the buildup to Maddison\u2019s strike \u2013 are formidable and the composure with which Leicester pick their passes around the area resembles that of a team far longer in the making. To a small degree, that is what Leicester are. In Vardy, Kasper Schmeichel and the nowadays background presence of Wes Morgan, Rodgers inherited big personalities who were well aware of what it had taken to create history here. He needed to help them awaken that residual knowledge and graft it on to his long-term plan. \u201cMy idea was to open up the minds of the players and say: \u2018Listen, you did achieve it [winning the league], and I\u2019ll tell you why you didn\u2019t go on and sustain it\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re here to try and create something that can be sustainable, and that\u2019s about your mind as well as your quality.\u201d Leicester are a point better off than at this stage in 2015-16. The light really is back, both for them and for Rodgers. Meanwhile, a few bulbs might belatedly be going off in the minds of those Arsenal executives who passed over him in their hour of need."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
