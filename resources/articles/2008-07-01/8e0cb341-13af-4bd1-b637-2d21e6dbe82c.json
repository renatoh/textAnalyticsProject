I panic she or I got the time wrong. Another waitress says: 'I heard her say something about an interview. This is where she always sits - why don't you wait?' So I sit in Moore's usual corner banquette. The perfect seat for observing and not being seen. Eventually a flustered, 'Oh my God, I'm so-o-o sorry' Moore arrives. She's wearing white crumpled trousers with a black stripe, Converse and a white T-shirt. No make-up on her Celtic alabaster skin, her red hair thick and vivid. Touching my arm with pleading eyes, she's so sweet, so familiar and so sorry. I admire her rings. Broad diamond bands. One spells out the names of Cal, her 10-year-old boy, and Liv, her five-year-old daughter. The other spells out something I can't make out. 'It's my wedding band.' Yes, but what does it say? 'Ow,' she says, as if I'd just pricked her with a needle. 'Oh. Ow,' she says, a hint of a grimace. Is it something rude, I ask, as I see the alabaster turn the colour of a pink grapefruit. 'No. It's not rude at all, it's just personal.' I find the blush about her personal life interesting. Professionally, Moore is known to be one of the most fearless of actors. In The End of the Affair her love scene with Ralph Fiennes was so urgent and unbridled it had to be cut from the US version. She played a porn star in Boogie Nights, appeared naked from the waist down for Robert Altman in Short Cuts, and in her new film Savage Grace she plays the deeply troubled, deeply crazy Barbara Daly who, in her cerise Chanel suit, seduces her son Antony. On the sofa. She does manage to keep her clothes on, but when I saw it she managed to open the mouths of the entire audience as they blinked in disbelief at what they were seeing. Savage Grace tells the true story of Barbara Daly. She was born in the Twenties to a poor family, and her charisma was such that she snared the heir to the Bakelite fortune, Brooks Baekeland. They drank martinis, went to the Stork Club in Manhattan and summered in Paris and southern Spain - until Baekeland left her for his son's girlfriend. She became more tragic; her son became embroiled with his lonely mother. He eventually stabbed her to death when she was 51. Director Tom Kalin wanted Moore not just because of her physical similarity to Daly, but because of 'Julianne's ability to reveal emotion through the smallest moment of behaviour'. All the classic Moore roles have all been about tiny expressions of huge feeling. Far from Heaven, The Hours and The End of the Affair were about characters trying to hide what drives them. 'What is interesting is that in Savage Grace, Barbara had no boundaries. She didn't know where Barbara ended and the world began,' says Moore. 'She was probably bipolar and an alcoholic; her brother and father committed suicide. I always wanted to have a sense that she felt people were watching her, but underneath had no sense of identity. No sense of happiness. In real life, monsters are not six-legged; they are regular people.' Moore nervously toys with a glass of Perrier and fruit juice, pouring one into the other but not really drinking either. She's rather self-conscious: a fearful person who didn't learn to drive till she was 26, swim till she was 27, have her first child till she was 37, 10 years ago. I wonder why she's drawn to highly emotional, dark and sometimes tortured characters. 'I don't know exactly. I think it's to do with being alive. With Barbara, all her emotions were big. Even if they were bad, they were big. When she is most at the edge, she is most alive. I don't know if that's what I'm like, but I know I'm drawn to it. I think I'm normal and practical but I...' Her voice drifts, not so much as if she is looking for the words, but as if she is deciding whether or not to find them. 'For instance, I don't get angry easily, but when I get angry I get very, very, very angry.' She is obsessive compulsive, by her own admission. She used to do the 'lucky walk', leaving the house at a certain time, at a certain pace, so that there would be green lights rather than red. 'Those are the indulgences you can have before you have children. Now I don't have time to obsess. All that stuff about, \"I need to go this certain way and do that,\" was an indulgence of my youth.' In the past year she has worked on two movies, a supernatural thriller, Shelter, and Fernando Meirelles's Blindness, in which all the world goes blind except for her. She says how wonderful it was when the Blindness cast got together again for the Cannes premiere in May. Is it hard to bond so tightly with a group and know your paths may never cross again? 'Yes,' she says, sounding as if it isn't hard at all. 'But that's just what happens.' She feels she slots into the bonding and moving on because her childhood was nomadic. Her father was a lawyer for the army. Before she was 18 they moved 23 times across America and then finally to Germany; she went to nine schools. 'Travelling childhoods are a common theme among actors. Army kids, embassy kids, travelling salesmen, clergy. Thing is, you learn about behaviour, that different places are separated by behaviours which are culturally driven. Most kids will have a different experience because they think behaviour is what it is - unchanging.' She discovered all those years ago that she could change her surface and her expressions in order to fit and blend in: 'It made it harder to get to know me. You'd have to spend a lot of time with me before I'd be comfortable enough to show my dark side.' Today there's not a hint of darkness. It's hard to place her accent - she talks very quickly - or pin her down in any way. Much has been made of the fact she seems so European: her acting is subtle, her colouring Celtic. When she was growing up, her Scottish mother used to tell her: 'Remember, you are not an American.' Something which has served her well over the years. She can very easily be 'not an American', but at the same time you wouldn't think she was anything else. Exuberant and covert in equal parts, she bows her head slightly when she tells me: 'My mother had a hard time letting go of her Scottish accent. It finally went when her mother died because she didn't have any contact with it any more.' Do you identify with Scottish things? Do you like tartan? Do you eat porridge? 'I lo-o-ove tartan,' she beams. 'And porridge is not bad. I love going to Scotland. My grandfather did a very interesting thing when he came to the States. [He emigrated after the war because he was a shipbuilder and needed work.] They lived in New Jersey and he planted his lawn with thick sod that grows well in Scotland, but in New Jersey it was never great. They had a trellis with roses, statues of deer and a birdbath. It never looked right. I didn't understand it - and then I went to Scotland and everyone had spongy grass, climbing roses and deer in their garden. It broke my heart, really, that he was trying to replicate it and it didn't fit. In fact, it's going to make me cry right now, thinking about it.' Her eyes fill up and she starts talking faster. She takes a bathroom break and comes back with her hair pulled back and loosely knotted, and she's applied spidery mascara, which instead of making her look more made up makes her look less so, as the rest of her by contrast to the dark lashes is even more pale. Her parents wed when they were 19 and 20 and had an enduring marriage. She says her childhood 'gave me a great sense of the globe. When I was 16, I was in high school in Germany, which was a great time to be in Europe [the mid-Seventies].' She wore glasses until then, before getting contact lenses. She says: 'I had glasses - no one thought I was terribly attractive. And suddenly I had contacts and everyone thought I was pretty, but I was the same person perceived as pretty.' She shrugs about the incongruity of it. 'Later on I was supposed to play Yelena in Vanya, who'd been described as the most beautiful woman in the world. I was having a hard time with this, but my agent said: \"You just have to be the most beautiful woman in the room, and there are only four women in the play. One is a young girl, one is an elderly nurse and one is the older mother.\" So that's the trick about beauty. The first time you see somebody, that's the only time you see their face. After that what you see is the association you have with them.' A pragmatic attitude that works for a 47-year-old actress with extremely good skin. 'I don't know why women do Botox. It doesn't make them look younger, it just makes them look like they had work done. You are not going to look the same as you did at 25. What are you going to do about it?' Then she softens. 'It's hard for actresses. Our faces get to be blown up 50ft wide, and you see stuff that otherwise you wouldn't. People freak out. The other day I noticed these.' She points to imperceptible lines between her eyebrows. 'I never used to have lines here.' You still don't. 'Yes, but if I go like this...' She screws her nose up to make tiny lines. 'I can get very distracted by it.' I stare right at her: the clear eyes, the top-heavy, recently applied mascara, the paleness, the freckles. As a kid she had a nickname which she hated: Freckleface Strawberry. 'In the Sixties there was a powdered drink [Thirst Fighters] and that was its name. There was also Goofy Grape flavour. At the time I thought it was a terrible nickname, but now that I'm grown up it doesn't seem so bad.' Especially not now the once-hated nickname has provided the title for the illustrated children's book she wrote last year. 'I wrote the book about this little girl trying to get rid of her freckles. I still have mine and I still don't like them, but I have other things to worry about. I care about it less.' She's just written a sequel, but says it's not about her. 'She's more like my little girl. She is much spunkier than I was.' Moore easily slips into talking about her kids. 'It's so nice to have a boy and a girl. I am lucky lucky lucky.' She says it with a subtle sense of wonderment. 'I always tell my little girl that I can remember lying in the bathtub when I was pregnant, and I say I wished and wished for a girl and got her.' She married writer-director Bart Freundlich in 2003, with their son Cal as ring bearer and Liv, who was just a toddler, in a white dress. They met in 1995 when he approached her in a hotel lobby at the Sundance Film Festival to appear in one of his films, The Myth of Fingerprints. At the time she was going through what appeared to be a gruelling divorce from actor John Gould Rubin, whom she married when she was 22. When the marriage broke down she had therapy, trying to reconnect with herself. And that was when she connected with Freundlich. 'It wasn't instant. It built up when we were working together and we didn't want it to end. We opted to continue,' she says, sweeping into an analytical, crisp mode. Was there a knowingness when you first started to work together that it was going to develop into something more? 'No, not at all - I was very focused on my work,' she says super crisply. It's been said before that her career took off after she met him because she stopped focusing on - obsessing over - her work. She relaxed and let it all happen. What made her suddenly so open? 'It's incredibly hard to say. It's...' Her face is now the colour of a raspberry. I pick her up on her blushing, and she laughs. Her husband is nine years younger. Much is always made of the older woman/younger man connection. She pooh-poohs any conversation about that. 'It's about the connection with the person. I have women friends who are significantly younger and older than me. It's not about cultural references, it's about who you are. And I've been on both sides of it.' Her first husband was 10 years older. 'There have only been two husbands,' she is quick to point out. 'There's a guy who claims to have been married to me when I was in college, but I've never met him. Never Google yourself. I Googled a dress that I wore once and it was terrible, people saying, \"I hate that dress,\" \"I love that dress.\"' But the real husband - is she still in touch with him? 'It was a long time ago. It was 1993.' She looks very uncomfortable. 'No, we didn't stay in touch. It was such a long time ago.' She pauses for another uncomfortable moment, knowing that the 'long time ago' made her sound even more uncomfortable. She composes herself when I ask if it was hard to get over it. 'Everything becomes a part of who you are. You are the sum of your experience,' she says. She's giving off an air of someone who was really bruised by it. 'You can't have experience without residue. Anyway, are you in touch with your exes? Are you friends with them?' she asks. I tell her I'm not, and she laughs with relief. Quite a gurgling, full laugh. She worked with Freundlich again on the urban comedy Trust the Man in 2005. 'It's intimate when you're working with someone who knows you well, because they can tell stuff about you that others can't.' She grins as if being known is both a pleasure and a torture. 'The hardest part of working together, though, is the kids. If we are both away it can be rough. My friend Ellen Barkin gave me the best pieces of advice. She said: \"Don't go back to work for as long as you possibly can. Sit on the couch with the remote in one hand and the baby in the other. The whole adjustment is so enormous, and you are never going to get that time back.\" And she also said: \"Never carry a diaper bag, because it makes you look terrible. Put them in your purse.\"' Moore is so pragmatic I wonder about a recent interview in which she supposedly said: 'All actresses are permanently hungry' and that she lived off breakfast cereal and granola bars. Having met her, it doesn't seem to be likely. Her frame is slight and she's slim, but she's certainly not scarily thin. 'Thank you for realising that. I made a couple of jokes about dieting. It was all taken out of context. The interview was on the phone, so the woman didn't even meet me. I am never talking to them again. I didn't say any of that about granola bars.' Is she comfortable in her own body? 'Oh, I wouldn't go so far as to say that,' she laughs. Does she think there's a cut-off age for appearing naked on screen? 'Well, I've done plenty of nudity and I always say if that's the story that's fine, if it's part of a love story - or in Blindness: though it's not a film about sexuality it's about people and bodies, so there is some nudity. I try not to worry about it or think that there's any limit. But as for actually being comfortable in my own skin, I don't think anybody is. I think that, as I was saying before, behaviour is mutable - I think that identity is mutable. Sometimes you think: \"This is who I want to be\" and you feel good about it, you feel attractive. But it's not possible to feel good about yourself at all times,' she says with a tiny flicker of vulnerability, not so much as to make you think she is neurotic or insecure but just so that you know she's human. Do you think those kinds of overtly sexualised women you like to play might come to an end at a certain age? 'I try not to see the boundaries in anything. You try to find a way to be comfortable in the chaos. Ultimately what it comes down to isn't age but physical breaking down, and we are all scared of that.' She looks at me, and I notice the line she pointed out earlier between her eyebrows. Perhaps she's knitting her brow for emphasis. 'I don't want it to end. Nobody does.' We talk about ageing. Not in a sense of becoming less beautiful, but watching people literally break down. I tell her about my father's Alzheimer's. She says quietly: 'You are going to make me cry.' She could be on the brink of tears. She resolves it by one of those very full, throaty laughs. We change the subject. We talk about her son, who got carsick and threw up on the sidewalk. We talk about how she's looking forward to a long summer break, a beach house and lots of books. She seems to need the time to connect with herself again. For Blindness, her trademark red hair was cut conservatively and dyed blonde. 'I couldn't wait to get back to my normal colour.' Did you find that people didn't recognise you when you were blonde, that you blended in? 'Oh no, the opposite. I got so much attention I couldn't stand it,' she says, and it's time for her to go. With that, she gets up from her corner banquette at the bistro, that perfect seat for observing and not being seen, and leaves before anyone notices her \u00b7 Savage Grace is released on 11 July"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
