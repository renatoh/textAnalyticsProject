Had he not been Victor Matfield, he would probably have been doubled up. But the Springbok's acting captain had just played 72 minutes of high\u2011intensity rugby with a rib damaged in the collision that left poor Chris Ashton, the hero of two weeks earlier, wobbling like a new-born lamb. Given a pain-killing injection at half-time, Matfield handed England a lesson in sucking up the hurt and giving it back. Martin Johnson was inclined to bat away suggestions that England went through a learning experience on Saturday. Always disposed to avoid easy excuses, he preferred to look at the game as a single contest and to face the fact that they had just been defeated by a team who finished bottom of the most recent Tri-Nations tournament, had just lost to Scotland, were missing such figures as Fourie du Preez, Schalk Burger, Bryan Habana, Heinrich Brussow and John Smit and whose coach, Peter de Villiers, seems permanently under threat. Against England's predominantly young team, in which only two members of the starting XV, Tom Palmer and Nick Easter, started in the equivalent match two years ago, South Africa turned the Murrayfield humiliation into fuel for a display impressive enough to suggest that another World Cup final appearance is not out of the question in Auckland next October. What Johnson learnt is that he has 10 months and not even that many matches in which to harden his players sufficiently to compete with the very best. A 50% win record in this autumn's international series shows England to be a long way still from attaining the omnipotence of Johnson's own playing days, and the reduction of Ashton's potency and the departures of Tom Croft and Toby Flood before half-time emphasised the relative slenderness of their resources in terms of top-level talent. Yet they are unquestionably making progress. \"Martin Johnson got two things right,\" De Villiers said last night. \"He got the self-belief of the team back where it should be. You can see when the players run on to the pitch and when they carry the ball that their passion and confidence is back. They want to do it. He also got the players to stand up for each other and, by getting a simple game plan going, he made them believe that they can compete with anyone out there. So I think he's made good strides and one loss doesn't make you a bad team.\" English rugby, he said, is \"back on the map\", thus confirming the belief that it had indeed spent a period in the wilderness, and Matfield agreed. \"The one thing that stands out is the character of the team, the belief they've got,\" he said. \"Martin as a person never took a step back and that's what he's instilled in his team.\" Although it was an absorbing game in which both forwards and backs were able to express themselves, Johnson will be thinking hardest in the coming weeks about how England lost their biggest battles up front. The dominance of Matfield, Bakkies Botha and Juan Smith in the line-out was no surprise, particularly after Croft's departure, but they were also out-scrummaged by an all-Sharks front row including the two Du Plessis brothers. \"We did all right,\" Jannie, the elder, said. \"We knew that they're a very good scrummaging pack, so we had to be up for it.\" But he also drew broader conclusions about the way the new interpretation of the breakdown laws is improving the spectacle by eliminating the endless back-and-forth kicking that had begun to disfigure the game by the time the Springboks won the last World Cup, reducing teams to waiting for their opponents to make a mistake. \"The new interpretation, where the benefit of the doubt is with the attacker, is brilliant for the game, and both sides showed tonight that it's the type of rugby they want to play,\" he said. \"If you look at how England have been playing in the autumn series, it's exactly what they've been doing. They've been carrying the ball, Nick Easter has been brilliant at getting them over the advantage line and they can play off there because they've got very exciting and dangerous backs. It came off for us today but it was a great, great rugby game and it was nice to be a part of it.\" Very good, perhaps, rather than truly great but England can feel confident that their momentum is taking them in the right direction. Time, however, is not on their side and they will need a commanding Six Nations performance if they are to entertain realistic hopes of reaching what would be their third successive World Cup final."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
