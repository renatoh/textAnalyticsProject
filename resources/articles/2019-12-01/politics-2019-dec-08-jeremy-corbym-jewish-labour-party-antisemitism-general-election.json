With days to go before Thursday\u2019s general election, Mike Katz, JLM\u2019s chairman, says its members concluded \u201ca while ago that Jeremy Corbyn is not fit to be prime minister\u201d because his party was \u201cfailing its Jewish members and tolerating antisemitism\u201d. Writing for the Observer, Katz adds: \u201cThe Jewish Labour Movement \u2013 a founding affiliate of the party, nearly a century ago \u2013 has for the first time effectively downed tools for the election, campaigning only for exceptional candidates who have been the best of allies to us in our fight against the party\u2019s anti- Jewish racism.\u201d He says he and others have told Corbyn and his team until they are \u201cblue in the face\u201d of the problems and strength of feeling among British Jews, but have been met with \u201cobfuscation, denial and delay\u201d. Scores of serving and former Labour officials have given sworn statements about antisemitism in the party as part of evidence submitted to the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which is investigating the issue. In May this year, the commission announced an inquiry under section 20 of the Equality Act 2006, having carried out preliminary investigations. Last week, final submissions from the JLM to the inquiry were leaked to the media, including 70 sworn testimonies from current and ex-party staffers. These include detailed allegations of antisemitic abuse at party meetings and by members online. The submissions also allege political interference in the disciplinary process by Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s office, despite Labour\u2019s insistence that the leadership has not got involved. In particular, they claim that the supposed separation between the leader\u2019s office and the party\u2019s complaints unit broke down in August 2018 and that a staffer was instructed via WhatsApp to upload complaints on to USB sticks for the leader\u2019s office to examine and make recommendations for future action. In his article, Katz says: \u201cThe witness statements from members show that the all-pervading culture of antisemitism is present in all parts of the party; local party meetings, party conferences, online forums, the disciplinary processes and its officials.\u201d On Tuesday, Corbyn apologised for antisemitic incidents that involved Labour members and said he was dealing with the issue. \u201cObviously, I\u2019m very sorry for what has happened,\u201d he said after being asked to apologise in an interview on ITV\u2019s This Morning programme."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
