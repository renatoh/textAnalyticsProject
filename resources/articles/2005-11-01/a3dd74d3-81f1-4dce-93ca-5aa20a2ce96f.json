The most significant is at No10, where Mat Rogers takes over responsibility for running the backline from Matt Giteau, having performed the role with some success in the final Tri-Nations game against New Zealand. Wendell Sailor has also been axed, giving the Wallabies a more youthful look out wide. Up front the 22-year-old Queensland lock Hugh McMeniman makes his first Test start in place of Mark Chisholm while John Roe is preferred to Rocky Elsom in the back row. \"What I like about Mat at five-eighth is that he is so enthusiastic about playing there and will give us something a little bit different,\" Jones said. \"You need that to break down defences. He had a good game at fly-half against New Zealand and finished there against France.\" Australia: Latham (Queensland); Gerrard (ACT), Tuqiri (NSW), Turinui (NSW), Mitchell (Queensland); Rogers (NSW), Gregan (ACT, capt); Dunning (NSW), Cannon (WA), Baxter (NSW), Sharpe (WA), McMeniman (Queensland), Roe (Queensland), Waugh (NSW), Smith (ACT).
