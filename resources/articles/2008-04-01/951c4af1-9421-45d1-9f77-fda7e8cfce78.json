Two English clubs, both with home advantage, have proved unable to prevent a French-Irish Heineken Cup final. Given that English sides have lifted five of the past eight European titles, a Toulouse-Munster finale in Cardiff is hardly a dream ticket from a Guinness Premiership perspective. The English, at best, may supply the referee or possibly the television match official. If nothing else, it bucks the continental trend in post-World Cup years. In both 2000 and 2004 English clubs emerged triumphant. Instead Munster are now striving to conquer Europe for the second time in three seasons and Toulouse hope to succeed where Biarritz failed two years ago. To compound matters, English representation in next season's tournament will now be cut from seven to six clubs. Talk about rubbing salt into gaping wounds. So much - from a Magners League perspective - for the claim that the Premiership is now the best domestic competition in the world. If the latter were true, surely there would be an English team in the final, if not two? The obvious English rejoinder is that Welsh and Scottish players are also conspicuously absent. To which the Welsh are entitled to wave their grand slam flags or, alternatively, two fingers. Such is life on an overpopulated small island where nationalistic gestures remain so prevalent. Amid the English gloom, however, it is entirely reasonable to argue that the Premiership is actually on the up. A couple of seasons ago there is no way either Saracens or London Irish would have reached the last four. These are two sides sitting eighth and seventh respectively in the Premership table who stand no realistic chance of playing Heineken Cup rugby next season. If supposed mid-table fodder can perform that well, how good are the top six? The answer is increasingly vibrant, with the exception of Leicester, who have been out of sorts. Bath were outstanding in crushing Sale in the European Challenge Cup semi-final and Wasps have played some exhilarating rugby lately. It just so happens Lawrence Dallaglio and co were edged out in the most competitive European pool of the lot, and Bath were not even involved. It is one of Dallaglio's biggest bugbears that the third Irish province waltz into the competition without any strings attached whereas the English sides must claw their way in. Would Ulster have beaten Bath or Sale in a pre-qualifying two-leg play-off? Not this season. Even Worcester, sitting 11th in the table, are coming good. If they beat Bath in the Challenge Cup final at Kingsholm on May 25 they are set to join Gloucester, Bath, Wasps and two from Harlequins, Sale and Leicester in next season's Heineken Cup. Mike Ruddock, Worcester's director of rugby, believes the English clubs will not be subdued for long. \"The Guinness Premiership is a very tough league and every game is of European Cup standard,\" he said. \"The people I've spoken to this year say they've seen some of the best rugby in the Premiership they've ever seen.\" Ruddock, of course, previously coached Wales; overseas players and coaches can swiftly blur parochial boundary debates. Both Saracens and Irish reached the last four under Australian directors of rugby; Saracens had an inspirational South African captain; and Irish's equally influential Bob Casey is hardly a product of the Rugby Football Union academy. In that narrow sense there must be some concern: Martin Johnson is no stranger to the art of leadership and will already have noted a relative lack of indomitable English-qualified captains out there. England's big clubs, though, will bounce back, hungrier and more determined than ever. Out of love and out of touch The International Rugby Board are set to vote this Thursday on whether to proceed with its much-discussed Experimental Law Variations. If you fancy having your say in the meantime, the Rugby Football Union has set up a website - www.rfusurvey.co.uk - with the aim of canvassing views. IRB representatives, for their part, briefed the media at the weekend about the need to embrace the various law changes. Their argument was seriously undermined within a matter of hours by two outstanding Heineken Cup semi-finals which reflected the sport in all its multi-dimensional glory. One would have assumed, in the circumstances, that the IRB's chief executive Mike Miller would have been present at Twickenham on Saturday afternoon to watch the London Irish-Toulouse game. Instead those with sharp eyes swear they spotted him at Chelsea v Manchester United, sitting near Fabio Capello. This week's question: is it still possible in 2008 to be a senior figure within the IRB and have no particular love of professional rugby? Discuss. It's not all about speed Glad to see Dwain Chambers avoided getting killed in Castleford. But before the former sprinter decides to try his luck at rugby union he may like to consider the following list: Tom Varndell, Topsy Ojo, Richard Haughton, Miles Benjamin, Tom Voyce and Ugo Monye. All of them are lightning-quick English-qualified wingers who actually know how to play rugby and cannot, as yet, make their national team. If 'Cas' are genuinely seeking the next big thing they are looking in the wrong place."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
