When you're not balancing your eight ashtangic limbs in the comfort of stylish mud huts and tipis, you'll be taught basic ways to save energy in the home, recycle household rubbish and grow organic food on a roof terrace. For the more ambitious, the centre also runs a practical eco-building course, including building with adobe clay bricks and assembling composting toilets. The week-long courses, which include yoga sessions, begin in May and cost \u00a3325pp, including full-board and tuition, but not flights. EasyJet flies Gatwick-Malaga from \u00a356 return, from where you can take a 90-minute bus ride to El Burgo, 9km from El Convento. \u00b7 00 34 690 681 068, ashtangaom.com. Low-cost fly and walk If you're a fan of pre-arranged independent walking holidays but prefer to book the travel arrangements yourself, a new website could be just the ticket. Independent walking holiday specialist Inntravel has launched youwalk.com through which you can book breaks in Spain, Italy, Austria and Switzerland. According to Inntravel's David Quick, \"Millions of people want to book their own low-cost flights from near where they live, not from London or Manchester, yet they want something arranged for them at the other end.\" All walks listed on the website are near airports served by low-cost airlines or can be reached by train. The itinerary and accommodation of Inntravel's self-guided walking holidays are arranged prior to the trip and your luggage is carried for you between hotels. For example, one week's walking holiday in the Costa Brava costs \u00a3345pp, including six-nights' B&amp;B and four dinners. Ryanair flies to nearby Gerona from Blackpool, Bournemouth, East Midlands, Glasgow Prestwick, Liverpool, Luton and Stansted. \u00b7 youwalk.com. Tourists make way for turtles The Malaysian government has shut the tourist resort on the island of Sipadan, off the south-east coast of Borneo, following concern from conservationists that light pollution is disturbing the island's turtles. One of Jacques Cousteau's top-10 dive sites, Sipadan is renowned for the high numbers of green and hawksbill turtles, as well as for its rich marine life. Divers will still be allowed to explore Sipadan's reef, but they will have to be based on one of the nearby resorts. Dive Worldwide is offering an 11-day diving trip to the nearby island resort of Kapalai for \u00a31,534, with optional day excursions to Sipadan, including Heathrow flights, full board and diving equipment for three dives a day. \u00b7 0845 1306980, diveworldwide.com. Country cuisine Nerina Keeley Mureddu, whose family owns Cousine Island, the eco-reserve in the Seychelles, is trailblazing luxury eco-friendly agriturismo in Tuscany. Il Borghetto di Chiena opens in May in the hilltop town of Reggello, 20km from Florence.

A black and white issue Spare a thought on Valentine's Day for the not-so-lucky-in-love giant pandas of China. Isolated in the bamboo mountain forests, the pandas are undergoing an artificial insemination programme to help boost their low population. Join a conservation expedition to the giant panda reservation in Shaanxi province, home to a quarter of the world's population of the threatened bears - just 270. A four-week placement, which runs throughout the year, costs \u00a31,395pp with full-board and a TEFL course, but not flights. \u00b7 08000 111156, i-to-i.com. And finally... B&amp;Bs across the land, from medieval Scottish castles to Kent country cottages, are turning to organic produce to woo their increasingly eco-concious guests. Over half the 700 B&amp;Bs in Alastair Sawday's Special Places To Stay guidebook, have agreed to include organic, home grown or locally sourced food on their breakfast menus. The publisher is also expecting B&amp;Bs featured in its other guides to Spain and France to sign up to the scheme over the coming year. \u00b7 specialplacestostay.com."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
