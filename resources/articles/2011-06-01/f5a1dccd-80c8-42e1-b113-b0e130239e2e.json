In his late-night Radio 1 slot, the lugubrious DJ would play records by bands who had nothing in them other than a single barbaric yawp; he would provide the first stepping stone for groups who would later achieve greatness; he would offer acts of almost any stripe the chance to showcase their talents in the four-song recordings from the BBC studios in Maida Vale known as Peel Sessions (many of them more memorable than the \"official\" recordings of the same songs). Peel's embrace of indie was the result of a Damascene conversion during 1976/77. Where once he'd been the voice of \"head\" music, punk saw him cast aside his previous musical identity. For proof, look at the first two Festive 50s \u2013 his end-of-year charts \u2013 from 1976 and 1977. The first compiled his listeners' all-time top 50 songs. It was topped by Stairway to Heaven. The following year he picked his own favourite tracks of the year. The Motors were at Nos 1 and 3. Even the Lurkers made No 12."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
