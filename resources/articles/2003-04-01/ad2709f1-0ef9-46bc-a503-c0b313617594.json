The show is a dazzling fusion of African style, cultural identity and 1960s cool. The only problem is that everyone in the gallery is white. The only black face is the gallery attendant. Over at the V&amp;A, it's the same story. There are only three non-Europeans in the crowd at the museum's blockbuster, Art Deco. Given deco's huge stylistic debt to African art, it is a depressing experience. Why are two shows with significant black content failing to reach a wider multicultural audience? Do black and Asian people have completely different tastes in visual art? Do they find the white-walled art gallery too inaccessible or snobbish? Is this even a question we should be asking? The playwright and critic Bonnie Greer thinks it is: 'These institutions, until very recently, have not been \"friendly\" for black people. We haven't felt terribly welcomed there. It's a very old issue and has a lot to do with the West's attitude to people of African descent. There is racism in the fact that assumptions are made - people are excluded by just not including them. But you know black people have always gone to orchestras, libraries, theatre and galleries. We just haven't gone \"in mass\". They aren't seen as things we like to do. I remember when I came over here 17 years ago to teach Shakespeare in inner-city schools, the people who tried to discourage me were white. They didn't see what use Shakespeare could be to the lives of average black people.' As Greer sees it: 'To go to the classical world as a black person is a lonely trawl. That's why I'm so excited to be on the board at the Royal Opera House because I can affect policy at a major cultural institution. We need to be in positions of power to make that happen.' But haven't we moved on from seeing audiences in terms of colour? Not according to the soul singer Beverley Knight. 'There are a lot of assumptions made about the tastes of black people based on weary stereotypes, ie that black people wouldn't be interested in the fine arts or opera, that they only like rhythm and sport. It's about time people of colour were also seen as cerebral.' Knight thinks class is a major issue. 'A huge proportion of us in this country come from immigrant parents, who have worked their way up the social ladder, but no matter where they get to they are still considered working-class. The high arts are very much seen as the preserve of the upper-middle classes, therefore out of reach of most people of colour, full stop. We in this multicultural society have got to start to understand that everything Britain has to offer culturally is diverse in its roots, and because of that it has to be accessible to all. If you take me, for example - young black woman raised in Gosport, making soul music for a mainly pop audience, but also with a great interest in theatre and exhibitions. I remember seeing the Basquiat show at the Serpentine in 1996 and being reduced to tears. And I'm not unique in that. 'Black theatre has always done well. It's very specific to African/Caribbean folklore or even US black folklore. But I'm just as likely to be having a chat with my boyfriend about Bizet's Carmen and then get into my car and turn up the volume on Redman's new album - because as human beings that's what we do. We're all complex, we're not totally defined by our race and colour. I think sometimes we're scared to drift away from the stereotypes, because they've almost become like a safety net.' A year ago, the Eclipse report, published by the Arts Council, pledged to bring about major changes in the opportunities available to Black, Asian and Chinese artists and arts professionals working in English theatres. Last week Baroness Ruth Rendell tabled a motion in the House of Commons ('Combating racism in the performing arts'), voicing concerns expressed by dance and music organisations. A key claim was that programming, marketing and treatment in venues are poorer for ethnic minorities. In London around 30 per cent of the population is classed as being from an ethnic minority - with a disposable income valued at over \u00a312 billion. So that's a lucrative audience to tap - 15 per cent of the RSC's audience at Midnight's Children describe themselves as being South Asian in origin, while the mayor's Get Into Theatre ticket scheme attracted positive ethnic minority figures. Over 13 per cent of those booking on line described themselves as non-white (and that doesn't include phone booking, which first-time buyers tend to use). In fact the GLA brought in specialist ethnic agency, Media Moguls, to market the campaign across the diverse communities. According to Anjna Raheja: 'We targeted all the black and Asian press, TV channels, radio stations and websites. We leafleted community groups and flyered youth gigs. I was really pleased with how many people from an EM background took up the offer. But in the same way the \"white\" community has issues with theatre and ballet as being \u00e9litist - we have issues about it being too posh, too expensive, not for the family. So it's about using outreach work to say, \"Come and experience this.\" It's about going into mother and toddler groups or working out where women go in their spare time and putting leaflets into beauty salons and nail art centres. Barber shops are a traditional haunt for black men, why aren't there leaflets in those places? Traditional forms of advertising and media have to change.' Marc Boothe, a director at the black film marketing consultancy B3, agrees: 'Young black people are very sophisticated at decoding; they recognise when they're being patronised. And ultimately black audiences are not homogeneous, they read books, they're into soaps, they like to have fun. You shouldn't have to dress everything up in politically correct language.' Recently Boothe has been working on audience outreach initiatives for Denzel Washington's film, Antwone Fisher and Spike Lee's 25th Hour. 'Word of mouth with ethnic audiences is really important. The way they receive their information is not necessarily through the critics. If there's a good review they're not interested.' So is the dream to turn a culturally specific project into a mainstream success, without alienating either audience? ' Bend It Like Beckham confounded critics who say British films of colour don't make money,' says Boothe. 'It crossed over and made \u00a312 million. This month, Channel 4 will broadcast a programme about David Beckham as a black icon (Black Like Beckham ). But while Channel 4 boss Mark Thompson, says that they are 'having fun with multicultural issues', Beverley Knight just wants to see an episode of Casualty where the black actor playing the doctor 'doesn't turn out to be part of some evil immigration storyline. It winds me up so much that as soon as you introduce a character of colour, it's like the scriptwriters think automatically, \"Ooh, yes, we must involve the arranged marriage thing, clearly there's going to be a drugs issue, maybe some Yardies...\" Sorry, but not in my household.' Friends may be introducing its first black character after 10 years and BBC3's comedians, 3 Non-Blondes, are taking on cult status, but Bonnie Greer argues that we have fewer black faces on TV than 16 years ago. 'One of the reasons I came over here from America in 1986 was because there was no problem. There was Rising Damp, there was Lenny Henry jumping around. These days we don't get a look in.' So are we reaching a situation where black and white audiences may end up virtually segregated? After all, UK digital radio stations such as Choice FM and Kiss FM and cable channels such as Zee TV were set up as black and Asian audiences grew tired of being underserved by the media. It is also why Bobby Syed set up the Ethnic Multicultural Media Awards (Emma) in 1998. Emma celebrates ethnic diversity and cultural excellence, but it is also a way of shaming the mainstream media. 'Minorities tend to be looked upon as a fashion statement, particularly at a cultural level,' Syed argues. 'Emma isn't about white people accepting black people on their terms, it's about us accepting ourselves and the white community on our terms. The trouble is people cannot handle minorities as being intellectuals. It's very threatening for some people.' Playwright Tanika Gupta admits: 'I'm so fed up with being called an \"Asian playwright\". They would never describe Tom Stoppard as a \"white playwright\", or say \"with an all-white cast\", like they say \"with an all-Asian cast\".' 'It's a complicated and quite loaded situation,' agrees actor and director Josette Bushell-Mingo. 'West Indian families, if the show is good, will go and see something. Of course if there's a black ensemble that might encourage them to come into the theatre. I would encourage black productions but I wouldn't just market them as black productions. Even this conversation is putting me back five years.' Gupta's next adaptation for the Young Vic is a modern Asian reworking of Hobson's Choice. 'This time he's called Hari Hobson instead of Horatio, but I still couldn't bring myself to make it an exclusively Asian play, so two of the daughters are about to get married to white guys - one Jewish, one a local northern lad - because again I thought that's the world I live in, that's what happens.' Gupta believes a lack of black and Asian theatre critics leads to insularity. 'For example in Fragile Land , there's an Afghani chap, there's a mixed-race bloke, two Asian girls, a white chap - it's very mixed. And yet we've had comments like, \"It just seems a bit unreal that these people would hang out together.\" And I thought, well, maybe not in your world.' From White Teeth to Ms Dynamite - arguably the best British art reflects the experience of twenty-first-century urban multiculturalism. After all, terms such as 'native' or 'ethnic' have always been the way the West applies its non-urban, undynamic, ahistorical viewpoint to the rest of the world. As Marc Boothe sees it: 'The important thing to remember is that multiculturalism in the UK does occupy a really unique space. You only realise how valuable that is when you go to the States and see how segmented it is along racial and economic lines. The fact that today's films are representing a certain slice of life of multicultural Britain is so important.'
