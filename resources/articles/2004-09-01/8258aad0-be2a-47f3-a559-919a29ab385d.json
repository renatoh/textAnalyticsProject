This is a big thing in Scotland, and in the drinks industry, where good brands - and Glenmorangie is up there with the best - do not come on the market so frequently. And when one is sold, there is often an outburst of national indignation that another great Scots brand is being handed over to the global giants. So far, that has not been the case with Glenmorangie, although news of its sale - prematurely broken in the business pages a few weeks back - sent a temporary shock through the 111-year sold company. Paul Neep, chief executive for the past seven years, admits: 'It was a surprise to the board, but it was obviously a family decision.' The family in this case is the Macdonald clan, who founded Glenmorangie in 1893 and who have a holding equivalent to just over 50 per cent of the voting shares and one third of the value - making the the 15 or so family members worth something over \u00a3100m. David Macdonald, the 71-year-old family patriarch, could have been portrayed as a betrayer of Scotland's whisky heritage, but in fact he has had a largely sympathetic press. Old hands at Brox burn regret the need for change, but understand why it had to happen: 'If I had the chance of \u00a3100m in the bank I'd sell too,' said one long-term employee. Neep, and his deputy and finance director Iain Hamilton, recognise the reality of the situation: 'At the end of the day, the shareholders decide. And I can see why they'd want to sell now,' says Neep. It was no sudden decision by the Macdonalds. David, who retired as chairman 10 years ago, was the last of the male line of the family who wanted any executive role with Glenmorangie. Of his four daughters, two work for the firm, but not at an executive level. 'He had reached an age where he had to think of how the family wealth would be passed on,' says a financier close to the auction process. With family shareholdings becoming increasingly unpopular with City investors (see below), the Macdonalds really had only one option - to sell their stake - and this would inevitably trigger a change of ownership. Commercial considerations, of course, were high up the Macdonalds' priorities. The shares were approaching all-time-high levels as the markets got the message that Glenmorangie had been transformed under Neep and Hamilton, and was close to achieving 'superbrand' status within the multi-billion-pound Scotch whisky market. It is important to clarify from the outset that Glenmorangie is not just any old whisky, something to have with Coke or lemonade, or to add to the post-prandial coffee. It - and the other big brands in the portfolio, Glen Moray and Ardbeg - are single malts made with loving care at the Tain distillery in Ross-shire. According to the legend, the 16 'men of Tain' still hold the secrets of the distillation process that gives the whisky its characteristic flavour, highly praised by malt aficionados. Malt sales have been rising as 'ordinary' - blended - Scotch sales fell back in the Nineties. With the average age of drinkers getting higher, Scotch had an image problem: it was the drink your parents had in the cabinet, and therefore was not likely to appeal. The marketing slant of the malt whisky makers changed to reflect the unique 'matureness' of the product, and the customer. If you knew your single malts, you were a creature of serious sophistication. Discerning the subtle variations on the malt distilling process - ageing in different kinds of wood and for longer periods before bottling - became a skill similar to that of a wine expert in telling different grapes and vineyards. Take a look through the Glenmorangie annual report to appreciate the marketing technique. The happy-looking drinkers are thirtysomething metropolitans, discerning professionals who appreciate the heritage of single malts and the prestige of the brand. This upmarket strategy was the brainchild of Neep and Hamilton. 'We are focused and brand-driven, and there is a passion and belief inside the company that the brands can work for you,' says Neep. Under their regime, it certainly has worked for Glenmorangie. The eponymous brand this year replaced Glenlivet as the number one single malt in Britain, and it is making serious inroads into foreign markets - the US, Canada, Germany and Scandinavia all have a taste for the malt, while drinkers in Japan and Taiwan are also beginning to develop a liking for it. The Far East was the growth engine for the last great wave of expansion in whisky sales in theNineties, and Neep sees it as the big opportunity for malts too. 'A lot of young Taiwanese are drinking malts - it's an increasingly important area,' he says. So, under new management and with the hiccup of the Nineties behind it, the future looks good for Glenmorangie's business. It looks an attractive asset that in most sectors would command a queue of potential buyers - from the trade, venture capitalists, even management buyouts. But the se rules do not apply to the drinks business. The global spirits industry is dominated by the big international groups - Diageo, Allied Domecq, Brown Forman, Bacardi Martini, Pernod Ricard, and LVMH. Smaller groups such as Glenmorangie need to do deals with these giants to ensure all-important distribution overseas, and this is a decisive factor in the financing of a disposal. Put simply, non-trade buyers - including the management - cannot produce the synergies to make a deal work at the suggested \u00a3300m price-tag. So, despite all their experience and acumen, Neep and Hamilton will not get a chance to mount an MBO. 'It was obvious early on that a management buyout was very unlikely,' says Neep, 'so the priorities became getting the best deal for shareholders, and protecting employment.' There is some uneasiness among Glenmorangie's 360-strong workforce that a big multinational would axe jobs in Scotland and destroy the special relationship has with its workers - the firm was recently voted the second best company to work for in Scotland. But it is not inevitable this would happen. Brown Forman, for example, the American producer of Jack Daniels that has a 10 per cent stake in the Scots firm and distribution agreements all over the world, would not want to destroy the brand value by hacking back its Scots heritage. Of the other possible bidders, Diageo, which dominates the Scotch whisky industry, is probably out of the frame because of its huge market position; Bacardi could emerge as a serious challenge to the giant American, but industry observers believe Allied, LVMH and Pernod are less interested. The outside money is going on CL Financial, a big financial conglomerate that recently moved into wines and distillers. As for price, Glenmorangie's advisers are coy, but \u00a3300m seems eminently achievable. Hamilton is quick to point out that the company's stock of malt and other whiskies - carried on the book at historic cost of \u00a383m, but insured for closer to \u00a3500m - would be worth \u00a3230m on its own if sold on the bulk market. And that leaves out the value of the brand. 'Nobody else in the world can produce Glenmorangie,' says Neep, 'and it's taken us and the Macdonalds 40 years to build the brand. That must be worth a premium.' And what will happen to the duo when the new owner is named? 'We've both got a passionate affection for the business, but we're just employees, like everybody else. We'd love to stay on, but it's not up to us,' says Neep. Hamilton is in full agreement. Why the Macdonald clan want to sell their heritage The Macdonalds, benevolent owners of the Glenmorangie business for 111 years, are the latest example of a trend that has changed the face of British business over the past three decades, and which promises to lead to further transformations in the near future. The City does not like family-controlled companies. And it likes even less family companies with split share structures. For decades, family businesses dominated the stock markets. The Bernsteins, the Pearsons and the Fortes are all examples of families that started firms, floated them, and finally came under pressure to reduce their hold. The Sainsbury family is now feeling the same pressure. Some of them - like the Macdonalds - developed a weighted share structure in which different classes of shares had different voting strengths. At Glenmorangie, the class B shares have five times the voting strength of the more heavily traded class As, giving the Macdonalds majority control. In theory, this could have led to a conflict of interest with the senior management. If the executive board wanted to raise capital or make an expensive acquisition, it would have to go to the market for approval. But the City would be likely to insist on structural changes as a pre-condition of opening the purse-strings. There were other factors peculiar to Glenmorangie, however. David Macdonald, who ran the business until 10 years ago, is father of four daughters, but it appears that none of them wanted an executive role in the traditionally male-dominated Scotch business. At the same time, as advisers explain, he was conscious of his advancing years, and of the firm's advancing share strength. Earlier this year, on behalf of the 15 or so other family members who held shares, he decided the time for a sale had come. It may not be just the Macdonalds who get the benefit of the Glenmorangie windfall. The family's trust, which holds the majority of the shares, is a real charitable institution and may be able to make significantly bigger donations to its favoured causes - mainly cancer research organisations - on the back of a \u00a3100 million sale. As for the Glenmorangie workers, it is still unclear whether or not they will share in the Macdonalds' good fortune - but such an idea has not been ruled out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
