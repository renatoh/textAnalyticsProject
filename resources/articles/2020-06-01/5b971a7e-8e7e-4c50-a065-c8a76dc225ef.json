Despite recent rainfall, a record-breaking spring of sunshine has left many landscapes dry and created the perfect conditions for fires to ignite and quickly spread. Since the start of April, several large blazes have broken out on the trust\u2019s land, including one at Froward Point on the Devon coast that was started by a barbecue and required six fire engines and a police helicopter to extinguish. Woodland and heathland were damaged. Around 2 sq km of land was damaged at Marsden Moor in West Yorkshire, an important site for ground-nesting birds such as the curlew, short-eared owl and merlin. In May, a heathland fire damaged Thurstaston Common on the Wirral peninsula, in north-west England, which is home to lizards, tiger beetles and migrant birds. Prime heathland habitat was lost. At Studland Beach in Dorset, fire crews extinguished 30 unattended barbecues in a single night. There has also been an increase in litter at many sites, which the trust says not only blights the landscape but poses a threat to wildlife and can fuel wildfires. At Dovedale, in the Peak District, volunteers filled 100 bin bags in one weekend. Ben McCarthy, the head of nature conservation at the National Trust, said: \u201cWe know that people have missed the outdoors and open spaces these past few months \u2013 and we\u2019re really pleased to be welcoming them back. \u201cBut we\u2019re urging people not to bring barbecues to the countryside or the coast. They can lead to real problems, particularly after such little rain in April and May. \u201cMany areas of land are still very dry and all it takes is a single spark from a barbecue or a dropped cigarette to cause a serious fire. \u201cFires like these undermine our work to care for nature and respond to the climate emergency, which are priorities for the National Trust.\u201d Incidences of UK wildfires are increasing in number and severity, in part due to changing weather patterns. Last year was particularly worrying for fire services and conservation charities with the unseasonably warm February and Easter contributing to blazes across the country. Among these was a devastating fire on Marsden Moor in April 2019 that destroyed 700 hectares (1,730 acres) of wildlife habitat, including that of the mountain hare, and burned for four days."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
