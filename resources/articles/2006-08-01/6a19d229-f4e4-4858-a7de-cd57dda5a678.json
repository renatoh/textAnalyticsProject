The Australian midfielder returned to Ewood Park after his post-World Cup holiday on Monday to discover that the Riverside club had made an offer for him. Although Emerton was assured that Blackburn's manager Mark Hughes is extremely keen to retain him, Emerton was apparently disappointed that club officials have been trying to urge him to extend a contract which has a year to run. It is understood that Emerton - who only two weeks ago interrupted his holiday to announce that he hoped to stay at Rovers until his deal expires - intended to let his contract run out and thereby leave the club on a Bosman free transfer. Understandably Blackburn are anxious not to lose an international midfielder of only 27 who cost \u00a32.5m from Feyenoord three years ago. They have been led to believe that Boro will pay at least \u00a32m. Boro's chief executive Keith Lamb lodged a bid some weeks ago only to be told Rovers would be offering him a new contract. Now aware he has no intention of signing, Boro were last night hoping for a phone call inviting them to talk to him. Sunderland's manager Niall Quinn is interested in bringing Kevin Phillips back from Aston Villa if the opportunity arises. The Irishman is preparing a side for a Championship promotion challenge and admits his old team-mate would be a useful addition to the squad, although he concedes he would wait for the outcome of the takeover talk at Villa Park if necessary. \"I've made a couple of inquiries about Kevin but the situation at Aston Villa is that nothing is happening until the situation is resolved,\" Quinn said. \"Kevin is someone who I don't think would come here and play 46 games scoring 30 goals. But in terms of standards of professionalism he is a guy who in training is the most impressive man I have ever worked with. \"To have him around the place would be special but he is an Aston Villa player. If he ever did become available, then hopefully he would want to come.\" Quinn added that he is not in the race to sign the Sheffield United striker Geoff Horsfield, however. \"We've got some good forwards here and we haven't made any inquiries about Geoff.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
