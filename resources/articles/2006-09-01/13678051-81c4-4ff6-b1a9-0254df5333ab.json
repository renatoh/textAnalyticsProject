Such as: is Renaissance man Craig Allardyce single? Or: how is it possible for the Hungarian premier to lie convincingly for years about the state of a country's economy? Isn't more than one person supposed to keep an eye on this stuff? Or: was David Beckham under the impression that it might be helpful to reveal that Tom Cruise has been counselling him for his distress at being dropped from the England squad? Because if anything's going to encourage Steve McClaren to conclude that he made a mistake in culling him, it is the fact that the former captain is getting therapy from a sofa-surfing liability who believes humans are engaged in a trillion-year war against the alien energies implanted in them by an intergalactic tyrant, who is currently imprisoned in a volcano. Certainly, Scientology does give you the facts - hey, it's the religion with science in the title - but does it put the England head coach's problems with his midfield into perspective? Above all, though, in terms of inquiries that clamour for an urgent answer: is there nothing that can be done to help football managers and players caught cruelly unawares by the start of the season? If you have missed this vogueish ailment doing the rounds, be assured it is something we should all take desperately seriously. Last week an outbreak was diagnosed in Shunsuke Nakamura, who took to the airwaves to complain that Celtic weren't ready to play Manchester United in their Champions League match at Old Trafford. Shortly before that, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger said it would take 10 weeks for his Arsenal Vincibles to be ready to embark properly on their various campaigns, while barely a week passes without Jose Mourinho explaining with a bitter shrug how unprepared Chelsea are for some tie or other. Of all the moans emanating from the oppressed social minority that is top-flight football in this country - and we must salute those who have found the courage to be vocal on the matter - this is perhaps the easiest with which to sympathise. Indeed, so affecting are the complaints that the situation seems comparable to that famous first airing of Ken Loach's Cathy Come Home. It cannot be very long before the public outcry gathers unstoppable momentum, and people are demanding that Something Must Be Done. Perhaps - and one is forced to think outside the box here, naturally - the powers that be could expend more of their budget publicising the fixture list when it is drawn up, and reminding clubs of the important part it will play in their next season, the better that managers are not so publicly embarrassed when they turn over a page in their diary sometime in early October and discover that they have a Champions League game pencilled in. Of course, the Premier League chief executive, Richard Scudamore, is unlikely to be available to mastermind the effort. Once he has recovered from the shock he no doubt descended into while watching Panorama on Tuesday night, he will have to catch up on much background reading on this so-called culture of \"bungs\" about which he has hitherto been so sceptical. But the establishment of a fixture early-warning system could well be something to which the FA's Brian Barwick could turn his thoughts. It is, of course, too late for such action this season. With no such plan in place, every week sides who feel they really \"aren't ready\" are pressurised by their peer group into taking the plunge. It's very much like losing one's virginity in the mid west. Alas, whereas abstinence programmes have in taken off in that forward-thinking region of the United States, there is no comparable support structure in the Premiership, and so it is that, for the next few weeks, Wenger will be condemned to live the football equivalent of that nightmare when you find yourself shoved on to centre stage in a play and realise you have completely forgotten to learn your lines. It goes without saying this cannot be good for his notoriously fragile nerves. It is all very well warning him now that next season he may have to face Chelsea as early as the second half of August, and to plan his summer accordingly. Indeed, you could prepare him for the worst by hazarding that this might be the case every year for the rest of his time in English football. But as with the others who have been ambushed by the fixture list, this is not much use now, and our thoughts should be most compassionately with them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
