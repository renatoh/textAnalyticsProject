Aberdeen, at home to Motherwell, took the lead through Ben Thornley only for the visitors to reply with goals from Karl Ready and David Kelly. But they refused to buckle and went on to win 4-2. Robbie Winters scored the equaliser just before half-time, and Darren Mackie and substit ute Hicham Zerouali added the others in the second half. Dundee United owed their 3-2 win over Dunfermline (after the latter had fought back from two goals down to 2-2) to a Jim Hamilton penalty nine minutes from time. Hearts, criticised for being too negative in their defeat by Celtic, produced the perfect response with three goals against Dundee - one from Colin Cameron and two from Gary Wales - in the opening 18 minutes. Dundee had to wait until four minutes from the end to get the ball in the net themselves, through Georgi Nemsadze. 'I thought Colin Cameron had an exceptional game. It's the way he gets forward, makes runs and takes responsibility - overall I was extremely pleased with his performance,' the Hearts manager, Craig Levein, said. Dundee coach Ivano Bonetti seemed to take the defeat almost as an insult. 'This is the last time we want to lose against Hearts. We've got better players and more quality than them.' Kilmarnock earned their first Premier League win of the season, 2-1 over St Johnstone. The Saints are rooted to the bottom of the tabke, without a point, and their manager Sandy Clark said: 'The way we played today could be described as suicide defending.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
