The January transfer window has been dominated by stories linking the biggest stars in the Premier League \u2013 from Diego Costa to Dimitri Payet \u2013 with big-money moves to China. Wenger believes it will take years for China to build a football culture that can properly compete with those in Europe but warns of \u201cdanger\u201d should China-sized salaries become the norm. \u201cYou do not create a top league just like that,\u201d Arsenal\u2019s manager said. \u201cWhen you want to be a football player your first aspiration is to play in the best league with the best players. After that, you want to combine playing in the best league with the best players for the maximum amount of money. That combination is best in England right now. But professional football in England was created 150 years ago. And we still struggle, you know. I believe it\u2019s a slow process of creating a football culture. \u201cIn China it\u2019s new. I know that situation well because, when I went to Japan in 1995, professional football had only been in existence for three years. You expect reflexes from people that aren\u2019t there; the culture of professional football is not there. So it will take time. But China has moved forward. It tries to promote football and I\u2019m happy that football has become popular in China. I also expect India to come to the game too you know. I hope it will happen.\u201d Wenger\u2019s relaxed attitude contrasts with that of many commentators who see deals such as the \u00a352m, \u00a3400,000-a-week transfer of Oscar from Chelsea to Shanghai SIPG as distorting the transfer market. Furthermore, even the suggestion of an approach from a Chinese club has been enough to cause friction between players and clubs, as is believed to have been the case with Costa at Chelsea. Wenger believes such offers become problematic only if they constitute a benchmark for the game as a whole. \u201cOverall the players have everything today to be more happy than 20 years ago, never mind 40,\u201d Wenger said. \u201cThey are treated very well, they have a fantastic income. They have freedom of movement which we didn\u2019t have. The danger is that players start asking for money that\u2019s unrealistic in the Premier League. If Chinese wages become the benchmark then you cannot compete with that. But we do not know whether, in 10 years\u2019 time, China will still be doing it. Sometimes, if it\u2019s a political decision, that can change.\u201d Wenger\u2019s instincts appear to have been borne out. Reports suggest that regulations governing the Chinese Super League have been changed, with 18 new rules being put in place by the Chinese government\u2019s official sporting body. One such rule would see \u201cultra-high-worth\u201d signings being heavily taxed. The number of foreign nationals allowed in any CSL XI is being reduced from four to three."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
