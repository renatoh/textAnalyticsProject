West Bromwich fell behind again but showed their character by scoring a late winner; Ipswich's football was a pure delight but their defence collapsed under cross-examination. West Brom's fifth straight win, and their 10th away from home, leaves them level on points with Norwich at the top of the First Division. Ipswich, who had won three on the trot themselves before this, remain ninth but are still only a point away from a play-off position. This was not a typical West Brom performance. They are the most difficult side to play in this division because of their physicality and directness as well as their potency at set-pieces. But they did not impose themselves here until halfway through the second half, when they scored twice in three minutes, first to equalise and then to take the lead. The man who changed the match was Jason Koumas, who came on for Artim Sakiri at half-time. At the break West Brom were lucky to be trailing by only one goal, scored after 43 minutes when Matt Richards crossed from the left and Tommy Miller sprinted between Darren Moore and Thomas Gaardsoe to slide the ball under Russell Hoult. But Koumas and Lloyd Dyer, who replaced Mark Kinsella in the 67th minute, were to have a profound effect on the visitors' fortunes. In the 71st minute West Brom were awarded a free-kick after Matt Elliott was judged to have fouled Geoff Horsfield 25 yards out. Andy Johnson attempted to take it quickly but the whistle went. Then Koumas curled a magnificent strike just inside a post. Two minutes later Dyer put West Brom in front from Horsfield's clever reverse pass and Portman Road fell silent. But Ipswich, inspired throughout by Jim Magilton, regrouped to level in the 78th minute. The West Brom players appeared to be looking for a foul on their goalkeeper Joe Murphy, who had replaced the injured Hoult at half-time. Ipswich's Shefki Kuqi collided with him and Murphy fell to earth, taking Moore with him. Amid the mess Darren Bent slid the ball into the net. But Gary Megson's team are well practised in scoring late winners and that is what they did, with 20 seconds remaining of the four added minutes. Koumas pushed the ball out to Lee Hughes on the right and Horsfield, who was clearly offside as the move developed, converted the cross. Megson said: \"In the second half we looked like a side who would be promoted. In the first we looked as if we were just hoping to go up. The substitutes made a difference but what really happened is that everyone else stepped up their game after the break. \"Jason is probably the best player outside the Premiership and as good as many in it. He is the biggest enigma we've got. He is a fantastic player on the ball and his free-kicks are special. But he's got to do it all the time, not just when he feels like it. And that also means tracking back to help out.\" Ipswich's manager Joe Royle looked devastated. \"We have conceded seven goals and six points to a side who are certainties for automatic promotion but, when you look at it, there is not a midge's dick between the two sides. \"We play football a level above anything else in this division. But too many players seem to think defending is not part of their contract. When the opposition have the ball some players don't seem bothered.\" Ipswich have conceded more goals at home in this division than any other club apart from the effectively doomed Wimbledon. And the Dons do not really play at home these days. Man of the match: Jason Koumas (West Bromwich)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
