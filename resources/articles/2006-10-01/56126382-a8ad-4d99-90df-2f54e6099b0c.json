As the new Davis Cup coach the Swede is part of a brains trust which, it is hoped, can put the Great back in Britain. \"It's about time that something happens in Britain. Obviously they have Wimbledon, they have money and a few players here and there but it could be so much better if you have the right people around,\" said Lundgren, who signed a two-year contract with the LTA on Sunday to work alongside the British captain, John Lloyd. \"There are also great coaches in England but it's good to have a mix. It's always good to change and try something different. You had to do something. We need to bring in some belief and change the standards.\" As well as Lundgren and Brad Gibert, Andy Murray's coach, the LTA chief executive, Roger Draper, is believed to be in talks with Paul Annacone, who coached Pete Sampras before joining forces with Tim Henman; Carl Maes, Kim Clijsters' former coach; and Nigel Sears, who worked with the top 10 women Amanda Coetzer and Daniela Hantuchova. It is not hard to understand why Draper wanted Lundgren. The LTA chief has made clear his desire to assemble the world's most talented coaches in the hope of changing the culture of failure that has pervaded British tennis for so long. With an annual income of about \u00a330m and millions more in the reserves, money is no barrier for the LTA. Lundgren, 41, played Davis Cup for Sweden and coached Marcelo R\u00edos and Marat Safin, but he is best known for bringing out Roger Federer's brilliance during their five-year partnership. He and the then teenage Federer first became acquainted in 1997 when Lundgren was employed by the Swiss Tennis Federation, which was undergoing the sort of seismic changes that the LTA is currently in the throes of. \"The situation is pretty similar,\" said Lundgren. \"Then we had Sven Groenefeld, we had Peter Carter and myself and some Swiss guys - a mix of people from different countries. I think it's pretty good sometimes that you mix things up and learn from each other. The LTA are trying to do something, the same as it was in Switzerland when I started working there. \"In 1997 they completely changed everything and we started from scratch. I wasn't particularly looking for something like this but it was something different. I always liked Davis Cup because it's fun. I worked with three top players one-on-one and it's kind of a challenge to do something different.\" In his new role, Lundgren will assist Lloyd in trying to maximise the talent available in the United Kingdom in the hope of providing some long-term support for Murray. As talented as the 19-year-old Scot undoubtedly is he cannot get Great Britain from their current position in the Davis Cup's second tier back into the 16-nation World Group single-handedly. Lundgren and Lloyd have each committed about 15 weeks a year and will split their time so that either one or the other can be on hand during most weeks of the season to scout potential Davis Cup players and offer advice to other players and coaches. The days when a Davis Cup captain and his coach turned up a few days before each tie are long gone. Great Britain's next assignment - at home against the Netherlands - is not until next April, yet Lundgren and Lloyd are already putting together dossiers on the Dutch players. \"I just think it's important that we go at this at 110%,\" said Lloyd, who shares an agent with Lundgren and has known the Swede for more than 20 years. \"And when you've got someone like Peter it adds another notch. Personally I think we're very fortunate to have him. When I got the job Peter was the first guy that I wanted. If we are going to set the bar high, we've got to have people around to push the guys hard. \"To be honest to the young guys coming up, they've got Brad who is doing us a few little coaching things here and there and now Peter's involved. They are pretty damned lucky. I think if they've got any brains, they will be looking at that and going 'holy crap, we can't have better opportunities than that'.\" That colourful phrase should haunt any British player or coach who does not make the most of the world-class advice now available to them. Lundgren will be the first to tell them that there is no substitute for hard work, whether you have the coaching gal\u00e1cticos at your beck and call or not. Swede's strong points Technical advice Has worked with three world No1s and is acknowledged as one of the world's most accomplished coaches Emotional control If he can calm Marat Safin, blubbing Brits should be no problem Nurturing young talent Working for the Swiss Tennis Federation in 1997 he helped turn Roger Federer, then 16, from a prodigy into a grand slam champion A taste of life at the top The likes of Jamie Baker and Josh Goodall can learn from his experience of world-class tennis Sense of fun Quieter than Lloyd but both believe in team bonding and lots of locker-room laughs"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
