That said, I was successfully bitten many times over. However, it is a beautiful island set right in the middle of the British Virgin Islands. It has beautiful clear blue sea all round. One approaches the island by taking a flight to Antigua, then a small hop flight to Tortola, then you have to take a launch to the island as it's completely isolated. The house on the island is based on an old Balinese longhouse and all the raw materials were brought over, including a full size snooker table. And the style of the house is very open. It has 10 bedrooms, a private swimming pool and open-air lounging and dining areas. I went there twice with Princess Diana, Earl Spencer and several children including Prince William and Prince Harry. We spent the days, sailing, swimming and I went scuba diving with Earl Spencer to a wreck near the island, where we spotted a huge variety of colourful fish. There are four tennis court and five beaches on the island and the rules stated that people could land but not step beyond the waterline so there was never any intrusion. It is very well managed by local folk. The staff can prepare fresh food like lobster lunch with fruit, served in the shade of the pagoda, at the beach pool's floating dining pavilion, or you can eat at a huge dining table which has silver, lace, linen and crystal place settings. It's the perfect holiday if you want to be alone with friends. I walked around the whole island with Prince William in around four hours. Small enough to walk round, but at 74 acres big enough to get lost in. \u00b7 Ken Wharfe: Diana: Closely Guarded Secret, \u00a36.99, O'Mara Books Interview by Gavan Naden"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
