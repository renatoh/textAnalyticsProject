Ben Wolstenholme", "bodyText": "Drawing was always my forte. I did A-level art and a graphic design foundation course. But as my competitive edge emerged, I realised that I didn't just want to draw, I wanted to respond to a brief. That's when I became more interested in film and moving graphic design, centring on advertising and branding. But at this stage most branding was static and print-orientated. Work experience at Landor, one of the longest-established branding agencies, gave me access to big brands, such as 7Up. I gained a second taste of the industry at Magic Hat. And on the back of that, I went on to freelance for both. At Magic Hat I worked on MTV and Pepe Jeans, doing a lot of storyboarding and art direction. I worked with a lot of young, feisty people in what was a fairly maverick part of the McCann-Erickson agency. This ensured there were numerous opportunities for creative input and they were very open to ideas. At Landor I was assigned to do a a series of films for Ford. As making films was not something normally offered as part of the branding process, I was given free rein. And after projects with Ford and Shell I recommended Landor set up an audiovisual division. The company asked me to write a business model and come back with projections even though I was still only a freelance. And I was busy, with NTL pursuing me to do a TV programme about British ice hockey. Someone from Sky Sports had come to see my degree show, as well as that of my friend James Bull. Now with NTL, he asked if we knew how to make TV programmes. We said yes - although we didn't. He needed a team of creatives to make the programme, forcing me to research ice hockey extensively. I was still at Landor when I got the go-ahead. We created the running order and whole identity for the programmes, which followed the exploits of the Guildford Flames. In addition, there was a 22-man crew to manage, who filmed the games with eight cameras. I really enjoyed making the NTL series, but I didn't want to be stuck in sports broadcasting. I enjoyed the look and feel of the programme - the bugs and idents - rather than handling cameras at the edge of a hockey rink. On the basis of that success, James and I formed a company, Moving Brands, based on the business model for audiovisual branding I never submitted to Landor. I was 23, having graduated little over a year earlier. At times the work didn't come in, but thanks to recommendations, we were lucky to be given the branding work for Paul Smith clothes. It helped being awarded contracts for big brands such as PlayStation. These clients liked the fact that we were young, digital and fairly cheap. I suggested Landor moved into new media, and now they came to me with work. I've always had big ideas about using technology in a creative way. In 2000, though, we hit trouble after deciding the previous year to develop portable satellite broadcast equipment. We wrote a patent and I showed it live on Tomorrow's World, carrying out the world's first OB from Outer Mongolia, via a lightweight videophone that fitted in a rucksack. Despite investing \u00a3170,000 in the technology, the market was not there for it at the time. The Foreign Office was one of the few to see the benefits, but there weren't many other takers. Now videophones are an essential piece of kit for international news broadcasters. But pursuing the technology caused problems because we were still busy with branding work and we probably took our eye off the ball. As the dotcom downturn hit and we suffered a cashflow crisis, we realised that we had to focus on what we were good at - branding. It is good having big ideas, but it is costly pursuing them. A key turning point was winning the pitch for Telewest Broadband later in 2000. We designed an identity that moved, as opposed to a traditional static one, and beat teams that included Saatchi and Saatchi. These were exciting times again. Last year I decided to expand our business by grasping interactive technology. Branding has been traditionally very static, in terms of logos, letterheads and business cards, and advertising very trend-based. My passion, though, is making identities come to life. Despite being CEO at 30, I don't feel like I've even started. Moving Brands doesn't have much of a profile, but we're doing something unique.
