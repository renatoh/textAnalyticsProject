The exciting Manchester City midfielder, who has previously made three substitute appearances, is played in the forward line with Wayne Rooney and Michael Owen in a so-trendy-it-hurts 4-3-3 line-up. With six centre-backs out \"injured\", The Wes Brown Comedy Experience makes its first England appearance in two years, partnering Jamie Carragher in central defence. England: Robinson, Gary Neville, Brown, Carragher, Ashley Cole, Beckham, Gerrard, Lampard, Wright-Phillips, Owen, Rooney. Holland: Van der Sar, Kromkamp, Mathijsen, Boulahrouz, Van Bronckhorst, Landzaat, Heitinga, Van der Vaart, Castelen, Makaay, Kuijt. Referee: Peter Frojdfeldt (Sweden) Preamble The teams troop out of the Villa Park tunnel, with England wearing red short-sleeved shirts, white shorts and red socks. Holland are wearing black and white halved shirts, black shorts and white socks in a bid to kick racism out of football. All the players on England's teams are wearing \"let's kick racism out of football\" badges on their shirts; all of them except Gary Neville, that is, whose badge reads: \"Let's kick Reyes out of football\". The teams are introduced to assorted well-fed men in suits, one of whom looks suspiciously like an unshaven Fifa president, Sepp Blatter. Perhaps he's off to the Brit Awards later and is looking to exude a bit of stubbly rock star cool. New FA big cheese Brian Barwick is also present and moves down the line with elan, before some lady sings the national anthems. Looking at the mascots lined up in front of the players, it's worth pointing out that somebody has had the mischievous idea of appointing one to Shaun Wright-Phillips that's the same height as him, if not taller. 1 min: England kick off playing from right to left, but Holland take possession and give Paul Robinson an early touch in the England goal. 2 mins: England force a corner early doors, which is swung in from the right by David Beckham. Steven Gerrard creeps into the Holland box, but his meaty header goes straight at Edwin van der Sar. Not a bad effort considering I was expecting the ball to get lost forever in the bottomless abyss that is the furrow in the Liverpool midfielder's forehead. 3 mins: England go forward, but Boulahrouz dispossesses Lampard with a firm challenge. Castelen sends in a wonderful cross from the right, which Gary Neville sends out for a corner. Van der Vaart swings it into the England box, Beckham's near-post clearance is poor and Holland remain in possession. 7 mins: An email, from Michael Meagher: \"Rob Smyth, doing the cricket commentary, and not having a lot to choose from by way of e-mails, totally ignored this: If you're in Seattle, as I was recently, is it acceptable to go to a Starbucks on the basis that it is a local coffee shop?\" Thanks Michael. Thanks for that. Thank you for thinking that I'd want emails that are not considered interesting enough to grace Rob Smyth's cricket commentaries on a slow day for my football report. Spare me his cast-offs. 9 mins: Reasonably promising attacks from both sides in quick succession. Edwin van der Sar just beat David Beckham to a great long pass from Steven Gerrard. Immediately afterwards, a Wes Brown slip on the edge of the England box almost let the Dutch in. 11 mins: In the England half, Shaun Wright-Phillips loses possession to Castelen, who plays the ball through to Kuijt. He shoots across the box, beats Robinson and rattles the upright. The ball bounces out, England counter and Rooney crosses from the right to Owen, who blasts a very scorable chance over the bar. This isn't bad for a friendly. 13 mins: Due to Wayne Rooney's inability to contain Castelen on the left wing, he's switched positions with Shaun Wright-Phillips, who's moved across from the right. England are looking very uncomfortable playing this 4-3-3 formation everybody - including me - has been waffling faux-knowledgably about, but this doesn't stop David Beckham getting in behind the Dutch defence and pulling the ball back from the end-line. Shaun Wright-Phillips drags an excellent scoring opportunity wide. On its way, the ball takes a deflection. A corner for England, from which nothing comes. 16 mins: \"How come when I get on a plane to Tokyo all the passengers appear Caucasian but by the time we're getting off they all look Japanese?\" enquires Steve Gaw, in an email entitled: My Thoughts. 18 mins: With Frank Lampard backing up Rooney and Owen in the middle, David Beckham fails to deliver a cross from the right. Gary Neville doesn't, however, but with the goal gaping, Shaun Wright-Phillips fails to adjust his feet in time to score into an empty goal from exactly six yards out. Bad news for him, but good news for those of us who've stuck a few quid on the Dutch to win this game in order to make it a bit more interesting. 21 mins: Heittinga brings down David Beckham, wide on the right between penalty area and touchline. The England captain sends the free-kick across to the far post, where Steven Gerrard tries to score with an ambitious scissors kick. If it had gone in it would have been one of the greatest goals of all time. As it didn't, he just looked like a pub-team footballer with notions above his station. 23 mins: After good work from Rooney, Steven Gerrard plays a great cross-field pass from left to right, towards Shaun Wright-Phillips, who has switched wings with Rooney again in what appears to be - and I might be flattering myself somewhat here - an effort to annoy me. There's too much pace on the pass, however, and it beats the wee midfielder to the touchline. 27 mins: Wright-Phillips wins a corner for England after picking up the ball on the right, taking on and beating three Dutch defenders before being dispossessed in the penalty area by a great tackle by Van Bronckhorst. The resulting corner kick is cleared. 30 mins: \"I just read that Matt Holland has come in for Keane in their friendly, yet he keeps popping up against England,\" writes Simon Vaughan in Toronto, who should know better. Just because it's a friendly, don't think you can get away with sending me in any old lame tripe. That's lazy. I demand funnier gags. I demand the funniest gags known to humanity. 33 mins: On the left wing, just outside the Dutch penalty area, Shaun Wright-Phillips turns Kromkamp inside out, makes his way into the box and drags an effort that's as feeble as a Simon Vaughan gag wide when he should have crossed low and hard across the edge of the six-yard box. 35 mins: On the BBC coverage, Motty and Graeme Le Saux are diplomatically trying to figure out what David Beckham's role in the England formation is. Going on his performances over the last three years, it seems his duties are no different tonight than at any other time: taking corners, getting skinned for pace, going missing for long periods, jumping out of tackles and telling Wayne Rooney to stop shouting at the referee every now and again. 39 mins: \"I live in Seattle and us residents actually frown on going to Starbucks, prefering Tulleys instead,\" writes Keith Miller. \"Still that doesn't stop Starbucks having a store on every corner.\" I have to confess that I've never been in Seattle, but if I ever do visit I'd like to go to Cafe Nervosa, where Frasier, Niles, Daphne and Martin Crane used to do their coffee-supping. It always seemed like the kind of pretentious bohemian environment I'd feel at home in. 43 mins: Owen goes down in a heap under a challenge from Mathijsen and Boulahrouz, winning a free-kick for England on the edge of the Holland box. Slightly to the left of the D, Beckham strikes and hits some poor hoor who's standing in the wall in the chops. Half-time 47 mins: While working selflessly to bring you a picture of proceedings at Villa Park at half-time, my computer crashed, so apologies for the delayed return. Sven Goran Eriksson has been his usual adventurous self at half-time, bringing on Owen Hargreaves for Frank Lampard. Stuart Downing and Andy Johnson remain on the bench. Why? More to the point - why does Sven get paid \u00a33m+ pa for this kind of caution and cowardice? It wouldn't take him this long to spring into action if there was an FA secretary kicking her heels nearby. 49 mins: England win a corner, nothing comes from it. 51 mins: I should add that Holland manager Marco van Basten has made no changes for this half, probably because he sent a very inexperienced team out to start. Compared to the first half, this has been dull. There's not much going on so far in this period. For anyone who's interested - Castelen has been proving quite a handful for Ashley Cole in England's left-back position. He's a class act. 54 mins: David Beckham fails to get on the end of an excellent Steven Gerrard cross from the left. All it needed was a lunge and a touch, but he missed it completely. Bad luck? Cowardice? A reluctance to mess up his hair? Ineptitude? Well, I can tell that the replay shows he wasn't even looking at the ball when he went to head it, which would suggest his effort was half-hearted at best and cowardly at worst. You decide. 58 mins: A surging run by Wayne Rooney deep in to Holland territory earns England a free-kick when Boulahrouz clips his ankles. Just outside the Dutch box and slightly to the left, David Beckham sends in a vicious inswinger. It doesn't trouble Edwin van der Sar unduly. \"If Sven used all this subs at half-time, how would he repeatedly break up the flow of the game in the second-half?\" asks Phil McTim. \"It's tactical, see.\" 60 mins: England substitutions: Johnson and Downing replace Rooney and Wright-Phillips. Holland substitution: Van Bommel for Heitinga. Hurrah! 63 mins: For Holland, Castelen gets the better of Ashley Cole on the edge of the penalty area and thumps a wonderful half-volley past Paul Robinson into the England goal. His sterling effort is disallowed as he was correctly adjudged to have tugged Cole's shirt on his way past him. 65 mins: Holland substitution: Yildirim for the excellent Castelen. Motty stat alert: Stuart Downing is the first Middlesbrough-born Middlesbrough player to represent England in 40 years. Where does he get them, eh? 66 mins: Sven appears to have told Andy Johnson to play on the right wing, working as cover for Gary Neville. I don't know why either. Why not just put him in goals instead of Paul Robinson, get the token-cap-as-demanded-by-public-opinion out of the way and be done with it altogether. Stuart Downing, meanwhile, has been instructed to replace Matthew Tait in the first centre position of the England rugby team to face France in the Six Nations on Sunday. 70 mins: David Beckham wins a free-kick wide on the right after being fouled by Boulahrouz. The ball is worked around the edge of the penalty area, but Van Bommel clears for Holland before anyone can muster a shot on goal. 72 mins: Andy Johnson does well to win the ball wide on the right and send in a cross. Sadly, his mystifying presence on the right wing precludes him from being in the centre to head it goalwards and a good chance goes a-begging. What the devil is Sven doing playing him out there? He's been playing up front on his own all season for Crystal Palace, so it makes no sense at all to have him loitering out on the flank here tonight. 75 mins: Excellent play by the Dutch ends with a good Van Bommel effort being deflected over the England crossbar by Ashley Cole. Van der Vaart sends it in from the left, but his cross is too high for Mathijsen. England clear. 77 mins: Gerrard passes to Andy Johnson, who's still in exile out on the right wing. He wins a throw-in, which Gary Neville hurls into the penalty area. Holland clear. 79 mins: England substitutions: Jenas and Dyer for Gerrard and Beckham. Owen takes the skipper's armband from Beckham. Following their instructions from the England manager, Jenas goes and mans a hot-dog stand behind the Holte End, while Dyer replaces the stadium announcer. 82 mins: England launch a sortie of sorts down the left wing, which sees the ball bounce out of play for a goal-kick, while Ashley Cole and Boulahrouz chase it fruitlessly. Holland counter and Jamie Carragher is called upon to intervene after good hold-up play by Roy Makaay enabled Holland to get a cross into the penalty area. Trust me when I tell you that it's even duller fare than it sounds, and has been since the interval. 85 mins: Owen's gets a flick on a cross from the right, but it's easy for Edwin van der Sar. Meanwhile, Alasdair Clark in Auckland has this to say: \"Sven's crap. Worse than Berti Vogts I suspect. It's just that he has some half decent player to use.\" Keep your eyes peeled in Auckland for an Irish pal of mine who moved out there to revolutionise the telecommunications industry a couple of weeks ago, Alasdair. His name is Alan Curley, but he answers to Bullets. He'll be in the pub. 87 mins: A goal late doors for Holland would cheer your commentator up no end, as I've a score on them to win this fiasco at 3/1. I can't see it coming though. Here's a revolutionary idea: From now on, international friendlies should be reduced to 45 minutes in length, with two substitutions per team, no half-time interval and - accordingly - no second half. This is unspeakable rubbish. 89 mins: Gary Neville carelessly loses the ball in the final third, enabling Holland to counter-attack. It's four on three, but Kuijt dilly-dallies, allowing England to get some defenders back. The Dutch striker has a pop from distance, but Robinson saves easily. \"Why do England keep this clown of a manager around?\" asks Greg Kutylo. \"His team is boring and they don't win anything. All that talent going to waste because of his indecision.\" Full-time: The referee puts everyone out of their misery, allowing us all to get on with what's left of our lives. Sven will have learned nothing from this match, although his Dutch couterpart Marco Van Basten may well have. He blooded six or seven new players and gave them 90 minutes each. Sven's decisions, on the other hand, were mystifying: Andy Johnson playing wide on the right on his international debut, Shaun Wright-Phillips switching from wing to wing, David Beckham playing ..."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
