Only 26 of the 11,500 Chinese people living in Milan are recorded to have died between 2000 and 2004. Giulio Gallera, the Milan councillor responsible for the city's cemeteries, told the newspaper Il Giornale that the figures were \"certainly singular\". The paper said it was suspected that other deaths had been hushed up so that the deceased's papers could be used by people who were in Italy illegally. But, if so, where did the bodies go?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
