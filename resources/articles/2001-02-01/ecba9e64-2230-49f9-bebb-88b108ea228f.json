The joke was lost on most as a convoy of 60 coaches heaving with happy Hammers blew bubbles all the way back to the East End. West Ham may be without a league win this year but their dreams of a first final in 21 years are looking less fanciful. Having seen off Manchester United, Harry Redknapp's side breached another fortress on Saturday to condemn Sunderland to their first Cup defeat at the Stadium of Light. Paolo di Canio's goal 14 minutes from time had been enough at Old Trafford, so Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9 repeated the dose on Wearside, erasing the memory of a succession of earlier missed chances. Most of the 5,500 travelling fans had left London at 4.30am, yet it was the Frenchman who had appeared half asleep, miscontrolling Christian Dailly's through-ball and scuffing Michael Carrick's pass wide. Kanout\u00e9 was also hauled back by the assistant's flag 11 times; no Premiership player has been offside so often in a game this season. But, with Joe Cole, Frank Lampard and Carrick effervescent in midfield, Sunderland's back-line continued to play dangerously high up the pitch. Lampard fluffed another duel with Thomas Sorensen before setting up the only goal. \"They're all frightening talents,\" said Redknapp. \"You've always got a chance with such special players in your team; if one isn't having a good game, someone else will deliver the goods.\" While the visitors were all subtle promptings, their youthful midfield skipping among the clutter to caress the ball into space, Sunderland huffed and puffed, flinging balls towards Niall Quinn. The Irishman might have had a penalty when he buckled under Igor Stimac's tug. \"The lad had his arms locked around Niall - his fingers were linked together,\" bemoaned Darren Williams. \"If that's not a penalty, then I don't know what is.\" But Quinn was unlikely to prevail against three such wily centre-backs. Dailly looked revitalised, Stimac was assured despite having played only one reserve game after a long-term calf injury. And there was Stuart Pearce. \"He's worth his weight in gold,\" said Redknapp of the 38-year-old. \"The kids look at him and learn from his attitude. I just say to them: 'Watch him work, train, head, close people down.' You don't need coaches when you've got people like him. He doesn't stand three yards off people and watch them collect the ball; he gets up their arse and tackles them. But he wants to win everything and he'd happily kick someone up in the air in training as well.\" For all his glittering career, Pearce has never won the FA Cup. \"I think 1-0 flattered them given the amount of chances we had,\" he said. \"It was a superb performance; there are some fantastic young players in the side playing alongside the older pros - the three lads in midfield have old heads on young shoulders - but it all blends quite well.\" The crowd winced whenever Pearce and Quinn crunched into challenges on the back post. \"The longer the game went on the better he seemed to get,\" said the Irishman. \"He's an absolute example for any kid who wants to know how a professional footballer should conduct himself. I played my first game against him in 1985 and he's still brilliant.\" It was Pearce who snuffed out the home side's best opportunity. Quinn, tight to the goalline, cushioned Chris Makin's looping cross on his instep, flicking it back beyond S\u00e9bastien Schemmel and turning smoothly to lob into the six-yard box. Kevin Phillips jumped, only for Pearce to materialise from nowhere and power the ball over the bar. George McCartney gave the ball away from the resultant corner and Carrick fed Lampard. The midfielder danced around three opponents and slipped his pass through a disorganised rearguard for Kanout\u00e9 to outpace Makin and, as Sorensen tore out of his area, slide the ball into the net. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
