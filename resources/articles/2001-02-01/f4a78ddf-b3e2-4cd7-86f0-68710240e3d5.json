But what is it that he is supposed to do, and who is he? Derek Brown explains. What does the lord chancellor do? Lots of things. As a politician, he is a senior member of the Labour cabinet. As a lawyer, he is top dog: the head of the legal profession, with the power to appoint judges and Queen's Counsel. As a parliamentarian, he acts as speaker of the House of Lords, and gets to sit on the Woolsack. Who is lord chancellor? Alexander Andrew Mackay Irvine. Lord Irvine of Lairg to you and me. 'Derry' to his pals. Why is he in the news? Because, as a Labour man, he wrote to lawyers who are known Labour supporters, inviting them to a dinner - and suggesting that they donate at least \u00a3200 to the party. Thus proving that there is no such thing as a free meal. Why is that a problem? The Tories are making great play of the lord chancellor being supposed - in his legal role - to be impartial and non-political. They say that lawyers receiving the dinner invitation could have felt under pressure to donate funds, because of Lord Irvine's ability, through his power of patronage, to advance their careers. Isn't that a silly way to promote lawyers? The Law Society thinks so. It has called for an independent appointments body to select judges and QCs. It would include lay people as well as lawyers. Others go further: a report from the Economic and Social Research Council last year called for the office of lord chancellor to be abolished, and replaced with a minister of justice accountable to the Commons. Didn't Labour once advocate the same thing? Yes, but that was in the dim and distant past - before 1997. And Lord Irvine's view? Is that the lord chancellor is a bulwark of the constitution; an essential link between executive, parliament, and judiciary. How much does the job pay? The salary is the best in government; more even than the prime minister gets. To be precise, \u00a3173,875. Top barristers would sniff, but lesser mortals wouldn't sneeze at it.
