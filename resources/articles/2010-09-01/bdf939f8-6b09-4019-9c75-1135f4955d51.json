The tradition that has built up over 150 years of ever-more attentive and silent concentration on sound is very precious and special. Our symphony halls are not suitable for much else, certainly not walking around. We should supplement this tradition with another tier, in which musicians are prepared to go into a tent at Glastonbury, a converted factory or public space. These uninhibited half-way houses will be friendly but noisy. The high-quality amplification that becomes important in such spaces is now technically possible; musicians should choose their technicians carefully to be of equal refinement and musicality to themselves. Amplification can be magically soft, suggesting complex space. If this second tier of live music-making is taken really seriously, we can predict that a great many more people will be enabled to participate without prejudice. Our concert halls will fill up again. Jonathan Harvey Lewes In Vanessa Thorpe's article on the proposed amplification of classical music, it is stated that young people are only going to be drawn to classical music if it is amplified and we are free to move around, speak and do as we please during performances. As someone who this year attended the Reading festival, the BBC Proms and Glyndebourne, I can tell you that this is false. Of course there will be teenagers and young adults who are attracted to the easygoing, loud and quite frankly vulgar atmosphere of popular music festivals. However, the vast majority of teenagers will queue for seven hours to listen to the Berliner Philharmoniker perform in the Royal Albert Hall. You have also seem to forgotten that the Proms are concerts where you are allowed to move around as you please. In the gallery or the arena of the Albert Hall, you can sit or even lie down, listening to wonderful music while enjoying a good book or even knitting a cardigan. It is now down to us \u2013 young people with an ingrained passion for classical music \u2013 to invite our friends to concerts, as it seems this is the only way we will get our peers to embrace this alien world. I hope you understand that there are youths in their thousands who are prepared to listen to unamplified music, to sit there in silence and enjoy the music. Hugo Herman-Wilson Croydon Jonathan Harvey's suggestion that concertgoers might well be advantaged by amplification has received a mixed reception and I would, in general, disagree with him. On the other hand, since so much contemporary music is quite awful, such a sound system could be adjusted to render the music inaudible. Martin Sheldon Oxford The aural experience of amplified music is quite different from that of unamplified. In the latter case, the vibrations from the violin strings or the reed of a wind instrument enter directly into the ear, where they are reciprocated anatomically. With amplified music, what is heard is an electronic replication of the orchestral sound, as with a recording. Electronic replication can be a wonderful asset, but it means that, if a concert is amplified through electronic speakers, the listener may as well be at home hearing it on DVD. Here in Oxford, we used to hear choral voices from Magdalen Great Tower live each May morning. The choir is still there but now we hear it from speakers electronically at ground level \u2013 and we may as well put on the disc at home. Dr Ian Flintoff Oxford With engaging titles such as Dum transisset sabbatum and Passion and Resurrection, I see no reason for British youth to be alienated from Jonathan Harvey's music, amplified or not.
