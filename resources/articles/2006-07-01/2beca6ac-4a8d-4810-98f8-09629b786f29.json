Ambulance and fire officers said the pilot managed to steer the single-engine plane away from an 11-storey block of flats moments before it crashed on a cricket square. The pilot, named as Sam Cross, who was on his second solo flight after clocking up 15 hours of flying, also narrowly missed a playground, houses, a factory and a main road before crashing at Leigh-on-Sea, Essex. He was killed instantly. East of England Ambulance Service spokesman Murray Macgregor said: \"It may be some small comfort to the lad's family that he appears to have deliberately steered away from a kids' playing area, a bowling green and a nearby tower block. \"He managed to put the plane down so that no one else was hurt. It could well have been that he saved their lives. He was obviously thinking of others at the time and that shows real courage.\" The government's air accidents investigation branch is investigating the crash, which happened shortly after 4pm on Wednesday. Sam Cross was a member of the Sea-wing Flying Club, based at Southend airport. In a statement, the club described him as an \"accomplished student\". It is thought he was heading back to Southend airport in the Cessna 150 plane, where his father was waiting for him. He seemed to get into trouble as he neared the block of flats, Beaver Tower in Leigh-on-Sea, before crashing into Eastwood Park, a few minutes' flight time from the airport. Brian Nichols, 52, who spotted the plane as he drove near the park, said: \"It was flying low and slow and was banking from one side to another. When it got near the park it seemed to turn left sharply. It looked like it stalled, then it nose-dived and came straight down spinning. I half hoped the plane would power up and emerge with a flourish from the other side of the trees, but it didn't.\" Police, firefighters and paramedics arrived on the scene in minutes followed by members of the boy's family. Louise Sutherland, 28, who was in the park with her two daughters, said: \"I saw a man, he must have been about 21 years old. He didn't have any shoes or a top on. He was screaming when he saw the plane and tried to run over to it. It took about seven people to hold him down. I can still hear his screams, they were awful.\" Diana Perkins, deputy head teacher at Emerson Park School in Hornchurch, which Sam left last summer, said: \"He was a lovely lad, very popular with staff and other youngsters. He was very good at sports; he played football, cricket and he was in the rugby squad. We knew the family well; he had two older brothers that came to the school. He was a very loving outgoing lad, cheerful and supportive.\" A Civil Aviation Authority spokesman said 16 was the the minimum age at which a plane could be flown solo, although people could take flying lessons at any age. \"Before going solo you need to have a significant number of hours of dual flying with an instructor and it is the instructor's decision whether or not the trainee pilot is ready to undertake a solo flight.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
