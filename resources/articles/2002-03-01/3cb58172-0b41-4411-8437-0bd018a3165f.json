Those likely to be left out include the goalkeeper Francisco Molina and the forwards Diego Tristan and Juan Carlos Valeron, who tormented Arsenal at Highbury last week. The influential Fran could also be rested and, with Victor and Lionel Scaloni suspended, Deportivo might begin with less than half the team that won 2-0 in London. They are guaranteed a quarter-final place but need a point to win the group. Juventus's decision to play a weakened team here ahead of more important Serie A matches might appear to give Arsenal a better chance of winning. Yet Ars\u00e8ne Wenger was disappointed. \"I would prefer to play against the normal Juventus team who are already out than the reserve team where everyone will want to prove they are good players - which they are,\" said the manager. It is almost impossible to envisage Uefa taking action against Deportivo or Juventus. There are \"provisions in the regulations\" which allow Uefa to investigate if clubs do not conduct themselves according to the \"principles of loyalty, integrity and sportsmanship\". However, proving a player did not have a valid sicknote is difficult and clubs nominate a 25-man squad from which to choose. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
