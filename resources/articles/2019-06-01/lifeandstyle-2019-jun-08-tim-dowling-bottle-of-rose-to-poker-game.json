No wonder I lost \u2013 badly", "bodyText": "It is a warm and sunny afternoon, and I am in the garden staring at a plant that has been levelled in the night. It\u2019s the kind of damage I would normally blame on the tortoise, but the plant in question is in a raised bed, well out of his reach. My wife comes back from the shops, and finds me staring. \u201cOh dear,\u201d she says. \u201cIt can\u2019t be a slug,\u201d I say. \u201cUnless it\u2019s a slug the size of a ski boot.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s probably the squirrel,\u201d she says. \u201cWould a squirrel eat radicchio?\u201d I say, wincing, as I always do, whenever I have to say \u201cradicchio\u201d out loud. \u201cDunno,\u201d she says. \u201cI bought two nice-ish bottles of ros\u00e9, so you can take one to poker.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t bring ros\u00e9 to a poker game,\u201d I say. \u201cWhy not?\u201d she says. \u201cBecause it\u2019s poker,\u201d I say. \u201cIt would put me at a huge psychological disadvantage.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be silly,\u201d she says. I stare at the razed plant and I think: radicchio and ros\u00e9 \u2013 how did I get here? An hour later I walk down to the new beer shop on the corner. When it first opened I wondered if I would ever become the sort of person who makes a special trip to buy beer; now I\u2019m such a regular customer that the owner waves to me whenever I walk past. He talks me through some of the hundreds of beers available: strong beer, weak beer, white beer, cloudy beer, local beer. I purchase what I think will be a psychologically advantageous selection. \u201cDo you need a bag?\u201d he says. \u201cNo, I have one,\u201d I say, unfolding the M&amp;S shopper I\u2019ve got tucked under my arm. I think: what is happening to me? When I get home, I add a cold bottle of ros\u00e9 to the bag. On Sunday morning I wake with a lingering sense of shame. Radio 4 is playing, and my wife is sitting up in bed looking at her phone. \u201cWhy are we listening to church?\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m waiting for the news,\u201d my wife says. \u201cHow was it?\u201d \u201cI lost,\u201d I say. \u201cBadly.\u201d \u201cOh dear,\u201d she says. \u201cHow much?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you,\u201d I say. \u201cDo we need to sell the car?\u201d she says. \u201cTechnically the car is no longer ours to sell,\u201d I say. \u201cMaybe I don\u2019t want to know,\u201d she says. \u201cThe financial loss, though considerable, was nothing compared to the personal humiliation I suffered in defeat,\u201d I say. \u201cJust give me a rough idea,\u201d she says. \u201cI was so soundly crushed I had to leave early,\u201d I say. \u201cBecause my sad presence was bringing everybody down.\u201d \u201cChrist,\u201d she says. \u201cHow much?\u201d \u201cBut you know what?\u201d I say. \u201cI was not the only person to bring ros\u00e9.\u201d \u201cI told you,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the food was amazing,\u201d I say. \u201cAlex made this salad with pomegranate seeds in it.\u201d \u201cFor poker?\u201d she says. \u201cI know, right?\u201d I say. \u201cIn hindsight, it was the kind of meal I would have happily paid \u00a370 for at a restaurant.\u201d \u201cDid you lose 70 quid?\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not ready to talk about it,\u201d I say. \u201cThe memory is still too raw.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d she says. \u201cI cried a little in the Uber on the way home,\u201d I say. \u201cI think the driver had seen worse.\u201d I have a long bath and two coffees, and my mood lifts. I think about how much more hungover I\u2019d be if I\u2019d won. I find two more razed plants in the garden, but decide life is too short to worry about a squirrel that likes radicchio more than I do. My wife and I leave the house at midday to meet friends for lunch. As we reach the corner, my phone pings. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d my wife says. \u201cIt\u2019s an email to the poker group, saying that somebody left an M&amp;S shopper behind.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s my favourite bag!\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll pick it up later,\u201d I say. We turn left. The owner of the beer shop is standing outside his premises. When he sees me he breaks into a broad smile and waves, and I smile and wave back."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
