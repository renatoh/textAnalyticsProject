Billy Bonds was a permanent fixture in a claret and blue shirt for 21 years, never won an England cap and was forced to withdraw with a rare injury on one occasion when he did receive a call-up. \u201cHe only played about 850 games for West Ham, so I\u2019m not surprised he was injured,\u201d Noble said, when the Bonds comparison was put to him while he was promoting his testimonial, which takes place at Upton Park on Monday. Slaven Bilic, cannot understand why Hodgson has decided not to give Noble a chance in England\u2019s upcoming friendlies against Germany and Holland but West Ham\u2019s captain was in too much of a good mood to indulge in any score settling. Long accustomed to the disappointment of not getting the call when England squads are announced, the midfielder is 29 in May and he knows his latest omission means he should probably forget about going to Euro 2016, even though he has been in the form of his life this season. \u201cI\u2019d love to but I think especially with the squad announcement, if I\u2019m honest with myself, the chances are very slim,\u201d Noble said. \u201cOnce the squad got announced, I just put it to the back of my mind. \u201cThere are some great players in that England squad and a lot of people, and West Ham fans thought I should have been in it but I\u2019m not that sort of person. Obviously, over the last two months there has been so much talk about it and everyone I talk to asks me about it but I just took it in my stride \u2013 if it happened it happened and it would have been a nice problem to have. But it didn\u2019t work that way and I can thoroughly look forward to Monday now. \u201cI\u2019m English, I\u2019ve always wanted to play for England but it\u2019s out of my hands. I\u2019ve loved playing this season, it\u2019s been a great season for me personally and for the club. But there is nothing I can do about England, I\u2019ll just put it to the back of my mind and enjoy Monday with my family and my friends, and have a real good laugh.\u201d Noble, who will donate the proceeds from his testimonial \u2013 current West Ham squad members not involved in internationals versus a West Ham All-Stars XI \u2013 to three charities, Help for Heroes, the Dylan Tombides Foundation and Richard House Children\u2019s Hospice, has not spoken to Hodgson. \u201cIt\u2019s not a personality thing because I\u2019ve started every season under every manager at West Ham since I\u2019ve been here,\u201d Noble said. \u201cI\u2019ve played under Alan Pardew, Gianfranco Zola, Avram Grant, Sam Allardyce, Alan Curbishley and Slaven\u2019s made me captain. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a bad egg. At the end of the day it\u2019s the manager\u2019s decision. Everyone\u2019s got their opinions. So be it. I\u2019ve put it behind me now and I\u2019m just going to enjoy the next couple of months.\u201d His figures were a little off. Bonds played a record 793 times for West Ham and Noble, who made his 376th appearance for his boyhood club in last weekend\u2019s 2-2 draw with Chelsea, has some catching up to do. With West Ham chasing a place in the Champions League and their first FA Cup triumph since 1980, England are the least of his concerns."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
