Yesterday the Frenchman made it clear he will never abandon his attacking philosophy because he feels a duty to entertain the public. Given that Wenger's 443 games with Arsenal have produced 1,222 goals - 804 scored by his team - he can hardly be accused of shortchanging people. Sunday's 5-3 defeat of Middlesbrough was a case in point. With debate raging about Chelsea's approach, Wenger said he respected \"every way of playing\" but there was no question about his preferred style. \"We are in professional football and people pay money to come and see something,\" he said. \"We are not always capable of satisfying them but I think our supporters acknowledge that we try to give them something they pay for.\" Wenger is also mindful of the television audience. He spends so much time at home watching games - last weekend he saw two live matches, two highlights packages and a video of the Middlesbrough game - that he is attuned to what makes people reach for the off button. \"Today people see football [from] all over the world,\" said Wenger. \"If you offer them a boring game they will switch off and go somewhere else. It's not like 20 years ago. Now you can choose what kind of game you watch. Before, you waited to watch a game on TV and when there was one on you watched it completely.\" Wenger, who said his interest in Ajax's Hatem Trabelsi was \"not completely dead\", insisted Arsenal's attacking play can improve because \"perfection doesn't exist in the game\". Tonight, at home to Blackburn, his team can set an English record of 43 successive league games unbeaten. Blackburn's manager Graeme Souness was in the Liverpool team who ended Nottingham Forest's run at 42 matches in 1978. \"Forest were dour, hard to beat and dug out results whereas anybody who knows anything about football enjoys watching this Arsenal,\" Souness said. \"They're spectacular, exciting and everything I would want in a team. \"I suppose there's an argument that until they win the European Cup they won't be regarded with the very best. But I would certainly put them up there with any other club side in my time in football.\" \u00b7 Southampton have signed the Tunisia defender Alledine Yahia from the French club Guingamp for \u00a3350,000."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
