Sought: the ready blessing of His immediate ancestor To rise from the couch of the night. In the second year of his reign The Emperor Felix visited The four corners of his empire. Measured: the heights and surfaces, The location of useful resources, The paces of pilgrimage. In the third year of his reign Figs were placed before him, And bread, and milk and honey. Favours: whimsical largesse To the tasters of his food And the two great cats acknowledged. In the fourth year of his reign His activity was marked, The significant works begun. Ordered: the transport of gravel, Circulation of the terraces, Enumeration of flora. Historians are uncertain About the middle years Of this illustrious reign. Legend proposes the descent Of an all-encompassing slumber, A cessation of enquiry. How then to account for The beating of the stone drum And the heroic investigation Of that murmering surface Which second by second betrays Its resistance to the horizontal? How may we accommodate The richly varied achievements, The cautious calculations, The staggering collection Of objects whose precise use Is to this day uncertain? During his reign his shadow Fell in every direction. He was tireless, and worshipped. He was carried everywhere At his pleasure, his demands Promptly acceded to. Long ago we abandoned Our gods, in disbelief. But him we still believe in."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
