But what would Leonardo DiCaprio make of these?", "bodyText": "Inception might be one of the most highly anticipated movies of the year, but do you know what Christopher Nolan's film is actually about? No. Nobody does. All anyone has to go on is some waffle about \"the architecture of the mind\", a trailer where Leonardo DiCaprio gets flung about to the sound of a water buffalo being trapped in a metal dustbin, and a vague hunch that it has something to do with dream thieves, like a sort of cross between Nightmare On Elm Street and Spooks. Let's hope that our hunch is correct, because movie dreams are so much better than real-life dreams. Look at Inception, for example: the trailer alone hints at crumbling cliffs, zero-gravity punch-ups and entire cities that spectacularly fold in on themselves. Meanwhile, what's the most exciting dream that you've had recently? The one where you wandered around a shoe shop hurling handfuls of your own teeth at your old headmaster? Hardly compares, does it? But all dreams are symbolic, even pretentious movie dreams that only appear to exist to demonstrate how much of a relentlessly self-indulgent show-off the director is. And, thanks to the internet, it's never been easier to dissect dreams and uncover their true meanings. So, by using the first hokey-looking dream interpretation website we found on Google, we've decided to yank apart some of the weirdest dream sequences ever filmed in order to try and make sense of them. Ready? Blade Runner What happens? In the dystopian industrial Los Angeles of the future, Harrison Ford's Deckard nods off at a piano and dreams of a sumptuous sepia-toned unicorn galloping through a forest. Could he really be one of the replicants that he's being paid to kill? What does it mean? People who dream of forests traditionally feel trapped by the pressures of their lives and yearn to escape to something simpler. Meanwhile, the unicorn represents insight and hope. Put together, it seems clear that Deckard should probably stop chasing Rutger Hauer across rooftops so much and think about downsizing to a lovely cottage in Hampshire or something. American Beauty What happens? While watching his daughter's friend Mena Suvari perform a high-school cheerleading routine, middle-aged pervert Kevin Spacey drifts off and imagines that she's performing a sultry striptease for him, climaxing with thousands of rose petals pouring out of her chest. What does it mean? The stripping aspect of Spacey's dream clearly demonstrates his repression and desire to become more sexually open. The petals refer to feelings of guilt and regret. The colour red indicates passion and danger. Put together, this almost certainly means that Kevin Spacey will be killed. Or that his neighbour's son will watch a tedious video of a plastic bag blowing around for hours in the mistaken belief that it will make him look deep. One or the other. Twilight: New Moon What happens? Kristen Stewart is flouncing through a meadow, breathing noisily through her nose, when she happens upon her grandmother and vampire boyfriend, Edward. Suddenly Stewart becomes her grandmother and then she stares into the middle distance for what seems like four hours. What does it mean? On the surface, it may seem as though Stewart is accepting that she'll grow old and die while her vampire boyfriend stays the same age. However, the meadow actually represents security while the grandmother represents protection and unconditional love, so it could be argued that Edward is actually The One. The nose breathing and middle-distance staring, on the other hand, indicate that Kristen Stewart should probably try to learn some new acting techniques. The Big Lebowski What happens? Too much to mention in detail but, variously, Saddam Hussein works in a bowling alley, Jeff Bridges wiggles his bottom at a Viking who looks like Julianne Moore, there's a big staircase like the one from that Take That video, and Bridges floats around looking at some knickers. Oh, and there are some red sort-of tadpole things running around with giant scissors. Phew. What does it mean? If you dream of bowling, you're basically a pervert. Pins mean penises, balls mean testicles and the pin deck is a great big vagina, that you knock your penises into with your testicles, or something. However, the part with the knickers symbolises a feeling of inadequacy stemming from your formative years. Just kidding. It means you're a pervert. Akira What happens? A hospitalised boy is visited by three giant toys. As he tries to escape, he realises that his hospital room is made of Lego. Then a giant car pukes milk all over him. The toys get freaked out by the sight of blood, turn into children and leave. What does it mean? Hospitals in dreams indicate that you're afraid of losing control of your body. Blood suggests that you're feeling emotionally drained. Toys are a representation of domestic happiness. Unfortunately no analysis was available for \"giant milk-puking cars\". On the basis of what we've already seen, chances are it means you're a pervert. Neighbours What happens? Bouncer (a dog) dreams that he's getting married to Rosie (another dog) against an idyllic backdrop of hills and flowers and bunting. At one point Bouncer puts his paw on Rosie's head. That's about it. What does it mean? The wedding suggests Bouncer's subconscious desire to marry the masculine \"animus\" side of his psyche with his less-apparent feminine \"anima\" side in order to unify his personality. This, combined with the blue sky (hope), and the head-touch (control), would seem to indicate that Bouncer is about to embark on a long period of spiritual discovery. Or it means that Bouncer is a pervert. Or that none of it matters because he's just a fictional dog. We don't know. We're not exactly professors at this."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
