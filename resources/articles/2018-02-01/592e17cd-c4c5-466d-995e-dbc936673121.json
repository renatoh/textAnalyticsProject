He has been practising over the winter but the all-rounder\u2019s last competitive match was on 22 December in New Zealand\u2019s domestic T20 competition for Canterbury against Central Districts. Stokes will be tried for affray after indicating he will plead not guilty to the charge after an incident outside a Bristol nightclub in September. In a statement released on Tuesday the ECB backed Stokes\u2019 decision to defend himself in court and confirmed he will not be required to return to the UK for the first hearing at Bristol Crown Court on 12 March. The date falls after the fifth and final ODI on 10 March, during preparations for the first Test which begins on 22 March. The rest of the ODI squad not taking part in the trans-Tasman tri-series will arrive on 18 February but Stokes will join the T20 squad in Hamilton on Friday. Given the scale of travel involved \u2013 Stokes will leave England on Wednesday \u2013 the usual protocol is to give players a day or two off to avoid injury. Accordingly Bayliss, the England coach, says Stokes will not play in the T20 on Sunday against New Zealand and is doubtful for the first ODI against them on 25 February. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t played for a while,\u201d said Bayliss. \u201cIt is not as if we can maybe bring him straight back for these T20s, for example. We have got to get him up to speed and hopefully during this one-day series we can get him back into the team. \u201cAt this stage I\u2019d have to say it was unlikely [he\u2019ll play the first ODI]. We\u2019ll have to wait and see how he is with travel, with practice. The reason we are getting him out as soon as we can is that we can get him up to speed so he is available for selection as early as possible.\u201d \u201cKnowing Stokesy, he trains harder than anyone else. It\u2019ll just be something we have to keep an eye on as the practice days go. That\u2019s the idea \u2013 to try and get him out here before some of the other one-day boys so that he can have an extra few days.\u201d While Stokes\u2019 absence was not necessarily felt during the 4-1 ODI series win against Australia, that success has been sandwiched by a 4-0 defeat in the Ashes and three consecutive Twenty20 failures, with two losses to Australia and on Tuesday against New Zealand. His absence has been felt across the board \u2013 in red- and white-ball, and all three facets of the game. His mere presence, says Bayliss, will be a boost to those around him and the dynamic of the teams.\u201d \u201cTo me, apart from the way he plays, he\u2019s a quality batter and bowler and our best fielder and one of the leaders in our squad. I think one of the biggest things we\u2019ve missed over the summer has been the combinations we\u2019ve been able to play. \u201cRight throughout the summer we\u2019ve been down to five bowlers, especially in the one-dayers and T20s. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to have six bowlers before, which gives the captain plenty of different options. I think that\u2019s what we\u2019ve missed the most apart from his individual performances.\u201d New Zealand offers a less febrile setting for a return than Australia but the chance to get back on the field, Bayliss feels, will be relief enough for Stokes. \u201cThere\u2019s been players in the past who\u2019ve had off-field issues and are able to put that aside and concentrate on cricket. Ben is one of those types of guys but only time will tell. I\u2019ve got a feeling he will be one of the guys.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
