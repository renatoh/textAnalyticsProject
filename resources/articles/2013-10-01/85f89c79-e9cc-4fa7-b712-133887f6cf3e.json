Fresh from being awarded the 2013 Nobel prize for physics, Edinburgh scientist Peter Higgs will make a rare public appearance next month at the launch of a major exhibition exploring the greatest experiment in history, the Cern Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The 84-year-old physicist \u2013 who hid from the media on the day of his award and missed the call from Stockholm \u2013 has agreed to take part in a discussion with young scientists to share the story of the particle that came to define his life: the Higgs boson. The event will mark the opening of Collider, a six-month immersive exhibition that is arguably the Science Museum's most ambitious show to date. The exhibition will blend fact and fiction, drawing on theatrical talents to recreate the experience of life and science at the particle physics laboratory near Geneva. The discussion with Higgs on 12 November will open a day of remarkable events. An afternoon double bill will see Cambridge cosmologist Stephen Hawking speaking on fundamental physics and understanding the universe, plus a conversation between the novelist Ian McEwan and one of the world's leading theoretical physicists, Nima Arkani-Hamed, on the differences and connections between science and art. Art turns out to play a crucial part in an exhibition that hopes to explain a machine that is far larger than the museum itself, whose job is to look for subatomic particles that are too small to see. This called for a more creative approach than usual. \"This was never going to be a 'stuff in showcases with museum labels on' kind of show,\" says its curator, Alison Boyle. The exhibition aims to break fresh ground in the way it allows visitors to explore science and engineering. Ian Blatchford, director of the Science Museum, said the museum had to think outside the familiar models, which he classifies as \"trade show\", \"textbook\" and \"trashy\". Trade show exhibitions are no more than displays of interesting artefacts. Textbook shows are text-heavy and earnest \u2013 all facts and no story. Trashy shows are essentially gimmicks: all whizz-bang, but lacking in substance. \"What we are learning from devising Collider is that the personal stories of the engineers and scientists are absolutely crucial,\" Blatchford says. \"They are the basic ingredient.\" The museum worked with Michael Wynne, the playwright who won an Olivier award for The Priory, on a 10-minute drama setting the scene for the hunt for the Higgs boson. The film is screened in a replica of the Cern laboratory's own auditorium. From here, visitors move into a recreation of the lift that transports them into a replica of the 27km-circumference tunnel, complete with graffiti, that houses the machine. Inside the tunnel the exhibition continues with a look at hydrogen \u2013 the source of protons that are whipped up to speed and fired into the Large Hadron Collider \u2013 and the technology behind the huge electric and magnetic fields used to accelerate and steer beams of protons moving at close to the speed of light. If the beams were to veer off course, they could punch a hole in the machine. The exhibition uses stage sets and video projections to recreate the experience of walking through Cern's underground laboratory. For this, the museum called in video designer Finn Ross, another Olivier award-winner, who worked on acclaimed stage productions of The Master and Margarita and The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time. At Cern, the science takes place where particles collide, and it is here that Ross comes into his own. A 270-degree projection creates the experience of stepping inside the LHC's huge CMS detector cavern. The projection zooms in as proton meets proton in a head-on collision, and pulls back out to show data from the smash streaming to scientists all over the world. \"What's very different about this show is that it doesn't look like a museum exhibition,\" says Boyle. \"It looks like Cern.\" The story is told through the experiences of a handful of scientists and engineers. The sets recreate the hi-tech underground labs where Cern's money is spent, but also the drab 1970s corridors above, where it is not. Towards the end, a scientist checks her data and experiences what every scientist dreams of: the moment of discovery. There was always more to the Large Hadron Collider than hunting the Higgs boson, and the exhibition explores the questions the lab and its thousands of researchers will ask over the next 20 years. Those will be the life's work of another generation, the young researchers who follow in the footsteps of Higgs and his contemporaries.
