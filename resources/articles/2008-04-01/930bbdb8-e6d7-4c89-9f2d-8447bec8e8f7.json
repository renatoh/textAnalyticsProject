Abu Obaidah al-Masri, thought to have been a senior operational planner for the group, is believed to have died of hepatitis in Pakistan. \"There is compelling reason to believe that Abu Obaidah is dead,\" a US counterterrorism official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. A British official said his death had been known to the security services for some time. Masri remained one of the most mysterious members of al-Qaida's inner circle. An Egyptian-born explosives expert in his mid-40s, he fought in Bosnia and Chechnya, before eventually becoming a field commander for the Taliban. He is thought to have led attacks against the US-led coalition in Kunar province, eastern Afghanistan before fleeing with other al-Qaida leaders into Pakistan. Some security officials believe he promoted contacts between al-Qaida and would-be jihadists in the UK. \"He was a major operational figure,\" another US official said. Officials declined to discuss where he died, but he was thought to be hiding in a remote region near Pakistan's frontier with Afghanistan. Masri escaped at least two assassination attempts. He was rumoured to have been killed after a 2006 missile strike on a village near the Afghan border. Nine months later, he escaped another missile attack on a madrassa in north-western Pakistan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
