Alisson was helped off during the 4-1 victory at Anfield after damaging his calf while taking a goal kick in the first half. Klopp confirmed the \u00a365m keeper will miss Wednesday\u2019s Uefa Super Cup final against Chelsea in Istanbul but must wait on the results of a scan on Saturday before discovering how long his first-choice keeper will be on the sidelines. The Liverpool manager said: \u201cThere is nothing negative to say about the game except for Ali\u2019s injury. That is not good for us, but we have to see how serious it is and then we have to deal with it. It is the calf. He couldn\u2019t carry on and that is not a good sign. He will not play on Wednesday, I can say that already with all my experience. A tear? Maybe but you cannot say that without the scan. He is injured for sure. We have to see how much.\u201d Alisson was replaced by recent signing Adri\u00e1n in the Liverpool goal but with young goalkeepers Caoimhin Kelleher and Vitezslav Jaros both injured, the former West Ham player is Klopp\u2019s only available option at present. Former Bolton keeper Andy Lonergan joined Liverpool on their pre-season tour of the United States and Liverpool may be forced to look for a free agent depending on the length of Alisson\u2019s absence. Klopp added: \u201cKelleher broke his hand and is back in training but is not 100%. Varos had an elbow injury. We are a bit short. Adri\u00e1n is a very confident guy. He didn\u2019t want to sit only on the bench for the next couple of years. He made himself ready but in a situation like this you want someone who has played the league, is ready, a calm guy good with his feet which is really important for us. But we don\u2019t want a situation where one goalie is fit.\u201d The Liverpool manager, however, was otherwise satisfied with his team\u2019s performance on the opening night of the new Premier League season. \u201cIf someone had said before the game we would have won 4-1 I would have taken it easily,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd that we would have played the first 60 minutes like we did I would have taken it. We played an opponent who will cause problems, the way they play is really good. They are cheeky as hell.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
