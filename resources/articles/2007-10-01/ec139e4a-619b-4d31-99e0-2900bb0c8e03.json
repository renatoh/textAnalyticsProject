The Scott Trust, which owns the Guardian and the Observer, said he had presided over a \"period of sustained circulation and innovation\" at the newspaper. He will be replaced by John Mulholland, who will take over from Alton having been deputy editor since 1998. In an ever-more competitive Sunday marketplace, Alton oversaw the move to the Berliner format and introduced a range of award-winning magazine supplements. Following the move to the new format, the Observer was named Newspaper of the Year at this year's British Press Awards. Liz Forgan, chair of the Scott Trust, said the award \"was a fitting tribute to an inspiring editorship\". She said his replacement was \"an outstanding journalist\" who was \"uniquely placed to lead the paper into an era of digital publishing\". Alton, who hands the reins to Mulholland ahead of next year's move to a new building in King's Cross that the Observer, will share with the Guardian and Guardian Unlimited, said it had been an \"immense privilege to edit the Observer and work with such a brilliant team\". Twice named editor of the year, Alton, who is 60 in December, joined the Observer from the Guardian, where he had spent more than 20 years in roles including features editor and assistant editor. \"The Observer is in fantastic shape, editorially and commercially, and this is the right time for me now to be handing over to John. I am absolutely thrilled at his appointment,\" he said. Mulholland, 44, said: \"I, along with the superb team at the Observer, will be doing my utmost to carry on the wonderful work that Roger has done and to ensure that a paper with such a unique and cherished history continues to produce journalism that we can all be proud of in the future.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
