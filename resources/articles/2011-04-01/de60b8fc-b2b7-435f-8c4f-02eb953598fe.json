Toulon, who are fighting for a place in the Top 14 play-offs, have one match of the regular season to go. They could rip up Henson's temporary contract, but the Wales centre has been angling for a two-year extension. His value to Toulon would be enhanced if he were available to play during the autumn World Cup, when Jonny Wilkinson and Matt Giteau will be with England and Australia respectively, but the reason for Henson moving to France in January was to put himself in contention for a place in the Wales squad for the tournament. \"Henson has an attitude which has been difficult to manage,\" said Boudjellal. \"I have investigated what happened because I want to make an objective decision and I think I know what happened. It's a disappointment because he is a great player, but sometimes those who are a cut above hit rock bottom.\" Brunel looks Italy bound Italy have thanked their coach, Nick Mallett, for the historic first win over France by telling him his services will not be required after the World Cup. Perpignan's coach, Jacques Brunel, preparing his side for next the Heineken Cup match with Northampton next Sunday, is likely to take over. Mallett, who succeeded Pierre Berbizier following the 2007 World Cup, wanted to continue but even the win in Rome last month has not persuaded the Italian Rugby Federation (FIR) to extend his contract. The Frenchman has been linked with the position since the start of the year, when it is believed the FIR made its initial \"informal\" approach. Although no deal is thought to have been signed the 57-year-old is expected to sign a deal at the end of the season. \"I've thought about it for many weeks but this Italian offer is unique at my age,\" he told L'Equipe in January. \"It will certainly be the last [job] that I can take on. I want to seize this opportunity.\" one deck of header pls Contrasting fortunes for France's two Heineken Cup semi-finalists. Toulouse, who meet Leinster in Dublin this Saturday, hammered Bourgoin 33-0 to secure their place in the Top 14 semi-finals but Perpignan slumped to a 43-12 defeat against Toulon, the team who knocked them out of Europe earlier this month. Jonny Wilkinson kicked 17 points for Toulon, who have now moved up to fifth in the table. Toulon's Australian flanker George Smith, meanwhile, is expected to join the London Wasps fly-half Dave Walder in a move to Japan at the end of the season. Mitchell out for the year The Wallabies winger Drew Mitchell is set to miss the World Cup after suffering a serious ankle injury. Mitchell dislocated his right ankle during the first half of the Waratahs' 19-15 defeat to Queensland Reds. The 27-year-old, who has won 55 caps for the Wallabies, was considered a certainty for Robbie Deans's World Cup squad after enjoying a fine year for Australia in 2010. \"He'll be gone for the year,\" said the Waratahs coach, Chris Hickey. \"It's a pretty significant injury.\" one deck of header pls Leinster regained second spot in the Magners League table and boosted their chances of a home semi-final in the play-offs with a 20-8 victory over Aironi in Viadana.
