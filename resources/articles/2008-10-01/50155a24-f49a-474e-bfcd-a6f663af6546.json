While most children look forward to a break between lessons, many pupils with special educational needs (SEN) feel vulnerable and anxious at break times, lunchtimes and while moving between classrooms, researchers found. The study by Cambridge University's Faculty of Education and the Foundation for People with Learning Disabilities (FPLD) argues that children with SEN should be given more access to \"safe\" areas, such as libraries, or have access to support, supervision or guided activities outside of lessons. The recommendation is among those made in a new report - What about us? \u2013 looking at how to improve the experiences of students with learning difficulties in mainstream education. Government policy is increasingly geared towards teaching students with SEN in mainstream settings, but researchers warned it could lead to problems for young people with learning difficulties if not properly implemented. The research team worked with nine different institutions in three separate parts of the country including mainstream schools, further education colleges, an independent post-16 vocational training college and a special school. SEN students helped the researchers identify problems with their place of study and devise initiatives to tackle them, which boosted their confidence, skills, status and esteem, the researchers said. Many of the SEN students said that they found school life particularly difficult between lessons. Moving around campuses in busy corridors or on staircases was stressful and they felt vulnerable and insecure in playgrounds during breaks. Young people should be given more support and secure or structured activities during break times to solve the problem, the study found. For instance, some of the schools had common rooms offering pupils with learning difficulties somewhere quiet where they could talk to friends. Another offered students access to a learning centre, where they knew they could go for support from familiar and trusted members of staff when needed. Researchers also found that young people with learning difficulties wanted more opportunities to influence the day-to-day running of their school or college through representative bodies such as student councils. The report says it was \"noticeable\" that young people with learning difficulties were not included on these bodies and that in some cases participants in the research did not even know their school or college had a student council. When they were consulted for their views, however, simple obstacles that were affecting their wellbeing \u2013 such as a ramp that was too steep for wheelchairs, or sinks positioned at the wrong height \u2013 were often quickly resolved. Young people also want to be more involved in the planning and decision-making around transitions in their own lives, such as when they move from school to college, or enter the world of work. The report says students often feel anxious about major changes, but were much more confident when visits, \"link courses\" and work placements were laid on to help them move from one institution to another. While the young people believed the government's inclusion policy was a good one, it needs to be translated and put into practice more effectively, said the lead researcher, Richard Byers, Cambridge University lecturer in special and inclusive education. \"Schools are very busy places and are naturally concerned about challenging and developing all their students,\" he said. \"In most of the successful schools and colleges we worked with, however, it was clear that it was entirely possible to drive towards excellence and include young people with learning difficulties at the same time.\" Jill Davies, FPLD's research programme manager, said: \"Hopefully the findings will encourage schools and colleges to get their students with learning difficulties more actively involved in research and development work geared to improving their own experiences of mainstream education. \"Students can provide a very effective check on policy implementation and quality. \"Involving them in this way is good for schools, colleges and policy makers \u2013 as well as being good for the young people themselves.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
