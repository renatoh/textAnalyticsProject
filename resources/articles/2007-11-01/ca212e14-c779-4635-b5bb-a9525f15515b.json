PensionsFirst says its products can match all or any part of a scheme's liabilities, provide complete immunisation from risk, analyse all scheme-specific risks including longevity and access a new source of \"scaleable\" capital. A key part of the package will be the issuing of longevity bonds, tailored to each scheme's individual liabilities. To protect the intellectual property behind the scheme, PensionsFirst has filed a patent application. Amelia Fawcett, PensionsFirst chairman and former vice-chairman and chief operating officer of Morgan Stanley's European operations, said PensionFirst's suite would put \"defined-benefit schemes back on the table\". The news will be welcomed by unions who have been major supporters of final-salary - or defined-benefit - schemes, which provide employees with a more secure means of retirement income. Research carried out by Pensions First suggests there would be a significant appetite for precise liability-matching products; 73% of equity analysts said a cost-effective, scaleable solution would be superior to current risk-management products such as liability-driven investment and bulk annuities. \"Our initiative introduces scaleable debt capital to the DB market for the first time, providing flexibility and cost efficiency to the management of DB risk,\" Ms Fawcett said. \"Our products, which have global application, will be capable of immunising all DB exposures including longevity, on a scheme-specific basis.\" But not all are convinced PensionsFirst has found a silver bullet. \"There's quite a lot of spin in this and talking it up,\" said Tom McPhail, head of pensions research at broker Hargreaves Lansdown. \"Given what's happened in the credit markets, talking of immunisation against all risks is something that should promote caution. They're claiming to have come up with this magic formula that will turn base metal into gold and we've learnt to be wary of such claims over the years. I can't see much which is likely to stem the tide of DB closures.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
