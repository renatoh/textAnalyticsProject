But we do live in that kind of world.\" Cheney continued: \"One of the tremendous assets we have as a nation is the all-volunteer force, where people sign up and serve in the United States military to go in harm's way and to take those risks on behalf of the rest of us.\" It's true that these young men and women were volunteers, but they presumably signed up in the belief that they would not be misused as instruments of a reckless and incompetent foreign policy. They believed that, if they were put in harm's way, it would be to make America safer. While Cheney's remarks were tone-deaf, it was Bush's response that is more troubling. It suggests the idea that the deaths of these 4,000 can somehow be given meaning through military victory, that their sacrifice can be redeemed through the destruction of our enemies. This is a lie. In the years since 9/11, Bush, Cheney and others have relentlessly manipulated America's grief and stoked our fear for political ends, evoking the memory of those murdered on that day to justify a series of counter-productive policies. They did this to get America into Iraq, and they've continued to do it to keep us there. The modern American usage of \"waving the bloody shirt\" comes from the post-civil war era, when northern Republicans would evoke the memory of secession in order to evoke civil war hatreds and paint southern Democrats as disloyal. It is a way of closing off debate in favour of a particular political agenda, usually one of conflict. The symbol of the \"bloody shirt\" as a rhetorical weapon, however, actually originates in Islamic history. In 656, after the murder of the third caliph, Uthman, and the accession of the fourth, Ali, members of Uthman's Umayyad clan hung Uthman's blood-stained shirt from the pulpit of their mosque in Damascus as a way to stoke the crowd's hatred against Ali and his followers. There followed the schism between the majority of Muslims, who became known as Sunni, and those who followed Ali, who became known as Shi'at Ali, the partisans of Ali. Thirteen centuries later, America has, in a sense, been drawn into a continuation of this conflict. There is fighting between and within Muslim sects, with leaders on every side using the sacrifice of the martyrs to fan the flames of conflict. Bad leaders have always used memories of the dead to promote more war. But we do not honour the dead by creating more of them. We do not honour them by avoiding questions over why they died, or by refusing to honestly examine the policies that resulted in their deaths, or by abandoning debate over the past and future of the war in which they gave their lives. For the loved ones left behind by America's 4,000 dead, it is doubtful there is any outcome that could possibly merit their sacrifice. The best honour we can give to the 4,000, and to the tens of thousands of Iraqis who have also died in this war, is to bring it to an end."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
