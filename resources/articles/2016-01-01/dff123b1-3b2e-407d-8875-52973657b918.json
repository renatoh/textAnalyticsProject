The 2008 FA Cup winners play host to Bournemouth in the fourth round on Saturday with Pompey\u2019s opponents now operating several levels above their south-coast neighbours despite meeting in League One only three years ago. Fifty-seven places separate them and the achievements of the traditionally smaller club is an inspiration. \u201cI think if you look at our fanbase and support the reality is we probably are bigger,\u201d Cook said. \u201cIf you look at history, the likelihood is that we probably are. But if you look at where we sit today, we are definitely not. There is an argument for both sides. \u201cYou have to take your hats off to not just Eddie but the people who took them from a dark place to where they are now. When you drop an anchor and can\u2019t go lower or get worse, for the majority of clubs the future is bright.\u201d That is certainly the case at Portsmouth. They presently reside in the League Two play-off places, seven points off an automatic promotion spot but with games in hand. The team are settled and recently strengthened while off the field they are back on a solid footing. \u201cOur dark days are definitely behind us,\u201d he added. \u201cOur support has not wavered in any shape or form. Without getting into the past too much, we are on a forward curve now. How quickly we go forward remains to be seen.\u201d As for Howe\u2019s example, Cook said: \u201cI\u2019m struggling to get out of League Two at the moment, I\u2019m not even thinking about following him.\u201d But it is easy to draw parallels between the two managers. Both are wedded to similar playing philosophies and refuse to divert from them no matter the calibre of opposition. Cook has some decisions to make over his starting XI but promises whoever gets the call to play will stick to the side\u2019s attacking principles. It could make for a thrilling spectacle. \u201cWe have the exact same belief in terms of playing style here,\u201d he said. \u201cBournemouth will find we won\u2019t park the bus. We didn\u2019t at Ipswich [in the previous round], and we have very similar beliefs in how the game should be played. If you get beat, you move on and that\u2019s one of things that stands out for me about them \u2013 how they manage disappointment. They never wallow in it, they move on.\u201d Fratton Park will be sold out for the third time in 11 days, following the third-round replay win against Ipswich Town and last Saturday\u2019s 1-0 League Two defeat to Oxford United. For Cook this is a testament to the club\u2019s unwavering supporters. \u201cIt\u2019s great credit to the people of Portsmouth that the last three games have been sold out coming to the end of January when money is tight,\u201d said the 48-year-old. \u201cThe ticket office has had people turning up every day.\u201d Naturally there has been plenty of big-game excitement around the city this week, but Cook conceded one eye is already trained on Tuesday\u2019s long trip to Morecambe. \u201cThe likelihood is the Bournemouth game will take care of itself but the Morecambe game will be a lot more difficult fixture in terms of the mental side of the game,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can give a good account of ourselves and get our fans off their seats we\u2019ll go home happy.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
