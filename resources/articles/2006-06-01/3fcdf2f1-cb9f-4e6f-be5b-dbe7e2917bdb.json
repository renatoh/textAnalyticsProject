On the WinFS Team Blog, Microsoft program manager Quentin Clark put a positive spin on the news: Microsoft had chosen a different \"packaging strategy\", and the WinFS technologies would be used in products such as SQL Server instead. But, he had to admit, \"these changes do mean that we are not pursuing a separate delivery of WinFS, including the previously planned beta 2 release\" (http://tinyurl.com/km37t). So Windows XP and Vista users will never find a WinFS folder on their desktops, either as part of the operating system or an optional 30 megabyte download. Mercy killing The mercy killing caused remarkably few ripples, possibly because hardly any Windows users have a clue what WinFS is, or was, and certainly won't miss it. Oddly, the news seemed of much more interest to Mac users: in 2004 Apple boss Steve Jobs picked up on one aspect of what Microsoft had promised for WinFS - the desktop search - and boasted about delivering it first as the Spotlight search feature in Tiger, the release of Mac OS X that appeared in April 2005. Given the limited search features that will appear in Vista without WinFS, he will turn out to have been mostly right. Another reason why the demise of WinFS aroused little wailing was that we have seen it all before. In the 90s, before Microsoft released Chicago (aka Windows 95), it was also working on a new operating system called Cairo. Cairo was to have an Object File Store (OFS) with virtual folders. It never appeared. OFS was followed by Storage+, which never appeared, then by the Relational File System (RFS), which never appeared. WinFS was different, because by this time it was a relational database sitting on top of Windows' New Technology File System, not a replacement for it. Basically, WinFS sucked the data and metadata (such as a photo's exposure speed or a document's creation date) from the Windows Documents and Settings folders into a giant SQL (structured query language) database. From the inside, this looks a lot like a file system, as long as we overlook the fact that it contains many things that aren't files. From the outside, it isn't: all the files are still there, in folders, on your NTFS hard drive. A simple analogy is to compare it to a music library viewed in Media Player or iTunes. The songs are in the library and you can search and sort them via metadata (such as name of artist) that isn't part of the file name. But the real MP3 files are still there, in the file system, probably scattered all over your hard drive. The three big ideas behind WinFS were to unify storage, make it searchable, and make it accessible to applications. Unified storage meant things like songs, photos, word documents, email messages, calendars and so on could all be held in the same database. Programmers could stop developing storage systems for different applications - like the scary PST files used by Outlook - and everyone could use WinFS instead. That's why it was considered, until 2004, a pillar of Vista. Being based on the next version of Microsoft's SQL Server, WinFS has powerful search facilities. And a search produces a list of \"objects\" such as photos and Word document files and \"persons\" (a data type in WinFS), not directory listings of where the files were when they were last indexed. All in all, it sounded good. Lacking traction But using WinFS is another matter. In theory, you could take the \"contact details\" objects and extract contact data to define a group of customers, then filter that against company sales data in a different application to find those who spend more than \u00a31m a year, find the emails you hadn't answered from these high-value customers, display their photos as a timeline in order of birthdays, then save the search and use it again later. But the chances of ordinary users - for whom WinFS was supposed to be designed - doing that seem rather small. WinFS, unlike desktop search, is a platform. Without developers building on it, creating applications like Life Journal, which Microsoft demonstrated, it would probably never get used. There has been some speculation that WinFS was killed because it was one of Bill Gates's pet projects, and they no longer have his protection because he is stepping down from an active role at the company. But a more likely explanation is this: Microsoft delivered a working beta of WinFS last August, and it sank like a stone. The WinFS team made a four blog posts in the first five months of this year, attracting a total of 36 comments. Microsoft also has a WinFS newsgroup on Usenet with few users. WinFS is a technology without any traction. Under the circumstances, giving it to the database guys looks like the right thing to do. It could still have a future, if delivered transparently as an online service - especially since it has built-in synchronisation to work as a distributed database. Microsoft could, for example, deliver on the promise of WinFS by combining data from multiple desktop and notebook PCs in one searchable online store, while leaving your \"real\" files intact. People might even pay for that. \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
