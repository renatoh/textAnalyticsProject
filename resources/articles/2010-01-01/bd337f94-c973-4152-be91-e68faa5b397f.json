South Africa have won their last three Tests against England at Newlands, their fortress ground. The 32-year-old Ntini, though, has struggled for pace and penetration in the Tests in Centurion and Durban and has taken just two wickets \u2013 both during England's first innings in the first Test \u2013 for 233 runs. But, ultimately, the decision on Ntini, who has also struggled in domestic cricket, where his speed has waned, may not be taken by the selectors. Even though Gerald Majola, the chief executive of Cricket South Africa, has attempted to dismiss suggestions that there is political pressure to pick the bowler, it is understood that the selectors have made an unwritten commitment to include at least one black African in their team. The only other candidate is the left-armer Lonwabo Tsotsobe, who has played in three one-day internationals. But Tsotsobe's medium pace is considered too gentle for Test cricket. Micky Arthur, the South Africa coach, said: \"I guess Makhaya hasn't performed as he would have liked over the last two Tests. We've got to look at what is our best possible attack to take 20 wickets. We're 1-0 downand we need to take 20 wickets to win this Test match. We've got to look at what our best options are. It's the same with any icon cricketer. You tend to give them a bit of a longer run because they deserve it, because they have earned it. Makhaya has certainly earned it.\" Ntini's bluntless is all the more noticeable because Dale Steyn and Jacques Kallis have not been at their best following injury while Paul Harris looked less effective when the England batsmen went after him. But even if Ntini is dropped it may be no more than a short-term move, with political pressure demanding his reinstatement. \"We had a pretty serious discussion after the Durban Test,\" said Arthur. \"It's certainly not panic stations but we asked a lot of questions. The one thing we can take out of it is that we didn't play a lot of Test cricket in 2009. We felt that in 2008 we got on a roll where guys knew exactly where they stood and the results went accordingly. So we're hoping 2010 will be good for us.\" Arthur praised Graeme Swann, the man of the match in each of the first two Tests, as being \"probably on a par with Daniel Vettori as the best finger spinner in world cricket at the moment.\" He added: \"He's really bowled exceptionally well through the first two Test matches. It's going to be up to us to counter that and certainly to be positive is one way of doing that.\" The other South Africa player under pressure is JP Duminy whose place, like that of Ntini, appeared to be secure just a year ago. Arthur, though, seems in the mood to stick with his top six, despite the fact that his team were bowled out for just 133 in 50 overs in Durban. \"I back JP hugely,\" he said. \"I think JP's an unbelievable talent. This time last year he was on top of the world and it was always going to happen that he was going to face a little drop in his career. \"It's how quick and how mentally strong he can stay to come through this. And I know he will. Technically, there is one little issue we're working on. Other than that he's technically very sound. It's a matter for him to get through this mentally now and I've got full faith that he will.\" South Africa's top order collapsed to 50 for six in the second innings in the second Test, with only two specialist batsmen reaching double figures, in a passage of play that effectively handed England victory. \"There has been a lot of speculation around several places and that's understandable after such a poor performance,\" Arthur said. \"But as far as our top six batsmen are concerned, I back them completely and I am convinced that they are the best we have. They have performed for us in the past and I back them to do it again.\" Andy Flower cautioned that England were \"nowhere near\" winning the four Test series. \"South Africa are a very proud cricket nation and we know they will come hard at us from the first ball on Sunday,\" said the England coach. \"There's a lot more hard cricket to be played.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
