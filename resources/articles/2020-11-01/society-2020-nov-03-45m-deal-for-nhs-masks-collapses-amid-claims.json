The Department of Health and Social Care paid its supplier Purple Surgical upfront for 5m FFP3 respirator masks, which were supposed to have been flown into Birmingham international airport by June. But Purple Surgical, a Hertfordshire-based company that has signed deals worth almost \u00a3250m with the DHSC since the pandemic began, has been unable to supply the masks. Purple Surgical has filed papers in California alleging fraud by its own supplier, a company in the British Virgin Islands (BVI). The legal battle in San Francisco lays bare how the DHSC became embroiled in a global market for PPE reliant upon chains of suppliers and subcontractors, in this case stretching from the Caribbean to Hong Kong and South Korea. Purple Surgical\u2019s case in California is against Win Billion Investment Group, a BVI company that had promised to supply the respirators. In April the government agreed a contract with Purple Surgical for \u00a345m worth of 3M Aura 9332+ FFP3 masks, a medical-grade respirator, to be delivered in mid-May. Purple Surgical then signed its own $27m (\u00a321m) deal with Win Billion for 5m of the respirators. A chain of emails submitted as evidence to the California court by Purple Surgical reveals that the deal began to falter almost immediately. In early June, Win Billion said it had received a first payment of 35% of the funds and that the goods were awaiting inspection. The next day, however, the company said documents relating to the order would be ready \u201cwithin five days\u201d. After a further delay on 8 June, Purple Surgical\u2019s chief executive, Robert Sharpe, warned Win Billion: \u201cI MUST have this information by midday tomorrow as I have a call with the UK Govt at 1.00pm and they are expecting hard information.\u201d According to court documents Purple Surgical requested updates on the respirators throughout June, only to be advised of further delays. One delay in early June was \u201cdue to some banking delay on the transfer for the down payment\u201d, while another said Win Billion\u2019s distributor had been affected by \u201ca shortage of the raw materials and \u2026 overwhelming orders due to the Covid-19\u201d. Win Billion\u2019s Hong Kong-based chief executive, Ric Wu, also provided Purple Surgical with emails purporting to show explanations for the delays sent from 3M to Win Billion\u2019s distributor. The first, dated 18 June, read: \u201cI am glad to inform you that your shipment to UK will be ready on the 25th this month and reach Birmingham airport before the 30th, we will forward you all the document once its available, again we sincerely apologise for the delay.\u201d In August Purple Surgical launched legal action against Win Billion, citing non-delivery of the masks. The company also claimed that, despite an agreement that the remaining 65% of the money would be held back until the masks had been inspected, it had since been informed that only $1m remained in the escrow account. Jody Wong, the California lawyer hired as an escrow agent to transfer the money between the two companies in stages as the order progressed, denied any wrongdoing and said funds had only ever been disbursed from the account to secure production of the respirators. \u201cTo me it\u2019s just a business transaction and they\u2019re waiting for the goods,\u201d he said. He added he had not yet received any fee for his role. \u201cI don\u2019t know the reasons why it took so long,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel bad for everybody, because they should get their masks.\u201d Win Billion\u2019s South Korean distributor denied involvement, though it subsequently claimed to have also been the victim of a fraud by yet another company. 3M said it had had no involvement in the transaction as described in Purple Surgical\u2019s legal papers. \u201cReferences to 3M as part of the underlying transaction in the matter you described are entirely fraudulent,\u201d said Jennifer Ehrlich, a spokesperson for the company. \u201cNone of the distributors and principals you mentioned have a relationship with 3M or are authorised distributors of 3M products.\u201d Ehrlich said more than 7,700 cases of fraud involving fake 3M PPE had been reported to the company during the pandemic. She said 3M had advised the British government in June that this particular order was unlikely to be legitimate. Sharpe said Purple Surgical still intended to fulfil the DHSC\u2019s order, but would repay the full value of the contract if unable to do so. \u201cWe are deeply distressed by the suspected fraud that has been committed against Purple Surgical and, by extension, the NHS,\u201d he said. He added that the company had fulfilled 95% of its UK government contracts despite the unprecedented pressures of the pandemic. A DHSC spokesperson said: \u201cWe have been working tirelessly to deliver PPE to protect our health and social care staff throughout the pandemic, and proper due diligence is carried out for all government contracts and we take these checks extremely seriously. \u201cWe cannot comment directly on individual allegations of fraud, but we take all allegations seriously and explore every available option to bring those who commit fraud to account.\u201d Win Billion has filed a motion for Purple Surgical\u2019s case to be dismissed. However, the company\u2019s lawyer said his client would formally deny the allegations should the case proceed. \u201cWin Billion Investment Group Limited and Wu Yun Fai Rick [Ric Wu] deny any fraudulent intent at any time in this transaction,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
