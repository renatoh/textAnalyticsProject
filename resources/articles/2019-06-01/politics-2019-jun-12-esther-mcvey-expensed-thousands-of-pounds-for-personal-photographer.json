The MP has submitted claims worth \u00a38,750 for the services of the photographer and PR man Jonathan Farber in just two years, according to an analysis of data held by the expenses watchdog. McVey \u2013 whose website is adorned with photographs of herself \u2013 hired Farber, an ex-Tory councillor in her constituency in Cheshire. One receipt obtained using freedom of information laws from May 2018 shows that Farber invoiced McVey \u00a3750 for five hours\u2019 work for two shoots including \u201cedits, image processing and travel time\u201d. One of the shoots featured McVey, who was a broadcaster and businesswoman before entering politics, showing her support for paddle boarders joining the fight against plastic waste. The other was for a Women\u2019s Institute shoot and talk. The invoice is from \u201cJonathan Farber photo, video &amp; consultancy\u201d, and states McVey is being billed for \u201ccomms consultancy\u201d, adding: \u201cFixed rate retained professional photo, video and communications services.\u201d McVey, who takes home an annual salary of \u00a379,468 as an MP, says she is standing in the Tory leadership race as a \u201cpublic servant\u201d, but is an underdog, with only a handful of MPs publicly backing her campaign. McVey\u2019s expense claims could prove controversial with her colleagues. In 2018-19, she claimed \u00a36,000 for Farber\u2019s services, and \u00a32,750 in 2017-18. In total, McVey has submitted claims for Farber\u2019s services on 13 occasions, the majority of which describe his work as \u201ccomms\u201d or \u201cconsultancy\u201d. All of the claims were approved by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa), which said: \u201cCommunication is a large part of an MP\u2019s role and they are able to claim professional services to support them carrying out their duties. This could include photography to be used on their website and other digital and print communication channels.\u201d Although some other MPs have claimed for professional photography, most have done so for significantly smaller amounts than the sums McVey has disbursed. On his LinkedIn page, Farber says he does \u201cvisual communications\u201d for McVey. He was a town councillor in Knutsford from 2015 to May 2019. His website states that he charges \u00a3125 an hour for private photography and \u00a3175 for \u201ccommercial press/PR photography\u201d. In March last year, Farber\u2019s PR firm, WA16, posted a picture of the MP on social media, adding: \u201cA gritty press shoot here with Rt Hon Esther McVey MP with @highwaysengland just hours before the snow began to fall.\u201d In February 2018, the account posted another picture of McVey standing with a group outside Alderley BioHub, which houses laboratories, in her Tatton constituency. McVey\u2019s leadership bid centres around her belief in what she describes as \u201cblue collar conservatism\u201d, which champions \u201cworking people\u201d. As a minister in the Department for Work and Pensions in 2013, she said during a debate on the rising use of food banks: \u201cIt is positive; people are reaching out to support others in church groups, community groups, local supermarkets and other groups. \u201cIn the UK, it is right to say that more people are visiting food banks, as we would expect \u2026 Times are tough and we all have to pay back the \u00a31.5tn of personal debt, which spiralled under Labour. We are all trying to live within our means, change the gear, and ensure we are paying back all the debt that we saw under Labour.\u201d She has been criticised during the leadership contest for repeatedly stating that parents should be allowed to take primary-aged children out of lessons on same-sex relationships. It came after controversy over protesters, including parents, demonstrating outside the gates of a Birmingham primary school against LGBT teaching. The 51-year-old served as the MP for Wirral West from 2010 to 2015 before losing her seat. She was re-elected in the former chancellor George Osborne\u2019s old constituency, Tatton, in 2017. Asked about her expense claims, McVey told the Guardian: \u201cIt is all about constituency matters. Linking and communicating with my nearly 80,000 residents is the job of an MP, and that\u2019s what I do. In a modern era you have to reach out and communicate with all ages and I do that by writing letters, organising meetings or visits and through video and photos. \u201cIt\u2019s about raising awareness of key local matters in the constituency such as bus services or plastic pollution and the environment, as you rightly mention, but there are all manner of issues we deal with. These issues impact all my residents, youth and community groups, businesses and charities, and I communicate with them all in various ways. This is totally within the Ipsa rules and regulations and has been declared openly.\u201d Farber did not respond to a request for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
