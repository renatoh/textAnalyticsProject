It is most often used to cover activities that would be better classed under \u201cminor indulgences\u201d or \u201cacts of selfishness so profound I need to obfuscate my sociopathy immediately\u201d. But sometimes it means something closer to self-preservation. It is in this sense that I wish to advise you that \u2013 short of going out and licking a coronavirus patient\u2019s mucus membranes \u2013 to not watch Channel 4\u2019s documentary The Country That Beat the Virus would be the greatest act of self-care you could perform at this time. Because \u2013 and I\u2019m sorry to be the bearer of bad news \u2013 that country is not the UK. I know that this week the British prime minister \u2013 while announcing a revised lockdown policy that could only have been transliterated from a spilled tin of Alphabetti Spaghetti \u2013 claimed that we had avoided catastrophe, but, in the face of more than 40,000 dead, a flailing, heartsick populace and looming economic meltdown, this is a) not true and b) not beating the virus. The situation in South Korea, however, has been very different. Its death toll from coronavirus, out of a population of 51 million, compared with the UK\u2019s 67 million, currently numbers 259. The programme\u2019s format was simple yet effective, taking us painstakingly through two chronologies. The first was in South Korea, where patient zero was identified on 19 January as they arrived at Seoul airport from Wuhan, caught by the airport\u2019s heat scanners, installed as part of measures devised after previous epidemics. This triggered a comprehensive pandemic plan across the country. And one here in Britain: a timeline starting 10 days later when we noticed we had let someone arrive direct from Wuhan, by then known to be the centre of the new, highly infectious virus, and had done precisely nothing until they had had a good chance to walk around and establish the thing here. Krishnan Guru-Murthy interviewed (via video) various public health experts and journalists from the UK and South Korea, and policymaking scientists and frontline doctors from the latter (ours being largely still otherwise engaged). The difference between the two responses was breathtaking, damning and humiliating \u2013 by turns and sometimes all at the same time. Most viewers, of course, will have gleaned the basics of what happened there versus what happened here. The massive programme of testing, contact tracing and quarantine that made up the South Korean containment strategy is pretty much common knowledge. But to see up close and in detail how it all worked together, to be presented with a clear picture of the scale, the decisiveness, the confidence and competence that characterised that response gave you a new understanding of what is possible and \u2013 given the lead time we had \u2013 what should have been expected and executed here. Once both nations were infected, the programme interwove the two timelines and largely left them to comment on each other. The effect was unedifying. We would turn from descriptions of, say, how the South Koreans commandeered chemical companies and had testing kits for Covid-19 ready within 17 days, to footage of our prime minister advising that bliffle blaffle and hobblobblob because bulldog spirit and jimminy jummo. Without ever even needing to lock down, South Korea crushes the infection rate. When it spikes \u2013 for example, when the virus infiltrates a secretive Christian sect of which the authorities were unaware \u2013 they countermove to crush it again. You can nitpick. Their powerfully successful contact tracing scheme relied, basically, on state surveillance \u2013 they were able to access phone and credit card data and work backwards through any infected person\u2019s life and outwards from any point along it. We\u2019re a different country with a different population distribution and history. Those initial testing kits were only 90% accurate. Doubtless there will be fallout. Yes. Yes. But it is very hard not to look at the end results and say that the means were not justified. Difficult not to look at 259 deaths versus more than 40,000 and not agree that desperate times call for desperate measures rather than desperate bluster. But we are where we are. Here. Unswabbed, untested, unsure and unsafe. So, you know, um, ah \u2026 er \u2026 stay alert?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
