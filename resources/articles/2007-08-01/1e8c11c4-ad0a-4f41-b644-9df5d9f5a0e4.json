The culprit was said to be a Channel 4 Dispatches documentary, Undercover Mosque, which was broadcast in January. The programme 'completely distorted' the meaning of the Islamic clerics and speakers featured in its investigation. This was the message repeated across the media. Both Sky News and the BBC referred to earlier TV scandals, implying that Dispatches was guilty of the kind of dubious practices now associated with unscrupulous game shows. It was no surprise that the allegation received such widespread attention because it was made by no lesser authorities than the West Midlands Police and the Crown Prosecution Service. In what appeared to be an unprecedented move, the two bodies issued a joint statement condemning Undercover Mosque and announcing that the West Midlands Police had referred the documentary to the broadcasting regulator, Ofcom. Furthermore, the statement made clear that the police had asked the CPS to look at bringing a prosecution against the programme makers for stirring up racial hatred. Only a regrettable shortfall in evidence stood in the way of criminal charges. Quite a story, then. The only problem is that the real story should have been about the alarmingly censorial and quite possibly libellous attack on investigative journalism. No matter, on Radio 4's PM programme, it was Dispatches' commissioning editor Kevin Sutcliffe who was subjected to a grilling, while Abu Usamah, one of the subjects of the documentary, was portrayed as a harmless victim. Usamah was 'totally appalled', he said, that Channel 4 had misrepresented his efforts to foster multicultural harmony. Usamah was not asked to cite any examples of misrepresentation. Nor was he confronted with the recordings of his sermons broadcast in the documentary. Now that would have made for a compelling piece of radio. For here is Usamah spreading his message of inter-communal respect and understanding, as captured in Undercover Mosque: 'No one loves the kuffaar! Not a single person here from the Muslims loves the kuffaar. Whether those kuffaar are from the UK or from the US. We love the people of Islam and we hate the people of kuffaar. We hate the kuffaar!' 'Kuffaar' is a derogatory term for non-Muslims. The police and CPS suggest that comments like these were taken 'out of context'. I've read extended transcripts of Usamah's quotes and I'm satisfied that they were perfectly 'in context'. But let's ask what conceivable context could make these quotes acceptable or reasonable? Was he rehearsing a stage play? Was it a workshop on conflict resolution? Or perhaps it was the same context in which a spokesman from those other righteous humanitarians, the BNP, might attempt to aid community relations by repeatedly stating that his followers 'hate Muslims'. Yes, you can well imagine their excuses if they got caught at it: 'No, we don't really hate Muslims, we just want them to leave the country.' Except no one in the media swallows it, much less gives them air time. But then, as CPS lawyer Bethan David observed, Undercover Mosque had been 'heavily edited'. She 'considered' 56 hours of footage and yet, instead of producing a two-day Warholian extravaganza of non-events and incidental conversation, Channel 4 deviously reduced it to a one-hour documentary. For those of you who may have gained the impression that the CPS is suffering under a mountainous workload, it's reassuring to see that one of its lawyers has a spare two weeks to spend watching film out-takes and also time to branch out into TV criticism. As a novice to the game, she may not have realised that this is how documentaries work. You shoot a lot of footage and concentrate in the final edit on your core story. In this case, it was the hatred being preached in the supposedly moderate Green Lane mosque in Birmingham. And there was no shortage of material, much of it available on DVDs sold openly at mosques around the country. Nevertheless, the producers of Undercover Mosque offered a right of reply to Usamah and the other preachers. All in all, it was an exemplary piece of investigative journalism. And as far as anyone knows, none of those featured in the film made official complaints. So why have the police taken up their case? Here we have to look at how the West Midlands force first became involved. They initially gained a court order to review Channel 4's footage with the aim of prosecuting the Islamic clerics for incitement. Channel 4's concern was only to expose the extremist attitudes demonstrated by some supposedly moderate preachers. It never thought there was a criminal case. And it was proven right. This left the police and CPS with an expensive and time-consuming operation and no prosecutions, much less convictions. It also left them with a number of angry local community leaders able to complain of discrimination and intimidation. It's worth remembering that the West Midlands police force is sufficiently sensitive to community relations that before one anti-terrorist operation, they first informed Dr Mohammed Naseem, who believes the 7/7 bombings may have been a British security services plot. How then to regain the trust of the 'community'? In Bethan David's words: 'The CPS has demonstrated that it will not hesitate to prosecute those responsible for criminal incitement. But in this case, we have been dealing with a heavily edited television programme, apparently taking out of context aspects of speeches that in their totality could never provide a realistic prospect of any convictions.' The suggestion seemed to be that if the programme could not produce material with 'a realistic prospect of any convictions', although that was never its purpose, then it should not have been broadcast. It's a zero-sum game. If the filmed can't be nicked, then it has to be the film-makers. The assistant chief constable (security and cohesion) of West Midlands, Anil Patani, also appears to have followed this line of thinking. In a letter to Channel 4 chief executive Andy Duncan, Patani wrote: 'It is clear that Undercover Mosque had an impact in the community and the cohesion within it.' And someone has to pay for that undefined impact. 'We hate the kuffaar' is not a statement best designed for community cohesion, but whose fault is that - Abu Usamah's for saying it or Channel 4's for recording him? Patani seems inclined to the latter view. 'The priority for the West Midland Police,' said Patani in the joint statement, 'has been to investigate the documentary and it's [sic] making with as much rigour as the extremism the programme sought to portray.' Such a richly illiterate sentence perfectly captures the police's pig-headed, irresponsible and sloppy handling of the whole affair. Since issuing the statement, both the CPS and police have refused to explain themselves or provide any evidence to support their allegations, apparently drawing their ideas on bureaucratic accountability from the works of Kafka. Dispatches boasts an impressive history of tackling Islamic extremism. In Kill or Be Killed, it filmed Abu Hamza lecturing young Muslims on how to bring down a plane at Heathrow, when the rest of the media were still treating him as a caricature. And Trouble at the Mosque showed how young men armed with baseball bats took over Luton mosque. Dorothy Byrne, who commissioned these programmes, recently asked Metropolitan Police Commissioner Ian Blair why the police did nothing about these cases. Blair replied that the police had sent files to the CPS, but they decided to take no action. Perhaps they were too busy referring TV programmes to Ofcom. \u00b7 Andrew Anthony's The Fallout: How a Guilty Liberal Lost His Innocence is published by Jonathan Cape on 6 September"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
