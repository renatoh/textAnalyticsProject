Gilbert's subject matter may be routine (1970s board games such as Mousetrap and Buckaroo), but what he does with it is something else. A comic with his own voice (that's saying something these days), his latest one-man show, Who's Eaten Gilbert's Grape? is inspired by the film What's Eating Gilbert Grape? \"Gilbert Grape's life had taken a slight detour. Rhod Gilbert's has fallen asleep at the wheel and driven into a ravine.\" If you can't make the last night of his solo show in Oxford, you can see him doing his regular club set in London and Manchester, an act that he's honed to a tee by putting himself out there. He's played comedy festivals as far afield as Montreal and Cape Town, and he's entertained the British troops in Afghanistan and Basra, including a spot at Saddam Hussein's old palace. Even compared to the Comedy Store, that's got to be a tough gig. \u00b7 Comedy Store, SW1, Sat 24; Tattershall Castle, SW1, Sat 24; Jongleurs Battersea, SW11, Sat 24; The Cellar, Oxford, Mon 26; Comedy Store, Manchester, Wed 28 to Dec 1 Maxwell's Fullmooners London A few years ago, live comedy seemed to be stagnating. What began as an anarchic revolt against conventional light entertainment had ended up as something just as staid. Club comedy was booming, but you knew what you were going to get: three or four stand-ups, all doing 20 minutes. Lately, something's changed. Comics are staging freeform happenings, trying out new ideas, and Maxwell's Fullmooners is a perfect case in point. This open-ended club night started out at London's Comedy Store, then went to the Edinburgh Festival, and now it's at Alexandra Palace for one (late) night this week. First class Irish comic Andrew Maxwell hosts the fancy dress event which will be held in the venue's old Victorian theatre, where he will be joined by Terry Alderton, Simon Munnery, Phil Nichol, Peter Serafinowicz and Glenn Wool. \u00b7 Alexandra Palace, N22, Sat 24 Stick It Up Your Junta London Being a comic in Burma is no laughing matter. The country's most popular comedian, Zargana, known as the Burmese Charlie Chaplin, was arrested during the recent uprising, and previously banned from performing after giving an interview to the BBC. In the late 1990s, a double act called The Moustache Brothers were imprisoned after performing at the home of the leader of Burma's National League For Democracy, Aung San Suu Kyi. They were given seven years hard labour for spreading \"false news\" and sent, in shackles, to break rocks in a labour camp. Following an international outcry they were finally released, but one of this duo, Pa Pa Lay, is currently under arrest for showing support for Burma's monks during the latest unrest. Seasoned comic John Gordillo is directing two nights of character comedy to raise funds for the Burma Campaign UK. Fittingly, it's called Stick It Up Your Junta. Dig deep. \u00b7 The Venue, WC2, Thu 29 &amp; Fri 30"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
