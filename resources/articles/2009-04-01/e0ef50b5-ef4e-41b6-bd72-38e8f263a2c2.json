For years he has been going about his business, filling what he calls his \"niche\" in the second row, doing anything but tart up his game of rugby. Gough chases kicks hard, hits rucks harder, tackles opponents hardest. He is the boring front jumper to whom the ball is thrown when all fancier options have failed. He has won 59 caps for Wales as their honest Joe. But ask him about today's Heineken Cup quarter-final against Munster and the old boy cannot help reaching into the phrase book of the modern Ospreys. \"This is all about re-integrating well, re-focusing, re-motivating and re-tasking,\" he says. He means it. He re-means it. Gough and a whole string of the region's players went through a pretty dramatic and ultimately unsuccessful Six Nations campaign with Wales, regathered as Ospreys and were derailed by Gloucester in the semi-final of the EDF Energy Cup. Now they face the defending champions at Thomond Park in Limerick. Perhaps the only place to hide is in jargon. \"No, no,\" counters Gough. \"There's no better place to go (Limerick, that is, not the jargon). I mean it. Backs to the wall, and all that. It's another massive knock-out challenge.\" I don't suppose a professional contract has ever been offered to a player who, on the balance of reason, says that it simply is not worth turning up. But is there no sense of impending doom here? No gulp? No admission, however unspoken, that when it comes to playing away in Munster the glass sort of stares at you half-emp ... \"I'm ever buoyant,\" Gough interrupts. \"Sure, we were disappointed at where we finished with Wales. Fourth, that's not where we wanted to be. But, for me, we were a team that was seconds away from winning the Triple Crown. And after the disappointment of the Gloucester game, what could be better than a chance to put things right straight away?\" But this is Munster away. Don't you worry about what might happen? \"I worry by nature. It's good to worry. It gives you a good mental edge.\" The fact is, though, that for all their potential on paper and for all their positive attitude, the Ospreys time and time again fail to be the sum of their many glittering parts. Does not that frustrate the true epitome of the team player, who slaves away unselfishly so that the collective may prosper? Gough stops. \"White boots wouldn't suit me,\" he says. \"And on this business of not getting things right, I'll say two things. First, nobody hurts more than us. But we have to pick ourselves up and learn the lessons, and quickly. We've got an early chance to put a lot of things right. Little things: finishing off moves we start, being clinical with our decision-making, running better support lines. \"Second \u2013 and I don't care who we're playing or where \u2013 we've got a big game coming. I don't mean the fixture, but a performance. We're so close to cutting loose. So close. You want to see what these boys can do in training. I know people say: 'So what, it's only training...' but I promise you we are on the brink of something special.\" For the Ospreys to do the unthinkable and beat Munster away won't a few more of their players have to do what Gough does and take himself to the edge of medical safety with his energy-draining commitment? \"I very rarely suffer cramps now,\" he counters. \"It's a lot more technical now. I'm a sweater by nature \u2013 a buoyant, sweaty worrier, that's me \u2013 but we all have a re-hydration strategy now. \"Where were we? Oh yes, this thing about us having to change a lot in a short space of time. Well, not so long ago, there we were as Wales being beaten by Fiji and on our way home from the World Cup. When the next Six Nations started did anyone give us a chance? But within 10 days we were off on the grand-slam trail. It just shows what can be done. \"After the Gloucester game we all got together. The players, that is. We'd be in a dream world if we thought there was anyone else to blame. We've got guys at the Ospreys with a lot of All Black caps; a lot of Welsh caps. Plus, we've got youngsters. And we all said the same thing: it's up to us to sort this out. \"We know what we have to do. We've analysed the things that seemed right when we made the decisions last time out, but that were plain wrong when we saw them again. And we've worked at them, adjusting, getting the groove right.\" You have the feeling with Ian Gough that he cannot be laid low on any subject. It is not entirely clear if he would be in the Wales or Ospreys team if Ian Evans were fit to partner Alun-Wyn Jones in the second row. On countless occasions the curtain has been about to fall on his career. But each time it seems he has been left out for the last time, back he comes, more determined than ever, more willing to plough up and down, more inclined to hurl himself at the pain barrier. He looks as if he is in constant pain, which he probably is, but he is a disciple of the old maxim that if he distributes more than he receives in the way of pain and discomfort then the day will be won. For that reason he will hit the next ruck, rattle the bones even of Paul O'Connell and Donncha O'Callaghan. There are duels to be fought today. Of course, as the ultimate unseen team-player he tends to stand out in a line-up of dazzling individuals. If the potential of the Ospreys is ever to be released then Ian Gough should have a starring role. Not in flashy white boots perhaps, but with the streak of a stubborn old so and so who never quite knows when a cause is lost."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
