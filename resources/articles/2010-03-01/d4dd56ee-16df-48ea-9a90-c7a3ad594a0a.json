Don't read on if you haven't seen episode 10 \u2013 and if you've seen more of the series, please be aware that many UK viewers may not have done so \u2026 Will Dean on episode nine \"Well he knows how to leave a room.\" Danny Farrell We know that Don's veneer is cracking, but tonight we see just how far. After leaving the key to his mystery drawer in his dressing gown, Betty hears it rattling around in the tumble drier (rumbled by the consumer goods \u2013 O Fortuna!). She's smiling as she opens Don's chest with it, but what she finds knocks her off her feet: pictures of Don marked \"Dick\", a divorce certificate and a bond for a house for Anna Draper and Dick and Don's dog tags. Fittingly, just as Betty discovers the Whitman family, Don is trying to atone for the death of his brother by reaching out to Suzanne's sibling Danny (True Blood's Marshall Allman), who is getting in the way of his affair. Danny seems resigned because of his epilepsy but Suzanne manages to sort out him out with a job in Massachusetts. As Don drives him there, he reaches out and encourages him to pull himself up (like Don did) before doing the right thing and letting him go his own way. \"I swore to myself I would try and do this right once,\" he says, as he hands him his card for emergencies \u2013 a lifeline he never gave to Adam Whitman. Little does he know that at home, Betty is riding a wave of anger and waiting to confront him, entirely unaware that Don is betraying her in a different way at Suzanne's. By the time he does return at 5.30pm the next day, she's not got the energy for the battle. At the Sterling Cooper party, there's some wonderful wordless acting from January Jones as she non-listens to Don's speech and thinks: \"Who the hell is this man?\" The episode is called The Colour Blue and Suzanne and Don's early post-coital chat about perception of colours \u2013 \"How do I know if what I see as blue is the same as it it to you?\" \u2013 feeds through to Betty's discovery. She's been seeing Don as \"blue\" for all these years \u2013 but he's a completely different colour. \"Wearing a dress isn't going to help you with Western Union.\" Kinsey After her shellacking from Don a few weeks back, Peggy proved her skills as a copywriter tonight and left Paul Kinsey reeling at the same time. Despite having improved the \"Paul Kinsey Theatre\" Aqua Net idea in front of Don, Paul takes the easy view that Peggy's only got where she is because she's a woman and pits himself against her as they think of Western Union campaigns. While Peggy is diligently committing her ideas to tape \u2013 Don-style \u2013 Kinsey is getting pissed, looking at his old Playtex triumph and listening to jazz to drum up some inspiration. When it does finally strike after a conversation with janitor Achilles (\"Achilles, I have thought of something very, very good\"), he promptly falls asleep before writing it down. Thankfully due to a combination of Kinsey's knowledge of Chinese proverbs (\"The faintest ink is better than the best memory\") and Peggy's ad instincts they produce a great idea together. Kinsey's reaction to Peggy's skill \u2013 \"By ... god\" \u2013 was perhaps the most gratifying moment of series three. Perhaps the office's self-styled liberal might now realise that there's more to Olson than just a skirt. And that also that she's just better than him. A final point \u2013 I loved Peggy's assumption that \"talk to Achilles\" was some kind of classical euphemism that went over her head. If only, eh Paul? \"We finally have an answer to the question, what makes Don Draper smile?\" Lane Pryce A quick note on the potential sale of Sterling Cooper. Only Lane knows so far but PPL are using the 40th anniversary party as a way to advertise the agency to buyers. Let's deal with this when we know the details but the chat between the two (literally) disenfranchised ex-owners was rather telling \u2013 particularly Cooper's introspection and Roger's growing contempt for the leapfrogging Don. Did we know that Roger had picked him from a fur factory and introduced him to fellow wedding-cake topper Betty? Notes \u2022 A triptych of great lines for Lane: \"Am I to entertain your ballad of dissatisfaction?\"; (On it not being England) \"I've been here 10 months and nobody's asked me where I went to school.\"; and (on his gig speech) \"Churchill rousing? Or Hitler rousing?\" \u2022 Poor Jane in the car with Roger's mother. First mistaken for Margaret before Roger is asked ... \"Does Mona know?\" \u2022 What with Suzanne's brother's epilepsy, Guy's foot and Sal's sexuality, Mad Men certainly does a good job of sticking two fingers up to equal-opps/H&amp;S recidivists. \u2022 After the phantom call, did anyone notice Sally's under-her-breath \"Jeez, Louise\"? \u2022 Don keeps a supply of dry-cleaned shirts in his office drawer. \u2022 Plenty of great shots: I loved Betty closing the study door before we cut straight to Suzanne opening the front door to let Don in. Culture Watch Betty is reading Mary McCarthy's The Group in the bath. Here's a wonderful piece by Elizabeth Day about the impact of the book on women like Betty."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
