Coulson, Brooks and six other co-defendants arrived at the Old Bailey on the first day of their trial on charges linked to an alleged phone hacking conspiracy and an alleged conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office. All eight have pleaded not guilty. A panel of approximately 80 potential jurors was called to court 12 and told the case could last up to six months. The judge, Mr Justice Saunders, acknowledged that such a length of time could cause significant disruption in people's lives but said jurors would need powerful reasons to be excused. The judge said: \"The trial concerns allegations of criminal conduct at the News of the World and Sun newspapers which preceded the closure of the paper.\" Brooks, the ex-editor of the Sun and now defunct News of the World, and Coulson, also a former editor of the NoW, faced the massed ranks of the media outside the central criminal court as they arrived at 9am. Brooks, 45, from Churchill, Oxfordshire, who resigned from News International in July 2011, faces five charges spanning more than a decade, including one charge in relation to allegations of conspiracy to hack phones. She has denied the charge and two further allegations that she conspired with others to commit misconduct in public office. She has also pleaded not guilty to two charges that she conspired with others to pervert the course of justice. Coulson, 45, from Preston, Kent, who quit Downing Street in January 2011, is facing three charges in relation to his time as editor of the News of the World. He has denied two charges relating to an alleged conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office. He has also pleaded not guilty to allegations linked to a phone-hacking conspiracy on the paper. Brooks's racehorse trainer husband, Charlie Brooks, 50, has pleaded not guilty to one charge of conspiring to pervert the course of justice, as has her former personal assistant at News International Cheryl Carter, 49, and News International's head of security, Mark Hanna. Ian Edmondson, 44, the former head of news at the News of the World, and Stuart Kuttner, 73, former managing editor of the paper, each deny one charge in relation to a conspiracy to hack phones. Clive Goodman, 56, the former royal editor of the News of the World , denies conspiring with Coulson to commit misconduct in public office. Brooks sat in the glass-panelled dock between Edmondson and Coulson with the remaining defendants \u2013 Kuttner, Goodman, Carter, Charlie Brooks and Hanna to their right. Addressing the large pool of potential jurors, Saunders said: \"The trial which we are about to start will take a considerable length of time. It is estimated that the case may last until Easter. I hope that with the assistance of counsel the case will finish more quickly. But people who sit on it should be prepared for the case to go on that long.\" Those not immediately excused were asked to complete a questionnaire to further assess their suitability to try the case, with a final panel of 12 expected to be selected on Tuesday. \"The trial concerns allegations of criminal conduct at the News of the World and the Sun newspapers which preceded the closure of the News of the World,\" Saunders said. The aim of the questionnaire was to eliminate any potential jurors who might have personal knowledge of activities at the paper at the time or might find it difficult to approach the trial with an open mind.\" Saunders warned the panel: \"It's critical to the jury system that a jury takes the case free from any preconceptions. From now on you do not discuss the case with anyone.\" He also instructed them not to look up anything about the case because if they did it may make it difficult, if not impossible, to be impartial. \"You are not to talk about it, do not look anything up on Google; search engines; tweeting,\" he added. Those selected must try the case only on the evidence they would hear, he said. He reminded those left that being a jury member was \"is a public duty and is not voluntary\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
