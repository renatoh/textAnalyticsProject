Private school pupils still have head start in sports", "bodyText": "The education watchdog, Ofsted, has called on state schools to urgently improve the quality of competitive sport they offer, warning that it was \"average at best\" in many and that private schools continue to dominate at elite level. In a report published on Thursday, it urged the government, schools and sports governing bodies to do more to improve the \"unacceptable\" proportion of state school pupils succeeding at the top level in many major sports. Ofsted said that in the minority of state schools that took sport seriously, academic performance was improved. Despite fewer than one in 10 pupils attending fee-paying schools, more than four in 10 of the British athletes who won medals at London 2012 were schooled privately. Alongside the success of state-educated athletes including Jessica Ennis, Mo Farah and Greg Rutherford and cyclist Victoria Pendleton, half the gold medal winners were educated privately, including cyclist Chris Hoy and sailor Ben Ainslie. Ofsted's research shows that the pattern is repeated in almost every sport outside football. The majority of players in rugby union's Premiership went to fee-paying schools, as did more than a third of those playing county cricket. England rugby captain, Chris Robshaw, was educated at Millfield and cricket captain Alastair Cook attended Bedford school. \"It simply cannot be right that state-educated athletes are so woefully under-represented in our elite sports,\" said Sir Michael Wilshaw, Her Majesty's chief inspector of schools. \"Heads who treat competitive sport with suspicion or as an optional extra are not only denying youngsters the clear dividends that come with encouraging them to compete, they are also cementing the social inequality that holds our nation back.\" Ofsted found a correlation between the quality of competitive sport provision and wider academic achievement. It called on schools to expect all pupils to compete in competitive sport and ensure there was provision to meet demand, embed sport in the \"school ethos\" and foster meaningful links with local and professional sports clubs. It also said the government should put in place a national strategy to improve the number of athletes making it through to the elite level from state schools. School sport became a political battleground in the run-up to the London Olympics after the education secretary, Michael Gove, scrapped \u00a3162m in annual ringfenced funding for a national network of school sport partnerships. Following a prolonged backlash, the government agreed to replace it with a \u00a3150m scheme targeted at primary schools, which gives each one around \u00a312,000 a year to spend on sports coaching or facilities. The Ofsted report said that too few state schools recognised the wider values that competitive sport could bring. Only 13% of headteachers said they expected all pupils to take part in competitive sport and only four in 10 said they regularly played sport outside school. While Wilshaw said the achievements of the best state schools showed \"large playing fields\" were not a prerequisite, the report did little to address the disparity in facilities and coaching between private and state schools. John Steele, chief executive of the Youth Sport Trust, said the findings highlighted the \"worrying inconsistency\" in the provision of competitive sport in state schools. \"Access to facilities and investment in specialists to deliver sport are key factors in the success of independent schools,\" he said. \"If we are to continue to counter this trend, state schools must develop stronger links with local clubs which can offer support, expertise and, importantly, the facilities for young people to develop and excel.\" The report says schools should take care to differentiate their competitive sport offering from physical exercise. But Steele said it was also important that a mix of both competitive sport and non-competitive exercise was offered. \"Schools shouldn't be judged on their competitive school sport provision alone as it is important for them to be able to deliver a balanced programme of high quality PE, alongside adequate opportunities to participate in different sports,\" said Steele, also a former Rugby Football Union chief executive. \"We believe that this balance, young people will not be afforded the best chances in sport or in life.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
