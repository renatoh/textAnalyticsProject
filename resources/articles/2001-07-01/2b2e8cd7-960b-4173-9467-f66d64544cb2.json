The aim of the liquidator, which wrote to the remaining policyholders last night, is to put a lid on future liabilities of Independent to give greater certainty to the collapsed company's creditors. PwC's forensic accountants are yet to establish the scale of Independent's potential losses but so far have raised \"tens of millions\" for potential creditors, predominantly through selling assets. Yesterday PwC raised \u00a33m and secured 300 jobs by selling Independent's loss adjusting arm to Royal &amp; Sun Alliance. After sacking 1,000 employees last month, the liquidator pledged yesterday that no more redundancies were imminent. Daniel Schwarzmann, joint liquidator, admitted yesterday that PwC did not have a precise figure for how many policyholders Independent Insurance had. He refused to discuss controversial reinsurance contracts taken out by Independent Insurance. There is uncertainty about precisely how many such deals the insurer had done with the General Electric arm Ireco to protect itself against future losses. Some policyholders will be covered by the Policyholders Protection Board. PwC is prepared to negotiate with those who do not have termination clauses in their policies in an attempt to reduce Independent's future risks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
