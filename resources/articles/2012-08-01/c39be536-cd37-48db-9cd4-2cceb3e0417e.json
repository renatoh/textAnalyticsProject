The 32-year-old passed a medical examination and agreed personal terms on a four-year contract at Loftus Road as QPR's comfortable victory over Walsall was overshadowed by news of the imminent signing of a player who won the Champions League with Internazionale two years ago. \"It's not a done deal yet, there are still some papers to go to and fro but we'll be delighted if it goes through,\" said Hughes, who foresees no complication with the formalities. C\u00e9sar will earn a net annual salary of \u00a32m and his arrival will constitute QPR's most forceful statement of intent in a summer in which they have already signed eight players and let 13 perceived lesser ones go. The goalkeeper, who has won 64 caps for his country, was a crucial component of the Inter team that became European champions and attracted many suitors this summer despite Inter demoting him to a back-up following their purchase of Slovenia's Samir Handanovic from Udinese. Hughes said that \"the opportunity to sign him only arose in the last couple of days and when you get a chance to sign a player of that quality, you have to pursue it to its conclusion\". That spells bad news for another of QPR's recent signings, Rob Green, who committed a costly error during his debut against Swansea City 11 days ago and now must fear a long stint on the bench looms. \"I will sit down with Rob and talk him through it,\" said Hughes. \"What we're trying to do here is improve the quality of the group and pose challenges to everyone.\" C\u00e9sar is unlikely to be QPR's last recruit before the transfer window shuts as Hughes presses on with his radical revamp of a squad that avoided relegation on the last day of last season. He declared that a centre-back remains his top target. \"That was the plan at the start of the window and is the one area that we haven't been able to address but we'll keep looking at options right up until the window closes,\" said the manager, whose first choice is Tottenham's Michael Dawson. Hughes also indicated that Joey Barton proposed move to Marseille may yet go through after an initial setback. \"It may not be dead in the water,\" said Hughes. \"This option has attracted Joey's enthusiasm so hopefully something can be done.\" Amid all the haggling at Loftus Road, Hughes will be glad his team disposed of Walsall with little fuss. Shaun Wright-Phillips opened the scoring in the 29th minute, poking the ball into the net from six yards after a fine pass from Bobby Zamora. Early in the second half Green gave a reminder of why C\u00e9sar is likely to replace him, as the former England No1 fumbled a long range shot by Jamie Paterson early in the second half and Will Grigg headed against the crossbar from the resultant corner. Rangers secured their victory in the 66th minute when Zamora received a deft pass from Kieron Dyer and sent a chip over David Grof and into the net. On a night in which Alejandro Faurlin made a strong return after missing eight months through injury, Jos\u00e9 Bosingwa, crowned his home debut by adding a third goal in the 84th minute."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
