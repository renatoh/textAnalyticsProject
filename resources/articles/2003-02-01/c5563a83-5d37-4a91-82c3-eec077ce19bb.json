Peter Butler, an Irish surgeon working at London's Royal Free Hospital is planning to carry out the pioneering operation, which would transplant the face of a corpse onto a healthy child who has been badly disfigured in a fire. But it transpired today that Lena Marie Murphy, the girl named in the Irish Independent and subsequently in the Evening Standard, is not Mr Butler's patient. A member of the Murphy family said: \"The story is complete nonsense. The Irish Independent has printed a false story and we are consulting our lawyers. It's very upsetting.\" The Murphys, who live in the sleepy village of Borris, south of Dublin, woke up to a horde of reporters outside their door this morning after the story appeared. The operation has sparked a massive bidding war in another town where the real girl is believe to be living, with the News of the World, Mail on Sunday and the Daily Mail battling it out for exclusive rights to the story. \"There is a huge battle going on. I have been told by the girl's lawyers that the amounts of money being offered by the English newspapers is obscene,\" said one Irish journalist. The story is likely to be of worldwide interest - with the family's before and after story with pictures expected to be syndicated in America, Australia and the far east. The journalist believed the bidding may have got beyond \u00a3250,000. If the family decides to do a TV interview, the ante may be upped even further. The world's first face transplant is the subject of an intense international race led by Mr Butler and two American teams. The surgeon has renewed calls for a public debate on facial transplants because of resistance to the \"admittedly shocking concept of walking around with a dead person's face\". He says the procedure is relatively straightforward and carries only a small risk of failure. \"The technology is there, the biggest obstacle is public opinion and funding,\" he recently told the Sunday Times. Mr Butler insisted that a recipient will not look exactly like the donor because each person has a distinctive bone structure."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
