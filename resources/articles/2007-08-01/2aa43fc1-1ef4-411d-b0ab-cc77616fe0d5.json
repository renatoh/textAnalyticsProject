What was one of their brethren doing stepping out of the shadows to bask in the reflected glory of the bank's \u00a367m sponsorship deal? Surely he should be keeping a low profile and deflecting the attention of prying eyes like all the other super-rich City folk. But Mr Diamond, who tops the Guardian pay league with earnings last year of almost \u00a323m, has a long-running love affair with the press. While he may not be in the Richard Branson publicity league, compared to other bankers he is easily accessible. Bookish and determinedly polite, the American-born banker has the charisma that many others lack. He is also unapologetic about his rewards, arguing strongly that his pay and that of his staff is linked closely to performance in a way that many other FTSE 100 bosses would find uncomfortable. As day-to-day head of the bank's investment and fund management businesses, Barclays Capital and Barclays Global Investors, his basic pay was \u00a3250,000 in 2006. A performance-linked bonus raised that figure by \u00a310.4m. An executive share award scheme added another \u00a34.5m. A further \u00a37.7m comes in the form of share options. More than \u00a350m worth of Barclays shares also sit on his personal balance sheet. Mr Diamond is not chief executive of Barclays, but became president of the group when John Varley took up the reins as chief executive in 2005. Even then his pay was several times the sum paid to the chief executive. At the time he said: \"Ten years ago I don't think the UK was mature enough to accept performance-related pay.\" He claims that any jealousy inside Barclays has evaporated over the years. Union relations have eased, but this relates more to the bank improving pay for its cleaners above the \"London living wage\" of \u00a37.05 an hour and the pension scheme offered to all staff. Mr Diamond, now a British citizen, started life as one of nine children to parents who were both teachers. He graduated from Connecticut University, to which he has since donated millions of dollars, sponsoring a chair in women's studies, among other things. The excitement of bond trading in the 1980s, graphically documented by Tom Wolfe in his novel Bonfire of the Vanities, drew him into investment banking, he says. He joined Barclays stockbroking arm BZW in 1996, a few months after it bought the fund management and trading arms of Wells Fargo and Nikko Securities. To the outside world Mr Diamond, who had been a rising star at Morgan Stanley and then Credit Suisse, had joined a third-ranking British outfit. But he saw the potential of the San Francisco-based operations joining forces with London's BZW. A year later and Barclays Capital was born with its twin BGI. In subsequent years he encouraged the sale of structured debt packages to underpin takeovers. He used his experience as head of Asia and then global head of bond trading at Credit Suisse First Boston to expand the business in the far east, London and the US. As a result Barclays Capital and the fund management arm Barclays Global Investors, which has more than tripled its assets under management in recent years, rode the wave of cheap debt and contributed a third of the bank's profits last year with revenues up 20% at BarCap and 60% at BGI. But he now faces his biggest challenges. The sub-prime crisis in the US has spawned speculation that Barclays Capital has billions of dollars of losses sitting on its books from high-risk lending. Barclays denies the rumours, but they come at a time when confidence in the bank is paramount. Mr Diamond is the brains behind a plan to take over Dutch bank ABN Amro. Ebbing confidence could depress the bank's share price and hand victory to the rival bidder, Royal Bank of Scotland. Not the epitaph he is hoping to write."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
