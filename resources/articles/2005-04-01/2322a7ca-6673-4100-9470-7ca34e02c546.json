'So on behalf of everyone in the team, if there's anything we can do for you today ...' Obviously they could start by not talking, but no, they are already cheerfully distributing 'feedback' questionnaires to help them improve their service, though I can see from here it's just about ticking boxes, with no space to mention Tuesday's seasickness excursion to see the whales, which began with a circular, stomach-churning tour of eight other hotels in an unairconditioned wreck of a bus only to find that we could have walked it in 15 minutes, or for that matter to raise the issue of our hotel, who wouldn't let us push two tables together at dinner because wouldn't that teach us to arrive at one minute to nine with too many children? 'Just relax,' says my wife. 'I AM relaxed,' I say, returning to my holiday reading, the excellent if rather intellectually challenging for a package holiday Destiny by Tim Parks, since you ask, whose twin themes of suicide and air travel seem to sit happily with the moment, notwithstanding the author's slightly interminably long sentences, which though elegant and glittery with wit and cerebral conceits demand such heights of concentration as to be not entirely conducive to keeping one's ears alert to the pilot's views on Atlantic weather patterns and urgent calls regarding the imminent sale of snacks, beverages, crisps and nuts at far from competitive prices. 'Dad, can we have some Pringles?' the little one asks the minute the seatbelt signs go off, because although lunch is included, it's not included until they've stopped making us buy the contents of the cargo hold. I spend the last of our euros on a bag of Maltesers, but now the video screens are lit up and nattering on about what exciting holiday experiences we can look forward to next year. 'Headphones are available at \u00a32.50,' the woman is saying, 'for anyone wishing to see today's movie.' Excellent. And for those trying to read? Why, there's a further announcement that Darren or Warren or Gareth or Dareth will be soon coming round asking if we'll be needing any scratchcards at all today. Scratchcards? What next - double glazing? Flexible mortgages? Burial plots? Personalised stationery? No, though a range of alcoholic drinks will be available to ensure a steady flow of customers bumping into my elbow as they sway back and forth to the toilet. Yes, I suppose I manage a page or two in between the collection of rubbish and the arrival of lunch, but the loudness is now coming from the people behind, who have started their own cabaret featuring a song about donkeys' testicles that goes uninterrupted until eventually news breaks that the crew will be coming round to take orders for all our duty-free perfumes, aftershaves, sunglasses and ceramic figurines of obedient dogs. I sink into a short coma, waking some months later to find that we are in a taxi, speeding away from Stansted. Within moments we are home! The washing machine doesn't work and my wife comes running in with a bee in her hair. But there's still no place like it. phil.hogan@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
