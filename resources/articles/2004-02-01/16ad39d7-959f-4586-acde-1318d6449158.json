But it has resulted in a cheerful blaze breaking out at the Den. Millwall, already in the top half of the First Division, have now reached the Cup quarter-finals for the first time in 19 years and Wise, through his experiences with Wimbledon and Chelsea -where he won the Cup in each of the past three decades - can tell his charges all about matches such as these. He always appeared a most bizarre choice to manage a club, for as a player his undoubted skills were overshadowed by acts of boorishness that represented a liability for the many teams he played for. There were mutterings about lunatics and asylums when he was appointed. But he has impressed Burnley's hoary-handed manager Stan Ternent, who worked with Wise when he was Ian Porterfield's assistant manager at Chelsea. \"Dennis has organised the side,\" said Ternent, a manager since 1979. \"What is noticeable is the goals-against column. It looks very skinny. They don't give a lot away. \"He has a chairman, Theo Paphitis, who is go-ahead. Dennis won't be frightened to make the right decisions. And he won't want to be there to be liked. He'll do the job. And when he can't play any more, and takes a step back from it, he'll be even better. He'll turn the whole club upside down, get his own players in and if they don't play his way, they won't play. \"He's an international footballer who's played in FA Cup and European finals and won them. He's a fantastic footballer and he'll make a fantastic manager. He's been round the block, at 37. I think he old-headed a few people today.\" It is difficult to listen to Ternent without one's head filling with the awful image of a football team running out with Wise playing in every position and with, presumably, 11 referees to manage affairs. Ternent's \"old-headed\" reference was in connection with the number of free-kicks won by the former England midfielder. Wise also fell, as if shot, when pushed by Paul Weller, who was sent off after only 10 minutes as substitute. \"I'm not Ars\u00e8ne Wenger but I didn't see it,\" said Ternent. \"But I don't see how a push could be a straight card.\" Ternent, still bewildered after all these years, also failed to understand how another substitute, Alan Moore, missed the ball from two yards in injury-time when scoring was the easier option. \"You'll have to ask him,\" he shrugged. A replay, though, would have been more than Burnley deserved. Millwall completely dominated the second half and only a succession of outstanding saves by Brian Jensen kept his side in touch. Millwall's superior strength in midfield came not from Wise but from Tim Cahill and, playing wide on the right, Paul Ifill. The new signing Danny Dichio, though, was their match-winner with a 70th-minute header from Kevin Muscat's cross. Already Dichio has repaid a big chunk of that \u00a3500,000 - which could rise to \u00a3650,000 - that Millwall paid West Bromwich Albion for his services. \"It was nice from the club's point of view that they took a gamble and it paid off,\" Neil Harris, Dichio's partner up front, said afterwards. \"The fee may have been a bit over the top but he's here and that's the main thing. \"I thought we played very poorly but we are through to the quarter-finals of the FA Cup and most of us, including myself, have never got that far before.\" Man of the match: Tim Cahill (Millwall)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
