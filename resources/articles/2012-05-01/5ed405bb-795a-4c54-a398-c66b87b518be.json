In a speech to a Sutton Trust conference in London, on the eve of the launch of the government's social mobility strategy by Nick Clegg, the Labour leader will attack a \"narrow-mindedness\" that treats vocational subjects as second class. Miliband will say: \"Social mobility must not be just about changing the odds so that kids from poorer backgrounds make it to university. That really matters. \"But the debate has been too narrowly focused. We should reject the snobbery that assumes the only route to social mobility runs through university \u2013 as if there is only one pathway to success. We must have a better offer to those young people who choose not to go university.\" The Labour leader will criticise Britain's education system which treats vocational subjects as second class and will criticise the government for recently downgrading the value of the engineering diploma from five GCSEs to one. \"Ministers should show as much respect for young people whose skills secure them an apprenticeship as those who win places at university,\" he will say. \"The next Labour government will take those skills seriously. We need to ensure vocational education is seen as just as much of a gold standard as academic education.\" Miliband's speech will contrast with one of the central proposals in a social mobility review to be launched by Clegg on Tuesday. The deputy prime minister will highlight university as a key route to social mobility, by proposing a student premium to guarantee financial help for children on school meals entering higher education. The Labour leader will balance his criticism of those who frown on vocational qualifications by saying that opening up universities remains crucial to improving social mobility. \"I know how much more there is to be done to open those closed circles of Britain. Not just to the universities, but to journalism, law, finance \u2013 and politics too. \"There is so much to be done before everyone really has equal opportunities to enter professions which have been too closed to too many, for far too long.\" Miliband will make clear that Britain faces a long haul in improving social mobility. \"Tackling social mobility is a huge mountain to climb and the last Labour government took some important steps. \"But now Britain is sliding backwards. This government seems to think we can let those at the top take whatever rewards they think fit and somehow everyone else can just play catch-up. \"You can't claim the mantle of social mobility and then make your priority, cutting taxes for millionaires while raising taxes for everyone else.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
