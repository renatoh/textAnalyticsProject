Another post stated that people encountering a \u201cMarxist Democrat\u201d in public should \u201cget in their face do not give them peace\u201d, the Arkansas Democrat Gazette reported. \u201cThrow water on them at restaurants,\u201d the post said. \u201cPush them off sidewalks. Never let them forget they are traitors and have no right to live in this Republic after what they have done.\u201d Marshall\u2019s mayor, Kevin Elliott, said Holland apologized for causing trouble. \u201cI called in the Arkansas Municipal League [and] my attorneys,\u201d the mayor said, \u201cI got some advice on the steps I need to take and the proper direction I need to go. I called Mr Holland in, and he resigned as police chief.\u201d Holland held the role in Marshall, population 1,355, for two years. Elliott said he was surprised by the posts. \u201cHe\u2019s done excellent,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cI\u2019ve been with the city of Marshall for 26 years and, by far, he\u2019s been the best police chief that I\u2019ve ever seen. I don\u2019t [do] social media, but I was notified last night and all day today and got a bunch of posts and pictures to me.\u201d Arkansas\u2019s governor, Asa Hutchinson, a Republican, called the posts \u201cdangerous\u201d. After the posts started circulating on Twitter and Facebook, another Parler account with the username \u201cChieflangholland\u201d emerged, Arkansas\u2019s ABC 7 TV station reported. The new account claimed to be run by \u201cthe real chief\u201d and said the other account was a fake, the station said, posting screenshots on Twitter. By Saturday, neither account was live. The police department Facebook page appeared to have been taken down. Holland opposed a mask mandate in Arkansas, which is suffering under the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cI Chief Lang Holland feel this order is a very large overreach of the powers given to the state government by the citizens of the state of Arkansas,\u201d he wrote in a memo published to the department Facebook page in July. \u201cTherefore the Marshall police department will take NO enforcement action of any kind this includes arrest or citation by anyone who is not wearing a mask while out in public.\u201d On Monday, Holland could not be reached for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
