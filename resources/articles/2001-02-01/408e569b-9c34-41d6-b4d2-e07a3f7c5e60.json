After a dour first half, in which neither side looked like scoring, Dunfermline's Steven Hampshire made the breakthrough after 49 minutes. Six minutes later, Derek Lilley brought United back into the game from a Danny Griffin corner; but eight minutes from the end, United's defence was breached again, by substitute Marinus Dijkhuizen, and a minute later, another substitute, David Moss, made it 3-1. United's manager, Alex Smith, said: 'I thought the second goal was offside and should have been chalked off. The big Dutchman was in an offside position when the ball came back off the goalkeeper and it proved to be a crucial goal. I am disappointed because I didn't think we would lose by 3-1.' Dunfermline's manager, Jimmy Calderwood, said: 'It's nice for me to look at the bench and have players like Marinus and David available - it says a lot about the squad we have here. We scored three goals, and when you score three you deserve to win, but it was a battle and we can play a lot better.' Another late goal by a substitute - Derek Young - enabled Aberdeen, in the third-from-bottom spot, to pull farther away from St Mirren and United with a 1-0 win at Motherwell. In a poor match full of niggling fouls, Young struck eight minutes from the end. QUITE APART FROM Henrik Larsson and Chris Sutton, another striking duo under the scrutiny of the TV cameras today is the one involving St Johnstone's Nathan Lowndes and Keigan Parker against Kilmarnock. Lowndes was in excellent form at the time he was forced out of the team last March because of a back injury. Now, with the 18-year-old Parker having done much to make light of his absence, Lowndes - who marked his fourth match back in the side with a goal at Dundee United last week - is excited by the prospect of what they might achieve together. 'It takes time to get back to where you were after being out for as long as I was,' Lowndes said. 'But I feel fine, and if Keigan and I get more games, I am sure we can hit it off together.' Kilmarnock's manager, Bobby Williamson, insisted that his players would be as focused on this match as they were on last week's League Cup semi-final victory over St Mirren at Hampden. He said: 'We will be under pressure on Sunday - we will put pressure on ourselves because we want to win. This is the case every time our players put on the strip.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
