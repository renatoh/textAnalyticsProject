Every time I visited she'd want to kiss me. She dipped snuff and I hated that snuff so I begged my mother not to take me and then I'd remember the phonograph and then I'd change my mind. I'd put up with the kiss for the music. I must have been about 16 when I heard Blind Lemon. He had a way of playing that for a minute sounded like he was double timing but all of a sudden he'd slow it down and then something out of that music would sing like a sword piercing my heart. The one that turned me on to different styles The Original Guitar Wizard - Lonnie Johnson I always wanted to be like Lonnie Johnson. He came from New Orleans and isn't as celebrated as some of the bluesmen from the Mississsippi Delta, but I've said before that he had as big an effect on me as Blind Lemon. His playing [collected on this box set] was gentler, more sophisticated. He'd fit in well if he was playing country with somebody or if he was playing jazz with somebody. He played with Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong so how much further up can you go in jazz? And he played with Mahalia Jackson so how much further up can you go in gospel? The record that reminds me of my hero Midnight Blues - T-Bone Walker (1947) The first time I met him I was a disc jockey on a radio station in Memphis, Tennessee called WDIA. Everybody at the station knew I liked T-Bone and this particular day I heard somebody in one of the studios playing nice piano. I walked in and there was T-Bone Walker and I almost passed out! The first time I heard him play he had an electric guitar - one that was made to be electric rather than with a pick-up on it which was all I'd seen until then. I tried to copy his sound, and failed. But in failing, I managed to find my own sound. The one that helped break down people's prejudices Beggars Banquet - The Rolling Stones (1968) The Stones were superstars. I supported them on tour in 1969 and to be able to do something with them was a godsend for me. It probably didn't mean much to them, but it meant a lot to me. Keith [Richards] was always playing something and looking at me as if to say, 'You can't play this!' I loved working with them and I'd work with them tomorrow if they'd let me. The Stones opened a lot of eyes - white and black - because many people didn't know about the blues. I wanted them to think of it as music in the same way as I wanted them to think of us as people. The record that persuaded me to try something new Keep it Coming - B B King feat. Heavy D (1997) We used to have an old saying: try it and you might like it. I heard some of that Chinese music on the television from the Olympics and I loved it. I've never liked the lyrics that rappers use about women - all ladies to me are like angels. But as long as they aren't talking about hurting or killing people, I'm with them. You try rhyming everything you say and making a conversation that'll make sense. I made a record, Deuces Wild, with people like Eric Clapton and Mick Hucknall, and I did a thing with Heavy D and I enjoyed that experience. Strange and possibly true 1 Riley B King was born in rural Mississippi on 16 September 1925. He took the nickname 'Beale Street Blues Boy'- later shortened to BB - when he worked in Memphis as a DJ. 2 Rolling Stone magazine placed him third in a list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all-time. 3 Each one of his Gibson guitars has been called Lucille - after a woman who caused a fight leading to a fire that almost saw one of his earliest guitars incinerated. 4 A licensed pilot, vegetarian, non-drinker and non-smoker, King has had two wives and has fathered 15 children by different women. 5 This month, the BB King Museum and Delta Interpretive Centre opens in Indianola, Mississippi, the first such museum to be devoted to a living bluesman. \u00b7 BB King's new album One Kind Favor (Universal) is out on 29 September Listen to this playlist on Spotify"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
