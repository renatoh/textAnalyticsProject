But now there is no excuse for not knowing the plot of Don Quixote de la Mancha, Miguel Cervantes' 17th-century epic: the first animated version of the novel to make it into the cinema opens across Spain next week. Donkey Xote will open on 300 screens, a record for a Spanish cartoon animation. After five years in production, at a cost of \u20ac15m (\u00a311m), it is Spain's most ambitious animated film yet, and hopes to challenge Hollywood's domination of the Christmas market. Donkey Xote features stars of film, TV and radio as the voices of the eponymous hero, his faithful sidekick, Sancho Panza, and assorted animal companions as they set off to fight a duel in Barcelona over Don Quixote's beloved Dulcinea del Toboso. The adventures of Don Quixote may take up hundreds of pages in Cervantes' classic, but the film's producers have by necessity played fast and loose with the story in their adaptation. Squeezing the novel into 80 minutes, it gives starring roles to Don Quixote's trusty steed, Rocinante, and Sancho Panza's donkey, Rucio - who bears a striking resemblance to the donkey from the successful Shrek series, voiced by Eddie Murphy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
