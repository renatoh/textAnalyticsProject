The more serious of the vulnerabilities affects Sendmail, an open-source program for managing e-mail. The vulnerability lies in the way the e-mail server software parses e-mail headers, according to Dan Ingevaldson, engineering manager for Internet Security Systems in Atlanta,\" reports CNet. Comment: Yet another hole in Sendmail, the program implicated in the worst malware disaster ever to hit the Internet -- the Robert Morris worm, back in the late 1980s. If Sendmail had been a Microsoft product, they'd have fixed it a decade ago. Because there's a free version bundled with your average distro, this bit of security holeware continues to dominate the net, while the open source community remains embarrassingly unable to fix it.
