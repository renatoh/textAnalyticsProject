Usually Israel only demolishes a few homes per day, which doesn\u2019t get into the news. By our count, since 1967 this has totalled over 55,000 demolitions of homes and structures vital for living within the occupied Palestinian territories. In 99% of the cases Israel\u2019s demolition and displacement policy is in gross violation of international law. This forced displacement is cruel and results in crippling trauma for Palestinian families. Israel\u2019s demolition of Palestinian homes should be a cross-party issue for every single MP who cares about the rule of law and the future of humanity. We urge our government to call Israel to account. Linda Ramsden Director, Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions UK"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
