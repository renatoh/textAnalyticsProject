Peter Atkinson - who is quitting his post as the company's executive vice president - has paid back all the money he owed, Hollinger said today. The settlement means his name was omitted from a \u00a3700m suit filed on Friday against five Hollinger executives, including former chairman and chief executive Lord Black, his wife Barbara Amiel and former Telegraph chief executive Dan Colson. Mr Atkinson is staying to act as a consultant to Hollinger over an ongoing dispute with Canadian media company CanWest. He resigned as a director of Hollinger in November, the same time as Lord Black stood down as the company's chief executive when it emerged they and two other executives had pocketed allegedly unauthorised payments. Although Lord Black has continually denied any wrongdoing, his differences with the company have widened into a bitter legal war that saw 22 counts brought against him last week, including two of \"racketeering\". Mr Atkinson paid back \u00a3200,000 of the money he owed in November and December, and has now agreed to pay the remaining \u00a31.4m. This amount includes \"non-compete\" fees and payments made under the company's Hollinger Digital Management Incentive Plan. Hollinger said the funds would be held in an escrow account as it waits for the deal to be approved by a Delaware court. This is because Mr Atkinson has been named as a defendant in a suit filed by Hollinger minority shareholder Cardinal Value Equity Partners in December. Mr Atkinson stood down from the board of Lord Black's holding company Hollinger Inc in January, citing \"personal reasons\". \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
