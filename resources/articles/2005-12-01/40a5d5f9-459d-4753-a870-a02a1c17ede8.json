Sven-Goran Eriksson's side will face his compatriots Sweden as well as Paraguay and Trinidad and Tobago in group B. The draw in Leipzig saw England avoid the heavyweights of world football and Eriksson's side should be confident of progressing at least into the last 16. Sweden, who drew 1-1 with England in the 2002 group stage, will provide the strongest threat but Paraguay are perhaps the weakest South American side and Trinidad and Tobago the real minnows of the tournament. England's first match will be against Paraguay in Frankfurt on June 10, followed by Trinidad and Tobago in Nuremburg on June 15 and their final match of the first phase against Sweden in Cologne on June 20. The finals' opening match will be the group A match between hosts Germany and Costa Rica in Munich on June 9, while holders Brazil open their tournament against Croatia in Berlin on June 13 in group F. There were two very tough-looking groups - group C containing Argentina, Holland, Ivory Coast and Serbia &amp; Montenegro, and group F with Italy, the Czech Republic, Ghana and USA.
