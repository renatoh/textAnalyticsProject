It is not clear what legislation Morrison was referring to, with no major environmental bills currently before parliament, and the prime minister\u2019s office was not immediately able to clarify. As voters return from summer holidays Morrison attempted to reframe the Coalition government as the champion of \u201cquieter Australians\u201d, promising in a Daily Telegraph opinion piece that he \u201cwon\u2019t be dragged off to the right or left\u201d of politics. Morrison recounted a recent family visit to the Shoalhaven Heads hotel on the New South Wales south coast, an experience he said reminded him that Australians \u201cthink Australia is a pretty great place\u201d and are \u201ca lot more interested in everyday life\u201d than noisy political debates. The Coalition has resumed political hostilities with a promise to force councils to hold citizenship ceremonies on Australia Day \u2013 a move targeted at progressive councils who have attempted to move ceremonies to protest against the celebration of 26 January, the anniversary of European colonisation. Morrison attempted to allay fears the 2019 election will be fought on culture war issues, stating his respect for Indigenous Australians who \u201cwere here first\u201d and that Australians \u201chave nothing at all against migrants\u201d. He said the government should \u201ckeep population growth under control by getting the migration settings right\u201d but not \u201cshut the place down\u201d just because of fears of congestion. \u201cThose who want to hate don\u2019t speak for me,\u201d he said. Morrison told ABC News Breakfast that in April the Coalition would deliver the first budget surplus in more than a decade, framing the pending election contest as a choice between the fiscal responsibility of the Coalition\u2019s plan for record social spending and Labor\u2019s plan for \u201c$200bn of higher taxes\u201d. The prime minister said he was \u201cnot contemplating\u201d an early election. When parliament resumes on 12 February Morrison faces a number of tests which could challenge his control of the lower house, including opposition amendments to facilitate medical transfers from offshore detention and the government\u2019s policy to create powers to break up energy companies. Asked about the Coalition\u2019s priorities in the few sitting days remaining before the election \u2013 with just four parliamentary weeks scheduled before May \u2013 Morrison said: \u201cWe want to continue the momentum with the measures on national security. They have kept my focus.\u201d Government national security bills currently before parliament include those to make it easier to strip convicted terrorists of Australian citizenship and increase police powers to stop people at airports. Morrison said there were a \u201crange of remaining items\u201dto \u201cfinish off\u201d the government\u2019s program in 2019, citing \u201cenvironmental legislation \u2026 [that is] important for native species\u201d. The Coalition has been accused of having no policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions since Malcolm Turnbull ditched the emissions reduction component of the national energy guarantee. In the Daily Telegraph, Morrison said Australians \u201cwant to take care of our environment, especially locally\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re sympathetic to the big global environmental issues, because we really do care about the world we\u2019re leaving for our kids,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut we\u2019re not going to sign up to destroy our economy because of the extreme views of some.\u201d Morrison said the shift to renewable energy was \u201chappening\u201d and should occur without Australians \u201cbeing asked to pay higher taxes or shell out unaffordable taxpayer-funded subsidies\u201d. His government has refused to rule out indemnifying coal power against a future carbon price and is investigating options for the government to underwrite new power generation projects by promising to buy electricity at a minimum price. In a nod to his claim that Australia will meet its Paris climate targets of a 26-28% emissions reduction by 2030 \u2013 contradicted by the latest emissions data and climate scientists and economists \u2013 Morrison wrote, \u201cwe\u2019ll get there\u201d. On Monday Bill Shorten will visit Kakadu national park after he and Morrison both announced packages worth more than $200m to revitalise the world heritage-listed site."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
