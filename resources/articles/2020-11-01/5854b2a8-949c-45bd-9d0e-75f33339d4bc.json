The New York Times said there were twin New York investigations, one criminal and one civil. The criminal inquiry, led by the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr, and a civil investigation by the state attorney general, Letitia James, are just some of many legal challenges that will probably face the president and his family business when he returns to being a private citizen. The report provoked a sharp response from Trump\u2019s eldest daughter, who is a senior presidential adviser. \u201cThis is harassment pure and simple,\u201d Ivanka Trump said on Twitter, linking to the report in the New York Times. \u201cThis \u2018inquiry\u2019 by NYC democrats is 100% motivated by politics, publicity and rage. They know very well that there\u2019s nothing here and that there was no tax benefit whatsoever. These politicians are simply ruthless.\u201d The Times, which said the two investigations have subpoenaed the Trump Organization in recent weeks, follows publication of Trump\u2019s long-sought tax records and revelations that he personally guaranteed debt running into the hundreds of millions that could soon be called in or come due. Trump\u2019s financial and legal stresses appear to be mounting. Earlier this month, Reuters reported that Trump\u2019s main lender, Deutsche Bank, is looking for ways to end its relationship with the president. Deutsche Bank has about $340m in loans outstanding to the Trump Organization, the president\u2019s umbrella group that is currently overseen by his two sons. The loans, which are against Trump properties and start coming due in two years, are current on payments and personally guaranteed by the president, according Reuters. Among the latest revelations is that he reduced his tax exposure by deducting about $26m in fees to unidentified consultants as a business expense on several projects in the past decade. Some of those fees, the Times said, appear to have been paid to Ivanka Trump, including a payment of $747,622 from a consulting company that exactly matched consulting fees claimed as tax deductions by the Trump Organization. Trump Organization counsel Alan Garten described the development as \u201cjust the latest fishing expedition in an ongoing attempt to harass the company\u201d. Details of the twin investigations have been scarce. The Manhattan DA\u2019s inquiry was originally focused on Trump Organization payments to the porn star Stormy Daniels ahead of the Trump\u2019s 2016 election victory but has since expanded to include insurance and bank-related fraud, tax evasion and grand larceny. The civil investigation began earlier this year after Trump\u2019s former lawyer Michael Cohen told Congress that the president had boosted the value of his assets to secure bank loans and reduced them for tax purposes. In a TV interview this month, James, the New York attorney general, said the outcome of this month\u2019s election was irrelevant to the investigations. She said: \u201cWe will just follow the facts and the evidence, wherever they lead us.\u201d But Trump has dismissed the investigations as \u201cthe greatest witch-hunt in history\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
