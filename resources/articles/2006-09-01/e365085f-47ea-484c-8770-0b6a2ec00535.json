Nervous glances gave way to whoops of delight and it was not all down to the beer. This was a good day for the county, who will win the title with a win here. They chose to bat on an easy-paced pitch and at the close had scored 420 for five. Nottinghamshire require three points themselves to be free of relegation concerns but there was a lack of urgency about their cricket yesterday. Apart from a solid opening spell from the left-armer Ryan Sidebottom, whose first 10 overs cost 15 runs, there was a lethargy about the attack and the fielding was no better. Mark Ealham, recovering from tonsillitis, did not bowl. Sussex reached their maximum five batting points four overs before the close. And 15 minutes were lost to bad light in the morning. Carl Hopkinson was the only batsman to fail. He pushed to point and set off for the single but was beaten by Samit Patel's direct hit. The best batting came from their most consistent player this season, Murray Goodwin. But Richard Montgomerie (82) and Michael Yardy (119) had already established the foundations of a considerable score. Yardy was dropped at slip by Stephen Fleming on 38, just after lunch. Fleming left the field and did not return. He had four stitches inserted in the little finger of his left hand but intends to bat. Montgomerie, flicking the ball off his legs to the short Fox Road boundary, hit 16 fours before he edged a drive off Andrew Harris and was caught at slip. Yardy played and missed but was generally at his ugly duckling best, shovelling the ball through midwicket and extra-cover to reach the ninth century of his career. Sussex were at their most dominant during the fourth-wicket stand of 122 between Goodwin and Chris Adams. In three successive deliveries from Harris, bowling to an off-side field, Adams flicked him over square-leg for six and pulled and on-drove him for fours. Adams hit 72 from 91 balls and looked capable of a major score but flicked Charlie Shreck to midwicket. Goodwin was out in the last over of the day, bowled by Shreck for 99. But it did not spoil a very good day for Sussex."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
