The budget for the government\u2019s conservation watchdog has been slashed in half over five years, leaving it \u201cmassively depleted\u201d, according to Juniper, the influential former Friends of the Earth campaigner whom the environment secretary, Michael Gove, appointed earlier this year. Sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs) cannot be monitored to ensure their wildlife riches are maintained, and on national nature reserves Natural England can only afford to ensure basic health and safety for visitors, he said. \u201cI\u2019ve inherited an organisation that is depleted, massively depleted,\u201d Juniper told the Guardian in his first national newspaper interview since taking the job. \u201cOn a whole range of subjects, we cannot do what society expects of us. \u201cFor example, all we\u2019re able to spend on the management of the national nature reserve estate is for health and safety so visitors don\u2019t hurt themselves. \u201cWe\u2019ve got no monitoring capacity on the SSSIs. Our ability to give advice to planning applications and our works on landscapes, national parks and areas of outstanding natural beauty is cut now to pretty much nothing.\u201d Juniper, visiting Halvergate Marshes in Norfolk, an SSSI and the second largest block of freshwater marshland in Britain, said he had been given no guarantees over budget increases or even an end to cuts so Natural England can revive wildlife and use natural landscapes to help tackle the climate emergency. But he said he had taken the job because he wanted to \u201creinvigorate the official nature conservation effort in this country\u201d. Juniper said budget cuts left the watchdog vulnerable to legal challenges. The WildJustice group led by Mark Avery, Ruth Tingay and Chris Packham successfully forced Natural England to scrap the \u201cgeneral licence\u201d that previously allowed landowners to freely kill certain bird species such as crows and woodpigeons. WildJustice has launched a fresh legal challenge against new temporary general licences, and Juniper invited Avery, Packham and Tingay to meet him. \u201cThey are good friends of mine and I\u2019d be pleased to talk to them about this or anything else, but the involvement of lawyers makes that more difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cI would hope that conservationists could be working together to try to solve these problems in a less time-consuming and confrontational manner because these legal actions do use up a vast amount of resources.\u201d Juniper appeared to accept that Gove was unlikely to remain environment secretary much longer. He said: \u201cMichael Gove has been an incredibly energetic, dedicated and effective secretary of state for the environment and it\u2019s very rare we get those. The last one who made that kind of impact was John Gummer back in the early 90s. As was the case with John Gummer we were very surprised how the brief became so passionately owned \u2013 Michael Gove has done that and the conservation community has a lot to thank him for, for putting these issues back on the map.\u201d Juniper said he hoped Gove\u2019s successor would take heed of the public mood, as outlined by recent Extinction Rebellion protests and the school climate strikes. He said: \u201cI would hope no matter what the personal views of the new secretary of state they will come to the role recognising that the voters these days really want delivery on this stuff.\u201d A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: \u201cNatural England\u2019s work is vital for protecting and enhancing the nation\u2019s natural environment. We have worked closely with Natural England to settle their budget for the coming year.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
