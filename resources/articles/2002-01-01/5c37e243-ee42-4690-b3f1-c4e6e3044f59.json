Why all this sanctimonious shock-horror? Sorry and all that, but personally I can't wait for Tyson v Lewis on April 6. Enough is enough, demanded the self-righteous pharisees of the ringside after Mike Tyson's bear-garden hurly-burly in New York last week. But rest assured that, to a man, those hollow double-dealers will be in the front row, licking their lips, come April. If the contest takes place, that is; which it should. The sport of professional prizefighting has for so long been discredited that these sudden fits of piety in the public prints can only draw a smile. Boxing has wrung its gnarled old hands and uttered those weary \"last chance saloon\" mea culpas so often down the century since Lord Queensberry came up with his wheeze for legitimacy that it would represent an apocalyptic turn-up if they cancelled a promotion on the grounds of a boxer's bad behaviour. Especially one for which there were unbelievable mountains of money to be made. Oodles of boodle means the show will go on. For there is no business like boodle business. Certainly not in Nevada. Most certainly not in Las Vegas. If Tyson was not going to be banned for life by Nevada or by boxing itself after he had bitten off and spat out Evander Holyfield's ear, then we can take it he won't be banned for over-the-top ticket-selling at a press conference. From this distance anyway, I fancy it would be a seismic shock if, at its meeting tomorrow, the five-man committee of the Nevada State Athletic Commission did not renew Tyson's boxing licence and no more than yellow-card him, naughty boy, for inspiring the riotous shambles in New York last week. Because, business being business, does not Tyson v Lewis whistle a tunefully merry jackpot of $400m that, apparently, will reinvigorate Nevada's hotbed of hedonistic holidays, hard hit since September 11? No problem there, then; duty will be duly done to a depressed economy and I guarantee ear-muncher Mike will be welcomed back to the sagging Strip with open arms. By the by, the best of the headlines after last week's imbroglio was USA Today's on Tyson - Still Crazy After All These Ears - and the daftest bit of psychobabble was the Daily Telegraph's clearing its decks for a sermon from Dr Rosemary Leonard, billed as \"resident medical adviser to BBC Breakfast News\", who came to the scholarly and conclusive diagnosis that \"any man who is even considering taking on Tyson in the ring should have his head examined\". Wow, thanks, doc. Truly brill! Tomorrow's far more pressing worry for the Vegas burghers, as well as their crazy, mixed-up meal-ticket Mr T, will concern the mood of their neighbours in the Clark County district attorney's office as they ponder on having sufficient evidence to charge the already twice-jailed and two-time heavyweight champion with sexual assault against a lap dancer. If that happened, the moralists would doubtless demand putting the tin lid on any boxing match there and then, and would be happy to let the \"innocent till proved guilty\" precept be violated. It would, as well, close the lid irrevocably on the life and times, the incredible rise and horrendous fall, of Mike Tyson. It is difficult to believe that it is all of 18 years since I first laid eyes on him. At the Los Angeles Olympics of 1984 his manager, the venerable Cus D'Amato, called a press conference where the handful of us who bothered to turn up were invited to squeeze the biceps of his 18-year-old protege and utter an astonished \"gosh\". It was long before the tattooist had needled the tributes to Tyson's wife Monica, Arthur Ashe and Mao Zedong on those mountainous bulges at the top of his arms. The young man was a manipulated spectre at those Olympics for, although he had spectacularly won the Golden Gloves championship, he had been surprisingly beaten in the Olympic trials by Henry Tillman, who, with Cuba, East Germany and the Soviet Union boycotting the games, won the heavyweight gold medal. D'Amato paraded the teenaged Tyson around the tournament to show us, and America, what we were missing. The young man with the lisp was full of himself to the point of mania. Already he could not handle press conferences. Two days later the office in London rang me to follow up a paragraph that had come over the wires - a young boxer frustrated at not having made the US team had tried to gatecrash the athletes' village and, when apprehended, had emptied a can of beer over security guards and told them: \"Go fuck yourselves, white boys.\" It was Tyson. No charges were brought. Which, we were to learn soon enough, was unusual. For more than half a dozen years previously the boy from the notorious Bedford-Stuyvesant district of Brooklyn had proclaimed himself at one juvenile hearing \"the best and fastest pickpocket in New York\". By his 12th birthday he was carrying a gun and holding up shopkeepers. Before he was 13 he was in the Spofford detention centre in the Bronx after the young offenders' court had been told he had been arrested 44 times. He escaped from Spofford, beat up and robbed an old man in a lift and was incarcerated in the Tyron corrective centre 200 miles away in upstate Johnstown . . . Where he began to box . . . was legally adopted by D'Amato at 15 . . . and within five years was the youngest world heavyweight champion in history as well as, for five further years, possibly the most talentedly destructive heavyweight ever seen. In hoping for Tyson to be given another last chance and relishing the idea of a showdown at last with Lewis, I am being serious and not talking solely as a one-eyed sports nut who wants to see the Best v the Best settle the argument. Nor do I care if Las Vegas, that mountain-rimmed desert Gomorrah, had all its winking neon switched off at a stroke of collective bankruptcy. I want desperately for no evidence of assault against Tyson to be found, for him to fight - and to win, which I am confident he would - and to be able to retire, forever in peace . . . be able to beat a noble retreat and make all those sanctimonious, self-righteous ringside hangers-on and their synchronised hypocrisy have to gulp on their words for the rest of their days. After spending three years in an Indiana prison for raping a teenage beauty queen, Desiree Washington, Tyson returned to the ring in 1995. They sent me to cover his comeback bout, which was a one-round travesty against Peter McNeeley. Tyson had maintained grand estates in Maryland, Ohio and Connecticut, but this time his \"friends from England\" were invited to visit his mansion in the Nevada desert, particularly to inspect the British autos of which he was so proud - and in the hangar-like garages, among other vehicles, were a gleaming Rolls-Royce Silver Spur, a Rolls-Royce Corniche, a top-of-the-range Bentley, a luxury Range Rover, a vintage Jaguar E-type, a Porsche, a Lamborghini, an Aston-Martin Lagonda, and a $210,000 400bhp black Ferrari Testarossa. He also kept pet lions, tigers and pumas on gold chains. The mansion's hallway sported a chandelier worthy of Versailles and the estate was surrounded by life-size marble statues of Tyson's heroes: Genghis Khan, Mao, Alexander the Great, Hannibal.\"I really dig Hannibal,\" Mike told us. \"Hannibal had real guts. He rode elephants into Cartilage.\" This week, starting tomorrow, Tyson himself is riding into cartilage all right."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
