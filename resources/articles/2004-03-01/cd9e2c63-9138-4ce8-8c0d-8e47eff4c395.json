Last weekend's semi-finals attracted an aggregate crowd of less than 12,000 and with no possibility of moving the final to a northern venue closer to the modest supporter base of the two finalists, BBC Sport this week took the unusual step of circulating its regional offices to urge them to drum up some interest. \"The Rugby Football Union and BBC Sport are understandably concerned that Twickenham might not be jam-packed for the game,\" read the memo, pointing out that \"plenty of tickets\" would be available to run as competitions. Meanwhile, the government may currently be at odds with the BBC but that has not stopped the sports minister Richard Caborn choosing one of their top editors to be his public face. John Evans, the editor of Westminster Hour on Radio 4, has been selected as press officer to replace Phil Townsend, who recently took over as the communications director of Manchester United."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
