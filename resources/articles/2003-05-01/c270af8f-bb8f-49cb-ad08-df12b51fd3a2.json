This, at any rate, is the starting point of Adam Nicolson's splendid account of how the AV was created. He is so approving that only a deeply committed Christian, one might think, could possibly have written it, but not so, apparently. \"I am no atheist\", he writes, \"but I am no churchgoer\"; which puts him almost alongside the unbelieving Robin Lane Fox, whose The Unauthorised Version has for many years been the model for scrupulously disinterested and scholarly critiques of the subject. As Nicolson points out, James I has generally been best remembered for his defects and shortcomings, including (for heaven's sake) the fact that his tongue was much too large for his mouth. So he was an unlikely hero of this epic literary project - \"the greatest creation of the 17th century\" - especially given that he spent half his life in the hunting field. But it was he who conjured the result from contending views of what a new translation should aim for, he who sanctioned the translators, he who paid each of them 30 shillings a week (which was not penny-pinching), he who encouraged the AV's fine balance between literature and revelation. He was a monarch who had endured years of dogfighting with Scottish Presbyterians, and was therefore attracted to the Church of England because it accepted the king as its head. He once said \"I am for the medium in all things\", and he was a tremendous bibliophile, greatly obsessed with words. There or thereabouts was the crux of his inspiration. It was originally intended that there should be 54 translators from the original Hebrew and Greek - four times as many as any other Bible had employed - but 50 was the final muster, nominated by Richard Bancroft, soon to be elevated from the see of London to Canterbury, and to give England its first public library, in Lambeth Palace. He had at first disputed the need for a new translation (he was happy enough with the Bishops' Bible of 1568), but he knew which side his bread was buttered on and so became an eager henchman of the king. And an intriguingly disparate collection of divines and academics his choices turned out to be. Lancelot Andrewes, the lachrymose Dean of Westminster and author of a great devotional classic Preces Privatae, was another political operator, who could speak 15 modern languages and half a dozen ancient tongues. William Bedwell, a minor clergyman, was also a leading mathematician and one of England's first Arabists, who was \"captivated by the theological, medical and mathematical genius of the Arabs\". John Layfield, a Greek scholar from Trinity College, Cambridge, had been chaplain to an expedition to Puerto Rico and was enchanted by its exotic landscape and its natives, his narrative of the journey notably lacking in either cynicism or prejudice. George Abbott, also bound in due course for Canterbury, had preached a different sermon on the Book of Jonah every Thursday from 1594 to 1599 - 260 addresses on that single topic alone - while composing a bestselling history of the world and gradually stumbling his way towards a theory of natural selection more than two centuries before Charles Darwin perfected it. His antithesis was perhaps Miles Smith, Bishop of Gloucester, who once walked out in the middle of a particularly boring sermon in Chipping Camden and took himself off to the tavern next door. Then there was Sir Henry Savile, scholar, courtier, politician, mathematician and astronomer, a famous gardener and the greatest living authority on St John Chrysostom. He was also lecturer in Greek at Oxford, where he founded the first chairs in geometry and astronomy. There was John Overall, Dean of St Paul's, sometime Regius Professor of Divinity at Cambridge, hostile to Puritans, a middle-aged bachelor when he fell heavily in love at last, married and was then cuckolded by Anne Orwell, who eloped with a Yorkshire squire. And there was Richard Thomson, fellow of Clare, Cambridge, who hob-nobbed with the fast set in London (where he rarely went to bed sober) and was notorious for his witty translations of Martial's most obscene epigrams. Their colleagues offered similar variety, between them exhibiting every shade of churchmanship, though the majority were distinctly anti-Catholic, and two of them (including Abbott) had made a final attempt to convert the head of the English Jesuits to Protestantism just before he was executed for being implicated (without any foundation at all) in the Gunpowder Plot. Most conspicuously, however, this was to be the all-rounders' Bible, given its vitality by men of many parts. The destruction of much documentary evidence over the years means we have no complete record of how this enterprise was conducted from start to finish. What we do know is that the translators were divided into half a dozen sub-committees under different directors (of whom Andrewes was one) in Westminster, Oxford and Cambridge. Each man was given a particular portion of the Bible to translate in his own time. Andrewes himself took charge of the Old Testament, though the opening chapters of Genesis were Layfield's work, the luscious description of Eden almost certainly deriving from his love affair with the Caribbean. The chapter summaries and the preface were Miles Smith's contribution, while the Cambridge divines were responsible for the Apocrypha, and so on. Once a week the various groups met to compare notes and discuss each other's work, the directors adjudicating before everyone was sent home to proceed or to try again. This process took six years before a final consideration of the work took place at Stationers' Hall in London, where the go-ahead to print was given. Twelve months later, in 1611, King James had his new Bible at last, living proof that committees do sometimes work magnificently. It was not a flawless piece of work, the Pauline Epistles being particularly troublesome, with potential confusion hidden in endless subordinate clauses. Nor was it wholly original, some parts of it being lifted wholesale from William Tyndale's Bible and many phrases transposed from the Catholic Douai Bible. But what is uniquely brilliant about the Authorised Version is its feeling for the cadences and rhythms of the language, its soaring flights of imagination and \"its air of irreproachable authority, which is the essence of sacred ritual\". Nothing remotely comparable has appeared since, though there have been many dismal failures, such as the New English Bible of 1962-70, which TS Eliot quite properly dismissed as a \"combination of the vulgar, the trivial and the pedantic\". Or, as Nicolson has it, a work using \"the language of the memo\". His own contribution is not flawless either. It is so good a book that it's a shame he hasn't thought to give the sources of his many quotations except in the vaguest terms; and he doesn't even mention Richard Hooker, dead only four years before the translators were appointed, whose Of the Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity gave the Church of England its most distinctive caste marks quite as much as the Authorised Version and the Book of Common Prayer. But this is sniping, when Nicolson really deserves at least an 18-gun salute. Power and Glory is a fine piece of history, ecclesiology and literature all rolled into one and, what's more, like the Authorised Version itself, it sings. \u00b7 Geoffrey Moorhouse's The Pilgrimage of Grace is published by Weidenfeld"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
