You can hear bands being freed from the shackles of Motown covers, then realising they don't actually have anything meaningful to say, but not letting it stop them \u2013 the Hi-Fis' incredible, stomping fever dream of a song, Tread Softly for the Sleepers, turns out to be about asking people to walk upstairs quietly because the singer's fed up of being woken up. Completists will be gratified by previously unissued demo versions of B-sides (Tintern Abbey's Busy Bee), but there's great stuff here for casual listeners: the Open Mind's Magic Potion suggests they could have been the British Stooges. The sleevenotes are a boon, too, with a pleasing dryness: \"The Sorrows relocated to the continent when the hits (or, in their case, the hit) dried up at home.\" Bags of fun, and a reminder that the Beatles and Pink Floyd \u2013 rarely audible influences here \u2013 weren't the be-all and end-all of UK psych."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
