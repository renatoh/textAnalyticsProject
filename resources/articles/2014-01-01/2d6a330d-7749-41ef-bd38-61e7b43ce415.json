The anticipation was that the Sydney Test might decide the destination of the Ashes. Instead, it is a celebration march for the Australians and, at best, the start of a new era for England. The question \"Do you think you will play three debutants, Alastair?\" would have been met with utter consternation six weeks ago, with those dark eyebrows heading heavenwards. Now the response from Cook was: \"Yes, we could do. Certainly there will be some changes.\" This after looking at a pitch that was remarkably green 48 hours before the toss. Both Cook and Andy Flower have embraced the notion of a \"new era\" in the last fortnight. They have not had much choice. \"If you go back eight or nine months, the England team picked itself and everyone was very solid in terms of results,\" said Cook. \"What's happened over the last few months is that we know we can't now rely on the 11 or 12 guys we picked constantly. But that gives opportunities to different faces and it's quite exciting to see whether those players can grab their chance.\" Who are those players? Gary Ballance is highly likely to play, probably instead of Michael Carberry in a revamped order; Boyd Rankin could replace Tim Bresnan. Both these players have traipsed around Australia awaiting their chance. The third potential debutant has a different story. Scott Borthwick of Durham, who is set to replace Monty Panesar, who has a calf injury, was part of the development squad and he has also been playing grade cricket for Northern Districts in Sydney. He turned out once with Brad Haddin \u2013 \"he seemed like a good fellow\". Borthwick, 23, a leg-spinning all-rounder, was about to head for home when he got the call from Andy Flower \u2013 \"I didn't think of it when Graeme Swann retired\". Although he batted at three last summer in Durham's triumphant championship campaign he still regards himself as \"a leg-spinner who bats\". His inspiration as a youngster was Shane Warne. He still can't quite believe what's happened to him. So here is one piece of advice: when he is thrown into the Sydney Test as a multi-dimensional alternative to Panesar, he should not expect that nice Mr Haddin to be quite so friendly from behind the stumps. Three debutants would be extraordinary. There has been a call from the headline seekers for dramatic change and for them the more prominent the heads the better. In fact, we are witnessing significant changes to the team and both Cook and Flower are giving the impression that they are excited by that challenge. Cook made it clear yet again how much faith he has in Flower. \"He's a very good coach. I think this is our first series loss for a while and I know the defeat has happened in a bad way here but we have done a lot of very good stuff. \"We are certainly evolving as a side and a lot of players are coming in now, which is exciting, but we do need strong leadership at this time. Andy is a strong man and a good leader.\" Cook is also eager to continue amid some criticisms that he is \"too nice\" to be captain, that he is the \"perfect son-in-law\" (although not available). Can he wield the hairdryer? \"There are times when you need to use it and there are times when you need to be sympathetic too. That balance is the answer to being a good leader. I hope I can be firm enough with the troops when I need to be. Yes, I can get cross but it's not my style to go ranting and raving.\" He understands that he will get flak when the side loses. \"Michael Clarke was getting a lot of stick when Australia were losing 4-0 in India, with people saying he wasn't a good captain, but suddenly he's winning games of cricket and he's the world's best captain. So that's the world we live in and we appreciate that.\" He also understands the need to refresh his team by changing the routine. One or two onlookers were aghast (and maybe seeking another headline) when England chose not to use the nets in Sydney two days before the Test. \"We had about an hour and 10 minutes of fielding,\" explained Cook. \"It was fitness based and hard work. We've done a hell of a lot of batting on this tour.\" Unfortunately, most of it has been in the nets rather than in the middle."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
