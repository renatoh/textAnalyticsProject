Being meek and from the West Country, suddenly living in a house-share in London with 15 other students was a shock. Our house was the most unhygienic property I have ever been in. For some reason, we were obsessed with filling the house with \"objets de street art\". I remember coming down one day and finding a whole bus shelter (later joined by a bus stop). I was a bit geeky and hadn't caught on to not washing or ironing clothes. I would press my slacks before lectures. But we had a real rat problem, and the landlord brought in Rentokil. I will never forget going to pull out my iron from the kitchen cupboard and realising a rat had rotted over the iron cord. It put me off ironing for a long, long time. I really enjoyed my course, but for me the really great thing about uni was learning to be in London, how to be an adult, to cook, to go out socialising - and I also discovered my sexuality. Top tip My sister gave me a Student Emergency Kit - full of things like vitamins and a \u00a320 note in an envelope that said \"Do not open except in emergency\" - and it really did save my life on a number of occasions. And don't eat the maggots in the tequila bottle. No matter how funny it seems. \u00b7 Kristian's new series, Double Agents, will be shown on the BBC in August Jody Furlong, presenter of BBC3's Find me the Face University of East London Media studies (1992-95) Degree 2:2 To be honest, university wasn't my highest priority. But when I was doing my A-levels, I had a panic when I realised that the alternative was to get a job. I moved from Maidstone in Kent. From the minute I got to London, it was about clubbing and going out. My fondest memory from that whole period - this is so gay - is meeting Naomi Campbell in a nightclub. In the last semester, I realised that I was going to get a third and I was mortified. I knuckled down, and once I started going to lectures I started to really enjoy it. So my regret is that I didn't work harder. Top tip You'll never get some opportunities again because you'll be at work. So if you want to go out clubbing every night, go for it - but make sure you make the most of the people you meet. Judge Jules, Radio 1 DJ London School of Economics Law (1986-88) Degree: 2:1 I was from London and went to university there, so in my first year all my mates who hadn't gone on gap years were still around and that gave me a real advantage. I didn't feel the pressure to meet people straight away. I did get very involved in running the clubbing side of the student union. I was very keen on the DJ side of things, not least because it got me free records. The most significant thing was moving away from home. In my case it was very emotional because my mother died a month after I went to university - I had just left home for the first time. I never actually practised law, but some aspects of my degree have proven invaluable in running a small business. But I was putting on illegal raves throughout university. Top tip Involve yourself and explore - pucker up your chest, get out there and enjoy your new home. \u00b7 Judge Jules's show is on Radio 1, Saturday mornings 1-3am Ed Smith, captain of Middlesex Cricket Club Peterhouse, Cambridge (1995-98) History Degree: Double 1st The first few days everyone is feeling their way around each other, and everyone's behaviour is pretty embarrassing. The university is very keen that people don't slip through the net and become lonely, so every minute is accounted for, but the idea that they would provide a structure for us to get to know each other really didn't appeal. And sportsmen spend so much of their time in enforced sociability that I didn't need more of it. I was lucky because I was at a small college and there just weren't enough sportsmen to create a clique. I ended up with friends from all over the place. I'm still in touch with my closest friends from Peterhouse, Rob Ashforth and Jonathan Shapiro. In the first year, the three of us lived in a late regency terrace, St Peter's Terrace - I had a bedroom on the top floor and a sitting room downstairs, and I installed a phone, which in those days was very exotic. I enjoyed Cambridge life and the people who taught me history - notably Tim Blanning, Brendan Simms and John Adamson. John was a great don to know because his gift was to make academic life unintimidating and encourage irreverence. Top tip Knowing too many people is far more problematic than too few, so bide your time. And be yourself, because it will be one of the few times when you really can be. \u00b7 Ed Smith's latest book, What Sport Tells Us About Life: Bradman's Average, Zidane's Kiss and Other Sporting Lessons is published by Viking Tamsin Greig, actor Birmingham University (1985-89) Drama and theatre arts Degree: 1st I wasn't a great adventurer to be honest. I was quite fearful of going away from home - we were quite a connected family and I spent the first week or so very puffy-eyed. I lived in an all-girls' hall because I had been at an all-girls school and the idea of being near boys filled me with terror. It was very nice, everyone ate together and watched EastEnders and Blackadder - and it meant that I didn't have to look at any boys. I did actually have a long-term boyfriend, but I still didn't know how to actually talk to boys. There were so many clubs and societies you could join. It was a bit like being in a candy shop - I did trampolining for a bit. The course at Birmingham was, and is, great - it's the most practical academic course you can do, so we did lighting, stage management and a lot of performance in the second and third year. Although I found freshers' week difficult, it has stood me in good stead because it is exactly like any first week on set. Top tip Smile. Make eye-contact. And always be the first one to offer to buy someone a drink. \u00b7 Tamsin Greig will appear in a monologue, Always the Teacher Never the Bride on Teachers' TV, August 19 at 8pm Josie Long, comedian Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford (2000-03) English language and literature: \"I don't want to say what I got in my degree - I disappointed myself - but I got a first in my dissertation!\" My college was in a really beautiful Victorian building, but I drew the short straw. Some people had amazingly beautiful rooms looking out on to a sunken garden, with an ensuite - but I was in an attic with paper-thin walls and a sink in the cupboard. I found it hard to get up in the morning, hard not to put on weight from drinking, hard not to leave things to the last minute. There were lots of things that were really good about being at Oxford. I lived next to a park and the river. The libraries were amazing - you could order up these 17th-century popular magazines and they would just turn up in a box for you. And all the people were really ambitious and driven, but not in a gross way - so it was really inspiring. Top tip Ask for help if you need it - don't be scared of seeming stupid. \u00b7 Josie Long will be appearing at the Edinburgh Festival, The Pleasance, until August 25 Alfonso Sharland, band member of The Hoosiers London Met University (2001-04) Mass communication and creative writing Degree: 2:1 I knew Irwin [Sparkes, fellow member of The Hoosiers] from home, and that made it easier, but everyone was really friendly, and being in halls helps because you can all go and watch Neighbours together. We soon had a big gang. I wasn't too bad at budgeting. I got a big loan, which is now weighing round my neck, but I always worked as well. I made lots of friends and I'm still in touch with quite a few - and now there's Facebook, they all come back to get you. Top tip Mashed potato with tuna and Dolmio sauce. Lucy Porter, comedian Manchester University (1991-94) English language and literature Degree: 2:1 I picked Manchester because I liked the Stone Roses (I also liked the Wonderstuff, but I'm pleased I didn't go to Wolverhampton). I thought it would be a fun place, and it was. But in the first week it rained so heavily, I thought I'd made a terrible mistake and had a bit of a cry. I hung out with a lot of people from my course, and because I was an indie kid, that's who I gravitated towards. We found all the indie hangouts and I also got into the Manchester comedy scene, going to see Steve Coogan and Caroline Ahern. I also acquired my taste for strong liquor. One of the first nights, I drank more Bailey's than a human being should ever consume, though really no one should drink more than one glass. Top tip Don't be petty about people using your milk and never write notes and put them in the fridge. \u00b7Lucy Porter will be appearing at the Edinburgh Festival, Pleasance Courtyard, until August 25 Brendan Mackey, actor whose credits include BBC's Life On Mars, Casualty and the film Touching The Void Open University BA (Hons) literature Degree: ongoing I always fancied doing an academic degree, but couldn't see how I'd fit a course around my job. The great thing about the Open University (OU) is that it's so flexible. It's about 15 hours' study a week. When I'm away on location, I just take the work with me, sit in my caravan or hotel room and get on with it. This year, I'll be writing a piece of coursework in Bangkok and sitting my final exam in LA. I trained as an actor at Rada, but it was a very practical course. After more than 10 years away from studying, it took a while to get back into it, but I've really enjoyed it. On my current grades, I'm heading for a first, but I'll be happy if I get a 2:1. I can now talk about things I could never have talked about before. Top tip If you have a passion for the subject, you can weather the tough times. \u00b7 Brendan Mackey stars in the horror film Paintball, to be released in 2009.
