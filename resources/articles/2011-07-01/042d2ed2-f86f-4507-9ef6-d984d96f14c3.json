Equally surprising was the fact that there were other people already there, talking and so on. Man 1 \"I was there, watching Pixie Lott in the rain, and I just thought, 'I've had enough'. Am I too old for this shit? Shivering in a tent.\" Woman \"Ha!\" Man 1 \"But it was good, you know? A really good festival, very well run. How's things going with you?\" Woman \"OK.\" Man 1 (like he knew she had a secret) \"I hear you've got a new settee.\" Woman (with a jokey confessional face) \"On Saturday, I just stayed in.\" Man 1 (sincerely) \"Awesome!\" Man 2 (sitting down beside them, laden with snacks) \"How are you, then?\" Man 1 \"Bit buggy, went to a festival, got wet. Now got consumption or something!\" Man 2 \"Which festival?\" Man 1 (genuinely struggling with his recent past) \"Isle of \u2026 is it, Isle of Wight?\" Man 2 \"Yeah. Isle of Wight. How was that? \" Man 1 \"It was very well run.\" Man 2 \"Yeah, that's what I hear, but, I mean, who was playing? Who was good?\" Man 1 \"Joan Jett, who for me was the highlight.\" Man 2 \"That's my era!\" Man 1 \"You been anywhere?\" Man 2 (clenching and raising his fist) \"Yeah, on holiday to Greece \u2026 White Riot!\" And with that light-hearted revolutionary gesture, the adverts began."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
