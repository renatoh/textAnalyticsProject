Please don\u2019t misunderstand me \u2013 I\u2019m not saying don\u2019t be angry. Watching the videos of people stuck in the tower as it burned, seeing the posters with pictures of lost children, knowing that this tragedy happened in the middle of one of the wealthiest places on earth \u2013 this is a truly sickening tragedy that warrants our collective ongoing fury. However, the question is what we do with it. Channelled into effective resistance, this anger could drive the residents in North Kensington to hold those responsible to account, to recreate their community and rebuild their lives. It could see the rest of us make Grenfell a turning point, after which we no longer accept that people in different income brackets have different rights to a home safe from fire. By turning that anger into action, we can create a national movement to say \u201cnever again\u201d. Rage, on the other hand, is a passing howl resulting in some broken windows and placards left in the street. The problem with the \u201cday of rage\u201d protest that took place last week was not just that it was ineffective, though it was. (Unsurprisingly, several hundred protesters did not bring the government down.) The more serious fault is that it risks repeating some of the same dynamics that got us here in the first place \u2013 the voices of residents that were not listened to for years are now being ignored again. The Lancaster West residents association, which covers the estate around the Grenfell Tower, has been a member of Citizens UK for two-and-a-half years. The residents we\u2019re working with are more concerned with the fundamentals than rage. They want accurate information about those who lost their lives; they want to know that the air is safe to breathe and the building isn\u2019t going to collapse; and they need hot water, since the boiler that serves the whole estate was destroyed. The people embedded in local communities tend not to be the voices we\u2019ve heard on TV over this past week. That could be because of class bias, or that journalists gravitate towards those who are most controversial; or, more simply, that such people are too busy supporting their neighbours to be spokespeople. Bigger change must come but now, of all times, let\u2019s listen to them. Understanding the different causes is essential to finding the right responses. The \u201cday of rage\u201d event page says: \u201cWe will not settle for less than the destruction of May\u2019s coalition of austerity\u201d. And the organisers of that protest are not the only ones pointing the finger at austerity. Had it not been for Tory cuts, so the argument goes, the tower would not have burned, and no lives would have been lost. Without doubt, austerity has had a terrible impact on many vulnerable people \u2013 two examples being the bedroom tax and the scandalous cuts to local authorities who are having to cope with spiralling social care costs. But in this case, the local authority has nearly \u00a3274m in reserves, spent \u00a35m on Opera Holland Park, and had a housing department that ran a \u00a315m surplus. This points to a gross misallocation of funds, not an absence. The problem was that the residents were not listened to. When it came to allocating budgets and demanding attention, the opera lobby sang louder than the residents of Grenfell. The other narrative out there is that the problem lies solely with the leadership of Kensington and Chelsea. It\u2019s right that there have been resignations in the borough, and there should be more. But if it\u2019s solely the fault of certain politicians and officers, then why are councils of all stripes now rushing to take down combustible cladding? This is a story of powerlessness and negligence up and down the country. By laying responsibility entirely at national or local government, we write the residents out of the story once again. Their voice, their agency, their power. Why weren\u2019t they listened to when they complained about inadequate fire escapes and electrical surges, before this tragedy took place? And there are residents in hundreds of towers, in that same situation, whose complaints and requests have long been ignored. The underlying truth is that there is a gross inequality in the distribution of power in our society, as Grenfell demonstrates with painful clarity. We may have one person, one vote, but people\u2019s ability to get local and national government to respond depends on their access to power. So the answer cannot just be a new set of regulations and more funding, though we do need those too. People need to be equipped with the tools to demand not just that they are listened to, but that their interests are met. This means taking political action beyond the ballot box and the one-off protest. It means strengthening the tenants\u2019 groups, the churches, schools, voluntary sector and campaign bodies, so that people and their local associations can both stand up to the market when it tends towards exploitation and to the state when it is guilty of bureaucratic negligence. The situation at somewhere such as Grenfell shifts rapidly from day to day, and for all the goodwill in the world, it\u2019s impossible to know what\u2019s needed and what\u2019s not without being close to the ground. One surprising recent need was for volunteer accountants to help process the substantial funds that had been donated. With partners, we are now working to try to build the capacity of the residents\u2019 association so it can articulate and secure what is required. When the immediate needs of accommodation, hot water and some space to grieve and rest are met, that community can turn the conversation to how it will shape its own future and realise the justice it is owed. For the rest of us, there is a moment of urgency right now. There are 600 tower blocks being tested to determine whether their cladding, like Grenfell\u2019s, is combustible. That\u2019s a sentence I can\u2019t quite believe I am writing. Tens of thousands of people went to bed last night scared. St Mary\u2019s church, close to the Chalcots estate in Camden, had members of its congregation evacuated this weekend. And we know from other Citizens UK members across the country that there is appetite for a \u201cGrenfell \u2013 never again\u201d campaign. So if you\u2019re angry, join a local group \u2013 and if there isn\u2019t one, start one. Map out where the towers are in your area and reach out to residents\u2019 associations, remembering to listen first to what they want. Let\u2019s protest, but make it specific. First, persuade all councils to follow the example of Croydon and Birmingham and commit to installing sprinkler systems in their towers. Beyond that, it\u2019s about how we address powerlessness and equip citizens with the tools to organise. It shouldn\u2019t take a disaster to get their voices heard."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
