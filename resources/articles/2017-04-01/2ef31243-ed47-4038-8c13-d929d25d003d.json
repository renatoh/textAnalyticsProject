The company announced the long-anticipated move on Thursday, and according to Business Insider reported is looking for warehouse space in Brisbane, Sydney or Melbourne to become its first 93,000 sq m Australian \u201cfulfilment centre\u201d. \u201cAmazon Web Services launched an Australian region in 2012, we launched a Kindle store on amazon.com.au in 2013 and we now have almost 1,000 employees in the country,\u201d the company said. \u201cThe next step is to bring a retail offering to Australia, and we are making those plans now.\u201d The proposed new warehouse will create several hundred new jobs. \u201cWe are excited to bring thousands of new jobs to Australia, millions of dollars in additional investment, and to empower small Australian businesses through Amazon Marketplace,\u201d Amazon said. \u201cWe are optimistic that by focusing on the things we believe customers value most \u2014 low prices, vast selection and fast delivery \u2014 over time we\u2019ll earn the business of Australian customers.\u201d It\u2019s expected that services that led to Amazon dominating the retail market in the US, UK and much of western Europe, such as one-hour delivery, will be introduced in Australia soon. Analysts at Morgan Stanley have dubbed Amazon the \u201ccountry killer\u201d, warning its retail clients: \u201cWhile Amazon might take time to build up momentum in this country, it hangs like the sword of Damocles over corporate Australia.\u201d The warning, published in the Australian, came before Thursday\u2019s announcement. Amazon now accounts for $1bn of Australia\u2019s $300bn annual retail sales, according to Morgan Stanley. Its launch, with an initial focus on electronics, is expected to eat into the profits of JB Hi-Fi and Harvey Norman, whose annual revenues in the 2015-16 financial year were $3.9bn and $1.8bn respectively. Amazon has already criticised a tax plan designed to help bricks-and-mortar retailers such as Harvey Norman, saying a plan to impose the good and services tax on online purchases was so poorly designed it would \u201ccreate an inherent disincentive\u201d for online retailers to comply. \u201cWhile compliant sellers and electronic distribution platforms will charge GST, non-compliant sellers and electronic distribution platforms will be able to ship parcels to Australia at prices that appear more attractive to the consumer, with low risk of detection,\u201d it said in a submission to the parliamentary committee hearing on the proposed tax legislation, which will be held on Friday. \u201cThis incentivises consumers to buy from less reputable overseas vendors, at increased risk.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
