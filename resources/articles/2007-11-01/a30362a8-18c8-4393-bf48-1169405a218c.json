The inquiry by the Healthcare Commission was begun at the request of the hospital in Cambridgeshire after seven of 20 transplant patients died between January and September; an eighth patient critically ill at the time the inquiry began died later. \"We cannot offer a clear explanation of the increased mortality,\" said the inquiry report. \"Further work would be necessary to see whether such an explanation is possible.\" But the team, led by Nigel Ellis, said surgery, suspended for the fortnight-long inquiry, could resume as long as its 12 recommendations are implemented. The only consistent factor in all the deaths was a rise in time to transport hearts from one hospital to another, when they are without blood and start to deteriorate. The risk of a transplant death rises after 180 minutes, and \"exponentially\" after 240 minutes, the report says. In all deaths, this \"ischaemic\" time was more than 180 minutes. Papworth's clinical director for transplant services, Steven Tsui, said this was not unusual. \"The average ischaemic time of those who die is always greater than those who do not die. It is something we have been trying to reduce.\" There had been more than 1,000 heart transplants at Papworth. In that context, \"this is a relatively small number. It is difficult to explain why now and why this seven. It is a cluster, and I don't think anyone could explain why there is this cluster now.\" Ellis said: \"We did not find any evidence of inadequate care or evidence that the deaths could have been prevented. But the number of deaths since January has clearly been high. This is why we are asking the trust to put in place a number of important checks and safeguards. With these, the public can be reassured that everything possible is being done to protect heart transplant patients.\" Should any similar cluster occur there will be a full investigation. Papworth is asked to make procedures for preserving hearts \"in line with practice at other trusts\". Tsui, a transplant surgeon, said Papworth was not out of line - practice varied in the five English centres - but welcomed the recommendations. Heart transplants have changed, particularly due to seat-belt legislation which dramatically cut the number of young people dying in road accidents who were suitable donors. This was not a factor at Papworth, but Ellis and his team felt it was something to be addressed in future. \"Transplant centres ... have had to relax the criteria ... they are now using hearts which may not have previously been considered acceptable,\" said the report. Tsui said: \"This year we have only done 75 or so heart transplants - the lowest for 20 years. If you look at the US, for example, they have a population five times the size and do about 2,000 a year. We are doing about 100 or 120. We have a very severe shortage of donors.\" The need was not just to legislate so organs could be taken from anybody who had not explicitly refused beforehand, which is now the subject of a government review. \"Culturally, as a nation, we have to decide do we embrace transplantation and organ donation?\" said Tsui. \"It takes public education to make people realise this is important and life-saving.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
