Life expectancy figures from the past are skewed downwards due to high infant mortality. If 10 children die at age five while 10 people die at 70, the average life expectancy is 37.5. But for those who survive childhood it is 70. So, taking Bunting's example of 100 years ago, adult life expectancy then was probably not dissimilar to today's figures. For example, Gladstone was 88 when he died, and Disraeli 76. No doubt Bunting will gain this understanding as she gracefully ages. Dr Robert Pearce (age 63) Kingsbridge, Devon \u2022\u2008It is heartening to read that one's wisdom and brain do not decompose after 40 but may continue to develop for many years. On an earlier page I read that elective surgery is either being \"stopped, restricted or delayed\" (Report, 11 April). Having had two cataracts, two hernias and two bunions dealt with during the past 10 years, and also a hip replacement, I can only express gratitude to the NHS. As a result I lead a full and active life in my late 70s. What callow youth has decided all these procedures are \"elective\"? He, or she, has presumably never suffered real pain or misery \u2013 or maybe he is one of those cabinet millionaires. Marion Wallwork Nottingham \u2022\u2008I'd be feeling happier after reading Madeleine Bunting's column if it hadn't reminded me that most members of the government are far too young to be running the country.
