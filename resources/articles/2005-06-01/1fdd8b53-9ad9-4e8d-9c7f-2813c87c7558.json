Of course, some will argue against a label. To categorise \"black British\" film-making at a time when a white film-maker can make a film about the black community (Saul Dibb's Bullet Boy) and a black film-maker can make a film about the white community (Amma Asante's A Way of Life) is crass labelling, and should be avoided. As a rule, artists prefer to avoid boxes. But tell that to the financiers, distributors and cinema bookers who put their chequebooks back in their pockets as soon as they identify a film with mostly black characters and appealing to a mostly black audience. Others will argue that something cannot die which has never lived. After all, while someone of any background can recall at least one milestone of black cinematic history in the US, from Birth of a Nation to Shaft to She's Gotta Have It, one struggles to remember any pioneering works in Britain. Our stories remain untold. The most notable black British film in terms of public awareness and budget seems to have been Isaac Julien's Young Soul Rebels, which came out in 1991. Strong soundtrack, weak movie. It sank, and with it sank all the hopes of a black film industry in the UK. Some seven years later Babymother, the next black British film to make any impact, was a cliched pastiche of ghetto living. In failing at the box office they both gave truth to the lie that there was no market for black British cinema. It would be almost 10 more years before a black British film would get another chance. There are three main challenges for black British cinema. Funding is the most immediate. Movies are financed on sales estimates. There are certain territories where it is almost impossible to sell films with leading black characters. Dirty Pretty Things failed to get distribution in Germany and Japan simply because of its black male lead, Chiwetel Ejiofor. This is not racism. This is business, but it works like racism to disadvantage a minority community. A starving novelist can still create a masterpiece. Not so with the budget movie. Without funding, our directors and writers do not get the professional experience they need to establish themselves. The result is cynicism - I must write for a white audience in order to make money. That means either literally writing about white people or selling a stereotype of black people. There is a strong tradition of black cinema in the US and a dedicated audience. The challenge for black British film-making is to bring work of quality to the table that tells our own story in a way that is internationally marketable. This month sees the launch of Black World - a revolution on screen, established by the British Film Institute and the largest-ever national celebration of black film-making. Resurrection usually requires a miracle. But let's hope the BFI's festival can give black British cinema the kiss of life. \u00b7 Vanessa Walters is a playwright and novelist vanessawalters@hotmail.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
