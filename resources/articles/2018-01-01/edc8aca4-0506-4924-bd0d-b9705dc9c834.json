The comments by the shadow workplace relations minister signal the opposition is considering further changes to the Fair Work Act as part of a suite of measures already announced to boost collective bargaining. O\u2019Connor told Guardian Australia Labor was \u201cconcerned, in principle, with workers in a workplace being paid less just because they\u2019re employed by labour hire\u201d. \u201cIf you\u2019re doing like work in the same workplace and paid less, that is of great concern to us,\u201d he said, adding that it \u201cwon\u2019t be tolerated\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t want labour hire being used to undermine good faith bargaining,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. \u201cIt\u2019s hardly good faith bargaining if you strike an agreement and then bring workers in under different conditions. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s reasonable and fair.\u201d Labour law expert and University of Adelaide professor Andrew Stewart said the practice of striking a collective agreement with a small number of workers before a planned expansion or outsourcing to a labour hire company with a non-union agreement was \u201cbecoming one of the most effective methods of businesses to avoid collective bargaining\u201d. The Fair Work Commission can reject such agreements on the basis they have not been \u201cgenuinely agreed\u201d but many were upheld, he said. Labor has promised to: introduce a licensing regime for labour hire operators; raise the bar for termination of enterprise agreements; end all WorkChoices-era collective agreements, and crack down on \u201csham\u201d enterprise agreements struck with an unrepresentative sample of the workforce. In a speech in November, O\u2019Connor also said Labor would \u201clegislate to make clear that the workers who vote on an agreement must be representative of the workers who may ultimately be covered by [it]\u201d. But Stewart said Labor had so far stopped short of promising to legislate the principle of \u201cequal treatment\u201d, as many European countries had. \u201cThe idea would be to legislate that labour hire workers have to be treated equally to directly hired workers,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got employees who are entitled to the benefit of a collective agreement, the employer can\u2019t bring in labour hire workers and pay them any less than directly engaged workers.\u201d The Australian Council of Trade Unions has cited two examples of what it describes as a pattern of \u201cheavy-handed\u201d employer responses to industrial action. In January workers at Glencore\u2019s Oaky North site marked six months since they were locked out and management at Port Kembla locked out members of the Construction Forestry Mining Energy Union in January last year for about a week. O\u2019Connor said Labor was \u201clooking at a whole array of issues in bargaining, including workers\u2019 and employers\u2019 ability to take [protected industrial] action\u201d. The rights of both employers and employees were under examination, he said, before adding that Labor is \u201cconcerned when we see lockouts that go for six months\u201d. O\u2019Connor said Glencore\u2019s was a \u201cdisproportionate response to some industrial bans\u201d and Labor had made its displeasure clear to the company. \u201cWe want people to treat each other well,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not always the case that changing the law can fix things \u2013 we need trust, not just punitive laws.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
