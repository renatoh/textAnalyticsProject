This means that the top of the range 17-inch PB now motors along at 1.67Ghz and comes in at \u00a31,849. At the bottom end of the spread, the \u00a31,049 12-inch book now hits 1.5Ghz and they all come with 512Mb memory as standard. It's no surprise - these changes were actually expected to be announced by Steve Jobs last month - but those itching to upgrade from existing laptops may want to wait for the G5, rumoured to be arriving some time around the middle of the year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
