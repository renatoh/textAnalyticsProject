Boyega made the comments in a Radio Times interview where he discussed his future plans to create work about black life in Britain, partly as a result of having to explain to Americans that black Londoners exist while promoting his 2011 breakthrough film Attack the Block. He said: \u201cI\u2019m black British and I\u2019m from London. And that in itself is something that the world doesn\u2019t know about yet. I met American people \u2013 civilians of a first-world country \u2013 who were confused that there were black people in London. \u201cThat\u2019s why entertainment is so special, it\u2019s a great chance to bring people together and open them up to things they haven\u2019t seen before.\u201d Boyega, who became one of the world\u2019s most high-profile young actors after he was cast in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, said he started his own production company \u2013 UpperRoom Entertainment \u2013 in order to retain more creative control over his future projects and emulate the film\u2019s director, JJ Abrams, who cast him. Next year the actor will star in Steve McQueen\u2019s forthcoming BBC series Small Axe, which follows a group in London\u2019s African-Caribbean community from the late 1960s to the early 80s. Boyega will play Leroy Logan, one of the first black Met police officers. Boyega had to go through a seven-month audition process before he secured the part of Finn in Abrams\u2019 Star Wars trilogy. The third film, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, is out this month and earlier this year Boyega admitted to losing his script, which ended up on eBay, before being reclaimed by Disney."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
