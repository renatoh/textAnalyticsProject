And after a hugely successful launch in the US, it is open in the UK from today. Bookshop was dreamed up by the writer and co-founder of Literary Hub, Andy Hunter. It allows independent bookshops to create their own virtual shopfront on the site, with the stores receiving the full profit margin \u2013 30% of the cover price \u2013 from each sale. All customer service and shipping are handled by Bookshop and its distributor partners, with titles offered at a small discount and delivered within two to three days. \u201cIt\u2019s been a wild ride,\u201d said Hunter, who launched the site in the US in January. \u201cFive weeks into what we thought was going to be a six-month period of refining and improving and making small changes, Covid-19 hit and then suddenly we were doing massive business.\u201d Initially starting with 250 bookshops, more than 900 stores have now signed up in the US. \u201cWe went from selling $50,000 (\u00a338,000) worth of books in all of February, to selling $50,000 a day in March, then $150,000 a day in April,\u201d said Hunter. By June, Bookshop sold $1m worth of books in a day. The platform has now raised more than $7.5m (\u00a35.7m) for independent bookshops across the US. \u201cWe were four employees plus me, working at home, getting up as early as we could and going to bed as late as we could, trying to make it all work. It was a real white-knuckle ride,\u201d said Hunter. \u201cBut it was extremely gratifying because the whole time we were getting messages from stores saying, \u2018Thank God you came along, you\u2019ve paid our rent, you\u2019ve paid our health insurance this year.\u2019 If you\u2019re going to have to work in insane circumstances and with huge amounts of stress, it\u2019s good to be doing it in something you feel good about.\u201d Bookshop is a benefit corporation in the process of applying for B Corporation certification in the UK, created with the mission \u201cto benefit the public good by contributing to the welfare of the independent literary community\u201d. Rules state that it can never be sold to a major US retailer, including Amazon. Hunter believes the reason for Bookshop\u2019s quick success is readers\u2019 fondness for their local booksellers. \u201cBookstores have been in trouble for a while because of Amazon\u2019s growth, but this pandemic has really accelerated it. Amazon has gotten much more powerful, while there are 100-year-old stores that are hanging on for survival,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we were so successful because enough people were conscious of that, and wanted to rally around around their beloved bookstores, because they care about the world that we emerge from this pandemic into.\u201d Hunter had been planning to launch Bookshop in the UK in 2021 or 2022. But after seeing the success of the platform in the US, shops, publishers and authors in the UK asked him to step up the timeline. Bookshop.org launches in the UK on Monday, with more than 130 British bookshops already signed up and 200 expected by the end of the year. The UK arm of the company will be run by managing director Nicole Vanderbilt, the former international vice-president of Etsy. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get there before Christmas, and give people a way to support their stores and buy their gift books, then it\u2019s gonna be really catastrophic for shops, which is why we\u2019ve scrambled all hands on deck to get it up,\u201d said Hunter. Bookshops make no financial investment, with all customer service and shipping handled by Bookshop, and, in the UK, by distributor Gardners. The browsing experience is intended to \u201cmirror the joy of discovering a new book in a physical bookshop\u201d, says the company, with experts, rather than algorithms, doing the curating. Each independent that joins has its own \u201cstorefront\u201d page, where customers can browse virtual tables of recommended books. For example, a user can see what the owner of The Shetland Times Bookshop (\u201cBritain\u2019s most northerly general bookshop, situated over 60 degrees north and closer to Norway than to London\u201d) personally recommends, in lists such as \u201cwonderfully funny picture books I\u2019ve read to the bookshop staff\u201d, and \u201cbooks to help you take life in your stride\u201d. British booksellers and publishers have welcomed its arrival. \u201cBeing an independent bookseller has for so many years been such a David v Goliath battle that it feels slightly disconcerting when someone at last hands you a bazooka instead of you peppering away with your slingshot,\u201d said Andy Rossiter of Rossiter Books in Ross-on-Wye. Philip Gwyn Jones, publisher at Picador, described Bookshop as \u201ca positively revolutionary moment in the history of bookselling in the UK, and in the evolution of the relationship between writers and readers\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for us to compete with someone that\u2019s got its own warehouse and sells books sometimes at a loss, or at very small profit margins. We just can\u2019t do that. So it\u2019s nice that Bookshop.org is going to rival Amazon in a way we couldn\u2019t on our own or even collectively,\u201d said Georgia Eckert, of Imagined Things bookshop in Harrogate. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have the reach, a site that\u2019s big enough, run by a proper team of people dedicated to it. We\u2019re all running our own businesses and haven\u2019t got time to be doing that.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 5 November 2020 because an earlier version referred to Bookshop.org as a B Corporation. However, the company is in the process of applying for B-Corp certification in the UK. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
