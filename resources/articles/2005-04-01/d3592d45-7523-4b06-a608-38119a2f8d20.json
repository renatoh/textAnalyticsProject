In 1783, at the age of 24, William Pitt began serving his 19 years as Prime Minister. Married only to his country (despite being offered marriage to the future Madame de Sta\u00ebl), Pitt worked tirelessly, even though he was frequently unwell, his condition exacerbated by his downing prodigious quantities of port. During his time in office, he had to steer his ship through the crises of the French Revolution, the revolutionary and Napoleonic wars and the recurrent madness of George III. In addition, throughout his career he had to engage in continual and spectacular political battles with his rival, Charles James Fox. Hague explains the government's uncertain handling of issues in terms of the slowness of travel on English roads. Pitt never went north of Northampton or west of Weymouth, and vital battle messages could take many months. As well as his public persona, Hague reveals Pitt's private side, as seen in his terrible grief at the death of his sister following childbirth. There is an affinity between Hague and Pitt which gives this a piquancy, and Hague's familiar, warm voice with its northern vowels stresses Pitt's humanity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
