There can be no other species so aware of clothes and how to use them to their advantage, and no other fashion editors would appear to have a more different attitude to clothes, and what they want from clothes, than Lucinda Chambers and Sophia Neophitou. Chambers is the fashion director of British Vogue and is all quiet restraint, with a soft voice and a nice line in gentle understatement. She is also a consultant to the Italian fashion label Marni, which specialises in loose, even baggy, prettily patterned clothes, a style that Chambers has worn throughout her adult life. Neophitou is the Greek-born, British-based fashion director of Russian Vogue, editor of 10 magazine and the owner of easily the filthiest laugh of any fashion editor around. She is flamboyant, funny and fabulous, a Greek mama with a Chanel handbag. She also works as a consultant to Roland Mouret, the London-based French designer who shot to international prominence last year thanks to his Galaxy dress, a cleverly constructed dress that gives all women an hourglass shape. It became ubiquitous on the red carpet and was a good reflection of Mouret's general style: figure hugging but encouraging of curves and Neophitou, with her curvaceous, Jessica Rabbit-esque figure and fondness for 10in heels, is Mouret's best advertisement, muse and inspiration. Improbably, the two have agreed to swap styles for a day, a thought that makes every other fashion editor I mention this to hoot. \"Lucinda with a cleavage?\" laughs one. \"I'd pay to see Sophia in a baggy dress,\" giggles another. Chambers and I meet in a coffee shop and I am a little disappointed that she has hidden herself beneath an engulfing belted coat, though she promises that beneath this she has on the Roland Mouret outfit that she has agreed to wear for the day. She prefers baggy clothes because \"There's something very private about them,\" she says. \"There is no way I'd go into the office wearing this. People would comment and I just couldn't bear it.\" But what is it that she couldn't bear? She looks down. \"These clothes are very sexy and I don't dress to express my sexuality -quite the opposite, some could say. I don't see myself as overtly sexual and I don't want people to think I'm trying to be something I'm not. Does that make sense?\" She recently did a shoot with Trinny and Susannah and the latter, with typical bluntness, informed Chambers that she dresses like \"a 12-year-old anorexic\" - an allegation that \"shocked\" her. She did, she remembers, wear \"sexy clothes\" once. It was a little black dress \"with all this boob support, and everyone kept talking to my tits, which made me incredibly uncomfortable\". A friend asked if she was having an affair. \"I actually have a similar figure to Sophia,\" she says. I say I simply don't believe her because she always looks so waifish in her loose and floaty clothes. Only now does she nervously loosen her coat to allow me a peep at her outfit. \"You've got cleavage!\" I cry, astonished at this secret that has always remained hidden beneath her layers of chiffon. She blushes and quickly buckles up again. \"I never show it off. My husband quite likes it that it's like my little secret. But he did really love how I look in Roland's clothes this morning. He said,\" she says, blushing again, \"I looked adorable.\" But that wouldn't encourage her to dress more sexily? \"No, because I dress for myself.\" But isn't such sartorial self-deprecation unusual in a fashion editor? She smiles. \"I think people are often disappointed when they meet me because I don't look like someone at Vogue.\" But there is also a fashion editor's logic behind her style: \"With my clothes, I feel I can do more to them: I can add a belt here, pin a brooch there, wear flats or high heels and create my own look. Roland's clothes make you into a certain type of person. There is a liberation in that, as that can be a relief, but it's not how I dress. Even as a teenager I didn't want to look like anyone else - I was a punk and I'd make my own clothes.\" Chambers is now in her late 40s and says that her clothes \"make me feel like I'm in my 20s again because you can play with them. In Roland's clothes you have to be very grown up and I'm not sure if I'm ready for that yet. It's quite hard to acknowledge you have to change.\" The next week, I meet Sophia Neophitou at Vogue House. I can hear her loud laughter about five minutes before she walks into the room, dressed in her usual style of a figure-hugging Roland Mouret dress, a small cardigan straining flirtatiously over her bust and eight-inch high wedges. \"There's no two ways about it, I am curvy,\" she says, gesturing towards her impressive bust. \"So the more layers I wear, the bigger I look, which is why I try to stick to just one or two pieces. I think that in the attempt to disguise their curves by wearing lots of layers, a lot of British women actually make themselves look like Demis Roussos,\" and she's off again, laughing wickedly. But to show off exactly what you have does take a certain amount of body confidence. Neophitou agrees. \"I love my figure, I am completely happy in my own skin. I've inherited a Mediterranean figure from my mother and it's a waste of energy to wish you were something you're not. I wouldn't want to be skinny, anyway, as my eyes and nose would just look enormous.\" But although she's happy to flaunt her curves she is \"not into bareness - I would never wear a strapless minidress, for example. Instead, I've got good ankles, good wrists and boobs I've had since I was 12 and I'll bust a groove on that.\" Roland Mouret arrives at this point, ready to take his collaborator out to lunch, but first she disappears to change into a Marni dress (as picked out for her by Chambers). For the past two seasons, unquestionably his most successful, he says that Neophitou has \"very much influenced me, along with Scarlett [Johansson]. These are women with boobs and womanly sensuality and I wanted to work around that. The women who wear my clothes enjoy their bodies; they enjoy being a woman.\" But why does he think that is relatively rare? He does a Gallic little shrug. \"Partly it's about what is considered politically correct but still sexy, but also because some women feel they are trapped in the wrong body. Like, they see themselves as small breasted but look in the mirror and see big breasts.\" Does he think his clothes are sexy? \"No, it's the women who make them sexy. You see a dress on a hanger and that's not sexy.\" Neophitou reappears, undeniably looking twice her normal size and very uncomfortable in a voluminous green dress which she has crossly ripped open at the top to show off her bust (\"You have to give me that at least!\" she pleads.) \"I look like a big fat elephant!\" she cries out, attracting more than a few glances in the Cond\u00e9 Nast canteen. \"I look pregnant!\" \"No, no, Sophia,\" says Mouret, determined to be kind about a fellow designer. \"If you just pin the dress back a bit like this ...\" Chambers walks in at this point, looks at Neophitou and laughs. \"Why aren't you wearing a belt?\" she asks, pointing at Neophitou's seemingly pregnant tummy. \"What belt? There was no belt!\" Neophitou all but wails. \"You know, Roland,\" Chambers says, turning to the designer, \"I loved your outfit, but I suddenly had all this cleavage and all this attitude and I just couldn't bear it! I had to run out to Miss Selfridge and buy this!\" She points at her loose beige jumper and knee length, multilayered white skirt which she has somehow made look incredibly stylish. \"I just couldn't bear everyone talking to me like this,\" and she leans forward, staring intently at the V in Mouret's V-neck. \"But Lucinda, all this is so hard,\" says Neophitou, waving vaguely at her pattern-clad body. \"I never wear accessories. I feel like I'm attracting attention with all this print and the accessories.\" \"But that's how I felt with all the attitude, I just couldn't do it. Sophia, you're loud ...\" and Neophitou makes another loud cackle ... \"you're vivacious, you're out there ...\" \"But this isn't quiet, Lucinda!\" replies Neophitou, gesturing at the lime-green print. \"You know, you think you're comfortable in your own body and then you put on a different style and you ...\" Realise you're not? \"Yeah, I guess. It's weird that, isn't it?\" Mouret looks at the two women inspecting one another and smiles: \"But really, you could put either of them in anything and really, they'd still be the same,\" he says. \"Lucinda and Sophia will always be the same\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
