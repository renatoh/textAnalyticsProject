Quite apart from helping pacify Leicester\u2019s high-powered attacking armoury along the road to penalties, Yoshinori Muto, Matty Longstaff and company probably convinced a few more Tyneside doubters to offer Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s successor the benefit of considerable doubt. Ultimately, though, the two penalties Kasper Schmeichel saved from Jonjo Shelvey and Isaac Hayden, prefaced Jamie Vardy \u2013 who else? \u2013 sealing the shootout and securing Brendan Rodgers\u2019 side a third-round trip to Luton. Leicester\u2019s manager swerved the post-match media debrief but Bruce\u2019s satisfaction with his side\u2019s superb defensive display was tempered by anger at the wince-inducing tackle from Hamza Choudhury, shortly before half time, which left Matt Ritchie very much in the wars and the Leicester midfielder lucky to be merely booked. \u201cA horror challenge, over the top, awful,\u201d said Newcastle\u2019s manager. \u201cMatt\u2019s leg is in a mess. We fear ankle damage; there\u2019s three different wounds, stitches in three different places. It\u2019s a blatant red card but the referee\u2019s five yards away and he\u2019s missed it.\u201d Sensibly, Rodgers withdrew Choudhury at the interval. Newcastle\u2019s manager had promised to \u201cgive it a go\u201d in the cups but was adamant injuries dictated he had no option to make seven changes from the side which won at Tottenham on Sunday. In truth, Saturday\u2019s Premier League game at home to Watford was always going to be the priority. In contrast there were only two alterations to a Leicester starting XI in which Ayoze P\u00e9rez returned to St James\u2019 Park following his \u00a330m summer transfer and found his way to goal swiftly blocked by a fabulous interception on the excellent Fabian Sch\u00e4r\u2019s part. With Sch\u00e4r and Federico Fern\u00e1ndez frustrating Vardy, Newcastle held their own until the England midfielder in waiting otherwise known as James Maddison wrong-footed Karl Darlow from a free-kick courtesy of a hefty deflection off Ritchie\u2019s shoulder. Early in the second half Muto tapped in the equaliser after Jetro Willems \u2013 athletically dynamic throughout \u2013 met Sch\u00e4r\u2019s free-kick and burst into the area. When the Netherlands left-back appeared to be fouled the referee played advantage, allowing the ball to run into the Japan forward\u2019s incisive path. The way was paved for penalties. The night\u2019s other shootout ended in anticlimax for League Two side Forest Green, who held Bournemouth to a goalless draw at the Vitality Stadium across 90 minutes but missed all of their spot kicks and lost 3-0. Sunderland were the big winners from the lower leagues, travelling to Burnley and beating them 3-1. Jay Rodriguez had put Sean Dyche\u2019s side ahead but the League One promotion hopefuls stuck back with three goals in 15 minutes either side of half-time, via Will Grigg, Tom Flanagan and George Dobson. There was another surprise at Loftus Road where late goals from John Marquis \u2013 from the spot \u2013 and Marcus Harness gave Portsmouth a 2-0 victory at Championship club QPR. A goal six minutes into stoppage time by the Kosovo striker Atdhe Nuhiu gave Sheffield Wednesday a dramatic 1-0 win at Rotherham. Meanwhile, Swansea\u2019s flying start to the season continued with a 6-0 demolition of Cambridge. Kristoffer Peterson, George Byers, Jordan Garrick and a Sam Surridge pair put them five up at the break, Wayne Routledge adding one more 14 minutes from time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
