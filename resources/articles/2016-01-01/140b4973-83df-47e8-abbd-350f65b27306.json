It\u2019s part of our DNA.\u201d It always seemed slightly generous when Maarten Meijer, Van Gaal\u2019s biographer, remembers the Dutchman\u2019s first spell at Camp Nou for his \u201cbelief in tactical rigour\u201d bringing him into conflict with many of his players and meaning \u201cthe team always seemed on the verge of imploding\u201d. Van Gaal won trophies but his rigid system meant he had little time for Rivaldo or indeed the club\u2019s other Brazilians. \u201cVan Gaal left the club with a good record but struggled throughout to connect with the Catalan fans,\u201d Meijer writes. They did not seem particularly happy at Old Trafford either during Saturday\u2019s FA Cup tie against Sheffield United when Van Gaal\u2019s team clocked up 10 successive home games where they have not managed a first-half goal and eventually scraped through with a stoppage-time penalty. It has become a recurring theme and makes Old Trafford, goals-wise, officially the most boring ground in England\u2019s four professional leagues, featuring 16 goals for both home and away side in total \u2013 the lowest figure of all 92 clubs, followed by Blackburn Rovers (18), Stoke City and Aston Villa (19) and Bradford City (20). At Europe\u2019s other superpowers, Van Gaal would almost certainly have lost his job after what has been, for United, the worst run in a quarter of a century. That, however, was not something he wanted to contemplate when it was put to him that Barcelona, for example, would have moved him out. \u201cYou are suggesting and then I have to answer,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to answer on suggestions.\u201d His team have, in fairness, won their last two games going into Tuesday\u2019s trip to Newcastle United but the style of play has not just led to lacerating comments from Paul Scholes and the other former United players Van Gaal calls \u201cthe legends\u201d now offering their thoughts as television analysts. There were ironic cheers when Memphis Depay, a substitute, tried a shot at the weekend and a large-scale walkout before the final whistle, to a degree that never used to happen when the team had a reputation for late goals and drama. Van Gaal, describing journalists as \u201cvery negative\u201d for pursuing this line, accepted the crowd had probably not been anticipating a goal. \u201cThey are not thinking we could score. But also maybe it\u2019s because of the traffic. As a manager, when I went to matches to analyse opponents I have done that as well. I would leave the stadium five minutes before the end.\u201d It can get pretty snarled up on Chester Road but the point is that the fans have not liked what they have seen for a long time. \u201cI can understand that,\u201d Van Gaal said about the crowd\u2019s reaction. \u201cIt was a fact that we were not shooting too much. They were ironic [cheers], I can imagine.\u201d In a different era Sir Alex Ferguson would go to the touchline if he was unhappy with the way the team were playing. Van Gaal, however, did not like the suggestion that he should try the same. \u201cI\u2019m not Sir Alex, as you know. Everybody is different and I don\u2019t believe in yelling from the sidelines. I believe in communication during the week, during the preparation and I believe in my players who have to perform.\u201d Instead Van Gaal continues to insist it was the right decision to go into the season with so few attackers, on the basis that he does not like competition for places. \u201cOur difficulty is not our defensive organisation \u2013 that you can see. But the stats in the attacking direction are not so good so we have to improve that part, especially in the third and fourth phase. That is where our intention is going, too. At this moment we have a lack of creativity. We have to lift that and we are very busy with that. \u201cEvery week I\u2019m saying we have to improve in the third or fourth phase.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
