C&amp;W believes the deal will give it the scale to take on the power of BT. While talks between the two companies have been going on for almost two years, recent changes in the regulatory environment have given the firm the confidence to do a deal. \"This is a good day for the telecoms industry, a good day for Cable &amp; Wireless and I am confident a good day for Energis,\" said C&amp;W's chief executive, Francesco Caio. While the Energis brand name will be dropped, C&amp;W intends to slowly move its customers, including such high-profile names as the BBC and Thomas Cook, on to its new internet-based network, saving costs and increasing the range of services it can offer. Energis's creditors accepted the C&amp;W offer, which will see them walk off with about \u00a3792m in cash, including a deferred consideration, late on Monday. This was despite a last-minute attempt by its Scottish rival Thus to table a \u00a3800m offer. The chief executive of Energis, John Pluthero, one of the founders of Freeserve, said the Thus offer had \"attractive headlines but very little substance\" and was ultimately too little too late. \"Full marks for trying though,\" he added. Mr Pluthero will be joining C&amp;W as the head of its British business, receiving an increase on the \u00a3500,000-a-year salary he picked up at Energis. He will also receive a significant slice of the bonus scheme which was set up within Energis when it was bought out by the banks. That pot is worth about \u00a330m and will be shared among 200 Energis managers. Mr Pluthero and the chairman, Archie Norman, who is quitting, will each receive several million pounds. Mr Pluthero admitted yesterday that the combined group was likely to lose some customers but would be better able to take on BT. \"It's a bit like getting the toy you always wanted for Christmas.\" Part of the rationale behind the deal is to reduce the \u00a3300m a year that C&amp;W pays to BT to provide access to its customers. C&amp;W is paying \u00a3594m in cash for Energis, taking on \u00a337m of finance leases and offering a further tranche of deferred consideration based on its own share price performance over the next three years. Based on its current share price, that deferred reward is worth about \u00a335m. A further \u00a3126m of cash, which Energis had on its books, has also been paid back to the creditors who saved the company from collapse three years ago, meaning they have received about \u00a3792m for the business. C&amp;W is also pumping \u00a335m into the business as short-term funding. While the deal has been expected for several weeks, shares in C&amp;W dropped 4% to 156.25p yesterday, valuing the business at \u00a33.7bn, as the company admitted that the deal would hit earnings and halt its continuing share buyback programme. C&amp;W reckons the cost of the deal, integrating Energis and sacking 700 people, will be up to \u00a3100m. For that, the company is aiming for annual cost savings of \u00a380m by 2008 with the merger benefiting its earnings from next year. This year the deal will reduce C&amp;W's earnings by \u00a35m and delay \u00a315m of cost savings previously expected. After the deal and the costs of an already announced upgrade to its own network, C&amp;W will have only \u00a3350m remaining of the \u00a31.3bn of cash it had in the bank at the end of March."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
