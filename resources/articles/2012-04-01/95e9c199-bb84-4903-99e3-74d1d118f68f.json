It's set during the first world war, but is hardly what you'd call a war film. Similarly, it involves escapes from PoW camps but isn't really a movie about escape. Renoir's approach was always too subtle to make movies full of blatant hectoring. A French pilot (Jean Gabin) and captain (Pierre Fresnay) are shot down and imprisoned behind enemy lines. They are taken to prison camps where escape is treated as a sport (\"A golf course is for golf \u2026 a prison camp for escape.\"). While we see the planning in great detail (much repeated in The Great Escape) Renoir is more interested in the microcosm of society that the camps present, particularly that presided over by the aristocratic Eric von Stroheim. As these are officers' camps, the horrors of war aren't really delved into. If anything, this allows a more casual, timeless style of acting, which has helped the film endure many subsequent cinematic fads. While greeted as a classic upon release, it's been in the years since that the real potency of La Grande Illusion has come to the fore. Renoir's humanitarian messages are relevant and oft repeated but, sadly, oft ignored too.
