The Rolling Stones rocker will star in the film Keith Richards \u2013 The Origin of the Species, directed by Julien Temple, which will be a centrepiece of the BBC\u2019s My Generation season about the history of pop music. \u201cThere was a feeling late \u201850s/early \u201860s that there was a change coming,\u201d Richards says in the film, which will air on the BBC next month. \u201cHarold Macmillan actually said it \u2013 \u2018The winds of change\u2019 and all that \u2013 but he didn\u2019t mean it in quite the same way. I certainly felt that my generation and what was happening and the feeling in the air \u2013 was it\u2019s time to push limits. The world is ours now and you can rise or fall on it.\u201d Richards\u2019s weekend of programmes for BBC4 will feature two nights of shows hand-picked by the man himself, the first time the BBC4 schedules have been taken over in this way, each introduced by the guitarist. The BBC said the film by Temple, whose other credits include Glastonbury, Absolute Beginners and the Great Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Swindle, would \u201creclaim on film for the first time\u201d Richards\u2019s roots growing up in south-east London. Temple, who made a concert film in 1991 with the band called Stones at the Max, said: \u201cListening to the early Stones as a kid changed everything for me. I felt a new way of living emerging, a new kind of person becoming possible \u2013 something I wanted to be a part of. \u201cAnd without a doubt I thought Keith Richards was the origin of the species. This film sets out to explore how both he and the \u201860s in England came about.\u201d Richards, 72, is still touring with the Rolling Stones and they are expected to release an album of new material later this year. He published his autobiography, Life, to critical acclaim six years ago. He also became an unlikely film star appearing in several of the the Pirates of the Caribbean films alongside Johnny Depp. Cassian Harrison, BBC4 editor, said: \u201cKeith Richards is undoubtedly one of the key icons of our age. \u201cHis film for BBC2 will be a fascinating exploration into the post-war years, how they impacted both his life and others and influenced the 60s and the decades that followed. \u201cAnd his curated weekend of programmes for BBC4 will be a thrilling musical journey for viewers \u2013 giving an extraordinary and unique insight into Keith\u2019s passions and inspirations.\u201d Jan Younghusband, head of music TV commissioning, added: \u201cKeith Richards is an outstanding talent and an inspiration to us all. \u201cWe are thrilled to be able to bring his unique and entertaining insights to our audience, in this special collaboration with Julien Temple. I know it will be a totally original experience.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
