Extravagant, brilliant and occasionally suicidal in his artistic choices, he put himself and the Leeds-based company scarily high above the parapet during the two years he was in charge. But his successor, Sharon Watson, shows no sign of being cowed. In the company's new programme she makes a couple of reassuring nods to Phoenix's (pre-De Frutos) history, but also adds unpredictable elements into the mix. I admit I was dreading The Audacious One, Warren Adam's response to Barack Obama's 2004 \"audacity of hope\" speech. Yet there are no soggy pieties in this tautly constructed group piece. With six dancers aligned in sharp-angled antagonism, the choreography is fractured and reformed with kaleidoscopic intensity by the wheeling, graceful presence of a seventh, guest artist Paul Liburd, one of the few dancers in the world with sufficient gravitas to invoke the presence of Obama. By contrast, Isira Makuloluwe's Locked in Vertical is purely abstract, driven by Fran\u00e7ois Caffenne's commissioned score. The dance is liquid, restless; it takes unexpected routes through the four dancers' bodies and coils into brief duets. Though it doesn't quite hang together, the work is crammed with intelligent, incidental pleasures. A Phoenix classic, Philip Taylor's 1985 Haunted Passages uses Britten's Lachrymae to create a tremulous, gothic and rather sexy study of nocturnal fantasies and fears. This is followed by a new work by Aletta Collins that has the cast shouting, grunting and miaowing while dancing to a soundtrack of their own voices. Some of the comedy is overmugged, but this is a smart showcase of Phoenix's very watchable dancers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
