The real-estate mogul is now backed by 34% of Republicans likely to vote in New Hampshire\u2019s 9 February primary, according to a CNN/WMUR poll released on Wednesday \u2013 the same survey that sent shockwaves through the Democratic race with a surge for Bernie Sanders the day before. Trump\u2019s lead in the Granite State is now more than double Cruz\u2019s support, which drifts at a distant 14%, although that represents a six-point jump in support from the last CNN/WMUR survey of Republicans conducted in December. The rest of the field, according to the latest New Hampshire poll, remains relatively crowded: Former Florida governor Jeb Bush is tied for third place with fellow Floridian Marco Rubio, at 10% each. There\u2019s a three-way tie for fourth place, with Chris Christie, John Kasich and Rand Paul each pulling in the support of 6% of likely Republican primary voters. The rest of the field falls below the poll\u2019s 4.8% margin of error for support. There remains room for positivity among the lower ranks, however. A mere 31% of Republicans surveyed told CNN that they have definitively made up their minds about who they\u2019re voting for, and Cruz remains the most popular second-choice candidate, with 20% of primary voters saying that the Texan senator of Canadian extraction would be their runner-up. On the issues, Trump continues to dominate with voters. He was named the most-trusted candidate to handle both Isis and the economy by likely voters, with 32% and 48% of those surveyed saying that he\u2019s best suited to tackle them, respectively. Trump continues to be divisive among New Hampshire voters, however, with nearly one in three telling CNN that they would not vote for the billionaire frontrunner \u201cunder any circumstance\u201d. Bush is the only other candidate to crack the double digits on unpopularity, with 18% of New Hampshire voters saying that they would rather vote for any other presidential candidate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
