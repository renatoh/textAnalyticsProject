I\u2019ll leave you with news from David Conn that there are serious fears the football season may never be completed. And here\u2019s a recap of the events that have tumbled on a disheartening day all round: In football All Premier League, EFL and WSL and FAW football is suspended until April All Scottish professional and grassroots football is suspended until further notice Players from Everton, Watford and West Ham, as well as Hammers manager David Moyes, are among those self-isolating Bundesliga 1 and 2 games are off until April Ligue 1 and 2 suspended \u2018until further notice\u2019 Euro 2020 is under threat, with Uefa to meet next week to discuss the tournament\u2019s destiny England\u2019s international friendlies against Italy and Denmark have been cancelled.

It has also announced it will temporarily relax its normal rules which oblige clubs to release players for international fixtures, stating that would not apply should games go ahead. A Fifa statement said: To avoid any unnecessary health risks and also situations of potential sporting unfairness, we therefore recommend that all international matches previously scheduled to take place in March and April should now be postponed until such time that they can take place in a safe and secure environment, both for players and for the general public. The decision to carry on with National League fixtures this weekend has angered the Barrow manager, Ian Evatt: Evatt\u2019s sentiments are echoed by Dagenham\u2019s joint-owner Peter Freund: Every major sports league across the globe has postponed their seasons. The National League must do the same or be known as the most tone deaf and foolish organisation in existence. I will not support a decision to put our players, staff or supporters in harm\u2019s way. Period. Sunday\u2019s Premiership Rugby Cup final between Sale and Harlequins had been scheduled to go ahead but it has now bitten the dust after an associated individual developed symptoms consistent with the virus. Here\u2019s a statement from Premiership Rugby: Unfortunately, Sunday\u2019s Premiership Rugby Cup Final has been postponed following an individual of staff developing symptoms consistent with Coronavirus (Covid-19). The individual is now safely in isolation. We\u2019re incredibly sorry to all the people who will be disappointed, however the welfare of fans, players and staff remains our first concern, and so we must postpone the game for now. We will continue to consult with DCMS, Public Health England, and our clubs; and will announce rescheduling as soon we can. Here\u2019s our chief football correspondent, David Hytner, on the minefield that awaits football\u2019s governing bodies as they wrestle with the prospect of balancing the coronavirus crisis with trying to complete their seasons: From major club and international football to the golf and tennis tours, Covid-19 has decimated the sporting calendar. Here is an updated list of what has been affected so far, by my colleague Ed Aarons: The Manchester Marathon is the latest big run to be called off. It had been scheduled to take place on 5 April. Here\u2019s an extract from the organisers\u2019 statement: In light of escalating concerns surrounding the impact of the coronavirus COVID-19 on public health we have made the tough decision to postpone the 2020 Manchester Marathon which was due to take place on Sunday 5th April. As the organiser of a mass participation sporting event such as this we have a responsibility to ensure the safety and health of our runners, spectators and crew, and to do everything within our power to prevent the virus from spreading further. It\u2019s business as usual for rugby league and the Super League is even suggesting it could help fill in the gaps in TV schedules: Sampdoria have announced that four more of their players and a club doctor have tested positive for coronavirus after Manolo Gabbiadini\u2019s positive test a couple of days ago. Here\u2019s a statement: Sampdoria can confirm that footballers Omar Colley, Albin Ekdal, Antonino La Gumina, Morten Thorsby and club doctor Amedeo Baldari have tested positive for COVID-19, following the positive result for Manolo Gabbiadini a few days ago. All of them are in good health and are at their homes in Genoa. The club would like to reiterate that it has carried out all the necessary procedures in accordance with the law: all the club\u2019s offices are closed and the players, club officials and staff potentially infected are in voluntary self-isolation at home. All sporting activities have been suspended and essential administrative and organisational operations are being carried out remotely. Hello. It\u2019s Gregg here. I\u2019ll be updating you on any further news on a day in which coronavirus has wiped out much of the sporting calendar. Earlier, Ben posted the full text from an open letter to Liverpool supporters from the club\u2019s manager, J\u00fcrgen Klopp, in which he made it clear football is the most trivial of matters at a time when there is a public health crisis. \u201cNot only is Klopp a manager with a social conscience he does not mind putting it on display,\u201d writes Paul Wilson. You can read the full story below \u2026 If it\u2019s a choice between football and the good of the wider society it\u2019s no contest. Really, it isn\u2019t. Is it good news that the trickle of postponements and cancellations has slowed, or bad news that the world\u2019s running out of events to push back? Regardless, here\u2019s a recap of developments from an absolutely miserable day for lovers of live sport: In football All Premier League, EFL and WSL and FAW football is suspended until April All Scottish professional and grassroots football is suspended until further notice Players from Everton, Watford and West Ham, as well as Hammers manager David Moyes, are among those self-isolating Bundesliga 1 and 2 games are off until April Ligue 1 and 2 suspended \u2018until further notice\u2019 Euro 2020 is under threat, with Uefa to meet next week to discuss the tournament\u2019s destiny England\u2019s international friendlies against Italy and Denmark have been cancelled. Wales v Austria is also off Nigel Pearson hit out at Boris Johnson for his \u2018lack of leadership\u2019 on coronavirus All Champions League and Europa League games next week are off Elsewhere in the sporting world F1 grand prix in Bahrain and Vietnam have been cancelled in the wake of the race in Australia also being pulled The Masters golf major has been postponed The London Marathon has been put back from April to October from April England\u2019s cricket tour of Sri Lanka is no more The weekend\u2019s remaining Six Nations match, Wales v Scotland, is off In cycling, the Giro d\u2019Italia has been postponed, along with June\u2019s Women\u2019s Tour The Rugby Football League say fixtures will go ahead despite Leeds pulling out of their game against Catalans Dragons Even chess isn\u2019t safe Inevitably, the UK\u2019s showpiece road running race has now been postponed. In a statement, organisers said: \u201cLondon Marathon Events today announced the postponement of the 2020 Virgin Money London Marathon, which was scheduled to take place on Sunday 26 April. The 2020 Virgin Money London Marathon \u2013 The 40th Race \u2013 is now scheduled to take place on Sunday 4 October 2020.\u201d Event director Hugh Brasher said: \u201cThe world is in an unprecedented situation grappling with a global pandemic of Covid-19 and public health is everyone\u2019s priority. We know how disappointing this news will be for so many \u2013 the runners who have trained for many months, the thousands of charities for which they are raising funds and the millions who watch the race every year. \u201cWe know that there will be many, many questions from runners, charities and others and we ask you to please bear with us as we work through the detailed planning process to deliver the 2020 Virgin Money London Marathon on its new scheduled date. We will email all runners and charities today and then update them via email by the end of next week at the latest. We will also post regular updates on our website and social media channels.\u201d Meanwhile, in we\u2019re-going-to-get-through-this corner \u2026 Aston Villa have donated food that had been prepared for Saturday\u2019s game against Chelsea to homeless charities. The club said 850 staff packed lunches and hot food would be given away and asked for organisations who wished to receive the food to contact the club. In response to a Twitter appeal, the Aston Villa Foundation said: \u201cWe are pleased to say that all of the food has now been allocated to a number of homeless charities and housing shelters. Thank you Twitter for ensuring this food doesn\u2019t go to waste and it is going to those who will really benefit.\u201d Brighton later announced food originally purchased for the hospitality lounges and retail kiosks for Saturday\u2019s postponed match against Arsenal would be donated to the city\u2019s homeless community. The club has donated all surplus fresh fruit and vegetables, diary products and sandwiches to Sussex Homeless Support, which will be used to help provide food across various night shelters as well as soup kitchens in and around the Brighton and Hove area. PA Media Russia hopes to geg in on more Euro 2020 matches, as a potential solution to the threat hanging over the tournament. State news agency Tass reports that deputy prime minister Dmitry Chernyshenko says the country is willing to host more than current four matches \u2013 three group games and one quarter-final \u2013 at Zenit St Petersburg\u2019s stadium. The current fixture list splits matches across 12 different European cities. Over in France, sports clubs are being told to limit their activities to groups of no more than 10 people. The country\u2019s sports minister said clubs were free to continue their activities \u201cin a responsible manner\u201d, as long as they split up into smaller gatherings, including coaches as well as players. All Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 matches this weekend are now cancelled, having originally been ordered to be played behind closed doors. Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta, who tested postitive for coronavirus on Thursday has posted his thoughts on today\u2019s developments. A former Bury doctor has been suspended from all football-related activity for four years for a breach of the Football Association\u2019s anti-doping regulations. Dr Andrew Johnson admitted he tampered with doping control by providing fraudulent information to an anti-doping organisation \u2013 namely the FA and/or UK Anti-Doping \u2013 in relation to an application for a therapeutic use exemption (TUE) on behalf of a player. The FA said in a statement that the suspension was effective immediately and will run until the end of 13 January 2024. Johnson had sought a reduction in the sanction under Regulation 72 of the FA\u2019s anti-doping regulations, which concerns the prompt admission of a rule violation when confronted with one. However, an independent regulatory commission decided that this was not appropriate in this case. Johnson admitted deliberately backdating a form which was part of a retrospective TUE application sent by a player to UKAD in April 2019. PA Media Olympics update: still going ahead as planned, but the torch relay has gone a big wrong. Large crowds reportedly assembled in Sparta despite requests for the public to stay away. In a statement, the IOC said: \u201cWe fully understand the decision taken by the Hellenic Olympic Committee (HOC) in association with the Greek Ministry of Health to cancel the Greek leg of the Olympic Torch Relay. \u201cThe handover of the Olympic Flame will happen as scheduled on 19 March 2020. The International Olympic Committee confirms its full commitment to the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020.\u201d Anything, ANYTHING to do with torches gives me an excuse to post arguably the best video on the internet. Set aside 3min 45sec and treat yourself \u2026 Paul Pogba has some sage health advice \u2026 Hey, who\u2019s running in the Boston Marathon on 20 April? Nobody, that\u2019s who \u2013 it\u2019s now postponed to 14 September. Lots of focus will now be put on the London Marathon, but before then there are other mass participation events still pencilled in as going ahead, not least the 13,000-capacity London Landmarks Half Marathon on 29 March. I was supposed to be running a half in Limassol next weekend. Not so much now \u2013 that was pulled on Tuesday, and my flight was cancelled this morning. It\u2019s also a really interesting year to be race director of my first ever event \u2013 the Sandy 10 in Bedfordshire (not a plug \u2013 we\u2019re nearly sold out). We\u2019re holding firm at the moment, but getting nervy every time the PM goes near a microphone. I\u2019ve just had a nice mail querying how I\u2019m going to transport some gazebos from Moggerhanger to race HQ. You will absolutely never guess what the main theme of today\u2019s Fiver is \u2026 I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not alone in giving Uefa a bit of side-eye, wondering quite how bad the situation has to get across European domestic leagues before they just have a quick conference call between the various FAs and pull this summer\u2019s Euros. A meeting is due on Tuesday, and it\u2019s surely a case of when rather than if they postpone the tournament. That\u2019s enough fun for you. Here\u2019s more details from Germany \u2026 The German Football League (DFL) has called off all weekend matches in the Bundesliga and second tier Bundesliga 2 and recommended that both leagues be suspended until 2 April, it said in a statement on Friday. The decision was taken \u201cin view of the dynamics of today\u2019s events with new coronavirus infections and corresponding suspected cases directly related to the Bundesliga and Bundesliga 2,\u201d the statement said. It said a general assembly would be held on Monday where it would recommend to the clubs the both leagues be put on hold until 2 April. Many thanks to Ben for keeping his pluck during a grim day for lovers of live sport. Stuart here again to try and work out what\u2019s left. I\u2019m going to throw you a bone \u2013 something fun before I give you stuff about things being cancelled. Here\u2019s this week\u2019s Sports Quiz of the Week \u2026 This weekend\u2019s games in the top two leagues of German football have been postponed, after initially being scheduled to be played behind closed doors, the DFL have confirmed. All games have been suspended until 2 April. It seems the DFL have, belatedly, listened to Bayern Munich\u2019s Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara. Liverpool have also temporarily suspended first-team activities, joining Barcelona in halting squad training in the wake of matches being postponed. And it is difficult to envisage Liverpool being the last team to do so given they will not play until 4 April \u2013 at the earliest. \u201cPlayers have been given individual programmes to follow during this period and first-team training took place as normal today,\u201d said a statement on Friday. \u201cLiverpool will work with the club\u2019s medical team and other relevant authorities to monitor the situation and decide upon a date to return to Melwood to give the squad the best chance of preparing for their next fixture.\u201d Away from the football, the Gold Cup is about to get under way: More cycling has been postponed following news of Giro d\u2019Italia being canned, with the 2020 Women\u2019s Tour, scheduled for 8-13 June, delayed along with the domestic Tour Series circuit race series, which was due to take place across May. National League matches will go ahead as scheduled this weekend. A reminder that Harrogate have appealed to the league to postpone their match against Solihull because they have four players self-isolating but, that aside, some clubs could be on for a record attendance given the dearth of games. \u201cFollowing a board meeting held today, the National League has decided to allow matches in its three divisions to proceed as planned this weekend,\u201d read a statement on Friday afternoon. \u201cThe National League will keep the operation of its competition under constant and diligent review, and will remain in compliance with government advice at all times. The Football Association has offered its guidance, and made it clear the decision to continue or to suspend a competition is a matter for each league to make. The National League places the welfare and well-being of all those involved in and connected to its competition as the highest priority.\u201d Barcelona have suspended all first-team activity until further notice on medical advice. \u201cIn the coming days, the players will follow a personalised and specific physical workout plan from their homes, supervised by the team\u2019s trainers,\u201d the club says. The La Liga side say the decision was made following a meeting this morning between president Josep Bartomeu, Dr Jaume Padr\u00f3s, the president of the Barcelona Medical Association and the head of occupational healthcare at the club, and Dr Antoni Trilla, the head of epidemiology at Hospital Cl\u00ednic. Hull City are the latest club to donate food ordered for matchday following the suspension of games, with Aston Villa confirming 850 staff packed lunches are being donated to support homeless charities. \u201cWith food having already been delivered to the Kcom Stadium for tomorrow\u2019s game, the club was keen to ensure it didn\u2019t go to waste,\u201d read a club statement. \u201cFresh fruit, vegetables and sandwiches have now been passed over to FareShare Hull &amp; Humber, a charity that redistributes surplus food to over 120 organisations throughout the region. The club are pleased that this surplus food will go to people who really need it.\u201d The National League rumbles on ... or does it? Harrogate Town have appealed to the league to postpone Friday\u2019s match with Solihull Moors, because they have four employees in self-isolation. \u201cWe have a duty of care for the health and wellbeing of players, staff and supporters,\u201d they said in a statement. Harrogate are second in the league. Solihull, who this afternoon confirmed the signing of striker Adam Rooney, are seventh. Some League One reaction, courtesy of the Bristol Rovers manager Ben Garner. \u201cUltimately the health and welfare of everyone is more important than football,\u201d he says. \u201cAll we can do is follow the advice of the experts and hope for the most important win in beating coronavirus. Thoughts and prayers go out to everyone affected.\u201d In the Championship, Fulham were due to host Brentford on Friday evening but every EFL match has been postponed. If \u2013 and it\u2019s a big if \u2013 the Scottish Premiership season cannot be completed, Celtic should be crowned champions, so-says Neil Lennon. The SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster confirmed on Friday said it was \u201cneither realistic nor possible\u201d to continue amid the coronavirus outbreak. Lennon, whose side are 13 points clear at the top of the league, described the situation as a \u201cnightmare\u201d and added: \u201cIf it was to stop now I would doubt very much that they would say it was null and void. It could be death by a thousand cuts. We have played over 30 games, that\u2019s well over two thirds of the season so we should be declared champions.\u201d David Moyes is among the West Ham personnel self-isolating after coming into contact with Mikel Arteta, the Arsenal manager who has tested positive for coronavirus. West Ham, one of eight clubs to have at least one employee in self-isolation, has \u201calready taken a number of precautionary measures\u201d, including deep cleans at the club\u2019s training grounds as well as the London Stadium. Moyes came into contact with Arteta during a 1-0 defeat at the Emirates Stadium on 7 March. Meanwhile, an Inverness Caledonian Thistle player is currently in self-isolation after showing symptoms associated with coronavirus. The Scottish Championship club are awaiting the results of tests on the unnamed player. Twenty-four hours notice for rugby-goers: The Masters has been held every year since 1945 \u2013 but this year\u2019s tournament has been postponed owing to the coronavirus. Fred Ridley, chairman of Augusta National, said: \u201cThe health and well-being of everyone associated with these events and the citizens of the Augusta community led us to this decision.\u201d The football calendar has been decimated but a few sporting nuggets appear to have survived \u2013 for now at least. \u201cThe British Basketball League is currently continuing to play a full set of fixtures this weekend,\u201d emails Shaun Thorpe. \u201cAll broadcast live on youtube for free. As things stand, the Bath Half Marathon is also set to go ahead.\u201d The Netball Superleague is also set to continue. Word from the Channel Islands ... Guernsey FC say that Saturday\u2019s Isthmian League game at Sevenoaks Town has been postponed on the advice of the States of Guernsey, who say that \u201cislanders should avoid travelling into and out of the Bailiwick for non-essential reasons with immediate effect\u201d. Meanwhile the Guernsey marathon has been postponed until October. Again, in case you missed this story among everything else: Is there anything left to be postponed? OK, so the National League is still going ahead and the Bundesliga are going to give behind-closed-doors games another crack on Saturday but, apart from that, it\u2019s slim pickings in the world of sport. Ben\u2019s back for more of this mental punishment. I don\u2019t envy him. Chins up all. \u2026 while in golf, The Masters, the first major of the year due to start on 9 April \u2026 not so much. Full story here \u2026 Over on the rugby beat, and in no way not inevitably \u2026 The pilot of the plane carrying the professional footballer Emiliano Sala was not licensed to fly the aircraft when it plunged into the sea, killing both of them, an official report has concluded. David Ibbotson had not completed night flying training and his private pilot\u2019s licence did not permit him to be paid for carrying passengers, the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) found. The regulations under which the Piper Malibu light aircraft was operated also meant it should have not been flown commercially. Investigators found such unlicensed flights frequently took place in the world of sport, business and leisure. Bayern Munich\u2019s Thiago Alc\u00e2ntra has taken unkindly to the German Bundesliga\u2019s decision to go ahead with the weekend\u2019s fixtures. His side are due to play Union Berlin behind closed doors on Saturday, part of a full programme of games, but he responded to a tweet from the German Football League (DFL) saying: \u201cThis is crazy. Please stop fooling around and land on reality. Let\u2019s be honest, there are much more important priorities than sport.\u201d At odds with other European leagues, the DFL has said the top two divisions will play this weekend, but then matches would be suspended from next Tuesday until 2 April. Afternoon all. Stuart here allowing Ben some respite. Oh but there\u2019s no respite, as proper journalism\u2019s David Conn reports \u2026 BT Sport are not offering refunds to subscribers for the lack of live Premier League, Champions League, Bundesliga and other competitions to which they have TV rights, as broadcasters grapple with the mass postponement of sports due to the coronavirus pandemic. The company is planning to fill its schedules with any live sport which carries on, reruns of matches already played this season, WWE films and documentaries. Its current position is that as, so far, only two rounds of Premier League matches have been postponed \u2013 until 4 April \u2013 and Uefa has postponed only next week\u2019s Champions and Europa League matches, it hopes to resume broadcasting live sport before too long. In a statement, a BT spokesman said: \u201cWe apologise to customers about the changes to the BT Sport schedule this month due to the impact of Covid-19. The situation is evolving rapidly and we are working with the leagues to continue to broadcast live sport wherever possible and broadcast games when they are rescheduled over the coming months. We will continue to broadcast a wide range of BT Sport content including films and documentaries and we will update our customers as we have a clearer view of the remainder of the season.\u201d Story in full below \u2026 J\u00fcrgen Klopp has penned an open letter to supporters: I don\u2019t think this is a moment where the thoughts of a football manager should be important, but I understand for our supporters they will want to hear from the team and I will front that. First and foremost, all of us have to do whatever we can to protect one another. In society I mean. This should be the case all the time in life, but in this moment I think it matters more than ever. I\u2019ve said before that football always seems the most important of the least important things. Today, football and football matches really aren\u2019t important at all. Of course, we don\u2019t want to play in front of an empty stadium and we don\u2019t want games or competitions suspended, but if doing so helps one individual stay healthy - just one - we do it no questions asked. If it\u2019s a choice between football and the good of the wider society, it\u2019s no contest. Really, it isn\u2019t. Today\u2019s decision and announcement is being implemented with the motive of keeping people safe. Because of that we support it completely. We have seen members of teams we compete against become ill. This virus has shown that being involved in football offers no immunity. To our rival clubs and individuals who are affected and to those who later will become so, you are in our thoughts and prayers. None of us know in this moment what the final outcome will be, but as a team we have to have belief that the authorities make decisions based on sound judgement and morality. Yes, I am the manager of this team and club and therefore carry a leadership responsibility with regards to our future on the pitch. But I think in the present moment, with so many people around our city, the region, the country and the world facing anxiety and uncertainty, it would be entirely wrong to speak about anything other than advising people to follow expert advice and look after themselves and each other. The message from the team to our supporters is only about your well-being. Put your health first. Don\u2019t take any risk. Think about the vulnerable in our society and act where possible with compassion for them. Please look after yourselves and look out for each other. You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone, J\u00fcrgen It\u2019s not football ... but the Giro d\u2019Italia has been postponed. The cycling event was due to take place between 9-31 May. In response to the spread of the coronavirus, the Hungarian government has declared a state of emergency. This means the Giro\u2019s start in Budapest cannot take place in Hungary as planned. As it stands, National League matches remain on, though there is a board meeting taking place this afternoon. The Chesterfield manager, John Pemberton, has described the situation as \u201ccrazy\u201d. The Bundesliga will play behind closed doors on Saturday, while there are matches planned in Turkey and Russia. Manchester United react to the suspension of Premier League matches, with Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r thanking supporters for their backing. \u201cI would like to thank our fans for their tremendous support so far this season and we look forward to welcoming them back to Old Trafford as soon as is safely possible,\u201d he says. Ed Woodward adds: \u201cWhile it is disappointing to see the season paused, we recognise there are bigger considerations as part of the need to help slow the spread of coronavirus.\u201d Meanwhile at Cheltenham, the first race is moments away: Southampton sent their players home earlier and, at the moment, the plan is for training to resume on Monday. The players will be given a weekend off after the postponement of Saturday\u2019s Premier League trip to Norwich City. No Southampton players are showing any symptoms of coronavirus. The Irish FA have also suspended all matches at domestic and grassroots levels following a meeting this morning, copying the steps taking by the Premier League and co. \u201cWe expect games to restart on Saturday 4 April 2020. The matter will be kept under constant review,\u201d they say. Anyone know when Premier League Years next airs? The Premier League, the Football League, the Football Association and the Women\u2019s Super League have suspended all matches until the weekend of 3-5 April in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Liverpool have a released a statement saying they \u201cwelcome\u201d the Premier League\u2019s decision to postpone all matches and confirm they have implemented precautions across its sites to \u201cminimise the spread of the coronavirus\u201d. Confirmation of F1 races being chopped: Premier League big hitters need to support lower-league clubs in the wake of the financial impact of the coronavirus, says Peterborough owner Darragh MacAnthony. \u201cThere is going to be financial shortfalls for many clubs, cashflow issues,\u201d MacAnthony said, speaking to talkSPORT. \u201cI would guess-timate the average League One and Two club is probably going to need a loan of \u00a3300k to \u00a3400k each. There\u2019s enough money in football. We need to come together and make sure nobody goes under because of this virus.\u201d Reaction: Aston Villa\u2019s chief executive, Christian Purslow, battles past the assembled media at the Premier League\u2019s London headquarters and has his say on the suspension of matches. \u201cI think it\u2019s a very good decision,\u201d he says. We\u2019ve got great league management \u2013 they\u2019ve made the right decision.\u201d Is he confident the league will resume on 4 April? \u201cNone of us know. We\u2019ll see.\u201d Domestic football is hit in Wales. The Football Association of Wales has taken the decision to suspend domestic football \u201cat all levels in Wales with immediate effect until 4 April\u201d due to the Covid-19 outbreak. \u201cThe intention at this time will be to resume the football schedule depending on the medical advice and conditions from the relevant authorities at that time,\u201d reads a FAW statement. \u201cThe FAW is fully aware of the impact this will have on the domestic game but the health and safety of all fans, players, volunteers and stakeholders are of paramount importance.\u201d Kudos to Aston Villa: On Thursday afternoon Boris Johnson said there was \u201cno medical reason\u201d to ban sporting events. Less than 24 hours later, the Premier League, EFL, FA, Scottish FA and WSL take matters into their own hands and follow the lead of European leagues, with La Liga, Eredivisie and Ligue 1 among those to chop matches: In egg-shaped ball news, the Premiership Rugby cup final between Sale Sharks and Harlequins has been given the green light to go ahead on Sunday. \u201cWe will continue to work closely with government on a schedule for the remainder of the season, should the guidance on sporting events change,\u201d a Sale statement said on Friday. \u201cWe will keep updating our plans with new information as it is released, and ensure our clubs and fans are updated with developments as soon as they happen.\u201d Reaction from the Championship: Luton Town\u2019s chief executive, Gary Sweet, has said \u201cevery club will have an absolutely huge dent in its cashflows\u201d. Speaking to talkSPORT, Sweet says: \u201cWe, along with lots of other businesses, are going to be dealing with a really financial difficult period, regardless of what the situation is.\u201d As for Euro 2020, he says: \u201cIt just cannot go ahead, can it?\u201d The coronavirus chaos extends to ... chess: Wales have, unsurprisingly, canned their international with Austria, which was due to be played on 27 March. Wales v USA has already bitten the dust. \u201cThe FAW has made this decision in light of recent developments, with the aim of putting the health and safety of all fans, players and stakeholders first and foremost.\u201d You heard the man ... Somehow Cheltenham soldiers on: There is plenty to mull over. Sign up to The Recap: The Scottish Football Association has confirmed they have suspended all professional and grassroots football in Scotland until further notice. Ian Maxwell, the Scottish FA chief executive, said: \u201cToday\u2019s announcement is made in the interests of public health but, equally, the health and safety of players, match officials, and staff across the game. This is of paramount importance as the country enters the \u2018delay\u2019 phase of the coronavirus pandemic.\u201d An eighth Premier League club confirm self-isolation measures: West Ham United say personnel who came into contact with Arsenal\u2019s manager, Mikel Arteta, who tested positive for coronavirus, are quarantining as a precaution. They say they have \u201calready taken a number of precautionary measures\u201d, including deep cleans at the club\u2019s training grounds as well as the London Stadium. Arsenal, Bournemouth, Chelsea, Everton, Leicester, Manchester City, Watford and now West Ham United have at least one employee in self-isolation. In rugby league, meanwhile, all is rosy: Football, it is fair to say, is at a standstill: \u2022 Premier League, EFL and WSL postponed until 3 April \u2022 England\u2019s internationals at Wembley postponed \u2022 Uefa postpone next week\u2019s European matches \u2022 Euro 2020 under threat, with Uefa to meet on Tuesday \u2022 Bundesliga to be suspended after games this weekend \u2022 Serie A, Eredivisie, MLS and Primeira Liga postponed \u2022 La Liga cancel \u2018at least next two rounds of matches\u2019 \u2022 Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 suspended \u2018until further notice\u2019 \u2022 Wales international against USA postponed More reaction: Stoke City\u2019s chairman, Peter Coates, reckons the suspension of matches could have grave implications on some Football League clubs. \u201cThe way players have gone down and how things have escalated, we have got to a point where we had little choice,\u201d he said, speaking to BBC 5Live. \u201cI don\u2019t think the financial implications will hit the Premier League hard because their income comes from media and broadcasting, so they have a cushion against this. For the rest of football, it\u2019s quite different as they rely on gate receipts and commercial activities, with a very small part coming from the media. This will have serious financial implications, with some clubs possibly running out of money.\u201d Reaction from the Championship: Swansea City\u2019s chairman, Trevor Birch, acknowledges the postponement of matches was \u201cinevitable\u201d. In a statement, Birch said: \u201cThe health and wellbeing of our staff, supporters, their families and the wider public will always remain of paramount importance to the football club. The decision to postpone fixtures was inevitable and totally understandable for what is an unprecedented and dynamically developing situation. We all hope we can get back to normal as soon as possible, but the priority at the moment is for everyone to follow the health advice available and stay safe.\u2019\u2019 You may have missed it but, in today\u2019s only game, Nigel Pearson scored an absolute peach against the prime minister: Word from the Premier League, following that meeting between all 20 clubs at their headquarters in London. \u201cIt was unanimously decided to suspend the Premier League with the intention of returning on 4 April, subject to medical advice and conditions at the time,\u201d they say. The Premier League\u2019s chief executive, Richard Masters, describes this is an \u201cunprecedented sitaution\u201d and adds: \u201cAbove all, we wish Mikel Arteta and Callum Hudson-Odoi speedy recoveries, and everyone else affected by Covid-19. In this unprecedented situation, we are working closely with our clubs, government, The FA and EFL and can reassure everyone the health and welfare of players, staff and supporters are our priority. Despite the challenges, it is the Premier League\u2019s aim to reschedule the displaced fixtures, including those played by academy sides, when it is safe to do so. In this fast-moving environment, further updates will be provided when appropriate.\u201d \u201cAny word yet on the lowly National League being suspended or going ahead?\u201d emails Ian Connor. The FA says it is liaising with the men and women\u2019s league\u2019s pyramids and \u201cwill continue to offer guidance and support. Any decision to continue playing or to postpone their respective competitions is a matter for each league as autonomous bodies within the game\u201d ... The Football Association have confirmed England\u2019s friendlies against Italy and Denmark will no longer take place later this month, with the FA confirming the cancellation of \u201cEngland team fixtures at every level\u201d. The FA state \u201call parties are committed at this time to trying to complete this season\u2019s domestic fixture programme and are liaising to establish appropriate options to do so\u201d. So, confirmation from the powers that be that the Premier League, Football League and Women\u2019s Super League will shutdown until at least 3 April. In a statement, the EFL said this action \u201cwill be kept under constant review\u201d and a further update will be given following another EFL board meeting next week. The postponements include all matches in the Championship, League One and League Two, as well as all academy and youth-team fixtures. In addition, clubs have been advised to suspend indefinitely all non-essential activities, including player appearances, training-ground visits and fan meetings. \u201cThis decision has not been taken lightly, but the EFL must prioritise the health and well-being of players, staff and supporters while also acknowledging the Government\u2019s national efforts in tackling this outbreak,\u201d said the EFL in a statement. Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara, the Bayern Munich and Spain midfielder, has had his say, since deleting a tweet that reportedly described the DFL\u2019s decision to play Bundesliga matches this weekend ahead of a planned suspension as \u201cirresponsible\u201d. He added: \u201cThis is crazy. Please stop fooling around and land on reality. Let\u2019s be honest, there are much more important priorities than any sport.\u201d The EFL have confirmed the unprecedented measure after \u201cin light of overnight developments\u201d, ie news of the Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta and Chelsea winger Callum Hudson-Odoi testing positive for coronavirus. The EFL board convened on Friday morning and have determined that all \u201cfootball activity scheduled to take place this weekend and until 3 April will be postponed\u201d. We\u2019ve discussed the Premier League and English Football League at length, but what about the Football Association, I hear you ask ... well, it seems the FA are set to scrap England\u2019s friendlies with Italy and Denmark later this month. Wales have already cancelled their date with USA in Cardiff on 30 March, while their match against Austria in Swansea looks increasingly likely to follow suit. Actual football looks unlikely for a little while so, in the meantime, lose yourself in the underworld of meaningless tittle-tattle: A reminder England\u2019s tour of Sri Lanka has been canned: The GPs in Bahrain and Vietnam have also been cancelled: The Premier League are understood be meeting as we speak, with Aston Villa\u2019s chief executive, Christian Purslow, among those at the league\u2019s London headquarters. En route into the offices, Purslow said clubs would \u201cdo the right thing\u201d. We are expecting the Premier League and EFL to suspend matches until 4 April. At least seven top-flight clubs now have players in quarantine. With Bournemouth going into self-isolation mode, at least seven Premier League clubs are following government guidelines and Public Health England advice owing to symptoms of coronavirus: Arsenal, Bournemouth, Chelsea, Everton, Leicester, Manchester City and Watford. Meanwhile, a ludicrously minor footnote, but Aston Villa become the latest club to cancel their pre-match press conference; kudos to Steve Bruce and Nigel Pearson, who got one up on Boris Johnson, for braving it. Bournemouth goalkeeper Artur Boruc is one of five club employees currently self-isolating as a precaution, having displayed symptoms consistent with Covid-19. Boruc, along with four first-team members of staff, are self-isolating in line with government guidelines. None have tested positive for coronavirus. \u201cThe club continues to monitor the situation closely and to take suitable measures to ensure the wellbeing of its employees and supporters,\u201d reads a club statement. Away from football ... England\u2019s Test series in Sri Lanka has been cancelled, with all players sent home. \u201cDue to the Covid-19 pandemic worsening globally, and after discussions with Sri Lanka Cricket, we have today made the decision to return our players to the UK and postpone the forthcoming Test series between Sri Lanka and England,\u201d reads an ECB statement. More from Uefa, after confirmation that all of next week\u2019s European matches have been postponed owing to coronavirus: In the light of developments due to the spread of Covid-19 in Europe and related decisions made by different governments, all Uefa club competitions matches scheduled next week are postponed. This includes the remaining Uefa Champions League, round of 16 second leg matches scheduled on 17 and 18 March 2020; all Uefa Europa League, round of 16 second leg matches scheduled on 19 March 2020; all Uefa Youth League, quarter-final matches scheduled on 17 and 18 March 2020. Further decisions on when these matches take place will be communicated in due course. As a consequence of the postponements, the Uefa Champions League and Uefa Europa League quarter-final draws scheduled for 20 March have also been postponed. Uefa yesterday [Thursday] invited representatives of its 55 member associations, together with the boards of the European Club Association and the European Leagues and a representative of FifPro, to a videoconference meeting on Tuesday 17 March to discuss European football\u2019s response to the outbreak. West Brom are due to host Birmingham on Saturday lunchtime and, Charlie Austin for one, wants answers: All matches in Uefa competitions, including the Uefa Champions League and Uefa Europa League, will not take place next week. Unconfirmed reports that the Premier League and Football League will be suspended until April. The Daily Mail report that games in the English top flight and the EFL will be suspended until weekend of 4 April. They say an announcement is due around 11am. Meanwhile, all is seemingly rosy at Cheltenham: Watford\u2019s Nigel Pearson has been speaking sense this morning: We have to be mindful that this problem, this worldwide problem is not going to go away, it\u2019s going to run its course, it\u2019s not something we can stop and, we, in the football industry, have a responsibility to ourselves and each other that the wellbeing of everybody concerned is taken care. I think what\u2019s important first and foremost is to deal with the wellbeing of people involved in the industry. We have to be decisive with how the problem, the situation, is dealt with.\u201d More from Steve Bruce, who reckons the Premier League will, belatedly, agree to postpone matches. \u201cWe think it will be suspended \u2013 whether for two weeks, four weeks, we\u2019ll see,\u201d says the Newcastle manager. \u201cUp until [Thursday] we were pretty convinced it would go ahead, but obviously the situation has changed massively in the last 24 hours with players and managers getting it. I don\u2019t see any alternative now other than suspending it and seeing where we are in a few weeks.\u201d Nigel Pearson 1-0 Boris Johnson: I don\u2019t think we had any great leadership last night listening to the prime minister. I was totally underwhelmed by the lack of leadership and clear message in terms of what was said in that press conference. We are trying to be proactive ourselves and hopefully the Premier League will make strong decisions based on what is right for everybody in the game.\u201d Newcastle\u2019s manager, Steve Bruce, says the Premier League should shutdown until \u201cthe situation is clearer\u201d. Newcastle are due to play Sheffield United at 3pm GMT on Saturday and Bruce says none of his players nor staff have shown symptoms of coronavirus. \u201cTouch wood. The doctor has been in contact with the other doctors [in the Premier League] I believe and we\u2019re awaiting this phone call [about tomorrow\u2019s game]. We\u2019ve prepared for the game and people talk about it being behind closed doors but if we play it\u2019s for one thing \u2013 the supporters.\u201d Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 have been suspended until further notice, confirm the LFP, the Ligue de Football Professionnel. Watford cancelled training on Thursday because several members of the first-team squad felt unwell, with one player awaiting results of a test following symptoms associated with coronavirus, Nigel Pearson has confirmed. \u201cWe are talking about sport versus the well-being of people here,\u201d Pearson said on Friday morning. \u201cWe are trying to be proactive and hopefully the Premier League will make a strong decision based on what is good for everybody.\u201d The Bundesliga and 2. Bundesliga seasons will be suspended from Tuesday until 2 April, the DFL has confirmed. Oddly, however, this weekend\u2019s games will go ahead as planned behind closed doors, before the suspension formally begins. \u201cWith regard to possible scheduling flexibility, the DFL will communicate with DFB and Uefa to see if a delay of league matchdays until the end of May is theoretically possible,\u201d read a DFL statement. Everton have confirmed that, as a precautionary measure, their entire first-team squad and coaching staff are undertaking a period of self-isolation following medical advice after a first-team player reported symptoms consistent with coronavirus. As a result the club has closed Goodison Park, the club\u2019s training base at Finch Farm and its headquarters at the Royal Liver building in Liverpool. \u201cThe club is is in regular contact with the player in question and is monitoring the wellbeing of all players and staff,\u201d read a club statement on Friday morning. \u201cThe health, welfare and safety of all Everton players, staff and stakeholders is the club\u2019s absolute priority. Everton will continue to adhere to UK Government and Public Health guidelines with regards to the closure of its facilities and wellbeing of staff and will be discussing next steps with regards to upcoming fixtures with the Premier League on Friday morning. Further updates will be provided in due course, including guidance relating to forthcoming fixtures.\u201d Do get in touch, even if it is impossible to predict the future. \u201cJust a question concerning postponement of the league ... how does that affect final results, if, say, the league is stopped right now? Do these standings count as the final standings?\u201d asks Martin Segerstr\u00e5le. All of that is unclear at this stage but, hopefully, we will get clarification when the Premier League get their heads together. Should also clarify that, at the moment, the Premier League has not been postponed, delayed or suspended. But that\u2019s not to say things won\u2019t change ... The Peterborough United owner, Darragh MacAnthony, has confirmed the club has a player in self-isolation, and made it clear neither he nor Darren Ferguson wish to play this weekend\u2019s game. \u201cMy manager &amp; I agree btw does not want to travel to Bolton tomorrow,\u201d he said on Twitter. \u201cOne of our players is now in self isolation awaiting results. We just played Pompey who just played Arsenal. Will be reaching out to @EFL today re this &amp; if they are going to make us play tomorrow.\u201d That Premier League meeting, thought to be a video-conference call between all 20 clubs, is set to have significant implications on the landscape of the coming weeks and beyond. Eddie Howe is an early bird but Bournemouth have understandably delayed his press conference as they await further guidance from the league, pushing back his 9am press call until 1.30pm GMT. Steve Bruce, it says, here, is set to defy logic and speak at around 9.30am this morning. Things are getting in muddy in League One. Portsmouth insist Saturday\u2019s match with Accrington is yet to be postponed, but it seems a matter of time, with the club saying a further statement will be released later on Friday morning. Accrington had said a decision \u201cwas made in conjunction with Portsmouth after they confirmed that their players and staff will self-isolate for 14 days\u201d. But Pompey say otherwise at this stage. \u201cPortsmouth football club can confirm we are in discussions with the EFL, Accrington Stanley and medical experts. This comes after the news that Mikel Arteta, whose Arsenal side Pompey played in the FA Cup on 2 March, has tested positive for coronavirus. We would like to send our best wishes to Mikel and everyone at Arsenal, as well as anybody who has been affected by the outbreak.\u201d The Premier League is expected to convene at 10.30am GMT to determine what happens next. This is an unprecedented time but all 20 clubs will need to come to an unanimous decision for any action to be taken and government officials are also being kept in the loop. The EFL board are likely to follow action taken by the Premier League, who at 9.30pm on Thursday said all of this weekend\u2019s games would \u201cgo ahead as scheduled\u201d before, an hour later, releasing a statement confirming Friday morning\u2019s emergency meeting. In terms of press conferences, J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s has been canned, as has Frank Lampard\u2019s. Steve Bruce and Eddie Howe, however, are scheduled to speak as planned imminently. Portsmouth v Accrington Stanley has been postponed, with the League One clubs taking matters into their own hands after Mikel Arteta tested positive for Covid-19. \u201cThe decision to postpone tomorrow\u2019s [Saturday\u2019s] game was made in conjunction with Portsmouth after they confirmed that their players and staff will self-isolate for 14 days,\u201d read an Accrington statement on Friday morning. \u201cPortsmouth played Arsenal in the FA Cup at the beginning of the month and it was confirmed last night that Gunners manager Mikel Arteta has tested positive for coronavirus.\u201d On Thursday afternoon the prime minister said there was \u201cno medical reason\u201d to ban sporting events \u2013 but it seems increasingly unlikely that matches in the Premier League or the Football League will be played this weekend and yet, away from football, the final day of the Cheltenham Festival is set to go ahead on Friday as planned, with a crowd of around 60,000 expected despite the pandemic. \u201cWe are considering banning major public events like sporting fixtures,\u201d Boris Johnson said on Thursday. \u201cThe scientific advice is this has little effect on the spread - but it does place a burden on other public services. We are guided by the science; there is no medical reason at the moment to ban such events. We are not saying no to that sort of measure, we are keeping it up our sleeves. But it is very, very important in order to maximise our interventions that we get the timing right.\u201d A reminder that Euro 2020 could become Euro 2021: European football\u2019s governing body will meet stakeholders on Tuesday to discuss a series of proposals aimed at solving the growing disruption of the calendar due to Covid-19, with the prospect of Euro 2020 being delayed for a year among the options being considered. It is understood that all options are on the table at this stage, including the possibility that the format of the 24-team tournament could be altered or scrapping some of the 12 venues across the continent. Rome is due to host the opening match between Italy and Turkey on 12 June, with Wembley hosting seven matches including the final. \u2022 Premier League and EFL to meet to detail plan of action \u2022 Mikel Arteta and Callum Hudson-Odoi test positive for Covid-19 \u2022 Saturday\u2019s game between Arsenal and Brighton postponed \u2022 Chelsea and Arsenal playing and backroom staff self-isolating \u2022 Manchester City\u2019s Benjamin Mendy self-isolating \u2022 Three Leicester players have undergone tests for Covid-19 \u2022 Uefa to discuss possible Euro 2020 postponement on Tuesday \u2022 Serie A, La Liga, Eredivisie, Primeira Liga and MLS suspended \u2022 Golf\u2019s Players Championship cancelled \u2022 Australian GP called off The EFL has confirmed an emergency meeting will take place this morning \u201cto make a decision on this weekend\u2019s fixtures and beyond\u201d. It seems inevitable that football will shutdown on these shores, belatedly following in the footsteps of many European leagues. There will be no action in La Liga for \u201cat least the next two rounds of matches\u201d as a result of the quarantine of the Real Madrid squad, while the Netherlands\u2019 top two leagues have also been suspended for the same period. The EFL board and Premier League are both meeting this morning, hours after stating this weekend\u2019s action would go ahead as planned. Callum Hudson-Odoi says he is feeling fine and has recovered from coronavirus, but is self isolating, as per government advice. \u201cAs you may be aware I had the virus for the last couple of days, which I\u2019ve recovered from. I\u2019m following the health guidelines and self-isolating myself from everybody for the week. I hope to see everybody soon and hopefully be back on the pitch very soon.\u201d It probably shouldn\u2019t have taken a top-flight manager to contract coronavirus to prompt action, but that seems to be where we are at, with an emergency meeting planned between Premier League powers on Friday morning to determine the next step after news of Mikel Arteta\u2019s positive result. A few hours ago, Chelsea also announced their players are self-isolating after Callum Hudson-Odoi returned a positive test for the virus, while three Leicester players have also undergone tests for Covid-19 after experiencing symptoms. The outcome of that meeting, and the subsequent domino effect across the Football League and beyond, will inevitably dominate the discourse, but we will keep an eye on everything else too, though the football itself is trivial."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
