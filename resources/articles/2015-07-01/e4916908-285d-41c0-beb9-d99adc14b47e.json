Labor leads the Coalition 53% to 47% in two-party-preferred terms in the poll, published in the Australian. Labor\u2019s share is up one percentage point, while the Coalition\u2019s is down by the same margin from the last poll. The Coalition\u2019s primary vote is holding steady at 40%, while Labor\u2019s primary vote is up two percentage points to 39%. The popularity of the Greens and other minor parties have also fallen one point, to 12% and 9% respectively. Opposition leader Bill Shorten has emerged from the trade unions royal commission slightly diminished, his net satisfaction rating sitting at minus 32% to prime minister Tony Abbott\u2019s minus 27%. Just over a quarter of people surveyed, or 27%, were satisfied with Shorten\u2019s performance, compared with 59% who were dissatisfied, an overall drop of four percentage points. One-third of voters were satisfied with Abbott, compared with 60% who were dissatisfied, giving him the same overall satisfaction rating as last fortnight. Labor heads into this week\u2019s national conference with its two-party-preferred performance at a four-month high. The Coalition has failed to make significant headway in the polls since the May budget, its primary vote peaking at 41% in early June. The survey of 1,638 people took place over the weekend, and it has a margin of error of about 3%."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
