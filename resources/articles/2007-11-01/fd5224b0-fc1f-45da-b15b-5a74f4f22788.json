It was announced that Hossein Mousavian had been acquitted of espionage and possessing classified documents which he allegedly passed to the British embassy in Tehran. Mousavian, an ally of Ahmadinejad's main rival, Hashemi Rafsanjani, was convicted of a lesser charge of \"propaganda against the system\" and given a suspended sentence. The verdict has yet to be confirmed by Tehran's chief prosecutor. The president's spokesman, Gholamhossein Elham, hinted that the government might yet seek to reopen the case. Mousavian, who served as nuclear negotiator during the 1997-2005 reformist presidency of Mohammad Khatami, was detained for a week last spring before being freed on bail. The case became symbolic of a struggle for control over Iran's nuclear policy between Ahmadinejad, who refuses to suspend uranium enrichment, and pragmatists close to Rafsanjani who favour dealing with the west. Ahmadinejad intervened directly in the case against Mousavian two weeks ago by publicly labelling him a \"spy\" while accusing critics of the government's nuclear policy of being \"traitors\" who were colluding with western governments. Ahmadinejad said Mousavian's supporters were pressuring the judge to clear him, but said he would not escape \"justice\". Yesterday, Alireza Jamshidi, spokesman for the judiciary, appeared to condemn the comments. And the conservative newspaper Jomhouri Eslami, thought to have links to the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, last week denounced the president's attacks as \"immoral\" and said the courts should consider prosecution."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
