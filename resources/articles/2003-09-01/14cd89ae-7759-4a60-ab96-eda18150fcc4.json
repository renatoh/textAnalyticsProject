We have always assumed that the wine in the name stood for wine vinegar. But lately, I have begun to wonder if the early, 400-year-old Portuguese recipe did indeed use wine, albeit wine that had turned somewhat vinegary over its long passage in a rocking and rolling ship. The vinegar used these days is made from what Goans have the most of - rice or coconut palms. A vindaloo that may have started off as a simple stew acquired more and more Indian flavourings over time, and today even the name vindaloo stands for 'hot, hot, hot' the world over. In Goa, however, the heat is hardly its chief characteristic. It is the combination of spices - you can buy a mixed vindaloo masala in the bazaars - and the use of vinegar, which acts as a preservative, that makes vindaloos different from other Goan foods. Because of the preserving qualities of vinegar, vindaloos are considered a perfect wedding dish that, once made, may be served again and again over several days. All along the tropical southwestern coast of India I have found wedding and other banquet dishes that use souring agents - tamarinds, the kokum fruit and, of course, vinegar. These wedding foods (which can also be made with fish) are heated up daily to control the bacteria, but never see the inside of a refrigerator. While most vindaloos are made with pork, which Catholic Goans eat readily, they are also made with the ducks that paddle freely in the thousands of flooded rice fields. The dish then becomes accessible to the many Muslims and Hindus of the area. The ducks that I get are the Peking variety, usually weighing anywhere between 2-3.2kg and, unlike chickens, are long-breasted. I used a 2.7kg duck here. It is best to ask the butcher to joint it for you, cutting the bird into serving pieces. The legs should be detached and divided into two pieces each and the breast area cut neatly into four sections, once across and once lengthways. The wings should be separated as well. They have very little meat, but I tend to cook them along with the rest of the duck, as they add flavour to the sauce. In India, the bird is usually skinned. What I do - and this I do myself - is to cut off all the hanging flaps of fat and skin but leave some skin on each piece. I always cook the duck a day in advance. It not only tastes better but also allows me to remove most of the fat that congeals at the top. And yes, I do refrigerate it. Duck vindaloo Vindaloos are invariably served with rice in India, but I often enjoy serving them with boiled, browned potatoes and any strong, slightly bitter greens such as saut\u00e9ed endive. Serves 6. 1/2 tsp ground turmeric 1 tbsp ground cumin 1 tbsp bright red paprika 1 tbsp ground coriander 1 tsp cayenne pepper 1 1/2 tsp garam masala 4 tbsp corn or peanut oil 1 x 2.7kg duck, jointed and partially skinned 1/2 tsp whole brown mustard seeds 1/2 tsp whole fenugreek seeds 15 fresh curry leaves, if available 2 medium onions, about 285g, peeled and sliced into fine half-rings 2 tbsp peeled and finely grated fresh ginger 10 medium cloves garlic, peeled and crushed to a pulp 2 medium tomatoes, peeled and chopped 120ml cider vinegar 2 tsp salt 1 tbsp sugar Mix together the turmeric, cumin, paprika, coriander, cayenne pepper and garam masala in a small bowl and set aside. Pour the oil into a large, wide, lidded pan and set over a medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, put in as many duck pieces, skin side down, as the pan will hold easily in a single layer. Lightly brown the duck, about 3-4 minutes per side, and remove to a bowl. Brown all the duck pieces this way and remove. Add the mustard and fenugreek seeds to the hot fat and, as soon as the mustard seeds start to pop, which will happen in a matter of seconds, put in the curry leaves and onions. Stir and fry them until the onions begin to turn brown at the edges. Now put in the ginger and garlic. Stir and fry for a minute. Add the mixed spices from the small bowl and stir for 30 seconds. Add the tomatoes and cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring, until they have softened. Scrape the bottom of the pan as you do this. Now add the browned duck pieces, the vinegar, salt, sugar and 475ml water. Stir and bring to the boil. Cover, reduce the heat to low, and cook gently for 45 minutes, lifting the lid occasionally to stir. Increase the heat to medium-low and simmer, partially covered, a bit more vigorously, stirring more frequently, for a further 30 minutes or until the duck is tender and the sauce has thickened slightly. Remove as much fat as possible before serving. Walnut and mint chutney A wonderful fresh chutney from northwestern Pakistan that may be served with all manner of kebabs and, indeed, with all Indian meals. The usual souring agent in this chutney is anardana - dried, sour pomegranate seeds taken from fruit that grow as abundantly in this region as the walnuts that this recipe also demands. I have had little luck with anardana in the West. I can buy it all right, but the seeds are dark and unyielding, nothing like the soft brown, melting seeds found in Pakistan or, indeed, in the villages of Indian Punjab. Instead I resort to lemon juice. Serves 8. 30g fresh mint leaves, well washed and coarsely chopped 60g shelled walnuts 1 clove garlic, peeled and crushed to a pulp 4-5 fresh, hot green chillies (such as bird's-eye chillies or any of the cayenne type of chilli), sliced 1 tbsp lemon juice or to taste 1/2 tsp salt 4 tbsp natural yoghurt Put the mint leaves, walnuts, garlic, chillies, lemon juice, salt and 5 tbsp water into a blender and blend, pushing down with a rubber spatula when needed, until you have a smooth paste. Put the yoghurt into a bowl. Beat lightly with a fork until smooth and creamy. Add the paste from the blender and mix. Taste for a balance of seasonings, making any adjustments that are needed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
