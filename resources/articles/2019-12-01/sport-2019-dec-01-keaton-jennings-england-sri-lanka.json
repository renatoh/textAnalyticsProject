The 27-year-old has not played for England since a consolation victory over West Indies at St Lucia in February, when his struggle against the new ball on seaming pitches left him with an average of 25 from 17 Tests. This figure is a more healthy 44 on the subcontinent thanks to a proficiency against spin, the opener making 112 on debut against India in 2016 and an unbeaten 146 in Galle during England\u2019s 3-0 series win last year. England are minded to repeat as much as they can from that trip, with World Test Championship points on the line when they return to Galle and Colombo, giving Jennings a chance to be reunited with Rory Burns in a short-term move. Ben Foakes, whose impeccable glovework was another factor in the 2018 success (along with a century on debut), is another who will come into consideration even if he misses out as the back-up wicketkeeper for the next tour to South Africa. Jennings is notably the only capped batsman among the five taking part in an England spin training camp in Mumbai, with Will Jacks, Sam Hain, James Bracey and Dan Lawrence, who are all deemed long-term prospects. The three-week trip, which runs until 17 December and also features the bowlers Dom Bess, Mason Crane and Amar Virdi, includes sessions with Sri Lanka\u2019s now retired Rangana Herath, the all-time leading left-arm spinner with 433 Test wickets . Ed Smith, the national selector, is also in attendance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
