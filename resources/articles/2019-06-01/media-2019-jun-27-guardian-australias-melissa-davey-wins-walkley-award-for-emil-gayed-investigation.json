Davey revealed the Taree-based regional New South Wales doctor needlessly removed women\u2019s reproductive organs and performed unnecessary surgeries on his patients. Other women were allegedly left with life-threatening infections. One of his patients died. A year after \u201cThe investigation into Dr Gayed\u201d story was published detectives from the NSW police child abuse and sex crimes squad launched a strike force to investigate Gayed and his scores of alleged victims. The award \u201chonours women who are making an outstanding journalistic contribution to gender equality and the visibility of women in society \u2013 both in Australia and on a global scale\u201d. \u201cIt celebrates reporting that demonstrates notable innovation, enterprise or courage in raising awareness of women\u2019s experiences and perspectives, and reflects the significance of media coverage in altering perceptions, challenging stereotypes and fighting misinformation,\u201d the foundation said at the ceremony in Sydney on Wednesday. The revelations also triggered the NSW government to order an independent inquiry into Gayed, the hospitals where he worked and the way complaints against him were managed. The inquiry was led by the high-profile lawyer Gail Furness SC, who delivered her findings in February. Furness also referred the treatment of more than 50 women to the Health Care Complaints Commission for further investigation and, in a rare move, handed her report over to NSW police. She found his actions may have contributed to the death of a baby boy. The other Walkley nominees in the category were Lorna Knowles, Jo Puccini and Alison McClymont for their ABC report on #MeToo in the Australian Greens, and News Corp\u2019s Sherele Moody for \u201cWho.
