But as she and Toronto learned on Thursday night: unlikely doesn\u2019t mean never. Following a nailbiting win by the Toronto Raptors over the Golden State Warriors in Oakland, she found herself dressed as a purple dinosaur, running up and down the streets and weaving through traffic at 1am on Friday as cars honked and strangers cheered her. \u201cThis is unbelievable. It\u2019s so much fun,\u201d said MacKeigan. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen so many people from all walks of life in the happiest mood they\u2019ve ever been in. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d After nearly 25 years of ambition marred by disappointment and frustration, the Toronto Raptors have brought the city \u2013 and country \u2013 its first-ever NBA championship. As Game 6 of the NBA finals ended and the team hoisted the coveted Larry O\u2019Brien trophy, tens of thousands of Toronto residents poured into the streets, converting busy thoroughfares and city squares into temples of celebration. Fans in the city\u2019s downtown core scaled anything they could \u2013 including buses, buildings and traffic lights \u2013 as car horns blared and the night was lit up by fireworks. Police blocked off major roads to allow fans to celebrate until the early hours of Friday. \u201cThis is an amazing crowd and such an amazing night,\u201d said Alex Zdravkovic, a bartender. \u201cThis means everything to the city. Everything.\u201d The win ended what many consider a 26-year drought of major sports championships for the city \u2013 the last of which was a 1993 baseball World Series win for the Blue Jays. Despite more recent titles for the city\u2019s soccer, rugby and Canadian Football League teams, nothing has enraptured Toronto quite like the Raptors\u2019 run to the NBA finals. \u201cYou have fans that have been around for 24 years and you have fans that have been around for two weeks. Everyone\u2019s coming together and they\u2019re having a good time. That\u2019s all that really matters,\u201d said Sara MacLennan-Nobrega, a self-identified \u2018bandwagon fan\u2019. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re new \u2013 you\u2019re here to support the team. And that\u2019s about it.\u201d Nearly a full day before the tipoff in Oakland, supporters began gathering in Jurassic Park, the team\u2019s official fan area, to take in the game on a giant screen outside the Raptors home arena. Praised by basketball commentators for their unwavering dedication to the team, fans braved heavy downpours \u2013 enough to briefly flood parts of the city \u2013 to witness what many hoped would be a franchise first. Much of what fuelled the energy was a belief that Toronto had been unjustly overlooked by analysts and the broader basketball community. Even though the Raptors methodically dispatched elite teams one-by-one, the cognoscenti of the NBA had Golden State, the reigning champions, as the favourites. \u201cWe\u2019ve been a serious [team] for a while now,\u201d said MacLennan-Nobrega. \u201cBut this just shows the rest of the world: Toronto\u2019s here and we\u2019re going to kill it.\u201d For some, the win is a chance to revel in the narrative of underdog-turned-victor, for both the franchise and the city. \u201cThis puts us on the map. I feel like we were never really respected as a sports town before this. And now we\u2019re No 1,\u201d said Rory Cohen. A fan since the franchise first came into existence in 1995, he readily admits he would have bet on Golden State to win in any other year. \u201cThis is one of the best feeling in my life.\u201d Supendra Chandrakumar, who travels the world with his \u2018We The North\u2019 flag, grew up with his father regaling him with tales of the city\u2019s last major sports championship, the 1993 Blue Jays win. \u201cTo be able to witness this, right at the front of our doorstep, is something truly remarkable,\u201d he said. Chandrakumar is also moved by the way in which the Raptors have become Canada\u2019s team, with their red-and-white jerseys reflecting a fanbase that extends far beyond the boundaries of Toronto. \u201cWhether you\u2019re from Halifax or Vancouver Island ... being able to be from so many parts of our nation and to take this in, it\u2019s really truly remarkable,\u201d he said. The Raptors\u2019 run through the playoffs has thawed the rivalry between Toronto and Vancouver, which doesn\u2019t have an NBA team of its own. It has also helped to bridge Canada\u2019s often fractious east-west divide. For Game 6, there were 59 \u2018Jurassic Park\u2019 viewing areas set up across the country, including parks, movie theatres and entire football stadiums. \u201cAll throughout the playoffs, the energy ... kept getting stronger from when we first made [the finals], to even when we lost [Games 2 and 5]. I feel that everyone\u2019s just been so positive,\u201d said Mark Browne, a lifelong Toronto resident. \u201cI can tell my kids, when they get older, that I was around and witnessed history.\u201d For his brother Eric, the feeling is simple: \u201cWe used to be \u2018The North\u2019. But now, we\u2019re the best.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
