Early summer is when the flowers of Bell\u2019s Grooves, a tiny open valley in the North Pennines, are at their most vivid. This local wildlife site is just half a kilometre long, a narrow strip, a remnant of lead mining, on either side of the East Allen as it flows out of Allenheads. This worked land is a complex patchwork of soils and habitats for niche plants to grow, light-filled except where a few trees \u2013 willow, hawthorn and rowan \u2013 dot the terraces and mounds of spoil. By the roadside the grass is long and the breeze tugs at the fluffy white tops of sweet cicely; I crumple one of its ferny leaves to inhale the aniseed scent. There are wide acid-green pools of crosswort mixed with the flashy pink of red campion and violet blue patches of wood cranesbill. A few paces from this lushness the ground suddenly changes, the turf barely an inch high and spread with thousands of mountain pansies. Mostly in shades of purple, there are just a few that have the clear yellow petals that give its botanical name of Viola lutea. Among the pansies are the tiny five-petalled stars of spring sandwort, Minuartia verna. Both are metallophyte plants, tolerant of this area\u2019s high levels of heavy metals such as lead and zinc. The ground changes again by the riverbank where golden cups of marsh marigold shine in the wet places and monkey flower and water mint grow in the shallows. Strong posts hold back bundles of brash to support the bank during annual floods. I lift a piece of sheeting, hoping to see an adder, and find a crouching pale brown toad. Swallows chatter as they skim low over meadowsweet, ladies mantle and pale pink ladies smock. Meadow pipits cry seep seep and a sandpiper picks its way among the rocks. I sit where the river drops into a sloping weir, beautifully paved with rectangular stones, and watch a dipper bobbing in alarm, its beak full and bristling with insects. And there among the boulders are three newly fledged dippers, bob-bobbing and demanding to be fed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
