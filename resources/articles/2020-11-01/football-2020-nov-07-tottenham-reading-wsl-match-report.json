Morgan came off the bench as Spurs drew 1-1 against Reading to claim their first ever point off Reading and only their second of the season. \u201cWhy not?\u201d said Amoros. \u201cI want to have her in my team for ever. At the moment she is our player and hopefully she stays with us for a very, very long time because she\u2019s one of the best professionals and best people I\u2019ve ever coached.\u201d The US forward, seven months after the birth of her daughter, Charlie, entered the fray in the 69th minute with the match finely poised at 1-1 but struggled to assert herself as the visiting team pressed for a winner. However, just being on the pitch will be extremely welcome with speculation rife on whether she would even make an appearance before the option of a return to the US in the new year. \u201cIt was one of those games that it\u2019s difficult to get into and find your feet but I think she\u2019s done well,\u201d said Amoros. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about Alex scoring the winner but the main thing is that we all can enjoy her being back on a football pitch.\u201d The arrival of the 31-year-old has also heaped pressure on Tottenham, in ways that the club could perhaps not have envisaged. The global superstar brings a following that, online at least, dwarfs her new club\u2019s. The overwhelming majority will not be familiar with Spurs\u2019 recent journey from the bottom to the top of women\u2019s football. Their expectations are not tempered by the knowledge that this is only the club\u2019s second season at this level, or that Saturday\u2019s opponents Reading are far more established in the top division. Instead, they see one of the biggest players in the world at one of the sport\u2019s best-known clubs. Reading, though, ooze experience and a line-splitting pass from the Wales international Jess Fishlock found Emma Mitchell on the left and her cross was headed in by Brooke Chaplen to give the visitors the lead. Tottenham equalised shortly afterwards when a corner from the Dutch defender Siri Worm was eventually flicked over the goalkeeper Grace Moloney by Ashleigh Neville. With Morgan\u2019s recruitment at one end of the spectrum, the progress of the right-back Neville \u2013 who has helped Spurs climb from the third tier to the WSL in three years \u2013 and the introduction of the 19-year-old Elisha Sulola speaks to the other side of the managers\u2019 strategy. \u201cThat\u2019s what we want to do,\u201d said Amoros. \u201cHave the best players in the world together with players that we develop, local talent, and today was a prime example of that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
