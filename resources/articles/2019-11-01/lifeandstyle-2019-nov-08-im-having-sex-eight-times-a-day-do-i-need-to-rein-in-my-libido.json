After a virtually sexless marriage, I recently started seeing someone who has turned out to be an amazing lover. So far so good, except sex has taken over my life. He lives at the other end of the country, which means we can spend only every other week together, but when we do, we\u2019ll have sex as many as seven or eight times a day. He is in his 50s, too, and I really don\u2019t know how he does it \u2013 there\u2019s no Viagra involved. But I have no complaints. Should I just go with it or try to get my mania for sex under some sort of control? \u2022 When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Private Lives asking for help, and may well view your comments here.
