Speaking in a historically charged venue, the First Congregational Church of Atlanta, one of the oldest African American churches in the US founded in 1867 by freed slaves, the California senator gave a blunt account of the problems facing the nation. \u201cRacism is real in this country,\u201d she said, \u201csexism is real in this country, homophobia is real \u2026 antisemitism is real.\u201d She also lamented what she called a \u201csystematic attempt to suppress the vote in America\u201d, citing court rulings that found that \u201cthey\u201d \u2013 a clear though implicit reference to Republicans \u2013 \u201ctarget African Americans with almost surgical precision\u201d. Harris, who in January took up the US Senate seat vacated by Barbara Boxer, went on to criticise the vilification and scapegoating of undocumented migrants, the plight of Puerto Ricans in the wake of Hurricane Maria, and the move by the US attorney general, Jeff Sessions, to \u201cre-escalate the failed war on drugs\u201d. But she also made a strong bid to reclaim the concept of patriotism and love of country for the progressive movement. Though she did not mention Trump by name, she invoked the president when she said that \u201cthere are forces of hate and division trying to tear us apart\u201d. \u201cAmericans have so much more in common than what separates us,\u201d she said. Her kind of patriotism, Harris said, was to believe in the country\u2019s ideals and fight for them. \u201cWhen we fight for the ideals behind the constitution of the United States,\u201d she said, \u201cthat is the very definition of being a patriot.\u201d Again, Harris did not refer directly to the ongoing spat between Trump and NFL players who have been protesting racial injustice by kneeling during the national anthem. But her purpose was plain. \u201cWhen we sing The Star-Spangled Banner, we rightly think of brave men and women who defend the freedom of those they may never meet \u2026 We also think about those marching in the streets who demand the ideals of that flag represent them too.\u201d Harris, 52, began her eye-catching career in public service as a prosecutor, working as district attorney of San Francisco and then attorney general of California from 2010. In eight months in the Senate she has made a mark. Playing to the left, she backed Bernie Sanders in his plan for \u201cMedicare for all\u201d healthcare reform. Forging bipartisan credentials, she teamed up with the Kentucky Republican senator Rand Paul to introduce legislation to help people put behind bars because they cannot afford bail. The First Congregational Church has a long history of hosting sermons and addresses by prominent black leaders. Booker T Washington, a leader of former slaves in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, spoke there. In recent years, Calvin Butts and Bernice King, the youngest child of Martin Luther King, have spoken at the church."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
