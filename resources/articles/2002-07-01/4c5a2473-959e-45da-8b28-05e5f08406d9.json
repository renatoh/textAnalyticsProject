Hinshelwood, who first arrived at the Seagulls in 1987, succeeds the former England assistant coach Peter Taylor, who stunned the club by quitting two weeks after leading them to the Second Division title in May. But Hinshelwood's appointment was almost overshadowed as the chairman Dick Knight revealed he had interviewed and turned down a World Cup manager - strongly rumoured to be the Cameroon coach Winfried Sch\u00e4fer. Bristol City's Danny Wilson, the Arsenal centre-back Tony Adams and the former Brentford manager Steve Coppell had all been linked with the job. Juninho was last night mulling over a fresh offer to return to the Premiership after Middlesbrough stepped up their bid for his signature.

We are hopeful that both parties can eventually agree a deal to bring Juninho back to Middlesbrough.\" Aston Villa face a tough task to qualify for the Uefa Cup following yesterday's Intertoto Cup semi-final and final draw. Villa, favourites to win a third-round tie against Swiss side FC Zurich, would then meet Lille in the semi-finals if the French side overcome Romania's Gloria Bistrita. Victory for Graham Taylor's side would then pit them against either Germany's Stuttgart, Perugia of Italy, Bulgaria's Marek Dupnitsa or Slaven Belupo of Croatia in a final. Fulham can earn a semi-final spot if they overcome Aegaleo from Greece in round three. There they would meet either the Czech side FC Synot or Sochaux of France. Jean Tigana's men would then face Serie A's Bologna, BATE Borisov of Belarus, FC Teplice from the Czech Republic or Germany's Kaiserslautern should they reach the final tie. Bolton are set to come face to face with Ronaldo after securing a pre-season clash with Internazionale as part of the club's three-match tour of Italy. The Portsmouth manager Harry Redknapp yesterday flew to France to discuss personal terms with David Ginola after being given the go-ahead to match the French winger's wage demands.
