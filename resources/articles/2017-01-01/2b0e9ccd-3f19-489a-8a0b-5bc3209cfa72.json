In the buildup to the match the Frenchman said how his players \u201chad nothing to lose\u201d and it was time for his team to back him up amid growing frustration at his defensive approach and his side\u2019s poor form. His team did just that, laying down a marker albeit without any real swagger, as Southampton became just the third team to beat Liverpool this season. Just two days earlier the Southampton manager batted away questions about his team being boring to watch. For Puel, it felt like a momentous evening even before a ball was kicked. There was no cup fever and tickets were still on sale within a couple of hours of kick-off. Puel has been forced to explain his rigid rotation policy but he made the right call here, playing the strongest team available to him, although his captain, Jos\u00e9 Fonte, was omitted from the squad altogether after requesting a transfer. It took Southampton an age to get out of first gear but once the wheels were in motion they made Liverpool look rather ordinary and soon dispelled the bad energies surrounding St Mary\u2019s, with a much-needed win on home turf. And in the end it was one of Puel\u2019s most entrusted players, Nathan Redmond, who silenced the doubters. Redmond had become the scapegoat of Southampton supporters\u2019 frustrations, with the winger-cum-forward guilty of recent profligacy in front of goal. Redmond played wide here, in his best position, and could have had a hat-trick but for Loris Karius, the much-maligned Liverpool goalkeeper. Redmond excelled under the lights and in the second half played his part in what should have been the goal that put Saints out of sight, only for C\u00e9dric Soares to fire against the side netting. Redmond knows the feeling. Virgil van Dijk led from the back, while Oriol Romeu and Ryan Bertrand, two of Southampton\u2019s most consistent performers this campaign, grew into the match. This was Southampton\u2019s first of six matches in 20 days but Puel had to go for broke or risk further discontent from the stands, with supporters still adapting to the Frenchman\u2019s style after the high\u2013octane approaches of Mauricio Pochettino and Ronald Koeman. For the opening 20 minutes, the hosts were second best and made to watch Liverpool control possession. Dusan Tadic, with a razor-sharp mohican, was too slow to react while Jordy Clasie was left chasing shadows. J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team were comfortable in exhibition mode but unfortunately for Southampton, the fluorescent lime green shirts were not bibs but rather Liverpool, playing in their third kit. But Southampton then reduced Liverpool to making bitty fouls and, just as when they played out a stalemate here in November, the visitors struggled to penetrate the Saints\u2019 back line. Lucas Leiva passed the ball waywardly out of play and James Milner suddenly looked uncomfortable at left-back. Romeu was outstanding in midfield, continuously harassing Emre Can, and Clasie stood up to Daniel Sturridge, pinching the ball off the England striker at a critical moment. Then there was Van Dijk, impressive in defence and attack, making a foray into the Liverpool penalty area before stinging the palms of Karius. It was Bertrand\u2019s galloping run into the opposition half, seemingly bringing the Saints supporters with him, that saw Southampton come alive. Then the impetus from Redmond\u2019s goal gave them the lift they had been looking for after three straight Premier League defeats and an FA Cup draw at Norwich City on Saturday. After the match Puel was delighted with the clean sheet and how priceless the one-goal advantage may yet prove at Anfield in a fortnight\u2019s time. The challenge for his team now is to replicate the same level of performance on a regular basis, starting at Turf Moor on Saturday. \u201cNow it\u2019s important to show this level in all of our games in the Premier League and it\u2019s important people understand we can do this game in the league,\u201d Puel said. Five Southampton players have swapped St Mary\u2019s for Anfield in recent times, the most recent being Sadio Man\u00e9, and it\u2019s plain to see why there\u2019s a fear that Van Dijk will eventually join Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren et al on Merseyside. The Dutchman marshalled Sturridge, who has had so much joy at St Mary\u2019s of late, impeccably. Maya Yoshida, too, the Japanese defender who partnered Van Dijk, will have won plaudits. Klopp summoned Divock Origi and the returning Philippe Coutinho \u2013 much to the anguish of the home supporters \u2013 but Southampton stood firm to take away a character-building victory. Puel lacks charisma and is quietly spoken but his slow and steady approach has given Southampton a good footing for the second leg and the possibility of reaching a Wembley final is \u2013 from nowhere \u2013 all the more palpable. There were jitters \u2013 nobody will have felt them more than the manager \u2013 but Southampton, as the saying goes, marched on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
