According to the New York Times, Barnes died aged 78 \u2013 or possibly 79 \u2013 in 2012. The news was not known until now, the newspaper said, because Barnes had entered the federal witness protection program. The Guardian could not independently confirm the report. The report of Barnes\u2019 death came a week after the death at 88 of Frank Lucas, a rival Harlem heroin kingpin of the same era who was was the lead character in the 2007 film, played by Denzel Washington. American Gangster also starred Russell Crowe as a cop. Put on trial in 1977, Barnes was convicted and sent to prison for life without parole. As it turned out, he spent more than 20 years behind bars. While in jail, the Times said, Barnes became so incensed that his former associates were ruining his drug empire that he decided to testify against them. Following his release in 1998, federal authorities put him in witness protection, under a new name. Around the release of American Gangster, Barnes participated in a biography and documentary and gave the Times an interview. He said he resented Scott\u2019s film for the way it focused on Lucas rather than him. But he also said he had abandoned his old, flashy ways. \u201cNicky Barnes is not around anymore,\u201d he said. \u201cNicky Barnes\u2019s lifestyle and his value system is extinct \u2026 I left Nicky Barnes behind.\u201d In Barnes\u2019 heyday, the Times said, he owned \u201cas many as 200 suits, 100 pairs of custom-made shoes, 50 full-length leather coats, a fleet of luxury cars and multiple homes and apartments\u201d. The drug trade that made him him a millionaire had a drastic effect on African American neighborhoods but Barnes managed to cast himself as a sort of Robin Hood in Harlem, through stunts such as passing out holiday turkeys, something Washington\u2019s Lucas is shown doing in the movie. Prior to his conviction, a sharply besuited Barnes even appeared on the cover of the New York Times Magazine under the headline \u201cMr Untouchable\u201d and with the caption: \u201cThe Police Say He May Be Harlem\u2019s Biggest Drug Dealer. But Can They Prove It?\u201d The story offended then US president Jimmy Carter so much, the Times said, that he ordered Barnes prosecuted \u201cto the fullest extent of the law\u201d. After Barnes\u2019 release, he seemed to crave normality. \u201cThe anonymity that cloaks Middle America,\u201d he told the Times in 2007, \u201cis the life I\u2019m comfortable with, and what I want to be.\u201d Under his new identity, in an undisclosed location, Barnes reportedly ran automatic carwashes. The sketchiest thing he seemed to peddle was \u201csomething called a flake-burger, made from remnants of butchered beef\u201d. \u201cI want to get up every day and get in the car and go to work and be a respected member of my community,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cAnd I am respected. \u201cI\u2019m not looking in the rear-view mirror to see if anyone is tailing me any more. I don\u2019t turn on the blender when I\u2019m at home so I can talk. That is not a part of my life. Sure, I\u2019d love to have more money, but I am not willing to do anything but go to my job to get it.\u201d Barnes sank back into anonymity. After more than a decade and spurred by the death of Lucas, the Times came looking again. It confirmed this week that he died of cancer in 2012. Informed of Barnes\u2019 death, Robert Fiske Jr, who was Manhattan US attorney in 1977, told the Times Barnes had run \u201cthe largest, the most profitable and the most venal drug ring in New York\u201d. At his trial, Barnes denied killing anyone himself, saying he only gave orders. The authorities argued otherwise. One of Barnes\u2019 daughters told the Times in an email the family had decided not to publicize his death, writing: \u201cIt still remains a sensitive topic given all that occurred. Our dad was very private and we wanted to respect that.\u201d The daughter also said that she and her sister might write a memoir \u201cabout growing up as the daughters of a notorious criminal\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
