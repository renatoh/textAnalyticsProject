With Gordon Brown's 11th budget less than a fortnight away, the Bank's monetary policy committee decided against the quarter-point increase in borrowing costs predicted by a minority of City analysts. The 1.8% increase in house prices reported by the Halifax yesterday left businesses convinced that the Bank had offered only a temporary reprieve and that it would drop its \"wait-and-see\" approach over the coming months. \"This looks more like a temporary respite than a reprieve,\" said Graeme Leach of the Institute of Directors. \"Recent stock market turbulence has played its part in today's decision but we still think a further quarter-point interest rate rise is likely next month.\" Roger Bootle, economic adviser to Deloitte, said: \"Rates are still likely to rise again. And there remains a chance that they will eventually have to rise above 5.5%. The case for higher interest rates remains strikingly clear, with significant upside risks to inflation stemming from a number of sources.\" The MPC has raised rates three times since last August, most recently in January, and has warned that one further quarter-point increase will be needed to be sure of hitting Mr Brown's 2% inflation target in two years' time. Two committee members - Andrew Sentance and Tim Besley - voted for a tougher monetary stance last month. There was also speculation in the City last night that yesterday's decision might also have been a close-run thing. Many economists believe that the likeliest time for the next rate increase is May, when Threadneedle Street's economists compile their quarterly analysis of the prospects for growth and inflation. Recent data on the economy has painted a mixed picture, with the government's preferred measure of inflation falling back from 3% to 2.7% but evidence that businesses are exploiting strong demand by pushing up prices. The Bank is monitoring developments in the labour market and is anxious that last year's rise in inflation should not trigger higher pay awards in 2007. Early evidence suggests that pay deals are slightly up on 2006, with Incomes Data Services reporting that median settlements rose to 3.5% in January compared to 3% in most of 2006. CBI chief economic adviser Ian McCafferty said: \"Indications of restraint in the private sector pay round, combined with the government's welcome curb on public sector pay, will be helping allay inflation concerns. Against this in the MPC's considerations will have been rising prices on the high street and at factory gates. \"The recent jitters across financial markets have added to the uncertainty and until the economic impact of the budget is clear, the Bank's decision to keep rates stable makes sense.\" Although it reported that the annual rate of house-price inflation remained unchanged at 9.9% last month, the Halifax said there were signs of a \"modest slowdown in activity\". In the three months to February, prices rose by 2.3% compared with 4.7% in the previous quarter, while buyer inquiries weakened in the new year. The Halifax warned, however, that the housing market remained very tight. \"Low supply - both in terms of new housebuilding and secondhand properties for sale - is continuing to exert upward pressure on house prices, particularly in London.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
