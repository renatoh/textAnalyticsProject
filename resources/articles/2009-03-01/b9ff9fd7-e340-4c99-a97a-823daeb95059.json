Such is the debate over Hillary: The Movie. This week the supreme court will decide if the film deserves the protection of free speech granted by the first amendment of the US constitution or if it should be subjected to campaign finance laws. The president of Citizens United (the conservative group that funded the film), David Bossie, was a former congressional aide and is a longtime critic of Bill and Hillary Clinton. The movie, which was released during the presidential primary season, includes commentary from pundits such as Ann Coulter and Newt Gingrich, as well as US News &amp; World Report and New York Times reporters.
