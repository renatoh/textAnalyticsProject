In the most serious, which occurred before the England v Ireland match, stewards and police were caught unawares by a bottleneck of supporters at the north-east corner of the ground. Supporters reported being lifted off their feet in the overcrowding and the situation was so serious police ordered emergency exit gates be opened to relieve the pressure. The stadium director Richard Knight believes a late walk-up of fans who had watched big screen coverage of Wales v France was responsible because it finished only 17 minutes before kick-off. At a safety review meeting later this month attended by police and local authority officials responsible for granting a safety licence, Knight will argue that the staggered kick-off times be changed. Such a move could cause conflict with the BBC, which favours running matches back-to-back. \"We are aware of the incidents and we are looking at how to avoid them in future,\" Knight said. \"One of the issues is when games kick-off, and I don't think it's wise for the fixtures to be scheduled in the same way again.\" Coe U-turn over stadium Seb Coe executed a significant U-turn yesterday on the opening day of a three-day visit by International Olympic Committee inspectors. Coe, far right, confirmed that West Ham may be approached to take over the tenancy of the Olympic Stadium after the games, going back on repeated pledges that a football club would not be accommodated in Stratford. During the bid London sought the votes of the athletics fraternity within IOC membership by insisting the stadium would be a dedicated athletics venue. In 2004 Ken Livingstone, right, was even more explicit, telling a Labour conference fringe meeting: \"Unfortunately West Ham will not get the stadium.\" Faced with the reality of funding the stadium, however, the position has shifted, with Coe saying a football club could be accommodated but only if the stadium remains fit for athletics. If the prospect of a football stadium with a secondary athletics facility rings a bell, it should: one of the first stumbling blocks in the Wembley saga was over just such an issue. Fan power sways Boro Middlesbrough caved in to supporter pressure last night, reversing an earlier decision to stop fans from buying tickets online for Sunday's FA Cup semi-final at Villa Park. London-based supporters who had already planned to travel were dismayed yesterday morning to find the club had backtracked after saying tickets could be bought online or over the phone. Sales were to be restricted to fans who went to the Riverside in person. Someone, however, evidently pointed out attendances on Teesside have been erratic this season and alienating more fans was hardly a good move. Fifa tackled over tickets Fifa is braced for a barrage of up to one million emails protesting at the allocation of 40% of World Cup tickets to sponsors, corporate guests and supporters of non-competing nations. The Football Supporters' Federation has launched an online petition (www.footballsupportersinternational. com) calling on Fifa to redress the balance. For every signatory the site automatically emails Fifa. It hopes to collect one million or one for every ticket directed away from fans. Sponsors (21%) receive the largest block of tickets at matches, more even than the competing nations whose fans receive only 16% in any ground between them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
