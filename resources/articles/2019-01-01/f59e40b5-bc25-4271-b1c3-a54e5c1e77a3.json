The 17-year-old striker\u2019s 82nd minute introduction in Sydney FC\u2019s 3-0 win over Western Sydney Wanderers at Leichhardt Oval was just reward for a player who has developed a reputation among her teammates as a \u201cfighter\u201d with a fierce competitive streak. \u201cI think back home, competing against the boys, I reckon it comes from that,\u201d she tells Guardian Australia. \u201cThe boys up there are pretty rough with everyone and I reckon I just thought, if they give me a push why not give them a push back. But I\u2019ve always been competitive and rough and tough. When I\u2019m training, in the games. Even going out hunting and stuff, chasing goannas, things like that, I always want to give it my best.\u201d Born and raised in the remote town of Borroloola on the Northern Territory\u2019s east coast, Evans was 13 when she moved 3,000km to Sydney as a graduate of the John Moriarty Football program for Indigenous players from the Top End. Since becoming involved with the foundation Evans, who started playing barefoot with her uncle and cousins at the age of nine, has been making giant leaps. Moriarty was the first Indigenous player to be selected for Australia in 1961, and was also born in Borroloola. He has been running the program since 2012, and Evans is the first professional athlete to emerge from it. In 2015 she moved to Sydney and enrolled at Westfields Sports High, as part of the school\u2019s football program. \u201cIt was very difficult at first, being 13, it was very young to move away from home by myself but I found it easier because I had a very supportive family, great coaches and the John Moriarty foundation,\u201d she says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be where I am without them, really.\u201d Moriarty himself is sure Thursday night was just the beginning for his star graduate. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely her dream [to play for the Matildas] and the fact she\u2019s already played for the Young Matildas, she certainly has her sights firmly set on that,\u201d he says. \u201cAs far as we\u2019re concerned she certainly has the talent and the rest will be up to opportunity. The desire is there for her and I think that will come through provided she gets the opportunity.\u201d Quiet off the pitch, Evans has developed among her teammates at Sydney FC a reputation for her combative nature. Matildas veteran Lisa De Vanna describes her as a \u201cfighter\u201d who isn\u2019t afraid to take on her more senior teammates. \u201cI like to crack jokes when we have four v two drills that I want her on my side, because she\u2019ll go straight through you,\u201d she says. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t care who you are, whether you\u2019re a Matilda or a senior player, she\u2019ll treat you and challenge you like any other person. She always just wants the ball.\u201d The 34-year-old is Australia\u2019s leading international goalscorer and second most capped Matilda. De Vanna sees a drive in her young teammate that she believes will serve her well in the future. \u201cWhen I\u2019ve trained with the Young Matildas, she\u2019s probably the one with the most heart in terms of wanting to win and working hard,\u201d she said. \u201cIt shows that she\u2019s passionate and has a winning mentality. She still has a lot to learn and a lot of room to grow [but] when you have someone with that kind of heart, they are the little 10% things you need. \u201cThat\u2019s what I really like about her, she\u2019s a winner, she\u2019s got a different background to a lot of the girls having left home at such a young age. It\u2019s not an easy thing to do for someone her age and to be where she\u2019s at is impressive.\u201d For now, Evans is still revelling in the excitement of her W-League debut. \u201cGoing from playing barefoot to where I am now, playing in front of crowds, on TV, it was a really unforgettable moment. I honestly really enjoyed last night.\u201d But she\u2019s ambitious to one day play for the Matildas, and has embraced being a role model in her community at such a young age. \u201cI think the younger ones definitely look up to me which I am pretty happy about\u201d she says. I would like the other Indigenous kids and everyone in the Northern Territory and especially in my community to see what I\u2019m doing and maybe help [give] them an idea of what football can do.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
