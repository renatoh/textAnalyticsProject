John Singleton tried in 2000 with a serviceable if unspectacular sequel, a rather asexual and anonymous follow-up to the far more stylish and distinctive original. Almost two decades later and somehow we\u2019re even further from the right answer. Because it turns out that a 2019 version of Shaft probably shouldn\u2019t turn into an unabashed celebration of regressively misogynistic and homophobic masculinity. In Ride Along director Tim Story\u2019s wildly misjudged follow-up, we\u2019re given a Jordan Peterson-level assault on so-called beta millennial males, a strange, angry attack on modernity that feels like the result of a group of bitter men griping about the metrosexualisation of a younger generation. In the latest incarnation, the younger Shaft, played by the undeniably charming Jessie T Usher, is a decaf coffee-drinking, gun-hating, women-respecting data analyst for the FBI, which turns him into a joke and a punchline for both the film and his absentee father. Played by a returning Samuel L Jackson, he\u2019s disgusted to see what his son has turned into at the hands of his mother (a wasted Regina Hall), who raised him in his absence. Convinced he must be gay, he\u2019s determined to turn him into his idea of a real man as the pair investigate the death of younger Shaft\u2019s ex-junkie friend. There\u2019s an inevitable culture clash between the two but elder Shaft is focused on showing his son that listening less to women and shooting more guns will help to show him the way. There\u2019s a smart, self-aware film to be made from a rough kernel of this setup. Focusing on the different definitions of masculinity shared by two generations of men is an intriguing entry point, especially given that one is a father who hasn\u2019t been present for his son\u2019s youth. There\u2019s space for suggesting a happy medium between two extremities but Story\u2019s update has zero interest in nuance or even debate. We\u2019re shown time and time again that for the younger Shaft, the more he embraces modern, \u201csofter\u201d qualities, the less of a man he then is. Skinny jeans, coconut water, desk work \u2013 all treated with unbridled disdain as for his father they all symbolise femininity or, even worse, homosexuality. The film is littered with uneasy jabs not just towards gay men but also the trans community (young Shaft\u2019s boss complains that his biggest problem is that his daughter \u201cwants to be known as Frank\u201d). \u201cYou sure you like pussy?\u201d is repeated by a concerned Jackson with such alarming frequency that I was tempted to ask the critic next to me whether we had somehow been magically transported back to the 70s. But even in the 1971 original, sexual and gender politics were far less troubling. Back then, Shaft even had a gay friend of sorts, a barman who he treated as his equal, but somehow almost 20 years later, every reference to homosexuality is dripping in bile. While 70s Shaft might have been dismissive about the women he was having sex with, he didn\u2019t feel the need to pause the film to give a sermon about how all women desperately want and need to be treated with unquestioned strength and power, something that the modern incarnation deems necessary. It would be one thing if the film presented him as a dinosaur but the script, from Black-ish creator and Girls Trip co-writer Kenya Barris and Family Guy\u2019s Alex Barnow, is too busy hero-worshipping him to bother finding fault. The film presents us with two outwardly strong female characters, in Hall and younger Shaft\u2019s love interest, played by Love, Simon\u2019s Alexandra Shipp, but any feistiness is soon overruled by their visible arousal at men being men. In one of the film\u2019s strangest scenes, younger gun-hating Shaft is forced into a shootout as his date watches smiling, turned on by his blood thirst. Similarly Hall\u2019s date with a beta male (who\u2019s treated with contempt for having manners and being scared by another shootout) is interrupted by a swaggering Jackson, the man who abandoned her with a baby, making her quiver by showing off the two women he has arrived with and embarrassing her date. Even outside of the script\u2019s aggressively repetitive bigotry, the shambolic Scooby Doo plot struggles to grab even the slightest amount of attention. There are half-assed attempts to modernise a familiar narrative with references to an Islamic church and men suffering from PTSD but it soon devolves into dull, by-the-numbers, jarringly over-sentimental sitcom. When action arrives it\u2019s also haphazardly choreographed, especially in a shoddy, confusingly shot finale. Jackson shamelessly showboats throughout but his charisma is buried underneath a shtick that becomes so gratingly obnoxious I almost applauded when Richard Roundtree\u2019s original Shaft made his inevitable cameo. But rather than saving the day, he\u2019s given little to do, and the script chooses to defend both admittedly terrible absentee fathers while throwing Hall\u2019s beleaguered single mother under the bus for feminising her son. It\u2019s frustrating to see such an underrated comic actor like Hall struggle to find space to shine, although she does provide one of the film\u2019s rare funny moments as she talks to herself in a public bathroom. Usher similarly, who was so good in the now cancelled TV comedy Survivor\u2019s Remorse, does his best with a crudely etched character, but any resistance against the film\u2019s regressive politics is ultimately futile. The mission in Shaft is to break down a modern definition of masculinity, to toughen up \u201cdelicate\u201d qualities, such as hating guns and listening to women, and return to the good old days instead. While Jackson\u2019s ribald relic might succeed in forcing his son back to the past, this embarrassingly tone-deaf film fails to take us with him. Shaft is out in the US on 14 June and will be available in other countries on Netflix from 28 June"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
