With McClaren running out of time to reassure Mike Ashley, the owner, that he remains the right man to save Newcastle from relegation, he knows a significant improvement in the Potteries and at home against Bournemouth on Saturday is imperative. Since losing 5-1 at Chelsea Newcastle have had 17 days without a competitive game. They have returned from a training camp at La Manga in Spain with their manager under intense scrutiny from a board anxious to see the team move out of the bottom three. McClaren accepts this may be easier said than done. \u201cThis is the most frustrating team I\u2019ve worked with,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see fantastic performances from individuals one week and we look capable of beating anyone, then the next week it\u2019s the polar opposite and we can lose by five or six goals. \u201cThat inconsistency is a character flaw we have got to put right. We\u2019ve scored seven goals away, that\u2019s the lowest number in the league and it\u2019s not good enough. We have to start demonstrating character away from home. It\u2019s about having courage. Too many times we\u2019ve had things go against us in games and not reacted very well.\u201d The prospect of missing out on next season\u2019s lucrative Premier League TV-rights deal is concentrating minds in the St James\u2019 Park boardroom. \u201cIt\u2019s huge to make sure we stay in the League this season and we understand the severity of the situation we\u2019re in. \u201cThe message we\u2019ve been throwing at the players is that they have to realise the situation we\u2019re in,\u201d the former England coach said. \u201cThe severity and the seriousness of the situation is starting to get heightened and they can\u2019t leave it until the last minute in the hope they\u2019ll get out of it. \u201cSeven goals away from home and two away wins is not good enough. Talent is not enough. We are losing too many games away from home and some of them we\u2019re losing badly. We have to react better to setbacks, be harder, be tougher to beat and be ruthless. We have to start doing it now. We have to make sure we\u2019re safe. We don\u2019t want to be talking about what might have been.\u201d After experimenting with assorted tactics and formations McClaren \u2013 who is considering making Jonjo Shelvey captain in place of the injured Fabricio Coloccini at Stoke \u2013 is convinced that the explanation for the erraticism lies in the players\u2019 minds rather than on a training ground whiteboard. \u201cBelieve me, we\u2019ve tried every formation and system of personnel you could imagine. One week we\u2019re looking very strong and then the next we\u2019re looking like we\u2019re going to concede a lot of goals. It\u2019s a mentality thing.\u201d As Newcastle failed to insert relegation clauses \u2013 automatically reducing players\u2019 wages by 50% should they drop into the Championship \u2013 into individual contracts, there is a suspicion certain players lack sufficient incentive to fight for survival. McClaren disagrees. \u201cI really don\u2019t believe that\u2019s a factor. We\u2019ve got very good individuals and when they click together we can beat anybody, but when they don\u2019t we can lose to anybody.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
