Parliament has been promised a meaningful vote on the withdrawal agreement and the shadow Brexit secretary has laid out six tests he says the deal must meet. But Thornberry told a meeting at the Chatham House thinktank that the government was only likely to agree a vague divorce by October. \u201cIf past evidence of the last few months is anything to go on, it\u2019s going to be a blah, blah, blah, divorce,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to make any decisions. It\u2019s going to continue to kick things down the road. We don\u2019t seem to have come to any difficult decisions at the moment. \u201cThe difficulty is going to be with the meaningful vote in October, which we have secured, is that, what is it we are going to be agreeing on?\u201d Thornberry added: \u201cWe have our six tests. If you hold up blah, blah, blah, to six tests, you\u2019ll probably pass it.\u201d Anti-Brexit Labour backbenchers seized on Thornberry\u2019s comments as evidence key shadow cabinet figures could be paving the way for a vote in favour of May\u2019s deal. One told the Guardian that Starmer had expressed his exasperation \u2013 and promised to \u201csort it\u201d. \u201cPeople are furious with Emily,\u201d he said. As the backlash grew in Westminster, Starmer used an email update to all the party\u2019s MPs on Wednesday night to state: \u201cif these tests are not met, Labour will not support a withdrawal deal on those terms\u201d. The tests include delivering the \u201cexact same benefits as we currently have as members of the single market and customs union?\u201d, as well as asking: \u201cDoes it deliver for all regions and nations of the UK?\u201d Some shadow ministers are known to be concerned about the perception among pro-Brexit Labour voters that the party could try to \u201cblock Brexit\u201d. Chuka Ummuna, of campaign group Open Britain, said: \u201cIt is extraordinary and unacceptable that the shadow foreign secretary [Thornberry] seems to be suggesting that some \u2018blah blah\u2019 from the government will be enough to secure Labour\u2019s support to write the government a blank cheque for Brexit. \u201cIt\u2019s an old-fashioned idea but it is the job of the opposition to hold the government to account and that is what our members expect to see rather than blase chat about \u2018blah blah\u2019 on the most important issue facing the country.\u201d A Labour source insisted: \u201cEmily made clear, as we have done for more than a year now, that the government needs to deliver a deal which meets our six tests, in particular by explaining how we will maintain current arrangements on the Northern Ireland border, and ensure all UK firms maintain the current benefits of access to the single market and customs union. We await to see if we will get any substantive answers on those questions by the time of the vote in October.\u201d Thornberry\u2019s remarks followed a story last week on the website Business Insider that suggested shadow trade secretary Barry Gardiner warned a private dinner in Brussels that voting against the deal could risk a no deal Brexit. \u201cLet\u2019s look at the consequence of there being no deal: the UK will crash out of the EU,\u201d he reportedly said \u2013 though he has subsequently suggested the context referred to the European parliament, which will also be given the opportunity to ratify the agreement. The former shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Owen Smith, who was sacked last week after calling in the Guardian for a referendum on the final Brexit deal, said: \u201cThis is, in part, why I wrote the piece which led to my sacking last week. We are in danger of sleepwalking into supporting the Tories Brexit debacle.\u201d Labour is planning to try to amend the EU withdrawal bill in the House of Lords, to prevent the government from presenting the autumn vote as a choice between accepting the agreement it has reached with Brussels, and plunging out of the EU without no deal at all. Starmer would like to see parliament given the opportunity to direct the government\u2019s next move \u2013 including potentially sending Brexit secretary David Davis back to Brussels to reopen negotiations. Meanwhile, Theresa May is mounting a whirlwind tour of the four nations of the United Kingdom with a promise to keep the country \u201cstrong and united\u201d. The prime minister\u2019s whistlestop tour will take in a Scottish textile factory, a toddler group in Newcastle, a business roundtable in Barry and tea with a group of Polish citizens in London. \u201cOne year until the UK leaves the EU and begins to chart a new course in the world, I am visiting all four nations of the Union to hear from people across our country what Brexit means to them,\u201d she said. \u201cI am determined that as we leave the EU, and in the years ahead, we will strengthen the bonds that unite us, because ours is the world\u2019s most successful union. The UK contains four proud and historic nations, but together we amount to so much more than the sum of our parts and our union is an enormous force for good.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
