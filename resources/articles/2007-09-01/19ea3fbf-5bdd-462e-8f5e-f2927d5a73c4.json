Qualified for their second World Cup by beating Portugal but have since lost to Spain and to Agen and Auch's reserves. In 2003 they lost all four matches, including their heaviest defeat, 84-6 to England, and a disappointing reverse against Uruguay. How they see it A growing army of fans - in a country with eight pitches - hopes for a first World Cup win, against Namibia. A squad with only three men still based on said scarce Georgian fields should have the right resources to comply. The coach Malkhaz Cheishvili's 17-year-old son recently went missing for three days before being rescued from a ravine. Regarding his squad, he says performances, not results, are what interest him. Just as well. The captain The flanker Ilia Zedginidze is fluent in five languages thanks to his degree in foreign diplomacy at Tbilisi University. Helped Auch to win the French second division title last season. The linchpin The Arras fly-half Pavle Jimsheladze, the first Georgian to reach 50 caps, has scored 320 international points. Otherwise, any number of squat, French-based bouncers-cum-props should prove as hard to shift as blood on a dress shirt. How they'll play Hope that thumping enough attackers and ensuring plenty of wrestling at close quarters will keep the score down. Key fact Their nickname, the Lelos, comes from an indigenous sport with strong similarities to rugby. \"Lelo\" is now the Georgian word for try. Omen Their most winnable game is in Lens; the world's leading researchers into the contact lens are based at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Georgia, USA, granted, but feel the synergy.
