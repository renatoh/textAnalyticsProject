In a new report released on Thursday, the NAO castigated the NHS and Department of Health\u2019s failure to collect data on the outcomes experienced by patients helped by the Cancer Drugs Fund as a major weakness. Meg Hillier, the Labour MP who chairs the public accounts committee, said the NHS and the Department of Health\u2019s failure to ensure data collation \u201cmakes no sense\u201d and made it impossible to judge if the scheme had succeeded in extending patients\u2019 survival. The budgets of other NHS services have also suffered as a result of spending sums as large as \u00a3416m a year on the fund, the public spending watchdog found. The fund, set up by the coalition government in 2010, has improved access to more than 40 cancer drugs not usually available on the NHS which might enhance survival, the NAO said. Most recipients had a terminal form of the disease. It has approved requests for more than 74,000 patients since its creation, when some doctors saw it as compromising the role and judgment of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice). Between 2013 and 2015, 51% of those patients received drugs that Nice had assessed but not recommended for routine use either because it did not deem them worthwhile on grounds of cost or clinical effectiveness, or both. Their receipt meant that England increased the use of new cancer drugs relative to other comparable countries, although did not close the gap. The other 49% got drugs that Nice was examining at the time or which had not yet been appraised. While some patients have received drugs costing less than \u00a310,000, others got medication costing more than \u00a3100,000. Initially the fund underspent its budget by 28%. But recently it has overshot it and is likely to spend \u00a370m more than planned in 2015-16, the NAO said. \u201cTaking 2013-14 and 2014-15 together, NHS England overspent the allocated budget for the fund by 35%. The overspend meant that less money was available for other services,\u201d the NAO\u2019s report on its investigation into the fund says. Hillier said that \u201cat a time of increased pressures on NHS funding, the cancer drugs fund is not sustainable in its current form. There needs to be much better control of costs and proper assessment of whether these drugs are making a difference to the health of patients.\u201d Spiralling costs prompted NHS England to axe 16 drugs from the list of medicines the fund would pay for in March, followed by another dozen earlier this month. Cancer charities warned that the withdrawals would mean that some patients died. It is consulting on replacing the fund with a much cheaper \u201cmanaged access fund\u201d that would cover the costs of promising new cancer drugs for a set period while Nice decided if they represented value for money or not. Lady Morgan, the chief executive at Breast Cancer Now, said: \u201cIt\u2019s been clear for some time now that it no longer works. This report just confirms for us what we already knew. \u201cThe government, the NHS and the pharmaceutical industry have overpromised to those that depend on them and, by failing to agree on realistic prices for new drugs, the simple fact is that people will die sooner from breast and other cancers.\u201d Heidi Alexander, the shadow health secretary, said the scaling back of the fund represented a broken promise by the Conservatives, who had pledged to continue investing if re-elected in May. She said: \u201cThe Tories promised to fix the broken system for funding cancer medicines in the last parliament, but failed to do so. Now they are having to remove drugs from the Cancer Drugs Fund, breaking one of David Cameron\u2019s key election pledges to cancer patients.\u201d The Department of Health said it remained committed to the fund."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
