The arrests were in apparent retaliation for the arrest of a top Chinese tech executive in Canada. But Ambassador Lu Shaye said in an op-ed in the Ottawa-based Hill Times on Wednesday that western countries are employing a \u201cdouble standard\u201d in demanding the immediate release of the Canadians. \u201cThe reason why some people are used to arrogantly adopting double standards is due to western egotism and white supremacy,\u201d Lu wrote. \u201cWhat they have been doing is not showing respect for the rule of law, but mocking and trampling the rule of law.\u201d China detained Canadian ex-diplomat Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor on 10 December 2018 on vague allegations of \u201cengaging in activities that endanger the national security\u201d of China. The arrests came 10 days after Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Canada at the request of the US, which wants her extradited to face charges that she misled banks about the company\u2019s business dealings in Iran. A Canadian judge granted Meng bail while she awaits extradition proceedings. Le wrote that \u201celites\u201d in Canada are completely dismissing China\u2019s law by demanding the immediate release of the Canadians. \u201cIt seems that, to some people, only Canadian citizens shall be treated in a humanitarian manner and their freedom deemed valuable, while Chinese people do not deserve that,\u201d Lu said. Lu also wrote that Meng was arrested without violating any Canadian law, suggesting that Canada should never detain someone for extradition. Roland Paris, a former foreign policy adviser to Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, called Lu\u2019s claims \u201chogwash\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the ambassador was trying to accomplish but his article won\u2019t help China\u2019s cause,\u201d Paris said. Paris noted Canada is following extradition law while the Canadians were seized in China under suspicious circumstances and China has held them without charge. Julian Ku, the senior associate dean for academic affairs at Hofstra Law, noted China has still not revealed any specific information about what Kovrig and Spavor are charged with and have not given them a judicial hearing and thus Canada is not wrong with calling the arrests arbitrary. \u201cI am struck by how brazen they are being by making this appeal,\u201d Ku said. \u201cHe says: \u2018You are being racist by not respecting our law.\u2019 That\u2019s an easy card to play.\u201d Lu also seemed to admit detaining the Canadians was in retaliation for the Meng arrest. \u201cI have recently heard a word repeatedly pronounced by some Canadians: bullying. They said that by arresting two Canadian citizens as retaliation for Canada\u2019s detention of Meng, China was bullying Canada. To those people, China\u2019s self-defence is an offence to Canada,\u201d Lu wrote. Alex Lawrence, a spokesman for Canadian foreign minister Chrystia Freeland, did not address Lu\u2019s claims. Huawei, whose billionaire founder Ren Zhengfei has long had ties with both the People\u2019s Liberation Army and the Communist party, has faced national security concerns in multiple countries. Huawei has been banned from involvement in the installation of 5G mobile networks in India, New Zealand and Australia, blocked from making acquisitions in the US and banned from selling phones on military bases by the Pentagon. But, in his column, Lu dismissed such concerns and instead pointed to monitoring and spying programs carried out by the US National Security Agency and the Five Eyes alliance countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the US). \u201cSomething is considered as \u2018safeguarding national security\u2019 when it is done by western countries. But it is termed \u2018conducting espionage\u2019 when done by China. What\u2019s the logic?\u201d he wrote."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
