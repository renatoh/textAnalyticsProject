Wilkinson was on the bench for a third successive game but was quickly pressed into action as the Falcons lost their full-back Matt Burke and centre Epi Taione inside 20 minutes. The fly-half's arrival was greeted by the biggest cheer of the afternoon from a crowd almost double the Tykes' previous record. The applause was not just from Newcastle fans, such is Wilkinson's importance to injury-hit England with Wales looming on February 5. \"He is going to be quite a good player one day,\" said Newcastle's director of rugby Rob Andrew after seeing Wilkinson kick 12 points. \"He could have started this one but coming back like this has been the right thing for him, for the club and for Dave Walder. Dave has played very well for us for the last 18 months when Jonny has been injured.\" Wilkinson's only miss was from a few metres inside his own half. But he inspired most of Newcastle's attacks with some sublime passing and, more importantly given his injury record since his World Cup heroics last year, tackled with typical gusto. \"Some of Jonny's passing was fantastic,\" said Leeds' director of rugby Phil Davies. \"But I am disappointed with the result, especially because we had such a marvellous crowd. To have over 14,000 for a Tykes game would have been a dream nine years ago. Yorkshire is a great sporting county and deserves a great rugby union team, which is what we are trying to build here.\" This defeat left Leeds fourth from bottom after they had taken an early lead when the hooker Mark Regan was driven over from a line-out. The Tykes' fly-half Gordon Ross and Walder, who switched to full-back on Wilkinson's arrival, had earlier swapped penalties. A penalty and a drop-goal from Wilkinson gave Newcastle a half-time advantage and a further penalty after the interval ensured victory. \"You have to fight for every inch and every point in the Premiership and winning away from home is a very difficult thing to do, so I am delighted,\" said Andrew. \"It was close but I was not unduly concerned.\" Leeds: Stimpson; Cardey, Christophers, Snyman, Biggs (Rees, 9); Ross, McMillan; Shelley, Regan, Gerber, Morgan (Murphy, 49), Palmer (capt), Dunbar (Hyde, 49), Parks, Rigney.
