Now that\u2019s the case here: public gatherings are now strictly limited to two people. Even though we know it\u2019s absolutely for the best, we can still acknowledge: this can feel socially oppressive. Post the catastrophic bushfire crisis and in the midst of a global anxiety-inducing emergency, the very thing that psychologically helps us \u2013 social connection \u2013 is being stripped away from us, bit by bit. That\u2019s why some are replacing the term \u201csocial distancing\u201d with the better phrase: physical distancing with social connection. We knew it was coming; we\u2019re following new rules that countries such as Britain have already introduced. But that doesn\u2019t make the pain of the sudden transition any easier. There\u2019s a sweet spot, though; one that it helps to be grateful for at a time like this: the one-on-one catchup has, in my eyes, often been superior to the group friendship catchup. You can tailor your catchup to the other person\u2019s style, humour and interests. I\u2019ll store up anecdotes specifically for them, and tell them varyingly, depending on what I perceive that person values. Dynamics shift dramatically depending on if you\u2019re catching up as a pair or as a group of three or more. It\u2019s the whole two\u2019s company, three\u2019s a crowd thing. But it goes deeper than that. I feel so much safer being vulnerable one on one. I\u2019ve learned that being able to be vulnerable is the true meaning of intimacy. If you\u2019d have asked me a decade ago, I\u2019d have said being intimate just meant having sex and maybe cuddling afterwards. I now know it means being your true self with another human being, without fear of lampoonery or judgment. Often, that\u2019s platonic. In a corruption of Tina\u2019s famous song: what\u2019s sex got to do with it? One on one, I\u2019m far more likely to let people in. I might cry. I won\u2019t feel anywhere near the pressure to consistently make everyone laugh; the exhausting expectation of maintaining levity is released. I ask different questions from the group catchup, too. We move beyond the inane small talk that I loathe (how are you? what have you been up to?) and go straight for the big talk: how are you coping? What are you grateful for? What are you particularly worried about? What are the top three things you\u2019re looking forward to doing when this whole repressive shitstorm is over? We go deeper, quicker. I\u2019m completely different in a group scenario. I still enjoy them, but I often play a persona. I\u2019m less likely to show fragility. I avoid earnestness to minimise the chance of mockery. I\u2019m guilty of mocking others too; I\u2019d probably keep things light by lampooning any earnestness. I\u2019ve sometimes noticed that in friendship group situations I\u2019ve been in, each person plays their part, one that has perhaps become expected of them. People sometimes play heightened versions of themselves: overdramatic; nonchalant; boozy. It\u2019s to perform to the rest of the group. It can sometimes feel like every other line must be a punchline. Or a rant. Anything to maintain the varying concentration levels of the group. I\u2019ve even noticed some friends being contrary in a group environment, perhaps to provoke or tease \u2013 albeit affectionately. Those same friends, one on one, are nowhere near as pugnacious; they\u2019re considerate, understanding and listen more. There are fewer people around for them to worry about how they\u2019re going to be perceived. Of course, levity is important. I love a punchline. Laughter fosters resilience \u2013 essential at times like this. Depending on where you sit on the complex introvert/extrovert scale, one-on-one catchups for some people can feel exhausting. Some of the best public speakers I know are terrified of the intensity of the one-on-one. But for me, nothing beats it. The nuance bamboozled by the group thrives one on one. The complex array of contradictions and hypocrisies that lay within us all can be shared without fear of them being called out for the general amusement of the group. Excuse me if I decline your seven-person Houseparty or Zoom catchup. The video element adds an additional layer to the catchup that, for one-on-one lovers like me, just adds more distance and, somehow, paradoxically, increases frustration and loneliness. So don\u2019t be too downbeat about the maximum of two catchup. In many ways, it could help you connect faster. You may even find the courage to be vulnerable; a revelation that could transform every social catchup you have post Covid-19. I resisted the urge to finish this piece on a punchline.
