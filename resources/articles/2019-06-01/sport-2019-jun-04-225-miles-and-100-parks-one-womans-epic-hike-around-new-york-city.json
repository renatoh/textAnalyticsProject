We envision walking through lush landscapes, or scaling mountains that overlook miles of unspoiled terrain. But Liz Thomas, who held the speed record for the Appalachian Trail for five years, and has explored the world on foot, has evolved her approach to hiking over the years. \u201cI completed my first urban hike in Los Angeles in 2013 and since then, my view of what hiking is has changed,\u201d Thomas tells the Guardian. \u201cIt sparked something in me in how I thought about being active, how I thought about the urban landscape, and how I thought about how people interact with nature and their bodies.\u201d Now dubbed the \u201cQueen of Urban Hiking\u201d, Thomas has since made her way through through San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago, Portland and Pittsburgh. There was one urban territory she had yet to conquer though: New York City. Hiking through New York was always on Thomas\u2019 to-do list, but it wasn\u2019t until the Trust for Public Land, a nonprofit that helps create parks and protect land, reached out to and asked her if she wanted to participate in a urban hike that she took action. Carter Strickland, the New York and New Jersey Director for TPL, saw Thomas speaking at a conference and learned of her previous hikes. \u201cI realized that it was a great fit and we had the scale of on-the-ground programs in New York that might lend itself to urban hikes,\u201d Strickland says. Within six months, he and Thomas organized a hike and last month Thomas logged more than 225 miles over nine days. \u201cFor New Yorkers, they are used to walking,\u201d Strickland says, \u201cbut perhaps they don\u2019t view hiking as a possibility within their own city. We\u2019re hoping with Thomas\u2019 urban hike, we\u2019re able to show city dwellers that it\u2019s possible to explore your own city and experience a little bit of nature without having to venture two hours outside of the city.\u201d The other aim of the hike was to bring awareness to how many New Yorkers don\u2019t have a park within a 10-minute walk from their home. \u201cOne thing I learned on my urban hike in New York is that certain neighborhoods have great access, while other neighborhoods don\u2019t. These playgrounds really play an important function in certain neighborhoods, so providing a park in places where there is otherwise a longer walk to a park is an important part of why I partnered with TPL,\u201d Thomas says. Strickland believes that parks help foster a sense of community that otherwise is hard to nurture. \u201cIt\u2019s good for the environment because it provides shade and rainwater and can provide coastal resilience. But it\u2019s also good for mental and physical health, more importantly and it\u2019s good for creating communities where rich, poor, black and white congregate.\u201d One thing Thomas has learned through urban hiking is how people\u2019s fear of nature can stop them enjoying the outdoors. Walking in the city helps open the door for them to explore their surroundings. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not the same as going out into the woods, but it can be equally cathartic,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s actually more fun in a different way.\u201d Instead of carting around a tent, Thomas stayed in various Airbnbs throughout the city, and had the chance to explore the city\u2019s restaurants instead of eating camp food. \u201cYou become more connected to your surrounding environment when you walk around without a real destination in mind,\u201d Thomas says. \u201cThe beauty with urban hiking is, if you decide you\u2019re done, you can stop whenever you want. And with places like New York where public transportation is so accessible, you can hop on a train or bus and head back home when you want.\u201d Meanwhile, Thomas says interest goes beyond the States. \u201cI recently had someone message me on Instagram from Melbourne, Australia, who said, \u2018You know, this is really inspiring me to hike my own city.\u2019 And that feels really good to know that my message is resonating with others in different parts of the world.\u201d As for her next urban hike, her destination is up in the air. However, the mission will remain the same. \u201cObviously it\u2019s fun for me but I also I think there\u2019s just so much to learn from experiencing a landscape like going to neighborhoods in your city that you would never normally go to, and experiencing it by foot,\u201d Thomas says. \u201cYou also get an idea of what\u2019s it like to live in this as a kid who walks to school in this neighborhood, to be a grandparent who lives across from this park in this neighborhood, and it\u2019s just something you don\u2019t get in that sort of fly by experience that you would have in a car.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
