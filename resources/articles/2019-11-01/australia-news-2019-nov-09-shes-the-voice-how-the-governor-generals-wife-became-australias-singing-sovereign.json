But mostly Hurley, a former teacher and the wife of the governor general, David Hurley, has one song for everyone: You Are My Sunshine. Since the Hurleys moved from New South Wales Government House in May back to Canberra, the song has become a staple that she deploys to boost morale of staff and guests at official functions. \u201cBut just the chorus, the verses are sad,\u201d she says. I\u2019ve spent the morning watching Hurley wander between tables of war widows (average age 81, according to the governor general), microphone in hand, leading them in song over cucumber and smoked salmon sandwiches. Every song is an all-in special and not knowing the words is no excuse \u2013 guests are provided a Government House song book so they don\u2019t stumble as they are led through a repertoire that includes It\u2019s a Long Way to Tipperary, When the Red, Red Robin and Singin\u2019 in the Rain. \u201cMy biggest passion is to get people to sing,\u201d Hurley tells Guardian Australia. \u201cAustralia, I believe, has had it beaten out of them \u2013 if you weren\u2019t perfect, if you didn\u2019t get picked in the choir, that person goes away for the rest of their life believing they can\u2019t sing. \u201cI can\u2019t say how many men have told me that they can\u2019t sing. And it\u2019s because they were told when they were six they wouldn\u2019t be in the choir \u2026 Or kids are told to mime, just move your lips. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t say that if a child can\u2019t read well \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t say \u2018You\u2019re really not good at reading, just give it a miss\u2019, or maths or any other subject.\u201d The curious practice developed 18 months into David Hurley\u2019s term as NSW governor, first with Linda adding her own lyrics to the tune of I am Australian for a ball to celebrate 170 years of Government House. It then developed into full-blown compositions with the help of \u201ca navy band man\u201d and David Butts. Butts, the musician dressed in blue from Wiggles forerunner the Hooley Dooleys, came on as a speechwriter but then helped Hurley realise her dream to write and stage a musical at Government House. \u201cI wasn\u2019t allowed to coerce anyone to be in it, so it was put out to the staff: \u2018If you want to be in the Government House musical\u2019 \u2026 They all \u2013 a lot of them \u2013 rallied. I taught each group their song, then it was up to them how to perform it, they had props, they could do whatever they liked. \u201cAt the end the staff said \u2018Why didn\u2019t we do this three years ago?\u2019 They felt it was \u2026 a real bonding thing.\u201d Staff are not universally pleased with the practice but Hurley insists it is for everyone\u2019s own good. She cites studies that show singing has health benefits but most of all she relies on the testimony of her own guests. \u201cThe women today said, \u2018Oh that made us all feel happier\u2019.\u201d \u201cNo one has come up to me and said \u2018I\u2019m never coming here again, that\u2019s the most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve seen at Government House\u2019. \u201cThey probably wouldn\u2019t say that to me, they\u2019d be well mannered enough not to.\u201d But there are limits. \u201cSometimes I get a little bit nervous, how it might go. If the Queen came here, for example, I wouldn\u2019t sing at a reception with the Queen. I wouldn\u2019t sing You Are My Sunshine. You kind of have to judge when to do it and when not to do it. But more or less [the response has] been positive.\u201d Jan Kirk, one of the attendees at the morning tea, is full of praise for Hurley\u2019s song choices. \u201cI loved all of them, I was brought up on these songs,\u201d she says, singling out You Are My Sunshine because she used to sing it \u201cjokingly\u201d with her husband. Peter MacLeod-Miller, archdeacon at St Matthew\u2019s Anglican Church in Albury, describes Hurley as \u201camazing\u201d and a \u201csecret weapon\u201d, while the singing sessions are \u201clike therapy\u201d. He insists it is not just the war widows who respond \u2013 he\u2019s seen the singing go down just as well with children, mental health professionals and Indigenous Australians. MacLeod-Miller and a Government House minder both cite a trip to Weipa in the Pilbara \u2013 even miners are not immune to the charms of group singing. \u201cShe got a group of miners in northern Australia to sing You Are My Sunshine three times \u2026 a stick of gelignite couldn\u2019t do that, to move a group of miners,\u201d MacLeod-Miller says. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazingly democratic thing to do. It\u2019s counter-cultural \u2026 it\u2019s almost subversive \u2013 if you don\u2019t think the office [of governor general] belongs in the museum, well, she turns it into a gymnasium, stretching people in new ways.\u201d Jim Smail, a Canberra Legacy member who knows Linda from the St Andrews Presbyterian church and its choir, says he was honoured that Linda came from Sydney back to Canberra to sing at his wife\u2019s funeral three years ago. Smail has been to the widows\u2019 morning tea before but \u201cthis is the first time since I\u2019ve been involved in it that we\u2019ve had a sing-song\u201d. \u201cBut then, of course, the terrier behind this is Linda \u2026 [It\u2019s usually] just a couple of speeches and the ladies enjoy talking to each other. \u201cOh yes absolutely [I prefer it this way],\u201d he says, with extra praise for Linda\u2019s \u201cbeautiful\u201d composition. Hurley is also a patron of Solid Rock, a Christian ministry to women in defence, is known to hula hoop to keep fit and lists among other interests recycling and reducing the use of plastics. \u201cI am a grassroots environmental person \u2013 I can\u2019t control global warming but I can actually control what comes into my house and what I buy,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are so many things in packaging that we shouldn\u2019t have,\u201d she says, citing plastic in sticks of cotton-tipped buds, hooks on products like socks and wrapped fruit. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I can do \u2013 I\u2019m still thinking about that,\u201d she says, suggesting anti-waste and recycling forums at Government House as a possibility. Next week Hurley will also meet with the Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation, a not-for-profit that aims to reduce harmful packaging. But in the meantime she\u2019s happy to be known for the singing. \u201cI think \u2026 as the wife of a governor or governor general, you need to have ownership of something,\u201d she says. \u201cNo matter who your partner \u2013 whether it\u2019s a male or a female in the big position \u2013 we\u2019re always a team. I would say that most husbands and wives \u2026 do it as a team. \u201cI can have my thing and David has his thing. He\u2019s the governor general, there\u2019s no way in this planet I want to be a governor general but I love being part of the team doing the things that I can do to help people.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
