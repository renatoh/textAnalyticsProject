Rather than a side project for two rappers with a shared interest in lyrical exuberance, Run the Jewels has become its own branch of alternative hip-hop. Industrial beats are the bed for raps that veer from politics to sex and visceral humour, often in the space of two lines. It has won awards and a sizeable fanbase. The politics has drawn greatest attention, especially for Mike, a prominent protester against police violence and supporter of Bernie Sanders. Those hoping for a manifesto won\u2019t find it here; what politics there are are personal. 2100 begins with a call for resistance but passes into more poignant observations and ends with a sigh and a call for peace. The most vivacious track of all, Call Ticketron, is the least political, with Mike performing a fantastic feat of double-time rhyming while El-P jokes about doing \u201cpush-ups nude off the edge of cliffs\u201d. The formula is probably becoming familiar, but its time is now."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
