The vital ingredients were aluminium powder, ammonium nitrate and detonators, said the supergrass Mohammed Babar. Babar told the court that he and an alleged plotter, Omar Khyam, talked of placing the detonators inside plastic bags and putting them in bottles of shampoo or shaving cream. The plan was also for Babar to smuggle a cassette recorder concealing detonators through Iran, Turkey and eastern Europe, then pass it to Mr Khyam in Belgium to take to the UK. He and Mr Khyam discussed disguising the ammonium nitrate in bags of almonds, raisins or dried apricots. These would then be sent to the UK in a parcel transported by the delivery company Federal Express, the court heard. This plan was abandoned when they learned that FedEx required a health certificate to ship foodstuffs, Babar said. They also thought of hiding the ammonium nitrate in a shipping container. Babar, 31, an American citizen, also told the court he and Mr Khyam had bought 10 to 15 packets of aluminium powder in Lahore. Babar, who has already pleaded guilty in the US to offences connected to a British bomb plot, has been given immunity from prosecution to give evidence against seven men. The defendants - Mr Khyam, 24, his brother Shujah Mahmood, 19, Waheed Mahmood, 34, and Jawad Akbar, 22, all from Crawley, West Sussex, Salahuddin Amin, 31, from Luton, Anthony Garcia, 23, of Ilford, Essex, and Nabeel Hussain, 20, of Horley, Surrey - all deny conspiracy to cause explosions in the UK. Mr Khyam, Mr Garcia and Mr Hussain also deny possessing 600kg (1,300lb) of ammonium nitrate fertiliser for terrorism. Mr Khyam and Shujah Mahmood deny possessing aluminium powder for terrorism. Babar later told the court he had gone with some of the alleged plotters to a training camp in Malakand, Pakistan, and Mr Khyam had claimed to have received orders from al-Qaida's \"Number Three\". The case continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
