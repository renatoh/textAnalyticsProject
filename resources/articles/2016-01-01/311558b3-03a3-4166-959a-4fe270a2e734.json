As is the debate on their respective merits, in which passions often run high \u2013 so much so that most people seem to have forgotten that not so long ago the fight was a three-way affair. Freddie Burns won the last of his five England caps in the 36-13 defeat by New Zealand in Hamilton in June 2014, at the end of what, with characteristic openness, the then Gloucester stand\u2011off acknowledged had been a season made difficult by uncertainty over his domestic future. Moving to Leicester, however, did not lead to Burns regaining the level of performance which had helped him become the Premiership\u2019s top scorer in 2012-13. In a Tigers side who ground rather than sliced their way to the Premiership semi-finals, Burns\u2019s lack of consistent accuracy with the boot led to him slipping behind Owen Williams in the Welford Road pecking order. Only later in the season, after working with the former England fly-half Paul Grayson, did the then 24-year-old improve his kicking success rate to somewhere near the 80% mark that is the minimum expected and required, by which time he was not even on the edge of the international picture. Returning from holiday last summer determined to make the most of a full pre-season, his motivation increased by the prospect of watching a World Cup he had hoped to take part in, Burns then found himself going through an episode that left its mark in more ways than one. \u201cI went for dinner with my missus and her family and her sister asked why was I winking at her. And I could feel my eyesight on one side, my blinking, being quite heavy. That night I woke up in the early hours and went downstairs for a glass of water and as I poured it in my mouth it just poured out, and I realised I couldn\u2019t use the left side of my face. \u201cI felt fine in myself so didn\u2019t panic too much but obviously it wasn\u2019t the nicest thing at that time in the morning. I went to the doctor\u2019s and he told me I had Bell\u2019s palsy.\u201d Having learned that seven out of 10 times the condition, one of facial muscle weakness or paralysis, is temporary, and need not impact on his rugby, Burns did not let it affect his training \u2013 and is now doing what he can to help others. \u201cIt\u2019s a condition no one really knows too much about, but one in 5,000 will be affected so it\u2019s not that uncommon and hopefully I can use my position to make others feel easier,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example, if you wake in the early hours with a problem with your face, you can call a helpline and I\u2019m trying to promote that because it can be tough to cope with psychologically, as well as physically. \u201cFor me I had no choice: being in a rugby environment, the only thing that was going to happen was the boys were going to take the piss out of me walking around with an eye patch for two and a half months because I couldn\u2019t blink. \u201cMy left eye still blinks a bit funny when I get tired but now I feel pretty normal. I was lucky because my face stayed still, whereas with some children and older people, the face can drop and that\u2019s the bit that struggles to come back.\u201d In the circumstances, breaking his jaw in the final warm-up match before the season started would have left him shaking his head in disbelief, if it hadn\u2019t hurt so much. \u201cOne way or another the face has taken a bit of a battering and it\u2019s probably a good job I had a girlfriend beforehand! Seriously, I\u2019ve just tried to carry on as normal as possible and if I can do a little bit to help, great.\u201d Having finally made his first start of the season in the European Champions Cup win over Munster at Welford Road last month, and extended his contract to boot, Burns now finds himself up against Farrell in what should be one of the matches of the season to date, at Allianz Park. \u201cFaz has been outstanding this year for Sarries while I\u2019m still trying to get my match fitness, so maybe there\u2019s not so much pressure on me. I just have to focus on my own performance and what I do for Leicester. But I\u2019m in a good place again and we\u2019re all excited because we\u2019ve played in fits and starts, but only been beaten once, and there\u2019s so much more to come.\u201d The influence of the new head coach, Aaron Mauger, has added to the sense that something different is being built at Leicester, Burns says. \u201cThe way Maugs has come in and changed the way we go about things, having that ability to play with your heads up and seeing what\u2019s on and move the ball a little bit more, it certainly suits me a lot more than it did maybe last year. It\u2019s good to play that kind of rugby, so perhaps I\u2019m more suited to Leicester now and Leicester\u2019s more suited to me. \u201cI\u2019ve got huge ambition to get back in the England squad but right now I\u2019m simply looking to get bedded in here, keeping the shirt and contributing towards team performances. Hopefully if Leicester stay there or thereabouts I\u2019ll be in a conversation somewhere.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
