Mrs Kingsmill said that men are still paid 18% more than women, despite the 1975 Equal Pay Act. At that time the gulf was 31%. She said: \"I'd like to see it down in single figures in five years\". Mrs Kingsmill, who is also deputy chairman of the competition commission, has been set an autumn deadline to complete a review and come up with proposals to narrow the gap. Among her proposals is a recommendation that companies be forced to outline their approach to \"human capital management\" in their annual reports. This will be a statistical analysis of their treatment of both men and women. The radical suggestion which could result in a \"best practice\" code is likely to be taken up by the accounting standards board, which confirmed yesterday that it is aiming to publish a consultation document early next year . Mrs Kingsmill said she would step back from endors ing a mandatory annual survey of pay structures as favoured by the equal opportunities commission. Her approach is expected to endorsed by government, which is anxious to avoid conflict with business leaders. She said her aim was to \"capture the hearts and minds\" of top executives and avoid confrontation. She believes that pressure from major City investors will force companies to comply with the proposed codes. \"Some of the companies with US experience have al ready learnt the lesson,\" she said. However, while Mrs Kingsmill said she felt she was \"pushing at an open door\" after her discussions with the chief executives of 50 of the companies in the FTSE 100 share index, other experts on equal pay were less convinced. A spokeswoman for the equal opportunities commission said: \"A lot of companies know there is a problem but do not believe that it exists in their organisation\". Her final proposals will also include a guide which might include recognition of different career paths and the so-called work-life balance as well as meeting criteria about fair remuneration packages. \"Companies largely recruit staff in equal numbers but are not developing them at the same rate.\" She cited statistics showing that women start out on an equal footing at ages 16-19, but by the age of 50-54 earn two thirds of their male counterparts. \"After the age of 30 the gap widens.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
