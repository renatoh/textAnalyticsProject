Spurs hope to be playing in the ground by early February, although the timings look tight. They confirmed the latest delay on Wednesday when they said the Manchester United game scheduled for 13 January will be played at Wembley, their temporary home. Pochettino was in cocksure and mischievous mood, buoyed by Tuesday\u2019s Champions League last-16 qualification with the 1-1 draw at Barcelona and the knowledge he is coveted property. There is an awareness at Spurs that they face a fight to keep Pochettino next summer, with Real Madrid and United most prominent among his admirers. Pochettino knows it, he knows that Levy knows it and he teased him over it. But what he most wanted to get across was his admiration for how the chairman is driving the stadium project. \u201cThe chairman is so tired \u2013 the last few months, he didn\u2019t sleep,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t realise the magnitude of the project. It doesn\u2019t just depend on him. I think it\u2019s more than 20 companies that are working there. It\u2019s why he needs to feel the love from the fans and the club. He is working so hard \u2013 too hard \u2013 to leave a legacy forever.\u201d Pochettino described Levy as \u201cnot an easy man\u201d but one who wants to \u201ccreate things\u201d for others. \u201cHe built the player lodge at the training ground, for example \u2013 it\u2019s a five-star boutique hotel,\u201d the manager added. \u201cI asked him when he is going to sleep there and he said: \u2018No, not for me. That\u2019s for you and the players.\u2019\u201d The manager could not resist a series of jokes at Levy\u2019s expense either, stating how the chairman is normally the first person to be blamed for the team\u2019s defeats, which is \u201csometimes deserved\u201d. Pochettino was asked whether he and Levy laughed about the managerial links to Real and United. \u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t laugh,\u201d the manager said, with a smile. \u201cI don\u2019t get bored [about reading them] but he is maybe worried. It\u2019s not nice for Daniel to hear all that history. Should he be worried? No \u2013 [it\u2019s] because he\u2019s a worry man. That is different. He suffers. Because he\u2019s jealous about me. He\u2019s a very jealous person. Because of the rumours, eh?\u201d The manager\u2019s flippant tone illustrated both the depth of his relationship with Levy and his position of strength at the club. He was also asked whether he needed to reassure Levy about his long-term commitment.\u201cNo,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt\u2019s like when the sporting director or the president appears to say: \u2018We trust in the manager.\u2019 And the next game \u2013 lose and he is out. If you reassure [over] something, it\u2019s because you are thinking in different [ways].\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
