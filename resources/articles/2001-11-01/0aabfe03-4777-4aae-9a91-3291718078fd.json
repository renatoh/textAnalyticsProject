He got back from work, grabbed his silver cocktail shaker, made me and him a Sea Breeze and then said, 'What are you up to tonight Cavvers?' The first time he said this - way back when we were freshers at Bristol University - I thought he fancied me and was asking me out on a date. I soon realised, when I picked him up in my pastel blue Panda and drove him to the Moon Club and then watched him hob-nob with his mates while I stood drinking an orange juice at the bar alone, that it wasn't me he was interested in but my car. I loved him anyway though. Still do. Anyway, when we were sharing a flat in London I carried on driving him to clubs on a Friday night. It was part of our ritual. And the only reason why I used to drive him to clubs on a Friday night (and then loiter at the bar again) was because the next day - every Saturday without fail - he got up, staggered into the tiny, filthy kitchen we never cleaned wearing his rather fetching tartan dressing gown, and then proceeded to make vegetarian chilli. The making of the chilli always commenced at 2pm. For the half hour previously he'd ask me this; 'Did I get drunk last night?' Answer: 'Yes.' 'Oh. Did I listen to music last night?' Answer: 'Yes.' 'Oh. Was it the Smiths again?' Answer: 'Yes.' He would then look suitably put out, disappear into the kitchen and soon I'd hear the chopping and stirring and groaning and the plink-plink fizz of Alka Seltzer and then at 3pm he'd wander in, give me a plate of delicious soya beans and say, 'Do you mind if I watch Bicycle Thieves?' Answer: 'Yes.' He'd always watch it anyway though. Next month: watching racing on Boxing Day"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
