The striker, who has scored 26 goals for Tottenham in his breakthrough season, is keen to play for Gareth Southgate in the Under-21 European Championship in the Czech Republic this summer. However, Spurs are due to travel to Australia as soon as the Premier League finishes, to play a lucrative friendly against Sydney FC on 30 May. The Under-21 tournament starts in mid-June, with England\u2019s first match against Portugal on 18 June, the first of three group games in six days. The England manager, Roy Hodgson, who has said Southgate can pick any senior players who qualify for the Under-21s, plans to speak to Mauricio Pochettino about how best to handle the 21-year-old if he requires a rest at the end of a season in which he has become a first-team regular. \u201cIf he needs a rest, there\u2019s a great opportunity when the season ends before our Under-21s get-together to give him a rest,\u201d said Hodgson. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect me in good faith to say: \u2018He should be doing the Australia trip and then resting when the Under-21s pitch up.\u2019 I can\u2019t go along with that. Personally speaking, playing for England at Under-21 level at a tournament is more important than a friendly in Australia.\u201d The England Under-21 manager, Gareth Southgate, expects to have Kane as part of his summer squad. \u201cEverything I\u2019ve heard Harry discuss over the last few months is that he\u2019s been a big part of this group that want to go and have a crack at being European champions, so I don\u2019t foresee that that will change,\u201d he said. Hodgson said the addition of Kane to Daniel Sturridge, Danny Welbeck, Raheem Sterling and the captain, Wayne Rooney, in the senior England squad for the European Championship qualifier against Lithuania at Wembley next week and a friendly against Italy in Turin had given him by far the best crop of strikers at his disposal since he took the job before Euro 2012. \u201cThey are enormously better, much better,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019d all agree that they\u2019ve got talent, there\u2019s potential there, they\u2019ve got skill levels that we haven\u2019t always seen. They\u2019ve got pace we haven\u2019t always seen.\u201d Aston Villa\u2019s Fabian Delph and the Spurs full-back Kyle Walker have also been included in Hodgson\u2019s squad. There was no place for Kane\u2019s Tottenham team-mate Ryan Mason, while West Brom\u2019s Saido Berahino has lost his place."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
