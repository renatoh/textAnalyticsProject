They don't have a live reputation as \"the greatest rock'n'roll band in the world\" like the Rolling Stones, or ever held a stadium under their spell like Queen. However, they have quietly become a captivating live experience. Culled from five years of live BBC sessions, this 11-track collection works as a \"greatest hits\" set (if unutterably yearning songs such as Bullets had been hits) and captures the intimate, often improvised energy of their shows, with acoustic guitars, banjos, electronica and the much-loved tweeting stuffed bird. The haunting mantra Tamatant Tilay appears from their collaboration with desert blues icons Tinariwen. With Whiskey and Jenny Again, \u2013 a murder ballad set in a Little Chef \u2013 are simply beautiful songs, and there's a curveball in the shape of a totally reinvented version of Blue Pearl's rave anthem Naked in the Rain \u2026 A lovely document."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
