The warning comes as David Cameron\u2019s extremism task force meets for the first time in this parliament on Thursday, and peers prepare to vote on the new guidelines tightening the rules that allow extremists speakers on university campuses only so long as they are challenged. The Home Office is concerned peers could reject the regulations, which are due to come into force next week, on the grounds they inhibit free speech and thought on campuses. In a pointed letter to the NUS president Megan Dunn, higher education minister Jo Johnson has said he is disturbed by a motion passed at the NUS conference to oppose the Counter-Terrorism and Security Act, the government\u2019s main piece of counter-terrorism legislation. Although he concedes the NUS is doing some good work, he also asserts contradictory statements made by NUS officials, including those that described the government\u2019s approach as a \u201cracialised, Islamophobic witch-hunt\u201d. Earlier in the year, another officer claimed that strategies such as Prevent \u201cultimately exist to police Muslim expression\u201d. He said such views cause division, and points to motions passed by student unions in a series of institutions opposing Prevent, including King\u2019s College London, Durham and Soas, University of London. He adds: \u201cUniversities represent an important arena for challenging extremist views. It is important there can be active challenge and debate on issues relating to counter-terrorism and provisions for academic freedom are part of the Prevent guidance for universities and colleges. \u201cIt is my firm view that we all have a role to play in challenging extremist ideologies and protecting students on campus. Ultimately, the Prevent strategy is about protecting people from radicalisation. \u201cIt is therefore disappointing to see overt opposition to the Prevent programme \u2026The legal duty that will be placed on universities and colleges highlights the importance that the government places on this.\u201d Johnson was in part responding to a letter from Dunn stressing that the NUS has no connection formal or informal with the pressure group Cage, which advocates the release of alleged terrorists and has previously been accused of being apologists for the Isis terrorist Mohammed Emwazi, known as \u201cJihadi John\u201d. In a counter-terrorism speech in July, Cameron said the NUS had shamed itself by working with Cage, an allegation that angered the NUS. The government\u2019s new extremism analysis unit claims at least 70 events featuring hate speakers were held on campuses last year. David Cameron said: \u201cAll public institutions have a role to play in rooting out and challenging extremism. It is not about oppressing free speech or stifling academic freedom, it is about making sure that radical views and ideas are not given the oxygen they need to flourish. \u201cSchools, universities and colleges, more than anywhere else, have a duty to protect impressionable young minds\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
