Harvey Proctor, 72, accused the Metropolitan police of effectively leaking his name to the media in a \u201cquite outrageous\u201d breach after searching his home in March 2015. The former politician gave evidence for a second day on Friday in the trial of Carl Beech, previously known by the alias \u201cNick\u201d, who is charged with making up allegations about a supposed VIP paedophile ring. The trial at Newcastle crown court has heard that Beech accused Proctor of being involved in the sexual abuse and murder of three boys in the late 1970s and early 80s, claims Proctor has described in his evidence as the \u201cravings of a fantasist\u201d. Proctor told jurors on Friday that he had \u201cevery right to be indignant\u201d about the investigation and how his name became public the day after his home at Belvoir Castle, near Grantham in Leicestershire, was raided on 4 March 2015. He told the court he believed that a police officer confirmed news of the house search to Beech while it was taking place, leading to it being leaked to the Exaro news agency. Proctor said police had assured him that he would not be identified, but hours later his office received a call and an email from a journalist from Exaro seeking to confirm the police search. \u201cI think he [the journalist] in part knew about that because Nick had been told by DC Chatfield on the day of the search. Where was DC Chatfield on the day of the search? He was in my house,\u201d Proctor said. \u201cThe police had told [Beech] on the day of the search from within my home because DC Chatfield was the family liaison officer for Nick. Quite outrageous.\u201d Beech, 51, is accused of falsely claiming he was among the victims of an alleged group of establishment figures including senior politicians and military and intelligence officers who raped, kidnapped and murdered boys in the late 1970s and early 80s. Proctor told jurors he had to wait three and a half months to be interviewed by police about the allegations of child rape and murder, despite repeatedly pressing them to question him at the earliest opportunity. \u201cThese allegations were so absurd and if they genuinely thought I had murdered anyone, why would they have waited three and half months to interview me, and then interview me on a voluntary [basis] but not charge?\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re allowing a murderer to roam the streets of Leicestershire for three and a half months? An absurdity, but of course just one more absurdity in the Metropolitan police\u2019s Operation Midland.\u201d Under cross-examination by Beech\u2019s barrister, Collingwood Thompson, Proctor said he was not responsible for any of the allegations the defendant had \u201cmaliciously and mischievously\u201d made against him. Beech denies 12 counts of perverting the course of justice and one of fraud. The trial continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
