There were only three phones in the building \u2013 one each for the owner and business manager and one shared (and fought over) by the editorial and advertising staff. The latter was a pedestal instrument. It was on a high ledge in the advertising room and you had to stand up to use it. The number was SME 0095. It could have been the phone installed in 1884 when the paper was launched. Colleagues on the staff who also used it included two who became notable Guardian writers \u2013 John Fairhall (education) and Baden Hickman (religious affairs).
