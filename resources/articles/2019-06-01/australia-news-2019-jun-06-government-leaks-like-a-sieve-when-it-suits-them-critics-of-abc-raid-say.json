On Thursday the shadow attorney general said Scott Morrison and Peter Dutton \u201ccan\u2019t hide behind the police\u201d because \u201cthe government\u201d referred the matters for investigation. \u201cIt\u2019s the government which made a decision that these leaks, not all the other leaks that occur within government administration, warrant investigation,\u201d he told Radio National. It comes after the Greens senator Nick McKim accused the government of \u201cleaking sensitive information like a sieve when it suits them\u201d and Centre Alliance\u2019s Rex Patrick said it was \u201cabhorrent\u201d that public interest reports applying scrutiny to officials\u2019 actions are now being investigated. The comments were prompted by two raids in two days: targeting Annika Smethurst of News Corp Australia on Tuesday over a story about a leaked plan for greater powers to spy on Australians; and the ABC on Wednesday for an investigation about alleged unlawful killings in Afghanistan by Australian special forces. Morrison has reasserted that the raids occurred at arm\u2019s length from the government but conceded that they were part of investigations commenced after department heads referred leaks to the AFP. Morrison said the raids were the result of \u201ca process of investigations being pursued by independent law enforcement agency, and they are acting in accordance with the laws that govern their behaviour\u201d. \u201cThis is not a matter that has been directed or in any way involves government ministers and it would be inappropriate if it did.\u201d The prime minister suggested he is \u201copen to discussing\u201d concerns about security laws\u2019 impact on the press. Dreyfus accused the prime minister of \u201chollow words\u201d by claiming to believe in press freedom but refusing to explain the \u201cextraordinary\u201d raids which targeted Smethurst in her home and included authority to delete material found at the ABC. \u201cCan we expect further raids? Why did these happen now when Mr Morrison and Mr Dutton were out of the country.\u201d Dreyfus suggested Labor could support a Senate inquiry, which the Greens have proposed, into the raids. Dreyfus said it was \u201cabsurd\u201d that plans to extend Australian Signals Directorate spying powers to Australians should not be publicly discussed, because the matter would have had to come before parliament anyway. Australia\u2019s laws criminalise unauthorised disclosures by public servants, and provisions that prohibit publication of proscribed information also apply to journalists \u2013 even before new offences were added in espionage laws that passed in 2018. Over the last three years referrals to the police resulted in raids investigating leaks about the national broadband network and Peter Dutton\u2019s ministerial intervention in the case of two foreign au pairs. A report in the Australian quoting home affairs department advice about the medevac legislation was referred to the police and earned an extraordinary rebuke from Australia\u2019s top spy chief for misrepresenting the advice as from Asio. Dreyfus noted there \u201chasn\u2019t been a raid\u201d in relation to the leak of that material \u201cthat suited the government\u201d. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been any further action taken in respect of it,\u201d he said. Police investigated a leak from the then employment minister Michaelia Cash\u2019s office tipping media off about an imminent raid on the Australian Workers\u2019 Union, resulting in a brief to prosecutors who then declined to prosecute. McKim told Guardian Australia the raids \u201care yet more evidence that Australia is lurching towards a police state\u201d. \u201cThese raids were made possible by the steady flow of laws which have consolidated power, eroded privacy and removed rights, all supported by the LNP and ALP,\u201d he said. \u201cThis government leaks sensitive information like a sieve when it suits them, yet disgracefully pursues journalists and media outlets which embarrass them. \u201cAustralia needs stronger whistleblower protections, a charter of rights and better protections for journalists and citizens from government overreach.\u201d Patrick said the public had a \u201cright to know\u201d about discussions between the heads of the defence and home affairs ministries discussing extending spying powers to Australian citizens. He said Smethurst\u2019s report was \u201csimply embarrassing\u201d to the agencies rather than supplying information that could harm national security. Allegations against Australian troops were similarly \u201cmatters that there should be public scrutiny of\u201d. \u201cBoth relate to national security, but they were both issues that dealt with uncomfortable conversations \u2013 the conduct of officials \u2013 that\u2019s the bit I find abhorrent in this instance.\u201d Patrick agreed there was a double standard about how vigorously certain leaks were pursued, citing the example of the police refusing to investigate a leak to journalist Niki Savva about the decision to prosecute former Asis spy Witness K and his lawyer for disclosing that Australia spied on East Timor. Savva told the ABC\u2019s Insiders that the commonwealth director of public prosecutions made a \u201cstrong recommendation\u201d to prosecute Witness K, suggesting that the attorney general, Christian Porter, did not have \u201cany choice but to proceed\u201d by giving approval. On 2 July 2018 the independent MP Andrew Wilkie wrote to the AFP seeking an investigation into the \u201cimproper disclosure to a journalist of protected information\u201d. Superintendent Mark Colbran wrote back on 18 July 2018 declining to investigate on the basis that there was \u201cinsufficient information to determine whether a commonwealth offence has been committed\u201d. Colbran explained that an operations committee makes an assessment based on \u201cthe nature of the alleged crime, the gravity of the matter, the sensitivity of the matter, the effect of the alleged criminality\u201d, among other factors. Lawyer Bernard Collaery, who represents Witness K and is also being prosecuted, said the law \u201cmust be applied equally\u201d, citing the \u201cnumerous leaks\u201d that have not been investigated. Collaery noted that before she became foreign affairs minister the then shadow minister Julie Bishop disclosed in 2010 that Australia forges passports, which he described as a \u201chuge breach of security\u201d. Emily Howie, the Human Rights Law Centre legal director, said the raids were \u201cclearly a show of force\u201d which sent a \u201creally worrying\u201d message to whistleblowers and journalists working on national security stories. \u201cWe\u2019re really concerned with the chilling effect this has on others coming forward. \u201cI think there\u2019s been a clear and worrying trend of governments trying to silence whistleblowers and journalists who want to reveal information in the public interest.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
