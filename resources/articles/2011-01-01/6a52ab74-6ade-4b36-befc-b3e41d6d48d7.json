Not to judge by the share price, up another 5% today to 239p amid a short squeeze or bid rumours, depending on which tale you prefer. What about the situation on the ground? How is the online supermarket coping with the undeniable increase in demand for its service? The sample size is one, but it would be remiss not to mention that Ocado has spoiled its previously unblemished record of on-time delivery to the Pratley pad. One recent delivery was cancelled due to a \"power cut\" at the Hertfordshire depot; the following day's replacement order arrived an hour and 20 minutes late. At various points, the kindly customer service folk offered a total of \u00a365 off the next order. Thanks very much, chaps, but it sounds an expensive way to do business."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
