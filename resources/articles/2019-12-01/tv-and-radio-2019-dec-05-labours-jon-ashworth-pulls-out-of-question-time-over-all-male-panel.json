The shadow health secretary said he had \u201cno idea\u201d it was an all-male line-up when he agreed take part in the programme, so has agreed to step aside in favour of the Oxford East Labour candidate Anneliese Dodds. The BBC made clear it never intends to have an all-male line-ups on its five-person panels but instead relies on political parties to put forward female politicians. Ashworth was a last-minute replacement for the shadow cabinet member Laura Pidcock, who had pulled out for personal reasons. Harriet Harman, the longest continuously serving female MP, complained: \u201cOh for goodness sake! Why does BBC think men have all the answers!!! I thought we sorted this in the last century!\u201d The BBC said it was unhappy with the situation: \u201cYou\u2019re right \u2013 all-male panels are not the ideal in 2019. The (female) Labour politician we announced yesterday had to pull out for personal reasons. We\u2019re pleased to say Anneliese Dodds has now agreed to appear, and we\u2019re grateful to her for stepping in at short notice.\u201d Question Time panels usually have at least one political pundit or public figure appearing alongside four politicians, making it easier to ensure at the very least a bare minimum of female representation on the panel. But with just days until the general election, the BBC had decided to offer slots to five major political parties and \u2013 after Pidcock withdrew \u2013 all the parties had nominated a male politician to take part in the programme. Instead, Dodds will be joined by the Conservatives\u2019 James Cleverly, the Liberal Democrats\u2019 Ed Davey, the SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford, and Brexit party candidate Richard Tice. Men-only Question Time panels are very rare and the BBC has made a concerted drive in recent years to increase the number of women appearing on its news and current affairs programme, with many programmes hitting the target of 50:50 representation following a staff-led effort to convince producers to push for equal on-air gender representation. It is the latest example of the BBC\u2019s editorial decisions coming under substantial scrutiny during this general election, prompting the director of news, Fran Unsworth, to write a defence of the corporation\u2019s impartiality for the Guardian. She said that given the scale of the BBC\u2019s output, some human mistakes are inevitable, adding: \u201cConspiracy theories are much in vogue these days. But we are a large organisation that employs thousands of independently minded journalists. Our editors employ their judgments on their own programmes for their own audiences. These aren\u2019t the ideal conditions for a conspiracy.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
