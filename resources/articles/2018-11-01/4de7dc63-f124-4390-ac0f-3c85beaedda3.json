In a bid to address concerns raised by campaigners, claimants and MPs, the work and pensions secretary, Esther McVey, announced a raft of changes on Monday to plans governing the transfer of 3 million people on to the new benefit. The so-called \u201cmanaged migration\u201d of universal credit claimants has become a major political concern, with two former prime ministers, John Major and Gordon Brown, joining MPs in warning that mishandling the process could trigger a poll tax-style revolt. Problems with universal credit, especially the long wait for a first benefit payment, have been identified as a key cause of hardship for claimants, with many forced to turn to food banks to survive and tens of thousands running up rent arrears. McVey\u2019s announcement followed a report by the government\u2019s social security advisory committee (SSAC) that warned of \u201csignificant concerns\u201d that the universal credit plans were rushed, too complex and placed too much risk on claimants. MPs will debate the migration regulations in the next few weeks. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has now said it accepts or will look again at 11 of the report\u2019s 12 recommendations for change. McVey told the Commons on Monday: \u201cWe will take a measured approach to delivering managed migration, taking our time to get it right and working with claimants to co-design it.\u201d The DWP has announced a number of measures as part of \u00a31bn package announced in the budget to help claimants\u2019 transition to universal credit, including providing two weeks\u2019 additional benefit to unemployed claimants to help them manage the five-week wait for a first UC payment. The SSAC report followed a consultation in which it received a record 455 responses, including more than 300 from individual claimants or their carers. It noted that it had been \u201cparticularly struck by the degree of anxiety\u201d about managed migration conveyed by this group. Sir Ian Diamond, the SSAC chair, said he was pleased that the government had largely accepted the committee\u2019s advice, but said much detail still had to be worked out. He said he was disappointed that the DWP had rejected a key recommendation to abandon plans to force all existing benefit claimants to make a claim for universal credit before they could be migrated to it. The DWP said making a new claim was essential to ensure all data was up to date. Campaigners, who have lobbied ministers hard to demand changes in recent months, welcomed McVey\u2019s announcement, but said the measures did not go far enough to limit the risk that thousands of vulnerable claimants could be left without benefit income. Frank Field, who chairs the Commons work and pensions select committee, said: \u201d[McVey] could not ignore the swell of expert voices warning that the government\u2019s approach to moving vulnerable people to universal credit could end in disaster and destitution. The department deserves credit for listening, but its response fails to provide in full the necessary safeguards for claimants.\u201d Alison Garnham, the chief executive of Child Poverty Action Group, said there was some good news in the revised regulations, but it was disappointing that the government rejected the argument for moving people on existing benefits over to universal credit automatically. Phillip Anderson, the head of policy at the MS Society, said: \u201cThe stop-start approach to managed migration remains a real concern. The government has said they will provide a one-off sum to help people manage, but this will not be enough. The best and only solution is for claimants to remain on their existing benefits until a universal credit claim is in place.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
