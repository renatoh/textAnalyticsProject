While the Scot maintains that the parting of ways with Vallverdu, who was part of the British No1\u2019s coaching team under Ivan Lendl, arose because they were not all \u201cpulling in the same direction\u201d, the Venezuelan sees things differently. \u201cTo be honest I don\u2019t know what he means by that, at least from my side,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t been involved with his conversations with Jez [Green, the also departed fitness coach] but it\u2019s pointless to talk about it now. Things are what they are, he is in a great place and I\u2019m pleased for him and that he has come back to the top of his game.\u201d Getting back to the top of his game has enabled Murray to set up Thursday\u2019s last-four meeting with Berdych, now Vallverdu\u2019s employer. The coach, though, does not think his knowledge of the Murray game will give Berdych any advantage on the Rod Laver Arena. \u201cIt\u2019s not rocket science,\u201d Vallverdu said. \u201cThey have played each other 10 times before and know each other pretty well. It\u2019s going to be more about Tomas worrying about what\u2019s going on on his side of the court and executing his game. It\u2019s not going to be that complicated, he knows what to do, we are on the same page. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s much of an advantage. \u201cI\u2019m sure I will see them in the locker room. Nothing will change, it\u2019s another tennis match, Andy and Tomas are the ones playing against each other. If at the start of the tournament you\u2019d asked Tomas or Andy if they\u2019d like to be in this situation they would have said: \u2018Yes.\u2019 They are both in a pretty good position, they are pretty pumped up about the match.\u201d Vallverdu said he has not seen much of Murray on the circuit since they split two months ago. \u201cHe was in Miami in the off-season, I was in the Czech Republic with Tomas, then we were at different tournaments, so we have different schedules. And we\u2019ve had different schedules here also. It\u2019s not really the time to be socialising. Everyone is doing their own thing. We will be seeing each other more after this. \u201cHe feels he is in a good place physically but he has always been fit, it has always been a strength of his. When he was winning slams and the Olympics he was as fit as anyone on the tour, so he\u2019s been very fit his whole career. \u201cLast year it was normal he might not have been as fit, he went through back surgery \u2013 that\u2019s normal that it takes a bit of time to get back to where you were physically before surgery. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as any different to where he was two or three years ago. I think he\u2019s at the same level when he was winning slams and I\u2019m happy for him to be back there. In my opinion, it has always been his strength.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
