But like its Nordic neighbours before it, open, prosperous, liberal, tolerant Sweden is in uncharted waters, facing a right-wing populist insurgency that \u2013 despite a performance it will view as disappointing \u2013 has now become a very real political force. Sooner or later \u2013 as happened, gradually, in Denmark, Norway and Finland \u2013 some kind of accommodation, from ad hoc parliamentary alliance to full-blown coalition government, looks inevitable. It may even be imminent. Formed in the late 1980s by neo-fascist extremists, the Sweden Democrats have leapt in the space of just three elections from a 5.7% share of the national vote in 2010, when they first entered parliament, to 12.9% in 2014 and 17.7% this year, according to official preliminary results. The irruption of the radical right party has upended perhaps western Europe\u2019s most stable political order. For decades, the same two established blocs defined Sweden\u2019s politics, coalescing more recently into a more formal four-party alliance led by the Moderates on the centre-right, and a Social Democrat-Green coalition \u2013 backed by the ex-communist Left party \u2013 on the centre-left. The rise of the populists, riding high on a raft of alternative political concerns \u2013 immigration, integration, identity, crime, welfare chauvinism \u2013 that cut across the traditional left-right divide, is forcing a wholesale realignment. The Sweden Democrats \u2013 until the 2015 migration crisis the only party to consistently and forcefully oppose immigration \u2013 have poached voters, leaving the Social Democrats with their worst score in a century, the Moderates well down on 2014, and their respective blocs with no hope of a parliamentary majority. They have also exposed deep divisions within the blocs \u2013 not least over how best to deal with the Sweden Democrats themselves. They may have rid themselves of most of their overtly racist elements and toned down many of their more extreme policies, but the anti-immigration party remains ostracised, for the time being, by every other. So where next? No one knows. For the moment, the non-cooperation pact holds. But many analysts \u2013 as well as the Social Democrat prime minister, Stefan Lofven \u2013 suspect that given the chance, the Moderates in particular may not wait too long to test it. \u201cThe cordon sanitaire is starting to fray,\u201d said Nicholas Aylott of S\u00f6dert\u00f6rn university. First, though, Sweden will go through a complicated, messy and potentially long-drawn out process of trying to form a new kind of government \u2013 across the traditional left-right divide. That could well prove too much to swallow, especially for the ex-communist Left party. A German-style \u201cgrand coalition\u201d between the main Social Democrats and Moderates is theoretically possible, if unlikely, since the Moderates\u2019 most burning ambition is to oust the Social Democrats. More probable seems another minority government, most likely by the centre-right. That is feasible because in order to rule, Swedish governments do not need to show they have a majority, merely that they do not have one against them: the new prime minister could end up simply being \u201cthe candidate parliamentarians dislike the least,\u201d according to Aylott. The result would be a potentially vulnerable government, but not necessarily an impotent or an ineffective one: Anders Sannerstadt, a political scientist at Lund university, cites research showing countries used to minority governments often fare better under them, perhaps because they demand pragmatic, cross-party agreements. But it would, necessarily, depend on the backing of the Sweden Democrats, whose potential to make or break a right-wing minority administration will be considerable. Nonetheless, no one sees Sweden descending into disorder. \u201cWe do not expect political chaos or gridlock,\u201d said Ana Andrade of the Economist Intelligence unit. \u201cSweden has a long history of consensus-based policymaking. The parties will find an agreement.\u201d But if the Sweden Democrats are formally frozen out of government this time, their gradual inclusion in Sweden\u2019s political process \u2013 beginning, almost certainly, with occasional parliamentary support for a minority centre-right government \u2013 now seems just a matter of time. \u201cIf things carry on as they are going, it will happen,\u201d said Ann-Cathrine Jungar, a far-right specialist at S\u00f6dert\u00f6rn university. \u201cIn Denmark, Norway, Austria, the far-right is now accepted by the centre-right. I can see that here.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
