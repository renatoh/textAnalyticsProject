Conservative, Labour, Lib Dem, Green party, Brexit party, independent or other \u2013 we will be scrutinising what all candidates for parliament are saying to test their veracity. We will be keeping an eye on contenders well-known or new to politics, from set-piece speeches to remarks made on the doorstep, from appearances on the Today programme to BBC Question Time and from pamphlets shoved through doors to posts on social media.

The Trust frees the Guardian from commercial or political interference \u2013 we don\u2019t have a wealthy owner pulling the strings, and any profits are reinvested into our journalism rather than into shareholders\u2019 pockets.
