The memo about leaking, which was leaked to Bloomberg and published on Friday, threatened employees with criminal consequences and shines a harsh light on the Silicon Valley company\u2019s aggressive surveillance of its own employees and intensive investigative efforts to catch and punish leakers. \u201cLast month, Apple caught and fired the employee responsible for leaking details from an internal, confidential meeting about Apple\u2019s software roadmap. Hundreds of software engineers were in attendance \u2026 One person betrayed their trust,\u201d the company reportedly wrote on its internal blog. \u201cThe employee who leaked the meeting to a reporter later told Apple investigators that he did it because he thought he wouldn\u2019t be discovered. But people who leak \u2013 whether they\u2019re Apple employees, contractors or suppliers \u2013 do get caught and they\u2019re getting caught faster than ever.\u201d The memo further warned workers to be wary of \u201cpress, analysts and bloggers\u201d who may \u201ctarget\u201d or \u201cbefriend\u201d them on social media: \u201cWhile it may seem flattering to be approached, it\u2019s important to remember that you\u2019re getting played \u2026 A scoop about an unreleased Apple product can generate massive traffic for a publication and financially benefit the blogger or reporter who broke it. But the Apple employee who leaks has everything to lose.\u201d The Guardian could not independently confirm the memo, and the company did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. The memo said \u201cleakers in the supply chain\u201d were also getting caught, adding: \u201cLeakers do not simply lose their jobs at Apple. In some cases, they face jail time and massive fines for network intrusion and theft of trade secrets both classified as federal crimes.\u201d The company did not provide details on the dozen arrests that it said took place last year, but said those included \u201cemployees, contractors and some partners in Apple\u2019s supply chain\u201d. The memo added: \u201cThese people not only lose their jobs, they can face extreme difficulty finding employment elsewhere.\u201d The memo was leaked at a time when Apple\u2019s CEO, Tim Cook, has been positioning his company as a more ethical tech firm compared with others in Silicon Valley. Last month, he issued a harsh rebuke of Mark Zuckerberg and the business model at Facebook, which is reeling from a major data privacy scandal. A recent Guardian investigation uncovered details of the so-called \u201crat-catching\u201d team at Facebook, which conducts surveillance on workers and fired one employee who leaked innocuous information to a reporter. Apple is notorious for its culture of secrecy and has reportedly made employees sign non-disclosure agreements specific to projects and used black cloths to cover unlaunched products."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
