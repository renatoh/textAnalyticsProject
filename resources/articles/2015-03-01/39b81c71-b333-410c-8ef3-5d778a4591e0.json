Porto had little option but to defeat Sporting Lisbon in the Primeira Liga\u2019s battle between second and third \u2013 and did so with an assuredness that suggests the four-point advantage held by Benfica can be chiselled away over the next 11 games. If the identity of their hat-trick scoring match-winner, the Barcelona loanee Cristian Tello, came as a surprise then the victory itself never seemed in doubt after an insipid Sporting side, who did not create a meaningful chance, was breached for the first time shortly after the half hour. A pre-match flag display depicted an athletic Porto fan jumping to claim the European Cup while a pot-bellied Sporting representative looked on. If it served as an apt enough commentary on the clubs\u2019 past and present continental endeavours \u2013 Porto hold an away-goal advantage in their Champions League tie with Basel, while Sporting were ejected from the Europa League by Wolfsburg on Thursday \u2013 there were fewer positive noises about the prospects of a similar feat domestically. Porto sat seven points behind leaders Benfica, 6-0 victors over Estoril on Saturday, at kick-off and the acceptance seemed universal that anything bar victory against Sporting, a further five points behind but unbeaten in 13 league games, would all but end hopes of taking the title back from Est\u00e1dio da Luz. A wet, foggy night and correspondingly slick surface demanded precision but it took 16 minutes of excessive enthusiasm to use the pitch\u2019s width before anything resembling an opportunity arose. In the event, it was from a position in the \u2018D\u2019 that Jackson Mart\u00ednez, Porto\u2019s top scorer, switched the ball on to his left foot and shot narrowly wide. Cohesion remained scarce, a fact perhaps unaided by the sense of urgency transmitted from the home support, whose tolerance for slow buildups from defence was thin and came close to snapping when the centre-back Maicon conceded possession with a slack pass across his back line. Something incisive was needed here and Evandro would have provided it but for a well-timed tackle in front of goal by Sporting\u2019s Adrien Silva. There was a clearer sight in the 31st minute when the Mexican midfielder H\u00e9ctor Herrera, appearing in the visitors\u2019 area for the first time, checked inside but, with time to pick his spot from a favourable angle on the right, floated his shot over. Any need to fret vanished within a minute. A mixture of questionable service and iffy control had resulted in Tello, who is in the first year of a two-season loan, making a limited impact on the right but, when Mart\u00ednez dropped deep and adjusted his body to catch Sporting\u2019s defence cold with a chest-high flick of the boot, he had a clear route to goal through the middle. He slotted confidently past Rui Patr\u00edcio, vindicating the crowd\u2019s impatience and celebrating his fourth goal since signing last July. Sporting had been anonymous in attack and it came as a jolt when the right-winger Andr\u00e9 Carrillo, the most involved of an anodyne bunch, shot wide. However, Porto could have extended their advantage before half-time when the by now influential Herrera released Tello with a first-time pass, only for the opportunity to be lost when the goalscorer opted to take on an extra man. The interval did little to check the momentum of Porto, who had been visibly transformed by the goal. Mart\u00ednez had just had a penalty appeal waved away when, set up by Tello on the six-yard line, he delayed a fraction of a second too long and allowed the right-back C\u00e9dric to intervene crucially. The combination would not be denied in the 58th minute, though, and again it was Mart\u00ednez providing the bullet for his less prolific colleague. This time a slide-rule pass through the inside-right channel exposed some woefully lopsided positioning from Sporting\u2019s back four, whose right-sided pairing was a good yard behind its left and played Tello onside. His finish, high this time, was emphatic. It had certainly not been the expected division of labour but Mart\u00ednez could have scored his 23rd goal of the season straight afterwards, instead shooting across goal. Sporting introduced Islam Slimani and Diego Capel, moving the willing but frustrated Nani into a central position \u2013 but to little gain. Instead it was Tello, this time making the most of a Herrera through-ball, who ran clear again to score a calmly taken third. There remained time for the Sporting defender Tobias Figueiredo to head against his own crossbar but the visitors had given themselves enough to be embarrassed by. \u2022 BT Sport shows multiple live games from Portugal\u2019s Primeira Liga every week as part of a European football lineup that includes Europa League, Germany\u2019s Bundesliga, France\u2019s Ligue 1 and Italy\u2019s Serie A."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
