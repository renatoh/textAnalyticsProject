America\u2019s S&amp;P 500 index has closed at a new alltime high, although today\u2019s rally did fade by the end of the session. Wall Street investors have given a steady thumbs-up to Saturday\u2019s news that China and the US will resume trade talks. Here\u2019s the closing prices: Dow Jones industrial average: up 111 points of 0.42% at 26,711 S&amp;P 500: up 22 points or 0.75% at 2,963.83 points Nasdaq: up 82.95 points or 1% at 8,089.19 Technology stocks led the way, on relief that America won\u2019t impose new tariffs on electronics goods made in China. Financial stocks also gained, along with consumer goods makers and miners (whose commodities should be in higher demand without a trade war). Goodnight! GW Michael Wilson, equity strategist at Morgan Stanley, has warned investors not to get carried away by the trade war ceasefire. As he points out in a note to clients, there are other problems on the horizon - including signs of slowing growth. Wilson explained: \u201cA pause in rising trade tensions is not a fix for slowing U.S. economic activity and earnings pressure. In November, a truce brought a short-lived rally to the S&amp;P, but ultimately induced procurement managers to cancel orders as inventories were already high and there was no longer an incentive to stockpile ahead of incremental tariffs.\u201d Marketwatch has more details. Today\u2019s weak factory PMI reports from across the globe show that global manufacturing contracted for the second consecutive month in June. Two months of contraction in global trade has not happened in six-and-a-half years, according to the J.P. Morgan Global Manufacturing Index, points out Bloomberg. More here. Our news story on today\u2019s market action is now live, here: Here are some photos of traders on the the floor of the New York stock exchange, as stocks hit record highs today. Back in London, City investors shrugged off today\u2019s weak factory data - taking comfort in the US-China trade detente. The FTSE 100 ended the session 71 points higher at 7,497, a gain of almost 1%. That\u2019s its highest close in over two months, going back to late April (before the May selloff). Other European markets had a good day, lifted by hopes that trade turmoil may be easing. Germany\u2019s DAX finished 1% higher at 12,521, up 122 points, while the French CAC gained 0.5%. This is not encouraging: There\u2019s a sharp contrast between the optimism in the markets, and the struggles in the world\u2019s factories shown in today\u2019s PMI data: Fawad Razaqzada, Market Analyst at Forex.com, suspects the rally may fade: The US-China trade optimism is driving the markets and the S&amp;P 500 has opened at a fresh record, while safe havens gold, yen and franc have all fallen. Tech stocks jumped after Trump said he would allow US corporations to resume business dealings with Huawei on certain products after it was blacklisted earlier due to national security concerns. But July has started with a negative note for global manufacturing data, after purchasing managers reported deteriorating conditions in several key economic regions including China and the US. Initially, this was shrugged off by a market buoyed by the latest developments regarding the US-China trade spat, after Trump said trade talks are back on track. However, since the start of the US session, we have seen a bit of a pullback from the highs. If this latest trade optimism fades completely, the focus will turn very quickly to the ailing global economy. As such, the S&amp;P\u2019s latest breakout to a new all-time high could be brief, especially as some of the positivity regarding trade talks was already priced in. Wall Street is holding most of its early gains, with graphics card and chipmaker Nvidia among the risers (+2.5%). A second survey of US manufacturing has confirmed that growth was subdued last month: Donald Trump\u2019s trade war has hurt US manufacturing, warns Markit\u2019s chief economist Chris Williamson. Here\u2019s his take on today\u2019s PMI survey, which is quite a contrast to the booming markets. Although business optimism about the future lifted slightly higher, it remained close to survey lows to indicate persistent low morale. Worries centred on signs of slowing demand both at home and internationally, weaker sales, and geopolitical uncertainty. \u201cTariffs meanwhile continued to push up prices, but weak demand often limited the ability of firms to pass higher prices onto customers, suggesting overall inflationary pressures have weakened compared to earlier in the year.\u201d Just in: America\u2019s manufacturing sector barely grew last month -- but that\u2019s still good by global standards! Data firm Markit has just reported that US factories remained in \u201cnear-stagnation\u201d in June, due to weak output and cautious hiring. Its US manufacturing PMI has come in at 50.6, up from 50.5 in May, but barely above the break-even point. Markit explains: The rate of overall growth held close to May\u2019s near-decade low. On a positive note, the rate of output growth quickened slightly amid a renewed rise in new orders. However, in line with muted increases in output, firms reined in staff hiring, expanding workforce numbers at the slowest pace for almost three years. Subsequently, output expectations remained subdued. So, a weak result, but much better than Britain\u2019s factories -- the UK PMI fell to just 48.0 earlier today. China\u2019s manufacturing also contracted, with a PMI of 49.4, while the eurozone limped in with just 47.6. America\u2019s technology-focused Nasdaq index is really on a charge -- up a beefy 1.7% at the start of trading. That reflects relief that Washington and Beijing have agreed to resume trade talks, as tech companies were vulnerable to tariffs and other sanctions. The Dow Jones industrial average has also jumped 1% at the start of trading, gaining 264 points to 26,864. Boom! The New York Stock Market has hit a fresh record high at the start of trading. Investors are relieved that Donald Trump and Xi Jinping backed away from a deeper trade war, agreeing to restart negotiations during their meeting at the G20 last week. With stocks surging, the S&amp;P 500 index has hit a new intraday record high - up 34 points or 1.1% at 2,975 in early trading. Technology stocks are among the top rises, after the US decided to relax some of the blacklist against China\u2019s Huawei. After a strong first half of the year, the markets have begun the second half powerfully too..... Here\u2019s another chart showing how the world\u2019s factories have slowed sharply in recent months, with many now contracting (with a PMI below 50). Shares in Apple are expected to rally today too, thanks to trade optimism. Soybean prices have hit a one-year high in Chicago, following the news that China and the US will restart trade talks. Donald Trump\u2019s pledge on Saturday that China has agreed to buy more American agricultural products is helping push prices up. China had been a top market for America\u2019s soybean farmers, but have been hit by rising tariffs since the trade dispute blew up last year. Today\u2019s PMI report shows that business optimism among factory bosses has dropped this month, dragged down by \u201cBrexit uncertainty and softer global and domestic economic growth\u201d. As such, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt\u2019s pledges that they\u2019re prepared to take Britain out of the EU without a deal on 31 October aren\u2019t helping. Seamus Nevin, the chief economist at manufacturers\u2019 group Make, has warned: \u201cGiven this outlook, increasing competition to see who can race to the bottom and act tough on \u2018no deal\u2019 is the height of irresponsibility with zero understanding of the consequences.\u201d Rebecca Long Bailey MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Business Secretary, has blamed the government\u2019s mismanagement of Brexit for the slump in factory growth. She says: \u201cThe Government\u2019s mishandling of Brexit, and above all the reckless threat of No Deal, has pushed UK manufacturing to a six year low, with consecutive months of falling production. Only Labour will deliver a comprehensive Industrial Strategy and the long-term investment needed to revitalise the UK\u2019s manufacturing base.\u201d The UK chancellor, meanwhile, has been busy reminding certain colleagues that they\u2019ll struggle to fund their spending pledges if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal: That firepower is the \u00a327bn of extra money that Britain could borrow, without breaking budget targets. The stock market rally has now driven the UK\u201ds FTSE 100 index up by exactly one hundred points, or 1.35%, to 7,525 points. That\u2019s its highest level in nearly 10 weeks, as the threat of a deeper US-China trade war fades. Britain isn\u2019t the only country whose manufacturing sector has weakened in recent months. As this tweet shows, most factory PMIs have fallen in recent months -- as bosses have reported slowing output and order growth. Those in red are now below the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction: Wall Street could hit a fresh record high today -- which I\u2019m sure Donald Trump would hail as a sign of progress on his watch. The US stock market is expected to cheer the US-China trade truce when it opens, in just over three hours time. The Dow Jones industrial average is tipped to gain around 250 point, or 1%, following the strong gains in Europe and Asia (where Japan and China\u2019s markets both gained over 2%). Several experts are warning that the prolonged period of uncertainty over the UK\u2019s exit from the European Union dragged the factory sector down last month. Seamus Nevin, Chief Economist at Make UK, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, says: \u201cToday\u2019s data proves that May\u2019s plunge below the 50-threshold was not just a one-off with UK manufacturing activity collapsing to its lowest level in six and a half years. Businesses are cutting back on both day-to-day and capital spending with the contraction in output a reflection of growing Brexit uncertainty and, worsening global trade winds. Lee Collinson, Head of Manufacturing at Barclays, says politicians need to help: Not only have manufacturers had to grapple with a prolonged period of uncertainty around Brexit, which has clearly impacted and delayed much needed investment decisions, but they also find themselves in the crosswinds of weakening demand from both home and overseas markets. With production and new order flows falling last month, the sector is increasingly looking to Westminster for the clarity they crave on the future relationship with the EU.\u201d Justin Benson, UK Head of Automotive at KPMG, is also concerned -- as both candidates to replace Theresa May say they could take Britain out without a deal. \u201cThe UK\u2019s manufacturing sector is experiencing historic lows in investment. New products and ideas are not being invested in to the extent that they were three years ago. The highs the sector saw in the first quarter of 2019 were clearly to mitigate Brexit issues, with many stockpiling to avoid or reduce delays to lead times and to manage customer expectations. \u201cRight now UK manufacturers need certainty, however, at the moment there\u2019s a high probability of a no-deal Brexit. The UK\u2019s makers need to start preparing for this eventuality, if they haven\u2019t done so already.\u201d Eurozone government bonds are also strengthening today, as relieved investors drive asset prices higher following the US-China trade truce. This is driving prices higher, pushing down the yield (or interest rate) on the bonds. Italy, for example, can now borrow for 10 years at just 2%, for the first time in over a year. Britain\u2019s stock market is continuing to rally, despite the decline in factory output last month. The FTSE 100 is holding firmly onto this morning\u2019s two-month high, currently up 82 points at 7,508 points. Nearly every sector is posting gains -- partly helped by the weaker pound (which boosts overseas earnings). Fiona Cincotta, senior market analyst at City index, says investors are optimistic following the G20 meeting. The much anticipated Trump-Xi Jinping meeting in Osaka delivered as expected, not a full on resolution of the trade dispute between China and the US but some form of truce that includes picking up the broken off trade negotiations between the two countries. For the time being the existing import tariffs will remain in place but the markets will live off the hope that the resumption of the discussions between US and Chinese trade representatives will help lift those sooner rather than later. Better news: Unemployment across the eurozone has hit a fresh 11 year low, dropping to 7.5% in May. Statistics body Eurostat also reports that jobless levels fell in almost every member of the EU (only Denmark saw an increase, from 5% to 5.1%). But there are still sharp differences across the EU - with Germany boasting just 3.1% unemployment, while it\u2019s still over 18% in Greece. The decline in UK factory output in June has driven the pound down to a 10-day low. Sterling has shed half a cent against the US dollar to $1.2639, its weakest point since 20 June. In another worrying sign, UK consumer credit growth has slowed to a five-year low. The Bank of England reports that unsecured lending to consumers only grew by 5.6% per year in May, down from 5.9% in April Mortgage approvals also fell, from 66,045 to 65,409, suggesting the public are being cautious. That, combined with the decline in factory output, suggests Britain\u2019s economy has weakening in the last few weeks. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, says Brexit is hurting UK factories for two reasons: a) panicky stockpiling earlier this year has brought forward demand b) Anxiety over a no-deal crisis this autumn is making clients nervous. Dobson says this helped to drag the factory PMI to its lowest in over six years: \u201cThe downturn in UK manufacturing deepened during June, as the impact of firms unwinding stockpiles built before the original Brexit date continued to reverberate through the sector and exacerbate weak demand. \u201cThe stranglehold of sustained Brexit-related uncertainty and disruption also weighed heavily on business confidence and employment, as optimism ebbed to one of its lowest levels in the survey history and staff headcounts were reduced for the third straight month. Worryingly, UK factories don\u2019t have enough orders to help them quickly plough through their inventory stocks. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s factory sector has suffered its sharpest contraction in six years. Data firm Markit\u2019s UK manufacturing PMI, just released, is much worse than expected. The index has slumped to just 48.0, a 76-month low, showing that the sector shrank at a more rapid pace. Companies reported that output and new orders both slumped in June, hitting business confidence. One problem is that firms are now cutting their stockpiles, having furiously bought raw materials and parts earlier this year in case of a no-deal Brexit. Markit says that Britain\u2019s manufacturing downturn has deepened, as the UK PMI falls to lowest level since February 2013. It explains: The UK manufacturing sector continued to feel the reverberations of the unwinding of earlier pre-Brexit stockpiling activity during June. The already high stock levels at both manufacturers and their clients led to a scaling back of output and new order intakes, with demand from both domestic and export markets weakening. Output was lowered in response to reduced intakes of new business, which fell to the greatest extent for almost seven years. There were reports that high stock levels, ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the economic slowdown and rising competition all contributed to the decreases in new orders and production. More to follow..... Some City experts are sceptical about quite how much progress was made between the US and China at the G20 summit. Although Donald Trump talked up his meeting with Xi Jinping as a big success, we still don\u2019t know how Beijing and Washington will resolve their trade conflict. The two sides also haven\u2019t set any public deadlines. Russ Mould, investment director at stockbrokers AJ Bell, says: The fact that China and the US are restarting trade talks gives some reassurance to investors and triggers a small rally in stocks around the world. However, there are plenty of other negative factors to consider which explains why equity markets aren\u2019t experiencing massive surges. \u201cThe trade war is far from over, which means a continuation of uncertainties hanging over the market. Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments, is also cautious about the G20 summit, saying: \u201cIn the big picture, it doesn\u2019t change anything. It was never likely to solve the whole problem, but it\u2019s a useful stepping stone.\u201d Ditto Chris Bailey, analyst at investment bank Raymond James: \u201cSo the can was kicked down the road... but [there is] much more work to do on the details of a future stickable agreement,\u201d Economics professor Nouriel Roubini is concerned by the eurozone factory downturn: Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, sounds just as downbeat: \u201cEurozone manufacturing remained stuck firmly in a steep downturn in June, continuing to contract at one of the steepest rates seen for over six years..... The downturn is also showing no signs of any imminent end. The survey\u2019s forward-looking indicators remained worryingly subdued in June, adding to concerns about the economy in the second half of the year.\u201d Newsflash: Europe\u2019s factory sector continued to contract last month, taking the shine off today\u2019s market rally. Data firm Markir reports that its Eurozone manufacturing PMI report, which tracks thousands of firms, fell to a three-month low of 47.6 in June, from 47.7 in May. That shows that the sector kept shrinking, at a slightly faster rate. It\u2019s the fifth month in a row in which the manufacturing PMI has failed to hit the 50-point mark (which split expansion from contraction). Companies reported that output and new orders continued to shrink last month - a sign of weak economic demand. That could be partly due to the US-China trade tensions. Markit reports that Germany suffered the worst slowdown while France\u2019s economy picked up: Ouch! Spain\u2019s factory sector suffered a sharp contraction last month, with orders and output dropping. Data firm Markit blames \u201cdeteriorating market conditions, both at home and abroad\u201d -- a sign that the eurozone slowdown, and months of trade tensions, are hurting. Every European stock index has surged higher this morning, following the rally in Asia overnight. July is off to a \u201cflying start\u201d, says Connor Campbell of Spreadex. Though they have been here before, the global markets proved ready and willing to swallow the latest trade war retreat from the USA and China. The much-anticipated G20-sidebar between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping didn\u2019t disappoint. According to the US President trade negotiations are now \u2018right back on track\u2019, Trump then pledging that he won\u2019t be adding additional tariffs onto Chinese goods \u2013 \u2018for the time being\u2019. Xi, meanwhile, called for \u2018cooperation and dialogue\u2019, the Beijing leader no doubt keen to get talks up and running given Monday\u2019s Caixin manufacturing PMI unexpectedly contracted. The Stoxx 600 tech index, which tracks Europe\u2019s technology sector, has jumped 2.2% this morning to its highest level in more than a year. European stocks are also surging in early trading. Germany\u2019s DAX index, which is stocked with major exporters, has leapt by 1.8% to its highest level since August 2018. Boom! Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index has hit its highest level in over two months, at the start of trading in London. The index of top blue-chip shares has gained 75 points, or over 1%, to 7,500 points -- its highest level since 24th April. Almost every stock on the index is higher, with financial stocks, technology firms, industrial groups, energy providers and miners leading the way. Traders are racing to buy shares, relieved that America and China have agreed to resume trade negotiations over the weekend. Investment bank Jefferies agree that the cessation of US-China trade hostilities should be taken well by markets: For investors sipping their Sunday morning coffee and perusing the weekend newspapers, the 180-degree tilt in US-North Korea relations probably edged out the 45-degree turn in US-China trade relations in terms of attention. The fact that President Trump announced that he would not be adding tariffs on US$300bn worth of Chinese imports and that trade talks would resume will be a relief for financial markets. The surprising U-turn that US companies will be able to continue to sell to Huawei has been regarded as a significant concession. The trade truce can\u2019t come soon enough for China\u2019s factories, who have suffered falling orders and output in June. Manufacturing production across China slumped into contraction last month, according to the latest survey of purchasing managers across country. The Caixin China General Manufacturing PMI fell from 50.2 in May to 49.4 in June, below the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction. It\u2019s the second lowest reading since June 2016. Firms reported that: Output and new work intakes decline for first time since January There was a renewed reduction in export sales Goods producers cutback input purchasing and payroll numbers Caixin says Jone was a \u201cchallenging month for Chinese manufacturers\u201d, with trade tensions driving down sales, export orders, and production levels. Companies responded by reducing headcounts further and making fewer purchases of raw materials and semi-finished items. At the same time, selling prices were raised following another increase in input costs, though rates of inflation were negligible. Business sentiment was broadly neutral at the end of the second quarter, with firms mainly concerned about the US-China trade dispute. Robin Bew of the Economist Intelligence Unit doesn\u2019t believe the US-China ceasefire will hold for very long, given the underlying tensions between the two sides. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, predicts that the trade war ceasefire could last for several months. \u201cWe expect talks to continue over the coming months, with the most likely outcome \u2013 as we previously expected \u2013 a prolonged truce on trade. Both sides have strong incentives to avoid further rounds of retaliation. However, we also believe neither side is in a rush for a deal. Both Presidents Trump and Xi appear to be calculating that they have strong cards to play.\u201d Japan\u2019s Nikkei index has closed at a two-month high, driven by optimism over the US-China trade truce. President Trump\u2019s decision to ease restrictions on Huawei has boosted tech stocks, amid a general burst of optimism. Here\u2019s some latest prices: Japan\u2019s Nikkei: up 454 points or 2.1% at 21,729.97 points China\u2019s CSI 300: up 108 points or 2.8% at 3,933 points Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200: up 29 points or 0.44% at 6,684 points Stephen Innes of Vanguard Markets says: After spending the better part of two months in trade war purgatory and with G20 done and dusted, risk markets have responded to Saturday\u2019s events in a reveller tone. Indeed, investors heaved a massive, but exhausted, sigh of relief that both the U.S. and China opted to push the reset button and restart trade negotiations amidst other pleasantries \u2013 now we\u2019ll have to see, whether it all sticks. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Relief is sweeping the financial world this morning after the US and China agreed to restart trade talks, calming fears of a full-blown trade war. Investors are welcoming the news that Trump and Xi\u2019s meeting at the G20 in Osaka, Japan, appeared to go well. Share prices are romping higher, on hopes that further conflict can be avoided. The two leaders gave the green light to fresh trade negotiations, with America pledging not to put any more tariffs on Chinese goods in the meantime. In return, apparently, Beijing will buy more US agricultural goods. Trump declared that the relationship with China was \u201cright back on track\u201d after an \u201cexcellent\u201d meeting. He told reporters: \u201cWe will continue to negotiate, and I promise that at least for the time being we won\u2019t be adding additional [tariffs]. We\u2019re going to work with China to see if we can make a deal. China will consult with us and will be buying a tremendous amount of food and agricultural products, and they\u2019re going to start doing that almost immediately.\u201d Trump has also relaxed some of the measures recently imposed on Huawei, by allowing US companies to sell some technology to the Chinese telecoms firm. This move has angered some hawkish US politicians, who believe Huawei is a security threat. The truce is sparking a risk-on fever in the markets this morning, driving up asset prices. Asian stock markets are higher, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei up over 2% and China\u2019s CSI 300 gaining 2.5%. European stock markets are tipped to rally when trading being -- the FTSE 100 is expected to gain 58 points, or 0.9%, while Germany\u2019s DAX could gain almost 1.5%. But.... traders should remember that we don\u2019t yet have a comprehensive trade deal between the US and China. Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada explains: The compromise reached between Trump and Xi at the week\u2019s G20 meeting went further than most had expected, with Trump putting the next tranche of tariffs on hold and reopening US companies\u2019 ability to supply Huawei. It is not clear, however, whether the latter will clear congress and there is plenty of scope for trade talks to break down again in the future. For now, however, risk is well supported. Also coming up today Data firm Markit is publishing its latest Purchasing Manager Index reports, showing how the world\u2019s manufacturers performed in June. Economists predict that Britain\u2019s factory sector shrank slightly, as the Brexit stockpiling rush earlier this year continues to fade. Europe\u2019s manufacturing base probably suffered a sharper decline, while America\u2019s industrial sector may have stalled again. Some top central bankers are gathered in Helsinki for a conference organised by the Bank of Finland, including Federal Reserve policymaker Richard Clarida and China\u2019s top central banker Yi Gang.
