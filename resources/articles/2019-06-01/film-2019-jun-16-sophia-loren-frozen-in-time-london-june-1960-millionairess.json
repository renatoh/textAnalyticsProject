The theft layered drama on drama. Loren was 25 at the time, and starring with Peter Sellers, who left his wife and two children citing his love for her, despite their affair being no more than a \u201cdelusional fantasy\u201d, or what today would be called \u201cstalking\u201d. His five-year-old daughter asked Sellers if he still loved them. He replied: \u201cOf course I do, darling, just not as much as Sophia Loren.\u201d \u201cHunger was the major theme of my childhood,\u201d Loren later wrote. In the 1940s her mother begged on the streets for food; when an American soldier gave some chocolate to Loren, she didn\u2019t know what it was. During pregnancy, Loren started making recipe notes, drawing on her famous passion for food (\u201cEverything you see I owe to spaghetti\u201d) to create a \u201cgastronomic autobiography\u201d. Eat With Me was published in the UK in 1972, and is a collection of Italian antipasti and glamorous full-page portraits of Loren. \u201cStraddling a 5ft display of p\u00e2t\u00e9 while simultaneously patting the heads of two live pheasants,\u201d wrote food historian Polly Russell in the Financial Times, \u201cLoren, cook-housewife-goddess, triumphs.\u201d Russell\u2019s descriptions suggest Loren\u2019s well-broadcast passion for food was less about the food and more a way of solidifying her image as passionate. Hungry. \u201cThe presentation of Loren as desiring and desirable are reminders that to be a woman is a part to be played \u2013 something that Nigella Lawson, with an ironic, feminist wink would later come to embody as the nation\u2019s \u2018domestic goddess\u2019. Eat With Me was a taste of what was to come.\u201d The impact of Loren\u2019s recipe books was far outweighed by the impact of her photoshoots with food \u2013 sausages, a flying disc of dough, these whelks on the Millionairess set. After the film\u2019s success, Loren and Sellers recorded a single called Bangers and Mash. He sang the part of a Cockney man distraught at his Italian wife\u2019s insistence on cooking such muck as tagliatelle. \u201cI met her down in Napoli and didn\u2019t she look great. And so I brought her back to Blighty just to show me mates. And though we\u2019re married happily, I\u2019ll tell you furthermore, I haven\u2019t had a decent meal since 1944.\u201d Loren is a great actress, but here, you can hear her patience running out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
