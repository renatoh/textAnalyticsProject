Following Henry's departure to Wales from Auckland Blues and the national A side the New Zealand Rugby Football Union changed its constitution to bar any coach who had worked abroad from taking charge of the All Blacks, a knee-jerk attempt to prevent other countries from milking the cream of their coaching talent. The \"Henry clause\" was quickly, and quietly, repealed and Henry finally fulfilled his dream of becoming All Blacks coach last December. Since then he has overseen four convincing wins, including two over England, and this morning he takes charge of his first Tri-Nations match, against Australia in Wellington. \"When I left for Wales, I knew my chances of coaching the All Blacks were minuscule but I had been offered something that was a privilege and gave me the chance to become a better coach,\" said Henry this week. \"I never had any cause to regret my decision, even when the Henry clause was written, but I am now where I always wanted to be.\" Henry signed a five-year contract with the WRU worth \u00a31.25m but he left 18 months before its end, shattered after a series of upheavals and, at the age of 56, facing an uncertain future. The early promise - Wales won 10 consecutive internationals in 1999, their best run for more than 90 years - had faded into the mediocrity of previous seasons. His reputation was further bruised after the Lions tour to Australia in 2001 and a home defeat by Argentina and a 50-point reverse in Dublin prompted him to resign. Henry was a controversial choice to coach the Lions, the first person who was not British or Irish to do so. His successor, Sir Clive Woodward, who was not just overlooked in 2001 but ignored, wasted no opportunity this month to criticise aspects of the 2001 tour. \"I have not read much about what he said\" was Henry's response. \"I have had other things on my mind. I am sure that Clive is looking forward to the task and he will have a nucleus of players to choose from, spread around the four home unions. We tried to mix and match in 2001 to find our best team and we just missed out on being successful. You learn from other people's situations and I guess that is what Clive is up to.\" Henry scored an early strike against Woodward last month, when the All Blacks comfortably secured the two-Test series against England, but he feels that he starts earning his money against Australia today. \"England did not have their best team out in either Test and a number of their guys were feeling the effects of a hard year,\" he said. \"Friendlies between northern and southern hemisphere sides do not prove much because one set of players are knackered. We need a global season because at the moment the team which has the advantage of playing at home is also the fresher one.\" With Henry's contract ending next year, his prospect of leading the All Blacks to the next World Cup hinge on the next two Tri-Nations as well as the Lions tour. \"Coaching New Zealand is totally different to Wales,\" he said. \"The system here prepares young players better and they are more readily able to break into the senior game. The end of grammar schools in Wales created a void but the players I had there all worked incredibly hard: I just had to get to know them all. \"But to experience the Six Nations, with all its tradition and close rivalry which the Tri-Nations does not have, was special.\" Henry has added some mongrel to the New Zealand pack in Jono Gibbes and Keith Robinson while he has encouraged the outside-half Carlos Spencer to become more pragmatic. He is also more quotable than his predecessor John Mitchell, sparking some feisty exchanges with his opposite number Eddie Jones this week. \"The Wallabies are a totally different proposition from the World Cup, much better behind,\" said Henry. The war of words next year promises to be as keenly fought as the Test series itself."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
