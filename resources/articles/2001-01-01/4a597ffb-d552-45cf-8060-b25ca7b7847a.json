Leading opposition politicians are demanding that the charismatic Green party chief step down. Mr Fischer said he wanted to make \"an apology for the wrongdoing to others\" he had perpetrated in his streetfighting days when he was a young leftwing militant. Photos published by Stern magazine and the tabloid daily Bild Zeitung showed him apparently luring a riot policeman into a violent ambush. The pictures were supplied to the papers by Bettina R\u00f6hl, whose mother was the terrorist leader Ulrike Meinhof. In a message posted on her personal website yesterday, Ms R\u00f6hl said she intended to follow up the publication of the photographs with the release of additional, allegedly compromising, material. The street clash \"will become sort of uncomfortable for its hero when I soon publish the Super 8 movie and other material which comes with it and which is complementary to the photos\", she said. Her message, written in lengthy, winding sentences, was shot through with bitterness towards Mr Fischer, whom she accused of trying to cover up his past on the far left. The foreign minister's record is soon to come under closer scrutiny than ever before. He has been summoned to give evidence later this month at the trial on terrorist charges of a former friend, Hans Joachim Klein. Ms R\u00f6hl claimed yesterday that he was one of the other attackers shown in the photographs. Mr Klein is accused of taking part in the mass kidnapping of Opec oil ministers in Vienna. in 1975. Stern said the photographs of the demonstration were taken in 1973 - two years earlier. Ms R\u00f6hl discovered the pictures while researching a book to be published later this year. The conservative daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said last night that they had been taken by a staff photographer and had lain in the paper's archives for 28 years. Ms R\u00f6hl's mother, one of two leaders of the infamous Baader-Meinhof Gang, committed suicide in prison in 1976. Mr Fischer, on the other hand, renounced violence and moved gradually into the political mainstream. Three years ago, he was named foreign minister after the Greens struck a coalition deal with Gerhard Schr\u00f6der's Social Democrats. Though outside Germany he has recently became a hate figure for the right, because of his espousal of a federal Europe, inside Germany Mr Fischer is just as much of a hate figure for the left, who accuse him of betraying his radical principles. In 1999, after he sided with Nato's bombing campaign against Yugoslavia, Mr Fischer suffered a burst eardrum when an enraged fellow-Green hurled a paint bomb at him. His role in radical far-left politics and among squatters in Frankfurt, where he was a student, has long been known. But he had rarely spoken in detail about it before talking to Stern's interviewers. \"We squatted houses and when they were supposed to be cleared we defended ourselves,\" he said. \"We threw stones. We were beaten up but we also fought back strongly.\" He added: \"Yes, I was militant. But I always rejected the armed struggle and fought it politically\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
