The gallant British contenders, as well as the Irish and Italians, are refusing to panic but the majority already seem braced for a sustained rearguard battle. Such is the ominous confidence and rising power of the leading French clubs it would be no surprise if they topped at least four of the tournament's six pools. Consequently it will take something truly extraordinary for an English side to become the sixth Premiership winner in 11 years to be crowned European champions. Five of the six most recent finalists have been French and next May's final in Cardiff could easily be another Francophile's delight. For a further dose of realism, it is worth listening to the Llanelli Scarlets' coach Gareth Jenkins. \"The French clubs have decided to adapt to the different conditions of the Heineken Cup - different grounds, playing conditions and referees. They have wised up abroad. \"Initially the style and intensity of French Championship rugby was beyond us. It was a pretty loose and reactive game that we couldn't get to grips with. Then we started to realise that by playing a limited game we could frustrate them. It worked for a while but now the French are playing Heineken Cup rugby better than anyone else.\" The challenge for Jenkins and his English counterparts, therefore, is to outwit the French either by playing smarter or by catching them napping early on. Leicester, for example, no longer have Martin Johnson or Neil Back and neither of their top props Julian White and Graham Rowntree is available initially. They are going to struggle to dominate opponents as they once did, particularly if they cannot get a grip in their opening two pool games against Clermont Auvergne and Stade Fran\u00e7ais. Wasps, similarly, will be on the back foot immediately should they lose either of their first two games, away to in-form Edinburgh and at home to the defending champions Toulouse. Hiding-places in Europe used to be rare; these days they are non-existent. For Leeds, bumping along at the bottom of the Premiership table, even the Italian champions Calvisano cannot be taken for granted. Saracens and Thomas Castaign\u00e8de, in front of the watching French coach Bernard Laporte, need to beat the brilliant Basques of Biarritz in Watford this Sunday to stand a serious chance of progressing. Bath, for their part, are once again in the same pool as Leinster and Bourgoin but should guard against dangerous preconceptions. Bourgoin average more than 36 points per home game in the French championship this season and will not treat Europe with the same shameful disregard as last time. Similar misgivings exist across Wales, Ireland and Scotland, although Cardiff have more depth to their squad and appear a decent outside bet to reach the last eight with or without assistance from their imminent new arrival Jonah Lomu. Munster, in contrast, do not look quite the same doughty force and find themselves occupying the same pool as the tournament's most strapping dark horses. That team are Sale who, with Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9 at the helm, have even less reason to feel inferior to their Gallic cousins. They start at home to Munster tonight in a game which contains all the ingredients to launch the competition in style, not least the question of how John Hayes will cope with the scrummaging strength of Andrew Sheridan. \"We worked hard all of last season to get into the Heineken Cup and we are not going to waste that effort,\" said Kingsley Jones, Saint-Andr\u00e9's assistant. Potentially at least, the Sharks have the personnel to be another Munster: tough up front and resourceful behind. If Charlie Hodgson pulls the strings as expertly as Ronan O'Gara, even a dangerous-looking Castres side may be subdued. But reaching the knock-out stages is one thing; winning the tournament is something else again. Without Cl\u00e9ment Poitrenaud's howler at Twickenham two years ago, the French aristocrats would have reigned supreme in Europe for the past three years. For that reason alone Toulouse remain the team to beat, closely followed by Stade Fran\u00e7ais and Biarritz, unless the home guard somehow prevails."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
