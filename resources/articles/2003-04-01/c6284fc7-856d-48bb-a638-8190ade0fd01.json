At least, this is what I was once told by a courteous Chinese guide, who might just have been making the round-eyes feel at peace with themselves about their cack-handed chopstick technique. The same principle applies - without any shadow of ambiguity - to cookbooks. The more decorated their pages are with stove-splash, peel-drip, edible Rorschach stains, oil starbursts, beetroot thumbprints and general incoherent dribblings, the more you have honoured them. By this token - and also by normal rational deduction - my favourite cookery text is Jane Grigson's Vegetable Book. To be sure, there are some lively blackcurrant markings in her Fruit Book, some lemon blobs and discarded pin-bones in her Fish Cookery; but the Vegetable Book bears the marks of long-term and heroic kitchen carnage. It also bears that other sign of popularity: the insertion of so many newspaper clippings that the book bulges out wider than its own spine. They are there for the simple reason that when Cabbage or Beetroot or Parsnips come to mind, the arm reaches automatically for Grigson, which becomes the obvious repository for the other people's recipes on the same subject. Unless a cookbook is nothing more than a collection of plagiarisms, a sense of its author's personality will inevitably come through. Sometimes this is a mistake - that personality may be authoritarian, snobbish, effete, dull. The author, for all their technical expertise in understanding ingredients, may not have a clue about what is going on inside the human beings who buy and use their book. Anthony Lane, reviewing the scarily efficient Martha Stewart, quotes this typical piece of advice about having folks round for a bite: \"One of the most important moments on which to expend extra effort is the beginning of a party, often an awkward time, when guests feel tentative and insecure.\" To which Lane exactly responds: \"The guests are insecure? How about the frigging cook?\" There is no such cult of personality in Grigson: rather, her presence suffuses her writing like some familiar and warming herb in a stew. You are constantly aware of it, the stew couldn't have been made without it, yet you don't keep having to pick it out from between your teeth. Her authorial mode is that of a very well-informed friend who has confidence in your ability at the stove. She is historical, anecdotal, personal where it is relevant - recalling, for instance, her grandmother's belief that peeled cucumbers were great provokers of wind - but mainly she subsumes herself into her subject. She is scholarly without being dry, generous without being subservient. Some cookery writers will brazenly present a book of recipes as if they had all been invented from scratch in the immediate time before publication; Grigson both cites and celebrates original sources and other people's recipes. Some cookery writers are smugly contemporary, exuding a sense of superiority to the old days, when they knew less and had fewer ingredients; Grigson regards the present not as the culminating point on an ever-rising curve of technology and nous, but as one moment in an ancient and continuing process. Indeed, we are in many ways less sophisticated and less successful cooks than previous generations. Machinery has made us lazy; the acceleration of life has made us impatient; air freight and the deep freeze have thinned our sense of the seasons; while the easy availability of foreign produce makes us disdain our own. Seakale was a particular point of reference for Grigson: why do we chase after cavolo nero when seakale - grown by Thomas Jefferson, compared by Car\u00eame to celery and asparagus - is forgotten? Grigson's scholarship was considerable but unostentatious. Here she is on cabbage: \"It is easy to grow, a useful source of greenery for much of the year. Yet as a vegetable it has original sin, and needs improvement. It can smell foul in the pot, linger through the house with pertinacity, and ruin a meal with its wet flab. Cabbage also has a nasty history of being good for you. Read Pliny, if you do not believe me.\" We do, of course, believe her, but her mode of expression also convinces us that it might be fun to look up Pliny. Further on in her introduction to Cabbage lies a story about Descartes. A \"lively Marquise\", who shared the common presumption that high thinking should be matched by austere living, once came across the philosopher tucking into more than was necessary to keep a hermit alive. When she expressed her surprise, Descartes responded, \"Do you think that God made good things only for fools?\" This story, which Grigson clearly found emblematic, gave her the title for her collection Good Things. Her reassurance that the past is constantly alive encouraged me to cook dishes that otherwise I wouldn't have attempted, like Toulouse-Lautrec's Gratin of Pumpkin. This didn't quite pan out, though at least it confirmed that Lautrec had a great sense of colour. On the other hand, Montaigne's Potatoes Cooked with Pears, a dish the essayist discovered on his way through Switzerland to Italy in 1580 (and which goes sweetly with ham), aptly confirms that while our eating habits have changed, the structure of our palates hasn't. Jane Grigson was married to Geoffrey Grigson, who for decades was the most caustic and dismissive literary critic in the country; so - on the page, anyway - they represented a Jack and Mrs Sprat of temperaments. Not that Jane Grigson was a food luvvie - her views were always very clear, never soggy. She knew what she didn't like, and what didn't work. Wild cabbage is \"very nasty indeed\"; most English turnips are only \"suitable for the over-wintering of herds, schoolchildren, prisoners and lodgers\". She is also very sound on swede. At times, though, her natural benignity verged on utopianism. Here she imagines the British nation enthusiastically going back to vegetable growing, wherever they might live. \"Now we might extend the picture to include high-rise blocks, patched with vegetation on every balcony - Marmande and plum tomatoes in pots, herbs in window-boxes, courgettes and squashes trailing round the doors. Inside, there could be aubergine, pepper, chilli and basil plants on the window sill, jars of sprouting seeds, dishes of mustard and cress, with mushroom buckets and blanching chicory in the dark broom and airing cupboards.\" It has to be said that, 25 years on from these words, the main problems of inner-city estates do not come from noxious whiffs of thyme and basil, or from old ladies tripping over trailing courgettes on walkways. But perhaps cookery writers tend by nature to be optimists. (Imagine a cookbook written by a confirmed grouch: \"Well, I shouldn't think this will work, and it'll probably taste vile, but you might, if you can be bothered...\"). Jane Grigson was not just a Good Thing herself, she was exemplary. Her Vegetable Book is prefaced by a quote from Robert Louis Stevenson: \"Every book is, in an intimate sense, a circular letter to the friends of him who writes it.\" Yes: but the best books persuade readers who do not even know the author that they are friends of hers too. \u00a9 Julian Barnes"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
