The club face two charges of failing to control their supporters on September 16. The FA has wide-ranging powers of punishment but the club's chairman David Gold said last night that he was resigned to a financial penalty. The first top-flight meeting of the derby rivals in 16 years was marred by celebratory invasions each time Birmingham scored in a 3-0 victory. The referee David Elleray put these down to high spirits in his match report but Gold accepted that the incident involving one supporter and the Aston Villa goalkeeper Peter Enckelman has probably counted against Birmingham. The culprit, identified by police and who will be banned for life from St Andrews, clipped the goalkeeper on the ear after his error had cost Villa a second goal. \"I am stunned and very disappointed,\" said Gold. \"I hoped that the FA would take a lenient view as there were only a handful of people involved on each occasion. But I suppose the incident involving one supporter and the goalkeeper has forced them to bring the charges. I expect we will be fined for it.\" Birmingham have 14 days in which to answer the charges but Gold is at a loss as to how to combat such incidents without restoring perimeter fences. The FA is likely to take into account other pitch invasions by Birmingham fans. One occurred two years ago when City defeated Ipswich to qualify for the Worthington Cup final, followed at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium last season when post-match presentations at the promotion play-off final were delayed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
