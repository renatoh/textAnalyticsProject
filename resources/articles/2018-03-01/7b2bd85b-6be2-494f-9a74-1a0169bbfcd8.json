I am in the mountain village of Sella, in Spain\u2019s Alicante province, enjoying a sneak preview of spring \u2013 a month or more before it arrives in Britain. The migrant birds are not yet back, but half a dozen different butterflies are on the wing and birdsong fills the air. The scratchy sound of Sardinian warblers, the metallic song of the black redstart, and, from every little bush and tree, the liquid tinkling of serins. A cousin of the canaries trapped in their cages nearby, the serin is Europe\u2019s smallest finch, a plump, yellow ball of feathers fringed with grey and green. Serins are such a common bird here and throughout most of western Europe it\u2019s hard to believe they are so scarce in the UK. Yet from the 1960s onwards they did breed for a while in Devon and Dorset, before deciding that our climate wasn\u2019t quite what they were looking for and retreating back across the channel. Seeing them here, though, gives me hope that one day they might return to Britain, and I\u2019ll hear their delicate song echoing across my own village."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
