The president is now in London for the Nato summit as the House intelligence committee prepares to review its report on the impeachment inquiry. Among today\u2019s many impeachment-adjacent developments: House Republicans released a 123-page report defending Trump against the impeachment inquiry against him. Two Giuliani associates will likely face additional charges, a federal prosecutor said in court in Manhattan. A federal judge denied the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to delay an order requiring former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify before Congress. The Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee \u201cthoroughly investigated\u201d and debunked a key GOP talking point about Ukraine and the 2016 election, Politico reported. Attorney general William Barr is signaling that he may publicly disagree with an inspector general\u2019s conclusion, in an independent report, that the FBI had enough information in the summer of 2016 to justify launching an investigation into members of the Trump campaign, the Washington Post reported. Trump\u2019s reelection campaign announced it would no longer credential Bloomberg News reporters after the outlet said it would not investigate its owner, Michael Bloomberg, a billionaire former Republican who recently announced his candidacy for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, or any of Bloomberg\u2019s Democratic rivals, while still continuing to investigate Trump. Trump tweeted angrily that the news agency\u2019s approach was \u201cnot O.K.\u201d Many media critics actually agree. Trump said in a tweet that his administration would restore steel and aluminum tariffs on Brazil and Argentina, despite the efforts of Brazil\u2019s far-right president to develop an alliance with Trump. Trump\u2019s Attorney General, William Barr, has told associates he disagrees with the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general on a central finding of a forthcoming report \u2014 that the FBI had enough information in the summer of 2016 to justify launching an investigation into members of the Trump campaign, the Washington Post reports. The report from Justice Department\u2019s inspector general Michael Horowitz is expected to be made public in a week. The inspector general operates independently of Justice Department leadership, so Barr cannot order Horowitz to change his findings, the Washington Post notes. Democrats have long argued that Barr, who was confirmed as attorney general in early 2019, acts more like the president\u2019s personal attorney than the attorney general of the entire country, and that his behavior is eroding the independence of the Justice Department. File under Freedom of Information Act victories. Buzzfeed News is suing the Justice Department to publicly release as many documents as possible generated during the Mueller investigation. The Justice Department released a new batch of documents today: hundreds of pages of summaries of FBI interviews. Some highlights from the new documents, according to Buzzfeed News: In February 2017, shortly after his inauguration, Trump wanted former New Jersey governor Chris Christie to tell then-FBI director James Comey that \u201cI really like him.\u201d Christie did not do this, he told FBI investigators, saying it \u201cwould have been uncomfortable.\u201d On Valentine\u2019s Day 2017, Christie was having lunch with Trump when the president told him, \u201cNow that we fired [former Trump national security adviser Michael] Flynn, the Russia thing is over.\u201d Christie told the FBI that he laughed and said \u201cNo way. We\u2019ll be here on Valentine\u2019s Day 2018 talking about this.\u201d Deputy campaign manager Rick Gates told the FBI that \u201cwhile Paul Manafort was running Trump\u2019s campaign, Manafort had pushed the unfounded theory that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that had hacked the Democratic National Committee\u2019s servers.\u201d Trump still cites this debunked theory, as Buzzfeed notes\u2014 and did so during the summer 2019 call with the Ukrainian President that\u2019s at the center of the current impeachment inquiry. Donald Trump\u2019s actions towards Ukraine were \u201centirely prudent\u201d and involved \u201cno quid pro quo, bribery, extortion, or abuse of power\u201d, according to a draft Republican report on last month\u2019s impeachment inquiry hearings. The report provides a blueprint for House Republicans to defend the US president at Wednesday\u2019s judiciary committee hearing and for their Senate counterparts to acquit him in a trial. It also directly contradicts the testimony of career diplomats and makes little attempt to get to grips with the devastating evidence of Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union, who spoke about the existence of a quid pro quo, or Fiona Hill, former top Russia expert at the White House, who warned against falling for Moscow\u2019s propaganda about Ukraine\u2019s role in the 2016 election. Earlier today, Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign announced it will no longer issue press credentials to reporters for Bloomberg News, the agency owned by billionaire Democratic presidential hopeful Michael Bloomberg, after it announced a controversial plan for how it would continue to cover American politics while its owner was running for president. Trump added his own aggrieved tweet on the situation this afternoon, shortly after arriving in the United Kingdom for a NATO meeting. He complained that \u201cMini Mike Bloomberg has instructed his third rate news organization not to investigate him or any Democrat, but to go after President Trump, only\u201d and that this was \u201cnot O.K.!\u201d While generally hostile to the existence of an independent press, Trump is not alone in his opinion that Bloomberg News\u2019 currently approach to managing a massive conflict of interest is \u201cnot O.K.\u201d Bloomberg News\u2019 editor-in-chief announced in late November that the agency\u2019s reporters would still cover polls, policies and how the Bloomberg campaign is faring. But Bloomberg News\u2019 reporters would not do investigative stories on Bloomberg or any other Democratic contender for president, he told the agency\u2019s journalists, while still recapping others\u2019 investigations of Democratic contenders and continuing to investigate the Trump administration. Multiple former Bloomberg editors called the coverage plan unsatisfying and inappropriate. Margaret Sullivan, a prominent Washington Post media columnist and the former public editor of The New York Times, wrote that the initial coverage plans \u201cput Bloomberg\u2019s many talented journalists, especially those in Washington and New York, in a compromised position.\u201d Sullivan and others have argued that a better plan would have been for Bloomberg himself to have \u201centirely recused himself from decision-making or influence at the news organization \u2014 saying, in effect, \u2018cover me like anyone else and do it with journalistic integrity.\u2019\u201d But that\u2019s not what the billionaire former mayor of New York City has decided to do. Sullivan noted that Bloomberg \u201chalf-jokingly\u201d told a radio interviewer last year, \u201cQuite honestly, I don\u2019t want all the reporters I\u2019m paying to write a bad story about me. I don\u2019t want them to be independent.\u201d For Sullivan, Bloomberg\u2019s approach highlighted a similarity between the new 2020 Democratic contender and Trump: \u201cWe already have a rich-guy president who thinks the tried-and-true rules that underpin our democracy aren\u2019t made for him and who doesn\u2019t exhibit a core understanding of the accountability role of an independent press,\u201d she wrote. A month after dropping out of the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, and after pledging he would not run for senate as a challenger to Texas Republican John Cornyn, Beto O\u2019Rourke is focusing on state-level politics in Texas, the Houston Chronicle reports. O\u2019Rourke is trying to use some of his political capital to help flip the Texas House of Representatives from Republican to Democratic control. As House Democrats push forward with their impeachment inquiry, House Republicans have released a 123-page report defending President Donald Trump. Washington journalists called the GOP report a \u201cpre-buttal to the Democrats\u2019 not-yet-drafted articles of impeachment\u201d and a \u201cfull-throated defense\u201d of the president\u2019s dealings with Ukraine. You can read the report here. U.S. District Judge Kentanji Brown Jackson has denied the Trump administration\u2019s request to stay an order requiring former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify before Congress while the administration appeals Jackson\u2019s ruling to a higher court. \u201cFurther delay of the Judiciary Committee\u2019s enforcement of its valid subpoena causes grave harm to both the Committee\u2019s investigation and the interests of the public more broadly,\u201d Jackson wrote, noting also that delaying McGahn\u2019s testimony \u201cwould impede an investigation that a committee of Congress is undertaking as part of an impeachment inquiry.\u201d The judge made clear that McGahn may still invoke executive privilege and refuse to answer Congressional questions during his testimony, but had previously rejected the Trump Justice Department\u2019s argument that the president could give senior aides immunity from having to testify at all. What additional charges might Giuliani allies Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman face from federal prosecutors? A prosector said during a hearing today in Manhattan that additional charges were \u201clikely.\u201d A Florida reporter suggests these charges might involve donations Parnas and Fruman made to Republicans in Florida: Ron DeSantis, now the state\u2019s governor; Rick Scott, the former governor and now one of Florida\u2019s senators, and Brian Mast, one of the state\u2019s members of Congress. As the impeachment inquiry into Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukraine\u2019s president continues, Trump\u2019s Republican allies have repeatedly claimed that the Ukrainian government tried to meddle in the 2016 election to favor Hillary Clinton. That claim was \u201cthoroughly investigated\u201d and debunked by the Republican-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee, Politico reports. The committee \u201cfound no evidence that Ukraine waged a top-down interference campaign akin to the Kremlin\u2019s efforts to help Trump win in 2016.\u201d More from Politico here. More details from federal court in Manhattan: A prosecutor said an upgraded indictment is likely in the criminal case against two Rudy Giuliani associates with ties to Ukraine, the Associated Press reports. Assistant U.S. Attorney Douglas Zolkind made the prediction during a pretrial hearing Monday in the case against Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman. The men are charged with using foreign money to make illegal campaign contributions. Prosecutors say the donations were made while the men were lobbying U.S. politicians to oust the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. The arrest of Parnas and Fruman brought new scrutiny to Giuliani, a former New York City mayor who is President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer. Giuliani has tried to get Ukrainian officials to investigate the son of Trump\u2019s potential Democratic challenger, Joe Biden. Giuliani has said he knew nothing about illegal campaign donations. The Trump administration has quietly released more than $100 million in military assistance to Lebanon after months of unexplained delay, the Associated Press reports. The White House has yet to offer any explanation for the delay, despite repeated queries from Congress. Officials familiar with the matter told the Associated Press that, unlike Ukraine, there has been no suggestion that President Donald Trump is seeking \u201ca favor\u201d from Lebanon in exchange for the aid. Democrats have released a list of witnesses for Wednesday\u2019s hearing to review the evidence for impeaching the president, The Hill\u2019s Olivia Beavers reports: Georgia\u2019s Republican governor is ignoring Donald Trump\u2019s preference and appointing a financial services executive, Kelly Loeffler, to fill the senate seat left vacant when Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson retires for health reasons at the end of the year, according to news reports. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which broke the story, has more background on Loeffler, a multimillionaire with a history of donating to Democratic politicians. Loeffler, the female CEO of a bitcoin business, is not beloved by more conservative Republican politicians in Georgia. But political analysts in the state see her as potentially \u201cable to bring back suburban women who have left the Republican Party during the Trump administration,\u201d the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. Her personal wealth is also seen as a useful asset in funding the special election campaign to fill Isakson\u2019s seat over the longer term. In her application for the open senate job, Loeffler wrote that she would be a staunch ally of Trump, something conservatives have said they doubt. \u201cIf chosen, I will stand with President Trump...to Keep America Great,\u201d Loeffler wrote, according to Politico. \u201cTogether, we will grow jobs, strengthen the border, shutdown drug cartels and human traffickers, lower health care costs, and protect our national interests \u2014 at home and abroad.\u201d Trump wanted Georgia\u2019s Republican governor to appoint Rep. Doug Collins, who is currently the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, who \u201ccould have been a potentially critical juror in any Senate impeachment trial,\u201d Politico reported. Isakson, 74, has been struggling with Parkinson\u2019s disease. At a court hearing in Manhattan, a federal prosecutor said there will \u201clikely\u201d be additional charges in the case against two associates of Rudy Giuliani, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, Bloomberg News reports. The two men pleaded not guilty in October to charges that they used foreign money to make illegal campaign contributions to politicians and committees to advance their business interests. This is Lois Beckett, taking over our live politics coverage from our West Coast bureau. California Gov. Gavin Newsom will travel to Iowa to campaign for Sen. Kamala Harris in mid-December as she tries to rebound amid a critical stretch in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, the Associated Press reports. Harris has staked her campaign on a strong showing in Iowa and recently spent six days over the Thanksgiving holiday campaigning in the state. But she\u2019s still stuck in single digits in most polls, far from the top of the pack that includes former Vice President Joe Biden and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg. More from Free, Melania, of which the Guardian has obtained a copy. CNN reporter Kate Bennett wrote that the first lady suspected Trump ally and adviser, Roger Stone, was responsible for the release of nude photos from her modelling past during the 2016 presidential campaign: Melania has not commented on how she thinks they got into the hands of the tabloid and on to the cover, but friends say she still refuses to believe Trump would do that to her. As for Stone, she\u2019s not so sure. The White House did not respond directly to the allegation, but said the book includes \u201cmany false details and opinions.\u201d Roger Stone\u2019s wife, Nydia, told the Guardian via text that the allegation was \u201ccategorically false and completely illogical.\u201d Roger Stone is awaiting sentencing after being found guilty of obstructing the Mueller investigation. An unauthorized biography of the first lady, Free, Melania, is being released this week, authored by CNN reporter Kate Bennett. Per CNN, takeaways from the book include: Melania Trump has \u201cfrequent, opinionated discussions\u201d with the president, oftentimes more than once a day, via telephone, about policy. The first couple doesn\u2019t share a bedroom. Melania Trump investigated dog breeds and the what types of care a presidential pup would need, but the family ultimately decided not to get a pet \u2013 the first White House family to not have one for the past three decades of first families. California representative Duncan Hunter, a Republican, will plead guilty to campaign finance violations in federal court tomorrow, reversing his previous not guilty position. His wife, Margaret Hunter, has already plead guilty in the case, which included her admission in a plea agreement that the family spent $500 in campaign funds to fly the family\u2019s pet rabbit, Eggburt, across the country. The couple is alleged to hae spent more than $200,000 in campaign donations on family expenses such as vacations and groceries, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune. Ahead of Trump\u2019s visit to the UK, five political party leaders in the country expressed concern about prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s relationship with the US president in a television debate last night. \u201cWe obviously have a hugely important relationship with the US.\u201d said Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader. \u201cBut make no mistake, the current occupant of the White House is not somebody who shares our values.\u201d Nigel Farage, leader of the Brexit party, was the only of seven candidates to defend the president, describing Trump as \u201cour most important friend in the world.\u201d The representative for the Conservative party, Rishi Sunak, tried to stay out of the fray. Meanwhile, 350 leading climate researchers urged Johnson to challenge Trump on his \u201cdangerous\u201d denial of the risks of climate change in a letter tied to the US president\u2019s visit. And the Labour party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, urged the prime minister to break off trade talks with Trump until any reference to pharmaceuticals is struck off the US list of objectives. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Trump\u2019s reelection campaign announced it would no longer credential Bloomberg News reporters after the outlet said it would not investigate its owner, Michael Bloomberg, or any other Democratic presidential candidate. The president is headed to London for the Nato summit as the House intelligence committee prepares to review its report on the impeachment inquiry. Trump said in a tweet that his administration would restore steel and aluminum tariffs on Brazil and Argentina, despite the efforts of Brazil\u2019s far-right president to develop an alliance with Trump. Lisa Page, the former FBI lawyer whose anti-Trump texts with former FBI agent Peter Strzok intensified the president\u2019s accusations of a \u201cdeep state\u201d biased against him, spoke out for the first time in a Daily Beast interview. Page said she decided to do the interview because she wanted to \u201ctake my power back.\u201d My colleague Amanda Holpuch will steer the blog for the next few hours, so stay tuned for more updates from her. Bloomberg News justified its decision to continue investigating Trump, even as it abandoned investigating Democratic presidential candidates, by arguing that the outlet must scrutinize the current government, which the sitting president leads. However, that argument sparked some pushback from media commentators, who warned of a double standard in Bloomberg\u2019s political coverage. Senator Ted Cruz came to Trump\u2019s defense after the president\u2019s reelection campaign announced it would no longer credential Bloomberg News reporters for rallies or other events. The Texas Republican claimed the outlet\u2019s new policy of not investigating Michael Bloomberg or other Democratic presidential candidates as it continues to cover Trump in the same manner equated to conducting opposition research against Republicans. Bloomberg News\u2019 editor-in-chief has pushed back against the Trump campaign\u2019s claim that the outlet\u2019s editors have \u201cdeclared their bias openly\u201d by saying reporters would not investigate Michael Bloomberg or any other Democratic presidential candidate. The Trump campaign\u2019s announcement sparked questions about covering the president\u2019s rallies, given that Bloomberg is one of three outlets that consistently travel to the events. Shortly after Michael Bloomberg announced he would seek the Democratic presidential nomination, the editor-in-chief of Bloomberg News sent a memo to staff outlining how the outlet would cover its owner. \u201cSo Mike is running,\u201d John Micklethwait wrote in the memo. \u201cThere is no point in trying to claim that covering this presidential campaign will be easy for a newsroom that has built up its reputation for independence in part by not writing about ourselves (and very rarely about our direct competitors). No previous presidential candidate has owned a journalistic organization of this size.\u201d Micklethwait said Bloomberg would suspend its editorial board but would strive to report on the billionaire\u2019s campaign as it did everyone else\u2019s. \u201cWe will describe who is winning and who is losing,\u201d Micklethwait said. \u201cWe will look at policies and their consequences. We will carry polls, we will interview candidates and we will track their campaigns, including Mike\u2019s.\u201d But the announcement that Bloomberg News would not investigate its owner or any other Democratic presidential candidate sparked outrage from some media commentators -- and now from Trump\u2019s reelection campaign. Trump\u2019s reelection campaign has just released a statement saying it will no longer issue credentials to Bloomberg News reporters for rallies or other events after the outlet announced it would not investigate Michael Bloomberg or other Democratic presidential candidates in light of the billionaire\u2019s campaign launch. \u201cBloomberg News has declared that they won\u2019t investigate their boss or his Democrat competitors, many of whom are current holders of high office, but will continue critical reporting on President Trump,\u201d campaign manager Brad Parscale said in the statement. \u201cSince they have declared their bias openly, the Trump campaign will no longer credential representatives of Bloomberg News for rallies or other campaign events. We will determine whether to engage with individual reporters or answer inquiries from Bloomberg News on a case-by-case basis. This will remain the policy of the Trump campaign until Bloomberg News publicly rescinds its decision.\u201d Trump, who is en route to London for the Nato summit, is tweeting from Air Force One and applauding senator John Kennedy, who once again peddled a baseless conspiracy theory that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election while appearing on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d yesterday. \u201cThank you to Great Republican @SenJohnKennedy for the job he did in representing both the Republican Party and myself against Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd on Meet the Depressed!\u201d Trump tweeted. Kennedy told host Chuck Todd yesterday, \u201cI think both Russia and Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election.\u201d However, the US intelligence community has only concluded that Russia did so, and intelligence officials have reportedly briefed senators about the Kremlin trying to frame Ukraine for the election meddling. During a public impeachment hearing earlier this month, Fiona Hill, the White House\u2019s former top expert on Russia, said the baseless accusation against Ukraine was \u201ca fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services.\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t briefed,\u201d Kennedy told Todd yesterday. \u201cDr. Hill is entitled to her opinion.\u201d Pete Buttigieg has released his first statewide television ad in South Carolina, which will start to air in the early voting state tomorrow as the Democratic presidential candidate makes his seventh trip there. Buttigieg\u2019s campaign is spending $2 million on the TV ad buy as the Indiana mayor struggles to win over voters in South Carolina. A recent poll showed Buttigieg hitting 6% in the state, but he attracted almost 0% of the support of African Americans, who made up more than half of the state\u2019s 2016 primary electorate. The video itself takes excerpts from Buttigieg\u2019s speech at the Liberty and Justice Dinner in Des Moines last month. \u201cIn our White House, you won\u2019t have to shake your head and ask yourself, \u2018Whatever happened to, \u2018I was hungry and you fed me. I was a stranger and you welcomed me?\u2019\u201d Buttigieg says in the ad. \u201cWhen I say we\u2019ve got to unify the American people it doesn\u2019t mean pretending that we\u2019re all the same. It means unifying around issues from wages and family leave to gun violence and immigration. The hope of an American experience defined not by exclusion but by belonging.\u201d Lisa Page, the former FBI lawyer whose anti-Trump text messages have been used by the president to claim the existence of a \u201cdeep state\u201d within the federal government, has spoken out for the first time in a Daily Beast interview. \u201cI had stayed quiet for years hoping it would fade away, but instead it got worse,\u201d Page said. \u201cIt had been so hard not to defend myself, to let people who hate me control the narrative. I decided to take my power back.\u201d The president has repeatedly mocked Page and Peter Strzok, the former FBI agent who had an extramarital affair with her, and pointed to their critical messages as proof that the bureau was biased against Trump. However, the justice department\u2019s inspector general has reportedly concluded that Page did not conduct herself unprofessionally while working on the bureau\u2019s Russia investigation. \u201cWhile it would be nice to have the IG confirm publicly that my personal opinions had absolutely no bearing on the course of the Russia investigations, I don\u2019t kid myself that the fact will matter very much for a lot of people,\u201d Page said. \u201cThe president has a very loud megaphone.\u201d Speaking to reporters before he left for London, Trump falsely claimed the Ukrainian president had cleared him of wrongdoing in a recent interview with Time magazine. \u201cThe Ukrainian president came out and said very strongly that President Trump did absolutely nothing wrong. That should be case over,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cBut it will never end it because [Democrats] want to do what they want to do.\u201d In reality, Volodymyr Zelenskiy criticized Trump for holding up Ukraine\u2019s military assistance and said that the US president had harmed his country\u2019s economic propsects by calling it corrupt. \u201cLook, I never talked to the President from the position of a quid pro quo. That\u2019s not my thing,\u201d Zelenskiy told Time magazine. \u201cBut you have to understand. We\u2019re at war. If you\u2019re our strategic partner, then you can\u2019t go blocking anything for us. I think that\u2019s just about fairness. It\u2019s not about a quid pro quo. It just goes without saying.\u201d Zelenskiy added that Trump\u2019s claims of corruption in Ukraine could spook companies with capital in the country. \u201cThe United States of America is a signal, for the world, for everyone,\u201d the Ukrainian president said. \u201cWhen America says, for instance, that Ukraine is a corrupt country, that is the hardest of signals.\u201d Trump briefly took questions from reporters before flying to London for the Nato summit, and the president said the Hong Kong bill he just signed could complicate efforts to secure a trade deal with China. Trump signed the bill on Wednesday after much speculation about whether or not he would put his name to it. But the president didn\u2019t have much choice because the legislation, which signaled support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong and authorized sanctions against officials trying to suppress the demonstrations, passed both chambers of Congress with veto-proof majorities. In addition to tweeting complaints about the impeachment inquiry, Trump was also taking care of some trade business this morning -- restoring tariffs on steel and aluminum from Brazil and Argentina. The president blamed the two countries\u2019 depreciating currencies for harming the prospects of US steel and once again urged the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. The announcement marks a defeat for Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil\u2019s right-wing president who appeared to have developed an alliance with Trump. But their shared conservative beliefs were apparently not enough to protect Brazil from these tariffs. The White House announced last night that Trump would not send a lawyer to represent him at the House judiciary committee\u2019s first impeachment hearing, which will take place Wednesday and focus on the constitutional standard for impeaching a president. \u201cWe cannot fairly be expected to participate in a hearing while the witnesses are yet to be named and while it remains unclear whether the Judiciary Committee will afford the President a fair process through additional hearings,\u201d White House counsel Pat Cipollone said in a letter to committee chairman Jerry Nadler. \u201cMore importantly, an invitation to an academic discussion with law professors does not begin to provide the President with an semblance of a fair process. Accordingly, under the current circumstances, we do not intend to participate in your Wednesday hearing.\u201d The House intelligence committee is expected to transmit its report on the impeachment inquiry to the judiciary committee tomorrow, after the panel holds a vote on approving its findings. The timeline keeps the House on track to hold a vote on impeaching Trump by the end of the year, followed by a Senate trial in January. Senate Republicans and the White House have reportedly discussed keeping the trial to two weeks, which means Trump would likely be acquitted before Democrats kick off their presidential primary in February. Nearly everyone in Washington is betting that Trump will be impeached by the Democratic-controlled House before being acquitted by the Republican-controlled Senate. Even if Republicans didn\u2019t control the Senate, it would take a two-thirds majority to remove Trump from office, which seems highly unlikely. Like the president, House speaker Nancy Pelosi is abroad this week, attending the UN climate change conference in Madrid as Trump participates in the Nato summit in London. Pelosi is leading a delegation of 14 other Democrats to the 2019 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. \u201cIt is a privilege to accompany a high-level Congressional delegation to Spain to combat the existential threat of our time: the climate crisis,\u201d Pelosi said in a Saturday statement announcing the trip. During a news conference this morning, the House speaker specified that she would not discuss the impeachment inquiry while she was abroad. The field of candidates chasing the Democratic presidential nomination has (slightly) narrowed with the withdrawals of Montana governor Steve Bullock and former Pennsylvania caongressman Joe Sestak. Neither Bullock nor Sestak were major players in the race, attracting nearly no support in polls and consistently failing to qualify for debates. (Bullock participated in one debate back in July, and Sestak never managed to qualify.) Bullock argued he could capture Democrats\u2019 attention without partcipating in the debates by touting his repeated victories in a state Trump safely carried in 2016, but the Montana governor failed to break through as the presidential field has remained crowded. \u201cWhile there were many obstacles we could not have anticipated when entering this race, it has become clear that in this moment, I won\u2019t be able to break through to the top tier of this still-crowded field of candidates,\u201d Bullock said in a statement announcing his decision. Even with the withdrawals of Bullock and Sestak, 16 candidates remain in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, with just two months left until the Iowa caucuses. Good morning, live blog readers! It will be a busy (and nerve-wracking) week for Donald Trump as the president heads to London for a Nato summit and awaits the release of the House intelligence committee\u2019s report on the impeachment inquiry. Members of the intelligence committee are expected to receive a draft of the report today and will have 24 hours to review it, with a vote on approving the findings likely to take place tomorrow. This will leave enough time for the report to be transmitted to the House judiciary committee before the panel holds its first public impeachment hearing on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Trump will be in London to celebrate the 70th anniversary of Nato, an alliance whose value he has repeatedly questioned. But if history is any indication, the president can be expected to weigh in on the progress of the impeachment inquiry by tweeting from the other side of the pond. Here\u2019s what else the blog is keeping an eye on today: Trump will depart the White House for London at 9:45 a.m. ET.
