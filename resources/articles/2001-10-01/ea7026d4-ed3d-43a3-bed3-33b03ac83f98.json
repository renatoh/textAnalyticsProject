Planning is rarely simple. Once you solve one problem, two more tend to appear. Most people find it easier to put it off - often delaying until retirement looms large. But now there's a new Guardian Guide to Planning for Retirement. The guide looks at pensions and other ways of saving for your retirement, based on how your needs change with age. It has unique sections designed to help you catch up, whatever life stage you've reached. The emphasis is on positive planning - how to find suitable schemes whether you go to an adviser or adopt a DIY approach to pensions. It warns of potential pitfalls ahead and tells how to keep options open - someone retiring in five years' time after 40 years of work will have lived through five state schemes alone - plus any number of occupational or private plans. So flexibility is crucial. The Guardian Guide to Planning for Retirement, sponsored by independent financial advisers Millfield Partnership, is free. For your copy, phone 0800-694-7007. But what happens when you reach your 50s, 60s, 70s or beyond? There are lifestyle choices as well as financial options. Today Jobs &amp; Money launches Maturing Interest, a new, regular column by Margaret Hughes, who has a lifetime of financial experience to share with readers. Maturing Interest will deal with both the comfortable and uncomfortable aspects of being older. These must-read pages are your pages. So let Margaret Hughes know what you want her to write about. \u0095 You can get in touch by writing to me at the Guardian, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER or by emailing me at margaret.hughes@theguardian.com, Please send copies of any relevant documents and include a daytime phone number."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
