It happened after a mental breakdown and it was the first time I\u2019d ever been in trouble with the police. In total, I spent 18 months in custody. Before that, I had been studying for A-levels in chemistry, history and philosophy. I\u2019d always been academic and loved history, and I suppose I thought I\u2019d end up studying a humanities subject. Instead I felt like I was never going to have a normal life anymore, because I\u2019d blown my chance. There are people in and out of prison all the time. It\u2019s an unhappy place \u2013 not somewhere everyone sits around watching telly. I had a job in the gym at first and later worked in the gardens. There were no options to get any qualifications as classes only went up to level three English and maths, and I already had my GCSEs. The focus was on the people who didn\u2019t have any education, which I understood. When I came out, I was at a loss about what to do. I was rejected for all the jobs I applied for, so I thought further study would make me more employable. I ended up applying to uni on the off-chance after seeing an advert on the back of a bus. I had to do a diploma first, as I\u2019d not finished my A-levels, and I also had to disclose my history in meetings with a tutor. Fortunately, they were understanding and allowed me to go ahead. Last year, I graduated with a degree in animal management. Being at uni made me feel like a normal person again: I was surrounded by people my own age, I was going out and getting out of the house, and it was refreshing. My family were very supportive but for a long time I didn\u2019t tell any of my new friends about my past. When people talked about their background, I had to make things up. If anybody suspected it, they never said anything. In the end there were one or two close friends that I did tell: I felt like I could trust them and I didn\u2019t have to lie. They had gotten to know me as a person and were supportive. It felt good knowing people wouldn\u2019t just dismiss me if I told them. My conviction made it hard for me to live a normal student life. Although the uni allowed me to do the degree, I wasn\u2019t allowed to stay on campus as it was considered a risk for other students. I think living in halls would have been beneficial, as I had moved to a city I didn\u2019t know and had to live on my own. There were also opportunities for part-time jobs as stewards or mentors which I couldn\u2019t do: I\u2019m automatically excluded for any job that involves working with older people, young people or vulnerable adults. I understand my actions impacted on someone\u2019s life in a negative way. I didn\u2019t get away with it \u2013 I served my time. If someone does a DBS check it is always going to be there, and I have to declare it whenever I go for jobs. You\u2019re never really free. But now I feel like I\u2019ve been given a second chance in life. I\u2019ve just accepted a job working for a government agency, which I start next week. Getting this job feels like they have decided it\u2019s time I can move on. Things can grind you down but that\u2019s the same with anything in life. There are so many opportunities out there. It\u2019s such a waste to live a life in prison. Anna Ross is a pseudonym."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
