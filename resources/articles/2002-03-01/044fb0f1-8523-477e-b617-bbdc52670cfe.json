While Keane misses tonight's tie with Boavista because of a hip injury and Van Nistelrooy is in Holland for treatment on a groin problem, Veron is causing most concern. The Argentinian is to see a specialist about a foot injury that could rule him out of much of the season's run-in. \"Seba went for a shot in the second half against Bayern Munich [six days ago] and the defender block-tackled it,\" said the manager Sir Alex Ferguson. \"There may be a wee broken bone in there.\" If the worst is confirmed, Veron's absence would be a major setback at a critical time. Yet Saturday's 5-3 win at West Ham reinforced the feeling that United pose a more formidable threat with Paul Scholes in midfield rather than their \u00a328.1m record signing. Scholes will play tonight in a tie United must win to top the group above Bayern Munich. Group winners cannot be pitted together in Friday's draw for the quarter-finals, meaning United would avoid Real Madrid. \"It's not cast in stone that it would benefit us, because Roma or Barcelona will be waiting for one of the group winners, as might Arsenal,\" said Ferguson. \"But the important thing is that it would guarantee missing Real.\" Unusually Ferguson named his team yesterday with Diego Forlan profiting from Van Nistelrooy's absence and Nicky Butt coming in for Keane. Ferguson was yesterday awarded \u00a37,500 libel damages in the high court over an allegation in David Mellor's column in the Evening Standard. Mellor had claimed Ferguson was paid \u00a310,000 per match to give interviews to ITV during their coverage. Boavista (probable, 4-1-3-2): Pereira; Frechaut, Turra, Pedro Emanuel, Jorge Silva; Petit; Sanchez, Martelinho, Lima; Ventura, Silva. Manchester United (4-4-2): Barthez; G Neville, Johnsen, Blanc, Silvestre; Beckham, Butt, Scholes, Giggs; Forlan, Solskjaer. Referee: K Plautz (Austria). \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
