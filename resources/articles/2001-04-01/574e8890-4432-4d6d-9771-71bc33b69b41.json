Better known in Manchester circles as a close friend of the group Black Grape, who wrote the song Fat Neck in his honour, Mr Power emerged yesterday as the mystery 12th man who sneaked on to the pitch at Bayern Munich on Wednesday night and into the offical team photo. To the obvious astonishment of the team, whose nerves were stretched before the European Champions' League game quarter-final match, the burly fan peeled off a tracksuit to reveal an almost perfect white strip, bearing the name Cantona on the back before joining in the team picture. \"The shorts weren't quite right,\" admitted a spokesman for the London-based lads' magazine Front, which organised what it called \"the ultimate blag\". \"But we were just amazed to have got him in there - not to mention into the players' hotel and Alex Ferguson's car.\" The magazine has pulled off a number of other scams, including a successful Front trip-up of Noel Edmonds and the smuggling of a stripper on to TV's Vanessa show. Piers Hernu, editor of Front magazine, said he had thought up the scam with a man called the Imposter who has conned his way into every big Manchester United game over the past 10 years . Four men were involved in Wednesday's stunt: Mr Power, Front writer Eddie Hardin, photographer James Stemson and the Imposter, who Mr Hernu refused to name. All four had managed to acquire Uefa bibs outside the Munich ground, the type usually worn by press photographers or television cameramen. They waited at the side of the pitch and as the teams emerged, Power unzipped his track suit and joined the United team. He then returned to his friends and watched the match. Manchester United defender Jaap Stam said last night: \"All I can say is that we walked out of the tunnel and then this guy suddenly appeared when we posed for photographers. A few of us were looking around thinking: Who the hell is this guy?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
