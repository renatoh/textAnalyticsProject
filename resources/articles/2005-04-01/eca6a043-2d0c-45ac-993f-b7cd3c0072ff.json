The council said 11,499 overseas-trained nurses from outside the EU applied to join the UK register in the 12 months to the end of March, compared with 14,122 the previous year. The 19% reduction followed a period of heavy recruitment from countries including the Philippines, India and South Africa, which allowed the NHS to achieve its growth targets. The Royal College of Nursing warned last November that the expansion of the NHS was \"built on sand\". The inflow from abroad might turn into an exodus of British and overseas staff, as the US steps up a drive to recruit more than a million nurses by 2012. The profession was also ageing, with more than a quarter of nurses over 50 and starting to think about retirement. Lower recruitment from abroad was partly offset by a 6% increase in the number of UK-trained nurses coming on to the register. The council said 20,588 British nurses qualified in the year to March - the highest figure since the early 1990s."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
