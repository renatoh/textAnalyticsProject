That\u2019s only fair given the other two women\u2019s quarter-finals have to be sorted out tomorrow, along with the remaining men\u2019s quarter-finals. Katy Murrells will be in the hotseat tomorrow. Hopefully she\u2019ll have more luck with the weather. Bye! There\u2019s no sign of the rain stopping, so all four of these quarter-finals will have to be completed tomorrow. That\u2019s excellent news for the players on the other half of the draw. It\u2019s still raining. \u201cI honestly think that hotdog was the worst thing Fed could have done to Djoko,\u201d James Hutchison says. \u201cIt gave him the motivation never to be humiliated like that again. Would have been better to lose the point and still win the match (which he was winning by a large margin).\u201d Well, Djokovic did do this to Federer two years later. I bring bad news: it sounds like there might be no play today. That would create quite a packed schedule tomorrow. There will be no play before 3pm. It\u2019s still raining. It\u2019s still raining. Might as well find a way to fill the time. Oh dear. The covers are on at Roland Garros, where it\u2019s very wet. Preparatory reading Hello and welcome to live coverage of the remaining French Open quarter-finals. The men take to the court later, with Novak Djokovic facing Alexander Zverev and Dominic Thiem facing Whoopi Goldberg Karen Khachanov, but the women are up first. Defending champion Simona Halep is faces the rising American teenager Amanda Anisimova on Philippe-Chatrier, while you wouldn\u2019t want to be a tennis ball when Australia\u2019s Ashleigh Barty takes on the USA\u2019s Madison Keys. Play begins at: 1pm BST and 2pm in Paris."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
