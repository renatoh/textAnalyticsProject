Like Mr Howard, I must thank the mechanics of immigration for making my presence here today possible. He has a Labour MP as benefactor for his father's entry from Romania while my history rests on a much more bog-standard immigration department decision made in favour of my non-English-speaking grandparents from Lithuania in the early 1900s. I presume that a large number of voters in the upcoming election need only go back a generation or two to find a real life connection with the immigration issue. I'm all for a richly varied influx of immigrants and I would love to see the government get it right. Granted, we are a fairly small island and there is far too much animosity about asylum seekers, so here is another campaign issue that is bound to be complicated and carry contentious proposals. Labour's five-year plan makes practical sense to me: a skills test and Australian-style points system for those wanting to work here, electronic borders and identity cards and a general clampdown on dependants, people-traffickers and false asylum claims. But it would certainly put a tremendous strain on government finances. If only we could pull out of this wretched quagmire in Iraq and stop haemorrhaging money we could approach this major initiative with more of a real budget to spend on it. There are other hurdles: immigrants allowed to work here in the NHS, for example, need protection. There was a recent damning report of migrants being exploited by state bodies such as the NHS. It cited a qualified nurse from Asia brought to Britain by an agency. He and others had to pay \u00a3700 to agencies plus a month's deposit and rent on a squalid flat. When they started at the NHS their monthly pay was \u00a3805 but it was cut to \u00a3198 after initial unfair deductions. I don't think this kind of thing is widespread, but just the fact that it happens is worrying. There is also the shocking inability of many Britons to live in harmony with asylum seekers, legal and illegal. Our race riots date all the way back to 1958 and are escalating. This needs more than a simple sticky plaster administered by the police. The Tories can promote HIV tests for migrants, I don't mind that. But their set quota on the number of refugees is not carefully designed. As usual, their ideas have little conviction or common-sense logic behind them. The Liberal Democrats have been right to discount these Tory proposals. They seem to be generally aligned with Labour on many points. I'm impressed with Lib Dems' proposal that an independent agency to assess immigration applications would be preferable to Home Office control."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
