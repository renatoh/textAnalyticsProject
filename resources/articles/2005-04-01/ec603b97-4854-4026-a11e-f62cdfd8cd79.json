The Special Reconnaissance Regiment, the SRR, is the first special forces unit to be created since the end of the second world war and will be based in Hereford, home of the SAS. The regiment, consisting of women as well as men, will be fully operational from today. The Ministry of Defence refused to disclose its size of but it is likely to be less than half the size of the SAS, which consists of some 450 elite troopers. In a separate development yesterday, it emerged that murder charges against a British soldier are to be dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service on Thursday. Trooper Kevin Williams, of the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment, was the first member of the British Armed Forces charged with murder over postwar operations in Iraq. The 22-year-old from Burnley, Lancashire, was accused of killing an Iraqi civilian, Hassan Abbad Said, a lawyer and father of nine, near Basra on August 3 2003. His mother, Julie Williams, said: \"I found out yesterday when I had a phone call from his guardians. I'm pleased about it - that's an understatement. It is a big relief and I haven't slept all night.\" Meanwhile, a court martial in Colchester heard yesterday how a British military Land Rover had been \"stationary\" when it was in a crash with a taxi carrying 14 people on a motorway in Iraq. Five Iraqi women died as a result of the crash near Basra in February 2004. Senior Aircraftman James Bowskill, 25, denies causing death by dangerous driving. The taxi driver, Muhammad Hussain, said: \"There was no fault on me or my car. It was deliberate misconduct on the part of the soldier who was driving the [Land Rover].\" Lawyers for Mr Bowskill said Mr Hussain's version of events differed from the version he had given to police last year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
