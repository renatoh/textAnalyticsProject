The sell-off started even before the US markets opened as yields on Italian bonds were driven over 7% by investors who fear the country may be unable to repay its debts. The yield on Italian debt is now at levels experienced in Ireland, Greece and Portugal before their bailouts. The losses followed two days of gains on US markets after investors reacted positively to news from Greece that it was pushing ahead with Europe's bailout plans. Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of Harris Private Bank, said: \"The markets are being totally driven by news about Europe. There are ominous implications when an economy the size of Italy can't manage its debts. The interest rate on its debt is now higher than its growth. Things can't continue like that.\" After all the major European stock markets had closed down, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 11780.94, 389.24 points lower, or 3.2%, its biggest one-day slide since September 22. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 46.82 points, or 3.7%, to 1229.10, while the Nasdaq Composite declined 105.84 points, or 3.9%, to 2621.65. Ablin said the sell-off continued after the European markets had closed and that he would expect Asian and European markets to open down on Thursday as investors absorb the news from Italy. Financial firms were particularly hard hit by the sell-off. Morgan Stanley's shares fell 9% while JP Morgan fell 7.1%. The US government and the banks have dismissed concerns that US banks have large direct exposures to Europe's debt woes. But investors seem spooked, especially after the collapse of MF Global, a broker run by former Goldman Sachs boss and New Jersey governor Jon Corzine. MF Global declared bankruptcy after making a series of bad bets on European debts. Lance Roberts of broker Street Talk Advisers said there could be worse to come. US stock markets rallied through October but he believes that was due in large part to technical reasons. Pension funds and other large investment vehicles had sold too much stock and in order to balance their portfolios had to buy more shares, he said. \"Well we've run through that course,\" Roberts said. \"If you strip out the crisis news, the world economic view is not good. Europe is in a recession, China is going too slow, and the US will follow,\" he said. \"I don't see a positive way out of this: we have no leadership in Washington or Europe. The only solution they come up with is creating more debt to deal with a problem that was created by more debt.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
