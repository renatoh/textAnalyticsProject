Ohuruogu completed a 12-month ban imposed by UK Athletics for missing three out-of-competition drug tests, an offence that saw her withdrawn from the Great Britain team on the eve of last year's European championships, five months after the 23-year-old from east London had beaten the Olympic champion Tonique Williams-Darling in Melbourne. The ban has cost Ohuruogu dearly. Cowan revealed last week that, mainly because of legal fees, she was around \u00a320,000 in debt and only the support of her family and friends had enabled her to prepare for a comeback. A lack of funds also means she has not yet challenged her lifetime ban from the Olympic Games, imposed by the British Olympic Association (BOA) on drug offenders. But Cowan hopes she will be in the British team for the world championships in Osaka, starting on August 25, when the final names are announced tomorrow, despite not racing since last summer's Norwich Union London grand prix. \"She trained last Thursday and then did a time-trial which we had planned and she ran what we expected,\" said Cowan. \"Of course what she's been doing in training cannot be compared to the atmosphere of racing. But looking to the future, it will be of massive benefit for Christine if she can go to Osaka and uses the championships to getting used to preparing and running in preliminary rounds.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
