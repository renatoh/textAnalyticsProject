The speeches by present and former leaders were cheered on by some of the tribe's most loyal servants. The evening, which raised a six-figure sum, was convened by Alastair Campbell, who always served Blair as leader of his tribe and never as a courtier motivated by personal ambition. The evening was designed to celebrate British sport, weeks before the opening of the Olympics, which London won after an intense lobbying campaign by Blair in 2005. The theme of the evening \u2013 that the Olympics were only secured for London after an active role played by the government \u2013 provided the perfect opportunity for Blair's return to frontline British politics. The former prime minister will advise Ed Miliband on what Labour can do to help ensure that the current government lives up to the undertakings given by Blair in 2005. These were to ensure that the Games create a legacy that will help promote social mobility in sport. Blair, who made a point of portraying himself in Downing Street as a One Nation political figure almost above the fray, was said to be happy to attend such a tribal event. He appears to have moved on from his memoirs, in which he came close to endorsing the coalition's deficit reduction plans. The former prime minister believes that the coalition is cutting too far and too fast, though he feels Labour should be more open about its failure to rein in spending from 2005. Blair is withering about the Liberal Democrats who are, he believes, simply enabling a Tory government to do Tory things. If the evening represented a coming together of the Labour tribe, it also highlighted a growing personal warmth between Miliband and Blair, who are both mellowing. Miliband is cooling his rhetoric about the death of New Labour, just as Blair is making clear in private that he accepts that the world has moved on. The former prime minister was therefore able to applaud Miliband as he paid homage to the past while looking firmly to the future, as he highlighted three lessons provided by Blair. These were, he said, the importance of unity, the importance of adopting new approaches for new times, as Blair did in 1994 and Miliband is now, and the importance of winning to ensure that Labour can help vulnerable people abandoned by the Tories. As some in the Labour party find difficult to acknowledge, Blair knows a thing or two about winning. He did, after all, do it three times in a row."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
