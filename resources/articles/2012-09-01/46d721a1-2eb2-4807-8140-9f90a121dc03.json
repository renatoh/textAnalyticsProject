Three weeks ago, Yaqoob, a former Birmingham city councillor, criticised Respect's sole MP, George Galloway, for his suggestion that the rape allegations against the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange amounted to little more than \"really bad manners\" and \"bad sexual etiquette\". In a statement posted on Respect's website on Tuesday, Yaqoob said: \"It is with deep regret that I have decided to resign from Respect. The last few weeks have been extremely difficult for everyone in the party. I feel necessary relations of trust and collaborative working have unfortunately broken down. I have no wish to prolong those difficulties, and indeed hope that they may now be drawn to a close.\" The loss of Yaqoob, a passionate advocate for the leftwing anti-war party, will be regarded as a major blow to Respect, but it does not come as a surprise. In a posting on her own website last month, Yaqoob emphatically distanced herself from Galloway, the MP for Bradford West, who had claimed that even if the complaints against Assange by two women in Sweden were \"100% true\", they still could not be considered rape. Assange denies the allegations. At the time, Yaqoob described Galloway's comments as \"deeply disappointing and wrong\" and said the \"political issues\" surrounding Assange's case should not be used to lessen the gravity of the accusations against him. In her statement on Tuesday night, she added: \"I remain committed to the principles and values that led me to help found Respect. The policies we have fought for need to be voiced as loud as ever in opposition to a political establishment that remains out of touch with working people.\" \"I would like to thank everyone in the party for their support over the years; I wish everyone the very best for the future and in those common struggles for peace, justice and equality that I am sure we will all continue to be involved in.\" Chris Chilvers, the party's national secretary, said: \"While we are obviously very sorry that Salma has decided to leave Respect, we would like to thank her for the great contribution she has made to Respect over the last decade. We look forward to working with Salma in the future in pursuit of our shared values and objectives.\" Yaqoob was elected as a Birmingham city councillor in 2006, having won 49% of the vote in an inner-city council ward, and has remained as Respect's best known figure after Galloway. A qualified psychotherapist, she took her first steps into politics in the aftermath of 9/11 and and has described herself as being part of the labour movement, with political values based on social justice and opposition to war."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
