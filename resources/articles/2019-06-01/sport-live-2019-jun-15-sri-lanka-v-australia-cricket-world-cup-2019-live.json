Barney Ronay\u2019s match report. That\u2019s all from from me at The Oval. Thanks for your company throughout the afternoon. I\u2019ll be with you again from Old Trafford tomorrow for the biggest game in the group stage: India vs Pakistan. Until then, have a lovely Saturday night. Bye! Aaron Finch speaks. \u201cI thought we were a touch short with the new ball. They have great players who can take the game away so quickly. It\u2019s tough, you want to hit the top of the off-stump but when they are hitting balls off there you have to change up and we didn\u2019t quickly enough early. It was nice for Maxwell to have that long boundary. It was tough with the short boundary at Taunton; players back themselves to take him on. So it was nice here being able to bowl properly, having that real estate. In each game we have improved in the middle overs. The way we dragged it back was really impressive. Then Starcy, as soon as he gets a sniff of a new batsman he is all over them. The next game we have is a Trent Bridge so we have to assess if we can get ten overs out of a part-time option otherwise you have to go with an all-round option to bowl with Maxwell. We have played some really good cricket in patches but with plenty of room to improve, which is a positive.\u201d Dimuth Karunaratne speaks. \u201cIt is a pretty good wicket. We thought there would be some seam movement but it was a good batting track. We bowled well in the first 25 overs but then Finch and Smith batted really well. We fought back strongly but it wasn\u2019t enough. We got a good start with myself and Kusal but we couldn\u2019t capitalise and keep the momentum on. They are class bowlers but we\u2019ve played against them for a long time and know what they\u2019re going to do. We need to keep a plan with what to do in those periods. That\u2019s what is missing. We\u2019ve lost a couple of matches due to the rain but we need to win a couple of matches against the big sides and if we can do that we can make the top four. We want to get into the semi-finals.\u201d Aaron Finch is player of the match. Talking about his 153, he paid a lot of credit to Steve Smith for helping him get through the gears in their big stand and Glenn Maxwell for his hitting leading into the death. We\u2019ll hear from him again in a moment when his captains\u2019 hat is on. It was a fantastic knock from the skipper. Australia did that well. From 115/0, Sri Lanka lost 10/132. How? The usual way in a World Cup fixture: Mitch Starc. After knocking over Kusal Perera (52), the run rate slumped for Sri Lanka after their rapid 87-0 start in the first ten overs. All four of Australia\u2019s quicks battled to begin but fought back well to share the ten wickets between them. Maxwell, the fifth bowler, was excellent as well getting through his ten overs giving up just 46 runs. Aaron Finch will be very happy with that, especially given they don\u2019t have access to Marcus Stoinis at the moment. Down to the post-game presentations. Back in a tick with Aaron Finch and co. Cummins (2/38) gets the tenth and that\u2019s the game! Pradeep backs away and gets an edge at last. Australia win, the two points taking them to the top of the ladder. 45th over: Sri Lanka 246-9 (Dhananjaya 15, Pradeep 0) Target 335 Thinking on my feet, this is the problem with using Net Run Rate as a tiebreak decider. You don\u2019t see this kind of trash cricket if, say, sixes struck (or something like that) split the teams. Anyway. Richardson bowls a wide then finds his line, Dhananjaya\u2019s scoop falling an inch short of Behrendorff. But they go upstairs to check it anyway, the TV umpire taking waaay too long to confirm what everyone knew after one replay: it\u2019s NOT OUT. He plays the very same trick shot from the next ball but clears Benrendorff\u2019s right hand on the edge of the circle for four. He gives Pradeep the strike for one ball after hacking into midwicket. Gross. Pradeep backs away again, swinging and missing. These are minutes of our lives we are never getting back. I know Matthew Engel hates NRR. Why would I disagree with him? 44th over: Sri Lanka 240-9 (Dhananjaya 10, Pradeep 0) Target 335 Gosh, make it stop. Dhananjaya repeats the pattern of the previous over, denying Cummins a crack at Pradeep until the penultimate ball of the over. The No11 backs away so far that he can\u2019t reach a ball that misses off stump by a coat of varnish, repeating that in response to the final ball, sailing over middle stump by about six inches. Yuk. 43rd over: Sri Lanka 238-9 (Dhananjaya 9, Pradeep 0) Target 335 For what little it matters to Net Run Rate in the unlikely event that they can bat out the overs, Dhananjaya is protecting Pradeep from the strike when picking out sweepers. He gets one chance at the No11 to finish the game (and his spell with a fifth wicket but it isn\u2019t to be), but the delivery is steered to third man. They elect not to take the single so that Dhananjaya keeps the strike. Grim cricket. He finishes with 4/55. 42nd over: Sri Lanka 237-9 (Dhananjaya 8, Pradeep 0) Target 335 Pradeep keeps out two Richardson yorkers, extending the game by an over. They have lost 6/32. Richardson gets himself a third. Malinga, wanting nothing to do with the pace, spoons the easiest of chances to Khawaja at cover. Start the car. 41st over: Sri Lanka 237-8 (Dhananjaya 8, Malinga 1) Target 335 I neglected to mention in the previous Starc over that he was actually on a hat-trick. He\u2019s in here now looking for a fifth, attacking the stumps of Dhananjaya who is just able to keep out the yorkers and low full tosses. Not to be, but he has one to come. Brendon McCullum makes a very good point on the TV commentary: why didn\u2019t they go after Glenn Maxwell, Australia\u2019s fifth bowler, when they were going so nicely earlier in the innings? It\u2019s as though they got to ten overs and put the anchor down. It made no sense at the time and even less now that the chase is in ruins. \u201cTypically shabby Australian spoil-sportery denying a much-needed underdog victory,\u201d says a frustrated Brian Withington. \u201cFor a team supposedly not exactly firing on full cylinders, it\u2019s looking rather ominous for the opposition if they ever get their act together.\u201d Something like that. I didn\u2019t agree with this view until today but I nearly do now. Richardson ends his over with a short ball that Udana tries to smack back over his head with the horizontal bat, but he isn\u2019t getting it over Aaron Finch running backwards with the flight from mid-off to take the straightforward chance over his head. The Australian captain throws a smiling thumbs up to his fans in the OSC Stand after taking the chance. Sri Lanka are floudering and Australia know it. 40th over: Sri Lanka 236-8 (Dhananjaya 8) Target 335 39th over: Sri Lanka 229-7 (Dhananjaya 8, Udana 2) Target 335 Dhananjaya ends the successful Starc over with a delightful drive down the ground for four. With Mendis\u2019 wicket goes any realistic hope for Sri Lanka, edging a ball angled across him that he was trying to whack into the legside. Starc has four, making 13 for the World Cup. What an amazing record he has in these tournaments. 38th over: Sri Lanka 222-6 (Mendis 30, Dhananjaya 3) Target 335 Dhanahjaya de Silva is the new man, who can do plenty of damage with the blade, as Australia well know. Behrendorff is turned to by Finch, once again using the fall of A wickets to swing a change and squeeze out a frugal over. It works: five from it. Huge, huge, huge game tomorrow. I\u2019m off to Manchester tonight. Can\u2019t wait. Six and out! First ball at the crease, Perera makes good enough contact to clear the rope at fine leg. But two balls later, trying to smash him over mid-on, he fails to clear Warner on the 30m circle, who takes a good catch moving to his right. That makes two in the over for Starc, leaving Sri Lanka in serious trouble. 37th over: Sri Lanka 217-6 (Mendis 28) Target 335 Starc hits the stumps once again! How often do we see it? To the new man, the left-handed Siriwardana, Starc angles in at pace and hits leg stump, the ball finding the woodward via his back pad. They\u2019re in for the kill now. 36th over: Sri Lanka 208-4 (Mendis 27, Siriwardana 3) Target 335 Siriwardana is off the mark with a couple to midwicket to get off the mark, ending Cummins\u2019 first over back. An important one that saw the end of Angelo Mathews. Once again a Finch bowling change brings a big reward. Mathews out hooking! Back into the attack, Cummins\u2019 bumper isn\u2019t online but the shot is no good, helped into the waiting hands of Carey. Just as it was the last time Mendis hit a straight six, it has been followed the next over by his partner getting out caught behind. Sri Lanka are wobbling. They need a hero. 35th over: Sri Lanka 204-3 (Mendis 26, Mathews 9) Target 335 Starc is back and MENDIS LOVES IT! What a shot to begin, stepping into a full ball and smashing him back over his head for SIX! After taking ownership early in the over, Mathews does the same to finish with a powerful pull into the gap behind squre for four. 11 off it all up. Could this be the start of something? Sri Lanka still need 8.8 an over. 34th over: Sri Lanka 193-3 (Mendis 19, Mathews 5) Target 335 Glenn Maxwell: 10-0-46-0. Can\u2019t ask for much more than that our of your fifth bowler; just the three singles from this final over. Clarke is discussing his progress in the national sides. \u201cI don\u2019t think he and Steve Smith saw eye to eye when he was captain.\u201d Meanwhile at the other game, Afghanistan are continuing to collapse. 33rd over: Sri Lanka 190-3 (Mendis 17, Mathews 4) Target 335 Karunaratne departs with Sri Lanka now needing 8.35 an over to win. After such a brisk start, he fell on 97 from 108 balls, sorted out after a period where Australia slowed the game down nicely. He will have to wait for his maiden ODI ton. Angelo Mathews is the new man to the middle and is away first ball with a lovely on-driven four! As you do. But Richardson uses the short ball well, twice bumping the new man with accurate bouncers and squeezing out four dots to end his successful over. I Am Australian is playing over here between overs. Such a powerful and inclusive song during in the 1990s, it would be written off as virtue signalling nowadays. Karunaratne has gifted Maxwell the easiest of chances in the gully! The cut was probably on but he got too cute, paying the price just three runs short of what would have been a wonderful World Cup ton. 32nd over: Sri Lanka 186-2 (Karunaratne 97, Mendis 17) Target 335 That\u2019s one way! What is looking like another limp over for the chasing side - 17 runs from the previous 4.5 overs - ends with a BIG SIX over Maxwell\u2019s head! The Sri Lankan gun was down the track waiting for the off-break, getting to the pitch and nailing it. 31st over: Sri Lanka 178-2 (Karunaratne 96, Mendis 10) Target 335 There is a lot to like about Richardson, such a resilient cricketer. Justin Langer said that a year ago he didn\u2019t think the South Australian had the \u201cbottle\u201d for international cricket. Now, he\u2019s being turned to at a clutch time. Four dots and two singles make it a very good over, Mendis not far away from gifting his wicket with a miscued hook. The squeeze is on and Sri Lanka need to find a way out of it. 30th over: Sri Lanka 176-2 (Karunaratne 95, Mendis 9) Target 335 Clever bowling from Maxwell, cramping up both batsmen by attacking the stumps. Finch is throwing it around, milking overs out in spells of two or three overs. 20 overs remain and Sri Lanka need just on eight an over to pull off a massive win. 29th over: Sri Lanka 173-2 (Karunaratne 93, Mendis 8) Target 335 Richardson has to follow the example of Behrendorff, the other seamer who took some tap from the opening pair during the opening power play. He\u2019ll be happy with this re-start, five runs taken but no boundary balls. Karunaratne is into the 90s. Mark Nicholas and Michael Clarke note that Australia also went through a quiet period in their innings and that\u2019s true. They were 110 at the halfway mark, for what it\u2019s worth. 28th over: Sri Lanka 168-2 (Karunaratne 89, Mendis 7) Target 335 Behrendorff has done his job in this his second spell, yet to give up a boundary and collecting the wicket of Thirimanne. Karunaratne is trying to lift the tempo against him but there is nothing there for it, missing a pre-meditated hoick to the legside. The rate required is most of of the way to eight an over now. Meanwhile, Afghanistan are in strife at Cardiff, South Africa taking a fifth wicket. 27th over: Sri Lanka 159-2 (Karunaratne 83, Mendis 4) Target 335 Just 24 from the last five overs as these two work their way into it, Cummins through his fifth with four singles taken to the fielders at fine leg and third man. He won\u2019t mind that. Kumar Sangakkara notes that Sri Lanka are 40 runs ahead of where Australia were at the same stage of the innings but it doesn\u2019t quite feel like that right now. \u201cSpeaking as a disinterested England supporter,\u201d emails Brian Withington, \u201can improbable Sri Lanka win today and Pakistan squeaking a thriller tomorrow would be simply marvellous for the dynamic of the tournament. Just saying.\u201d Agreed. A couple of underdog wins would do a lot of good in terms of setting up a scrap in the final week of round-robin games. This a potential downside of a long group stage, of course - dead rubbers (see 1996). But we\u2019re not there yet. 26th over: Sri Lanka 159-2 (Karunaratne 83, Mendis 4) Target 335 Karunaratne is playing like a man who knows he needs to make this a very big ton, happy to defend with patience after a few singles are taken from Behrendorff. If he throws it away this game will change in an instant. A tough balance to strike in a big chase. 25th over: Sri Lanka 156-2 (Karunaratne 82, Mendis 2) Target 335 Fairly handy time for Finch to bring Cummins back, who only bowled three overs earlier today. He sends one down the legside to Mendis but other than that, keeps him honest with an set full of dots banged in short of a length at genuine pace. \u201cYou can\u2019t be a cricket fan and not like statistics,\u201d writes Simon McMahon in reference to Kusal Perera\u2019s 153 and calculations that had it dubbed the best ever. \u201cMy favourite definition of the appeal of the cricket actually came from a previous OBO and is along the lines of \u2018basically all day drinking, with statistics\u2019, which is right up there alongside \u2018organised loafing\u2019. The fact that half of all statistics are made up, and the other 60% just inaccurate, is neither here nor there.\u201d 24th over: Sri Lanka 154-2 (Karunaratne 82, Mendis 1) Target 335 Kusal Mendis is a name that prompts respect (and probably fear) in the Australian camp after his heroics three years ago. He\u2019s off the mark with one to backward square first ball, completing Behrendorff\u2019s successful over; Thirimanne his first World Cup scalp. How disappointing for Sri Lanka. After copping a whack to the arm then responding with a lavish boundary through point, Thirimanne tries to play a glide from way too close to his body, edging to Carey who pouches an easy chance. 23rd over: Sri Lanka 145-1 (Karunaratne 81, Thirimanne 10) Target 335 Maxwell finds the inside edge of Karunaratne to begin, which could easily have been the end of his day. Not to be. But again, with only four runs taken, the degree of difficulty is slowly rising up for Sri Lanka. Maxwell only has three more to bowl. \u201cI wonder if there is a sport anywhere where the standards have improved so dramatically over the past decade?\u201d asks Gideon Cleary. \u201cI\u2019m talking about the fielding, across every team, the catching them tossing up because you were crossing over the rope was a once a season happening, now it\u2019s every power-play. I watch cricket in London Fields and the only thing that stops a cover drive is either a pedigree toy dog or if it hits the bag that said dog is carried around in.\u201d Today not the best for a few tins in London Fields (too cold), but also something I also enjoy doing when the sun is shining. To your actual point: I completely agree. T20 has brought plenty to our sport. Something, something, Hundred, something. 22nd over: Sri Lanka 141-1 (Karunaratne 79, Thirimanne 8) Target 335 This is just tilting back Australia\u2019s way. Behrendorff has found his range after being roughed up a bit earlier, two singles to the sweepers on the off side the only runs on offer here. The last five overs have brought 20 runs, the required rate now above seven. \u201cI know Australia are going to win this game and go top,\u201d begins Andy Bradshaw, frustratedly, I assume. \u201cBut their batting has to be a real worry. 335 after that start is pretty disappointing and a better team than Sri Lanka should be able to chase it down, unless Starc has a special day.\u201d Debatable. Nothing wrong with 335. And sure, they should have got to 350. Did you see the death bowling, though? It was quite outstanding. Important to note. 21st over: Sri Lanka 139-1 (Karunaratne 78, Thirimanne 7) Target 335 Finch may as well bowl Maxwell out here, zipping through his sixth set with just four singles taken. He\u2019s bowled six overs now for 28 runs. Perfectly acceptable. 20th over: Sri Lanka 135-1 (Karunaratne 76, Thirimanne 5) Target 335 Good from Finch to get Behrendorff back while this new partnership builds having copped some serious tap from his second and third overs during the opening power play when Perera and Karunaratne were carving it up. Four off this with three dots can only help his confidence. He has to give his captain six more dependable overs. \u201cDammit,\u201d emails Jonathan Salisbury, for mozzing Perera moments before he fell. The commentator curse works on the OBO as well. On this, I stitched up Aaron Finch a beauty on radio earlier, rattling off all the player he was about to overtake just as he was dismissed. I\u2019ve burned Mitch Marsh DOZENS of times like this. 19th over: Sri Lanka 131-1 (Karunaratne 73, Thirimanne 4) Target 335 Maxwell is into his fifth over now, which is good news for Aaron Finch. He\u2019s keeping them relatively quiet, happy to pluck off singles. Oh, that\u2019s until the final delivery when he gives just enough width to Karunaratne, who uses it to steer the off-spinner down to the third man rope. Sri Lanka require 6.58 an over from here. 18th over: Sri Lanka 123-1 (Karunaratne 67, Thirimanne 2) Target 335 Very good captaincy from Finch to get his main man Starc back on after Maxwell slowed the run rate somewhat. He\u2019s sticking with him here after drinks Karunaratne, playing him carefully then nearly running himself out! Khawaja had to run him out there! Racing in from midwicket, the Aussie No3 had plenty of time to collect and underarm from about eight minutes but he\u2019s missed. Michael Clarke notes the medical tape on Khawaja\u2019s hand and says that \u201cso many players\u201d in the Australian team have it on their fingers. \u201cIt makes such a difference when trying to throw.\u201d 17th over: Sri Lanka 122-1 (Karunaratne 66, Thirimanne 2) Target 335 Top over from Maxwell to take Australia to drinks in better shape, just two singles given as the new man Thirimanne finds his feet. 16th over: Sri Lanka 120-1 (Karunaratne 65, Thirimanne 1) Target 335 As usual, there is confusion when Thirimanne/Thirimanna is batting, his name appearing both ways depending on where you wish to look. He\u2019s off the mark first ball with a glance, Karunaratne then finishing the successful Starc over with four off through about second slip. It\u2019s not quite on purpose but it does the job. I\u2019m moving inside at drinks - it\u2019s very cold all of a sudden. Starc as his best. It takes only three balls to send down his most dangerous delivery, swinging a full ball through the gate of Perera who was trying to pop him over midwicket. Lovely delivery; not the best shot. At last, Australia has one. 15th over: Sri Lanka 112-0 (Karunaratne 58, K Perera 52) Target 335 With such a great start, this pair can now build the innings without any further risks for the time being. Six taken here from Maxwell, all along the carpet. Very good batting. \u201cHi Adam.\u201d Hi Jonathan Salisbury. \u201cBy the time you get this he\u2019ll probably be out but has anyone mentioned his 153* in the Test at Durban. The definition of \u2018in the zone\u2019, and maybe here?\u201d Not wrong. Yes, in case this passed anyone in the cricket world by, earlier this year Perera did play the innings that one mathmetician adjudged the best of all time. 14th over: Sri Lanka 106-0 (Karunaratne 54, K Perera 50) Target 335 Starc is back to replace Kane Richardson from the Vauxhall End, giving up four singles to the sweepers, the last of those a yorker that Perera does well to dig out... moving his half-century in the process! He\u2019s faced just 33 balls to get there. \u201cSri Lanka couldn\u2019t have wished for a better start,\u201d observes Mark Nicholas on telly. 13th over: Sri Lanka 102-0 (Karunaratne 52, K Perera 48) Target 335 The 100 is up and the fans are very much up and about again! They are lucky to progress without losing their captain, who is pinned on the back pad by Maxwell but because they have blown their review they can\u2019t do anything about it after Richard Illingworth says no. The TV confirms that the decision would have been overturned. Oh dear. Needless to say, this isn\u2019t dwelled on by the TV commentary (G\u2019day, Mikey Holding, if you\u2019re reading). Brian Withington is straight into my inbox on that point. \u201cWhere\u2019s Michael Holding when you need an umpiring decision dissected in the commentary box?\u201d [Jim Maxwell] Hmmmmmmmmmmmm. [/Jim Maxwell] 12th over: Sri Lanka 98-0 (Karunaratne 50, K Perera 46) Target 335 The captain moves to his half-century from 45 balls with his seventh boundary, creaming Richardson through midwicket. Looking to my right, there are quite a few neutral fans in today by the looks and they are ALL on their feet and ALL with Sri Lanka. Great stuff. This is what a World Cup is all about: loud and brilliant. \u201cDon\u2019t know about moving north from the Oval,\u201d writes Peter Rowntree. \u201cTook a squint at the weather forecast for Arundel the other night, because of the Sussex v Gloucestershire game, and unbelievably the weather forecast looks good for about a week. Lovely setting for cricket as well.\u201d Was always going to be so. 11th over: Sri Lanka 91-0 (Karunaratne 46, K Perera 43) Target 335 With the field out - four men permitted outside the circle until the end of the 40th - Maxwell is brought straight on by Finch. His overs are very important for Finch now without another all-rounder - he has to do the job. It\u2019s a very good start from him too, sending one down leg but other than that, ripping his accurate off-breaks, keeping them quiet after such a powerful end to the power play. 10th over: Sri Lanka 87-0 (Karunaratne 44, K Perera 42) Target 335 Before the appeal, Perera had the pro Sri Lankan crowd on their feet once more when pulling a ball across the line to the midwicket boundary. Have that! Richardson isn\u2019t quite quick enough to drop short unless it is right at the badge of the helmet. 87 from the power play. The perfect way to take on a big chase. They\u2019re a big shout now. NOT OUT! The technology - ultraedge - shows nothing. Australia lose their review! HAS RICHARDSON FOUND PERERA\u2019S OUTSIDE EDGE? Umpire Dar says no, Finch says yes. The latter sends it upstairs to find out for sure. Stand by. 9th over: Sri Lanka 79-0 (Karunaratne 43, K Perera 35) Target 335 This is getting a bit out of hand for Australia now; they need to break this stand up ASAP. 18 from the Behrendorff over! Perera hits a superb shot over cover to begin that goes all the way for SIX! That\u2019s the shorter side of the ground today and the wind is blowing in that direction so that\u2019s clever batting with the field up. Finch gives up the next boundary, taking a ping at Perera\u2019s stumps but with nobody backing up four overthrows help the Sri Lankan cause. To finish, Perera is at it again with a little tuck that beats short fine man for four more! After a great start, Behrendorff is really battling now. One more over in this power play, they have to keep going! 8th over: Sri Lanka 61-0 (Karunaratne 42, K Perera 18) Target 335 When talking to Kane Richardson after his World Cup debut on Thursday he wasn\u2019t sure if he would get enough chance, but with Coulter-Nile sore he\u2019s very much an important cog in the Australian machine today. There is a fair bit going on in the over too, which includes another Karunaratne tuck for four - he can\u2019t bowl there with fine leg up. The captain, not known for his lavish strokeplay, is already 42 from 34! 7th over: Sri Lanka 53-0 (Karunaratne 37, K Perera 15) Target 335 I tell you what, Sri Lanka aren\u2019t mucking around here. After taking a look at Behrendorff\u2019s first over and feeling their way through it unsuccessfully, they collect 13 this time to keep the good times rolling. Rotating the strike early in the over, Karunaratne safely hooks a bumper away for four then - in a repeat of the previous set - inside edges the next to the rope as well! He keeps the strike with a clip and the Sri Lankan fans are making a LOT of noise. Don\u2019t forget, this is where they chased down a decent Indian tally in 2017 Champions Trophy - three wickets down. \u201cSettling in for the evening here, Cricket and Crierium du Dauphin\u00e9,\u201d emails Damien McLean. \u201cI think Australia has done enough but Sri Lanka would like to make a statement even if they don\u2019t make the semi-finals. Disappointing once again from the middle order after a great start from the top. I\u2019m not the biggest Shaun Marsh fan, even though I know he has seemed at his best in ODI\u2019s of late, but replacing Marcus Stoinis? I don\u2019t think so... Cover for the top order, where you have time to get yourself in, I get that. Not at 6 though. Thoughts? Who could be a better inclusion? Maybe Mitchell Marsh if they take Stoinis out of the squad? Shuffle Warner to 6, Khawaja to open and SMarsh to first drop? I doesn\u2019t seem to be sitting right at the moment anyhow. Thanks for your work.\u201d I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll keep Marsh and Khawaja in the same XI. Today, sure. No big deal. Against England, they won\u2019t run the gauntlet with four quicks plus Maxwell. Oh, and sorry about the score misprint a couple of overs ago. The good thing about the OBO is that I\u2019ve already edited the post, so it never actually happened. 6th over: Sri Lanka 40-0 (Karunaratne 25, K Perera 14) Target 335 Pat Cummins has by far the most dot balls in the tournament so far (159 of them before today, Archer in second place about 30 or so behind) but he\u2019s going around a little bit today to begin. Karunaratne does as Perera did from this end a couple of overs ago, pulling a short ball away to the rope with real authority. Shot. A top ball in response from Cummins, jagging back and collecting an inside edge, but it misses the stumps and runs away for four more. Cummins changes up to go around the wicket, Karunaratne keeping the strike with deflecting one to third man. 5th over: Sri Lanka 30-0 (Karunaratne 16, K Perera 14) Target 335 Behrendorff starts his World Cup career with an excellent over from the Pavilion End. His left arm pace has been so effective in white-ball cricket for WA over many years, between various injuries. He twice beats the bat of Karunaratne and is also up for a leg before shout when going beyond his inside edge. The maiden is spoiled by Sri Lanka\u2019s skipper from the final ball, clipping one. Still, a lovely set to begin. \u201cAfternoon Adam.\u201d Hello Brian Withington. \u201cThe Sri Lankan openers appear determined not to die wondering. In passing, how can this possibly be the last use of the Oval in the tournament - surely some mistake?\u201d I\u2019m afraid this is correct. Just how the tournament was set up, moving from venue to venue after a clump of games. This is the fifth fixture here, it is worth remembering. We move north of the river to Lord\u2019s the week after next. 4th over: Sri Lanka 30-0 (Karunaratne 15, K Perera 14) Target 335 Cummins is back to his happy place as the artificial light completely takes over. It\u2019s very, very dark. Perera picks out the fielders on the off side a couple of times before getting down the other end via an inside edge. Karunaratne\u2019s turn, who is beaten outside the off stump when missing a cut shot, more convincing to finish with three off the front foot to cover. A tiny bit of rain falls at the end of the over as well. Surely not... 3rd over: Sri Lanka 26-0 (Karunaratne 12, K Perera 13) Target 335 Starc reverts to the toes and helmet approach after Karunaratne takes another couple from a length ball, this time to point. The yorker he sends down hits the radar at 90mph, nearly flooring the captain, then cramping him with a short one to finish. Better. 2nd over: Sri Lanka 24-0 (Karunaratne 10, K Perera 13) Target 335 This is a superb start! \u201cA statement is being made early,\u201d says Mel Jones on TV and she\u2019s spot on, Karunaratne tucking three to square, Perera smashing four to midwicket then slapping again for four more! Stand and deliver stuff, all off the front foot. 1st over: Sri Lanka 12-0 (Karunaratne 7, K Perera 4) Target 335 The skipper is off the mark first up with one to third man, albeit off the outside edge. Starc pulls out of his approach from the next ball before giving Perera enough width to cut a boundary to get his own afternoon underway. It was uppish but there is nobody at point. \u201cI like the tempo of this stroke,\u201d says Kumar Sangakkara on TV. I spoke to the Sri Lankan great on the radio call earlier today and it is fair to say he isn\u2019t a fan of the current domestic set up in his homeland. Back to Starc, who slips a quicker ball past Perera\u2019s inside edge, appealing for lbw, but it is denied with Finch also denying his quick a review. Karunaratne finishes with four of his own, timing a wonderfully timed punch off the back foot to the point rope. Excellent start. The players are on the field. Dimuth Karunaratne and Kusal Perera are opening for the Sri Lankans, Mitch Starc starting Australia off from the pavilion end. PLAY! Afternoon. Thanks, JP. 33 in the final five overs wasn\u2019t quite what Australia were hoping for after Finch, Smith and Maxwell toyed with the Sri Lankans for the ten overs prior, but they still will be satisfied with 334/7 having bee sent in at the toss. Some magnificent death bowling prevented a final surge, Udana especially classy. If Australia can defend this, it will move them to outright first on the table as we near the middle of the group stage. For Sri Lanka\u2019s part, chasing 335 down will move then into equal second (on points, not net run rate), would you believe. Looking forward to your company throughout the afternoon. I\u2019m coning to you from the front row of the outside press tributes in the OSC Stand. The Cricketeer Volunteers have just been paraded across the field with this being the final match at The Oval for the tournament. Too soon, I say. Let\u2019s talk throughout the chase. That was a peculiar old innings from Australia wasn\u2019t it? Finch and Warner looked in superb touch to begin with - the skipper in particular with his elegant drives within the V - before the introduction of de Silva slowed their momentum. Like a cyclist running out of puff riding uphill Australia just seemed unable to do anything to jolt themselves out of their growing slumber, one that accounted for the uncharacteristically somnolent Warner (26) and Khawaja (10). The introduction of Smith at the halfway mark with his side 100-2 proved the decisive moment of the innings. His energy at the crease rebooted Finch and together the pair plundered 173 in 20 overs to take the game away from Sri Lanka. Finch eventually perished for a magnificent 153 with his runs accumulated all round the wicket with all manner of craft and strength. If he has ever played better than today it must have been a fine innings to watch. Smith fell shortly afterwards for 73, the second of five dismissals in the closing eight overs as the wheels fell off somewhat for Australia. Glenn Maxwell survived the carnage to smash 46 from 25 balls but around him there was an absence of targeted slogging with Shaun Marsh\u2019s three from nine likely to draw plenty of ire. Sri Lanka deserve great credit for how they bowled late on. Udana and Malinga in particular executed their slower balls and yorkers to perfection and Udana\u2019s fielding off his own bowling to effect two run outs in an over was memorable. 334 should be plenty for Australia with their attack but it is short of what they should have achieved after such a strong start and then that massive Finch-Smith partnership. The questions that were asked of Australia\u2019s batting before this innings remain and there is work to do before the semi-finals. Find out if Sri Lanka can get themselves over the line and remain a going concern in this World Cup shortly with Adam Collins at the keys. I\u2019ll catch you again soon. Thanks for all your superb contributions. 50th over: Australia 334-7 (Maxwell 46, Starc 5) Perera to bowl the final over of the innings and it begins brilliantly with four singles and a two before Maxwell manipulates a boundary through midwicket from the final delivery. Weirdly, Sri Lanka will probably head to the interval the more upbeat of the two sides following that performance in the death overs. Still, Australia have more than enough runs to assure themselves of a semi-final berth. 49th over: Australia 324-7 (Maxwell 40, Starc 1) Superb death overs bowling from Udana and backed up by his own superb fielding. Not the conclusion to Australia\u2019s innings that they were looking for. Bad to worse for Australia. Another Udana yorker collected in his follow through but this time he throws down the striker\u2019s stumps and Cummins is out for a golden duck. The ball between that and the previous run out almost bagged a wicket too but the thick edge that spiraled off Maxwell\u2019s bat just cleared Angelo Mathews in the gully. Australia\u2019s late-innings collapse continues apace. Carey is the latest to go, run out brilliantly by Udana, the bowler gathering a superb yorker in his follow through, spinning and, on his knees, throwing down the non-striker\u2019s stumps. 48th over: Australia 317-5 (Maxwell 34, Carey 4) Another excellent death over by Malinga, seven from it, and it would have been tighter than that but for some questionable Sri Lankan fielding. Australia are going to post a total that is likely matchwinning, but again they have failed to address glaring issues with their batting. Terrific over by Udana, like Malinga before him landing a host of slower balls and yorkers to deny Australia any boundaries then jagging the wicket of a frustrated Marsh at the end of it, holding out to midwicket after labouring to just three runs from nine balls. 47th over: Australia 310-5 (Maxwell 31) Meanwhile, in other cricket news... 46th over: Australia 306-4 (Maxwell 29, Marsh 2) After the carnage of the previous over Sri Lanka will be overjoyed at Malinga\u2019s ability to concede just three singles and a leg-bye in a set full of yorkers and change-ups. 45th over: Australia 302-4 (Maxwell 27, Marsh 1) Oi oi! It\u2019s Maxy magic time! 22 from Pradeep\u2019s over. He begins short so Maxwell slaps it like a forehand smash wide of long on. The second is length and goes the journey over the bowler\u2019s head. The third is dug out for a dot but the fourth is whipped with immense bottom hand force for four through midwicket. Ball five is a full toss carted through cow corner and salt is rubbed into the wound with a top edged pull over the keeper four more. 44th over: Australia 280-4 (Maxwell 5, Marsh 1) Well, that was unexpected. A wicket and just five runs from that Malinga over. Australia\u2019s inability to put together a full 50 over innings is again coming back to haunt them. Bosh! Vintage Malinga. Perfectly executed yorker from around the wicket to Smith and even the very best struggle to play them. Two quick wickets to Sri Lanka and that may buy them some hope at the innings break. Excellent knock from Smith. Not only his 73 runs but his ability to play as Finch\u2019s foil and add some impetus to the innings following the lacklustre displays of Warner and Khawaja. 43rd over: Australia 275-3 (Smith 73, Maxwell 1) Well played skipper. A massive individual knock and with the good grace to allow us a few overs of Glenn Maxwell before the close. The fielding has been pretty ordinary. The bowling hasn\u2019t been that bad (in my opinion) especially during that middle phase led by de Silva. Like most sides in the modern era they lack an ability to force a breakthrough when a batting side takes control. No double century for Finch. He fails to pick an Udana slower ball and his mighty heave skews off the top edge and into the hands of Karunaratne at cover. Superb innings nonetheless featuring some exquisite timing, brutal hitting, and no shortage of patience as well. Top stuff. 42nd over: Australia 269-2 (Finch 152, Smith 69) Can Malinga stem the bleeding? No. Finch stands and delivers, muscling the ball through midwicket for four then Smith scythes a mighty blow across the line, sending the ball miles over cow corner accompanied by the sweetest \u201cclack\u201d you could wish to hear. That was pure ball striking. 41st over: Australia 255-2 (Finch 137, Smith 62) Smith may be the most awkward batsman in the world to bowl to once set. He ends up in such unfamiliar positions at the crease which allows him to work the ball to indefensible areas. Pradeep does nothing wrong at the start of his ninth over but a leg stump yorker ends up beating square-leg for four then length on off stump disappears to the third-man boundary. A single brings Finch on strike and with it creativity replaced by brute force. Poor Pradeep has nowhere to go as Finch wallops him over cover for a one bounce four then pulls him disdainfully for four more. 40th over: Australia 237-2 (Finch 137, Smith 53) Here we go! Finch has been winding up for a few overs now and he enters tee-off beast mode with a mighty heave across the line, depositing Perera into the stand behind square leg. He follows that up with a powerful cut for four. 39th over: Australia 224-2 (Finch 126, Smith 51) Pradeep\u2019s back for another dart but he\u2019s powerless to stop the insatiable Steve Smith from reaching his eighth 50 in ten World Cup matches. He might have been out of international cricket for a year but he hasn\u2019t missed a beat on his return. Impossible to bowl to and his intent has revitalised Australia\u2019s innings. 38th over: Australia 218-2 (Finch 122, Smith 49) This partnership is operating effectively at the moment. Smith is happy to rotate the strike and Finch is happy to smite boundaries, the latest a sledgehammer of a square drive. Remember when I asked if he could make 200+? In response to Stephen Barnes (35th over) the mysterious Yum has an answer. \u201cThe former is the most heinous possible for the bowling side which is obvious if a wicket falls. Further logic would say that a front foot no ball would rate fairly highly on the heinousness scale because it is in fact cheating, in the sense of being able to get the ball to the batter an inch faster.\u201d And so does Geoff Wignall: \u201cI guess the logic is that if the batsman knew at the time of delivery that a ball would be called wide he or she would leave it alone and avoid any risk of being caught, whereas with early warning of a no-ball they\u2019d throw everything at it without risk of dismissal.\u201d 37th over: Australia 210-2 (Finch 116, Smith 47) It\u2019s getting a little gloomy at the Oval. The lights are on and the wind\u2019s up. I wonder if we\u2019re in for a shower at some point? Udana enjoys the change in conditions, sending down a ball that makes the rare journey past the outside edge of Smith\u2019s bat but he can\u2019t complete the set to Finch, his final delivery ending up at the extra cover fence after the Aussie skipper was allowed enough room to free his arms. 36th over: Australia 203-2 (Finch 111, Smith 45) The second and final drinks break heralds what should be a 15-over thrash to the line for Australia. It begins promisingly for the defending champions with a thick edge from Smith sending Perera to the third-man fence for four. 35th over: Australia 194-2 (Finch 108, Smith 39) Australia\u2019s decision to attack is eased by Sri Lanka\u2019s to recall Udana. Finch has looked to attack the left-arm paceman all day and he cracks another drive through extra cover to keep momentum flowing his side\u2019s way. \u201cWhat is the logic of a free hit for a no ball but not for a wide?\u201d asks Stephen Barnes. \u201cSurely the latter is a more heinous crime? (Another sole buddy word pair, incidentally).\u201d 34th over: Australia 190-2 (Finch 104, Smith 39) Sri Lanka are under the pump a bit now so they turn to Perera whose heavy line and length helped wrestle back control earlier in the day. He does a decent job but this match is now all about Australia deciding when to launch for home. With Glenn Maxwell padded up they don\u2019t want to waste too many overs nudging ones and twos. 33rd over: Australia 183-2 (Finch 102, Smith 36) Siriwardana\u2019s second over instills little confidence he deserves a third. Finch\u2019s six to reach his ton was dismissive. After that session in the doldrums Australia are sailing along at a rate of knots again. Aaron Finch brings up his century with a clean strike over long-off for six. This has been an innings of three parts but deserving of three figures. Superb batting by the Australian skipper. 32nd over: Australia 176-2 (Finch 95, Smith 35) Malinga overpitches first ball of his sixth over and Finch presents the full face of his bat with enough encouragement to add four to his total. It\u2019s a messy over for Sri Lanka, containing a wide and a no-ball for failing to adhere to the Powerplay fielding restrictions. \u201cIs it not ridiculous that a wide ball is given when a ball goes down the leg side off a spinner?\u201d asks David Brown. \u201cThis ball is food and drink to a decent under 13 batsman but Australia are awarded a run and an extra ball when Finch fails to connect with a de Silva long hop.\u201d It remains, as it always has been, a batsman\u2019s game. 31st over: Australia 168-2 (Finch 94, Smith 30) Siriwardana is invited to bowl his left-arm spin but he has the misfortune of bowling to Smith with his eye in. His first delivery is worked away behind square for four and there\u2019s only one dot thereafter. 30th over: Australia 159-2 (Finch 93, Smith 22) Australia\u2019s counterpunch prompts the return of Malinga back into the attack and he delivers a boundaryless over, one full of those shots from Smith that look suicidal - stepping to off and uncovering his pegs - but end in easy ones and twos. Peter Salmon again: \u201cTo Paul Griffin - I am a copy-editor, and hate the hyphen too. Unfortunately it is still standard in most style guides, so I tend to use it, but the hyphen in general is slowly being excised from the English language, retained only in cases where there is a possible ambiguity, which I don\u2019t think there is in copy-editor. I\u2019ve unilaterally decided to get rid of all hyphens in \u2018-ly\u2019 words for instance, eg. newly-wed - the \u2018-ly\u2019 makes it obvious the second word is modified by the first. We can all make a small difference.\u201d 29th over: Australia 152-2 (Finch 91, Smith 18) Intent is such an interesting phenomenon in cricket. Australia began with lots of it then watched it ebb away, but since Steve Smith came out it\u2019s returned again. After upping the ante in previous minutes the big over arrives, Finch taking de Silva to task for 4,6,6, in a rare flurry of brute force. Quite why Australia allowed themselves to be so becalmed for that spell remains a mystery, especially when Finch shows such control with his hitting. 28th over: Australia 132-2 (Finch 73, Smith 17) Michaels Clarke and Slater are on commentary together. In the blink of an eye the subject turns to Bon Jovi. That chat is mercifully cut short by Smith\u2019s intent converting to four runs with a well-timed square drive. Udana is again the bowler to concede runs. 27th over: Australia 124-2 (Finch 71, Smith 11) Smith is starting to work through the gears, hustling and shuffling like a toddler ready for the loo. De Silva\u2019s accuracy restricts Australia to singles but there\u2019s a change of vibe out in the middle after that long spell of Sri Lankan control. 26th over: Australia 119-2 (Finch 69, Smith 9) Udana\u2019s back into the attack but he sends down the first over in an age that Australia find easy to score from, Smith in particular getting into line early and showing intent. The highlight is a whip to midwicket for four that he took from around off stump after stepping a mile to off to the left-arm over bowler. Paul Griffin\u2019s joined in: \u201cForgive the impertinent pedantry but are we sure that \u201ccopy-editor\u201d should be hyphenated? I\u2019m on Greek beach and have neglected to pack a style guide. This also explains the mauve swimwear, with which the locals remain unwowed (or possibly un-wowed?).\u201d 25th over: Australia 110-2 (Finch 67, Smith 2) Any thoughts of that mighty hit breaking the shackles are quickly dashed by de Silva\u2019s sixth over and his latest demonstration of control on a two-paced surface. \u201cI would just like to point out to Bill Pairman that not all dells are dingly. Some, at least, are bosky.\u201d Thanks Martin Wright. 24th over: Australia 108-2 (Finch 66, Smith 1) This is a splendid duel between Pradeep and Finch. The bowler has enjoyed the upper hand for a while now and again challenges Australia\u2019s skipper but the over ends with Finch pulling hard to a delivery outside the line of off stump that bounced grille-high. He connected superbly and the ball soared behind square leg for a much needed six. \u201cSplendid stuff from Peter Salmon,\u201d commends Brian Withington. \u201cI found myself wanting to see \u2018spittle\u2019 (partner, \u2018lick\u2019) amongst his list of fossil/binomial words but not sure if it qualifies? His reference to once in an era words had me segueing to the sort of (very) occasional bowler that you let loose just once in a competition, probably in the grand final when the chips are down, introduced ominously by the umpire as \u2018right arm, hapax legomenon\u2019.\u201d All that pressure has earned another wicket, and another for de Silva. Khawaja looked to break the shackles, slog-sweeping firmly but straight into the hands of the midwicket sweeper. 23rd over: Australia 100-2 (Finch 60, Smith 0) 22nd over: Australia 97-1 (Finch 56, Khawaja 10) Sri Lanka are now well on top of this passage of play and Pradeep is all over Australia, appealing unsuccessfully for an edge against Khawaja then whistling one through Finch\u2019s unconvincing pull before testing Khawaja\u2019s reflexes with a slippery lifter. 21st over: Australia 95-1 (Finch 55, Khawaja 9) Brendon McCullum on commentary has mentioned how the Oval can exhibit \u201cspongy\u201d bounce on occasion and it does appear that may be a factor in Australia\u2019s declining run-rate. Especially against spin the ball is just holding up or popping up, forcing the batsmen to check their drives and reconsider any abandon. \u201cI refer John Starbuck (over 17) to oxforddictionaries.com: In the phrase wrought havoc, as in they wrought havoc on the countryside, wrought is an archaic past tense of work and is not, as is sometimes assumed, a past tense of wreak.\u201d Thanks, Andy Killeen. 20th over: Australia 93-1 (Finch 54, Khawaja 8) Sensing an opportunity to strike Karunaratne recalls Pradeep and it so nearly does the trick. The opener begins his second spell by beating Khawaja\u2019s outside edge, then he finds a thick edge next ball before the normal service of tight lines and watchful batting resumes. Ok, so I\u2019ve been out of my depth with all this wordplay for a while, but this from Dom Cole might have tipped me into delirium. \u201cSurely it should be hapax legomena and not hapax legomenons. Though There are perhaps different criterions to support the other point of view.\u201d 19th over: Australia 87-1 (Finch 53, Khawaja 3) More of the same: decent bowling, conservative batting, and de Silva restricts Australia to four singles. My favourite OBO emailing homonym Matt Dony is around. \u201cCalling back to Ian Forth\u2019s musings on nouns that are followed by their adjective, I once \u2018enjoyed\u2019 a lively debate about \u2018Gins and tonic\u2019 vs \u2018Gin and tonics.\u2019 I guess it all comes down to how you treat the word \u2018tonic\u2019. If it is an abbreviation of \u2018Tonic water\u2019, then that\u2019s where the plural sits. But if it\u2019s being used in terms of its effect on the gin, that it acts as a tonic to the gin, then \u2018Gin\u2019 gets the S. Either way, it wroted havoc on the bar order.\u201d 18th over: Australia 83-1 (Finch 51, Khawaja 1) Aaron Finch shrugs off the loss of his opening partner to reach his third half-century of this World Cup. He looked superbly early on but has since been becalmed. Australia really have relinquished the impetus here. It may be decent bowling, it may be the pitch becoming a tad two-paced once the hardness of the new ball has disappeared, but there\u2019s a diminishing amount of intent on display at the crease. Brian Withington again: \u201cApparently \u2018havoc\u2019 is a military order permitting seizure of goods after victory, as in Mark Antony\u2019s call of \u2018Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war\u2019. A good rallying call in the dressing room before unleashing a pack of fast bowlers on a lively green top. By the way, I think Mark (Charles Jefford) Nicholas could just about pull off the Mr Darcy role in the commentary box.\u201d 17th over: Australia 80-1 (Finch 49, Khawaja 0) No messing around today, Khawaja is in at three. John Starbuck\u2019s returned, drawing a line from Richard I to Buffy, as you do. \u201c\u2018Time immemorial\u2019 is a well-established legal phrase, used to refer to English statute law dating from the reign of Richard I. This is an inaccurate credit to Richard, who didn\u2019t much care for England except as a money source for fighting wars, but leaves out his father Henry II who pulled together and created the foundations of our current legal set-up. Also, I don\u2019t much care for \u2018wreaked\u2019 as a past tense. It probably comes from American usage, who are notoriously poor at handling irregular verbs. An early episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer demonstrates this, with Anthony Head having to say \u2018slayed\u2019 should be used instead of \u2018slain\u2019; while it was in the script and he didn\u2019t have much choice, he should still be thoroughly ashamed.\u201d Sri Lanka have been tightening the tourniquet slowly over a number of overs and it finally pays dividends. Australia\u2019s openers have been content working ones and twos against some solid bowling but the moment Warner looks to improvise he\u2019s undone. Stepping back and across he gives himself room to cut de Silva but doesn\u2019t pick the quicker arm ball that skids through and sends the zing bails skywards. Excellent bowling from the spinner and a reward for a long spell of patient cricket from Sri Lanka. 16th over: Australia 79-0 (Warner 26, Finch 48) Another solid over from Perera and Sri Lanka. It\u2019s been a while since we saw a boundary. The bowlers are landing in good areas and the batters are respecting it. Tidy cricket. 15th over: Australia 76-0 (Warner 25, Finch 46) Time for spin with Dhananjaya de Silva brought on from the Vauxhall end and it\u2019s a promising start, especially to Warner with the right-arm bowler coming around the wicket and making a couple misbehave, forcing rare false shots. Nothing of great alarm for the batsmen, but in the context of their serene progress so far worth keeping a close eye on. David Farrelly must be tired or wired. \u201cIt is 4:15 ish am here in the Rockies so apologies if I lower the tenor of the conversation; but didn\u2019t Titus Andronicus invoke the gods to send down justice to wreak our wrongs? Or was that Shane Warne?\u201d I think Warnie was sent down to tweak our wrong\u2019uns wasn\u2019t he? Boom and indeed tish. Try the veal. 14th over: Australia 73-0 (Warner 24, Finch 44) Sri Lanka are enjoying a decent spell with Udana and Perera after Australia\u2019s confident start. Length has been key and Perera is again in the right areas, restricting Warner and Finch to a diet of singles. 13th over: Australia 69-0 (Warner 22, Finch 42) Udana continues his tidy spell. Nothing fancy going on, just consistent line and length keeping Australia honest. The grammar chat really has got you all interested, hasn\u2019t it? Back to Peter Salmon: \u201cBeing a copy-editor, I\u2019m enjoying the word chat as much as the cricket. What you\u2019ve got with \u2018wreak/havoc\u2019 is a binomial. \u2018Dingly\u2019 is a fossil word - one which only occurs in one context (often in a binomial) - other examples include bygones, champing, eke, fettle, fro, kith, petard, riddance, shebang, spick and yore - I won\u2019t supply the context. Then of course there is the rare hapax legomenon - words which appear only once in a era, community, text or oeuvre - Shakespeare only ever used \u2018satyr\u2019 once. There\u2019s about 400 hapax legomenons in the Hebrew Bible, and they get acsribed a fair bit of significance in that Hebrew Bible sort of way.\u201d We should OBO Countdown sometime. 12th over: Australia 63-0 (Warner 21, Finch 37) Better from Perera, including that very tight LBW appeal. An over of heavily bowled length deliveries that Australia are happy in the main to play from the crease with angled bats in search of ones and twos behind square. One of the joys of the OBO is unearthing the likes of Nick Cherkas. \u201cThe term is \u201ccollocation\u201d; words which are frequently found together. The example of \u201cwreak havoc\u201d is a strong collocation, as those words are, as we\u2019ve seen, good mates. Collocations are great fun and, for those learning English, arguably more important to be aware of than grammatical rules. They help in building vocabulary, as in \u201cslip fielder\u201d (a strong collocation) and \u201cmaiden over\u201d (a fairly strong collocation).\u201d It looked optimistic in real time but it was much closer than I expected on review. Perera struck Finch\u2019s front pad on the press forward and the ball was going on to hit the stumps but the batsman was saved by umpire\u2019s call for contact point outside the line of off stump. Perera calls for a review of an LBW shout against Finch that was declined onfield... 11th over: Australia 57-0 (Warner 20, Finch 35) Udana again does well, landing his left-arm over pace on a decent length around a testing fourth stump line. However, there is no indication Australia will lose a wicket any time soon. 10th over: Australia 53-0 (Warner 17, Finch 34) It\u2019s a double change for Sri Lanka with Perera entering the attack but he is popgun to Finch on a surface this true. The Aussie skipper tucks in, hitting sweetly and with poise through the line of the ball to collect fours through the covers and point. I\u2019ve never seen Finch bat better than this. He could end with 200+. \u201cThinking of havoc and that mighty cricketing legend The Judge. I am put in mind not so much the havoc wrought by Robin Smith back in the day as the havoc wrought by that bloody Ray Illingworth, who if memory serves me correctly was the self styled supremo of English cricket who did so little for so many England players. I am thinking Tuffnell, Malcolm, Smith, Hick, Ramprakash; well all those who played during that era. Illingworth was such a self righteous known all, I think he managed to get the worst out of a lot of teams and players. He wroak a whole load of havoc.\u201d Gah! Thanks for the PTSD flashback Charlie Jeffery. 9th over: Australia 44-0 (Warner 16, Finch 26) Udana has recovered well enough from his early injury to join the attack and he begins smartly, restricting Australia\u2019s openers to just a single. Brian Withington is in the building. \u201cIan Forth\u2019s splendid literary references to Isa Guha had me wandering further back and idly picturing a Pride and Prejudice mash up in the commentary box, with Elizabeth Bennett and Mr Darcy exchanging zingers during the high tea interval. Expertly acerbic analysis laced with smoulderingly repressed sexual tension - what\u2019s not to like?\u201d I can picture it now... Darcy: \u201cShe is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me - outside off stump.\u201d 8th over: Australia 43-0 (Warner 15, Finch 26) Australia are turning the screw here, presenting the full face of the bat to every delivery, selecting their shots well, and playing with that puffed out chest masculinity that so intimidates opponents. Warner converts that equation into four runs off Pradeep\u2019s first delivery, crunching it square, then he and Finch rotate the strike with ease. Finch does so holding every shot long after the ball has entered the fielding side\u2019s purview in another intimidatory display of body language. Back to words with - and without - friends... \u201cImmemorial prefers to hang out with \u2018time\u2019 in the vocabulary playground,\u201d offers Ian Forth, \u201cbut also allows us to pivot to adjectives that come after their nouns. See also \u2018court martial\u2019, \u2018poet laureate\u2019 and \u2018attorney general\u2019. A lesser man than me would make a cheap joke about David Warner and \u2018something fishy\u2019 but fortunately I\u2019m better than that.\u201d \u201cI would like to point out that I am pretty sure that the past tense of \u201cwreak havoc\u201d is surely \u201cwreaked havoc\u201d ! As in Botham wreaked havoc against Australia in 1981.\u201d Thanks Ralph Jennings (but don\u2019t forget Bob). 7th over: Australia 33-0 (Warner 8, Finch 25) Yet another sumptuous straight drive for four from Finch who is timing the ball gloriously this morning. Malinga responds by moving around the wicket in an effort to force the Australian skipper to play outside his V. Finch declines the offer, drilling another four straight through mid-off who - to misquote an old World Cup goals video I once had - was as much use as a lace curtain interrupting the path of a bullet. 6th over: Australia 23-0 (Warner 8, Finch 15) Better from Pradeep who lands an over on a tight line and length to keep Australia honest. Some quick housekeeping: the pitch is doing nothing, and neither is the ball. \u201cI think \u2018wreak\u2019 is very happy to work with \u2018vengeance\u2019 as well as \u2018havoc\u2019\u201d emails Tim Wiseman. Is it just me or did reading that provoke the image of Samuel L Jackson in Pulp Fiction in everyone? 5th over: Australia 20-0 (Warner 6, Finch 14) Another tight Malinga over respected by Australia\u2019s openers. The only delivery of note was a slower ball that just held up on the surface and forced a checked drive from Warner that almost induced a c&amp;b. Isuru Udana is back on the field. \u201cAs an Indian born in this century, I experienced neither the pleasure of watching Robin Smith live nor the pain of witnessing yet another Indian bowling attack getting pummeled all around the ground in the 90s,\u201d emails Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cBut I have watched highlights featuring Mr Smith in the past, and the one you have provided today solidifies my opinion: he was rather good.\u201d Delighted you agree. As I\u2019ve mentioned before he was one of my first cricketing idols and his yellow bat grip was the first item of cricketing equipment I selected to emulate a professional. Unfortunately I was, and remain, cack with bat in hand. 4th over: Australia 17-0 (Warner 4, Finch 13) The ball is finding the middle of Finch\u2019s bat regularly, and most of the time with the kind of timing normally associated with Deontay Wilder and another man\u2019s jaw. Pradeep does some excellent fielding off his own bowling to deny another on-driven four but there\u2019s nothing he can do with a boundary clipped forward of midwicket. Isuru Udana did his best trying to haul that shot in before the rope but he failed, and in doing so dived headlong into the LCD advertising boards, jarring his left shoulder in the process. He has now left the field in some discomfort. 3rd over: Australia 12-0 (Warner 4, Finch 8) In a sign of Warner\u2019s new-found maturity he\u2019s happy to allow Malinga to sling down a maiden, respecting the line and length and his inability to pierce the infield with those meaty defensive-ish strokes of his. \u201cAnother interesting aspect of \u2018wreaking havoc\u2019 is that there is no proper past tense,\u201d emails John Starbuck. \u201cYou have to use \u2018wrought havoc\u2019 or adopt versions of \u2018play havoc (with)\u2018. Havoc is obviously a difficult customer.\u201d 2nd over: Australia 12-0 (Warner 4, Finch 8) Goodness me, how\u2019s the touch from Aaron Finch!? First delivery of the day from Nuwan Pradeep is on a decent line and length but the Aussie skipper stands tall and caresses a textbook off drive on the up for four: think vintage Michael Vaughan. Four balls later he times another sweet sweet boundary, this one driven with the full face of the bat past the non-striker in a stroke that Finch holds for so long it looks as though the wind has caught him and he might never change. This would actually be fine because it was such a glorious follow through to a perfect on drive. \u201cNice shout out for words with only one friend\u201d emails Bill Pairman. \u201cMy favourite is \u201cdingly dell\u201d which works both ways. The only dingly thing is a dell, all dells are dingly. They\u2019re like an elderly couple who have been together since childhood, ever-faithful to each other, still as deeply enamoured as the day they first kissed.\u201d Very high standard of emails this morning. High fives all round. 1st over: Australia 4-0 (Warner 4, Finch 0) Malinga opens from the Vauxhall end and he begins superbly, swinging one into Warner\u2019s pads then beating the outside edge with a length delivery. Warner is typically unfussed, clipping the next off his pads through midwicket with a firm push that races away for four like it\u2019s hopped on an airport travelator. This is a fast outfield. Aaron Finch and David Warner are out in the middle. Lasith Malinga has the white ball in his hand. There\u2019s plenty of blue sky among the fluffy clouds in south London. Time for cricket. If today\u2019s lopsided looking contest fails to deliver, just wait until tomorrow... It is a match that \u2013 on the surface at least \u2013 is just one of 48 at this rain-splattered Cricket World Cup. But when India and Pakistan face off in Manchester on Sunday the sporting contest will be magnified and warped by so much else: the 70-plus years of shared history and antipathy between the two countries, the recent political tensions in Kashmir, and the stultifying pressure that comes when several hundred million eyeballs are watching on. Anthem time. A quick opportunity to inform you that today\u2019s officials are Aleem Dar and Richard Illingworth with Michael Gough keeping his eye on DRS. \u201cMy new number one cricket journo is without doubt Isa Guha. She has the ironic air of a daughter in an Ivy Compton-Burnett novel - trapped inside a Victorian country house with her father, a tyrannical male landowner, and his bumptious son, with only her native wit and charm available to combat them.\u201d I told you Ian Forth logging on was good, didn\u2019t I? Isa Guha is indeed brilliant. In Australia she is often saddled with some unenviable commentary box assignments which he handles with a grace I doubt I could emulate. Just staying with The Judge a little longer, it may well contain the greatest cover quote of all time from Mike Selvey in reference to Smith\u2019s famed Square Cut. \u201cShould I ever be condemned to beheading, I would like Robin Smith to be the swordsman,\u201d he wrote. Brilliant. \u201cPleased to see the word \u2018pundit\u2019 here,\u201d emails Peter Salmon. \u201cMy friends and I got obsessed with the word a while ago in relation to Aussie Rules football - we loved that the pundits were always \u2018being proved wrong\u2019. Looking into the etymology it turns out pundit comes from the Sanskrit \u2018pandita\u2019, meaning a teacher of any field of knowledge in Hinduism particularly the Vedic scriptures, dahrma, Hindi philosophy, or secular subjects such as music. So it seemed eminently reasonable they didn\u2019t know much about Aussie Rules, hence getting it wrong. More generally it means \u2018knowledge owner\u2019 and I have to say Alistair Cook\u2019s first stint on the wireless yesterday showed him as a pretty good \u2018knowledge owner.\u2019\u201d I haven\u2019t heard much from the Chef so I\u2019ll withhold judgement, but I\u2019m delighted he\u2019s made a good start to life behind the mic. The last time I was on here (Australia vs Pakistan) I shared that Robin Smith was one of my cricketing heroes growing up. That was in reference to a new autobiography being published about Smith\u2019s eventful life (written with OBO guru Rob Smyth). Smith recently spoke to Donald McRae and provided a glimpse at how raw some passages of The Judge are likely to be. \u201cWhat do you think about Lasit Malinga?\u201d asks CS Pancham. \u201cWill he cause problems for Australian batsmen?\u201d I would expect so, yes. I think he\u2019s a terrific bowler and ideally suited to the kinds of pitches we\u2019ve seen so far this tournament which have benefited that two-length approach (very full or very short). He averages 24.65 against Australia in ODIs with a strike rate of two wickets per ten overs. Ian Forth has logged on, which is always an enjoyable moment on the OBO. \u201cOB Jato makes a very pertinent point but my eye was drawn to \u201cwreck havoc\u201d. It\u2019s more usually \u201cwreak havoc\u201d but wreak\u2019s one of those funny words that only really likes hanging out with one friend, to wit, in its case, \u2018havoc\u2019. See also: \u2018fell swoop\u2019; Adil Rashid and Moeen Ali; Teresa May and her cat.\u201d One change also for Sri Lanka with Milinda Siriwardana replacing Suranag Lakmal. That means doubts over both Nuwan Pradeep (injured finger) and Lasith Malinga (flew home to attend funeral) have been resolved with the two bowlers making the starting line. Sri Lanka XI: Dimuth Karunaratne (c), Lahiru Thirimanne, Kusal Perera (wk), Kusal Mendis, Angelo Mathews, Dhananjaya de Silva, Thisara Perera, Isuru Udana, Milinda Siriwardana, Nuwan Pradeep, Lasith Malinga One change to Australia\u2019s line-up with Jason Behrendorff replacing Nathan Coulter-Nile. Finch indicated the hero of his side\u2019s win over the Windies was a little stiff and sore. That still means a four-man pace attack with ten overs to be found from Glenn Maxwell, Aaron Finch, or even the lesser spotted Steve Smith, who was seen rolling his arm over in the nets this week. Australia XI: Aaron Finch (c), David Warner, Usman Khawaja, Steve Smith, Shaun Marsh, Glenn Maxwell, Alex Carey (wk), Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Jason Behrendorff, Kane Richardson. Aaron Finch called incorrectly (his fifth lost toss in a row this World Cup) and Dimuth Karunaratne wasted no time sticking Australia in. Finch agreed with the strategy suggesting he would also have bowled first to take advantage of some overcast conditions and any life in the new pitch. Want to know what the Oval\u2019s like behind the scenes? Of course you do! And as luck would have it here\u2019s Mark Butcher to show you around. This is also an opportunity for me to segue into nominating Butch as my favourite cricketing pundit (and your chance to email or tweet me with your alternatives - with supporting information, of course). I\u2019ve long enjoyed his well-informed perspective on the game, his ability to move with the times, and most crucially how he argues his point confidently but respectfully in a manner that advances debate. This is a lovely read from Barney Ronay on the presence of rain during the early phase of this World Cup. Rain tells you the summer game is also about melancholy and boredom, that this is a story told often in minor chords too, its moments of colour bordered by vital passages of grey. In the current battle for the sport\u2019s soul rain stands on one side saying this is not a product to be sold by the yard. Formats will come and go. But you have to be made to love cricket, not simply offered it up ready-made. In England, at least, the uncertainty remains. Cricket will always fight with the skies. If you missed any of yesterday\u2019s action you can catch up here in written and audio formats. TLDR: England hammered the Windies but Roy and Morgan picked up injuries. \u201cSri Lanka\u2019s pacers could wreck unlikely havoc today, but I am concerned with only one query regarding Australia right now,\u201d emails OB Jato, \u201cStoinis?\u201d. Indeed, Australia\u2019s line-up is unbalanced without their allrounder and the selection strategy against Pakistan did not look like one capable of winning a World Cup. Marcus Stoinis remains unavailable for selection with the side strain he suffered against India but he is expected to return to training next week. Mel Jones has had a look at the pitch for Australian TV and she likes what she sees. It\u2019s a fresh surface and Jones reckons it\u2019ll have plenty of pace, unlike the worn tracks that have been used at the Oval so far this tournament that have lacked the venue\u2019s customary pace and bounce. Let\u2019s get the weather out of the way early - it\u2019s dry, and it is forecast to remain dry for the majority of play with just the slight risk of a shower during the afternoon. It\u2019s a bit nippy out still though with the temperature unlikely to get out of the teens while a brisk southerly will keep everyone on their toes. Hello everybody and welcome to match 20 of Cricket World Cup 2019 featuring Australia and Sri Lanka from the Oval. For Sri Lanka it\u2019s the first in a series of intimidating must-win fixtures if they are to make the semi-finals. After suffering a hammering at the hands of a merciless New Zealand in their tournament opener Sri Lanka have endured the misfortune of consecutive washouts against Pakistan and Bangladesh, two opponents they would have fancied their chances against. Results are now required against four of the top five ranked teams in ODI cricket, starting with the defending champions. For Australia it\u2019s a welcome chance to tinker with their sub-optimal approach before the knockout phase. The good news for Justin Langer is his big names have delivered under pressure, notably David Warner with the bat and Mitchell Starc with the ball, but the drop off in standard from the stars to the role players has been alarming. Moreover, there still appears a lack of clarity in selection and strategy leading to Usman Khawaja hovering like a bad smell in the batting order and captain Aaron Finch pressganged into lobbing down some auxiliary overs. The best of their best has largely been good enough to paper over cracks so far but the form of the other likely semi-finalists suggests improvement across the board is required for a sixth Australian triumph since 1987. Start time is 10.30am local (7.30pm AET) which means there\u2019s plenty of time to chew the fat about all things CWC beforehand. If you would like to contribute (and like Mr Kipling\u2019s cakes your input so far this tournament has been exceedingly good) you can send me an email or a tweet and I will do my best to add you to the coverage."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
