Some of it is to do with a philosophical shift. Barack Obama's just-announced drug tsar appointment, Gil Kerlikowske, pioneered a harm-reduction strategy while running the Seattle police department, and Obama himself is on record opposing current marijuana laws and defending medical marijuana laws. Virginia senator Jim Webb has been pushing legislation designed to scale back the size of America's burgeoning incarceration infrastructure, through channelling non-violent offenders into alternatives to incarceration and reducing sentence lengths, among other reforms. There's much talk in Washington these days about giving troubled teens and drug addicts better access to rehab programmes. Philosophically, it's a huge shift in emphasis from the un-nuanced tough-on-crime language perfected by both political parties over the last generation. Like so many others of the tectonic political shifts going on these days, however, in the end this one is coming down to economics. After a third of a century in which counties have ratcheted up their jail populations, states their state prison populations and the federal bureau of prisons its own inmate population, lawmakers are realising that keeping 2.3 million people behind bars costs an awful lot of cash. And, unlike in the past, when it was possible to keep raising expenditures in the face of public anxiety about crime, these days states and counties are falling over themselves to shed spending obligations. Last year, Kentucky granted early release to nearly 2,000 inmates. Alabama and several other states have begun releasing elderly and terminally ill inmates. Elsewhere, corrections officials have called for a review of mandatory sentencing laws that have the effect of inflating prisoner numbers or have urged that more drug offenders be diverted into non-prison-based rehab centres. Nowhere, however, has the battle over prisoner numbers acquired the same urgency as in California. For years, the state's prison system has been the subject of intense legal disputes. The state is under court orders to dramatically improve both medical and mental healthcare for inmates, and a \"special master\" appointed by the courts to enforce medical improvements has aroused the wrath of the state's political leadership by suggesting the state will have to spend many billions of dollars to render the care constitutional. With a state budget deficit set to exceed $40bn and a correctional budget now topping $10bn \u2013 threatening to exceed the amount spent on higher education by the state \u2013 few in California's state capital, Sacramento, have any desire to channel more dollars to the prisons. The problem is, a three-judge panel has been hearing a lawsuit arguing that the state's prisons are now so overcrowded \u2013 many house more than twice the number of prisoners they were designed to handle, with prisoners often stacked three bunks high in hallways and gyms \u2013 that the overcrowding itself is rendering conditions unconstitutional. Seeking to pre-empt the court's ruling, late last year governor Arnold Schwarzenegger proposed a modest package of changes intended to reduce the prisoner population by about 20,000. The plan was attacked by legislators, and the governor backed off. Now, however, they might wish they had shown more flexibility. Last week, the three federal judges issued a tentative ruling. They intended to find, the ruling declared, that the prison overcrowding was indeed unconstitutional, and they would mandate the state find a way to reduce its prisoner population of 170,000 by 55,000 within three years. The court is going to leave it up to the state to work out how to achieve these reductions, but they will likely entail early releases, a revamping of the parole system and the diversion of increasing numbers of offenders into halfway houses, jails and other settings. The political reaction has been swift and furious. Politicians might not be in a prison-funding mood these days, but that doesn't mean they want a mass release of inmates onto their constituencies' streets. The state will, attorney general Jerry Brown announced, appeal the ruling up to the US supreme court. My guess is there'll be a compromise in the end, perhaps one that looks something like Schwarzenegger's plan from last year. California will end up with fewer prisoners, not just because the courts say so, but also because it's running out of other options to cut spending and fix its budget hole. After decades in which prison reformers have tried to get the public angry about the moral implications of wholesale incarceration, in the end it's all coming downs to dollars and cents. The big question now is whether the released inmates will have access to proper drug treatment, mental health and job training services on the outside, or whether they \u2013 like the deinstitutionalised mental hospital residents of 40 years ago \u2013 will simply be left to fend for themselves."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
