It is now an onstage event with choral and orchestral backing and star-name contributions including Antony Hegarty. Artist and film-maker Julian Schnabel designed the stage show and directed this movie record of a 2006 performance in New York. The original album, almost Stygian in its murkiness and gloom, spoke of dark passions in the setting of Wall-era Berlin: a tragic obsession with a woman who was to fall prey to drug abuse, domestic violence and prostitution. The resulting performance appears to me every bit as dark and unforgiving, and although the theatrical space allows its themes to breathe more, there is an authentic tang of early-1970s self-indulgence to be savoured here. However, it is certainly an event, and Lou Reed's unmistakable lilting groan has real pain in it, hinting at a real but undisclosed personal story behind the music."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
