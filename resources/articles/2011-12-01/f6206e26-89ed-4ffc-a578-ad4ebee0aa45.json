Arsenal have not finished below their neighbours since 1994-95 although, after their 1-0 defeat at Manchester City, they trail them by five points and Tottenham have a game in hand. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, the Arsenal manager, appeared to concede after the loss at City, which cast them 12 points off the top of the table, that a title challenge was beyond them and feels as if the battle for supremacy in London is the more realistic challenge. Chelsea, in fourth place, separate the north London clubs. \"Not getting above Tottenham isn't even something we can think about,\" Szczesny said. \"It's not in our vocabulary. We don't want to finish below Tottenham, no matter what. That's the mentality here. That's just my personal ambition to do that. I'm one of the fans. So it means a lot to me to finish above Tottenham. And we will do so.\" Szczesny said after Tottenham's 2-1 north London derby victory at White Hart Lane on 2 October, when he blamed himself for letting in Kyle Walker's winning goal from long range, that Arsenal were a better team and Tottenham would endure a difficult period at some point. Spurs are on a run of good form, having taken 34 points from an available 39, but Szczesny still says that Harry Redknapp's team will stutter and Arsenal will take advantage. \"They've been on good condition, you have to give that to them,\" the goalkeeper said. \"But I'm confident we are a better side and will finish above them. They look good at the moment but hopefully \u2026 not hopefully \u2026 they will drop points in the second half of the season.\" There were positives for Arsenal to take in defeat at City and Szczesny, who made some vital saves, was quick to do so. He highlighted the confidence that had returned to the squad after their terrible start to the season and he dismissed the possibility that a first Premier League defeat since the derby would send them into a downward spiral. \"We've got more about us now,\" Szczesny said. \"We've had a few good results and the confidence comes back with that. This defeat certainly won't take that belief and confidence away from us. We have Aston Villa on Wednesday and then a reasonably easy run over Christmas [Wolves, QPR and Fulham] so we feel we can get a run of results together. \"I think the tough times we went through have made us stronger. We made some great signings after the poor start to the season and have got the spirit back in the team. So we feel stronger and that we can go a long way in all the competitions between now and the end of the season. \"I don't think there is a big gap in terms of quality between ourselves and City. The only difference was that they scored the goal and we didn't. I think we showed that we are just as good as the richest team in the world, possibly the best one in the league at the moment, so that gives us confidence we can beat everyone else.\" Wenger has had cause to curse his misfortune in the full-back positions, with all four of his established specialists out injured, forcing him to string four centre-halves across the back line at City and in the previous fixture at home to Everton. Johan Djourou, standing in at right-back, became yet another casualty when he went off against City with groin trouble. He will be out for at least three weeks. \"Djourou's injury gives us a new problem and unfortunately at the moment there are no solutions,\" Wenger said. Kieran Gibbs, who has been out with a stomach muscle injury, is the closest of the full-backs to a return but he is expected to miss the visit to Villa. The midfielder Alex Song, who has deputised in defence, is suspended after receiving his fifth yellow card of the season. Ignasi Miquel, the 19-year-old Spanish defender, could make his full Premier League debut."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
