The sell-out event was billed as \"The Bits-and-Pieces Boys Show Their Boys' Bits\", so Dave Podmore was up there on stage with several of the country's leading all-rounders, giving our all for a deserving cause and, I think it's fair to say, putting a contented smile on the faces of a few hundred lagered-up Kentish slappers. The performance was a tribute to the lads' professionalism because, to be honest, the atmosphere backstage beforehand was like a morgue, peckers being a very long way from up. The cause, of course, was the announcement on the dressing-room telly of the 30-strong squad for the ICC Champions Trophy this coming back end. \"What do you have to do to attract David Graveney's attention?\" asked my young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Robin Martin-Jenkins as we climbed disconsolately into our white boiler suits. \"Are we invisible or something?\" wailed Lugsy Leatherdale, adjusting his glittery-gold hard hat. Shaun Udal threw his construction worker's hammer at the teletext screen, he was so disgusted. Kabir Ali? Alex Wharf? Rikki Clarke? I ask you. Their credentials as international all-rounders do not convince Pod one bit. Put them in a saucy ladies-only cabaret situation and I'd take a small wager you'd have a queue for refunds stretching halfway up the Medway. But Grav and Duncan Fletcher just don't get it; in fact, they've had the blinkers on for a few months now. And look what we've ended up with: Paul might-stop-one-in-the-covers Collingwood, Ian pass-the-Pukka- pies Blackwell, Graham never-heard-of-him Napier. As for Robert Key, we're talking chocolate teapots, usefulness-wise, though admittedly he does pick up a few extra bob when he passes round his chubby helmet. Granted Tremlett is a sensible pick. Chris is a very tidy bowler, who once scored 43, and was a very good friend to me the night the vet put down Poddy's Pride at the old Catford dog track. \"Every mutt gets out of order once in a while, Pod,\" sympathised Trooper. \"It was just bad luck yours had to lose it during a race.\" Those words meant a lot to me. Would you count on, say, Alex Gidman to strike the right note when a mate's just lost a useful 640-metre hurdler? Would Ian Bell offer me nine quid for the skin like Troops did for his family's furriers business? Pod thinks not. Some cynics and knockers might say this is just Dave Podmore sour grapes. It's true I do have an interest in a horse of that name (Crofty, Caddy and Corky own the other three legs) but all I'm doing is voicing the deep discontent on the circuit about the one-day selection policy. I'm around the motorway network a lot, this being the high season for benefit events, and I'm in regular contact with Messrs Patel, DeFreitas, Silverwood, Hollioake and Chapple as I help them out with their casino nights, golf days, fashion shows and steam-hauled piss-ups. These are guys who, I think you'll agree, know a bit about the game. The feeling in the shires is that the basics of cricket don't change. If you can have a bad game over four days you can do it in one, if you can screw up at 20 overs you can do it in 45 and just because a guy has not played a 50-overs match before does not mean he won't have a mare when the time comes. What you need when you're 20 for five against Bangladesh is utility players who've been around the block, guys who will offer each other the kind of support that will see Dave Podmore in a DJ and Vodafone cummerbund every week night till the end of August. But lads like Silvers, Chappy and Daffy are professionals and they know there's no point in whingeing about selectors when there's a Bad Boys Nite or a spa treatment weekend at La Manga to be organised (with complementary pashminas for the ladies). They are just quietly and calmly getting on with the job of asking people for money. As for the idiots who say there is something degrading about the benefit system, ask those who attended Daffy's alternative therapy evening. Ask them if they thought it was undignified. Or ask those lasses lucky enough to have secured tickets for Daffy's hen night at the Walkers Stadium (adult entertainment by the LCCC XI). It's not them who'll be witnessing a degrading spectacle, it's the punters sat out in the snow watching England getting stuffed in the Champions Trophy.
