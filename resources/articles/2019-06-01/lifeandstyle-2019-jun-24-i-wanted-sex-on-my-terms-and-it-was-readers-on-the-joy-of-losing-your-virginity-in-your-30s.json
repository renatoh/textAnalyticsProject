She read the paragraph aloud to Owen. \u201cThe resemblance was uncanny,\u201d Owen says. When Preeta and Owen met, they were in their 30s and neither of them had had sex before. In August, they will have been married five years. When the Guardian published stories of thirtysomethings who had never had sex \u2013 and some who feared that they never would \u2013 it struck a chord with many. \u201cAs a 31-year-old virgin, it means a lot that I\u2019m not as alone as I thought,\u201d one person responded. For others, it brought back now-distant memories. Preeta, now 39, and Owen, 38, met through an online dating agency for busy professionals. He was the fourth man she had been introduced to, and her fifth date. On the day, she had been thinking of cancelling. \u201cI\u2019d had a horrific day at work, got home, pulled some clothes out of the washing basket \u2013 I really couldn\u2019t be bothered.\u201d She met him at a bar five minutes\u2019 walk from her house in northern England and found herself chatting away. \u201cHe sat there, nodding and smiling, and I thought: \u2018He\u2019s got a really nice smile.\u2019\u201d Preeta had an active social life, many friends and had had crushes and \u201cmany drunken nights out\u201d at university. But when she met Owen she had neither had a boyfriend, nor told anyone she was a virgin. She ascribes her lack of sexual experience to self-consciousness about her appearance and her traditional Indian upbringing. Preeta\u2019s parents had had an arranged marriage, and their disapproval of premarital sex was hard to shake, even though she did not agree with them. The combination of factors led to her being what she describes as \u201ca bit particular\u201d; she was without confidence, but not self-respect, and wanted her first time to be with someone special. \u201cMy biggest fear was marrying someone to please my parents, then later on meeting somebody I really loved.\u201d Owen\u2019s experience was different. He was bullied at school, struggled to make friends and considered himself \u201ckind of an outsider\u201d. In his 20s he focused on his career in IT and moved for work. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I was 28 or 29 that it really occurred to me that I should have had a girlfriend by now.\u201d When he signed up to the dating agency, he had already thought about going to see a sex worker. \u201cI never really got anywhere, for want of a better term, before I met Preeta,\u201d he says. Preeta was his first kiss, on their fifth date. They discovered they were both virgins the same night. A little while later, \u201cwe tried and it didn\u2019t happen, then one time it did, and that was that,\u201d says Preeta. \u201cIt was nice, actually, discovering that he had no experience either, because it just meant we could learn together. It came together very naturally.\u201d Now that they are married, the fact that they have not had previous partners is \u201cneither here nor there\u201d, she says. The affection, intimacy and support of their marriage is still more important to her than sex. Luck, they say, was a factor in their meeting, but it also took work to join the dating agency, to make time to see each other, to get to know each other, to overcome the fear of intimacy and even of falling in love. In fact, Preeta admits ruefully, she had been thinking of not seeing Owen again after their second date. \u201cIt was so stupid, looking back \u2013 it was a ridiculous reason \u2013 but Owen was sober at the time and on our second date he ordered a milkshake. I was like: \u2018Who does that?\u2019 I just thought it was really weird.\u201d Owen believes dating is generally harder for men, because of the lingering expectation that they will make the first move. But he approached dating as a hobby, thinking: \u201cI\u2019d just give it a try.\u201d With age, physical attractiveness is less important than being a well-rounded person, he says. \u201cIt is hard. But you\u2019ve got to make things happen a little bit.\u201d He has been in therapy on and off since he was 17, \u201cand I\u2019ve learned that a lot of our beliefs are patterns or habits, and you have to break out. You\u2019re not on your own, everyone has problems \u2013 I\u2019m just not in the same place as I was when I was younger.\u201d Many later-in-life virgins describe their first experience of sex as anticlimactic. \u201cEveryone goes on about sex being the best thing ever \u2013 for me, it was like: \u2018Meh,\u2019\u201d says Alex, from south-west Dorset. He was 36 at the time. \u201cIt was like, is that it? There was nothing amazing about it.\u201d But then he had never really been interested in sex, even as a teenager. Now 44, Alex has not had sex in more than four years, and, although he would like a relationship, he accepts that it may not happen. The light of his life is his three-year-old daughter. Though he and her mother are no longer a couple, they have a good relationship. Alex takes care of their little girl every weekend. \u201cEvery Friday, I knock on the door, and before I\u2019ve even finished knocking, she goes: \u2018DADDY.\u2019 When I was younger, I said I\u2019d never get married, I\u2019d never have kids. But my daughter\u2019s the best thing to have happened in my life.\u201d Rhea, 33, lost her virginity six months ago, on her second date with a man she met through an app. Although it was no great love story \u2013 he ghosted her afterwards \u2013 she describes it as enjoyable: \u201cIt was clumsy, nothing like the movies, but fun nonetheless.\u201d Losing her virginity changed little, she says, beyond relieving her of the pressure to pretend. \u201cI do feel like I can get on with life and that one thing is off my list \u2013 and I did it on my terms.\u201d For others, the act itself can be the least of their challenges. Sarah lost her virginity when she was 31, about six months into her marriage. She and her husband were devout Mormons, and she describes the church as considering extramarital sex as a sin secondary only to murder. After decades of sexual repression, Sarah found the transition to having sex post-wedding hard: \u201cMy mind was still quite closed on it.\u201d She was diagnosed with vaginismus \u2013 which the NHS describes as the body\u2019s automatic reaction to the fear of vaginal penetration. Their marriage lasted 10 years; Sarah eventually left her husband, whom she came to see as a bully. She subsequently left the church, too \u2013 which she had been a member of since she was nine years old. Many of her former Mormon friends still have hangups about sex, she says, and she was determined not to rank among them. In her 40s, she says: \u201cI decided I wasn\u2019t going to live with sexually repressed thinking. I worked hard, I read articles and books, I completely rethought my view on sexuality.\u201d She had a one-night stand, a same-sex experience and read books with titles such as The Good Girl\u2019s Guide to Bad Girls\u2019 Sex and Sex Tips for Straight Women from a Gay Man (both of which she recommends). It was \u201cexciting and terrifying and confusing and enlightening\u201d, she says. \u201cYou hear people say: \u2018I wish I\u2019d known what I know now when I was a teenager\u2019 \u2013 I kind of did it like that, the wrong way round. I had my teenage years in my 40s.\u201d Sarah is now 56 and describes sex as \u201cjust delightful\u201d. There don\u2019t seem to have been \u201cany lasting effects\u201d from her slower-than-average start in sex. \u201cMy understanding of the world and myself is that sex is a very natural, normal part of life. I think I\u2019m kind of regular, boring, normal \u2013 not that I actually believe there is a normal.\u201d Sarah\u2019s advice to a struggling older virgin is not to jump on dating apps, but to work on their self-confidence and \u201cunderstand their relationship with themselves\u201d. Preeta, meanwhile, can even see some advantages to her late start: she and Owen knew what they were looking for. \u201cBecause we were in our 30s, to a certain extent you\u2019ve gone through figuring out who you are in the world.\u201d She mentions a friend who has had one boyfriend or another since was she was 17. \u201cI was quite self-assured in a lot of respects \u2013 that also helped me to go: \u2018This is what I want and this is what I don\u2019t want out of life.\u2019 I wanted it to be on my terms, and it was.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a cliche to say it will happen when you least expect it; I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to say that. But I think it will happen when you\u2019re ready for it to happen.\u201d All names have been changed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
