So it was good to find pianist Malcolm Martineau redressing the balance, devoting the entire first half of this programme with soprano Lisa Milne and tenor John Mark Ainsley to the composer's songs. You can, however, have too much of a good thing, and there were moments in that first half where one longed for a more decisive change of pace and atmosphere. Martineau was as dextrous and reliable a pianist as ever, but, beginning the evening with the Cinq Po\u00e8mes de Paul Eluard, his playing verged on the loud side for Ainsley, who seemed, unusually, slightly constricted. For Ainsley's best Poulenc we had to wait for his beautifully sustained encore. Milne's soft-edged but glowing soprano generally came over better, especially in C'est Ainsi Que Tu Es, sung with the sensuous ease of a chanteuse manqu\u00e9e, in the slow, discordant waltz of Violon and the dreamy Fleurs. The second half began with a brand new homage, Friendly Persuasions, by the US composer Jake Heggie - four songs each describing one of Poulenc's friends, to bland words by Gene Scheer that could have been from Poulenc! the Musical. Ainsley did his considerable best for them. They paled beside Trois M\u00e9lodies by the young Messiaen, and the otherworldliness of the prayer in the last of them, raptly sung by Milne, gave a strong hint of the composer he would become. Honegger's succinct cycle Saluste du Bartas had Ainsley as a debonair narrator of these vignettes of courtly love. Best, though, were the drily witty songs from Manuel Rosenthal's Chansons de Monsieur Bleu, to words straight from the nursery: Ainsley's expansive exposition on grammar, and Milne's grave story of the elephant who went pipi in his pants."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
