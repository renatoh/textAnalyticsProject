Though there have been rumors of trouble between the two, this represents an about-face for a supremely loyal artist who has been on the label since he was 11, staying while other signees departed. It\u2019s a shame, because the two made great music together, and the decade-old Carter series has defined Wayne\u2019s career. Though 2011\u2019s Carter IV was a stinker, there\u2019s reason to be optimistic this time around, including some decent early singles and a reunion with Cash Money beatmaker Mannie Fresh. So, to tide us over until V actually arrives, here\u2019s the takeaway on the four previous Carters, ranked and rated. Tha Carter IV (2011) On Tha Carter IV Lil Wayne went off the rails. Having conquered the music industry with Tha Carter III, Wayne seemingly felt he had little to prove. What else could explain lines as lazy and humorless as \u201cI woke up this morning, dick rock hard/ Ashed my blunt in my Grammy award\u201d? Well, there was another theory; following his release from Rikers Island (where he served eight months on a weapons conviction) he was required to give up his beloved sizzurp, which stunted his creativity. He was still rhyming about the same things he always was \u2013 money, women, his toughness \u2013 but without the cleverness, without the sharpness. It\u2019s not that there are no good songs on the album, but he\u2019s not even on one of the best, \u201cInterlude,\u201d featuring Tech N9ne and Andre 3000. And it remains perplexing how Wayne could believe the word \u201clasagna\u201d contains a silent \u2018g.\u2019 Perhaps the best thing to be said about IV is that it wasn\u2019t as bad as his 2010 \u201crock\u201d album, Rebirth. Rating: D Best three tracks: 6 Foot 7 Foot, Interlude, How to Love Tha Carter III (2008) Tha Carter III was anticipated by a slew of Weezy mixtapes, which he seemed to record in single takes, in between gulps of promethazine cough syrup and Hawaiian punch. By this point he\u2019d clearly grown into himself, lagging playfully behind the beat, utilizing his fully-developed croak, and riffing his brains out. When it came time for the official album, pundits assumed he\u2019d already put all his best work out, and even if he hadn\u2019t, why would folks buy the cow when they could have the milk for free? Well, turns out V was one hell of a cow. Going triple platinum, it was a brisk seller in an era where rampant illegal downloading had many convinced that music sales were extinct. Lollipop was his first number one single, while A Milli re-established him as a lyrical (and breath control) beast. Meanwhile, deep cuts like You Ain\u2019t Got Nuthin showed Wayne could still excel down in the gutter, matching Juelz Santana and Fabolous in a showdown of grimy lyricism. Grade: A- Best three tracks: A Milli, Got Money, You Ain\u2019t Got Nuthin Tha Carter II (2005) Tha Carter II is something of a bridge album, transitioning Wayne from former Hot Boy status to dominant game-changer. Despite Tha Carter\u2019s success, he brought to the sequel a chip on his shoulder, anxious to show not just that southern rappers could be lyrical, but that he was the best emcee going, regardless of geography. To so do he rapped over a series of tracks with no hooks; Fly In which showcases his increasingly distinctive, arresting vocal chops \u2013 is the best of these. But perhaps most notable was the development of his songwriting skills, and his growing mastery of song structure. He was learning how to write a hit, how to appeal to the suburbs. The result was an album that sold two million and is ranked, by many Wayne fans, as his best work to date. Grade: A Best three tracks: Fly In, Lock and Load, Hustler Musik Tha Carter (2004) Remember when the Cash Money crew were simply Millionaires, back before they became Billionaires? (I\u2019d like an audit of Euro\u2019s holdings, by the way.) For many, the time when the Williams brothers, Juvenile, Wayne, BG, and the crew brewed up one hit after another remains the gold standard for the label. Their producer Mannie Fresh parted company with the imprint not long after Tha Carter, but not before leaving a series of classic beats on that album, including This Is the Carter, Ain\u2019t That a Bitch, and Go DJ, a reimagined New Orleans club song from Wayne\u2019s youth. On Tha Carter Wayne is cocky, but still vulnerable, most clearly on the Hot Boys lament I Miss My Dawgs. At the end of the day, Tha Carter feels like a classic Cash Money record, full of the bounce and whimsy that sometimes gets lost in the Young Money shuffle. Grade: A+ Best three tracks: I Miss My Dawgs, Ain\u2019t That a Bitch, This Is The Carter"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
