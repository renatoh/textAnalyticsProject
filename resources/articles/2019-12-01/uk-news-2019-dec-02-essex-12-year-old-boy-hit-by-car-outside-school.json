Four teenagers and a woman in her 50s were also hurt during the incident in Loughton, in Essex, though their injuries were not thought to be life-threatening. \u201cAs a school and a community, we are devastated to say that as a result of the incident in Willingale Road this afternoon, it is with great sadness that we must report that a 12-year-old student from our school has sadly died,\u201d said Helen Gascoyne, the headteacher of Debden Park high school. \u201cOur thoughts are with the family and all those affected. As a school we continue to work with the police supporting the ongoing investigation.\u201d The boy, named on Tuesday as Harley Watson, died in hospital, while Essex police said those injured included two 15-year-old boys, a 13-year-old boy, a 16-year-old girl and a 53-year-old woman. At least three of the teenagers were thought to be pupils at the school. On Monday night, Essex police said: \u201cA man has been arrested following a fatal collision in Loughton. \u201cThe 51-year-old, from Loughton, was arrested on suspicion of murder, six offences of attempted murder, one offence of causing death by dangerous driving, six offences of causing serious injury by driving, failing to stop at the scene of a collision and driving without insurance. \u201cThere is no wider threat to the public at this time, but we continue to ask anyone with information to come forward and assist with our inquiries.\u201d The arrest came after police earlier said they were searching for Loughton man Terry Glover over the incident. Officers had earlier urged people not to speculate about the circumstances surrounding the collision. Essex and Herts air ambulance said it was called out to help the East of England ambulance service and Essex police. Officers had been called to the scene just after 3.20pm on Monday. In a statement released later that evening, Det Ch Insp Rob Kirby said: \u201cThis has been a truly shocking incident and my deepest sympathies are with all those involved. \u201cI would like to thank the many members of the public who have called us with information and spoken to our officers, as well as those who provided crucial medical assistance at the scene. \u201cI would urge anyone with information, dashcam footage, or who may have seen anything on social media that they think could be crucial, to call us on 101 and quote incident number 726 of 2 December.\u201d Debden Park is a mixed academy school for pupils aged 11 to 18, which specialises in the performing arts and received a rating of \u201coutstanding\u201d in its most recent Ofsted inspection, according to its prospectus."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
