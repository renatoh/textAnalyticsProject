Barely a year since taxpayers funded a multibillion-pound bailout of the industry, investment banks have bounced into profit and are paying out big bonuses. As executives at Goldman Sachs, the highest profile City player, begin to tell staff of their annual bonus payments tomorrow , Myners calls for a rethink. He warns the industry it cannot continue to rely on taxpayers' \"charity\". \"Investment banking has spread into everything we do in business. Company executives spend more and more time with investment bankers,\" he writes in the Guardian. \"We need to re-examine an economic model that seems to work much better for investment banks than for businesses and workers.\" He also criticises takeover rules that make it easy for companies to be bought by overseas operators: Cadbury's bitterly contested takeover by the US conglomerate Kraft was announced last week to protests from unions fearing job cuts. Insisting that he wants a vibrant City to contribute to GDP, Myners says his intention is to promote discussion and debate. \"I think this is a suitable subject for a major independent review after the election into how investment banking has permeated so many corners of society,\" he said . He has already called for a review of the fees that investment banks charge for helping companies raise money from shareholders and bond markets, but is now toughening his tone. While there was public anger about the bailouts, Myners said it was \"the fundamental unfairness of the rescue that should be the cause of lasting anger\". \"When recessions hit, many businesses get into trouble. And some businesses fail, taking many jobs with them. Banks, however, were for the most part protected from the rules that applied to everyone else \u2013 and protected at great cost to public funds,\" he said. \"Any institution that thinks it will always be bailed out when the going gets tough is an inherently dangerous institution. If you never have to face the consequences of bad decisions, you are less likely to be as careful as you should be when making important choices.\" The big Wall Street banks, which employ thousands in the City, have reported their 2009 figures in recent days. Goldman Sachs is being described as the most profitable firm in Wall Street's history after reporting results last week that showed the banking crisis was a distant memory. But its key London directors, such as Michael Sherwood, will be told formally tomorrow that their bonuses are being capped at \u00a31m because of Alistair Darling's one-off tax on bonuses of more than \u00a325,000. Goldman partners in other parts of the world are not subject to such bonus restrictions and, along with the bank's 32,000 employees, will be paid out of a $16.2bn (\u00a310.1bn) salary and bonus pot. In an effort to win international support for a crackdown on the banking sector, Myners is hosting a G7 summit tomorrowto consider a possible levy on financial transactions that has been promoted by the prime minister. The Downing Street meeting will aim to find a way to \"shift the burden of financial sector support from the public to the private sector\". \"There are several options \u2013 among them a global insurance levy, the use of innovative contingent capital instruments already developed in the UK, and a global transactions tax,\" Myners said. After the historic intervention in the banking sector by Barack Obama last week to stop banks which take consumer deposits from engaging in risky trading activities, ministers are coming under pressure from opposition parties to follow his lead. Myners indicated the government was likely to promote its own idea for \"living wills\" which banks must create to allow them to be broken up without the need for taxpayer support in the event that they collapse. \"I don't see anything in the Obama proposals which makes us want to change our line of travel, which is having more capital and living wills,\" Myners said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
