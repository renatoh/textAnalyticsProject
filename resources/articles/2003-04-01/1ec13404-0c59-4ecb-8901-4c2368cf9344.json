They would have locked him up by now. Animated is not a word that has ever sprung to mind when searching to describe his temperament. But yesterday afternoon it was if he had taken a crash course at Rada in how to display public emotion. Urbane? Controlled? Bland? Not this Brooking. When the fourth official signalled an extra six minutes, he looked in exaggerated horror at his watch and as the tension mounted he strayed out of the technical area. The fourth official clearly didn't have the heart to move him. And neither did Kevin Keegan. Later all was control and finesse, not a hair out of place, although when he entered the press room for the post-match conference, he hesitated for just a few seconds at the door. Not because he had anything to fear, quite the reverse, simply that these days he is more used to asking questions or just listening. And so the match was relived, only this time there were no theatrics, no clasping of his head, or punching of the air as happened when Freddy Kanout\u00e9 scored - although at the time Brooking didn't have the foggiest idea who had put the ball in the net. \"When you're in the dug-out you haven't a clue who scored.\" Or about much else, he admitted. He knew what was going on all right - when a player was in the open, or when a player was being closed down on the blind side - but Brooking learned the lesson that all managers know, and ignore, that there is virtually no chance of being influential from the sidelines. All you can do is shout and Brooking's croaky voice bore testimony to that. But it was his presence that really mattered. For this is the man who scored an FA Cup-winning goal with his head, which rarely came into contact with the ball during his career. Anyone who can achieve that is someone to have on your side when the chips are down. Of course it will be Paul Goddard and Roger Cross, following Glenn Roeder's road map, who will remain the major influence on the training field. Brooking, who has talked much of continuity, will act as the talisman, the more so after this victory. It could so easily have gone completely wrong when David James, with an habitual rush of blood, completely missed the ball as City counterattacked. Had Keegan's team scored then it might have all been over for West Ham. And then came Les Ferdinand's injury just when Brooking had taken the half-time gamble to play three up front. As Ferdinand received treatment, Brooking wandered around alone, hands on hips, taking a gentle kick at a nearby plastic bag. He missed, and thereafter everything was to go right. He may not have been able to see the angles and the finer points, but the commitment was beyond question. No fading and dying here. \"We wanted to give the club a lift. We all knew a victory would boost everyone.\" It was not Churchillian stuff, but it was deeply meant. \"And it's only for 2 weeks,\" he added, as if the first few days had already been an eternity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
