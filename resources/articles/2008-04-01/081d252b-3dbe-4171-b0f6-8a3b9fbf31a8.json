As a group of Bolton supporters gathered outside the Reebok Stadium at Saturday lunchtime to make clear their lack of faith in the club's current regime, one caught the attention more than most as he waved a placard that read: \"Mr Bush, we have found a weapon of mass destruction. Gary Mugson out.\" The gesture drew laughs and was somewhat understandable - before the visit of West Ham, Bolton had lost seven of their previous eight league matches and were four points from safety with only five games to play. But it also represented an abandonment of some perspective in this part of Lancashire. It is only seven years since the club was in the second tier of English football and they have since enjoyed top-10 finishes in four consecutive seasons and competed in Europe twice. The team has done poorly under Megson but only in comparison to a recent and unprecedented golden spell. It should also be remembered that the manager took over when Bolton were already second from bottom in the table. Speaking after the final whistle, Megson refused to comment on the rights and wrongs of the protests, which followed a midweek newspaper poll that showed the majority of the club's supporters wanted him dismissed, but he did express relief at its absence during play. Dissent, however humorous, he said, could have distracted his players. Instead, with the bulk of the 23,043 crowd behind them, Bolton excelled and deservedly recorded their first win since February 2. There were outstanding performances everywhere, particularly from Kevin Davies, who scored the 100th goal of his career but could have had another three. The 31-year-old deserved more from a performance that was a masterclass in how to operate as a lone striker, a superb demonstration of how to be both the focal point and the instigator of attacks. Davies did not give the West Ham defence a moment's peace but that was ultimately his - and could potentially be Bolton's - undoing. The forward picked up his 10th booking of the season, for a foul on John Pantsil, and is now suspended for two games. \"We're going to miss him,\" Megson said. \"There's not too many players like Kevin and when he plays like he did today, he's difficult to contain. Hopefully someone who hasn't been involved today will see how you play centre-forward and pick up the gauntlet.\" That could prove difficult. The reserve strikers are Heidar Helguson and Grzegorz Rasiak, who have scored two goals for Bolton between them this season. Davies, however, remains upbeat and believes the club can avoid relegation, beginning at Middlesbrough on Saturday followed by another away game, at Tottenham. The side directly above Bolton, Birmingham, also face testing fixtures in the same spell: a trip to Aston Villa before the visit of Liverpool. Having seen his side beaten in such an efficient manner, Alan Curbishley for one thinks Bolton have what it takes to pull off an escape. \"I've never seen a team work so hard,\" said the West Ham manager, who lost the defender Anton Ferdinand to a hamstring injury here that could keep him out for the rest of the season. \"This was vintage Bolton and we couldn't cope with it.\" But whether Wanderers avoid relegation or not, their captain, Kevin Nolan, is adamant Megson should be allowed to keep his job. \"When Sam Allardyce was here the fans also wanted him out but chopping and changing the manager is not the right thing to do. Teams go into freefall when that happens,\" Nolan said. \"We need to stabilise, hopefully the board will give its backing to Gary Megson.\" Nolan also praised the supporters for getting behind the team once the game had begun and called for a \"Reebok roar\" in the future, similar to that produced at Anfield on European nights. That seems unlikely while the fans remain unsatisfied with those in charge and even curiously lop-sided in their backing of the side - many, including the man with the placard, left their seats before the final whistle, declining the opportunity to savour a rare victory. Perhaps he was rushing home to write a more supportive message. Man of the match Kevin Davies (Bolton)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
