His first novel, Hitting the Groove, deals with the midlife crisis of a Beatles-obsessed journalist. Buy Hitting The Groove at Amazon.co.uk Jane Blanchard's favourite midlife crisis books 1. Intimacy by Hanif Kureishi The author got panned for this semi-autobiographical gem about a man who finds that being married and having children isn't as exciting as being free to sleep with other women and stay out late. A ruthlessly honest examination of what it feels like to be a horrible bastard with no thought for anyone but oneself. 2. Tropic of Cancer by Henry Miller Written in the Forties and banned practically everywhere until the 60s, this exuberant tale of a whoring, begging and starving American in Paris (an undisguised Miller himself) is an inspiration to anyone who reaches their middle years and wants to write their first novel the hard way. It can be a bit incomprehensible in parts and feminists frown upon the casual misogyny and Rabelaisian-scale pornographic content, but it was my favourite book when I was 22, which admittedly wasn't yesterday. 3. Moby Dick by Herman Melville I wouldn't actively recommend this book, owing to it being long and rather dull. But nevertheless a cautionary tale about a man's hobby getting the better of him. In recent years I have begun to see it as an allegory of husbands who go fishing and never come back. 4. Women with Men by Richard Ford Along with his rambling masterpieces The Sportswriter and Independence Day, these three stories (in particular The Womaniser - a painful study in yearning and self-delusion) depict men of a certain age looking for that missing 'something' with unwarranted optimism. No one describes with more poignancy and attention to detail the emotional mismatch between men and women than Richard Ford. The perfect wedding present. 5. Bonfire of the Vanities by Tom Wolfe I think this terrific novel suffered from being dragged through the mire by the shite film version by Brian de Palma. A zeitgeisty satire of New York society in the greedy 80s jampacked with pathetic testosteronic males trying to have it all ways. 6. Antony and Cleopatra by William Shakespeare Early midlife crisis drama featuring an ageing Antony losing himself to the narcotic pleasures of the Nile (back then, this was the equivalent of going to Ibiza) in the company of a woman who is not his wife, when he's supposed to be at home helping to rule the Roman empire. I realise Cleopatra was no spring chicken but she was, by all accounts, quite a looker. 7. The Beach by Alex Garland This is, of course, about a young idler searching for a cool paradise to lay down his bed roll, but it will equally transport anyone in their 40s and 50s back to their hippy, backpacking days, if not actually encourage them to abandon their domestic duties to do it all again. Carefree, druggy , naive, exploratory, seductive... I won't go on. 8. The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing by Melissa Bank One of my very favourite books from last year. I was particularly heartened by how the attractive young heroine shacks up with a man twice her age, even though he is not noticeably wealthy. Tip for male readers: display your sensitive side by openly reading it on the train. 9. The Iceman Cometh by Eugene O'Neill Hugely powerful postwar American-Irish drama, and a warning to all men who spend their waking hours in the pub. Hickey, a hardware salesman, is eventually reduced to shooting his wife, not because she nags him too much about coming home hammered after three days on a bender, but because he can't bear to see her so disappointed in him. Don't try this at home. 10. American Beauty, screenplay by Alan Ball I loved this film so much that I had to go out and buy the screenplay (or at least have it sent to me from the publishers for nothing, which is almost the same thing). An exquisitely constructed account of a man self-destructing in the pursuit of life, liberty and his teenage daughter's best friend. You know it will end in tears - and, come to think of it, blood."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
