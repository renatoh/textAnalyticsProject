Or then again, not) to write about how Gordon's embarrassing Obamaha-ha faux-pas was the least of his worries, and provide a Top 10 list of handy hints to ensure the future wellbeing and happiness of the parliamentary Labour Party. Until last Saturday night, when, after a day spent promenading among Random-on-Sea's charming beachfront watering holes, accessorised by a selection of friends of unvarying glamour, wit and sophistication (OK, traversing Random's spooky seafront \"underpass\", sidestepping the career drunks who, judging by their head wounds, had hit their glass ceilings), it was time to kick back and enjoy a frisky bottle of ros\u00e9 and Sky Movies. Because my idea of downtime rarely involves sitting in front of a screen, when I go to the cinema it's usually with a child or two in tow: thus, Madagascar 2, Night at the Museum 2, Bolt, Monsters vs Aliens... been there, done them. On the other hand, Slumdog Millionaire, The Reader, Milk, Benjamin Button, The Dark Knight... none of these have I seen, and it's guaranteed I'll catch Coraline long before I see Kate as a Nazi. So I scrolled down the movies and rejected most on the grounds that, basically, I'd never heard of them, until I spotted Quantum of Solace, which had \"Saturday night\" written all over it, and because I'd enjoyed Casino Royale and Daniel Craig in his smalls. For \u00a33.97 I couldn't go wrong, could I? Could I hell. Obviously this would be a more damning observation if I'd recently watched a few films that didn't star animals, but Quantum of Solace is easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen, even if Google revealed that, bafflingly, the critics quite liked it. The first 45 minutes are unwatchable due to the crack-addict editing so entirely, dementedly, soul-destroyingly fast that it is invariably impossible to work out who is chasing whom at any given nanosecond, much less care why they are doing it. Infuriated, yet intrigued by the level of my fury, I forced myself to keep watching; and perhaps this marks me out as \"old\", but I fail to see why Bond - a character who, for all his anachronistic faults, is a character - has now been re-branded as an expressionless action-automaton overcoming increasingly implausible arcade game-style stunts. Daniel Craig looked great, but lost - a fine actor with nothing to say, far too much to do and not enough time in which to do it. Indeed, for most of the film he wore an expression comparable to the \"working-mother grimace\": we're busy juggling school runs, deadlines and a dental appointment; Bond is plate-spinning two baddies, a martini and couple of hot double agents. Indeed, aside from the body count, the only difference between Bond and your average working mom is that 007 doesn't ever \"chillax\" in front of a Bond movie on a Saturday night, for which he should be grateful. Hell, I'd rather blow up a Bolivian hotel, too. Obviously many more modern blockbusters should be directed by jugglers. Or, at the very least, women. We are not, as a gender, remotely averse to action movies, but I make no apologies for the fact that we do like the action to be occasionally leavened with a side order of communication. Yes, in among the sounds of the fury (B'Doooooooof!) a bit of snogging, some chatting, a few frocks and, er, stuff is just the ticket for those picky viewers who prefer to relax on the sofa. OK, so it doesn't have to be Sex and the City, but (at the risk of sounding like a belated review for an old movie - a risk I'll risk, frankly) Bond's future wellbeing and happiness calls for a (necessarily) violent solution: hang the director, quarter the editor, guillotine the writers, hand the franchise over to girls and see if they can't come up with a movie that viewers with a majority of X chromosomes and attention spans longer than goldfish may conceivably enjoy. Obviously I'm thinking Dr No meets Spirited Away... so I'm sorry, Dan, but an animated Bond would mean you could return to acting, which you're really good at - but do pop us a cheque for \u00a33.97 in the post before you go. kathryn.flett@observer.co.uk \u2022 The article was changed on Wednesday 7 October 2009 because we had contravened our style guide by using the words \"on the autistic spectrum\" to describe fans of action films, [implying they had no communication skills or long attention spans]."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
