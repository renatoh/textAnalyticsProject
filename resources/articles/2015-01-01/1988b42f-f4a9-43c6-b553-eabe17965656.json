I\u2019ve been in this situation before and it can affect people. If you don\u2019t do something about it, in a short space of time, you can end up drifting. So a decision has to be made \u2013 for everybody\u2019s benefit.\u201d Carver, who takes his team to Chelsea on Saturday, wants the job himself and would be delighted to remain in charge until the end of the season in order to prove his credentials. With Lee Charnley, the club\u2019s managing director, understood to have opened talks with R\u00e9mi Garde regarding the former Lyon coach and Arsenal midfielder taking over at St James\u2019 Park that may not happen. With other names on the shortlist including Saint-\u00c9tienne\u2019s Christophe Galtier, the former Mainz coach Thomas Tuchel, Ajax\u2019s Frank de Boer and Derby\u2019s Steve McClaren not available until the summer, if at all, difficult decisions must be taken. On Friday bookmakers added to the confusion by slashing the odds on Tim Sherwood \u2013 a name not believed to have been on the list \u2013 taking over. \u201cIt\u2019s a circus,\u201d Carver said. Part of the problem is Newcastle were caught cold by Pardew\u2019s defection to Crystal Palace and had no replacement waiting in the wings. Although the interest in McClaren was genuine, the delay in making a move resulted in the Derby manager deciding his loyalties lay with the Championship club. If the chances of Charnley changing McClaren\u2019s mind in the summer appear remote, others may be much more receptive come June. Carver appreciates the problems but is adamant Mike Ashley, Newcastle\u2019s owner cannot let the hiatus continue for much longer. \u201cWhen I had that conversation with Lee where I said: \u2018I want to throw my hat in the ring\u2019, I told him: \u2018You want the right coach but you can\u2019t allow this to go on and on and on,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThey understand that. What they\u2019re not going to do, and rightly so, is make a rash decision and say \u2018we\u2019ll take him.\u2019 They need time to think and I understand that. Lee trusts me to do the job while they can have their thinking time and do their due diligence. I understand that but a decision needs to be made sooner rather than later.\u201d Carver is confident he could be the right man. \u201cWhy not,\u201d said the former Toronto manager. \u201cI\u2019ve got the pro licence. I\u2019ve worked with some of the best people in the game \u2013 Kevin Keegan, Kenny Dalglish, Ruud Gullit, Sir Bobby Robson \u2013 top people with different styles of management.\u201d After his first two games in charge ended in a home draw with Burnley and an FA Cup defeat at Leicester, Carver knows he could do with a victory in the remaining pair of fixtures Charnley has booked him in for. \u201cNot many teams go to Chelsea and win,\u201d Carver said, \u201cbut I definitely might have to beat Southampton at home.\u201d Whoever ends up at the helm saw their chances of working with Moussa Sissoko enhanced on Friday when Laurent Blanc, the Paris St-Germain coach, said he was not interested in signing Newcastle\u2019s best midfielder. \u201cMoussa Sissoko does not fit the profile we are looking for,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we must not forget we are still subject to the rules of financial fair play.\u201d Shortly after Blanc spoke to the French media, Sissoko issued a tweet. \u201cI\u2019m a professional player and I stay focused on my team, NUFC,\u201d he wrote. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to rumours.\u201d PSG had been strongly linked with an attempt to recruit Sissoko this month but now Arsenal appear his only remaining serious suitors. Whether they would meet Newcastle\u2019s \u00a325m asking price remains a moot point."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
