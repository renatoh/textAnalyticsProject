The Legal Services Consumer Panel believes there should be a culture shift in the legal market to improve access to justice following the government's withdrawal of legal aid for many areas of civil litigation. The report was compiled as more McKenzie friends \u2013 unregulated and usually legally unqualified \u2013 begin to charge for their advice and representation of individuals in court. The term is derived from a famous divorce case, McKenzie v McKenzie in 1970, where the husband could not afford to hire a lawyer but was eventually allowed to receive courtroom assistance from an adviser. The consumer panel's report says: \"There are reports of a rise in fee-charging McKenzie friends aiming to meet the needs of litigants who are no longer eligible for legal aid funding but cannot afford legal representation.\" A survey found the majority of Mckenzie friends are sole traders, having gained courtroom experience through involvement in their own divorce or child contact case. Few have legal qualifications although increasingly they are granted rights of audience and allowed to speak on behalf of a client in court. Their typical hourly rate is \u00a335-60 and daily rate \u00a3150-200. Most specialise in family law though others work in employment tribunals or on consumer disputes and housing issues. Some are reported to be earning as much as \u00a3100,000 a year. The report says: \"Litigation through the courts on a family matter can be expensive and beyond the means of a great many individuals. Added to this is the withdrawal of legal aid funding, while 'matrimonial disputes' tend to be excluded from most legal expenses insurance policies. Therefore, for those who cannot afford legal representation, the real choice is between using a McKenzie friend or being entirely unsupported during proceedings.\" The panel recommends that: \"Fee-charging McKenzie friends should be recognised as a legitimate feature of the evolving legal services market [but that] \u2026 automatic rights of audience should not be granted to McKenzie friends.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
