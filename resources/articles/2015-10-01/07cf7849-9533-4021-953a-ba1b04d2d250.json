Crystal Palace were left flying the flag for London but they encountered a northern powerhouse, in the shape of Manchester City, and were duly dispatched from the competition. Alan Pardew had overseen City\u2019s elimination last season, when his Newcastle side won at the Etihad, but the sequel had an altogether sorrier ending for the 54-year-old, who suffered his heaviest defeat as Palace manager. Wilfried Bony, Kevin De Bruyne, Kelechi Iheanacho, Yaya Tour\u00e9 and Manu Garc\u00eda secured a fifth win in six games for the 2014 winners, who host Hull in the quarter-finals and must be the favourites to regain this trophy. If this was another exhibition of attacking potency, a sense of freshness was the most encouraging element. City are accustomed to seeing expensive signings strike but the presence of two products of their youth system on the scoresheet was welcome indeed for a club with aspirations to develop their own players. Their fifth goal was made in the academy, with the 17-year-old Garc\u00eda sweeping in the 19-year-old Iheanacho\u2019s pass. The Spaniard made his home debut, the Nigerian his full debut. Each was an auspicious occasion. Iheanacho, who was named the outstanding player in the 2013 Under-17 World Cup, had struck a minute into his senior career against Palace last month, prompting calls from supporters for him to be unleashed sooner. It was a populist gesture by Manuel Pellegrini to grant him a maiden start. \u201cI had no doubts,\u201d said a manager who is not renowned for trusting teenagers. The forward scored one goal, made two more and performed with the verve and assurance to suggest he belongs on this stage. \u201cHe is not just a striker and not just a finisher,\u201d said Pellegrini. \u201cHe always played with his head up so he made two important assists.\u201d Indeed, Iheanacho illustrated his passing range, along with the maturity to make the right decision. City\u2019s second goal, just before half-time, was a case in point. He skipped clear and while everyone else converged at the near post, calibrated his cross perfectly to allow De Bruyne, arriving unseen at the far post, a tap-in. The favour was returned for the third goal. De Bruyne provided a low centre and Bony dummied to give Iheanacho the chance to deliver a composed finish. That was a highlight of Bony\u2019s night; so, too, was the header to open the scoring, when he stooped to meet Aleksandar Kolarov\u2019s corner as Adrian Mariappa lost the Ivorian. \u201cEvery time they had a great chance, they punished us,\u201d said Pardew. That was not strictly true. De Bruyne could have had a hat-trick, with Wayne Hennessey making one outstanding save; Bony perhaps should have had one as well. His performance was akin to a curate\u2019s egg. He scored, almost supplied another and, without touching the ball, contributed to City\u2019s third goal. He also scuffed a shot at Hennessey and skewed another embarrassingly high over the bar after the purposeful Fernando had fashioned the most inviting of chances with a surging run. Bony\u2019s patchy display mirrored a stop-start City career, which has now spanned nine months and brought only five goals. With Sergio Ag\u00fcero hamstrung this sequence of four successive starts is his first chance of an extended run in the side, but there is a case for Iheanacho to leapfrog him in the pecking order. \u201cKun is impossible to replace,\u201d said Pellegrini. \u201cBut Bony knows he has the trust of me and the team.\u201d A second Ivorian joined him among the goals when Damien Delaney wrestled Eliaquim Mangala to the ground and Tour\u00e9 scored from the resulting penalty. Garc\u00eda\u2019s stoppage-time goal took City\u2019s tally to 16 goals in three domestic games at the Etihad, rendering Sunday\u2019s stalemate in the Manchester derby still more of an anomaly. \u201cThis is the way we normally play,\u201d said Pellegrini. \u201cMaybe it was an accident on Sunday that we couldn\u2019t create chances.\u201d Both sides fashioned plenty. Palace were afforded hope by the wretched Willy Caballero. Pellegrini\u2019s preference is to pick Joe Hart\u2019s deputy, an ally from their time together at M\u00e1laga, in the cups, but his inability to cope with the crossed ball renders him a liability. The victory was achieved despite, not because, of his presence in goal. Palace\u2019s two clearest openings were created by Caballero, first spilling Jordon Mutch\u2019s cross at the feet of Joe Ledley, who blazed over, and then coming for, and missing, Mutch\u2019s free-kick. Mile Jedinak\u2019s header would have crossed the line but for Mart\u00edn Demichelis, sweeping up behind the errant goalkeeper. Caballero contrived to cost himself a clean sheet by allowing Delaney\u2019s late header to escape his grasp but the real blight on City\u2019s night involved another Argentinian. Pablo Zabaleta had already had his head bandaged after a collision with Yannick Bolasie \u2013 \u201cYala had over 10 stitches,\u201d said Pardew \u2013 before he thudded into a challenge with Wilfried Zaha and was carried off on a stretcher. \u201cPablo had the same injury he had two months ago,\u201d said Pellegrini. \u201cThe same ligament, the same knee.\u201d The right-back will have a scan onThursday, and a period on the sidelines seems inevitable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
