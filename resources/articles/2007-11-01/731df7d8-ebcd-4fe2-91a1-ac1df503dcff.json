Everyone recognises this fact, not least ministers. The reason they are having to stress the need for cooperation is because it has not hitherto been a notable feature in relations between the further and compulsory education sectors. That is recognised too. So why, some college leaders are asking, is the government pursuing a policy that they say is guaranteed to drive the two sectors apart. The policy in question makes it easier for schools to open new sixth forms. Labour's education plan, the Five Year Strategy for Children and Learners, unveiled in July 2004, made it clear that henceforth successful schools for 11- to 16-year-olds that wanted to acquire sixth forms would get the go ahead. By any measures, Huish Episcopi school in Langport, Somerset, fits this bill. It was designated an \"outstanding\" school in its most recent Ofsted inspection in March this year. And it wants a sixth form. Or rather, according to its head, Graham Roff, it wants something with a more contemporary ring, catering for more than just those pursuing A-levels, and it hopes to have it up and running next September. \"We're trying to record it as 16 to 19 provision rather than a sixth form,\" he says. \"Sixth form, for some people, gives a more defined picture of a range of subjects and an approach than we want to give.\" Colleges are not happy However the school phrases its ambition, it is not going down well with three local colleges. The leaders of Bridgwater College, Strode College, Street, and Richard Huish College, Taunton, are opposed to the school's plans. Their case is that they are excellent institutions, all officially designated as \"beacon\" colleges, that can offer 16-year-olds a much broader and richer range and combination of courses than any school sixth form can, and that if new sixth forms are permitted that richness is put under threat. To spread finite funding for capital building projects more thinly benefits no one, they say. And, inevitably, colleges and schools are driven to compete for students, rather than work together. This situation is more starkly illustrated here than elsewhere in the country, the principals say, because two of the colleges - Bridgwater and Strode - are tertiary institutions. In much of the area they serve, they have become, due to earlier education policy in their region, the sole public-sector providers of post-16 education. And Richard Huish is a sixth-form college with 1,800 16- to 18-year-old students. \"We offer about 50 subjects at A-level, including applied A-levels,\" says Tim Duffin, vice-principal of Richard Huish. \"And we can offer combinations to suit any students. \"We've got students doing, say, philosophy, French, maths and chemistry. That would almost certainly not be possible if we had only 13 A-level subjects on offer.\" And a sixth form with fewer than 300 students could not offer more than 13 A-levels, he says. Huish Episcopi is aiming for a sixth form with 235 places. Roff says he is responding to parental demand. \"In a recent survey of parents in our own school and of some in the older years in our feeder primary schools, 98% said that they wanted a choice on whether their child attended college or school.\" There is also a geographical argument, says Roff. \"We are in a rural county. These colleges are 14 or more miles away. Some students are waiting for buses at 7.30am and getting home from 6pm onwards, which wears them down, day-after-day.\" He says he looks forward to cooperating with colleges in running the new diplomas. \"Some of these beacon colleges would be superbly placed to deliver the specialist learning elements of the diplomas. Students could move between the institutions.\" Roff rejects the accusation that new sixth forms will put the colleges at risk and needlessly spread resources more thinly. \"The notion that our sixth form of 235 students is going to seriously impact on the colleges' ability to deliver a wide range of well-resourced courses doesn't really stand up to scrutiny,\" he says. Ian Bennett, principal of Strode College, says that any new sixth form can put the status quo at risk. \"One of the advantages of tertiary colleges is economy of scale. The rich range of provision we offer might be threatened if a new player comes in. It might diminish the opportunities available to students in other schools.\" Building grants anomaly The new building required to extend Huish Episcopi school spreads capital resources needlessly thinly, in the colleges' view. And it highlights an apparent anomaly that also does nothing for harmonious relations. The school will be able to get 100% of the money it requires for new building in grants, the principals point out, whereas colleges cannot. Strode managed to get capital grants for 40% of the \u00a32m cost of a new humanities building it is officially opening this week, says Bennett. Bridgwater, by contrast, was allowed only 10% of the \u00a39m cost of recent new building. There is simply \"no justification\" for Huish Episcopi being granted its sixth form, says Fiona McMillan, principal of Bridgwater College. \"I think there are issues about how they have asked their parents. I suspect parents who have had no experience of post-16 education will inevitably be anxious about what happens when a young person leaves school. \"It's understandable for parents to say their children might feel more comfortable in familiar surroundings, but it's not necessarily the best thing and indeed once they have made the change, what many parents realise is that it's the best thing that could have happened.\" Anxiety in parents and young people can be helped by cooperation between schools and colleges, she says. \"In Bridgwater, we start working with our partner schools from year 9 and even year 8 so that the transition won't be a shock. We work incredibly hard to settle the pupils down.\" A sixth form would offer a different ethos to that found in colleges, which some young people would prefer, says Roff. \"Our ethos is excellent and is shown in our results,\" says McMillan. \"We had excellent A-level results this year - probably the highest in the state-funded sector in Somerset.\" McMillan and her fellow principals say that once schools have sixth forms, disinterested cooperation goes out of the window. Driven by the understandable desire to keep the sixth forms going, the schools do not provide their pupils with unbiased advice - or, in some cases, any information - about college options. It is not, they say, a good basis for the new spirit of cooperation that needs to be established before the first diplomas are tried out next September."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
