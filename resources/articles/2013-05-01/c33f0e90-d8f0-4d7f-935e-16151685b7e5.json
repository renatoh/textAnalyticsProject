She always treats herself to a Marks &amp; Spencer roast chicken sandwich when she makes one of her occasional shopping trips from her home high in a Welsh valley to the city of Newport. Not today. M&amp;S moved from the city centre earlier this year to a retail park on the outskirts. \"That's a real shame,\" says Jones. \"I hadn't heard it had gone. Every city centre needs an M&amp;S. That's really depressed me. It was always one of my little treats. I'll have to go to McDonald's instead.\" Jones feels a loyalty to Newport. \"I always used to come here with my mum and I've enjoyed it. But it's not the place it used to be. You walk around now and notice all the empty shops.\" Nearly one in five shops across Wales's high streets and malls are closed, a new survey has found, and a stroll along High Street and Commercial Street in Newport confirms Jones' observations that there are an awful lot of empty stores here. Next door to where M&amp;S used to sell its chicken sandwiches is an empty shop, which was occupied by the menswear chain Burton. In the same row, the jewellers shop Paul Gentile has shut down and moved to the new town of Cwmbran, where there is a popular shopping centre with a huge free car park. Topman and Topshop have moved out and Monsoon is no longer represented here. A notice on Monsoon's former shopfront suggests would-be buyers head to the much more glitzy St David's shopping centre 15 miles down the M4 in Cardiff \u2013 or go online. More than 20 premises along High Street and Commercial Street were empty when the Guardian visited on Saturday. Many others had been taken over by charity shops, bargain stores and pawnbrokers. Just off Commercial Street, John Frost Square (named after one of the leaders of the Chartist movement) is even more empty. Work is due to start soon on demolishing the vacant shops here and building a new retail centre and cinema complex, Friars Walk. Debenhams is confirmed as the \"anchor store\", and the hope is that the likes of M&amp;S will return when this opens. But for the moment the square is almost shop-less. An upbeat city council billboard on one of the empty buildings declares: \"Newport open for business.\" Someone has scrawled \"lies\" underneath the slogan. Rob Porter, owner of independent men's clothing shop Wardrobe in the corner of the square, says it is important the building begins soon, as the development has been a painfully drawn-out process. \"We do need a boost. When shops like M&amp;S go it is a big blow to the place,\" he said. Porter thinks the problem is that many of the buildings are owned by wealthy outside speculators and investors, who do not care what happens to Newport. The company that owns the Cwmbran centre is much more pro-active, he added. \"They don't let shops stay empty. They make sure they are filled quickly.\" Almost all the shops in the lovely Market Arcade off High Street are also closed. Kev, the owner of Kev's Lucky Tattoos, is one of the few survivors. \"I sometimes wonder if we are in some sort of weird experiment to see if we can keep going no matter how hard they make it,\" he said. \"I don't think the government has any idea about how life is for people in places like this.\" Kev describes problems such as lengthy roadworks to \"unpedestrianise\" the area near his shop and believes there has been a move to turn his part of town into a zone for nightlife. \"But of course the economy is the biggest problem.\" Newport is the fourth most deprived authority in Wales. \"I think the government should cut taxes, get people spending again.\" Still, Kev remains defiant. \"I've been here 15 years and I'm not going anywhere, I'll be here forever.\" Jonathan Powell, who runs the Kiosk newsagents, also remains impressively upbeat. He had to move out of his nice old wooden kiosk when it was knocked down as part of another redevelopment and is based in a temporary metal cabin. \"It's true we've seen a drop in footfall since the closure of shops like Marks &amp; Spencer,\" he said. \"I think lots of businesses are fed up with the business rates and moving out.\" But like Kev, Powell refused to be downhearted. \"We hear this statistic that 25% of the shops in Newport are empty. I prefer to think that 75% are open. There's always two ways of looking at these things.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
