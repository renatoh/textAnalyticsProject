In a Guardian interview she recounts several examples of sexism, which left this reader with a range of emotions, from mildly irritated to: \u201cJust reading this makes me feel unclean.\u201d Women were forced to borrow helmets from male riders. On the day that Armitstead became world champion in Richmond, Virginia, her then-coach wasn\u2019t even there, as he\u2019d chosen to prioritise the men\u2019s junior team. As a 19-year-old on tour, Armitstead, now 28, was woken from her bed at 11.30pm and told to go down to the bar to celebrate the birthday of a male cyclist. As the only woman, she had \u201cno choice\u201d but to take part in a Nintendo Wii dance game, while the other male riders watched, which made her feel confused and uncomfortable. The book also deals with the issue of female prize money. When Armitstead became world champion in 2015, she won \u00a32,000, while the men\u2019s prize stood at \u00a320,000. Armitstead just professes herself pleased that the prize money is now equal. Armitstead\u2019s stories seem to echo the experiences of other female cyclists, such as Jessica Varnish, Nicole Cooke, and Victoria Pendleton. The Nintendo Wii incident comes across as particularly creepy. The impression given is of a young athlete, supposedly a peer, an equal, being subtly toyed with, slyly objectified, simply because she\u2019s female. It also leaps out rather jarringly that it\u2019s only been two years since a world cycling champion lost out on \u00a318k, again because she was female \u2013 although of course this doesn\u2019t just relate to the world of cycling. Indeed, reaching for my Humourless Feminist Calculator\u2122, I was thinking of making a cack-handed attempt to calculate the amount of money (prizes, grants, sponsorship, televised rights, etc) lost by sportswomen in, say, the past 20 to 30 years \u2013 again, simply because they were female, and thus their efforts were not as highly regarded, nor their looks deemed model-like enough to warrant stellar deals. Sadly, the calculator displayed the message \u201cYou gotta be kidding!\u201d and self-detonated \u2013 and that was even before I got to pondering: \u201cNo one\u2019s pretending that it\u2019s the Premiership, but why isn\u2019t British female football given satisfactory television coverage?\u201d In a way, Armitstead\u2019s revelations would seem to represent a microcosm of what\u2019s generally been wrong, and, in some cases, continues to be wrong, with attitudes toward women in sport. How, while there are always enough gilded examples to throw off the argument, this affects everything from female visibility to female remuneration. An entire sporting sex relegated to being perceived as \u201cbutch\u201d, \u201cunfeminine\u201d, or alternately, window dressing; female tokens, whose achievements mean less, whose treatment is shabbier, whose triumphs fail to be televised, whose complaints are shrugged off and whose pay has only recently begun to match the men\u2019s, and only then in some sports. Of course, for many women, sport per se doesn\u2019t matter, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. I\u2019m all for a modicum of gender privacy, indeed, any privacy: men doing what interests them, without women barging in, and vice versa. However, inequality always matters, and, for women who compete in or watch sport, there\u2019s an enduring perception that, in some entrenched way, men own sport, that it\u2019s still a profoundly male enclave and women could only hope to be secondary, a sideshow. This is the kind of ingrained mentality that could make it seem perfectly reasonable to ask a young sportswoman to leave her bed to go down to a bar to dance on command. It\u2019s hardly surprising that it unsettled Armitstead. For her, for all of us, the message rang out loud and clear: participating in sport isn\u2019t particularly female, but entertaining and titillating men is."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
