Ah, but there\u2019s a familiar face: Quinn! Surely he\u2019s come to rescue her \u2026 But he\u2019s pretty slow to let her go, slow enough for her to articulate one of those classic Homeland questions: \u201cWhat the fuck is going on?\u201d It\u2019s a fair question: fine, Carrie\u2019s name is \u201con a kill list\u201d and, according to Quinn\u2019s intel, it\u2019s Saul who put it in the box; but if Quinn is faking it and hasn\u2019t been planning on listening to his boss why did he have to truss her up with zip-ties while she was asleep? Anyhow, Quinn fans can relax: even if Saul has thrown her under that CIA bus, Quinn is still on Carrie\u2019s side. \u201cBelieve it \u2013 now play fucking dead,\u201d Quinn growls, plastering her face with blood and staging a \u201cproof of death\u201d photo. It\u2019s \u201cfall back time\u201d and he\u2019s going to help her disappear. Once they\u2019ve got all that clear (or as clear as anything really gets in Homeland), there\u2019s just enough time for a quick nod to what might have been between them. Must be tough when you\u2019re a spy and you have a fling with someone and then try to find them and they really don\u2019t want to be found. \u2018It\u2019s the best one on the table\u2019 And so to Saul\u2019s masterplan for peace in the Middle East. Allison and Saul team up to engineer a meeting with General Youssef, a prime candidate to replace Assad (no matter what Saul is promising the Israeli ambassador). He\u2019s in town with a sick daughter \u2013 the perfect opportunity to proposition him: $10m loaded on his jet for bribes, the promise of free elections, and the full support of the United States. \u201cI\u2019m flattered,\u201d says the General over a smoke with Saul as he takes it all on board, though even he doesn\u2019t seem that convinced it is \u201cthe best solution for Syria\u201d, and there\u2019s a real note of cynicism as Saul mentions the \u201cfull support of the United States\u201d. Douchebag Backwards Laura tracks down Sabine, another hacker who goes by the name of \u201cSavigeslut\u201d when she\u2019s online. It\u2019s a mutual appreciation society (\u201cWe know your work\u201d) and, even though Sabine is under house arrest and not allowed to talk to journalists, she\u2019s happy to put in some time on the dark web rooting around for our pal Douchebag Backwards. Not sure what the hackers in Mr Robot would make of their hacking skill here, but anyhow. Sabine alerts Douchebag Backwards to the situation: Laura\u2019s been palmed off with an empty flash drive and she\u2019s not happy. Cue a quick scene in Gratuitous But Convenient Webcamland to talk to one of the bikini-clad web-cam operators. She\u2019s dating Korzenik: where is he? As we know from last week\u2019s shady deal, Korzenik double-crossed Douchebag Backwards. His answer \u2013 \u201cRelax, we\u2019re going to be rich\u201d \u2013 doesn\u2019t exactly inspire confidence, and when he tells Douchebag Backwards: \u201cI\u2019m not stupid,\u201d you really get the feeling he\u2019s not going to be able to cut a good deal with the Russian hood who just wants to be able to \u201ctrust people\u201d. \u2018There\u2019s only one number in the memory\u2019 There\u2019s one number in Quinn\u2019s evil burner phone; Carrie calls it \u2013 and gets through to Allison Carr. Has she been double-crossing Saul after all? But before anyone has time to think any more about that, bang! Uh oh, the private jet explodes in the skies over Berlin. There goes the General, his family and Saul\u2019s great plan for peace in Syria \u2013 and $10m in cash, of course. \u201cOh my God\u201d says Saul. Quite. Notes and queries Is that an eco-friendly bulb in Quinn\u2019s bunker? He\u2019s really the most thoughtful spy in the game. \u201cYou\u2019re named after your grandfather, Frank Mathison, did you know that?\u201d Carrie\u2019s direct-to-camera message to Franny is a hard watch, but one that Claire Danes pulls off. \u201cIf you want Franny to be safe, you have to be dead.\u201d The Homeland guide to parenting for field agents is writing itself this season. \u201cSaul provides a name, I provide proof of death, return to the drop, get another name.\u201d One of the more straightforward job descriptions in the black-book world. Carrie\u2019s wig suggests that undercover wig technology has not improved much since the 1980s \u2013 did they nick it from The Americans? \u201cSending you to kill me is not smart, it\u2019s fucking stupid.\u201d She\u2019s not wrong. Presumably Carrie is back on her meds then? She seems totally fine this week. Quinn thinks of everything. General Youseff is played by Igal Naor, who had bit of a longer run as Shlomo Zahary in The Honorable Woman. Gabehcuod has got to be the best code name in Homeland history."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
