In the Premiership, fourth is nowhere. In a Grand Prix or an Olympic final, fourth place would not even squeeze you on to the podium. Here this afternoon, though, the fourth-best steeplechaser in training will suck racegoers through the doors by the thousand. Some of Ireland's best National Hunt horses, including Hardy Eustace, the champion hurdler, and Moscow Flyer, a late absentee from yesterday's main race, were on the advance billing for the track's four-day Christmas meeting. Today, though, when Best Mate, the English-trained triple Gold Cup winner, arrives to run in the Lexus Chase, he will draw the biggest attendance of the week. They adore good horses in Ireland, regardless of their nationality (and Best Mate, who was bred in Ireland and bought after running in an Irish point-to-point, is generally regarded as half-Irish anyway). Last year, the reception he received from the crowd after winning today's race was so genuine in its rapturous warmth that Henrietta Knight, Best Mate's trainer, was moved almost to tears. That, along with a belief that Leopardstown's track suits Best Mate far more than Kempton's flat circuit, ensured that he bypassed the King George VI Chase on Boxing Day to return to Dublin once more. Rarity value alone will always boost the gate when Best Mate runs, as this famously cosseted horse rarely makes more than three appearances each season. But the aura that surrounds him after three Gold Cup victories also means that many punters are desperate to see him in the flesh while they can. No-one will much care that, according to the official handicapper at least, the two-mile specialists Moscow Flyer, Azertyuiop and Well Chief are all rated superior chasers. The necessarily strict rules of handicapping, meanwhile, mean that it is difficult for any highly-rated horse to boost its mark significantly unless it runs in handicaps, something which is anathema to Knight where her stable star is concerned. Yet it is worth remembering that the most impressive performance of Best Mate's career - as far as the handicapper is concerned at least - was not achieved at Cheltenham. Rather, his high point of 175 was recorded here 12 months ago, when a flawless display of jumping carried Best Mate nine lengths clear of Le Coudray and four more ahead of Beef Or Salmon, who opposes him again today. If Best Mate is ever going to raise his performance ceiling much further, he needs to win a Grade One event from a good field by a wide margin, and today's race might just offer such an opportunity. It is not a gimme, after all, for all that he will set off as a long odds-on chance. There are horses of the quality of Pizarro and Rule Supreme, both past winners at the Cheltenham Festival, in the line-up in addition to the mercurial but richly talented Beef Or Salmon, who is already a four-time winner at Grade One level. \"I think we fear all those declared for the race,\" Jim Lewis, Best Mate's owner, said yesterday. \"If you don't, you are a fool. The ground is soft and more rain is forecast as well, which won't suit him, but you can't have it all your own way.\" Lewis's trainer, by contrast, is sometimes accused of very much wanting it all her own way where Best Mate is concerned. Even when Exeter created a special race to offer him the easiest possible start to his season last month, Knight did not finally commit Best Mate to the event until she was satisfied that the going was suitable. It is a safety-first attitude that irritates some - perhaps many - National Hunt fans, but it does at least guarantee that when Best Mate appears, it feels like a grand occasion. That will be the mood in the stands when he steps on to the track today for a race that may place Best Mate in more danger of defeat than many punters appreciate. Make no mistake, Best Mate could well be beaten today. Or he could advance further towards the all-time greats. That uncertainty is why, for an afternoon at least, fourth-best is the only show worth seeing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
