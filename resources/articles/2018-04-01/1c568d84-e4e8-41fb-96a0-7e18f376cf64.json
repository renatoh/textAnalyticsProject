Still only 23, he is Olympic, world, European and Commonwealth champion, unbeaten in almost four years. At the Commonwealth Games on Australia\u2019s Gold Coast he will aim to extend that remarkable winning run and only the foolhardy would bet against him. But Peaty\u2019s motivation is not purely more silverware \u2013 he wants cash in his bank account. The son of Mark, a supermarket caretaker, and Caroline, a nursery manager, Peaty grew up in modest surroundings in Uttoxeter in Staffordshire and cannot ignore the transformative effect his money has on their lives. \u201cI didn\u2019t come from a background of wealth like a lot of athletes, so I think it does motivate me a lot more than the normal athlete,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s great to give back to people who have supported you, friends and family alike. \u201cI am obsessed with increasing my performance year on year and there are external factors of finance, your family, your future family. Those are the things that motivate me as well.\u201d He added: \u201cI think any athlete has to think of financial security sooner or later. You don\u2019t want to get to the end of your career when you have only just thought about that. You want something to be proud of and that you have built up. I want to make the best of the situation I am in for the next few years, hopefully the next 10 years.\u201d That is not to say Peaty has grown immune to the emotion of standing atop a medal podium. He has 26 senior career medals and wants at least double that number by the time he hangs up his swimming trunks for good. \u201cI\u2019ve done that in three or four years, so anything above 50 would be pretty good. If they can all be gold, then even better. That is a massive feat to achieve but you have to have something that is really up there to push yourself every day, particularly in the winter months back home.\u201d As a single stroke swimmer, Peaty\u2019s dominance is limited to the 50m and 100m breaststroke, meaning he will never get close to the number of medals won by Michael Phelps or even Ian Thorpe, who were both multi\u2011stroke athletes. But Peaty\u2019s dominance in his own discipline is every bit as stunning. His 100m breaststroke world record at the Rio Olympics was 57.13 seconds and his winning margin in the final was more than 1.5sec. It is what prompted him to initiate \u201cProject 56\u201d with the aim being to be the first swimmer to dip under 57sec. \u201cObviously I\u2019ve seen Phelps do what he did and it\u2019s an amazing achievement,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m only breaststroke at the moment and have no plans to change, so it\u2019s very different in terms of medals. I\u2019m aiming to swim the fastest anyone\u2019s swum ever. Phelps was probably going for that as well but I\u2019m trying to push it to a point where hopefully people can\u2019t get to for many years. It would be like Bolt running 9.2/9.3sec for 100m. The rest of the world are still on 58.4 and they haven\u2019t been that fast for four years. To be almost two seconds up on the rest of the world is almost unheard of.\u201d In the more immediate future, Peaty is passionate about wearing the flag of St George and competing for England, as opposed to Great Britain. At the Team England training camp in Brisbane part of the preparation outside the pool has been to harness the feeling of what it means to be English. \u201cIt\u2019s quite easy to be Scottish or Welsh,\u201d Peaty said. \u201cBut for the English it\u2019s quite hard to get an identity. It\u2019s something we\u2019re trying to discover. As English we are not defenders, we are attackers. That\u2019s the way we\u2019re going to approach sport. We\u2019re not going to sit on a high horse, we\u2019re going to get down and dirty and race our hearts out. Just because we haven\u2019t got such a strong identity as Scotland and Wales doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re not going to give it to them in the pool and in any other sport.\u201d There is also the additional challenge of swimming outdoors, in the Gold Coast\u2019s Optus Aquatics Centre \u2013 an arena which seats 10,000 \u2013 something Peaty is relishing. \u201cI\u2019m a ginger kid from Uttoxeter, so it might be a bit difficult in heat,\u201d he joked. \u201cBut actually when you\u2019re swimming outdoors it\u2019s a lot better, you can take in the atmosphere. I came out to Brisbane two years before Rio, so I\u2019ve already got that under my belt. You\u2019ve got the sun on your back and tan as you swim. You kill two birds with one stone.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
