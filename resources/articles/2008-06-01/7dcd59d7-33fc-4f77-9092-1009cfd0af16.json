It has some incredibly honest lyrics, plus it's the first song on the album with a duration of seven minutes - that takes balls. Kim &amp; Jessie just gets you smiling in the morning. A lot of bands are plundering the 80s for inspiration at the moment, but I think M83 are the best at it. Hit the Heartbreaks has a great riff to get your blood pumping as you rush to work - this song never gets boring. A Song for Bob is the closing tune from The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. A great film and the soundtrack makes it even better. Surely no explanation is needed for Whitney Houston. 1 Knocked Up Kings Of Leon 2 Kim &amp; Jessie M83 3 Hit the Heartbreaks Black Kids 4 A Song for Bob Nick Cave and Warren Ellis 5 How Will I Know Whitney Houston"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
