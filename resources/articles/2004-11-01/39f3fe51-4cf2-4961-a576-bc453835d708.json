As part of an effort to improve relations between City investors and big business, the Investment Management Association, which represents almost 120 unit trust and fund managers controlling \u00a32 trillion of assets, suggests fund managers should inform companies if they are voting against their managements in advance of annual meetings and to tell chairmen directly about \"particularly contentious\" situations. It has posted a paper on \"relations with investee companies - guidance on good practice\" on its website and says it is talking to the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators, which represents company secretaries and corporate governance managers, about establishing a timetable for investors to hold \"timely\" discussions with companies and so head off protests at annual meetings. The IMA has issued the guidelines following a meeting with the CBI in March, The aim was to ease the tensions caused by annual meeting protests by institutional share holders over boardroom pay which was not linked to performance. The IMA makes clear that it does not regard its paper as mandatory. \"The suggestions in this paper should not be read either as mandatory or an exhaustive list. They are intended to be examples drawn from experience which may help to facilitate good communications with companies in which fund managers investors.\" Of media relations it says: \"There is a widespread perception that damage can be caused to relations between companies and fund managers by public disagreement and unattributed press comments. \"While the circumstances by which such comments come to appear are sometimes contentious - unattributed comment in the media may not always reflect the actual words used by a fund manager - there is no doubt about the potential harm that can be done.\" The paper suggests fund managers have a written policy on media relations and a list of individuals who are authorised to speak to journalists. A \"particular concern\" for companies is when fund managers vote against management at an annual meeting without explaining why."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
