Two months after turning 21, he is thinking back to his days in the academy at Milton Keynes Dons, when he was trying to make a name for himself as a striker. Just not very successfully, as it turned out, judging by his memories of being removed from the team and told he might have to think again. \u201cI was on the bench a lot in the under-13s and then the manager [Dan Micciche] took the decision to pull me back and put me just in front of the defence. I wasn\u2019t as physically strong as the other boys at the age. He said it was so I could get more space, so I didn\u2019t have to worry about the physical battles and could just focus on my strengths, which at the time were getting on the ball and passing.\u201d The transition into a more attacking player came when he broke into the first team and, again, when he moved to Tottenham, where he recalls it feeling \u201cstrange to be playing so high up the pitch again\u201d and the first call-up from England arrived after six Premier League appearances \u2013 a decision that prompted something close to ridicule at the time. Roy Hodgson might not have got everything right as England manager, but nobody should question why he fast-tracked the player who is now the subject of rumoured interest from some of Europe\u2019s superpowers and has been named the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association young player of the year for the past two seasons. Yes, he was part of the England side that disintegrated against Iceland last summer but there can be no doubt he is one of the players Gareth Southgate wants to shape his team around. Alli will win his 18th cap when England renew acquaintances with Scotland at Hampden Park and it does not need long in his company to realise he is perfectly at ease with his elevated new status. \u201cI heard someone use this line about something else \u2013 that it\u2019s unbelievable, yet believable at the same time. When it\u2019s happening, there are moments when you can\u2019t believe this is happening, but then I think: \u2018I\u2019ve worked so hard for so long \u2013 so it is believable.\u2019 I wasn\u2019t expecting it to happen so quickly but you can\u2019t wait for time and when you get chucked in at the deep end you have to make sure you take the chance.\u201d He sounds supremely confident but grounded, too, smiling shyly when it is pointed out he has a better goals and assists record than Paul Scholes or Steven Gerrard at the same age and noting he has \u201ca lot to achieve before I can start thinking I\u2019m as good as them\u201d. Later he chastises himself for starting last season slowly \u2013 a hangover, he says, from the club\u2019s unsuccessful pursuit of Leicester City and the ordeal of Euro 2016, a tournament he would sooner forget. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t really until I come back here [with England], and Gareth coming in, that I\u2019ve even talked about it,\u201d he says of that Iceland game. \u201cUntil then you don\u2019t really want to talk about it, or even think about it, because it\u2019s such a hard thing. \u201cIt still makes your heart go and, even now, you get a lump in your throat but it\u2019s important, as a team, that when something like that happens you need to go through it and see where we went wrong. I\u2019m sure Gareth is aware of how hard it is to talk about it as players, with it being such a low point in our careers, but it\u2019s important that we do go to those dark places.\u201d His analysis of last season is that Spurs were \u201cphenomenal\u201d, even if they do not have any silverware to show for it, but it is tempting to wonder what he makes of the idea of a move abroad. \u201cPeople get too worried about where they are going to end up sometimes, then lose focus on the journey and don\u2019t enjoy it. I\u2019m signed to Tottenham and I\u2019m enjoying it. \u201cWho knows where I am going to end up, whether I stay at Tottenham for the rest of my career or if I do happen to go somewhere else. I\u2019m sure if it happens, if I do go somewhere else, it will be at a time when I think that\u2019s what\u2019s needed. But I am just looking forward to enjoying the journey.\u201d He is keeping his options open, in other words, but there is still plenty of time for all that when, lest it be forgotten, he will be one of the younger players on the pitch at Hampden Park, a game that leads to the inevitable question about whether someone with his temperament can be trusted to keep control. \u201cI know there are a lot of mixed opinions, but that\u2019s the player I am,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I was younger I always used to get into tackles and if Dan could see me losing my temper he\u2019d pull me off the pitch straight away and put me in the sin-bin. It\u2019s something that has always been in my game and it\u2019s not something I\u2019m looking to change. \u201cMaybe if I didn\u2019t have that in my game I wouldn\u2019t have achieved as much as I have done so far at this age. You don\u2019t want players to think they can walk all over you \u2026 it\u2019s important you stand your ground.\u201d That, however, does not mean he is oblivious to the fact he has crossed the line in the past. \u201cThere are things I regret, like the West Brom one,\u201d he says, referring to the off-the-ball incident with Claudio Yacob that resulted in a retrospective three-match ban for violent conduct. \u201cAfter that game I regretted it straight away. It was one of those moments I have learned from and I\u2019ve not done anything like that again. \u201cThere was also the challenge in the Europa League [a red-card tackle on Gent\u2019s Brecht Dejaegere]. I know it looked really bad \u2013 and it was a really bad tackle \u2013 but I also know I would never go out to hurt someone. It was just a poorly timed tackle. \u201cI apologised to the guy straight away. To be doing a challenge like that is horrible. Horrible for me as well, to think about it. I apologised and felt sorry and I\u2019ve learnt from it; it was a mistake.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
