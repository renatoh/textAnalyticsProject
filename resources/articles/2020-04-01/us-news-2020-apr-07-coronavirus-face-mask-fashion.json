Radin, who is recovering from a presumed case of Covid-19, took a selfie in the full ensemble and posted it on her Instagram. \u201cI\u2019ve been scrolling and will see other people post matching sets,\u201d says Radin, a former trend forecaster. \u201cThe mask is the new \u2018must-have accessory\u2019 \u2026 but literally. You must have it.\u201d After weeks of claiming otherwise, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently announced new guidelines to protect against the coronavirus, recommending people wear cotton face masks or cloth facial coverings when going outside. In just one day, a huge market opened up: the designer face mask. Corona-related demand has even enabled some fashion labels to reopen their factories, providing desperately needed supplies and, for some, self-expression amid chaos. Concern over the spread of coronavirus for months hasn\u2019t stopped Marie Lodi and her husband from exercising their love of kitsch. \u201cOur masks are really flamboyant and have hot pink tie-dye and Guy Fieri flames on them,\u201d says Lodi, a fashion writer and host of Fishnet Flix, a podcast about costume design. \u201cBecause we said if we are living in a pandemic and have to wear masks, then we might as well have some fun.\u201d Rather than ape the sterility of increasingly unavailable standard masks, which before the crisis might have retailed for as little as $0.44 per single-use item, the ones sold by indie designers and larger brands have playful styles fit for a public health crisis and springtime looks. Matrushka\u2019s $10 cotton masks, constructed out of fabric scraps from its couture studio, are colorful creations with aliens and cartoon cats front and center. \u201cIf having a cool non-medical grade mask with cats or unicorns or sharks on it makes things less scary [for all of us], I\u2019m happy,\u201d says Laura Howe, the brand\u2019s owner and designer. \u201cI don\u2019t like the idea of us all looking the same: sad, scared, behind the same kind of mask.\u201d Men\u2019s sporting gear retailer Ball and Buck is selling a camo print face mask. Maison Modulare has sold out of their French lace mask, a more expensive item priced at $60. Los Angeles Apparel, the successor to American Apparel, is offering FACEMASK3, a three-pack of masks made of French Terry fabric, available in nine colors. \u201cI felt like this is what I\u2019d been training for,\u201d says Grisel Lopez, a designer for Possessed, fetishwear line which produces neon-colored PVC masks that can be sanitized. \u201cThe government is not stepping up,\u201d adds MI Leggett, founder of Official Rebrand, which uses upcycled materials. \u201cMaking masks is something I had to do.\u201d Major brands such as Christian Siriano, Zara, H&amp;M and Prada are using their factories to produce necessities solely for medical staff. Some smaller companies have one-for-one initiatives: for each mask sold, they donate another to essential workers. After the CDC released its new guidelines, Naomi Mishkin, owner of Naomi Nomi, says she has received 5,000 orders for her cotton masks, meaning the same number will go to first responders. Like many indie designers, she has been able to re-open her factory and get her team back to work. \u201cFashion brands who have been able to pivot to making masks right now are crucial,\u201d says Marie Lodi. \u201cEveryone benefits: the brands who are losing money, the healthcare workers, and the civilians who are in need of masks.\u201d Yet, as is the case when any moral effort is commodified, some who are familiar with the fashion industry have concerns. \u201cAs the pandemic continues to spread, I anticipate that some high-end brands might charge higher prices [for masks] and capitalize on the fact that people are scared,\u201d says Gianluca Russo, a style reporter for Teen Vogue. There are also sustainability issues plaguing fast fashion manufacturers, from environmental harm to labor abuses. It may only be a matter of time before titans such as H&amp;M and Zara, with their \u201cproblematic production models\u201d, as Radin says, pivot from making medical masks to ones for consumers. \u201cIf coronavirus goes on for an extended period of time and masks become bigger parts of our daily lives, we need to produce them [humanely],\u201d Radin says. \u201cIt\u2019d be great if people buying masks could instead put their dollars into smaller companies or indie brands.\u201d Could the mask trend continue when we stop social distancing and Covid-19 is less of a threat? Masks have long been a regular feature of daily life in east Asia, for fashion and for health purposes, and are sometimes considered a sign of the wearer\u2019s social responsibility. \u201cWhether it will take off as a fashion trend here in the US depends on whether stigma around wearing a mask can be changed,\u201d says Christine Wu, a fashion anthropologist and former lecturer at the Parsons School of Design. \u201cWe hold on to memories through the clothing we wear,\u201d adds fashion writer Gabriela Herstik. \u201cThe collective trauma of Covid will be ingrained, and I think a lot of us are going to keep wearing our masks when this is over, like a safety blanket.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
