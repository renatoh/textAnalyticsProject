Since losing the leadership Tony Abbott has been one of the most vocal supporters of the Warringah motion \u2013 a proposal to allow members a vote in their local preselection of candidates and office bearers. Asked whether he accepted there would be plebiscites in the Liberal party by the end of this weekend\u2019s state Liberal convention, Zimmerman said: \u201cI think that that is where the party is heading\u201d. But he urged the 1,500 members registered to attend to be prepared to compromise. Rival groups have prepared alternative proposals in a bid to knock off the Warringah motion. The two rival motions are proposed by Liberal backbencher Julian Leeser and assistant immigration minister, Alex Hawke. They both propose eligibility rules such as activity tests, waiting periods and protections for all existing sitting MPs. \u201cEvery delegate has to be prepared to look at reasonable compromise,\u201d Zimmerman said. \u201cWe have to ensure that those participating in preselections are genuine and active members because we don\u2019t want to see the system rigged. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to see preselections being determined by people whose bona fides we just simply don\u2019t know. That\u2019s at the heart of what Julian Leeser and Alex Hawke have proposed.\u201d The battlelines have been drawn for the extraordinary Futures convention over preselection rules after a six year campaign by former member John Ruddick and Abbott\u2019s Warringah federal electorate conference president Walter Villatora. If the rules changed, it is likely the moderate faction would lose control of preselections and the party\u2019s ruling body, the state executive, to the Liberal party\u2019s more conservative ordinary membership. The Warringah supporters emailed members on Thursday night, claiming speakers pushing their cause included ethicist Simon Longstaff, of the St James Ethics Centre, Marcus Bastiaan, of the Victorian Liberal state executive and Dallas McInerney, president of the Whitlam federal electorate conference. McInerney is also head of government relations for the National Australia Bank. Speaking in favour of a compromise are the federal urban infrastructure minister Paul Fletcher, NSW Liberal MLC Peter Phelps and Hills Shire mayor Yvonne Keane. But even if the Warringah passes at the convention, it would still need to pass the party\u2019s ruling body, the state executive, which has resisted plebiscites to date. Malcolm Turnbull has spoken in favour of more open preselections but has been careful not to express a preference for which model while Abbott has pushed the Warringah motion since he lost the leadership. On Thursday, Scott Morrison also supported democratisation of his state\u2019s preselection rules but would not commit to how it should be done. Asked if he supported plebiscites in which ordinary members get a vote in preselection of candidates, Morrison said: \u201cI\u2019ve always been in favour of democratisation in the Liberal party, wherever it is.\u201d Speaking ahead of the NSW Liberal futures convention on the weekend, Morrison said as a former director of the party in NSW it was a decision for the members. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s my job, as a parliamentary member of the Liberal party, to be going round lecturing the organisational wing about how it should be done. That\u2019s a matter for our organisation. \u201cI\u2019m a fierce defender of the organisational wing of the Liberal party to make its decisions on the issues that are within its domain.\u201d Both the prime minister and NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, will speak at the convention at Rosehill racecourse on Saturday before debates on motions over the preselection rules on Sunday. The lead-up to the event has been marked by claim and counter-claim, as a war has broken out between supporters of the Warringah motion and its opponents, who say open preselections would lead to branch stacking. Warringah motion supporters such as retired major general Jim Molan and Villatora, have described their state division as infected with a culture of rorts and lobbyists, and Ruddick has predicted the party will split unless open plebiscites are introduced. There are some 1,500 members registered for the convention which itself has become tainted by accusations of stacking after Fairfax reported 200 registrations had been paid for by Warringah motion supporters. This has been denied by some Warringah supporters, who told Guardian Australia only 20 registrations were covered for \u201chardship cases\u201d. It is within the rules to pay for multiple memberships. A senior Liberal source told Guardian Australia that one credit card had funded 100 registrations. The claims have flourished because NSW Liberal rules do not allow ordinary members to speak on party organisational matters. But earlier this week, Molan deliberately flouted the rules after he was interviewed by broadcaster Alan Jones about plebiscites."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
