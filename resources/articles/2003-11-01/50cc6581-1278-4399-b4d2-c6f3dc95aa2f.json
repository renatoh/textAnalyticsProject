Isn't that rather rude? No, not in this case. Why's that then? Because if you get this job, that's exactly what you will be doing. I hope this isn't a job as a speech writer for Lord Tebbit? No, no spin doctors here. Then I'm all ears. What's the job? To promote the benefits of cycling to disadvantaged communities across London. What communities specifically? Black and minority ethnic, refugees and asylum seekers. Why focus on these groups? To help reduce social exclusion and improve their health. Hey, I've just had a thought. What's that? Promoting health through cycling sounds like a real \"spin doctor\". Clever, aren't you? Seems so. What does the job involve? Working with appropriate organisations, organising training events, and coordinating the campaign. Sounds good. What sort of person are they looking for? Someone with experience of working with these groups to promote health or address social exclusion. How much would I earn, and how can I find out more? \u00a314,500 for a three-day week. Visit the website at www.lcc.org.uk Thanks, I will. At the interview, don't say: The last bike I was on had stabilisers. Do say: A pedal a day keeps the doctor away."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
