And evidently it is true because just as most observers had seemingly accepted that Nigel Pearson\u2019s team would be returning to the Championship with their bushy tails between their legs, the Foxes have gone on the charge. They are now tantalisingly close to breaking free from the relegation zone, a solitary goal behind 17th-placed Hull City. After each of their 19 league matches before this win over Swansea City, Leicester\u2019s players had walked off the pitch to find that they were still bottom of the league. Only three games ago they were seven points adrift of 17th place. Yet despondency never took hold. Although they have lost more Premier League matches than any team other than Queens Park Rangers, none of those defeats were severe enough to convince Leicester\u2019s players that they were out of their depth. Their performances were generally encouraging. Pearson maintained that results would eventually come \u2013 and most people at the King Power Stadium shared that faith. When it emerged that one fan vented his frustration at Pearson in December after a defeat that extended the club\u2019s winless streak to nine matches, the majority of Leicester supporters expressed their backing for the manager, even though his intemperate response to the abusive fan earned him a one-match ban from the Football Association. Then there was that curious incident in February after the home defeat by Crystal Palace and Pearson\u2019s bizarre clash during that game with the visiting midfielder James McArthur. The next day Pearson had a meeting with his employers and reportedly formed the impression that they had lost patience with him, before the club announced moments later that, no, he had not been sacked. All very odd and amid it all victory kept eluding Leicester \u2013 but the Foxes never quit. The turning point, according to the midfielder Marc Albrighton, came two weeks ago when a late Andy King goal at home to West Ham brought a 2-1 win and the belief that, finally, Leicester were rewarded appropriately for a positive performance. \u201cThe way that we won the West Ham game \u2013 a late goal and the place was rocking \u2013 it just left everyone on a high,\u201d says Albrighton. \u201cI probably would say mentally throughout the club, not just the players but the supporters, it gave everyone a lift that we can do it.\u201d That belief was further boosted by last week\u2019s win at West Bromwich Albion, thanks to another late goal, and it was palpable against Swansea, when the King Power was once again heaving with raucous optimism and Leicester\u2019s players seemed to be powered by the conviction that they can ensure their campaign ends with a glorious escape. The Swansea manager, Garry Monk, admitted his team were outfought in the opening 20 minutes, by which time Leicester were in front thanks to Leonardo Ulloa\u2019s first league goal of 2015. The Argentinian would not even have started if David Nugent had not broken down in the warm-up with calf trouble \u2013 another sign, perhaps, that fortune is starting to smile on Leicester. Many times this season Leicester have let themselves down with wayward finishing and they spurned several chances to increase their lead against Swansea, leading to fears that the visitors could punish them. However, Kasper Schmeichel made a superb save to deny N\u00e9lson Oliveira in the second half and the hosts eventually granted themselves breathing space with another late goal from King, who slotted in the rebound after Lukasz Fabianski spilled a free-kick from Esteban Cambiasso, the veteran Argentinian who was again magnificent in Leicester\u2019s midfield. \u201cThe confidence going through the team is really high now,\u201d says Albrighton, who also excelled in midfield on only his fourth start of the season. His introduction to the side against West Ham and continued inclusion since then has been another factor in the turnaround. \u201cIf we can just keep this going we will be OK.\u201d Given the rousing atmosphere at the King Power now, it could prove crucial that four of Leicester\u2019s last six matches are in their own den. Those games also include meetings with the two sides now below them, Burnley and QPR, and one just above them, Sunderland. The Foxes have really set the cat among the pigeons.
