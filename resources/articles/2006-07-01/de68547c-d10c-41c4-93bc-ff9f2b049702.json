Conflict in the Middle East prompted oil-producing countries to limit supplies of crude to the west, and the five-fold increase in prices that resulted brought the long post-war boom to a shuddering halt. The arrival of stagflation - rising unemployment and higher inflation - led French president Val\u00e9ry Giscard D'Estaing to convene the first world economic summit at Rambouillet in 1975. Over the years, though, the amount of time spent discussing the global economy has dwindled as the participants have grown more confident about the prospects for growth and inflation. This year is different. St Petersburg is a throwback to an earlier era. Once again the Middle East is in turmoil. Once again the oil price is rising sharply. And although the global economy has just recorded its fastest period of prolonged expansion since the early 1970s, there is real concern that the good times are about to come to an end. Africa, the focus of the G8 summit Britain hosted at Gleneagles last year, has dropped well down the agenda, as the west concentrates on the crisis in the Middle East. Naturally, there are differences. Demand for crude has risen since the mid-1970s, but the drift in the west away from manufacturing and towards services has meant each unit of output requires less oil than it did three decades ago. Despite a three-fold increase in oil prices since the start of 2003, inflation is less of a problem than it was in the early 1970s, when even before the Yom Kippur war there were signs that tight labour markets and America's costly war in Vietnam were putting upward pressure on the cost of living. The fact that Russia is hosting the G8 this year - and that China will take part in talks on trade today - also points to a changing international climate since 1973. Capitalism won the cold war, and a far more integrated global economy increasingly feels the presence of low-cost developing countries. Indeed, the spread of the market to China and the former Soviet bloc, together with liberalisation of the Indian economy, helps explain why inflation is so low. But not everything has changed for the better. Closer integration has been accompanied by two worrying trends: the global economy is both unbalanced and synchronised. What does this mean? It means that, unusually, every bit of the world economy is growing robustly (or relatively robustly) at the same time, but in very different ways. China's growth, for example, depends heavily on the willingness of American consumers to live beyond their means. The fear is that it would only take the US to falter in order to set off a chain reaction. That is what concerns the International Monetary Fund. Rodrigo de Rato, its managing director, has begun consultations with the countries seen as vital to solving the problem of the global economic imbalances. Joint talks, he believes, could persuade the Americans to consume less and export more; the Chinese and Japanese to save less. By the time the fund holds its annual meeting in Singapore in two months, there will be a clearer indication of whether de Rato can help finesse a soft landing. This is still a real possibility. A crucial factor behind the growth in the global economy over the past four years has been the cheap money pumped into the system by central banks. In Japan, interest rates were cut to zero; in the United States they reached 1%; in the eurozone they hit 2%. The days of ultra-cheap borrowing are now over; central banks are gradually pushing up interest rates in an attempt to staunch inflationary pressures without causing recession. The betting in the financial markets is that the monetary authorities will be successful, and that the immediate outlook is for a moderation of growth in the second half of 2006, but nothing worse than that. Analysts point out that hard landings are rather less common than might be imagined, and that the global economy has enough momentum to see it through short-term difficulties. It has to be said, however, that the current concatenation of events has the potential to derail the global economy. Oil prices, when adjusted for inflation, are not yet back to the levels of the early 1980s, but they are heading that way. 'Arc of extremism' The escalation of violence in Lebanon and Israel over the weekend makes it a real possibility that the price of crude will hit $80 a barrel today, and if Iran and Syria become directly involved in the crisis, it is perfectly conceivable that speculation could drive it up to $100 a barrel. Tony Blair talked yesterday of an \"arc of extremism\" across the Middle East, words that don't inspire a great deal of confidence that energy costs are about to come down. Moreover, while it is certainly true that production in the west is less energy-intensive than it once was, rising oil prices still hurt. In Britain, for example, fuel and raw material costs for industry are going up at double-digit rates, but intense competition is limiting the ability of firms to pass on the increases to their customers. Similarly, consumers have seen stonking increases in their domestic energy bills this spring, and are now facing the real prospect of petrol at \u00a31 a litre. With pay increases only barely keeping pace with inflation, the only way to maintain spending levels is to borrow more, and after the credit binge of recent years there seems limited appetite for that. As such, it would be complacent to assume that the ability, so far, of the global economy to shrug off the increase in oil prices since early 2003 means it will continue to be able to do so. There have been three serious downturns in the global economy since 1973, and each has been preceded by a spike in oil prices. It is worth mentioning, in passing, that each has also been associated with a crisis in the Middle East; the Yom Kippur war, the war between Iran and Iraq and the invasion of Kuwait by Saddam Hussein in 1990. So what can the G8 do? Not that much, in all honesty. Despite the end of the cold war, the line up of forces within the club is little different from what it was in 1973; the White House backs Israel, the Kremlin quietly supports Syria. There was little sign in St Petersburg yesterday that the G8 could, or would, do anything to halt the violence. One thing the G8 could do today is end the stalemate in the global trade talks, and there were signs yesterday that the gloomy news from the Middle East had the effect of concentrating minds. The summit will call for the Doha round of liberalisation negotiations, which have limped on for almost five years, to show a breakthrough within the next month. In effect, given Europe goes on holiday at the start of August, that means the next two weeks. Perhaps chastened by the consequences of his go-it-alone approach in Iraq, President Bush gave strong support yesterday to Mr Blair's attempt to avoid the damaging blow to the multilateral trading system that a collapse of the talks would entail. The deal now in the offing is not dramatic and would do little to prevent a severe downturn triggered by spiralling energy costs, higher interest rates and an unravelling of the global imbalances. But the G8 may take the view, as missiles rain down on Beirut and Haifa, that now would not be a good time to fan the flames of protectionism. larry.elliott@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
