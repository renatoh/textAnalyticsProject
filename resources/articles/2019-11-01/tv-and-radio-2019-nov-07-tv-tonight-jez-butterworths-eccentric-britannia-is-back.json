As we return, Rome has a foothold: the natives appear to be faced with submission to Roman authority or death. But it\u2019s hard to imagine Britannia\u2019s oddball mystics and savage warrior queens respecting such binary options. The fun is greatly enhanced by the arrival of Steve Pemberton as the piles-afflicted emperor Claudius. Phil Harrison Giri/Haji 9pm, BBC Two Another tremendous episode sees the Anglo-Japanese thriller gracefully bend in on itself to tell the backstories of Yuto and Sarah via a series of flashbacks \u2013 one a tale of forbidden love, the other a fable of love gone slowly but horribly wrong. Then it\u2019s back to the massive restaurant shootout. Jack Seale Charles: 50 Years a Prince 9pm, ITV In 1969, half a billion people watched the formal Prince-ing up of Charles in a ceremony at Caernarfon castle, some of whom (Welsh nationalists) weren\u2019t happy about it. Fifty years on, this follows Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall on their annual Welsh tour. But still, that title\u2019s gotta sting a bit, hasn\u2019t it? Ali Catterall The Accident 9pm, Channel 4 The bleak drama exploring the impact of an industrial accident on a small Welsh town reaches its penultimate part. Its creator, Jack Thorne, has cleverly itemised the gradual taking of sides, and this process continues as the inquest begins and versions of events become even more contested. Will Polly betray Iwan? PH The Fall of the Berlin Wall With John Simpson 9pm, BBC Four Simpson recalls \u201cone of the great days of modern human existence\u201d. He contextualises events and explains how unlikely they seemed. There\u2019s also an acknowledgment that subsequent history hasn\u2019t panned out as smoothly as he imagined. PH The Russell Howard Hour 10pm, Sky One After Howard\u2019s success on BBC Three, the fresh-faced standup signed a deal with Sky in 2016. His topical chatshow has been a hit, securing fascinating celebs like Louis Theroux, Jon Ronson and Naomi Klein for extended chats. As season three kicks off, the main guest is TBC, although an Aisling Bea cameo is promised. Graeme Virtue Film choice The Conversation, 1.30am, Sky Cinema Greats Francis Ford Coppola knocked out this compelling tale of obsession between Godfathers I and II. Gene Hackman is superb as surveillance expert Harry Caul, tipped into increasingly paranoid suspicions as businessman Robert Duvall draws him into a murder plot.
