They conceded an equaliser here in the 89th minute that was galling for the visitors. Lee Bowyer's strike was allowed although there were multiple reasons for it to be disallowed. A cross from Roger Johnson came off the arm of the substitute Nikola Zigic, who had been fouling Rio Ferdinand, and fell for the midfielder to score. Regardless of the sense of injustice, Birmingham City can only be admired. They may have been short of the artistry to cause United real alarm, but Alex McLeish's side are still formidable at St Andrew's, where only Everton have defeated them in the last 28 matches. Sir Alex Ferguson appreciated the extent of the challenge and sent out a strong line-up despite the call for variation over the course of the festive period. United were wronged, but will reproach themselves a little for not finishing off the opposition. Wayne Rooney had another of his vapid performances and the dependence on Dimitar Berbatov up front was therefore marked. The opener here was his eighth in the past three league matches alone, but it did not arrive until the 58th minute. The tenacity and endeavour of Birmingham ensured that there would be no swift assumption of command by United. It was not even apparent the visitors were all that better equipped for the contest in the first half. Ferguson's team had already had enough difficulty on their travels, where the sole league win was at Stoke. The United players might have been telling themselves that they could weather the bouts of boldness from Birmingham that did not often pose a direct threat to the goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar. Even so, McLeish's men had the reassurance of knowing they had only conceded half-a-dozen goals at St Andrew's in the league. That part, at least, of the home record was the equal of United's. But McLeish has to develop a squad with a survivalist view of the world that can also pounce here and there for a goal, as they ultimately did on this grand occasion for the club. The worry is, of course, that such a team may turn fatalistic if it does fall behind, but that flaw is not in the Birmingham mentality. United ultimately had a fine prospect of victory, but Birmingham had also showed the conviction to avoid huddling close to their own penalty area. The hazards involved in that were illustrated after 18 minutes when it took a touch by their goalkeeper Ben Foster to put an attempt by Ryan Giggs against the post. Birmingham themselves had so genuine an intent to attack that Nemanja Vidic brought down Cameron Jerome as he was on the verge of going clear in the 30th minute, but the centre-half was merely cautioned since Rio Ferdinand was close enough to be deemed a covering defender. The hosts were showing then an intent to carry the game to Ferguson's side even if the degree of artistry fluctuated. It was easy to see why McLeish had not lost in the Premier League here to one of the established Champions League clubs since Chelsea won in January 2008. Apart from any menace shown in this game, the endeavour prevented United from finding the rhythm that would have put them in command. Sir Alex Ferguson's side did not establish control but the sheer deftness of Berbatov brought the opener in the 58th minute. His flick released Darron Gibson on the right and the Bulgarian took the return to shoot low past Foster at his near post. It was Berbatov's 14th league goal of the campaign and it had been clear well before this night that he is a mainstay for United. Birmingham, for their part, are not in the habit of needing to take the game to opponents of this calibre at St Andrew's. Nonetheless there had never been timidity to hamper them. What they understandably lacked was the touch of refinement that is the essence of Berbatov. The match grew a little quieter with the referee Lee Mason's yellow card going through a quite spell. McLeish took the natural step of sending the skilled Aleksandr Hleb on in place of Sebastian Larsson, who had worked hard in an attempt to take the play to United. The visitors, of course, enjoy great advantages and when Anderson went off injured his place could go to the most effective Darren Fletcher. Yet Birmingham had an answer, highly dubious though it was."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
