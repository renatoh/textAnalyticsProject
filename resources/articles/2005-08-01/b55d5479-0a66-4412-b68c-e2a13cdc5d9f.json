Contrary to the views of Norman Tebbit, identity is not an absolute. Multiple identities are a normality. Who can forget the father of Amir Khan, the boxing silver-medallist in the Athens Olympics, wearing his Union Jack waistcoat over a Pakistan T-shirt at the ringside? Yet such ideas remain incendiary for tabloid commentators. The Mail called Ms Blears's comments \"cringe-making\". The Express ran the story under a headline declaring \"Fury over the rebranding of ethnic minorities\". Nor were there many more cheers among ethnic minority communities. Ghayasuddin Siddiqui, head of the Muslim parliament, saw the idea as a step backwards: \"Nobody cares for labels. We have to create an inclusive society. Some young people say to me: 'We have British passports but are treated as Pakis'.\" Sir Iqbal Sacranie of the Muslim Council of Britain was opposed too: \"These forms of identity based on ethnic background have been tried in the past and have failed.\" Shahid Malik, a Labour MP, said Ms Blears was right in recognising the issue, but had hit on the wrong solution. Yet Ms Blears is not totally isolated. The Commission for Racial Equality was sympathetic but saw possible pitfalls. The journalist Yasmin Alibhai-Brown liked the idea because the term ethnic minority \"ghettoises us\". Ironically, the last census already had a question on ethnic grouping which included a \"Black British\" tick-box. It was there because, during the 1991 census, many parents objected to their children being classified as \"West Indian\" when they had been born here. By 2001 the census had boxes for Scottish, Irish and British - but none for Welsh or English. Although the vast majority of people from ethnic minority groups live in England, a survey by the Office for National Statistics showed that most regard themselves as British but not English. No democratic government should impose a definition of identity on its citizens that they do not want. But, in fairness, that was not Ms Blears's suggestion. Those who prefer a hyphen should be free to use it, as many do - but do not have to - in the US. Even there, the idea was not free from controversy. A century ago Theodore Roosevelt tried to get hyphens dropped. Yet many communities preferred to hold on to their hyphens, while some still draw strength and comfort from them to this day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
