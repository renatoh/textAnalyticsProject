He has always given careful thought to his staging. His introduction to The Apprentice, driven to the thumping beat of For the Love of Money, showed the master of the universe striding from a limousine at Trump Tower, riding in a Trump helicopter and climbing the ramp of a Trump airplane. Now, however, he will display himself on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. With the illuminated statue of the 16th president as his backdrop, Trump will highlight the magnitude of his own greatness by standing in reflected glory. Or maybe Trump thinks it\u2019s the other way around and he, not Lincoln, will be the radiant one. Since becoming president, Trump\u2019s estimation of Lincoln has declined even as his estimation of himself has inflated. In 2017, Trump was willing to concede that Lincoln was the greatest president, saying: \u201cWith the exception of the late, great Abraham Lincoln, I can be more presidential than any president that\u2019s ever held this office.\u201d By the next year, he had eclipsed Lincoln in his mind, proclaiming: \u201cYou know, a poll just came out that I am the most popular person in the history of the Republican party. Beating Lincoln. I beat our Honest Abe.\u201d (Of course, there were no polls in the 19th century.) Then, this year, bringing the Boston Red Sox into the Lincoln Bedroom, according to the Red Sox chairman, Tom Werner, Trump \u201cwas talking about Abraham Lincoln losing the war, and he said I know you guys lost a game or two but this was a war\u201d. Lincoln? Loser. Trump\u2019s most recent reflection on his competition with Lincoln came in his interview with George Stephanopoulos, broadcast on 16 June on ABC News, in which he blurted: \u201cIf you can believe it, Abraham Lincoln was treated supposedly very badly, but nobody\u2019s been treated badly like me.\u201d Just two weeks earlier, on 2 June, he had delivered a brief speech written for him at the gala of Ford\u2019s Theatre, praising Lincoln\u2019s \u201ceternal legacy\u201d. Left to his own devices, demoting the \u201csupposedly\u201d tragic event at that theater, Trump rated himself superior as a martyr. On 4 July, while Trump mugs on the Mall, the marble Lincoln will maintain a dignified silence. Many have wondered what Lincoln might say if confronted by the people and events of their time. In 1914, at the beginning of the first world war, the poet Vachel Lindsay, in Abraham Lincoln Walks at Midnight, portrayed a ghostly Lincoln deploring the conflagration. But we do not have to wonder what Lincoln might say about demagogic exploitation of the Fourth of July or hypocritical displays about the ideals of the Declaration of Independence. His statements on the subject were voluminous, plain and scathing. Here is a small sample: To a friend, 15 August 1855: On the question of liberty, as a principle, we are not what we have been. When we were the political slaves of King George, and wanted to be free, we called the maxim that \u2018all men are created equal,\u2019 a self-evident truth; but now when we have grown fat, and have lost all dread of being slaves ourselves, we have become so greedy to be masters that we call the same maxim \u2018a self-evident lie.\u2019 The Fourth of July has not quite dwindled away; it is still a great day \u2013 for burning fire-crackers!!! More than the expropriation of Independence Day to justify slavery agitated Lincoln. A week later, on 24 August, he wrote his close friend Joshua Speed to complain about the rising anti-immigrant, nativist and super-patriotic Know Nothing party as a duplicitous mockery of the Declaration of Independence: As a nation, we began by declaring that \u2018all men are created equal.\u2019 We now practically read it \u2018all men are created equal, except negroes.\u2019 When the Know-Nothings get control, it will read \u2018all men are created equal, except negroes, and foreigners, and Catholics.\u2019 When it comes to this I should prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretense of loving liberty \u2013 to Russia, for instance, where despotism can be taken pure, and without the base alloy of hypocrisy. During his famous debates with the racist demagogue Stephen A Douglas in 1858, Lincoln ridiculed Douglas\u2019s denial that the Declaration stood for human equality. In notes preparing for those debates, Lincoln spelled out what both supporters of slavery and those calculatingly indifferent to it were doing, which was: \u2026 to subvert, in the public mind, and in practical administration, our old and only standard of free government, that \u2018all men are created equal,\u2019 and to substitute for it some different standard. What that substitute is to be is not difficult to perceive. It is to deny the equality of men, and to assert the natural, moral, and religious right of one class to enslave another.\u201d In February 1861, after his election as president, on his way to Washington, Lincoln spoke at Independence Hall in Philadelphia, and declared: I have never had a feeling politically that did not spring from the sentiments embodied in the Declaration of Independence \u2026 If [the country] can\u2019t be saved upon that principle, it will be truly awful. But, if this country cannot be saved without giving up that principle \u2013 I was about to say I would rather be assassinated on this spot than to surrender it. It should not be surprising that as the emotional intensity of Trump\u2019s defense of Confederate monuments since Charlottesville has risen, his opinion of Lincoln has fallen. The man who boasts he has never read a biography of a president actually shows a rudimentary if warped sense of history. But Lincoln had more than a little to say about the cause of the Confederacy, which was slavery: I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world \u2013 enables the enemies of free institutions, with plausibility, to taunt us as hypocrites \u2013 causes the real friends of freedom to doubt our sincerity, and especially because it forces so many really good men amongst ourselves into an open war with the very fundamental principles of civil liberty \u2013 criticizing the Declaration of Independence, and insisting that there is no right principle of action but self-interest. Next year, Trump should simply reserve his Fourth of July festivity to the Trump hotel or the Russian embassy. In such settings he can celebrate himself, as Lincoln said, \u201cwithout the base alloy of hypocrisy\u201d.
