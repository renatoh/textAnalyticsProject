Berti Vogts will play his strongest available line-up against Norway but will have one eye on Iceland's result in the Faroes in their Euro 2004 qualifier conscious that they could move four points clear of Scotland and to the top of Group Five should they win where the Scots could only draw. Yet Vogts's best player could also be forgiven a rather blurred outlook. Barry Ferguson will trot out for his 16th cap with his long-standing pelvic injury cured but his future in a state of flux. The 25-year-old has attracted interest from Blackburn and, though Rangers dismissed Graeme Souness's tentative inquiry, if the Ibrox club fail to edge beyond FC Copenhagen into the Champions League next week, spiralling debts of \u00a360m may force them into a sale. \"Barry hasn't come across as being unsettled by all the speculation,\" said Vogts, who was without Ferguson for June's impressive draw with Germany. \"He's a professional and he knows the situation. There's a lot of pressure on him at this level, as well as the pressure on him to succeed at Rangers. After all, there's a \u00a310m difference between Champions League and Uefa Cup football. \"He could play in the Premier League, in Spain, Germany or Italy. He scored 19 goals from midfield last season, more than Michael Ballack. He's tough, a leader on the pitch and a strong character. He's my captain of the future. \"He's a new Barry Ferguson since the operation. He doesn't start the day with painkillers, or take more after every training session. He's left all that behind him and he's bubbly and always smiling.\" Ferguson can prove his quality at the Ullevaal Stadium where he will be confronted by a Norway side laced with Premiership talent, even if they have underachieved in qualifying. Languishing behind Denmark in Group Two, they may even meet the Scots in a Euro 2004 play-off, with their coach Nils Johan Semb under as much pressure as Vogts to succeed. \"All international managers are under pressure,\" added the German. \"Even Sir Alex Ferguson and that guy from Chelsea feel it. I think Iceland will beat the Faroes, though we have three qualifiers remaining and I'm sure we can win our two home games [against the Faroes and Lithuania] and pick up a point in Germany. That will be enough. In the meantime, this will be a useful test.\" Norway (probable 4-4-2): Olsen ; Bergdolmo , R Johnsen , Berg , Riise ; F Johnsen , Basma , Solli , Andresen ; Solskjaer , Carew . Scotland (probable, 4-1-3-2): Douglas (Celtic); Ross (Rangers), Pressley , Webster (both Hearts), Naysmith (Everton); Dailly (West Ham); Cameron (Wolves), Ferguson (Rangers), Lambert (Celtic); Crawford (Dunfermline), Hutchison (West Ham)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
