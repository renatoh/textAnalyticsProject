Such verdicts may have to be revised if squad members end up clinging to lampposts or struggling to stay upright in winds expected to reach more than 100mph on Saturday. Having been delayed for eight hours by a storm on arrival last month, England should know extreme events \u2013 two minor earthquakes have also caused tremors in Tokyo this week \u2013 are relatively common here. Should the worst scenario unfold and the game against France in Yokohama has to be shifted or cancelled, England\u2019s belief they have planned for every eventuality will be tested. No one can second guess the weather but if the match does not happen Eddie Jones\u2019s squad will arrive in the quarter-finals having barely been required to go beyond second gear. Mitchell knows more about World Cup knockout preparation than most, having been New Zealand\u2019s coach in 2003 when they were bundled out in the semi-finals by Jones\u2019s Wallabies. In his view it is a waste of emotional energy to start worrying prematurely without having the precise meteorological facts to hand. \u201cWhatever is thrown at us we\u2019ll deal with it. We want to play and we\u2019re looking forward to playing France. We believe that will happen. We won\u2019t be giving any other information to our players that\u2019s not really definite.\u201d Arguably even more alien than the anticipated wind and rain would be playing a Test behind closed doors, a possibility should the organisers deem it a better option than sticking to the pool rules and declaring a 0-0 draw. Both nations have already qualified but Mitchell is not a fan of the empty stadium possibility. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be good for the game if that was the case. I\u2019m sure World Rugby, in their wisdom, would consider having a stadium full of people.\u201d If or when the game proceeds it will certainly be a blessing for Henry Slade, still waiting to start his first match of the tournament. The fit-again Exeter centre will feature in the No 13 shirt and is not remotely concerned by some of the tough talk emerging from the France camp this week. \u201cWe know they have a lot of threats across the park and they have some dangerous guys but so do we. If they want to try and kill us then good luck, we have got some big lads.\u201d Slade is also intent on putting pressure on the management, with Manu Tuilagi having occupied the outside-centre berth in England\u2019s recent big games, but will fully embrace whatever role he is given. \u201cYou want to play but if you\u2019re telling me I could play all 80 minutes of every pool game and lose in the quarter-finals or not play much and win the World Cup then I\u2019m 100% going to take winning the World Cup. It doesn\u2019t matter how we do it, we\u2019re together as a 31.\u201d That mindset is reflected in the reshuffled deck to face France, with injuries to Billy Vunipola, Joe Marler and Jack Nowell also forcing Jones\u2019s hand. Mitchell remains adamant none of the trio is a long-term concern but concedes a hamstring tweak is further complicating Nowell\u2019s bid to gain more game time. \u201cJack will be getting slightly frustrated,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWe feel for him. He\u2019s had knee and ankle injuries in the Premiership final, then appendicitis, then another little niggle. At least you saw a moment of brilliance \u2013 that upper body strength and power \u2013 to score his try against Argentina last Saturday. He\u2019ll have taken a lot of satisfaction from that.\u201d Weather permitting, Slade says England are confident of dealing with France whoever plays. \u201cWe have had some good performances over the last few weeks and we want to keep the train rolling. \u201cYou don\u2019t want it to hit too many bumps along the way. We have to attack this game like it is the only thing that matters.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
