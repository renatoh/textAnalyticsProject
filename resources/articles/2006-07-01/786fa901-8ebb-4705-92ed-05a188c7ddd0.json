For the scores of interviews he gave were nominally generated by the G8 summit. Yet all the journalists wanted to raise with Tony Blair was cash for honours and his own future. For the moment, the two appear closely linked. It is a fine time for Westminster to pack up for a 10-week break during a period that is undermining not just the prime minister but our whole political culture, now as tatty as it has been perhaps since the advent of universal suffrage. Each new twist in the tale of how the main political parties raise funds further inflames a sense of disconnection between people and power. This is not about political apathy. For this sense of inaccessibility, this lack of influence, is now corroding not the casual voter but the enthusiasm of the activist. As the education secretary, Alan Johnson, admitted yesterday, it is \"awful\" for the Labour party. Reports of morale in the constituencies are grim. Conservatives may be less affronted by their own fundraising techniques, but they are deeply unhappy with many of the seemingly unilateral decisions emerging from David Cameron's camp. Of course there are the familiar problems of a government in its 10th year in office on the one hand, and a party leader trying to move his followers outside their comfort zone on the other. But added to that there is a damaging sense of a cross-party governing class that operates in its own universe, without reference to the wider world. The sinews of party politics are being eaten away. Government is never easy, and gets harder over time. The environment in which it functions has become hostile to what it is for. In order to preserve the public domain against the atomisation of society and the tyranny of choice, a progressive government is compelled to cling to central control even as it acknowledges that it is the local and the personal that most engage voters' attention. In their own flawed way, ministers believe that public-service reform is a way of accommodating the universal provision of the postwar settlement with the universal individualism of the 21st century. But the over-hasty, under-explained pursuit of change has squandered public confidence, and the party-loans scandal reinforces disenchantment. It's not dead, nor even dying, but big government and the big parties that provide people to run it look dangerously diseased. Transparency is an essential part of the cure, in fundraising and in government too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
