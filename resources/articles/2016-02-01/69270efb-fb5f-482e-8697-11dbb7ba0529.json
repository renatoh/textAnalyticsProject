Changes are also set to be made to the starting XV that beat Scotland last Saturday. There will not be sweeping alterations to England\u2019s team but Jones says he may \u201cconceivably pick a faster pack\u201d as he seeks to transform last autumn\u2019s World Cup plodders. The uncapped Maro Itoje and Josh Beaumont have been retained in a 25-man squad for the Italian job, with Jack Clifford and Mako Vunipola also pushing hard. With 15 forwards named, Jones could possibly opt for a 6:2 bench split; either way, the 21-year-old Itoje and Beaumont, 22, are edging ever closer to senior debuts. Elliot Daly and Matt Kvesic, however, have been released back to their clubs, leaving Jones looking for an improved display against opponents who ran France close in Paris last Saturday. \u201cWe were happy to have won on Saturday but we certainly weren\u2019t happy with our performance,\u201d said Jones. \u201cWe\u2019ll pick a side specifically for Italy \u2026 it won\u2019t be dissimilar to Scotland but the batting order might change.\u201d He is also promising England \u201cwill be a fitter side than we are now\u201d by the end of the Six Nations. \u201cI\u2019m not saying we are unfit at the moment but there are periods of time in the game when we haven\u2019t got the concentration and the application to do what we want to do,\u201d said the Australian. \u201cThere is specific fitness for rugby and the only way you get that is to train specifically for rugby. You don\u2019t get it through doing other things. \u201cThe players are fit enough to play in the Six Nations but we definitely won\u2019t be fit enough to play in Australia on hard tracks. We will pick that up through training and by the end of the Six Nations we will be in pretty good fettle. The hope is the players understand where they need to be at for international rugby and will continue to do that with their clubs. We will then top them up for the Australian tour.\u201d Jones declined to elaborate on whether he felt England had got their pre-World Cup conditioning wrong but wants to see more attacking intent from his side in Rome. \u201cThe sun could be shining, they will be selling paninis outside the ground, everyone will be happy and we have a referee that likes attacking rugby. It could be a good occasion. If we play well, we\u2019ll score points. If we play really, really well we\u2019ll score a lot of points. Obviously Italy are part of the equation but that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
