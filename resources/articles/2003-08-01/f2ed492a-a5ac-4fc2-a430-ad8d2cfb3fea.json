Their fallibility in that department was plain for all to see in their 3-3 draw at home to Cheltenham Town . It was hard to believe that Cheltenham had not collected any points from their two previous matches and scored only three goals. On this occasion, they came from behind to lead 3-1, all their goals coming from Damian Spencer. His last two came in the space of 60 seconds just before half-time - not bad for a player who has not found the net very often since joining Cheltenham on a free transfer from Bristol City 12 months ago. Fortunately for Hull, Cheltenham have hardly looked solid in defence either and the home team were able to draw level through strikes by Jason Price and Danny Allsopp. Still, one consolation for Cheltenham (and especially Spencer) concerns the influence that Bob Taylor is likely to have on the team when he is fully match fit. The 36-year-old striker was recently signed from West Bromwich Albion and Cheltenham manager Bobby Gould said: 'Sometimes, players learn more from other players than they do from the teachers - the coaches and managers - and that's where Bob comes in.' The only teams with 100 per cent records in this division are Swansea City (who beat Boston United 3-0 on Friday) and York City , who followed their lead with a 1-0 win at Huddersfield Town . York's star was Lee Bullock, who scored the decisive goal with a tremendous long-range shot. Carlisle United 's miserable start to the season continued when they sank to a 2-0 home defeat by Bristol Rovers . Ironically, both goals came from Wayne Carlisle."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
