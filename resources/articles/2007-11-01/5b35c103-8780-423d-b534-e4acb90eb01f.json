The Scottish education secretary, Fiona Hyslop, said yesterday she shared the fears of universities such as Edinburgh, Glasgow and St Andrews that their English counterparts - chiefly Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial, the London School of Economics and Manchester - may soon be allowed to charge much higher top-up fees, and outstrip spending by other universities. In an interview with the Guardian, Hyslop revealed she is to set up a review with university principals of the future of Scotland's universities to help them find extra sources of income after 2010, when education ministers in England are expected to raise the current \u00a33,000 ceiling on tuition fees. University and student leaders in Scotland are furious about the lower than expected funding settlement announced in Wednesday's Scottish budget, and the decision to scrap entirely an election pledge to write off all student debts. Student leaders accused the Scottish National party administration of betraying SNP voters at the May election. The umbrella body Universities Scotland said next year's deal was a real-terms cut which would force some colleges to cut spending and freeze student numbers. Overall, universities had been given \u00a3168m less than they had wanted, widening a narrow gap in funding compared with English universities. Muir Russell, the principal at Glasgow University and convener of Universities Scotland, called on Wednesday night for \"urgent\" talks with ministers about the future of funding after a \"disappointing\" budget. \"We are concerned that it may weaken our competitive position relative to universities in England,\" he warned. Hyslop said: \"The issue is where will the university sector be post-2010. What can government do to mobilise and help support these institutions?\" The solution was a \"future thinking\" review to investigate new funding measures for the next decade. The SNP executive has been under intense pressure to review university funding. Introducing tuition fees in Scotland has been ruled out as politically undeliverable. They give English universities an extra \u00a31.5bn a year - roughly equivalent to \u00a3150m a year in Scotland, where universities spend \u00a31.9bn a year in total. The Russell group of 18 elite universities is pressing hard for the \u00a33,000 cap to rise. Scottish principals fear it could increase to \u00a35,000 or even be abolished for some universities after 2010. However, there are doubts the Treasury will agree to raise the cap on tuition fees, since the exchequer would have to pay them up front until students began repaying them after graduation. The SNP leader, Alex Salmond, was named parliamentarian of the year by the Spectator magazine yesterday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
