He records the sweet sorrow of their departure, his yearning for his homeland and the writing life waiting for him there. He sketched, over the next few weeks, the entire plan of the novel. Fugard made notes on his major characters and his setting of Sophiatown, the black township which the authorities had destroyed in the late 1950s to make way for homes for whites. One of the scenes he alludes to, the \"confrontation with the priest in the church\", was later edited out of the published novel. Fugard continued writing notes after he disembarked in Cape Town, and then in Port Elizabeth, where he was staying with his parents and his sister Glenda. His impressions of the country he hadn't seen for a year became inseparable from the book he was writing. The man with shrivelled legs, wearing an umbrella on his head, whom he saw in his mother's caf\u00e9, was transformed for instance into Morris Tshabalala, whose life Tsotsi spares in the novel. His last note about Tsotsi dates from January 1961. The book remained unpublished until 1980. This week the film, directed by Gavin Hogg with a cast of non-professional actors, won the Oscar for best foreign langauge film. December 1960: Departure from Southampton to the Cape The ship's brass-band playing patriotic British music. Nostalgia and a flood of sentiment. Sheila in tears - myself too, but suppressed. Indulged this mood, savoured the bittersweet of our leaving. The last tug that had followed us to the harbour was turning away, our ship was slipping, alone, into the ocean. Gulls, black and sinister, hung overhead, like spiders waiting in the web of spars and cables. The lights, remote now. The sea, cold and quick. A strong wind tearing down one side of the ship. A pale full moon, sailing abreast of us through storm clouds. The moment was charged with an ominous presentiment of a dark future - and we were sailing to the Cape and sunshine! The evening on deck. Biting cold. Wind and spray. I let the wind into my hair and through my nostrils and mouth into the furthermost crannies of my skull. Gone were the cobwebs of Europe and the past 12 months. I felt awakened - renewed - in life I again see the dimension, the big dimension. The \"big conception\" of my youth. The spars were singing. God! How could I forget so much. Life is big, its possibilities infinite. Joburg to Orlando train. Tsotsis. Bicycle spoke - death. The idea for a story - criminal: completely shrouded in darkness. At a moment - a stab of light and pain. This followed, developed, in the span of a short time leads to the full Christian experience after a meeting with a priest in an empty church. The end - a life saved. (A useless life saved? Old man?) Held and refusing to let go. Carried, cherished - dying with it? Love. His dark shroud expressed in nihilism, anarchy. Hate. \"Nothing is precious. Nothing is worth keeping. Destruction.\" And then to find something precious. Shoebox baby. Beauty to be effaced or made ugly. Fear of the unknown. In beauty a mystery that stirs and moves him - this is the danger. And hence, the violence. Confrontation with the priest in the church. Knife in one hand, he pulls down and desecrates a crucifix. There is anger and fury, a sense of impotence against the change taking place. The priest immobile at the altar - the enigma. Beauty - an old face, leaves in the mud, the dust flying off a mine dump, laughter, tears. His fear of being \"moved\" - a realisation. The kennel in the backyard where he hides from the police. The yellow bitch, rat-faced, gives birth to her pups a few feet from his face. He can't move, chases her away. He must watch. Madondo was his name - a long time ago. A name dimly remembered. Finally, the value - life = love is found and clung to, guarded, cherished (the old man). After all the doubt. Uncertainty = unknown. Maybe? Why? Why not? Cape Town: Landed just before Christmas. Sea Point - 11 pm. Cool clear night, the crowds withdrawn to the caf\u00e9s and their flats. Walk along the beach front, passing the children's playground. Four coloured nursemaids on the swings, singing. Large African woman on the roundabout, turning and turning around, around. She sat quite still, a disconsolate figure in a maid's white apron and cap. Story (contd) - The kid is leader of a gang. Four members including him. The \"change\" as a positive force, outside of himself. Resisted. One of the members and the victim - chosen because he knew with unfailing accuracy where the heart was - his bicycle spoke never missed. The puppies born dead. Life ugly. Hiding as a young boy from the police. Someone kicked the yellow chained-up bitch, it crawled as far as it could go, towards him in the shelter, then lay down and gave birth to death. No one came to remove them because everyone was taken away in the removals, and he didn't dare leave because through the day he heard the harsh voices of policemen. The baby in the shoebox: it was small, and black, and older than anything he had ever seen in his life. Its face, lined and wrinkled. Left by a young girl, in a shoebox in the ruined house where he had crawled, wounded. The first night it rained - summer thunderstorm. So they had water and that kept them alive until the next day. Sequence: (1) Killing on train. (2) Shebeen - gang fight or police. (3) Ruin - baby and the memory = light. Looking for milk for the baby: \"Mama, have you any milk?\" Takes her back and forces her to feed the child. Sophiatown - ruin of one of the buildings. In the end, rushing to save the child as the bulldozer moves in. The wall collap-ses on both. Or alive? - the kid crying. He got there with a few seconds to spare. But they were few. Time only, as the first crack snaked along the wall and then bulged, time only to throw himself on all fours over the child, so that he took the first weight of falling brick, before he was flattened out, smothering them both. Christmas eve - on the road from Cape Town - at the Riversdale Petrol Station a truckload of coloured trippers going to Port Elizabeth and a few coloured musicians from the location and the odd carload of whites passing late along the road, all at the caf\u00e9. Carols and Boere-musiek and \"Heppy- heppy!\" \"We're all the same, hey!\" and a lot of other Christmas sentiments. It was 1am. This same petrol station about five years ago when I was waiting, late at night, for a lift. Moths - thousands of them - around the lamp in the room where I sat with the night attendant. Veld sound - pebbles rubbed together - a small, clean, rounded sound. Pre-dawn at Knysna. The cocks crowing, calling and answering each other in all quarters of the town. Breeze from the sea moving through the big oaks in the main street. Stars reflected on wet corrugated iron roofs. Dawn on the road. First it was a black silhouette having no depth, running beside us, unfolding and changing as shapes loomed, humped against the paling sky. At a moment there was depth and difference - the cold shapes that lie between black and smoke-grey, and the depth of the koppie unhurried on the horizon and the impatience of tree and house and rock and river, rushing past. Then, taking a bend in the road, facing east now, light and colour, the sore red of the soil where the road had cut through the groin of a hill. Port Elizabeth: Back in the Bird Street flat. Dependence - Dad. Nothing left in his life - the limits of it shrunk to his corporeal possession of the world. Twenty-four hours a day of nothing. With his cards, playing patience. Glenda: \"You play patience a lot, don't you, Dad!\" Dad: \"Yes. Anything to pass the time, darling. Anything at all.\" Dependence. Relationship with my mother. Hate-Love. Where is my life? What is left - tell me. What is left? And myself, charming away the pain, the truth of the pain, the impatience, the revolt, with words, mouthing clich\u00e9s about \"You've got so far\" etc, \"right thinking\", \"courage\". Hiding from the fact, the reality behind verbiage. Story (contd) - The Kid. Boston - clever and a coward - he could read. Die Aap - strength. Butcher - sadist. Cripple in Mom's caf\u00e9 in St George's Park - twisted, shrivelled legs. Pulled himself along by his hands - wearing leather gloves. On his head an umbrella - small, two-foot diameter - attached by a circle of thin metal rods to a band round his forehead. Earns his living pulling out weeds in the park nursery. January 1961 Story (contd) - The reality of what you recognise and admit to exist. Conscious = present - drifting impulse, motive and purpose. Sub-conscious deeper morality. The even darker regions where the images live. Tsotsi - progression is an admission of an ever deeper dimension to his living. Tsotsi - a freedom (1) to choose his victim. (2) Not to have a victim. \u00b7 Tsotsi is on general release from March 17"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
