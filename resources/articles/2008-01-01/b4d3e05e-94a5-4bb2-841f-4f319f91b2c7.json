The Cambridge Pre-U is intended to help top-scoring candidates trump their A-level rivals in the rush for the most competitive university places by teaching them traditional exam and study skills over modern coursework-based learning. State school headteachers are warning that it will prove divisive as the government encourages schools to move towards more vocational diplomas. Independent schools and some state schools are preparing to adopt the Cambridge Pre-U qualification from September in anticipation of it getting the go-ahead from the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) in the next few months. University of Cambridge International Examinations - a subsidiary of the Cambridge Assessment Group, which is part of the University of Cambridge - has designed the course. Students do three subjects plus an extended essay and training in study skills. Dr Kevin Stannard, director of curriculum development, said: \"We are confident of swift accreditation, a necessary step in giving maintained schools the opportunity to adopt Cambridge Pre-U for first teaching in the coming academic year.\" The QCA said it was evaluating the qualification but could not discuss details. Graham Able, master of Dulwich college, said: \"We are adopting the Pre-U in classics and history of art from September and all students will sit a central research course and do an extended essay under the Cambridge syllabus. We will keep a watching eye over the next few years and consider a wholesale move as things develop.\" John Dunford, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the new qualification would create an unnecessary divide. \"A-levels are being reformed and there is no necessity for some schools to look back to some golden age of qualifications which is no longer appropriate,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
