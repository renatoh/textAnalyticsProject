Cricket comes to mind but Faldo's comments do seem to have been the talk of the locker room here in the lead-up to this 136th Open Championship. And, it must be said, not many players - young or old - were lining up to support him. After completing an opening round of 72, England's Paul Casey, who will turn 30 on Saturday, was giving little room to the notion that he has to dislike his opponents to beat them. Which is not surprising for a man who found himself in bother when he declared that he \"properly hated\" the Americans during the Ryder Cup. \"The friendship obviously works well in team matches,\" said Casey. \"But I know a lot of the guys who are friendly when they want to be friendly but can still be extreme competitors. I mean, Geoff Ogilvy is a good pal of mine and I took a lot from his US Open win last year. It hasn't paid off yet, but I've watched and learned. I think I'm as good as him. I don't go around saying it, but I think it a lot.\" The Australian, 30 last month, agrees with his friend. \"If I'm coming up the last hole against Adam Scott, who is my closest mate on tour, I want to beat him more,\" Ogilvy said after a disappointing 75. \"You don't have to hate people to want to beat them. Some may need that feeling, but it is far from universally true.\" One European who has come close to winning a major title more than once in the last five years, Thomas Bjorn, has his own view on why he and so many of his co-continentals have failed at the very highest level. \"Things have changed over the years,\" the Dane maintained after \"working hard\" for an opening 70. \"One of the biggest differences between now and the mid-80s is that we travel so much more. The competition is so much deeper, more guys can win now. And when you travel as much as we do, you want to have friends around you. With a 12-month schedule you need that sort of support group to survive.\" Paul Lawrie, the Brit who won the Open on its last visit to Carnoustie in 1999, agrees, insisting that the fact there are \"plenty of nice guys out there who have won majors\" shows that Faldo's method is not the only path to success. \"Nick did it his way and won six of them, so it worked for him. But I'm not sure it is for everyone,\" Lawrie claimed on completing his opening 73 with a 40ft putt for birdie across the 18th green. \"Besides, I think there are a few reasons why the younger lads have yet to break through in the majors. If there was only one they would have identified it by now.\" Still, it is easy to identify perhaps the biggest reason behind Faldo's concern for the continuing inability of the game's leading youngsters to win at the highest level. His name is Tiger Woods. \"I think Nick may have formed a different opinion had he played at the time of Tiger,\" says the agent Andrew \"Chubby\"' Chandler, whose clients are a famously close-knit group. \"I'm not sure he'd have won six majors playing against Tiger. \"While being friends is not a problem, it is true that the younger lads today make a lot of money fairly easily. The commercial world has cottoned on to golf and the players are benefiting hugely. Besides, I'm not sure that many guys in any sport would find it as easy to be as single-minded as Nick was. In fact, I'd like him to explain how he didn't get in his own way to an extent.\" Faldo, living up to the grumpy image that alienated colleagues during his career, was not prepared to do so yesterday. Well, he had just shot 79, a day after turning 50. His verdict? \"I didn't enjoy that at all.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
