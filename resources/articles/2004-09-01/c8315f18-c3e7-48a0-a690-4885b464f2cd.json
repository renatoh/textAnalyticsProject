Highway authorities are simply responding to a demand. We buy ever more high-performance and 4x4 vehicles, we travel ever further to work and for our leisure activities, we thunder through other people's quiet lanes and villages, and then we complain to the council because nothing is being done to stop it. Having worked for 30 years managing roads and traffic in Oxfordshire, hardly a day goes by without someone complaining, \"do we have to wait for someone to be killed before the council does something about the traffic?\". But what to do? The police are busy chasing criminals and the vociferous car lobby has put the government on the back foot on speed cameras. So we put up ever more signs. Colin Carritt Area engineer, Oxfordshire county council I read with interest that over-zealous highway authorities are ruining the character of country roads by insisting on too many safety signs. By way of contrast, what has always amazed me about Britain's motorways, when compared with their continental counterparts, is how few signs are in evidence which remind motorists to observe the speed limit. Why is this? Paul Tattam Teignmouth, Devon Mark MacArthur-Christie of the Association of British Drivers (Letters, August 27) asks why nearly 100 more people died on our roads in 2003 than in 1998 and then blames a misguided emphasis on speed limits and speed limit enforcement. According to official statistics, 87 more people were killed on our roads in 2003 than in 1998, an increase of 2.54%. In that period road deaths have fallen for all categories of road users except two - car occupants and motorcyclists. Deaths of car occupants increased by 4% while those of motorcyclists and their passengers increased by 40%; 195 more motorcyclists died in 2003 than in 1998. On the accepted measure of exposure miles driven, motorcyclists are 30 times more likely to be killed than car occupants. Why? The annual report on speeding, Vehicle Speeds in Great Britain, shows that motorcyclists are the most dedicated speeders, on all classes of road. The only problem with the emphasis on speed limits is that, so far, motorcyclists can too easily evade enforcement. And, of course, many of our limits are too high to encourage appropriate speed choice. Paige Mitchell The Slower Speeds Initiative Fatalities have fallen at most camera sites. But their benefit would have been even greater if it were not for the number of drivers who still insist on speeding past them (as the number of tickets issued shows). That overall casualty rates have risen is largely because the move to high-visibility cameras has encouraged motorists to \"put their foot down\" anywhere there isn't a big yellow box by the side of the road, confident that they are unlikely to be caught. The only solution is a return to the widespread use of covert speed enforcement. Increasing levels of traffic policing should be a major government priority. It is madness to argue that motorists should be entrusted to drive at whatever speed they think fit when every day drivers seem intent on proving how generally irresponsible they are. For as long as motorists insist on using mobile phones, driving when under the influence of drink or drugs, or when too tired to be safe, speed enforcement must continue to play a central role in improving road safety.
