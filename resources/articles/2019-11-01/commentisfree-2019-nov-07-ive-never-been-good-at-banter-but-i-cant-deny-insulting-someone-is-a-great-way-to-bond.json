If you are, you know my type: when a group full of friends is playfully teasing each other, I\u2019m the one laughing a little bit too loudly, eyes brimming with tears. Maybe it\u2019s my over-sensitivity, or the fact I spent my childhood in Canada, where I never noticed these dynamics (compared to Australia, where my Aussie relatives would regularly take the piss out of me while my face flushed), but I\u2019ve always been bad at it. Growing up, I never understood it. I\u2019m not the only one, either, a recent study showed that 48% of Australian students felt harmed by verbal \u201cjokes\u201d (also referred to as \u201cpeer aggression\u201d). Conversely, these comments were experienced by others but dismissed as \u201cfun, joking around or banter\u201d. So when does banter become bullying? Unsurprisingly, there is no clear line. The word \u201cbanter\u201d is tossed around on dating profiles as a desirable trait and crops up everywhere from friendship groups to sporting teams. Earlier this year, Australian cricket captain Justin Langer said \u201cIf I play Uno with my daughter there\u2019s lots of banter. We sort of sledge each other but we don\u2019t abuse each other.\u201d A father and daughter teasing one another over a card game is fun. In a workplace, of course, things become murkier. And nobody wants to be a buzzkill. Lawyer and manager of a commercial law firm Lisa Klug alludes to the grey area of joking in the workplace, saying intention is irrelevant if someone is deemed to have been bullied. She notes the Australian guidelines in each state that highlight when behaviour becomes bullying (some examples of behaviours crossing the line include pranks, humiliation through sarcasm, cruel nicknames, teasing). Sledging, ribbing, teasing \u2013 these are all subjective terms. And while it may be slightly more black and white in a workplace, it\u2019s still murky. One person\u2019s banter is another person\u2019s bullying. As adults, we hopefully become aware of the difference between a social and professional environment. But when you\u2019re a kid at school, that\u2019s years away, and the school ground is your entire world. How can teenagers \u2013 or super sensitive people like me \u2013 navigate this dynamic? I threw a few questions to writer and comedian James Colley to get the viewpoint of a Professional Funny Man (\u2122). James agreed that it\u2019s not easy to draw a line between shitty comments and \u201cmucking around\u201d, but \u201cjust because it isn\u2019t easy doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not important,\u201d he told me. From a stand-up\u2019s point of view, \u201ca good comedian in any sense can read their audience and if the bit you are doing is purely for your own joy and not for theirs then it\u2019s no longer a good bit.\u201d For non-professionals, if this kind of communication doesn\u2019t come naturally, like anything \u2013 practice makes perfect. James tells me his humour came from being a defence mechanism (hard same). \u201cLearning the difference between a good laugh and a bad laugh takes time and it takes self-reflection. I wouldn\u2019t be where I am today were I not standing on a pile of regret.\u201d Cheers to that! Despite my fragile skin, I can\u2019t deny that playfully insulting \u2013 or being insulted by \u2013 someone is a great way to bond. When done correctly, it\u2019s fun I finally understand banter \u2026 13 years after graduating high school I recently realised my friends at work were my friends when we could take the piss out of one another. It\u2019s the sort of conversation I couldn\u2019t transpose verbatim because it would make us look barbaric. I started to, but nothing ruins a joke faster than earnest analysis, and besides \u2013 who has the word count to explain why someone dry-retching when I mention I\u2019m bisexual is so funny? Maybe growing up is part of it, not necessarily ageing, but reaching a stage where you know who you are and can therefore take yourself less seriously. I\u2019m no longer insecure about my sexuality, so can joke about it. Perhaps for some lucky young people they reach this stage of self-discovery at school, for others (like me) it\u2019s a lot later. Enjoying banter doesn\u2019t mean everything is a joke, either. We all know the feeling of someone dismissing an offensive remark as \u201chaving a laugh\u201d \u2013 to summarise, it sucks. Whether it\u2019s a stand-up\u2019s punchline or friend\u2019s off-hand comment, these things can hurt. Ultimately, there are a few things at play Empathy, sense of self, context. Reading cues from other people and knowing when to apologise are key components to being a decent human. All these concepts are generally easier to navigate within friendships \u2013 is this why banter works so well with mates? James agrees that familiarity is part of what makes good banter good, but that it doesn\u2019t all boil down to friendship. \u201cFamiliarity helps, for sure. There\u2019s an element of \u2018woah, we don\u2019t know each other like that\u2019 when it\u2019s a stranger. I think what\u2019s most important is that it\u2019s fun for both parties.\u201d And if you\u2019re the only one laughing ... \u201cWhen it\u2019s one-sided, I don\u2019t think it is banter. It may disguise itself as such but it\u2019s destructive.\u201d \u2022 Deirdre Fidge is a writer whose work has appeared on ABC News, SBS, the Sydney Morning Herald, Frankie magazine and television\u2019s Get Krackin\u2019"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
