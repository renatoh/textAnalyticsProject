The line making the biggest splash so far is Palin's remark that it would \"perhaps\" be necessary for the US to go to war with Russia if Georgia joined Nato and Russia invaded Georgia. On her experience, or lack of it GIBSON: Have you ever met a foreign head of state? PALIN: I have not and I think if you go back in history and if you ask that question of many vice presidents, they may have the same answer that I just gave you. But, Charlie, again, we've got to remember what the desire is in this nation at this time. It is for no more politics as usual and somebody's big, fat resume maybe that shows decades and decades in that Washington establishment, where, yes, they've had opportunities to meet heads of state. On God and war GIBSON: You said recently, in your old church, \"Our national leaders are sending U.S. soldiers on a task that is from God.\" Are we fighting a holy war? PALIN: You know, I don't know if that was my exact quote. GIBSON: Exact words. PALIN: But the reference there is a repeat of Abraham Lincoln's words when he said -- first, he suggested never presume to know what God's will is, and I would never presume to know God's will or to speak God's words [...] GIBSON: But then are you sending your son on a task that is from God? PALIN: I don't know if the task is from God, Charlie."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
