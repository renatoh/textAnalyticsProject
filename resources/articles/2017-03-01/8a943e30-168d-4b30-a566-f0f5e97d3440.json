In an interview with Radio National on Friday, the treasurer also signalled that the government would cut or redirect funds from the $1.3bn-a-year national affordable housing agreement, saying he was \u201cvery frustrated\u201d with its performance. Under the bond aggregator model, the commonwealth would raise up to $200m through government bonds, which could be used to give loans to community housing providers or the private sector to provide social or affordable housing. On Friday Morrison announced a new affordable housing taskforce to develop the bond aggregator model, to be led by the former chief executive of the New South Wales Treasury Corporation Stephen Knight, and including the Treasury secretary, John Fraser, and the chief executive of the Community Housing Industry Association, Peta Winzar. The taskforce will report by mid year. On Radio National Morrison said the model worked overseas to help make new developments commercially viable \u2013 including in the UK, where he studied the scheme on a visit in January. Morrison said the proposal would help \u201cthe growing number of people on low incomes who are facing rental stress\u201d. The treasurer said an affordable housing finance corporation would be \u201cnot the whole solution, but it has certainly been part of the solution in many parts of the world\u201d, suggesting it will form one plank of the government\u2019s housing package in the May budget. Asked if the proposal would benefit only renters, Morrison said \u201cthere are models to enable [people] to eventually buy the houses in the circumstances\u201d, suggesting a rent-to-buy scheme was also under consideration. The chief executive of the NSW Federation of Housing Associations, Wendy Hayhurst, welcomed the announcement, saying that attracting large scale institutional investment would be \u201ccritical to establishing the community housing sector as a third tier of the Australian housing market\u201d. The Greens housing spokeswoman Lee Rhiannon labelled the plan a \u201cweak\u201d version of its policy to issue $2bn worth of loans through an affordable housing corporation. Morrison said he was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d with the performance of the national affordability agreement, which has cost the federal government $9bn so far. \u201cI\u2019m frustrated with it because we spent all of that money and the number of people on housing waiting lists has gone up and the number of houses owned in public housing has gone down and the number in rental stress on low incomes has gone up \u2013 so [it was] $9bn very badly spent.\u201d Homelessness services have warned that ending the $1.3bn a year agreement for public housing and homelessness services would be an \u201cunmitigated disaster\u201d for those sleeping rough, effectively cutting two-thirds of funding from specialist homelessness services. Asked if the $1.3bn would be redirected to an affordable housing finance corporation, Morrison noted the bond program was an \u201coff-balance sheet\u201d arrangement, meaning it would not add to government debt in the budget. Morrison said the government\u2019s plan was \u201cnot necessarily\u201d about reducing the national affordable housing agreement, but the funds had to be spent better. Morrison equivocated on whether the funds would be cut, promising only that the government would spend the money better but \u201cultimate decisions \u2026 will have to be taken in the context of the challenges that we have more broadly in the budget\u201d. Rhiannon said the bond aggregator should not be an excuse to abolish direct funding through a national agreement. \u201cThe national affordable housing agreement should be reformed and complement the aggregator if the government is serious about housing affordability and security.\u201d Asked about comments by UniSuper\u2019s chief executive, Chris Cuffe, that there was \u201cno justification\u201d for capital gains tax discounts on properties that were resold after just a year, Morrison said the average investment property was held for eight and a half years, and the discount was introduced \u201cto simplify tax arrangements in a high interest high inflation environment\u201d. Morrison said he \u201cdidn\u2019t necessarily agree\u201d with case-by-case reductions to the capital gains tax discount because the current discount was simpler for taxpayers and the tax office. He did not rule out any changes to capital gains tax in the budget. Morrison said a report on the ABC\u2019s 7.30 on Thursday that Malcolm Turnbull would take the lead on economic issues did not mean he had been sidelined, because \u201cthe prime minister is always the chief economic spokesperson\u201d of the government. \u201cAlways has been, always should be \u2013 the prime minister is leading the country and there is no greater challenge than continuing the prosperity we\u2019ve enjoyed for the last 26 years.\u201d Morrison said he and the prime minister were \u201ca team\u201d and worked on the budget together. The 7.30 report also suggested Turnbull would conduct a reshuffle after the budget, with attorney general George Brandis to move on either to become high commissioner in London or to another prominent position. Brandis is likely to be replaced by the social services minister, Christian Porter, or the employment minister, Michaelia Cash, it said. His position as government leader in the Senate is expected to go to the finance minister, Mathias Cormann."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
