For Rosemary McKinney, an epilepsy and arthritis sufferer in her early 60s, the effect has been nothing short of revolutionary. Fifteen years ago, McKinney was a busy mother of three with a career in the civil service. Then epilepsy struck. Such was her fear of suffering a seizure in public that she stopped going out. Her condition was compounded by the onset of arthritis and she remained housebound for five years before coming to the attention of a social worker. \"She asked me if I would go to this Island Resource Centre and she was so nice that I didn't like to refuse her,\" McKinney recalls, \"so I went along one day a week and I hated it! After being in the house for five years it seemed very noisy - even the cutlery at lunchtime seemed so loud. I'd got into a rut and it was a big change.\" Ten years on, though, her confidence has grown to the extent that she is now secretary of the centre's committee and has applied successfully for a \u00a36,000 millennium grant to take a group of 30 disabled people on a short break to the seaside. The work on setting standards began in 1997, when community care services manager Lesley McDowell and her colleague, Helen Lewis, set about drawing up quality standards for their team to work to. In response to increasing evidence of disabled people's reluctance to participate in projects designed by able-bodied people who have failed to involve them, McDowell and Lewis took the route of consulting service users about the design of standards. McKinney was one of a small number of users chosen to form a consultation group providing feedback on services. When the process broadened out to include a wider range of disabled people, McKinney became a facilitator, travelling to different day centres to gauge the views of other service-users. \"The powers that be thought that they'd talk more openly to someone else who was a user,\" she says. \"And do you know, I had a lovely time. I really enjoyed meeting the people and talking to them. I enjoyed it so much that that got me involved in other things.\" One of her findings was that many service-users, particularly those with a newly-acquired disability, needed more chance to talk through their feelings of shock and anguish in order to come to terms with their condition. Since social workers with heavy caseloads had little time to spend with them, it was decided that McKinney and four others should be trained as \"befrienders\". This will have an added advantage in that service-users will be talking to someone who has been through the experience and can be counted on to have a real understanding of their situation. The brief of the South and East Belfast physical health and disability team is to provide psychological and social support to people with a disability. The team's commitment to feedback from users has enabled disabled people to air concerns about the services they receive without fear of offending staff or or losing the service. It has also greatly enhanced the staff's understanding of the expectations and priorities of users and has helped in communication by creating a more equal relationship between service user and provider. Perhaps most important for the disabled people, the process has been empowering - returning to them a sense of control and greatly increasing self-esteem. What began as a daunting process for staff with heavy caseloads, and no down time, has become a success story which has ultimately boosted morale for both staff and users. McDowell recalls: \"When the idea was first introduced, the reaction was: why are we doing this? We are extremely busy, this is more work and what value is it going to add? We know that we are practising well; we have clients telling us all the time how much they value our service; why are you doubting our practice?\" Yet, in an area where excellence is notoriously hard to quantify, the establishment of benchmarks has, McDowell believes, given staff concrete evidence of the quality of their practice as well as providing a much clearer definition of their role. The exercise has also streamlined caseloads through more accurate targeting of services and the creation of a new post of senior social work practitioner with a small caseload and a remit to provide supervision, guidance and work on service development. The fusion of health and social services in Northern Ireland, with its four regional health and social services boards, has meant that the team has been able to work closely with district nursing and other medical staff. It has also begun to develop a person-centred information system where client records can be shared. When the team was awarded a chartermark last September, staff morale reached an all-time high. \"The feedback we have from staff indicates that they are much clearer about what they are doing, they are much more confident in their role and they are in a position to be very proud of the service they can offer,\" says McDowell. The project is one of a range of models of excellence to be discussed today at a quality and practice conference in Belfast, organised by the Guardian and the National Institute of Social Work and sponsored by the British Association of Social Workers. The event comes ahead of creation in October of the province's social care council, which will take over regulation of ultimately the entire social care workforce. Paul Martin, chief inspector of the Northern Ireland social services inspectorate, who is speaking at the conference, describes this as \"the most significant change we've had in social care for 30 years\". The council will also draw up a code of conduct and practice, which will be monitored by another new body, the commission for care services (similar to the embryonic commission in England). This body will take over from the four inspection units currently run by the four regional health and social services boards in regulating residential, nursing and children's homes, extending its remit to day care service and fostering and adoption services. Finally, the inspectorate is proposing a reform of social work training in recognition of the dramatic changes in social work in the province over the past eight years. A move towards graduate-level training is on the cards, with a minimum of three years' study plus a pre-registration work placement year. After three traumatic decades in Northern Ireland, in which acute hospitals in the province's integrated health and social services structure have soaked up the lion's share of resources, social care is hoping for a breathing space and a chance to evolve, develop and finally realise its potential. \"I think,\" says Martin, \"we have a unique opportunity to make a real positive difference to the future.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
