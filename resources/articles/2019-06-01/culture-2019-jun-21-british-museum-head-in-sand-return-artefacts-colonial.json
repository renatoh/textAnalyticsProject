The Senegalese economist Felwine Sarr and the French art historian B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Savoy, who were asked to write the report by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, after he said the return of artefacts would be a priority during his tenure, said the British Museum was not addressing the issue. \u201cThere\u2019s an expression in French, la politique de l\u2019autruche, which means something is in front of you and you say you can\u2019t see it, like an ostrich with its head in the sand,\u201d said Sarr. \u201cThey will have to respond and they can\u2019t hide themselves any longer on the issue.\u201d The 252-page report published in November 2018 made a series of recommendations, chief among them being that France should respond favourably and grant restitutions to African countries that request the return of objects taken during the colonial era. For Sarr and Savoy, the loan of items to African museums \u2013 proposed by the British Museum and other major European institutions in the case of the Benin bronzes, which were stolen during a punitive expedition in 1897 \u2013 is not sufficient. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough because in a loan the right of the property belongs to you,\u201d said Sarr. \u201cYou loan something that you own, it\u2019s your property. If you restitute there is a transfer of the property rights and the new holder of those rights can loan you the item.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a symbolic dimension around property rights,\u201d added Savoy. \u201cIf you can loan your objects you are respected in the museum world because you can impose your will and conditions. In the capitalist sphere being able to loan gives you power and it means you can impose your own rights.\u201d In response, a spokesperson for the British Museum said it welcomed a \u201ctransparent focus on the provenance of objects\u201d, adding that the museum agreed with the report\u2019s call for the establishment of \u201cnew and more equitable relationships between Europe and Africa\u201d. \u201cWe believe the strength of the collection is its breadth and depth which allows millions of visitors an understanding of the cultures of the world and how they interconnect \u2013 whether through trade, migration, conquest, or peaceful exchange,\u201d the spokesperson added. Since the release of the report African countries, including Ivory Coast, Senegal and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, have made formal requests for the return of artefacts, and European countries including France and Germany have committed to handing back objects. The Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam has opened talks with Sri Lanka and Indonesia and described the Netherlands\u2019 failure to return stolen artefacts as a \u201cdisgrace\u201d. The report, known colloquially as the Macron report, was described as radical by some in the art world upon its release, but the authors disagree. \u201cIt\u2019s not us who are radical; it\u2019s historical facts which are radical,\u201d said Savoy. \u201cThere was a taboo around this fact for many centuries in Europe, the fact that many major museums have collections based on plundering. There are always ruptures when you break a taboo.\u201d Savoy and Sarr travelled to Mali, Senegal, Cameroon and Benin and examined the works at the Mus\u00e9e du quai Branly, which holds nearly 80% of the African artworks contained in French public collections, and found more than half may have to be returned. The head of the museum, St\u00e9phane Martin, criticised the report, saying it sidelined museums in favour of specialists in historical reparations, and stained everything collected and bought during the colonial period with \u201cthe impurity of colonial crime\u201d. Savoy and Sarr reject the idea that clear evidence of the circumstances in which colonial-era items were acquired is difficult to find or ambiguous. \u201cIt\u2019s not an argument that works,\u201d said Sarr. \u201cThese items were stolen or given or taken during scientific missions.\u201d Savoy added: \u201cMost of these items arrived in Europe between the 19th and 20th centuries \u2013 from 1885 to 1930 \u2013 and these are times of great documentation. All of these expeditions are well documented. The issue is accessing them as museums have sat on this material \u2013 they have all the documents.\u201d Savoy and Sarr say in the report that \u201cto speak openly about restitution is to speak of justice, rebalancing, recognition, restoration and reparation. But above all, it is to pave the way for the establishment of new cultural relationships.\u201d For the academics that means stopping \u201cthe arrogance of Europeans\u201d and European institutions when dealing with Africa. \u201cThe new ethical relationship is probably the end of the arrogance of Europeans,\u201d said Savoy. \u201cA lot of arguments from Europe are based on the idea that Africans can\u2019t host their own heritage, they don\u2019t have museums, we have saved them etc. Changing this way of relating and this narrative is stepping away from a cultural arrogance.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
