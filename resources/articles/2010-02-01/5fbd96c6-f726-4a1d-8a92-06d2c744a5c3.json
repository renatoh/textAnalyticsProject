Van Raat gave the first performances in Utrecht and Amsterdam with the Netherlands Radio Chamber Philharmonic conducted by Otto Tausk, with very different works by Pascal Dusapin and Cornelis de Bondt. Though Bryars is a pianist, the gestation of the concerto has been protracted and, as the title hints, the result is not conventional. The scoring of the piece includes a male chorus (members of Cappella Amsterdam), and embedded in the half-hour single movement are settings of two sonnets by the Scottish poet Edwin Morgan, the first of which provides the title. Bryars isn't the first composer to make such a hybrid \u2013 Beethoven's Choral Fantasy is a precedent, along with Busoni's huge piano concerto, which enlists a chorus (also all-male) \u2013 but strangely, he hardly makes a feature of it. For the most part, the choral setting remains in the background while the piano and orchestra churn away over it, and is hard to decipher even when following the text; how the texts themselves relate to Bryars's music is never revealed either. It was often hard to work out who was accompanying whom, for all three elements are remarkable for their lack of striking musical ideas. Van Raat spent most of his time rippling away prettily enough over a featureless backdrop provided by the orchestra. It could be the soundtrack to a cheesy romantic movie or a TV shampoo ad. What it most notably lacks is any sense of the interaction between soloist, orchestra and the chorus that the word concerto implies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
