The French winger was instrumental in preserving Wigan's Premier League status and has been watched frequently by Liverpool, who are among several clubs interested in the 24-year-old. His former club, Newcastle United, had a \u00a312m bid rejected close to January's transfer deadline and are expected to make a renewed approach in the coming months. Mart\u00ednez, however, says he is under no financial pressure to sell coveted players such as N'Zogbia and Hugo Rodallega, who both have one year remaining on their contracts at the DW Stadium, and will countenance their departures only if it enabled their careers to progress among the European elite. The Wigan manager said: \"Charles has improved every year. He's scored 10 goals a season for the past two years and taken on more responsibility. He's been captain. I think he can take on more responsibility on the pitch and I still think he's got a role to play for Wigan Athletic. \"He knows I wouldn't stop him from playing in the Champions League. We cannot offer that and there are a few players here who fall into that category of being able to play in the Champions League. If a club comes in for Charles that is not in the Champions League, then I would say 'no'. If I don't see that the club can offer him a different football project than ours then we are not going to sell.\" Despite a modest transfer budget in Premier League terms, and the threat of losing two key players for nothing in 12 months' time, Mart\u00ednez says another season in the top flight has removed any pressure to sell this summer. \"We don't have much money to spend but we don't have to sell anyone and, for me, it is much more important that we keep the group together. Financially we can keep our players because we are in the strongest financial position we have been in. We are very healthy.\" The midfield duo James McCarthy and Mohamed Diame are also likely to attract interest this summer, with the latter reportedly a target for Valencia. \"That would not surprise me because he impressed a lot of people when he played in the second division in Spain [for Rayo Vallecano] and he has had two excellent seasons here,\" said his manager. \"But we hope to extend his contract rather than listen to offers for him.\" Mart\u00ednez also clarified confusion over McCarthy's non-appearance for the Republic of Ireland's Carling Nations Cup campaign. The Ireland manager, Giovanni Trapattoni, claimed one player, understood to be McCarthy, had not reported for duty or returned his calls. Wigan, however, say the midfielder sustained ankle ligament damage against Stoke City on Sunday and that they kept the Football Association of Ireland fully informed of his injury. \"He needed a scan after a challenge with Jermaine Pennant on Sunday,\" Mart\u00ednez said. \"And the scan revealed grade one ligament damage in his right ankle. We passed the report to the Republic of Ireland medical team and they are well, well aware. That is where James had an operation earlier this season and it is an area that is a bit of a concern. He is not available to play and he will need at least three or four weeks to recover.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
