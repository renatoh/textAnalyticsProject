Last week Prof Adrian Cheok, who advocates sex with robots, was made a member of the Order of Australia for \u201csignificant service to international education\u201d. Guardian Australia reported that Cheok has faced accusations of poor conduct towards his peers in the past. In 2017 he was accused in an open letter by organisers of an academic conference of using \u201caggressive, belittling\u201d language towards another professor. The Digital Games Research Association Australia chapter president, Brendan Keogh, says he intends to challenge Cheok\u2019s award because of his conduct on social media. \u201cHe\u2019s not a worthy recipient due to his track record of abusive behaviour towards other academics in his field,\u201d he said. Keogh cited the incident in 2017 where conference organisers issued a formal apology after Cheok made personal attacks on Twitter against academics who had raised ethical concerns about his research. Cheok also attracted controversy last year as an organiser of the international conference on advances in computer entertainment technology when he invited Steve Bannon, the former White House chief strategist and former executive chairman of the rightwing website Breitbart, to be a keynote speaker, the Chronicle of Higher Education reported. There were 1,374 nominations for the Queen\u2019s birthday awards and 993 were handed out in 2019. In 2015 there were 748 nominations and 519 awards. The Labor senator Kimberley Kitching has said she will ask officials from the governor general\u2019s office about the due diligence process at a Senate estimates hearing in Canberra. \u201cObviously there is heavy scrutiny of nominees to ensure they are deserving recipients,\u201d she said. \u201cIn this day and age it\u2019s necessary that scrutiny of nominees\u2019 social media accounts is also undertaken. You would assume this would be the case, but in this example it is unclear. We\u2019ll be seeking to have a full understanding of the processes that were undertaken at the next estimates.\u201d The Australian honours and awards secretariat sits underneath the governor general\u2019s office. It has 17 staff to research nominations and in the past five years the process has become more efficient after moving from paper to digital forms, a spokesman said. \u201cThe secretariat advises nominators that it takes between 18 and 24 months from receipt of a nomination to the announcement of an award, and this remains true,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile nominations are processed as quickly as possible this does not supersede the requirement to ensure that the [decision-making council] has as much relevant information as possible to inform a recommendation. This means that if further research or work is required on a nomination it will be held over to a subsequent meeting of the council.\u201d The Order of Australia Association, which promotes the awards and hosts networking events for recipients across the country, said the dramatic increase in nominations was due in part to more people being aware of the awards and a desire for more female recipients. Its national chairman, Barry Nunn, said Australians should have faith in the integrity of the honours system. He was reluctant to discuss Cheok\u2019s case, saying it was not the association\u2019s place to comment on whether someone should or should not have received an award. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter how good the system is there will always be irregularities,\u201d Nunn said. \u201cOccasionally somebody pops up and questions are asked \u2026 There will be a few that are questionable I guess in some people\u2019s minds. That\u2019s inevitable.\u201d Asked if he was a worthy winner of an Order of Australia, Cheok told the Guardian: \u201cYes. Absolutely. \u201cI was awarded an Order of Australia based on my work as a computer scientist and electrical engineer who has made world-pioneering inventions in augmented and virtual reality, AI, and robotics. \u201cWith the academic h-index of 45 I am ranked in the top 0.05% of all computer scientists in the world and leading in Australia.\u201d (The h-index measures the productivity and citation impact of an academic\u2019s publications). Cheok dismissed suggestions his award might be challenged. \u201cI expect nothing will happen because this is about creating a perception and getting an emotional public reaction rather than dealing in precise facts,\u201d he said. \u201cI also recognise the leftist media are keen to brainwash Australians to accept destructive ideologies that undermine the values that our country was founded upon, and that some of us cannot freely speak about without being labelled an incorrect term.\u201d He reiterated his support for freedom of speech and said the Order of Australia was not an award from North Korea. At the May federal election, Cheok got 868 votes in the lower house seat of Boothby in South Australia, running for Fraser Anning\u2019s Conservative National party. Cheok and Anning said they were setting up a graduate school which would teach \u201cTrumpism\u201d and \u201cBannonism\u201d. The website was set up about 6 June but Cheok and Anning said it was just a draft. There have been 45 awards withdrawn since 1975. The governor general can terminate awards if there is a conviction for a criminal offence under Australian or overseas laws, the awardee has \u201cbehaved or acted in a manner that has brought disrepute\u201d to the awards, information in the nomination was false or misleading, or if additional information comes to light."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
