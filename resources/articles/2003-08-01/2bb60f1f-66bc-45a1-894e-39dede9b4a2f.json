For a comparable torchlight, we have to go back to the 1957 Bank Rate Tribunal which laid bare the workings of the Bank of England and the Treasury. In terms of public fascination, the more obvious comparison is with the Profumo scandal in 1963, which likewise led to a suicide - of Stephen Ward, friend of prostitute Christine Keeler - which nearly brought down the Macmillan Government. Lord Denning's subsequent racy report gave an extraordinary backstairs view of the murky frontiers between Number 10, defence and intelligence. But the Profumo scandal had a farcical element, and never involved a serious intelligence danger. The investigation into the suicide of Dr Kelly is not only revealing a more profound tragedy: it is already providing a unique picture of how key British institutions react to a crisis, with the kind of evidence and documentation which rarely emerges laid out on www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk. Even at this early stage we begin to see them in a different light. And none of them will look quite the same again. The inquiry has even thrown some light on the most secretive citadel of all, the Ministry of Defence, which has always defied investigation. Even the Treasury, as one mandarin told me, regards it as a no-go area, because it is always protected by the Prime Minister. The MOD has always had specially tricky relationships with its thousands of scientists who resent its enforcement of secrecy and have a tiresome tendency to tell the truth. They do not enjoy the same security as the career civil servants, and it is easy to imagine how Dr Kelly, after being highly valued as a 'human archive' and honoured with a CMG, found himself in a 'black hole' in the Ministry, caught between different departments. And we have now seen how ruthlessly senior civil servants moved in when they became worried that Kelly was talking to journalists. The personnel director, Richard Hatfield, asked him 'who gave him authority to exercise his own judgment?', and warned of possible disciplinary action, just before he gave evidence to the parliamentary committee. His line manager in the Ministry, Bryan Wells, was quite unaware of Kelly's grievances, and his unhappiness about his exposure. Yet the Ministry did not altogether conform to its image as the cold operator, content to throw any dissident to the wolves. It was the Permanent Secretary Sir Kevin Tebbitt who urged that they should 'show some regard for the man himself. He has come forward voluntarily, is not used to being thrust into the public eye and is not on trial'. It was the Minister Geoff Hoon, backed by the Prime Minister, who insisted Kelly should give evidence to the parliamentary committee on foreign affairs and face fierce questioning under the full glare of TV cameras. It was inevitable that MI6, the ultimate bastion of secrecy, should face closer inspection in the run-up to the war in Iraq; for unlike most wars it was 'intelligence-led', requiring evidence from the secret service to justify it. The publication of the fateful dossier in September, under the imprimatur of the JIC, was an unprecedented departure which - it was already known - was opposed by many senior agents. But we now know from the Hutton inquiry that there were serious differences within the Defence Intelligence Service (DIS), which is even more shadowy than MI6. Two dissenting intelligence experts expressed their concern about the 'level of certainty' in the foreword and summary of the dossier. But once the dossier became part of government policy it had to appear unanimous, and the JIC approved the final draft. It was thus not surprising that MI6 should move quickly to prevent Dr Kelly spilling any more beans: and John Scarlett, the chairman of the JIC and most awesome of the intelligence chiefs, wrote formally to Sir David Omand at the Cabinet office - even though he worked just down the corridor - insisting Kelly should have a 'proper security-style interview' to thrash out his inconsistencies. Dr Kelly, like many others who had strayed into intelligence territory, became a casualty of the wars between spooks; and the whole battleground had become much more dangerous after Number 10 insisted on publishing intelligence reports to justify their political arguments for war. The extent of the Prime Minister's involvement will become much clearer this week, when Alastair Campbell and others give evidence. But already the fingerprints of Number 10 have been visible through Whitehall. They insisted on originally publishing the intelligence information; they insisted on Dr Kelly appearing before the select committee; and - perhaps their biggest mistake - on declaring war on the BBC. The relentless hostility to the BBC becomes clear in the succession of memos written by Alastair Campbell to Richard Sambrook, the director of BBC News, complaining largely about its anti-war, anti-Government attitudes in the coverage of Iraq. While many previous Prime Ministers, including Thatcher and Wilson, bombarded the BBC, there has been no equivalent to this relentless assault, which appeared to assume that the BBC should be subservient to government. And Campbell was determined to lead the attack with a personal profile, while presumably enjoying Tony Blair's backing. The BBC has often been attacked for its dominating corporate culture, the model for Orwell's 'Ministry of Truth'. In fact the evidence in the inquiry suggests vigorous differences of view and internal criticism: the producer of Today, Kevin Marsh, and the science reporter for Newsnight, Susan Watts, both distanced themselves from the defence correspondent Andrew Gilligan. And while the management tried to press Watts to corroborate Gilligan, she refused. The BBC's internal memos reveal a much more serious collective responsibility than most media. Today may have made a serious mistake in unleashing investigative reporters without proper supervision, who could also write for politicised tabloids. But Kevin Marsh realised the dangers and proposed banning these outlets, while wondering 'does this sound too harsh?' The responsibility of the governors and their chairman Gavyn Davies remains much more uncertain, judging from the minutes of their emergency meeting on 6 July. There were clear signs of unease about Gilligan's reporting, and the minutes record: 'There was suggestion that governors should not offer immediate support to the management.' There was also some support for commenting on BBC journalists writing for newspapers and 'creating rather than reporting the news'. But Davies appeared determined to show immediate public solidarity, and postponed an inquiry. The BBC emerges less damaged than other institutions, retaining its reputation as the fearless critic of all governments, which is the chief reason for its world-wide prestige. In his replies to Campbell's bombardment, Richard Sambrook at one point conceded that a report by Andrew Gilligan was 'unacceptable'; but in general he held his ground. The role of Parliament in the affair already looks much more questionable. In many respects the select committees have shown themselves more effective in the past few years, in interrogating officials and bureaucrats to make them more accountable. But they have also revealed their limitations, as they take turns to make party-political points without proper research, and without a special counsel, on the American pattern, to direct and co-ordinate their investigation. Whether the members of the select committee on foreign affairs hastened Dr Kelly's suicide with its brutal interrogation is too early to judge. But the skilful questioning of witnesses by Lord Hutton's counsel, James Dingamens, has already shown up how inadequate and ineffective were the MPs in extracting the truth. And it has needed a Law Lord, with all his authority and detachment, to open up the murky areas of government which MPs have failed to penetrate. For anyone interested in how British government really operates in times of crisis, Lord Hutton has already performed a valuable service. But his hearings raise the question of why such critical areas have remained so hidden, and so unaccountable. The most effective and lasting monument to Dr Kelly would be the reform of the parliamentary system, to ensure MPs can investigate seriously the abuses of executive power, before a national tragedy forces a judge to intervene with the full powers of his office. \u00b7 Anthony Sampson is writing a new version of his Anatomy of Britain.
