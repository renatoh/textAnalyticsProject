At a press conference to mark the arrival of Umunna, the former Labour MP who co-formed Change UK in February but abandoned the group just over a week ago, Cable said his party was talking to some of the five other MPs who left Change recently. But he declined to say how many of them could come. \u201cI\u2019m not quantifying it, but we are having conversations with the other independent MPs,\u201d the Lib Dem leader said. \u201cThey\u2019re making a decision based on their own personal circumstances, and in their own time, but it\u2019s clear that we share values and objectives with quite a few of them.\u201d Reports have suggested that two former Tories who co-formed then left Change UK, Sarah Wollaston and Heidi Allen, could follow Umunna, as well as remain-minded Conservatives such as Phillip Lee. Umunna insisted that his third party of 2019 would be his last \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m not intending to join any others\u201d \u2013 and refused to confirm whether he would seek to stand in his current Streatham constituency or another in the next general election. \u201cI\u2019m a Streatham boy, born and bred, and I\u2019m absolutely committed to my constituency,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been a member of this party for a day now, almost, and I think for me to start dictating what will happen in the future and pretending somehow that I shouldn\u2019t have to go through the usual processes like everyone else, would be the wrong thing.\u201d He denied having any immediate leadership ambitions, declining to endorse either Jo Swinson or Ed Davey, who are competing to succeed the departing Cable, as he had \u201conly just arrived\u201d. In a speech at the event, Umunna recalled his regular criticisms of the Lib Dems when they were in coalition with the Conservatives from 2010 to 2015 \u2013 he directly opposed Cable as shadow business secretary for much of it \u2013 but insisted his new party was now different. Umunna said the Lib Dems now accepted that policies such as the bedroom tax \u201cshould never have happened\u201d, and that the party should never have broken its pledge on university tuition fees. \u201cFour years on from this party\u2019s time in office, things have changed. The Liberal Democrats have voted against every single one of the Conservative party\u2019s budgets since 2015,\u201d he said. The split in Change UK \u2013 who are now formally called the Independent Group for Change following a lawsuit by the petitions website Change.org \u2013 saw Umunna leave to sit as an independent along with Allen and Wollaston and former Labour MPs Luciana Berger, Gavin Shuker and Angela Smith. Five MPs are still under the Change banner: the former Tory Anna Soubry and ex-Labour MPs Mike Gapes, Chris Leslie, Joan Ryan and Ann Coffey. Umunna said he would urge these five to follow him: \u201cThey\u2019re my friends, we went on a very difficult political journey together. They are good people who have the right values and put the national interest first. We just had difference in views on how you realise what it is you are trying to achieve.\u201d Umunna said he accepted his recent switches would prompt some mockery, but said he believed it was braver to act rather than, as some other MPs did, sit in a party they no longer agreed with. \u201cPrivately, they say, \u2018I agree with every single word you said.\u2019 And I\u2019m, \u2018Well, why are you sitting around and not doing anything about it?\u2019 The easy thing is to sit in your comfort zone in a party that you know is doing the wrong things, that has changed beyond belief, and not do anything about,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t regret making the decisions I\u2019ve made when l\u2019ve made them. This hasn\u2019t been about some sort of career, or becoming the leader.\u201d Questioned about his views, Umunna said he accepted that plenty of his former colleagues in Labour were not being complacent, but were seeking to change the party from within. However, he said, this was impossible. \u201cMy assessment is this: the Labour party is not the Labour party that I joined. It is a new and different party now. The leadership has been taken over by the hard left, but so has the NEC, so has the party machine. And it is no longer a broad church.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
