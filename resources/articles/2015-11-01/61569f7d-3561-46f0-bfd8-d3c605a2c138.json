The Chelsea manager has tried tactical tweaks \u2013 using him as a No10, where Hazard played when he was younger, rather than on or off the left side. It was what Hazard himself had suggested when he had a heart-to-heart with Mourinho before the Capital One Cup tie at Stoke City on 27 October and the move worked that night. Hazard was good, although he did miss the decisive kick in the penalty shootout as Chelsea went out of the competition. It has been a mixed bag for him since in the position. He was poor and hauled off on the hour in the home defeat against Liverpool four days later. Last weekend, when restored to the role, he was excellent in the vital win over Norwich City, also at Stamford Bridge. He was back on the left for the Champions League away victory against Maccabi Tel Aviv on Tuesday night. Mourinho appears to have made up his mind and, judging by his comments in advance of Sunday\u2019s derby visit to Tottenham Hotspur, it would be a surprise if Hazard was given further opportunity as a No10. Mourinho was asked to name his perfect No10 and he put forward two of them \u2013 Wesley Sneijder and Deco, with whom he worked at Internazionale and Porto, respectively. Mesut \u00d6zil, now of Arsenal, and his player at Real Madrid, was described as \u201cvery good\u201d. Sneijder and Deco, Mourinho agreed, were complete. They could defend, create and finish. So, could Hazard emulate them? \u201cAs a No10?\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Mourinho has said that Hazard works well on the left because he is more often one-on-one with his man, where he can use his pace and skill to expose his opponent. It can be more crowded for him in the middle. But when Mourinho detailed his specific requirements for the player who occupies the No10 position for him, it became clear that Hazard did not measure up; that he had concerns over his attitude to the defensive side of things. \u201cWe have different concepts of the No10, me and him,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cFor me, a No10 does a lot of things. With the ball and without the ball. So for me, a No10 is a very special player in my team, when I play with one which, in this period at Chelsea, I have been. \u201cIn my first period here, we played without a No10. We played with two No8s. In a system of two midfield players and one No10, I demand a lot from a No10. Yes, I expect him to work back.\u201d It was put to Mourinho that Hazard does not do enough without the ball. \u201cAre you saying or asking?\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cI am asking,\u201d came the reply. \u201cWe are doing OK now,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cAs a team, we are defending better. A No10, for me, is an eight-and-a-half when the team loses the ball and he is a nine-and-a-half when the team has the ball.\u201d Chelsea have won three of their last four fixtures in all competitions and yet there is the continued sense of a team that is groping for fluency. Tottenham are on the crest of a wave and they will begin as the favourites. With his club in 15th place and their title defence in tatters, Mourinho spoke of having to \u201clearn to live without the happiness of winning matches\u201d. He has been left to hunt for any signs of an upturn. \u201cWe have felt little differences,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cFor example, against Maccabi, they could score twice for 1-1. They didn\u2019t. A couple of minutes later, we get a free-kick. Two-nil. Goodbye. It was the first time where we felt the game could go in another direction and it didn\u2019t. That\u2019s a very good feeling.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
