In a disappointing year, last week's spot-on niggle on this page by Greg Hetherton of Hove was a deserving late winner as the best of 2011's letters to the editor: \"I can't believe the chapels in some of our large towns are filled to the rafters with God-fearing Premier League footballers every Sunday morning. Yet there they are on a Saturday afternoon, crossing themselves, pointing to the heavens and mouthing silent prayers. Reminds me of the old gag \u2013 'Jesus saves, but Shearer gets the rebound'. Give us all a break, lads! Remember Maradona!\" It put me more in mind of Frank Bruno's 14 frantically desperate signs of the cross before the first bell sounded to begin his cataclysmic contest against Mike Tyson in Las Vegas in the late 1980s. Fat lot of good they did, too. Memories here a week ago of the late John Arlott stirred a friend to send the cutting he had hoarded for 35 years of a long-forgotten letter to the editor after John and I had enjoyed a lunch at Lord's on the day we reported on the start of a new cricketing summer. It was from Catherine Waterson of Bishopbriggs, Glasgow: \"Sir, I see that the English cricket season has begun in typically changeable weather. So changeable that the sun did not once come out at Lord's for John Arlott on page 20 but shone all day for Frank Keating on page 21. Yours sincerely.\" A pleasing little last-minute stocking-filler for you this week could be Not In My Day, Sir, 80-odd years of letters on cricket to the Daily Telegraph (Aurum, \u00a314.99) in which the excellent editor Martin Smith cheerfully has no worries about stereotyping the paper's correspondents as bewhiskered Major Major-types sitting in their monogrammed MCC pyjamas and harrumphing about unshaven players in sunglasses, Twenty20 \"whackit\", gum-chewing batsmen, bowlers in glinting jewellery, or the ban on alcohol for picnicking members, as in this from JV Addison OBE, of Dalston: \"Sir, can't they understand that going to a match is all about good cricket, good company, good food. Our lunches at cricket always include beef stroganoff, chicken korma, coronation chicken, asparagus wrapped in ham and poached salmon. How can they expect us to have all this without wine?\" In the Guardian these days football's Premier League attracts most end-of-tether despair. Graham Ball of Bristol sees the league as an allegory of Britain itself: \"Man United buoyed up on a massive balloon of debt. Russian billionaire plays with Chelsea. Arab oil creates blue moon at Man City. How long before China or India run a top team?\" Christopher Wrigley of Chorleywood was dismissively succinct about that shock result in October: \"Abu Dhabi beat Texas 6-1 at the weekend. Where is the interest in that?\" while, this month, Alex Harris of Surbiton brought us closer to home: \"You say that after being knocked out of the Champions League, 'Manchester United and City face fixtures in obscure recession-ravaged places on the edge of Europe'. Don't they already do that every week?\" For the summer of 2012, letters' editors are already gearing up for angry reams of post about Lord Coe's exorbitant five-ringed circus, from the dreaded \"Olympic family\" plutocrats to the use of the verb \"to medal\". It will make a change at least from the usual midsummer's moans about hopeless British tennis players. After a decade of fond enough hand-wringing about nice Tim Henman \u2013 as in this 2004 classic from Brian Christley of Conwy to the Telegraph: \"Sir, stop trying to change our Tim. Gardeners know they shouldn't pick their raspberries until he loses the French, nor their redcurrants till he exits Wimbledon, and so on.\" \u2013 letter writers have now become altogether more bilious, as in last summer's snappy, sniffy poser to the Guardian from Jill O'Kelly Halfacot of Bury St Edmunds: \"If Scotland obtains independence will we no longer have to pretend to like Andy Murray?\" The Times deserves second prize for 2011 thanks to its typically amiable query from John Hobbs of London SW17: \"Sir, if the names of winning horses are to appear in your crossword puzzle, it would be kind if the compiler could asterisk the clues accordingly. The answer to two down in Thursday's crossword was Hit the Headlines \u2013 the name of the winner of the three o'clock at Huntingdon on the same day.\" And a festive toast as well to that paper's Sabbath sister for this pithy piece of pique from Kevin Platt of Sheffield: \"Sir, I wish to complain forcibly that last Sunday's letters didn't include a complaint about Rod Liddle.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
