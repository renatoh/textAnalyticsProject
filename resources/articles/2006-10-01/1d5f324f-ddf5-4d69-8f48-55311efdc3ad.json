When I rang my bank to find out why, I was told it was nothing to do with how I had handled my account - I have held it for more than a year and have always paid on time and usually in full at the end of the month. The bank says it has simply reviewed its lending criteria, and I no longer meet them. I assume this is a reaction to the recent backlash against credit card companies lending money to all and sundry, whether or not they are likely to be able to pay it back. I still don't understand how I could fail to meet the lending criteria - I am in stable, full-time employment, earn more than \u00a320,000 a year and have a good credit history. If the aim of the exercise is to avoid lending money to people who cannot afford to pay it back, why close the accounts of people who have proven they can? Am I reading too much into this? Part of me wonders if my account has been closed specifically because I pay off the balance most months, and am therefore not earning the lender any interest. RT A That part of you has hit the nail on the head. I don't think this review of lending criteria has anything to do with public criticisms of irresponsible credit provision. It's much more likely to have been prompted by the recent Office of Fair Trading clampdown on penalty charges, whereby credit card providers have had to slash the fees they charge for late payments and breaches of credit limit. Faced with losing substantial revenue from these charges, credit card firms are most likely fighting back by cutting losses. This makes sense. In an industry as competitive as the UK credit card market, it would be difficult to generate new revenue by raising interest rates. That runs the risk of losing existing (and potential) customers to cheaper cards. Getting rid of customers who never make any money for the firm, ie those who pay off their balance in full each month, therefore makes more sense. It's appallingly unfair and I'm sure the bank will deny that this is why your card was cancelled, but as you point out, if a securely employed consumer with a clean credit history who has maintained a clean account for more than a year doesn't meet the lending criteria, who does?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
