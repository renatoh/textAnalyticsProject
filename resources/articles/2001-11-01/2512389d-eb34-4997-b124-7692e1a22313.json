We've tried all conventional remedies without success. Have you any advice? Clare Poole, via email Motion sickness is a common disturbance of the inner ear that is caused by subjecting yourself to repeated motion. There are a number of antihistamine drugs available on the market (please refer to your GP) but as you'll know, these are not all suitable for children. You could try giving your son Junior Kwells. These tablets are designed specifically for children and are available over the counter from around \u00a32. They work extremely quickly but relief is short-lived and would not be suitable for longer journeys. A good drug-free option is to purchase wristbands which work by stimulating pressure points. These are available from chemists and cost around \u00a37.50 for two child-sized bands. Ginger root is also a good combatant against travel sickness. Capsules can be purchased from chemists and health food stores. In addition to these remedies there are several preventative methods you can follow. Make sure your son avoids rich, heavy foods prior to departure and replace them with a light starchy meal. Although he won't feel like eating, encourage him to eat light snacks or crackers while you're moving. Keep him amused on the journey but don't let him read - this often heightens feelings of nausea. Fresh air also works wonders for many forms of transport, except planes! If all else fails, perhaps you could follow the advice of one traveller that we've heard of who reportedly sits on newspaper!

Papua New Guinea We're planning a six-month trip around Kenya, New Zealand, Australia, Papua New Guinea, Laos, Vietnam, then overland to Malaysia, and would welcome your advice on the cheapest route, taking into account the best means of transport and the possibility of doing some countries overland. Priscilla Foley, via email A round-the-world fare is ideal for this type of trip. A BA-Qantas World Discovery ticket can include stops in Nairobi, Lusaka, Johannesburg, Sydney, Auckland, Bangkok, then back to London. You're permitted six stops and 29,000 miles, andyour trip is within that. Flying in and out of Bangkok, you have the flexibility to see South-East Asia overland as you please, but a loop through Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, back through Thailand and into Malaysia is a popular route to take. Though you'll find East Africa and Australasia more expensive than Asia, all your destinations can be visited on a budget. The exception to all of the above is Papua New Guinea, which is an unusual and fascinating destination. The country boasts highland trekking, volcanoes, canoeing in remote areas as well as opportunities to visit indigenous communities and truly get off the beaten track. It's an expensive country until you get into remote areas (where there's nothing to buy!) and you need to take special care of your personal safety. To get around you need to take to the air, canoe or walk as there is a limited road network, but this is part of the fun. You'll need to take a separate flight to Papua New Guinea from Australia - returns from Sydney and Cairns start at around \u00a3300. Is Rajasthan safe? I would like to know your views on visiting India (Rajasthan) for four weeks next February. There are three of us; all female and we will be travelling independently. Our only fears are the political situation at the moment. Mrs L Minnings, Crawley Down You've obviously read up about Rajasthan, and it's a smashing place to spend a few weeks. The region is rightly one of the most popular to visit in India, boasting forts, temples, wildlife, exceptional desert and hill scenery and some of the most welcoming people you'll meet in the entire country. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (020 7008 0232/0233) advise that India is currently trouble-free, apart from the regions of Jammu and Kashmir on the Pakistan border. The warning here has been in place since before the conflict in Afghanistan began. Travellers contacting us and reporting on our discussion board say that it's very much business as usual in Rajasthan. You should take the usual precautions a group of female travellers would take anywhere in the world. Between now and February, and once you've left, you should keep a close eye on the situation, and be flexible with your plans. Recent weeks have shown that incidents can spring up quickly and without warning. A useful source of up-to-date news on India is www.timesofindia.com. Single-parent skiing I'm a single parent and would like to take my son skiing early in the New Year. I've looked at a few brochures and all appear to quote prices based on two-children families. Are there any companies flying from Glasgow or Edinburgh which cater for families like ours? Emmanuelle Tulle, Falkirk Neilson Ski Holidays (0870 333 3356) offers single-parent savers on all its holidays throughout the season. If you both share a twin-bedded room, it will offer you 10 per cent off the adult price for your son. Most of the holidays include flights from Manchester or Gatwick, but if you choose one of the resorts in the French Alps (Montgenevre) or Andorra (Pas de la Casa) you'll be able to fly from Glasgow. Neilson arranges holidays in a wide range of destinations and all the resorts have excellent facilities. Ski lessons are available and equipment can be hired - you can arrange all this prior to departure. A one-week ski holiday in January (based on you and your son sharing) will cost around \u00a3650. Zoom on I'm 23, planning to travel early next year, and would like to attend a beginners' photography course before I set off. I have a limited amount of cash. What would you suggest? Ms F. Dean, Berkshire. There are hundreds of photography courses across the UK. Luckily they vary a great deal so it shouldn't be too hard to find one that meets your needs. Websites like www.hotcourses.com and www.citylit.ac.uk are particularly useful in narrowing down the options. Travel Photography by Richard I'Anson (Lonely Planet \u00a39.99) is a great book to have by your side. It's full of handy tips and compact enough to take on the road with you. Having acquired the basic skills, you might wish to consider attending a seminar showing you how to apply what you've learned to travel photography in particular. At Independent Travellers World, held in London on 22-24 February (020 7373 3377), travel photographer Doug McKinlay will be speaking at Lonely Planet's Travel Writing and Photography Workshop. \u00b7 We welcome letters. Tom Hall and Rachel Suddart from Lonely Planet answer as many as possible here. Include a daytime telephone number and postal address. Email travel.tips@observer.co.uk or write to Escape, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER. The writer of the week's star letter wins a Lonely Planet guidebook of their choice.
