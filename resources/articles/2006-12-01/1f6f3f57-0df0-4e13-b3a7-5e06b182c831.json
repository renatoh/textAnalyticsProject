Health secretary Patricia Hewitt yesterday announced a cancer reform strategy at the Britain Against Cancer conference in London. Mike Richards, the cancer tsar, who will develop the strategy, believes that league tables could be a key tool. But the British Medical Association said yesterday that doctors who treat the sickest patients - often in the most deprived areas - could wrongly appear worse than others. The data hospitals held on patient outcomes was not accurate and did not take into account risks such as the patient's age and the nature of their disease. \"Even when you are extraordinarily good, you may have a high mortality. This may put you down in the league tables.\" Very little information on the comparative success rates of hospitals and individual doctors is available to patients. The strategy is intended to tackle the new challenges facing cancer care since the original plan was launched in 2000, including the ageing population and people's expectation that they will get all the expensive new technologies and drugs which are inflating NHS costs. \"Having developed the foundations of a world-class cancer service we have to make it self-sustaining,\" Ms Hewitt told the conference, organised by the all-party group of MPs on cancer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
