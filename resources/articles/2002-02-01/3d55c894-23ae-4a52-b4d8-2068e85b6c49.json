Wary of prejudicing Thursday's Rugby Football Union disciplinary hearing in Bristol, at which Johnson faces a potential three-week ban, the Tigers issued a simple statement revealing only that director of rugby Dean Richards had spoken to his captain and that \"the matter is now closed as far as the club is concerned\". Leicester would not even confirm or deny whether they had imposed an internal fine, a marked change in policy from last month when Austin Healey was accused of tripping the Sale wing Anthony Elliott and the club banned Healey themselves prior to the RFU verdict. The club insist the two cases are not comparable, which strongly suggests the English champions feel Johnson does not merit a suspension from Test duty. The RFU's handling of the matter was yesterday criticised by the outgoing Saracens chief executive Francois Pienaar. According to Pienaar, who is returning home to South Africa at the end of the season after an increasingly unsuccessful tenure at Saracens, the incident should have been dealt with inside 24 hours, thus avoiding any need for the England manager Clive Woodward and others to lobby on Johnson's behalf. \"I understand why they are backing him. I would do the same if I was his coach. But you don't want to put your coach in that position and that's where it is a little bit amateurish,\" said Pienaar. \"This is a professional game and it should be seen to be acting professionally. It's not a case of how long he should be banned or whether he should be banned. If you're going to do anything, it should be done straight away.\" The Saracens owner Nigel Wray, meanwhile, warned several of his current squad they were playing for their futures. \"Without doubt we have a number of players busting a gut and we also have a few players who aren't,\" said Wray. \"We've got to have a harder edge. You can't finance failure. I don't think there's a financial future in being seventh or eighth in the Premiership.\" Wray, though, insists he is not about to walk away from his investment and earlier at Heathrow greeted Tim Lane, the former Springbok assistant coach who is to spend three weeks at the club and is poised to succeed Pienaar. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
