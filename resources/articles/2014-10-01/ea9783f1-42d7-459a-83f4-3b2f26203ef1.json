I don\u2019t care if he bit before\u2019", "bodyText": "Gerard Piqu\u00e9 chose a training session at Barcelona\u2019s Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper complex last week to test whether Luis Su\u00e1rez\u2019s rehabilitation extended to seeing the funny side. The Catalans\u2019 first team were drilling defence versus attack, centre-halves wrestling aggressively with forwards in a cluttered six-yard box while crosses were flung over from the flank. \u201cWe were fighting for the ball all the time,\u201d explained Piqu\u00e9. \u201cWe were scrapping, me and him, so I shouted: \u2018Hey, don\u2019t you dare bite me.\u2019 He just smiled. He knows what he did back in the summer was not right, and he accepts that.\u201d It was a passing flashpoint, some playful ribbing among team-mates, but it offered an insight into Su\u00e1rez\u2019s latest recovery from a high-profile misdemeanour. The four-month ban for biting Giorgio Chiellini during Uruguay\u2019s World Cup victory over Italy in Natal, his third sanction for similar offences, is spent. In the intervening period the striker has been transferred for \u00a375m from Liverpool, where he had been idolised, to Bar\u00e7a with the suspension a test of patience over recent weeks. At the Bernab\u00e9u on Saturday he will be unleashed back into competitive action on the grandest of club stages: el cl\u00e1sico awaits. A lack of match fitness may initially anchor him to the bench but, mentally, he is eager. No one dares suggest he is champing at the bit, but that is the general idea. There is an acceptance he will be rusty. Su\u00e1rez has scored braces for Barcelona B against an Indonesian Under-19 select XI and for Uruguay against Oman, and provided an assist in his other international friendly against Saudi Arabia, but those three outings are his only ones since the summer. This is a collision with European champions. Had July\u2019s original Fifa judgment not been watered down by the court of arbitration for sport then he would not even have been permitted to train while the ban was in place. As it is, Piqu\u00e9 and his team-mates have experienced his quality first-hand. \u201cWhen he first arrived he couldn\u2019t play and hadn\u2019t trained, and was dead after 10 minutes,\u201d laughed the defender. \u201cI was saying: \u2018What happened to you, man?\u2019 But after two or three weeks he started getting fitter, and now he\u2019s ready. In training he\u2019s unbelievable. He has got something. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen it: there will be two or three rebounds in the box and then, definitely, the ball is at his feet and he scores. From nothing he can score. He is a different style of player to those we had before. Xavi, Iniesta \u2026 they are really sweet and you enjoy watching them with the ball. With Luis Su\u00e1rez it is the other side: he fights. But he scores, and that is what it is all about. You can kick him in training and he never falls to the floor. He\u2019ll keep trying to score even if you\u2019re pulling his shirt or fouling him. He is a really fair player. \u201cPeople say he wasn\u2019t in England but, there, if you fall once you have a reputation. In training he never goes to the floor. He pressures defenders to recover the ball. I was really happy we signed him. I don\u2019t care if he bit [someone] before. He knows it\u2019s not the way, and he said he won\u2019t do it again. And he\u2019s in the top three strikers in the world.\u201d El cl\u00e1sico should have flung six of the best forwards in the global game in confrontation. \u201cMaybe the best ever [six],\u201d said Piqu\u00e9. \u201cYears ago Barcelona had Ronaldo, and Madrid had Ra\u00fal, but to have three each of this kind of quality? No.\u201d As it is, Gareth Bale\u2019s untimely buttock injury and Su\u00e1rez\u2019s lack of match fitness have postponed the ultimate in forward-line set-tos, but this is still Leo Messi against Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar against Karim Benzema, with Su\u00e1rez, James Rodr\u00edguez, Ivan Rakitic and Toni Kroos all entering the frenzy for the first time. The contest may lack the poison that festered during the tenures of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Pep Guardiola at the respective clubs, but spikiness endures. Piqu\u00e9 has tasted this occasion often enough in the six years since he left Manchester United, though the adrenaline rush of the biggest club fixture in Spanish football is a constant. \u201cIn England you have the big games but you don\u2019t have el cl\u00e1sico,\u201d he offered with a wink. \u201cIt is different. I have been in the Premier League and [experienced] United against Liverpool but, maybe because I am a Bar\u00e7a fan, Barcelona against Real is a different level. The country just stops for this game. I really enjoyed the rivalry in that time [against Mourinho\u2019s Real] even if it\u2019s true that sometimes it did cross the line, and that was not right. We had to meet up afterwards with Spain. Everything that happens on the pitch must stay out on the pitch. After that you have to remain friends. \u201cThey are strong. Real\u2019s frontline are really quick and powerful. Bale and Cristiano, the wingers, can smash and destroy you if you are not careful. Benzema receives the balls and brings others into the game. But the main thing for us is to be careful when we have the ball because that is when we are open and, if we lose it, they start to run, they play long balls and it\u2019s really difficult to catch them. As defenders, we have to be constantly on our marks. Under Guardiola we played the best football I can remember, playing good games at the Bernab\u00e9u and winning most of them. It has been harder in the last few years as we\u2019ve not played as we did in the past. But it\u2019s difficult to stay at that level. We are talking about one of the best teams in the history of football. \u201cUnder Luis Enrique, we\u2019ve changed the mentality again and we\u2019re pressuring a lot, really high up the pitch. In the first two or three seconds when [the opposition] have the ball they suffer a lot, as our strikers are pushing them. They have no time to build. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid know that if they don\u2019t have the ball they all have to defend, no matter who they are [playing]. They are very compact and difficult to break down. But at Barcelona we are used to having the ball and when we lose it we are open, with a lot of spaces. So if you don\u2019t press they can attack those spaces, then you are dead. I know when you win titles the stars are the strikers and when you don\u2019t it\u2019s because of the goalkeeper and the defenders, but it\u2019s not just about the defenders. It\u2019s about all the team working hard together.\u201d Bar\u00e7a are still adapting to Enrique, even if their league record \u2013 seven wins from eight unbeaten matches and a four-point advantage over Real \u2013 suggests resurgence. Piqu\u00e9 is reluctantly learning that life is about rotation under this manager, with centre-half duties shared between him, Marc Bartra, J\u00e9r\u00e9my Mathieu, Javier Mascherano and, once fully fit, the new arrival Thomas Vermaelen. The World Cup and European Championships winner has started only six games in all competitions, sitting out key clashes such as the loss to Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League. For a player who had won the World Cup at 23 and has claimed two European Cups as well as league titles in England and Spain, life consigned to the fringes can feel incongruous amid constant success. \u201cIt\u2019s not a strange career, it\u2019s a really good career, but now I have a big challenge. At Manchester United I had Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic ahead of me, players who were never injured, never red carded \u2026 fucking hard [to dislodge]. But this is the first time at Barcelona I\u2019m not playing as much as I want to. A lot of people say: \u2018Piqu\u00e9 is not fit or not playing well.\u2019 But Piqu\u00e9 is really playing well. After the World Cup I admitted I maybe hadn\u2019t been at my level, but in pre-season I worked really hard and I\u2019m really happy about my performances during the season. I have to show the coach I can play every game and don\u2019t need to be rotated because I\u2019m desperate to play in El Cl\u00e1sico.\u201d Retaining his place in the team has become the centre-half\u2019s priority. He is settled and content in Catalonia, one recent late-night altercation with the guardia urbana aside, with a young family, Shakira on his arm and successful businesses to his name. He is hands-on off the pitch, whether tweaking his phone app or developing his computer management game. There is no desire to return to United, whose interest is persistent and, given their defensive fragility, understandable. \u201cI was really happy and left a lot of friends there, even if I didn\u2019t play as much as I\u2019d wanted, but I\u2019ve always said I want to stay here all my career and retire at Barcelona,\u201d he added. \u201cAt the moment I\u2019m not thinking about leaving. I\u2019m really happy if it\u2019s true that United want me \u2026 but I\u2019m a Barcelona fan, I have been since I was a kid. I want to stay here.\u201d Piqu\u00e9 on Gareth Bale \u201cHe had a big handicap because he cost a lot of money. There were a lot of questions about him: is he really good? Can he perform well enough to justify costing \u20ac100m? But I think he\u2019s doing a really good job at Real Madrid. I was injured with my hip when he scored in the Copa del Rey final last season [running around Marc Bartra off the pitch to score the winner]. Would I have fouled him? You are talking about not even one second and you have to make a decision. It\u2019s easy when you\u2019re sitting on your sofa and say: \u2018Ah, you have to do this, you little bastard \u2026\u2019 But when you\u2019re on the pitch, it\u2019s really difficult to make a good decision.\u201d Piqu\u00e9 on Spain\u2019s recent toils \u201cA lot of important players such as Xavi, Xabi Alonso and Puyol have retired, while David Villa is in Australia. Vicente del Bosque has to find replacements. It is a difficult time because, obviously, that is half the team. We won the Euros with the old players, but it\u2019s easy for people to criticise given the World Cup was not as good as we\u2019d hoped. But we have two years to change for the France Euros, where Vicente can improve with the others. We have to qualify and try to find the best team.\u201d Piqu\u00e9 on Cesc F\u00e0bregas \u201cCesc went to Arsenal first but they said they had [Mesut] \u00d6zil, so he went to Chelsea instead. He is really happy there, and playing well. He loves London, even if I don\u2019t know if he loves Mourinho. He probably does because he is in the team, playing all the games. In Barcelona it was more difficult for him. It was one of the toughest decisions in his life to leave Bar\u00e7a for a second time but, after three months, you can see he made the right decision. He\u2019s enjoying his life, playing every minute. He doesn\u2019t like to be rotated, and I\u2019m happy for him.\u201d Sky Sports is showing more of the games that matter in an unrivalled schedule of football, including el cl\u00e1sico and Manchester United v Chelsea this weekend"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
