Yes. Racist? Oh, come on ...", "bodyText": "Was Big Brother right to eject 19-year-old Emily Parr for 'racism'? To me, it smacks of self-serving media McCarthyism. Not to mention hypocrisy, considering Channel 4 and Endemol's mishandling of the Shilpa Shetty-Jade Goody debacle. For those who didn't see the incident, when black housemate Charley Uchea started dancing, Parr, a white, middle-class drama student, blurted in faux 'street' tones: 'You pushing it out, nigger.' Parr was later dragged out of bed and, distraught and apologetic, ejected. Strange that didn't happen to Goody, Danielle Lloyd and Jo O'Meara, even though they sang a ditty about 'Pakis' that BB failed to broadcast. With Parr, Big Brother had spoken, in my opinion wrongly. She should not have said that uniquely evil word, but are we pretending that black culture, and, therefore, youth culture, is not sprayed with it, hasn't sanitised it to a degree for immature minds? Indeed, although BB was criticised for showing the 'n-word' incident, it turned out to be the only fair thing it did. Put in context, Parr's remark wasn't even quasi-racist, proving only that she was just another middle-class twit who listens to a bit of Eminem. In Parr's remorseful, trembling, post-eviction interview, she professed herself 'devastated and ashamed', breaking down straight afterwards. Is this what passes for Aryan supremacy these days? I don't think so. Nor, apparently, did the 922 viewers who rang Channel 4 to complain that Parr's eviction was unnecessary. This is where media McCarthyism comes in. For what was Parr's treatment if not a staged witch-hunt, in order to make BB look belatedly tough and anti-racist? No matter that they let Goody stay in the house for ages. And let's ignore the fact that, during her stay, Parr hung out with Uchea, that they were friends. A better ploy might have been to let Parr stay and encourage a debate among the housemates and the nation about how the repellent 'n-word' should never be considered user-friendly. Instead, BB burdened a 19-year-old girl with the sins of Goody et al and tarred her with the 'racist' brush forever. In short, Big Bully threw her to the wolves. What she said was appalling, but this was no race row. Ultimately, it was C4 and Endemol's belated scrabble for the high moral ground that was both sickening and cynical."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
