The 36-year-old, who is being prosecuted following newspaper interviews he gave five years ago after leaving his job, denied the offences at an earlier hearing. Mr Shayler, wearing a dark navy suit with a Remembrance Day poppy in his lapel, was representing himself in the trial and sat in the well of the court rather than in the dock. He faces three charges of disclosing information, disclosing information by interception of communications and disclosing documents. Prosecutor Nigel Sweeney QC said that before leaving in October 1996, Mr Shayler copied or had copied 28 documents, four classified as top secret and 18 secret. Some of these were later recovered from the Mail on Sunday newspaper. The documents contained more than 250 pages of information relating to security or classified matters which he disclosed despite three times signing the Official Secrets Act binding him to secrecy, alleged Mr Sweeney. Mr Sweeney said that the day before the information in the documents was published in the newspaper, Mr Shayler fled abroad for three years. The newspaper articles on August 27 1997 made allegations of inefficiency and mismanagement at MI5. But, said Mr Sweeney, \"given the nature and importance of the work of the security services in protecting our national security, the defendant therefore had a lifelong duty of confidentiality.\" A signed copy of a contract for the supply of information was also recovered from the newspaper's office. Mr Shayler's thumbprint had been found on it. The secret documents fell into seven categories. The largest was entitled Provisional IRA-Libya links 1971-1996, and was marked top secret. It contained 35 pages of secret reports \"from agents and other sources\" over 25 years. Other files included secret files on the 1988 Lockerbie plane disaster, on a particular agent, on subversives, Peter Bleach (a convicted arms dealer), on Operation Shadower, and an internal history of the first 50 years of the service. The documents had been obtained from a few months after Mr Shayler joined MI5 to six months before he left, said Mr Sweeney. Mr Shayler returned to Britain in August 2000 after the European convention on human rights came into force. Upon his return, Mr Shayler was arrested by police and claimed he had acted in the public and national interest. Mr Shayler said he would rely on Article 10 of the convention to impart a public interest defence into this country's law. During the last two years, he has advanced his argument to three different courts, including the highest court in the land presided over by the senior law lord. \"His argument has been rejected unanimously at every stage,\" said Mr Sweeney. The trial continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
