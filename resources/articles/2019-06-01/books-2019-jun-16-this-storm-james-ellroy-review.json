In his day job, he\u2019s coordinating a manhunt for a blood-drinking necrophile, Tommy Glennon, though Smith\u2019s real reason for wanting to find him isn\u2019t the obvious one, having more to do with Glennon witnessing what Smith once got up to at a Nazi orgy in the company of Orson Welles. Sent to tail Glennon, Elmer Jackson (another Ellroy regular, drawn from a real-life detective) unearths little but an address book full of cryptic leads that the rest of the novel spends pursuing. By the time Glennon resurfaces some 400 pages later, he\u2019s been all but drowned out by the intervening litany of sextortion rackets, punishment beatings and other grisly incidents, including the murder of a Chinese restaurateur found fried to death on his own hob. Life here is breathtakingly cheap. When Smith\u2019s double-crossing love interest, Joan (seen in 2014\u2019s Perfidia), drunkenly crashes into a car, the investigating officer can pull strings because her victims are Mexicans with criminal records; she\u2019s never told that two children, in the boot of the vehicle she hit, also died. Such moments aren\u2019t milked for pathos; far from it. When Jackson interviews the widows of two murdered colleagues, Rice and Kapek, we\u2019re asked: \u201cYou want baleful bile? Gas on this: Rice pimped his wife to cover his poker debts. Rice fathered Kapek\u2019s three kids, and vice versa. The widows were lezbo lovers... Rice and Kapek filmed their antics [and] made them wear dirndl skirts and Nazi armbands\u2026\u201d In Ellroy\u2019s crunchy, slang-studded staccato, characters don\u2019t curse but \u201chex\u201d; they \u201corb\u201d things rather than look at them; someone undertakes \u201cperfunctory woof-woof in the missionary manner\u201d. One corrupt cop is introduced by telling us he \u201cspeaks Chinese and drills underage slash\u201d; a prostitute, we\u2019re told, has \u201cgreen eyes. She ran 5\u201910\u201d/150. She induced loooooooow growls.\u201d This Storm isn\u2019t a police procedural \u2013 it\u2019s too sprawling for that \u2013 but interrogation is the basis of its narrative engine, with fog-clearing info-dumps delivered during grimly inventive torture scenes. The frequent bed-hopping does the same job: you suspect Ellroy sees the funny side when Jackson\u2019s lover says: \u201cYou came here to pump me... And I\u2019m not talking about in the sack.\u201d Often, the novel reads like the result of a hyper-caffeinated storyboarding session, with characters that seem to matter less than the cynical, conspiratorial world they represent. It hardly helps that the vast cast is full of aliases and near-homophones, including a Jos\u00e9 Vasquez-Cruz who \u201cwas really Jorge Villareal-Caiz\u201d, and a serial killer known as the Werewolf, who pops up alongside the Wolf, a separate, spectral apparition. Relentless and disorienting it may be, but Ellroy has never been a five-pages-before-bed kind of writer; his vision is more the fever dream after lights out. \u2022 This Storm by James Ellroy is published by William Heinemann (\u00a320).
