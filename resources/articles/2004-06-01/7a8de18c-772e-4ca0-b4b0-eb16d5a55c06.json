The latest creation of award-winning British hotelier Jonathan Wix, Riad Farnatchi already has names including Russell Crowe, Scarlett Johansson and Angelina Jolie scattered through its guestbook - and it's easy to see why. Created from three small riads (traditional medina houses) as a personal holiday getaway for Jonathan's family and friends, it really does feel like you've stepped into a beautiful individual private house rather than Marrakech's latest top-end hotel. In fact, it was only local British hotelier Lynn Perez who convinced him to offer his home up to the public, and the moment they did so, the bookings couldn't have come in faster. First impressions: The moment you step away from the incessant pandemonium of the rabbit warren of tight alleyways of Marrakech's oldest quarter through the unobtrusive gateway into Riad Farnatchi, you know you're somewhere special. The first of the two courtyards is dominated by a bubbling aquamarine seven metre pool scattered with rose petals, with immaculate b'hous (covered sitting areas with one side open to the internal court) around its perimeter to slip back into for a cool drink after my first refreshing dip in the jetstreamed-water. All lit by perfectly subtle traditional lanterns and with stunning-purple bougainvillea draping from the roof to off-set the spotless white walls, it's unmistakably Moroccan and exotic with every comfort you could dream of, including waiters on hand 24-7 to cater for your every need. In fact, with numerous other mesmerising hideaways spread throughout the hotel, not including my own suite, it was only too easy to believe it was my own personal retreat, just as Jonathan intended. The rooms: Each of the five suites has its own unique character, achieved through specially-designed and locally made furniture combined with the sleek lighting and crisp decor to create a mesmerisingly cool, comfortable space. On entering my room, I was greeted with complimentary Moroccan robes (djelaba) and slippers (bobouches) laid out on Egyptian cotton sheets of the unfeasibly large king-size bed, so I had literally no excuse not to instantly slip into something more comfortable. All five suites have identical spec, with satellite flat-screened TV, stereo CD players, auto-dimming lighting and an internet connection - there's even a selection of DVDs and CDs so it couldn't feel more like your own bedroom. And don't bother searching for the minibar - simply call reception and anything will be brought straight up, either to your room or on your own private balcony overlooking the central courtyards. Each suite also has a separate lounge area with open fireplaces for those chilly winter nights and a range of chaise longue and armchairs to kick back on with some mint tea and delicate pastries. The bathroom: Lit by a combination of gorgeous overhead latticed windows and further traditional lanterns, the swimming pool-sized marble bath and power shower make you wonder how far from the Sahara you really are. With more bath oils and soaps than you could ever know what to do with and piles upon piles of fluffy white towels, it couldn't have been more of a contrast to the outside dust and dirt of the Medina. The restaurant: Riad Farnatchi has its own Berber cook who bakes homemade bread and is the undoubted genius behind each evening's individually-created menu, including all manner of preserves and pickles. Breakfast is included and there are complimentary canapes before dinner, which can be eaten by candlelight either in your room, the candlelit dining room, your muslin-draped balcony or on the roof terrace looking over the city towards the snow-capped Atlas mountains. Each meal is individually arranged for your palate, although only Moroccan food is served. If you're craving something non-native, there's a take away system with a European restaurant around the corner, plus free fruit, teas and pastries throughout the day. What else is there? The roof garden has a barbecue and sunloungers so you can top up your tan without offending the local Muslim population and exposing your flesh at street level. Downstairs in beautiful white marble hammams guests can enjoy traditional gommage, a spine-tingling combination of a Turkish bath with body-scrubbing, seaweed treatment and massage. What is there to see nearby? Lynne can organise any number of trips in and around Marrakech for guests, from a day's walking in the Atlas Mountains, to a guided tour of the souks so you can fill your bags with all manner of rugs and furniture to transform your own home into a Wix creation. The best thing: A rub-down in the hammam followed by dinner under the stars on the roof terrace watching the sun go down over the Atlas Mountains. The worst thing: The price (but with all the free goodies, it's definitely worth it) and the lack of air-conditioning, which is promised for this autumn. How much? From \u00a3180 per room per night."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
