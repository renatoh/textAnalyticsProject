The news comes amid widespread allegations of electoral fraud, and follows an attack by the Conservative party deputy leader, Michael Ancram, who today accused ministers of \"playing fast and loose\" with democracy. At prime minister's questions, Mr Ancram criticised the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, for his decision to roll out all-posting pilots across the north-east, north-west, east Midlands and Yorkshire. The move followed reports of electoral fraud, late delivery of ballot papers and some voters being yet to receive their voting packs. It has also been reported that police are investigating claims of widespread fraud and vote-stealing in postal ballots, the latest in a series of problems to hit the controversial trial of postal voting. Mr Ancram accused Mr Prescott of \"breathtaking complacency\" over his decision to ignore advice from the Electoral Commission and press ahead with all-postal ballots in four English regions, calling for the government to return to the ballot box. Standing in for Tony Blair, who is at the G8 summit, Mr Prescott replied that MPs should \"celebrate\" the fact that one million additional votes had already been cast in areas trialling all-postal ballots. His comments were backed when the office of the deputy prime minister published the latest turnout figures, confirming that voters have risen to the postal challenge. The four regional returning officers overseeing the European elections have reported a significant increase in votes, with more than a day still remaining before ballots close. Yorkshire and the Humber has already recorded a 28.25% turnout, a significant improvement on its 19.6% statistic of five years ago. The north-east has seen turnout rise to 26.4%, up from 19.6% at the last count, and the east Midlands is close to recording a third of potential votes in the area (29.9%), up from 22.6% in 1999. The north-west is lagging with 25.5%, but that still represents a remarkable shift from its previous 19.6% total. Voters outside the four regions could also opt for postal voting, although the numbers who have done so countrywide remains unclear, and the returns have yet to be collected. In London, 400,000 of the capital's 5.2 million voters opted to elect their MEP, London assembly member and mayoral choice by post."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
