But in this entertaining musical, we see sisters worshipping some Jimmy Choos. It's an unusual image \u2013 and shoes are an unusual subject for a show. But it's a good way to put across the fact that, for some women, shoes can become an obsession. We have one customer who became so fixated by a pair of our pink sling-backs that she gave them to Porsche and asked them to custom-spray a car in the exact same colour. That shows what a serious business shoes can be, which is why I was disappointed by the slapstick tone of this musical: every few scenes, we see a dancer come out wearing a new piece of extreme footwear, from 3ft-long shoes to a pair of fishermen's galoshes. The audience fell about, but I'd say the focus on comedy meant the show failed to address the importance some women attach to shoes. In one sketch, a man asks a woman how she can possibly spend thousands on shoes. I'd call that a tad chauvinistic: men spend thousands on cars, so why shouldn't women spend the same sort of money on shoes? Many of our customers have a minimum of 100 pairs; we have young girls shopping with us who've run out of space, and are storing them in the loft. One customer's husband has converted two entire rooms of their house into cupboards to house her collection. Now there's a man who understands his wife. Another song talks about the injuries you can get from ill-fitting shoes: things like bunions, calluses and broken toes. Whether you wear flats or high heels, you do have to be careful. Last summer, flat open-toed sandals were everywhere. I bet hundreds of women ended up in hospital after dropping a saucepan on their toes. \u2022 Aydin Kurdash works for Gina shoes (gina.com).
