The first round of 2,900 job losses, for instance, the move of nearly 2,000 staff to Manchester, or perhaps the pledge to invest hundreds of millions of pounds in a new era of quality comedy and drama programming. So hats off to the Evening Standard, then, for identifying the most earth-shattering consequence of the unprecedented upheaval. \"The job losses are likely to further depress the stagnant property market in west London,\" read the second paragraph of the Standard's This Is London website. Calamity indeed. \u00b7 No one loves a campaign more than Sun editor Rebekah Wade, so the paper's ground-breaking initiative against political correctness gone mad (copyright R. Littlejohn), the Save our Christmas campaign, was something of a no-brainer. If only the good people of News International had joined in. Monkey hears the corporate Christmas cards from Wapping contain the traditional Christian message: \"Season's greetings\". Come on, fellas, get with the programme! \u00b7 Janet Street-Porter's earbashing of Paul Burrell was one of the highlights (if you can call it such a thing) of ITV's I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here!. But Sky boss Dawn Airey wasn't impressed, complaining at the Royal Television Society review of the year that the antics of a scantily-clad Street-Porter had \"set back feminism 100 years\". Airey didn't stop there, and laid into the former Independent on Sunday editor's \"pendulous white monstrosities ... and I don't mean her teeth\". So that's feminism back 100 years, and sisterhood back around, ooh, 250. \u00b7 Announcing his masterplan for the corporation last week (cutting programme budgets and using the savings to invest in new programming? Brilliant!), director general Thompson was naturally keen to stress that every penny of licence fee money is well spent. Which made Monkey wonder why he chose a studio in TV Centre - hardly the most auspicious of surroundings - to make his announcement rather than the purpose-built (and lavishly funded) media centre just up the road. Less mystifying was the look on the faces of the cameramen filming the dg when he announced the sale of BBC Resources, putting them in the redundancy firing line. Lucky they weren't wired for sound. \u00b7 Has James Murdoch been visited by spectral apparitions in the night? We only ask after the broadcaster's minibuses, normally used to ferry staff to the nearby tube station, are being deployed at lunchtimes this week to help staffers stock up with Christmas presents. Eager shoppers are being bussed to Ealing, Richmond and Kew, but have to ensure they are back in time for some hard graft. Merry Christmas, one and all. \u00b7 Monkey's thought for the week: Location, Location, Location presenter Kirstie Allsopp in the Daily Mail. \" I managed to find a flat for the journalist Jonathan Freedland. He then wrote a wonderful article in the Guardian about how well I'd done, and that led to me being called up by Channel 4.\" At last, the TV property boom explained. \u00b7 At the London Evening Standard bosses have been hard at work explaining to vendors why they are being asked to give away 100,000 copies of the free Standard Lite - and all for an extra \u00a320 a day. \"People don't cross the road to buy the Standard any more,\" suggested one circulation chief, much to the ire of one of the vendors present. \"Yes they do, and you know why? Quality of service.\" There were also complaints that when it rains punters buy the paper from railway stations rather than news-stands. Unfortunately for them, not even Associated boss Paul Dacre can do anything about the weather. Not yet, anyway. \u00b7 What better excuse can there be than Donal MacIntyre's triumphant return to Channel Five to delve into our new book of the month, MacIntyre, the story of the great man's first investigative series for BBC1. Over to you, Donal. \"Journalism is too small or too distant a word to cover it,\" says Donal. Crikey. \"It is theatre; there are no second takes. It is drama - it is improvisation, infiltration and psychological warfare. It is destructive. It is exhilarating, dangerous and stressful. It is the greatest job. It is my job: undercover.\" More from Big Mac - never knowingly understated - soon. \u00b7 And, for a final word, back to the BBC. Thommo kicked off his speeches last week with the folksy anecdote of how one of his children had just found \"the letter that changed my life\" inside an old book in a cardboard box when they recently moved house. Dated April 1979, it offered him a coveted BBC traineeship and launched his career. Monkey would have assumed that, once found, the letter would have been treated with care. Sadly not: Thompson, clearly distracted by the events of the past week, has lost the letter again. And this time, he is unlikely to find it again, having left it in a motorway caff somewhere off the M4."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
