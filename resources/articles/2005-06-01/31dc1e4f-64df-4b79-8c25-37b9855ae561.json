He is the prime minister. The foreign minister is Diogo Freitas do Amaral. In a report headed Violence hits Muslim sect in Bangladesh, page 17, early editions June 16, we incorrectly stated that Irene Khan, the secretary-general of Amnesty International, is a member of the Ahmadiya community. That is not the case. Amnesty's involvement has been in documenting human rights abuses against the community. An article headlined Credit to unsung heroes for debt cuts, on the economics page, page 25, yesterday, was wrongly attributed to Ashley Seager, the Guardian's economics correspondent. It was written by Ann Pettifor, the former leader of the Jubilee 2000 campaign and now director of Advocacy International Ltd. In an article headed Flying the flag for the Euro courses, page 4, June 18 (published with Jobs &amp; Money), we neglected to include Turkey among the fully participating countries in the Erasmus post-graduate exchange programme. Turkey has been taking part since April 1 2004. An article about Greg Rusedski, page 32, Weekend, June 18, referred to the player's family \"watching [Roscoe] Tanner win Wimbledon\". In fact, LR (Roscoe) Tanner never did win Wimbledon. He achieved his best result in the tournament in 1979 as runner-up to Bjorn Borg. Our report, UK basks in hottest days of the year, page 4, yesterday, stated that Britain's record temperature of 38.1C (100.6F) was recorded in Gravesend, Kent, in August 2003. In fact, the previous UK record of 37.1C at Cheltenham on August 3 1990, was beaten by a number of stations on August 10 2003, including Gravesend. However, Brogdale near Faversham (Kent) actually reported the highest at 38.5C. \u00b7 Just published: Only Correct, The Best of Corrections and Clarifications.
