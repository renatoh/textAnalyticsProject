Cyclone Harold made landfall on the north and west of the country on Monday, after spending Sunday sitting off the country\u2019s west coast, gathering strength. The Vanuatu meteorology and geo-hazards department warned that hurricane force winds, reaching up to 235km/h were expected across parts of the country on Monday, as well as heavy rainfalls, flash flooding and \u201cvery rough to phenomenal seas\u201d. Images coming through from Vanuatu early on Monday morning showed properties flattened in the country\u2019s second-largest city of Luganville. \u201cCommunications to Santo and Malekula [Vanuatu\u2019s two largest islands] are cut now, so we don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening,\u201d said Eric Durpaire, the chief of Vanuatu\u2019s field office for Unicef Pacific, over the phone from the country\u2019s capital of Port Vila. \u201cThe latest information we had was that the roof of the municipality building of Santo has collapsed and there is flooding.\u201d The cyclone has arrived as the Pacific nation is trying to make preparations for Covid-19. Vanuatu is one of the few countries in the world that does not have any confirmed cases of the virus, but there are fears that were an outbreak to occur its health system would struggle to cope. Vanuatu is in a state of emergency, with borders closed to international arrivals, a curfew, and gatherings of more than five people banned. The government lifted some of these restrictions as the cyclone approached in order to allow people to gather at mass evacuation centres, with Durpaire saying it was a question of prioritising the greatest threat to life. \u201cThe government were doing a great job in preparing for coronavirus initially and since last Friday the focus has been in preparing for the cyclone,\u201d he said. There are fears that any recovery efforts after the cyclone has passed through will be hampered by the restrictions on international travel due to the coronavirus. \u201cRestrictions to international borders and travellers won\u2019t be lifted after the cyclone. Humanitarian workers who wanted to come and assist, won\u2019t be able to, or they will have to do 14 days quarantine,\u201d said Durpaire. Elizabeth Faerua, Oxfam in Vanuatu country director, said while there have been no confirmed Covid-19 cases in the country \u201ca significant disaster at this time could present serious logistical challenges to delivering life-saving aid, while adding to the significant economic and social toll the global pandemic has already taken on the country.\u201d Cyclone Harold has already caused damage and loss of life as it has moved across the Pacific region. On Friday, 27 people were swept off a ferry in Solomon Islands as Harold caused heavy seas. On Sunday, police reported they had retrieved the bodies of three women and two men from the water, though 22 people were still missing. Cyclone Harold, then a category two storm, crossed just to the south of Solomon Islands early on Friday. The MV Taimareho set sail early on Friday in strong winds with 738 passengers including crew and the captain on board. The boat was chartered as part of the country\u2019s response to coronavirus as a way of transporting people back to their home island of Malaita."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
