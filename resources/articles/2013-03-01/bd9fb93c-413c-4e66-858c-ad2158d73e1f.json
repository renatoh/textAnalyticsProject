The ball emerges from the former. Long gone are the days when supporters of the 15-a-side game could mock the rival code for a set piece that, while not being a contest for possession, is an effective means of restarting play. The scrum in rugby union has degenerated into a mess that vexes referees, perplexes spectators and \"apoplexes' players and coaches. \"What was that for?\" the England prop Dan Cole asked the touch judge early in the second half on Saturday when his side had been penalised for the fifth time in six scrums against Wales in Cardiff. It was difficult for anyone to see. England's management has complained to the International Rugby Board about how the referee, Steve Walsh, a New Zealander, handled the scrum. There were 12 in the match: five resulted in penalties for Wales, who were also awarded three free-kicks. A solitary penalty went the way of the visitors. There were seven resets and the ball came out of the back of only three scrums, two in the final 90 seconds when the game was over and neither front row could be bothered to contest. The tone was set five minutes into the game when Wales knocked the ball on near England's 22. The first two scrums were reset before Ben Youngs was penalised for delaying the put-in. Wales opted for a scrum from the free-kick and, after another reset, the ball came out for the home team to use. The sequence lasted more than three minutes and the next seven scrums, between the 22nd and 74th minutes, resulted in a penalty or free-kick, all except the one going to Wales who kicked one of the penalties for three points, compared to 12 points from the seven penalties England conceded at the breakdown. After being penalised, Youngs protested that Wales had engaged too early and that the free-kick should have gone the other way. \"I thought that the first reset should have been a penalty to Wales,\" said the former Lions, Pontypool and Wales prop, Graham Price, renowned as the greatest scrummager of his era. \"Cole went straight to ground.\" One scrum, many opinions. Another former Wales tight-head, Dai Young, Wasps' director of rugby, fears the scrum has become too difficult to referee. \"So many of the calls are 50-50,\" he said. \"Even I, with all my experience of playing in the front row, very often cannot tell who should be penalised. Most decisions could go either way and what has to be sorted out going forward is the hit, the coming together of the front row at the end of the 'crouch, touch, engage' sequence. Scrummaging technique has given way to power and the team that does not get the hit looks for ways to offset its disadvantage.\" England have been accused of being bitter in defeat by complaining about the referee but they have an unexpected ally in the former Australia coach Eddie Jones, who is now in charge of Japan. \"Steve Walsh looked worried every time the scrum went down,\" he said. \"You could see the stress in his facial expression. It gets harder for refs all the time, so it was a masterstroke by Wales to make a prop, Gethin Jenkins, captain against England. Wales dominated the match through the scrummage and all the subsequent scrum penalties they received. Subconsciously Jenkins's status as captain must have influenced those decisions.\" Wales had been awarded seven of the nine scrum penalties/free-kicks at Murrayfield the previous week when Scotland were penalised four times for wrongly anticipating the engage call and hitting too early. Hit and miss. \"The hit has become everything and it has not only taken away the art of scrummaging but disfigured the scrum because the team that does not get the hit tries to force a reset,\" said Price. The International Rugby Board, which had tried to encourage attacking play from scrums in the 2000s by making defenders stand five metres back, last year published a report on the scrum based on a study by Bath University that was monitored by the IRB's scrum steering group, which contains a number of former front-row forwards. Among the conclusions were that the hit needed to be removed, replaced by a passive engagement that would put an emphasis on technique, and that the laws should be coached and refereed correctly. The IRB this month started a trial in the Pacific Rugby Cup series that, while not outlawing the hit, modifies it so that after the touch call the props bind on each other before the order to engage. The aim is to make the hit more stable and reduce the chance of early engagement. The initialsigns are said to be encouraging but the matches involve reserve players from Super 15 sides, the A teams of the three South Seas islands, and Japan. It is at Tier 1 level where the scrum problem is most acute, especially in Europe, and any further trial would have to be global from next season. \"The scrum has to be static before the ball is put in,\" said Young. \" Without that any change will not work. There have been questions raised about coaches and whether they encourage players to cheat if they do not get the hit but for me it does not go further than telling the scrum-half not to put the ball in if our scrum is retreating. The pity is that we do not practise scrum moves because it has, sadly, become an area not to launch attacks from but to get points or position through penalties.\" To Price the scrum should resemble a tug-of-war with no one pushing until the two front rows are set over the line of scrimmage. \"It has come to resemble a 100m race with props anticipating the starting gun,\" he said. \" There have been issues with the scrum through the ages but it used to be about scrummaging. It is not now and its real value must be restored.\" Both Price and Young believe an aggravating factor in scrum collapses is the skin-tight jersey now worn. \"There is not much to bind on to and perhaps props should have different kit,\" said Price. Young, too, believes a tipping point has been reached. \"No one wants to see resets and collapses. It has reached the stage where it is ruining the game,\" he said. \"And how is it that although there are not many scrums in a game, no position is valued more than tight-head prop?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
