Speculation about Beckham's private life has led to suggestions that the Londoner is keen for a summer move to Stamford Bridge, where he is known to be admired by the owner, Roman Abramovich. The story relates to an election campaign being mounted by Enrique Sobrino, a millionaire candidate for the Real Madrid presidency who says he will reverse the policies of Florentino P\u00e9rez and offload a number of los galacticos .But Beckham's representatives claim the Chelsea reports are \"rubbish\". \"Three or four weeks ago there was an interview in which David said everything is going very well at Real Madrid and he is happy there,\" said a source. \"He said he has no intention of going to Chelsea. The situation has not changed.\" Beckham's contract at Real runs until 2007 and for the most part he has been well received by the fans. But Sobrino said: \"Beckham has to change. I would listen to offers for him.\" His claim that he would be more than prepared to sell the England captain - and that Luis Figo and Roberto Carlos would be on borrowed time - has been taken even less seriously in Spain than England, not least because he is reckoned to have no chance of winning, not even if P\u00e9rez decides against standing. P\u00e9rez has not yet declared his intentions - and his commitment to Real Madrid has been a serious bone of contention with the board of ACS, the $600m (\u00a3330m) construction company over which he presides. However, if he stands he will almost certainly win. After all, it was he who achieved the impossible by clearing Madrid's $270m debt and gathered together their most glamorous team with the purchases of Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, Figo and Beckham. P\u00e9rez would stand by Beckham if the Englishman wanted to stay. Sources insist that he will stand but even if he does not, opening the way for the current director of football Emilio Butragueno, Sobrino hardly carries enough weight. He is seen as a chancer, a not entirely serious option all but ignored by the press and Madrid supporters. Besides, there is no indication that selling Beckham, still popular with the fans, would be much of a vote winner. Quite the contrary. Sobrino has not elaborated on the statement, nor clarified the reasons why he would be willing to see Beckham leave, but what the Englishman is seen to represent is regarded by some as a significant factor. The allegations about Beckham's off-pitch liaisons and the state of his marriage have emerged at a sensitive time, with Real slipping into a crisis which some consider has been exacerbated by the activities of some of the squad. A 30-metre banner hung at their Las Rozas training ground last week saying: \"For you lot, whores and money; for us, indignation and repression.\" Such accusations were aimed more at Ronaldo and Roberto Carlos and nobody doubts Beckham's whole-hearted commitment, but his arrival has been seen as an open invitation for Spain's voracious gossip press. Traditionally concerned with Andalucian bullfighters, flamenco singers and Marbella-prowling playboys, it is now taking a keener interest in footballers. Should Beckham want to go and again take his chance with the British press, the cause of his current problems after all, then that is a different matter altogether."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
