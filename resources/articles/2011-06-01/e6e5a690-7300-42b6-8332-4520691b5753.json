As the 5-2 favourite, and the strongest chance that the Queen is ever likely to have to win Flat racing's most important Classic, he was a win-only proposition. He did not have much luck in running, and was beaten barely a length to finish third, but after all the build-up, the sense of disappointment was significant. While the dream of a Derby winner in the Queen's colours was extinguished, the result also showed that Carlton House is one of the most talented racehorses of his generation. Every other possibility for his three-year-old season is still alive, and will remain so if he can win the Irish Derby at the Curragh on Sunday, for which he seems sure to start favourite. His owner, at least, has maintained a positive outlook since Carlton House's defeat at Epsom. \"Of course, she must have been disappointed,\" John Warren, the Queen's racing manager, said on Friday, \"though I can't say exactly what she felt, only she could do that. But being as stoical as she is, I got the impression that she was also thrilled to have a horse that is actually of this calibre, and with his future in front of him after Epsom since the margins were as close as they were. \"Sunday's race is very exciting and everyone is looking forward to it. The second [Treasure Beach], third, fourth [Memphis Tennessee] and fifth [Native Khan] from Epsom are all coming together again, and they were all very close at the business end of the race. \"These are all young horses that are improving all the time, and some might have come out of Epsom better than others, and some might have improved more significantly than others. It's going to be a fascinating race.\" Carlton House's preparation for the Derby was briefly interrupted by a minor setback less than a week before the Classic. That has not been advanced as an excuse for his defeat by Pour Moi and Treasure Beach, but his trouble-free run towards the Curragh is reflected in his odds, which strongly suggest he will find the three-quarters of a length that separated him from Treasure Beach at Epsom. Treasure Beach enjoyed a much smoother passage in the Derby, always close to the lead under Colm O'Donoghue and then able to strike for home at a time of his rider's choosing. Carlton House was slightly hampered by fading outsiders, and then sent towards the lead from further back, and perhaps a little earlier, than his jockey, Ryan Moore, would have preferred. \"The one thing we do know is that he has come out of the Derby extremely well,\" Warren said. \"Sir Michael [Stoute] seems really pleased with the horse, as are all of his team at home who live with him day in and day out. \"There seems to be quiet confidence about the way he is going to perform, but with the margins so small, you can't gaze into a crystal ball and that's what makes it such fun. It's not a case of one runaway winner taking on the rest again. \"What we will learn about is all the little issues that went against Carlton House before he ran [at Epsom] and during the race, that may or may not make a difference.\" Victory for Carlton House on Sunday in one of the three major European Derbys would also guarantee his future career as a stallion. As a product of Sheikh Mohammed's Darley Stud breeding operation, his pedigree is impeccable, as he is by the Dubai World Cup winner Street Cry \u2013 also the sire of the brilliant Zenyatta and the 2007 Kentucky Derby winner, Street Sense \u2013 out of the mare Talented, who won the Sun Chariot Stakes with Willie Carson in the saddle back in 1993. Once his racing career is over, Carlton House could well retire to the Queen's own stud on the Sandringham estate, where Motivator, the 2005 Derby winner, would be one of his neighbours. The National Stud in Newmarket, where Bahamian Bounty is currently the star stallion at \u00a310,000, is another possibility. For the moment, though, all connected with Carlton House have fixed their attention on his racing career, which extends to four races so far and could still lead him all over the racing world during the second half of the Flat season and beyond. \"There are so many options, and he really could race anywhere,\" Warren said. \"He could go to Dubai [for the World Cup meeting in March] potentially, but that's all guesswork at this point and we are just dealing with what we have in hand. It's fantastic fun to know that the Queen has a really lovely horse to go to war with.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
