I hope to use him as much as possible during the game.\" Anelka has not appeared for France since the 1-1 draw in Australia last November but the coach insisted his display in Paris would not be make or break for the World Cup. Lemerre wants the former Arsenal and Real Madrid striker, winning his 27th cap, to prove he can still perform at his past levels, especially in terms of scoring. \"This is something he did at Arsenal. At Liverpool it's difficult to judge him as he hasn't been there too long.\" Fulham's striker Steve Marlet was last night called up by France as cover for David Trezeguet, who faces a test on a thigh injury. Marlet scored once in last month's 5-0 win over Scotland as a substitute. Meanwhile Zinedine Zidane warned France's rivals this summer that the defending champions \"seem stronger, perhaps even than in 1998\". Argentina, England's second opponents in the World Cup in June, have named Barcelona's Javier Saviola to replace Gabriel Batistuta in their squad against Germany in Stuttgart. Batistuta received a head wound playing for Roma on Sunday and was taken to hospital but suffered no serious injury. His club and country, though, are taking no risks. This is another World Cup setback for Batistuta. Both he and Hernan Crespo missed the 2-2 draw with Cameroon last month through injuries and, with Crespo still unfit, opportunity knocks for the 20-year-old Saviola. Argentina rest Juan Sebastian Veron so that the Manchester United midfielder has more time to recover from niggling ankle trouble. Coventry's goalkeeper Magnus Hedman is out of Sweden's squad to face Norway in Oslo because of a family illness. England will open their World Cup campaign against the Swedes on June 2. Italy have suffered a double blow with their midfielder Demetrio Albertini out of the World Cup and the striker Christian Vieri missing the friendly with Uruguay in Milan. Albertini, 30, has an achilles tendon injury and his club Milan said he would be out for \"two to three months if there are no complications\". Vieri, who missed last month's 2-1 win in England with groin trouble, now has a thigh injury. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
