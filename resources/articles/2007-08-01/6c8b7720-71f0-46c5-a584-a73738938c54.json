The Russian, whose retirement through injury against Argentina's Martin Vassallo Arguello at the Poland Open last week caused Betfair to void \u00a33.4m of wagers, said: \"Normally who knows [what the] injury [was]? \"Only me and my wife before the tournament. I already didn't know if I can finish the first match and how [it would get so] painful there.\" Davydenko insisted his bad toe was to blame for his withdrawal in Sopot. \"I start to play. If I feel OK, if I can finish the match, it is good for me. I try to win. If I cannot finish the match, if I am losing the match already, I cannot finish, I am retired. I don't know how can people know about my injury.\" Asked if he had ever received phone calls offering money to throw a match, he said: \"Nobody knows my numbers. Also, normally ATP call only my manager or my brother. Nobody from the Russian Federation knows my numbers. Only private people, like my family or my manager, my brother. That's it. Before, my number got many press [calls]. That's what I really change in the last year. I don't want somebody to call me and make some questions about a match. \" The ATP has not yet spoken to Davydenko about the betting situation, though representatives of the men's tour are travelling to London to consult horse racing experts about how to tackle corruption in sport. On court yesterday Davydenko, the world No5 who is the fourth seed here, moved into the fourth round of the Rogers Cup with a 7-6, 6-3 win over his compatriot, Mikhail Youzhny. In the quarter-finals he will meet the Czech Radek Stepanek, who beat Tommy Haas of Germany 6-3, 2-6, 6-2. The world No1, Roger Federer, made short work of Andy Murray's conqueror, defeating the Italian Fabio Fognini 6-1, 6-1."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
