Well-to-do ladies in fur coats and young men in the blue shirts of the Falangist party sent a message to the prime minister, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero, that they will not be cowed by a new law banning them from marking the anniversary of his death in future. The historical memory law will ban all political rallies outside the Valle de los Ca\u00eddos (Valley of the Fallen), but fascist and far-right groups accused Zapatero of \"rewriting history\". \"We will come regardless ... I am here because I am Spanish, and Catholic, to honour the memory of our Caudillo, the purest sword in Europe,\" said Jorge Espin\u00f3s, a 21-year-old economics student. \"My grandfather killed 156 Reds with his machine gun in Galicia in 1936, and then went off to eat seafood.\" The law was the brainchild of Zapatero, whose grandfather was killed by Franco's forces, and is an attempt to recognise the republican victims of the civil war and dictatorship. The law, which will come into force once it passed by the upper house, will see the remaining Francoist symbols removed from Spain's public buildings. Chants of \"Reds no, Reds no!\" and \"Zapatero - you son of a bitch!\" rang out across the valley as banners bearing the Cross of St James, known as Matamoros (Moorslayer), and pre-democratic Spanish flags were unfurled. But the largest cheers were reserved for Carmen Franco Polo, daughter of the late dictator, whose arrival and departure were greeted with sustained cries of \"Franco! Franco! Franco!\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
