Please do not read on if you are not up to date. \u201cThere is nothing regular about this villain.\u201d Ah, Javert! The pain, the humiliation. When surely he must know deep inside that he is the one who is a bit irregular. An excellent outing, prolonging the to-ing and fro-ing between Jean Valjean (Dominic West) and Javert (David Oyelowo) as the action moved to Paris and the stakes were raised. Cosette is saved. But how long can she remain safe while Javert is on the warpath? The net, inevitably, tightened around Valjean this week as Javert showed himself to be the most assiduous copper in the history of policing. Luckily, the fugitive papa and his blonder-by-the-second sidekick were able to hide with a convent of nuns imported from The Sound of Music, Nazi-evading narrative and all. (\u201cDon\u2019t rush to open the door, Reverend Mother!\u201d) Phew. Before all the drama in the final third, there was a lot of narrative to get through. This is a quality adaptation, but without the acting talent to carry it, I think it would feel heavy. West as Valjean is pretty much perfect. He\u2019s menacing when he needs to be, pitiful at other points and bravely majestic at others. His face during the court scene at Arras when he faced his destiny \u2026 this was the bit where a man pretending not to be Valjean rode to the rescue of the man who was not Valjean, but everyone thought was Valjean. The noises of the crowd in the court were priceless, giving their \u201coohs\u201d and \u201caahs\u201d as the prisoners showed the marks that meant they knew the real Prisoner 24,601. Of course, Fantine was great in her death throes. But this was another scene stolen by West\u2019s heartbreaking portrayal of humility. It would be hard to find a more pathetic death scene, and there were tears in our household. I had to suppress a snort, though, at this hilariously insensitive line: \u201cShe\u2019s dead and you\u2019re my prisoner.\u201d Javert misjudges the mood yet again. Read the room, Javert! She\u2019s just died. Two years passed in the blink of a specially designed miserable font, and a great moment was bestowed upon us: the return of the hair and teeth dealer (Ron Cook) with his handmade creepy dolls! As far as I\u2019m aware, this was an entertaining bit of poetic licence from writer Andrew Davies, conjuring up the idea that the doll may even have had Fantine\u2019s hair. (Pretty sure this connection is not explicit in the original.) There was more misery to come \u2013 the title of this piece is never wasted \u2013 as not even Olivia Colman could wring an ounce of comedy out of Cosette\u2019s horrible fate. Thankfully, though, once Valjean had had some bread and cheese, he was able to give all the money in the entire world to this \u2019orrible pair and go to Paris so that he could, completely coincidentally, cross paths with Javert again. Remarkable coincidences are the hallmark of 19th-century literature, so it is only natural that they should start to stack up by this stage. Of all the children Valjean should pass fetching water in the woods \u2026 it\u2019s Cosette! Of all the police inspectors the nosy neighbour could report to \u2026 it\u2019s Javert! Of all the nuns in the whole of Paris, it\u2019s a nun he already knows! There\u2019s no plot without these coincidences, so we have to forgive them. But they can feel harder to overlook in adaptations than in a novel, and require the poor actors to have to work even harder to style it out and make it look like this was meant to happen. Some beautiful moments this week, though, and you can\u2019t fault them for a) keeping it real and b) being faithful to the original. However, I can\u2019t help but feel it would be even better to watch The Tale of the Hair and Teeth Dealer. More hair and teeth dealer! More! Least convincing romantic encounter How believable is the relationship between Monsieur and Madame Th\u00e9nardier? In the first two episodes, I was hesitant. Why wouldn\u2019t she run away from him? Why should we believe that she would stay? Neither character is an easy part to play straight and they\u2019re far more easily portrayed as ghouls or clowns (as in the Hollywood version). But somehow the portrayal here feels real and menacing, with Adeel Akhtar and Colman able to wring the occasional ounce of comedy out of a tricky situation. Not easy when what they are depicting is so nasty. This was the most awkward bit: \u201cWould you like the girl in here with you for a small consideration? No need for the wife to know.\u201d This exchange encapsulated the difference between Les Mis\u00e9rables the musical and this version. Unflinchingly horrible and realistic, with a real awareness of just how sadistic these characters were in Victor Hugo\u2019s universe. The Gwyneth Paltrow onion for tears on demand The onion is awarded alongside a large hunk of bread and cheese to Dominic West for having the ability to wring tears out of a stone. His relationship with Cosette could have seemed cheesy or creepy, and yet was deeply touching. She represents his redemption as a human being. She is his one chance to prove to himself that he is the man he says he is. Every wrinkle of West\u2019s brow and every tiny gesture transmits this. Bravo! \u201cEcoutez et r\u00e9p\u00e9tez!\u201d Classic miserable lines \u2022 \u201cGavroche, my darling child, to think you nearly got left behind.\u201d Beautifully sneered by Colman. \u2022 \u201cAre you the felon Jean Valjean?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of Jean Valjean.\u201d Sometimes it felt like a competition to say \u201cJean Valjean\u201d as often as possible. And why not? If you get to win Jean Valjean as a prize, I\u2019m in. \u2022 \u201cThis is a holy house of women. No man can enter.\u201d Translation: \u201cNormally we wouldn\u2019t let any men in. But I have noticed that you are Dominic West. Please come in.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
