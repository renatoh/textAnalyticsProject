Clinton continued: \u201cBecause of both president and Mrs Reagan, in particular Mrs Reagan, we started a national conversation when before nobody would talk about it, nobody wanted to do anything about it, and that, too, is something that I really appreciate. With her very effective, low-key advocacy \u2026 it penetrated the public conscience and people began to say: \u2018Hey, we have to do something about this too.\u2019\u201d As controversy began to swirl over her comments, the Democratic frontrunner issued a swift apology: Her comments in the interview flew in the face of how many longtime gay rights activists view the Reagans \u2013 as a couple who deliberately turned a blind eye to the Aids crisis, with devastating and deadly consequences. Advocates in the San Francisco Bay Area \u2013 who survived the epidemic and had watched friends and loved ones die in great numbers \u2013 consider the Reagans, through their inaction, responsible for the death of thousands of LGBT people. As the Guardian recounted in a history of the Reagans\u2019 dark legacy on HIV, the Reagan administration long refused to take seriously growing concerns in the LGBT community about the disease. Dr Marcus Conant, a clinical professor of dermatology emeritus at UC San Francisco and one of the first physicians to diagnose and treat Aids, recalled the Reagans\u2019 dismissal of his concerns. In one meeting, Reagan\u2019s representative brushed aside claims about the infectious disease, Conant recalled: \u201cHer response was [that] this was a legal problem, not a medical problem,\u201d Conant said. Simply because of who gay men with Aids were and who their sexual partners were, the representative told him, \u201cthese people were breaking the law\u201d, apparently a reference to anti-sodomy laws of the time. Recent reports have shed light on many examples of this insensitive and harmful response. The administration laughed at victims and Nancy Reagan herself turned her back on Rock Hudson, a close friend, when he implored the White House to help him as he was dying from an Aids-related illness. Gay rights activists said they were shocked by Clinton\u2019s comments Friday. Cleve Jones, a longtime San Francisco activist, who created the Aids Memorial Quilt, wrote on Facebook: \u201cHillary Clinton is praising Ronald and Nancy Reagan for \u201cstarting a national conversation\u201d about HIV/AIDS. Utter bullshit. Disgusting. Really, just stop it.\u201d Clinton has secured a number of endorsements from high-profile LGBT groups \u2013 but they haven\u2019t yet directly weighed in on the controversy. Chad Griffin, president of LGBT nonprofit Human Rights Campaign, which is backing Clinton, tweeted, \u201cWhile I respect her advocacy on issues like stem cell &amp; Parkinson\u2019s research, Nancy Reagan was, sadly, no hero in the fight against HIV/AIDS.\u201d Charles Kaiser, author of The Gay Metropolis: The Landmark History of Gay Life in America, said, \u201cThis is shameful, idiotic, false \u2013 and heartbreaking. There is nothing else to say about it.\u201d As she continues her primary battle with Bernie Sanders, Clinton has attempted to overcome what critics see as her own questionable legacy on gay rights, with opponents noting her very recent support of marriage equality and Bill Clinton\u2019s passage of the Defense of Marriage Act, which barred federal recognition of same-sex marriages."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
