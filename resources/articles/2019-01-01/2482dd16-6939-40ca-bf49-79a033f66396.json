The Premier League leaders have suffered back-to-back defeats for the first time this season. Manchester City ended Liverpool\u2019s unbeaten league campaign before Wolves knocked them out of the FA Cup, although the manager insists there is no cause for alarm or inquests into the difficult start to 2019. Klopp said: \u201cYou don\u2019t lose a game in the first part of the season and then lose your head. That would be strange. That would be bad and in general not the right thing to do. This is a moment where your team could sit in the dressing room and really think: \u2018Is he mad?\u2019 because it was not that bad. We talk about Man City and it was what, 11mm? Not a lot from getting a point and a brilliant result. Then we go to Wolves and I make the changes. That says more about me than the team, so let\u2019s carry on. It\u2019s a normal situation, it\u2019s still very positive. \u201cIf you point the finger then it becomes even bigger. There\u2019s no reason for doing it. Nothing happened, each team in the world can lose at Man City. We spoke about why, what we did, what happened and what we could have done better of course, but that\u2019s how we do it always. \u201cIt\u2019s only people who are insecure who would say we are going in completely the other direction and have lost belief. We have to prove it [that is not the case] on the pitch again.\u201d Klopp has won only eight of his 26 matches in January as the Liverpool manager but insists there is no recurring problem. \u201cI don\u2019t see a specific reason for that,\u201d he said. \u201cSo far we\u2019ve lost one Premier League game in January and that was Manchester City away. That\u2019s not a sign of a bad record in January. It\u2019s just a sign of a really difficult game. I\u2019ve never felt bad in January. It\u2019s just that December is a tough month to go through for all of us.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
