The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, accused them of lying and attempting to manipulate the media after Conservative sources claimed on Monday afternoon that the adviser to the health secretary had been hit by a protester at Leeds General infirmary during a campaign visit. Aides initially briefed that Hancock\u2019s adviser had been \u201cpunched in the face\u201d and tried to point the finger at a Labour \u201cthug\u201d. But a video emerged that appeared to show the adviser walking into a protester\u2019s arm. Having seen that footage, aides were forced to acknowledge that it looked like the adviser was hit in the face accidentally, but still tried to turn the story on Labour by claiming the activists\u2019 behaviour and language had been unacceptable. Hancock had been visiting the hospital as the Tories struggled to get to grips with damaging reports about their running of the NHS after the Daily Mirror printed a picture of a child lying on a ward floor because of a shortage of beds. \u201cThe Tories are so desperate to distract from a four-year-old boy sleeping on a hospital floor because of their cuts to our NHS that, once again, they have resorted to bare-faced lying. This is a new low and the Conservative party has serious questions to answer,\u201d said a Labour spokesperson. And McDonnell tweeted: \u201cJohnson and the Tories lie and they cheat to manipulate the media. A sick child treated on the floor of a hospital and they try divert attention with a dead cat lie story. Never has our politics sunk so low in our country since Johnson took over.\u201d West Yorkshire police later said they were \u201cunaware of any reports\u201d of an incident involving election campaigners at the hospital. A source who was present at the time said they had seen no sign of the incident described by Tory aides. \u201cI saw no punch at all. I was there,\u201d said the source, who did not want to be named. The incident happened as Hancock was leaving the hospital after visiting senior staff to talk about the case of four-year-old Jack Williment-Barr. They were heckled with people shouting: \u201cShame on you\u201d, \u201cWe do not want you in this country\u201d and \u201cYou are not welcome in this hospital\u201d as they both walked to a waiting car. Earlier in the day the prime minister cancelled an election visit as protesters gathered at the venue near Bolton. And he faced accusations that he lacked empathy after he repeatedly declined to look at a picture of Williment-Barr when shown it on a reporter\u2019s phone during an interview with ITV News. Instead, Johnson took the phone and put it in his pocket, before returning it when the reporter made clear what he had just done on camera. The aide to the health secretary has not responded to a request for comment.
