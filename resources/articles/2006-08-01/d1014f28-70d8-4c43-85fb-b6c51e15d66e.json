Differing dialects occur, of course: tonalities and rhythmic structures that seem accessible to some but baffling to others. Nevertheless, music is an art form that speaks powerfully to disparate people from all parts of the globe. The annual Proms season in London's Royal Albert Hall has aimed, laudably, to reflect this universality. In recent years its programmes have represented increasingly diverse cultures and ages in music (though neglecting, for some reason, to correct the woeful underrepresentation of female composers and conductors). But some things are hard to change, and the Last Night of the Proms, being one of them, has remained resolutely entrenched in its format. On this evening dialects are swept aside for a splendidly British accent, as one of the most widely watched events in classical music - which advertises itself as \"watched and listened to by an audience of many millions around the globe\" - brings nationalism to centre stage. It is odd that a series of such grand cultural ambition, musical creativity and eclecticism should devote its finale to such rampantly unashamed jingoism. In 1990 the conductor Mark Elder challenged this emphasis when he was due to conduct the Last Night. Mooting the possibility that such songs as Rule Britannia and Land of Hope and Glory might be a touch ill-judged in light of the current Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and international climate, he was promptly vetoed and ousted by the powers that be. Leonard Slatkin fared better when he managed to remove the more traditional songs after 9/11, but the next year they were promptly reinstated with the ease of a temporarily slipped crown. Bob Geldof and Bono, meanwhile, self-appointed global ambassadors for pop and rock music, have taken rather a different tack in musical party-giving. Through events such as Live 8 they have demonstrated the considerable powers of music to bring people together, evoking impulses of compassion and generosity on a global scale. And their most celebrated and watched events have been geared towards changing the world for the better. Even if one is cynical about their motivations, they have succeeded in pulling off some of the greatest charitable publicity stunts in history through the voice of music. This is not just about the failure of classical music to live up to a label of cool. That, surely, has already been demonstrated lamentably enough in its lame-duck imitation of the pop world's marketing strategies. What this is also about is the failure of classical music to engage with the wider world, to identify itself with the problems and preoccupations of ordinary people. Does this Last Night indulgence in public-school jingoism really reflect the tastes of the average classical music lover, or is it helping sustain the reputation that keeps such music, frozen but uncool, closeted in the dark ages? For the very label of anachronism that classical music might wish to avoid is here being perpetuated. It is the insularity of our lives that music helps us transcend. And on this night, listened to by millions around the globe while the Middle East rages, we continue to celebrate our home-bred insularity. Few people would wish to kill the joy that music can inspire, and it would be a shame to dampen the spirits of this evening. But with a bit of imagination there are, surely, all manner of other ways in which they could be raised. It is important to celebrate music, to recognise its potential to unite humanity, to help us understand the universality of our feelings. And the world is changing. We are changing. Perhaps it is time for the Last Night of the Proms to change too. \u00b7 Philippa Ibbotson is a freelance violinist; the Last Night of the Proms is on September 9 pip@ibbotson39.fsnet.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
