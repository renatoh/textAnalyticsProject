Congr\u00e8s was defined by the Fruti\u00e8re dictionary as: \"the practice of coitus ordered by decree of an ecclesiastical judge, performed in the presence of surgeons and matrons, to discover whether a man is potent, with a view to dissolving a marriage.\" The reason it was scrapped had, of course, nothing to do with public decency. Rather it was because the authorities belatedly came to realise that the exercise did not elicit conclusive proof of impotence. \"Our organs do not always obey us when we would like them to, still less so in front of judges,\" blubbed one contemporary, as quoted in Nina Epton's delicious 1959 opus Love and the French. Whatever about Bordeaux, the pressure of public scrutiny certainly didn't perturb Chelsea, on whom most European eyes surely were. A dominant first half display indicated that the favourites tag does not weigh particularly heavily on them, and that Phil Scolari's lack of experience in the Champions League is no barrier either. Stiffer challenges than Bordeaux await, of course, but Chelsea were certainly more convincing tonight than they were against Rosenborg this time last season. Then again, all that really suggests is that Scolari is at least as comfortable in this tournament as another novice was last season \u2013 Avram Grant. The absence of a proper challenge from Bordeaux seemed to bore Chelsea, who lapsed into indifference in the second half. This probably irritated English spectators but it should have given them cause for gratitude. Because the sight of last season's Ligue 1 runners-up being effortlessly crushed by the team who finished second in the Premier League should have shut up any English people who whinge about the abundance of foreigners plying their trade over here. Instead, those people should count their blessings: specifically the number of top English players that play in this country. If the money were elsewhere, English fans would wind up watching teams such as Bordeaux every week. Frank Lampard and Joe Cole wouldn't be regularly scoring at the Bridge, but in the Nou Camp, the Allianz Arena or - who knows? - even the Home Depot Center. Michel Platini was the only member of the French Euro '84 squad who played his club football outside his homeland (indeed, only one of eight finalists had more than two players who played for clubs outside their own country). Now all the best French players play abroad, or will do once Karim Benzema leaves Lyon, as he inevitably will before he reaches his prime. Former Lyon goalkeeper Gregory Coupet said last season that Ligue 1 is \"the best youth league in Europe\" and he's right in the sense that it continues to produce exquisite young players. The problem is these are quickly lured away to wealthier lands. So French clubs are now staffed by promising novices who'll soon be snapped up, cut-price imports who'll also be snapped up if they excel (as Chelsea's Petr Cech, Michael Essien or Didier Drogba could confirm) or returned exiles who'll emigrate again given the chance \u2013 thus the spine of Bordeaux's team tonight was Souleymane Diawara, who flopped at Charlton, Alou Diarra, who didn't get a single first-team game for Liverpool during five seasons at Anfield, and Yoan Gourcouff, who's a more ingenious player than he was able to show tonight but is only back in France on loan from AC Milan. If Cole and Lampard's starring role should convince Englanders to be thankful for what they've got, Florent Malouda and Nicolas Anelka's second-half goals will have deepened the sense of loss for French fans and anyone else who yearns for the days when European football was more balanced."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
