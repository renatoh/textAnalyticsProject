When I finally sent my second novel off to my weary editors this week, I understood why. There is something about the energy of the music that I need to keep me amped up through one of the most arduous and solitary processes I\u2019ve experienced. If I\u2019m writing an emotional scene that\u2019s forcing me to turn deep into myself, I\u2019ll put a slow, introspective song on repeat (usually \u201cThe Essence\u201d by Giggs). If I\u2019m writing a big explosive scene (in my second novel I have one whole chapter that is just a heated argument between five people) I\u2019ll listen to the most frenzied, charged track I can think of. And all of these music choices are subconscious, I realised. What I love most about this particular genre of music isn\u2019t just the bass that makes my flat shake (sorry neighbours) it\u2019s the storytelling. And it\u2019s the double entendres that I catch and rewind over and over again, in awe of the wordplay. Two legends in the game, D Double E and Frisco, released albums (Double or Nothing and The Familiar Stranger, respectively) while I was in the last stretch of writing, and I had these on repeat, keeping me company and driving me forward, while I was crawling towards the finish line. It\u2019s a cultural crossover that few might expect, but to me, now it makes total sense."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
