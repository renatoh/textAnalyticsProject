Two were shot and killed - one of them a teenager who had climbed on top of an armoured vehicle, Palestinians said. Near Tulkarem, two Palestinians were killed when their car crashed after running an Israeli army roadblock, Israel Radio reported. The military has not commented on the deaths. Israel Radio reported that Israeli forces entered the town before sundown and were conducting searches for suspected militants. Palestinians said soldiers tried to capture Tarek Zaghal, a leader of the al-Aqsa Brigades militia, affiliated with Yasser Arafat's Fatah group. He was wounded but escaped, they said. Violence that has persisted for two years shows no signs of abating, despite efforts by the United States, Europe and others to mediate a truce. Israel has controlled most of the main West Bank population centres since an incursion in mid-June, a response to Palestinian suicide bomb attacks inside Israel. Curfews are in force much of the time, confining hundreds of thousands of people to their homes. Palestinians said a 15-year-old boy was shot and killed when he climbed on top of an Israeli armoured vehicle in central Tulkarem. After an incident in which Palestinian youths climbed onto a tank, stole equipment and threw a firebomb, the military warned that soldiers would shoot at the attackers in similar circumstances in the future. Another Palestinian, a night watchman, was shot dead at his post in front of a building, Palestinians said. Tulkarem is on the line between Israel and the West Bank, 18 miles west of the Palestinian city of Nablus and nine miles east of the Israeli coastal city of Netanya. In Nablus, about 100 Palestinians demonstrated against the protracted Israeli occupation. A woman was hurt when soldiers opened fire, Palestinians said. The army had no comment. In the Gaza Strip, Israeli soldiers exchanged fire with armed Palestinians who were apparently trying to infiltrate into the Jewish settlement of Kfar Darom, settlers said. Israel Radio reported that two Palestinians entered an abandoned building sometimes used as a post by Israeli soldiers. It was empty at the time, and soldiers surrounded the structure after the infiltration, the radio said. In the village of Al Khader, outside Bethlehem, Israeli special forces arrested Abdel Mahdi Ramadan, a leader of the al-Aqsa group. Mr Ramadan was responsible for organising attacks inside Israel, the army said. At least 19 Palestinians were arrested in other West Bank locations, the military said. A top Hamas activist was detained in Hebron, Palestinians said. Etti Galia, a Jewish mother of seven who was killed in a Palestinian ambush in the West Bank, was buried today at Kochav Hashachar, the Jewish settlement in which she lived, east of Ramallah. Galia, 48, was killed as she drove home last night."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
