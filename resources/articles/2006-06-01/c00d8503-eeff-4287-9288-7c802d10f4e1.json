A tricky one because, beyond the photo opportunities offered by sitting in the front row of a show, most celebrities don't actually care about fashion. Whereas the rest of us base our shopping decisions on the aesthetics of the clothing itself, celebrities, with the sort of self-obsession only 20 years of cocaine and/or Scientology can bestow, make it all about themselves, and merely ask, will this make me look thinner/taller/browner? This makes shopping enviably simple. None of that faffing over that patterned dress, since as a wised-up celebrity, you know that patterns are a one-way ticket to hell, aka the latter half of Fashion Hits &amp; Misses. From this same well springs the crux of my complaint. Magazines have put the fear of God into celebrities and the boot into swan dresses. Thus Oscar fashion round-ups have become increasingly bland: it's hard to conjure up much scintillating prose about yet another long pastel dress. It is also why a celebrity's inexplicable longevity often has a direct correlation to the dullness of their wardrobe, despite their increasingly dire careers, as demonstrated by the icon of safe dressing, Jennifer Aniston. Those boring dresses buttress them against the slings and arrows of critical sneers, and guarantee their continuing fawned-over presence in magazines. But celebrities aren't immune to trends. They just pick those that suit their criteria which means for this summer, respectively, oversized bags (thinness), shorts with high heels (tallness), and white dresses (brownness.) Yes, folks, this summer's fashion icon is an attenuated Oompa Loompa."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
