Researchers at the University of New South Wales said their DNA sampling project showed between 9% and 23% of the \u201cwild dogs\u201d in the state had only dingo ancestry, challenging a notion that most dingo populations had died out. Less than 1% of the DNA samples taken from dogs killed in management practices, mostly to protect livestock, had no dingo ancestry at all. Lead author of the study Dr Kylie Cairns, of the University of New South Wales and a scientific advisor to the Australian Dingo Foundation, said there was a belief that NSW no longer had \u201creal dingo\u201d populations. \u201cWe find that\u2019s not the case.\u201d In the study, published in the journal Conservation Genetics, Cairns and colleagues analysed samples from 783 dogs caught on public lands between 1996 and 2012. NSW classifies wild dogs as a pest animal and most of the controls focus on protecting livestock using poisons. Dogs are also trapped and shot. Guard animals are also used. Laws in NSW compel landholders to control \u201cwild dogs\u201d and \u201cto take measures to prevent, minimise or eliminate the risk as far as is reasonably practicable\u201d. Dingoes are Australia\u2019s only native canid and have been in the country for about 5,000 years. Prof Mike Letnic, a co-author of the study, said dingoes were subject to a \u201cterrible dilemma\u201d, saying: \u201cLike the kangaroo, they can be pests \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean we should wipe them out. \u201cWith the kangaroo, there is a balance between how we control and try to conserve them. We\u2019re worried that with the dingo there\u2019s not a great deal of balance \u2013 the emphasis is largely on exterminating them. \u201cThere are still quite a few pure dingoes out there, and almost no dogs. We need to take efforts to look after the remaining populations. They are valuable.\u201d The researchers identified three hotspots in Port Macquarie, Myall Lakes and the Washpool National Park, all in north-east NSW, where there were more pure dingos than expected. Brad Nesbitt, an adjunct researcher at the University of New England, who also worked on the study, said the focus on wild dogs had been to protect livestock producers but there was no plan that looked to protect dingo populations. Cairns said: \u201cWe need to consider our terminology because calling them wild dogs is misleading. We also need a better balance between conservation and protecting livestock.\u201d \u201cYes, they eat sheep and they have an impact on farmers,\u201d she said, but helping farmers to explore other control methods like electric fencing, or protective livestock animals, could help preserve the dingo population while helping farmers. She added: \u201cWhen they talk about conservation, they say dingo. But when it\u2019s management, they talk about wild dogs.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
