It aims to deliver exceptional service quality by understanding what matters to patients, setting its service goals based on that understanding, setting a work plan to make it happen, measuring the right things to track delivery and acting quickly on the data. It understands that what matters to patients are consistency and co-ordination of care, being treated with respect and dignity, cleanliness and pain control. Everyone in the trust is focused on this approach, from the directors to the ward staff. Measurement is carried out through a wide range of techniques from major surveys to interviewing 400 patients every month. This includes asking questions such as: \"Did you have enough time to discuss your health or medical problem with the doctor? Did the doctor explain the reasons for any treatment or action in a way you could understand? Did you have confidence and trust in the doctor examining and treating you?\" Results are published on the intranet for each individual consultant. Swaths of detailed data are given to the public. Scores for aspects of care such as dignity and service co-ordination rose significantly in 15 months. There has been a strong focus on supporting patients with dementia. Christine Bryden explains why dignified care makes a profound difference to her quality of life. \"As we become more emotional and less cognitive, it's the way you talk to us, not what you say, that we will remember,\" she says. \"We know the feeling but do not know the plot. Your smile, your laugh, your touch are what we will connect with. We're still here in emotion and spirit \u2013 if only you could find us.\" University Hospitals Birmingham NHS foundation trust It runs an award-winning project called Dignity for All. It includes a lead dignity team, 390 dignity champions and dignity clinical educators. It reports to the trust board. There are champions on every ward and department. They volunteer and are trained for the role, and then support cascade training in their part of the trust. Events, newsletters and mentors maintain quality, motivation and momentum. The campaign is built on listening and learning from patient experience. Champions are encouraged to speak out about their concerns and celebrate successes, and they are supported to make small changes that make a difference to patient dignity. The dignity programme includes the Behind Closed Doors campaign, which pushes the message that whatever a person's age and physical ability, they should, wherever possible, be able to choose to use the toilet in private. One of the most obvious changes is the way mealtimes are managed. Patients are encouraged to eat round a table with others, reducing isolation and helping people to stay active. \u2022 Taken from Delivering Dignity: Securing dignity in care for older people in hospitals and care homes"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
