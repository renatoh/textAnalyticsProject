This is not down to Judge John Deed, nor is it simply the result of wanting to do good deeds. At university I studied philosophy of law, and various family members thought I was destined for wig-wearing debate in a courtroom. So I spent a summer in chambers following barristers about. It was fun, but I never did the conversion course. Instead I watched legal dramas, read John Grisham and became addicted to Ally McBeal. I waited for my call-up to jury service. And waited. Then, realising that I'd never met anyone who'd been called up, and that no one in my family had ever done it - even my octogenarian father, who has lived at his current address for 60 years - I forgot all about it. In the midst of pre-Christmas madness, I sifted through the meagre pile of good mail - a few cards and invites - and ignored the bills, tax returns and other brown envelopes. It was only in the last week of term, preparing to evacuate for the fortnight, that I revisited the bad mail. To my amazement, one of my \"bills\" was a jury summons to appear in the cream of local courts in January. At any stage of my career before teaching it would have been a doddle to leave work for a few weeks. Other people could take over; I was dispensable. I know teachers are supposed to be dispensable, too, but the timing has been harsh. We have a residential trip that was planned and booked last summer. My class, for five nights in the countryside, learning to survive in fresh air and wide open spaces without TV and computer games. As class teacher, it is unthinkable for me not to lead it. The long-awaited jury service comes second. The plan is to take a letter to court requesting that I am given a short case and that I can be released back in school for the trip. I hope the wigs buy it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
