It\u2019s made for some sticky pitches and the kind of ponderous football not even Jos\u00e9 Mourinho would be proud of. Mind you, with the thermometer set to reach a sizzling 41C (105.8F) in Ismailia when Cameroon kick off against Guinea Bissau later on, it\u2019s a sorry farce that matches are being played at all. It\u2019s the first tournament that has been held in summer after organisers could no longer bear listening to the loud and prolonged whinging noises emanating from Europe over the loss of players every other winter, so they gave in and voted to shift it. So much for player welfare! And the result is that only the weather has threatened to set the tournament alight so far, with favourites Egypt grinding out just a 1-0 win against Zimbabwe, Ivory Coast beating South Africa by a single goal in a Cairo sweatbox and second favourites, Nigeria, winning a war of attrition with Burundi thanks to a goal from 2016\u2019s Odion Ighalo. It\u2019s like watching George Graham\u2019s Arsenal on repeat! Oh Afcon, how could you! Understandably, the race for the Golden Boot is not shaping up to be a classic. Just the 20 players share the lead on one goal apiece and not one of them is Mo Salah. But The Fiver\u2019s going to wager that things will get a lot spicier on Tuesday when Ghana come to town. The Black Stars have had a completely normal buildup to a major tournament, with level-headed former Sunderland legend Asamaoah Gyan retiring after learning he was to be stripped of the captaincy only to make a rapid U-turn when the country\u2019s supreme leader, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, got on the blower and told him to pick up the toys he had just thrown out of his pram and get on the first flight to Cairo. \u201cA presidential request is one that cannot be disregarded,\u201d sniffed Gyan. He\u2019s since been given the not-at-all-just-made-up-on-the-spot role of \u2018general captain\u2019 by manager Kwesi Appiah, who has handed the regular on-pitch armband to West Ham legend Andr\u00e9 Ayew. The Fiver\u2019s fully expecting combustion in Egypt, with or without the additional agitator of intense heat. Not that Appiah is bothered, he\u2019s used to off-field nonsense. \u201cThe captaincy is nothing,\u201d he shrugged, in the buildup to their opener against Benin. \u201cThe most important thing is to have unity in the camp. I think this is the best camp I have ever witnessed in my six or eight camps with the national team.\u201d It\u2019s a low bar. The Fiver\u2019s backing Ghana to bring some much-needed drama to Afcon but in the searing heat, it will probably be off the pitch.

QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cNone of the officials hired me saying what happens to me depends on what I do in the Copa Am\u00e9rica. Because if they had then I wouldn\u2019t have taken the job. I\u2019m not handing over my post. If they want to fire them, then fire me. Another coach will come in and the same things will happen, they are asking for results when we can\u2019t provide them. Let\u2019s see who explodes first\u201d \u2013 Hern\u00e1n G\u00f3mez gets his fresh funk on after Ecuador crashed out of the tournament. RECOMMENDED LOOKING David Squires goes there. FIVER LETTERS \u201cI was horrified to read in Big Paper that 37% of British international rugby players and 43% of England cricketers were privately educated, compared with just 5% of international footballers. This outrageous inequality must be corrected immediately by focusing all efforts to Stop Football in the state school sector\u201d \u2013 Tim Cole. \u201cIt\u2019s not really football but this is quite a first three paragraphs for a Big Paper obituary. Norman Stone v Jos\u00e9 Mourinho (in his first Chelsea tenure prime) would have been box office\u201d \u2013 Noble Francis. \u201cBy Dutch standards, Aloysius Paulus van Gaal is nothing special (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters). Pretty boring actually compared to Brighton\u2019s Davy Petrus Wenceslaus Henri Pr\u00f6pper\u201d \u2013 Niels Hermanus Johannes Bartels. \u201cRe: nominative determinism (Fiver letters passim). At the recent Global Water Summit hosted in London, there was a speaker called Lee King\u201d \u2013 Graham Ward. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Former South Yorkshire police chief David Duckenfield will face a retrial on a charge of gross negligence manslaughter over the deaths of 96 people at the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough in 1989.

Megan Rapinoe reckons France v USA! USA!! USA!!! in the World Cup quarter-final will be \u201cwild and crazy\u201d, but just hopefully not in the England v Cameroon way. \u201cThis is incredible for the women\u2019s game,\u201d she yee-hawed. \u201cYou have two heavy-hitters meeting. I hope the fans are crazy, there is tons of media around it and it is just a big spectacle.\u201d Fun and games in South America dept. Bury owner Steve Dale has offered to settle some \u2013 but not all \u2013 of the Shakers\u2019 debts, meaning the newly-promoted club are likely to start life in League One on -12 points. And Rotherham have broken their transfer record by splurging \u00a3500,000 on Plymouth striker Freddie Ladapo. \u201cThey sold me a dream of coming here and doing well,\u201d he cheered.
