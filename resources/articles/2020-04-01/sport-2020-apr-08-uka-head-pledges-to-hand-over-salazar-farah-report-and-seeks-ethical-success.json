Joanna Coates was addressing the row between UK Anti-Doping and UKA, following the latter\u2019s refusal to hand over the internal report which is said to contain sensitive medical data. \u201cThere are definitely plans to hand it over,\u201d insisted Coates, who said UKA was not trying to delay the process but simply adhering to \u201ccertain processes and certain elements of confidentiality\u201d that have to be upheld before the the information can be released. \u201cWe are an organisation that has been highly criticised for not following process and on this occasion we are absolutely following process and we\u2019re still being criticised.\u201d Coates also said there was a need for stronger leadership at UKA following revelations in a review by the sports barrister John Mehrzad of the organisation\u2019s dealings with Salazarthat the former performance director Neil Black and the head of endurance, Barry Fudge, both threatened to quit if the board cut its ties with the American coach. Black left UKA in October, his exit due in no small part to his support of Salazar and his failure to hit medal targets at the World Athletics Championships. Fudge remains in his role. \u201cPerformance cannot dictate a business, that\u2019s how I feel,\u201d Coates said. \u201cMajor decisions should be made at an executive level and people should understand what\u2019s happening in their business. We will be reviewing the entire organisation and seeing if people are fit for purpose to drive this business forward. I don\u2019t want to name particular people because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to do that.\u201d Coates said that while she has some concerns, she is hopeful none of Salazar\u2019s methods have been adopted by other coaches or athletes governed by UKA. \u201cWe have been reviewed and audited and reviewed again in so many different areas of the business that I truly hope that there are no skeletons in the cupboard,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have an opportunity to write a strategy for the organisation based on very clear behaviour that I want to see exhibited. If there are people in the organisation that don\u2019t feel that plan is right and don\u2019t exhibit those behaviours then we will remove them.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
