EU finance ministers on a video conference call struck a deal late on Thursday after the Netherlands shifted on a demand for \u201ceconomic surveillance\u201d of countries benefiting from \u20ac240bn of credit lines via the European stability mechanism, a bailout fund for struggling member states. Italy and Spain have in turn accepted a delay on agreement on so-called \u201ccoronabonds\u201d that would allow member states to raise funds on the same terms from the financial markets. The issue of a \u201crecovery fund\u201d yet to be fleshed out will be put to the EU\u2019s heads of state and government at a future summit. Italy\u2019s finance minister, Roberto Gualtieri, told reporters: \u201cWe have put on the table of the European Council a recovery fund enabling common debt issuance. Off the table is any conditionality on the use of European stability mechanism financing. Now it\u2019s up to the leaders to take the right decisions.\u201d The Dutch finance minister, Wopke Hoekstra, said a \u201csensible\u201d deal had been reached. Bailout funds would still come with conditions if the cash was spent on the wider economy rather than a response to the immediate crisis, the minister insisted. Hoekstra tweeted: \u201cThe [European stability mechanism] can provide financial help to countries without conditions for medical expenses. It will also be available for economic support, but with conditions. That\u2019s fair and reasonable. \u201cWe are and will remain opposed to Eurobonds. We think this concept will not help Europa or [Netherlands] in the long term.\u201d Agreement was also found on boosting the lending capacity of the European Investment Bank and a new \u20ac100billion scheme proposed by the European Commission to keep fund employee\u2019s salaries if they are put on reduced hours. The finance ministers had faced growing pressure to come to agreement after 16 hours of talks since Tuesday. Early on Thursday, the Italian prime minster Giuseppe Conte had added to the tension by claiming that it was an existential issue for the EU. \u201cIt\u2019s a big challenge to the existence of Europe,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cIf Europe fails to come up with a monetary and financial policy adequate for the biggest challenge since world war two, not only Italians but European citizens will be deeply disappointed.\u201d The start of the latest round of discussions of the finance ministers had been repeatedly delayed on Thursday as the main protagonists, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany and France sought to find a way forward between themselves. Ahead of the full meeting of finance ministers, M\u00e1rio Centeno, the Portuguese finance minister who is president of the Eurozone group, insisted the EU needed to build a financial safety net as Europe \u201cdipped into recession\u201d with \u201call in lockdown, casualties rising by the hour and with no end in sight\u201d. \u201cWe either sink or swim together\u201d, Centeno had said as he called on ministers to show the \u201cnecessary spirit of compromise\u201d. Following agreement, Centeno told the ministers: \u201cWe acted decisively for our citizens in less than a month\u201d. The negotiations on the EU\u2019s fiscal response to the epidemic exposed deep divisions between north and south, and reignited feelings of bitter enmity last experienced during the financial crisis. The Dutch government with the support of Germany, Finland and Austria, led rejection of the central demand of the Italian government for \u201ccoronabonds\u201d which would involve all EU member states borrowing from the markets on the same terms. The issuing of joint bonds would create joint liability and make borrowing more expensive for the wealthier northern member states as it cheapens it for the rest, at a time when the gap between German and Italian bonds is rising. The Dutch parliament has backed its government on its approach, with politicians warning that anti-EU sentiment would be inflated in the wealthier member states as well if the electorate concluded that their money was being misspent. Austria\u2019s finance minister, Gernot Bl\u00fcmel, said the Netherlands had not been standing alone. \u201cThat is out of the question for us,\u201d he said of the issuing of coronabonds. \u201cThat remains the case. We were also not in favour of this formulation because the idea opens the door to a mutualisation of debt ... It was not just the Netherlands.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
