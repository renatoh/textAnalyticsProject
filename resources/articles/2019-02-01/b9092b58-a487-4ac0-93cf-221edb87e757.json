We can play better and we should play better but even if it is not a dream result it is still a good one. Bayern are a very good team and though our performance was not perfect we still have a result we can work with. Nil-nil is the best home draw you can get, after all. \u201cWe have three weeks until the second leg, and I think day by day this result will start to look better for us. First, though, we must return our concentration to the Premier League, because we play Manchester United next and they are obviously in good shape.\u201d Bayern are likely to have Leon Goretzka and Arjen Robben back for the second leg and Niko Kovac believes home advantage will work in his side\u2019s favour. \u201cWe know what we have to do and in Germany we will be playing in front of 75,000,\u201d the Bayern manager said. \u201cIt is a pity we could not score but we kept everything tight at the back and got what we wanted from the game. Liverpool are a sensational side and I don\u2019t remember many European opponents not conceding at Anfield.\u201d What appeared to be a confrontation between managers at the final whistle turned out to be no more than a misunderstanding over handshake protocol. \u201cIn Germany we go to the players first,\u201d Kovac explained. \u201cIt was nothing,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cI wanted to do it immediately, so I waited and he apologised.\u201d The Liverpool captain, Jordan Henderson, insists his side can still travel to Germany with belief. \u201cThis is not the worst result in the world, we\u2019ve kept a clean sheet and we can be confident still,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can go over there and hurt them.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
