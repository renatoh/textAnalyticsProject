The officers, their peaked brown hats neatly lined up on trestle tables, are on the lookout for any signs of trouble between rival motorbike taxi gangs after carnage erupted in this pocket of the city on Saturday when a brutal fight broke out between two groups of drivers. Dozens of drivers bludgeoned each other with knives and batons. Handguns were fired and two men \u2013 20-year-old delivery bike driver Weerawat Phuengkhut and 33-year-old motorbike taxi driver Watcharin Ngamchalao \u2013 were shot dead. Police veterans say it was the bloodiest motorbike taxi driver battle they have seen in Thailand\u2019s capital. They also acknowledge that, with the arrival of ride-hailing apps escalating Bangkok\u2019s taxi turf wars, reports of violence among drivers have surged. A growing turf war The fight on Saturday took place between two groups registered with Bangkok\u2019s Department of Land Transport (DLT). According to one witness, the violence broke out because the gangs occupied customer pickup points that were too close for comfort. \u201cThey had problems for a while \u2026 then it exploded,\u201d says Boonmee Chaleamboon, 49, a moto taxi driver who saw the battle. \u201cI thought it was a normal fight. Then I heard gunshots.\u201d Chaleamboon, who earns about 600 baht (\u00a315) a day, has become used to seeing \u201cnormal fights\u201d during his 20 years as a driver. Many of the 8.3 million people living in Bangkok rely on motorbike taxis to zip them between gridlocked cars, and competition for riders often gets heated. As of last month there were 104,134 recognised motorcycle taxis in the city, working from nearly 6,000 official pickup spots. But the competition \u2013 and violence \u2013 between moto taxi drivers has increased since October 2017, when the Uber-like ride-hailing app Grab launched in Thailand. Grab fares undercut local operators, with short rides for as little as 40 baht (\u00a31): sometimes half that of street-hailed bikes. Other ride-hail apps including Indonesia\u2019s Get have launched in Thailand but Grab, founded in Malaysia in 2012, has become the most popular. Now, there are two moto taxi factions facing off in Bangkok. Many DLT-registered drivers resent Grab drivers undercutting them, and technically operating illegally as \u201cprivate\u201d vehicles. While Grab drivers were not involved in the fight on Saturday, stories of attacks against them have been appearing regularly in Thai news and social media. In March a Grab driver suffered an enormous shoulder gash during a tussle over territory. This month, another was knifed in the face. \u201cSometimes attacks don\u2019t make the news,\u201d says Grab driver Pornchai \u201cBoy\u201d Chatchawalamonkul. He is talking to the Guardian in a grimy central Bangkok cafe that has become a hangout spot for between-rides drivers. Chatchawalamonkul, 42, runs a Facebook group where drivers share details of attacks and tips about how to avoid becoming victims, such as using specific side roads. Scrolling through his phone, he points out lists of \u201cred zones\u201d where violent non-app drivers were known to prowl. Earlier that morning he says he helped a Grab driver during an altercation with another driver who was trying to steal his customer. They did this by literally grabbing the bemused passenger from the back of the Grab driver\u2019s moped. Compared with attacks depicted by photos of bloodied faces in Chatchawalamonkul\u2019s Facebook group, it was a tame encounter. Grab tells the Guardian that the safety of its drivers is its top priority. In a statement the company says it tells its drivers they \u201cshould avoid reciprocating, including all forms of violence and physical assaults\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve been constantly communicating to our driver-partners to avoid confrontation when attacked, contact Grab call centre and gather evidence for the police as soon as they can.\u201d \u2018The root of the problem is deep\u2019 Following the widely reported case of a Grab driver being stabbed in the face this month, Thailand\u2019s top police general, Chakthip Chaijinda, said the force needed to be better at preventing similar attacks and promised more effective weapons searches at road checkpoints. Meanwhile, with Grab pushing for the DLT to legalise the service, many of its drivers hope that violence will subside when the app becomes official. \u201cSometimes the drivers confronting me say: \u2018Tell Grab to become legal, so I can join!\u2019\u201d Chatchawalamonkul says. Chaleamboon agreed that relations could improve if this happens, but that longer-established turf wars would likely endure. Gang mentalities were, he explains, reinforced by unofficial \u201cboss\u201d drivers running the best pickup locations, demanding payments in addition to official city fees to share spots. These costs motivate many drivers to fervently defend their territory, which has no legally binding demarcation. Chaleamboon says: \u201cThe root of the problem is deep.\u201d On Thursday night Soi Udomsuk is calm, police having closed the pickup spots that were at the centre of the violence on Saturday. But other pickup places were still operating a stone\u2019s throw up the road. One of them was Chaleamboon\u2019s. His location wasn\u2019t as visible as some nearby, but he has no desire to fight for customers. \u201cYou have to live within the rules,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like the mafia.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
