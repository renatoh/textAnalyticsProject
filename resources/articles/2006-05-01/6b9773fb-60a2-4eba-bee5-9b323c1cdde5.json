At the time no one enjoyed one of England cricket's finest times more than our Fred but it is starting to rankle now so that, when next the question is asked, expect no response save the sight of him banging his head on the table like Basil Fawlty on the way to a breakdown. The trouble is that it is all relevant. Since those halcyon days the milk has curdled somewhat and the coach Duncan Fletcher, outwardly inscrutable behind the camouflage of his wrap-round shades but seething inside no doubt, will be wanting some answers. The fact is that his side, hampered by crucial injuries, have gone off the boil for, having learned the winning habit, they have since mislaid it. The figures do not lie. Since the nail-biter at Trent Bridge that gave them the edge against Australia in the series last year they have played eight Tests and won one, and that a last-ditch victory against the odds, albeit a scintillating one, in Mumbai to finish the recent series against India. There have been three defeats in that time, two of them by Pakistan in a three-match series before Christmas that somehow, through ECB spin the quality of which is unavailable to the selectors, was transmogrified into a success, and one in Mohali. They have been no more impressive in one-day cricket, losing eight of 11 matches played in the same period. This is scarcely the record of a side with ambition to be recognised as indisputable top dog by the end of the year. They suffer badly by comparison with the Australians who, since losing the Ashes, have won seven of the eight Tests they have played, including all three in South Africa, and have lost only seven of 22 one-day internationals, including the extraordinary hyper-scoring match at The Wanderers. Elderly their side may be, with the cracks consistently being papered over, but they know how to take a game by the scruff. It is this that is the worrying aspect for England. Over the years leading up to the Ashes, under the leadership first of Nasser Hussain and then of Michael Vaughan, the side learned first how not to lose, then how to win the games that once in the balance they would have lost. It saw them through at Edgbaston last year and again at Trent Bridge. The first sign that they might just be dwelling on the past came at Multan, when the batting let slip a first-innings position created by the bowlers and then imploded when set a simple target to win. The Mumbai win, exhilarating as it was, had the feel of one of those dead-rubber victories over Australia and was noteworthy more for the way Flintoff motivated a second-string side. The real concern, though, was the manner in which Sri Lanka were allowed to draw a match that by rights should have been finished ruthlessly inside three days. A side's fielding is a reflection of its state of mind and England's catching in that match bordered on the comical. If the slip cordon were in stitches at the sight of Paul Collingwood missing the ninth and last chance on the final day, then they would have been busting a gusset in Sydney and Melbourne. England have little time to claw back their credibility and give the Australians cause to think other than that last summer was an aberration for them and a fluke for England. Against Sri Lanka in the second Test, which begins at Edgbaston today, they will stand or fall on the catching, with Geraint Jones's reported comment that an improvement will allow them to raise two fingers to their critics just crass. If they catch everything with the alacrity of a lizard seeking insects for supper, it will still not airbrush what went on at Lord's. It should, though, enable them to win, provided the weather holds off long enough for the seamers to get to work properly on a pitch that has yet to see Test cricket and is thus an unknown quantity. It was a firework display in November that has prevented the use of the usual strip. A protective covering for the pyrotechnics was insufficient to prevent some damage and subsequent re-seeding has not taken properly because of adverse temperatures. Today's pitch is located to one side of the square towards the raucous atmosphere of the Hollies stand. The pitch was on display briefly yesterday between showers and seems to be well and evenly grassed. The amount of moisture beneath the surface means that seamers ought to dominate proceedings, at least for the first few days, and to this end Flintoff might wish to bowl first, mindful that Ricky Ponting's ill-advised insertion last year came on a different pitch and later in the season. Anyway we do not hark on last year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
