It happened during the Scott inquiry into the sale of weapons to Iraq two decades ago. It happened in the Hutton inquiry into the death of David Kelly after the Iraq war in 2003. Yesterday it happened again, this time in the argument over responsibility for the decision to allow the Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset al-Megrahi to return to Libya. These have each been small victories for open government. But they are battles rather than the war. What is revealed in these brief flashes of floodlight over the inner workings of Whitehall is sometimes more unsavoury than expected, sometimes not as unsavoury as some hoped, and is rarely conclusive, as yesterday's rush of documents illustrated. Yet the main thing to understand is that all these cases have arisen in a similar context \u2013 the moral maze inherent in relations between an established law-based, oil-importing state like Britain and the oppressive but oil-rich regimes of the Arab world. Of course, British government would be a much easier business if these relations did not have to exist. Given that they do, the conflicts of interest are to some degree inescapable. The question is always how to balance them in the least worst way. Yesterday's documents offered no smoking gun for Megrahi case conspiracy theorists. That is not surprising when the documents were volunteered by the London and Edinburgh governments as each tries to pass the ticking parcel of blame to the other. Nevertheless, the documents do not tell the full story of Megrahi's place in the tortuous relationship between the UK, Scotland, the United States and Libya. The papers surrounding Tony Blair's ground-breaking visit to Muammar Gaddafi in 2004 remain under lock and key, as do key US papers and many others on UK-Libyan diplomatic and trade relations since the overthrow of the Libyan monarchy 40 years ago. Parliament has a big inquiry job to do here. The foreign affairs select committee should meet without delay. Nevertheless, the papers confirm that both the UK justice ministry and the Scottish authorities have abided by the law in the Megrahi case. The decision was Scotland's to take and Scotland, not London, took it. Yesterday's releases confirmed that the Foreign Office did not want Megrahi to die in prison and that Jack Straw changed his mind over whether the prisoner transfer agreement with Libya in 2007 should cover the Lockerbie case or not. But the papers do not show that these considerations prevailed over proper process when Kenny MacAskill released Megrahi last month. Mr Straw's February 2008 letter is evidence of Britain's overriding readiness to make deals with Libya, but it makes no concessions about Megrahi, who was released on compassionate grounds not under the transfer agreement. The bottom line is that there is nothing here to show that the Lockerbie bomber has been returned to Libya for the benefit of British oil interests or for some other raison d'\u00e9tat \u2013 though admittedly also nothing to show that he has not. History ensures that relations between Britain and Libya will never be easy. Nevertheless, it is better that they exist and, where possible, are improved than that they do not exist or are needlessly worsened. Yet Megrahi's early release by the Scottish authorities was not essential to that difficult process. That is why, as a general election looms (no such distraction for Colonel Gaddafi), politicians in London and Edinburgh are suddenly playing the blame game. Yesterday's papers were revealing \u2013 but only as far as they went. We now know more about the events that led to the release of a dying man \u2013 but still not the central question of whether the right man was convicted. The losers are not Britain or Libya but, as ever, the families of the bereaved."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
