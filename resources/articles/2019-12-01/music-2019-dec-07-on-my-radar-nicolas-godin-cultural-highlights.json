They formed the electronic music duo Air, releasing their debut album Moon Safari in 1998. Five more studio albums and two soundtracks followed, including a film score for The Virgin Suicides in 1999. Godin released his first solo album, Contrepoint, in 2015; his second, Concrete and Glass, is out on 24 January 2020 on Because Music. 1. Design Charlotte Perriand: Inventing a New World Architecture is a big part of my life: my dad was an architect, and I studied architecture before I started making music. Charlotte Perriand worked and made iconic designs with Le Corbusier. She designed simple things for everyday life \u2013 tables, stools, kitchens \u2013 so you can find her design in a lot of places. There\u2019s a minimalism to her work, but also a playfulness, a lightness. I think this exhibition [at the Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris] is very important, because she was a bit underrated compared with people like Jean Prouv\u00e9, but now she\u2019s getting the praise she always deserved. 2. Nonfiction The Age of Surveillance Capitalism by Shoshana Zuboff Jaron Lanier\u2019s Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now introduced me to the new business model of data and Google and so on. So I dug into all these newspaper and magazine articles, then last weekend I started reading this book. I have to say that it was quite scary, because it details all these new forms of economy that don\u2019t follow rules of any kind. I think everybody should be aware of what\u2019s happening and this book is very good for that: it\u2019s clear and well written and well explained, and it allows you to form your own opinion. 3. Television Watchmen (HBO) There are so many TV shows now but this one is unique: I just finished watching it and it\u2019s very smart. I like it when shows are commercial \u2013 in that they are successful and people watch them \u2013 but at the same time very weird. This one has a lot of strange flashbacks and strange philosophies, but it\u2019s approachable for everybody. I thought the music was really cool, then I saw on the credits that it\u2019s by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, who I\u2019m a big fan of. It\u2019s an amazing soundtrack: it takes possession of you. 4. Music book Phoenix: Libert\u00e9, \u00c9galit\u00e9, Phoenix! (Rizzoli) I love this book for many reasons. I\u2019m part of that movement from the 90s when all these French bands showed up on the scene, so it\u2019s like an old group of friends I\u2019m happy to see 20 years later. Usually books about bands are more like fan books, but this one is a real piece of art. It shows all aspects of life in a band, and how you can achieve a career without losing your essence. They really put their soul into the publishing of it: the way it\u2019s presented, the photographs. It really is a classic. 5. Shop Workshop Iss\u00e9, Paris This is the best sake shop in Paris. My friend Christian and I go here all the time to test new sake and eat food \u2013 in France we\u2019re obsessed with pairing the right drink with the right food. It\u2019s my headquarters: every week I go there and buy new products from Japan, and I do all my groceries there \u2013 you can find everything you need to cook Japanese food. I love the design, I love the music and I love their philosophy. This little shop is very important for me. I need that kind of place in Paris. It\u2019s like my drug. 6. Place Anavilhanas national park, Brazil My wife is from Brazil so we go there all the time, and it\u2019s really scary what\u2019s happening right now with the Amazon fires and all that destruction. I encourage anyone to go to this reserve: it\u2019s a natural archipelago three hours from Manaus, where you can discover the Amazon ecosystem by boat. You feel the wilderness of the environment and all the animals \u2013 it\u2019s very noisy at night \u2013 and you can feel you\u2019re part of something way, way bigger than you. You have to take a couple of planes to get to the lodge, but once you\u2019re there you will not regret it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
