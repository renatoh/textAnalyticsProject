Liverpool were beaten at Anfield in the league for the first time in 32 matches \u2013 a sequence stretching back to December 2007 \u2013 after Martin O'Neill's team, themselves under pressure following a poor start to the campaign, reacted in impressive style on Merseyside. An own-goal from Lucas, a header from Curtis Davies and a penalty conceded by Steven Gerrard condemned one of the favourites for the title to a second defeat in three matches. Ben\u00edtez's team have lost as many league games this season as they did in the whole of last term and the Spaniard admitted he is reliant on the likes of Gerrard, Javier Mascherano and last night's scorer Fernando Torres to correct their faltering form. \"It is up to the team to improve, not just some names, but it is also up to the senior players to take the responsibility and take us forward,\" said the Liverpool manager, who insisted his squad retains the quality to win the club's first league title since 1990. \"In the first 20 minutes we created plenty of chances and played well. Then we conceded the own-goal and started to make more mistakes. We were not playing well, and we were up against a team who are excellent on the counter-attack. Their keeper [Brad Friedel] made some great saves, but when that happens we just have to make more chances. This squad is virtually the same as last season, so I believe it is good enough to mount a title challenge. But we must do more, we must win at Bolton.\" The contest turned on the own-goal by Lucas but Ben\u00edtez refused to single out the midfielder for the defeat. \"I decided to take Lucas off because I wanted another striker on the pitch, not because he was playing worse than anyone else. I felt we had a chance when Torres scored but then Gerrard gave the penalty away \u2013 and it was a clear penalty \u2013 and there were many people involved in the second goal. If you want to analyse individual players you will have to analyse a lot of things.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
