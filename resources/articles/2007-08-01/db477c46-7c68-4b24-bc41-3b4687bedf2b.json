For a while, midway through the afternoon session when James Anderson and Ryan Sidebottom, helped by a little hazy cloud cover, bowled beautifully in tandem, they even placed pressure on Indian batsmen who had threatened to run riot, breaking down The Wall when Rahul Dravid seemed immovable and then depriving Dinesh Karthik of what had seemed an inevitable century. Towards the close of the day, with the second new ball available, there was a bonus wicket for Paul Collingwood, who removed Sourav Ganguly leg before wicket. That it came via a massive inside edge (an appalling decision from the umpire, Ian Howell) merely tickled the fancy of India's former captain. Does it constitute dissent for a batsman to grin as he walks from the field? By the close, though, it was India, needing only a draw to take the series victory, who had claimed the high ground in reaching 316 for four. Given the opportunity to bat first in pristine conditions, Wasim Jaffer and Karthik put on 62 for the first wicket before Anderson snared the former at third man for 35. Karthik and Dravid then added a further 127 before, in quick succession, Dravid was yorked middle stump by Anderson for 55 and Karthik was deemed to have edged Sidebottom when nine short of his hundred. Although the snickometer suggested no contact, Howell must have heard something. The batsman later backed his decision. With Ganguly gone for 37, VVS Laxman was left to negotiate his way beyond the second new ball and to the close in the company of Sachin Tendulkar, who in the final session had been constructing his innings with the serenity and patience of a stonemason working on a cathedral. With Laxman barely off the ground yet on 20, having completed 5,000 of the most elegant Test runs on the way, Tendulkar will resume this morning on 48. His has been a pragmatic innings, already beyond three hours in length, and, if he manages to go further than he did at Trent Bridge and complete a hundred or more in what, presumably, will be his last Test appearance in this country, then the finger will be pointed firmly at Matthew Prior. The wicketkeeper will have required a JCB to dig himself out of the avalanche of opprobrium heaped upon him in the past week, even before Tendulkar, then on 20, launched a drive at a ball slanted across him by Sidebottom and edged low to the wicketkeeper's right. Prior, leaden-footed, got to it but failed to hold the chance. Perhaps, said someone, he should have used his mouth. Sidebottom, who had worked so hard for his wicket, was beside himself. Tendulkar looks to have prepared particularly diligently for this match. In the second innings at Trent Bridge, as England pushed hard in a lost cause, he deflected to backward short-leg a ball directed into his ribs by Chris Tremlett. So, with The Oval habitually providing good bounce, he would have reasoned that more of the same might come his way. Crucially, though, the bounce here is consistent, easier for a batsman to judge and leave. Michael Vaughan duly posted his man round the corner, finer to allow for the extra pace in the pitch, with first Anderson and then Tremlett directing the ball at Tendulkar's ribcage. Was this what Tendulkar had been practising for? When England last went to Pakistan, the home coach, Bob Woolmer, prepared his team for the prospect of facing Steve Harmison by removing the mats from concrete indoor nets. In this country last year he transported around a marble slab for a similar purpose. Yesterday, while Tendulkar played himself in, anything banged in short he swayed away from or, on the line of his body, allowed to hit him with bat held aloft, well out of harm's way. Thus far Tendulkar has played an innings, for the most part, devoid of big shots (which may yet come today when the time is ripe), save one scamper down the pitch to greet a new spell from the spinner Monty Panesar by lofting him over mid-off. But there were still a couple of savage square cuts and one sumptuous cover drive, completed on bended knee, that was anything but subservient to the bowler. England have bowled well as a unit in this series and, if yesterday there was none of the violent swing that characterised the previous Tests at Lord's and Trent Bridge, then each of the seamers, including Tremlett, who brought good control, adapted well. Both Anderson's wickets were well thought out - the catch that dismissed Jaffer, taken by Kevin Pietersen at deepish third man from the sort of swashbuckling cut that earlier had produced the first six of the day, was conceived over team discussions. The bamboozling of Dravid with an outswinging yorker as he looked to clip through midwicket was a direct result of the wringer that Sidebottom had put the batsman through in the previous over. As ever, bowlers feed from one another."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
