Jealousy would be their prime motivator, their possessiveness over an unblemished home record ensuring their commitment to the cause in a match that was, from every other angle of their perspective, meaningless. A place in Europe was Dunfermline Athletic's objective, but visitors to Celtic Park these days tend to accept that the advancement of their prospects in whatever direction will probably have to wait for another day in another place. There was no denying the Fife team's collective diligence but, virtually throughout the match, the work was carried out in areas from which they would not be able to menace Robert Douglas, the home goalkeeper. Indeed, before Celtic scored their first, they had only once ventured close to the home goal, when Jason Dair's run down the left produced a low, threatening centre that was cleared by Tom Boyd. If this renewal of the fixture was an exact reprise of the men-against-boys superiority Celtic demonstrated in the 5-0 victory in February, it was the more meritorious considering the absence of Henrik Larsson. Without the great Swede, John Hartson assumed the role of chief predator, a part he played utterly convincingly when he delivered his twenty-second and twenty-third goals of the season. Once again, Steve Guppy was the supplier, the former Leicester City winger having done similar work for Hartson and Larsson a week earlier, when Celtic secured the championship with the 5-1 win over Livingston. On this occasion, Guppy gathered the ball on the left, side-stepped Lee Bullen and provided a cross with perfect pace and height towards the penalty spot. Hartson was always odds-on in the jump with Scott Thomson and his header hurtled to the left of Marco Ruitenbeek. If that was a monument to Hartson's power, Lambert's was a tribute to finesse. The Celtic captain's goals tend to be rarities in all senses of the word, not only infrequent, but stamped with high quality. This time, he received a short pass from Johan Mjallby after a scramble from a corner and, from 16 yards, drew the ball around a cluster of players and inside Ruitenbeek's right-hand post. Martin O'Neill took the opportunity to rest Neil Lennon and give more first-team experience to Jamie Smith at the start of the second half. The young forward expressed his gratitude with the third goal. Hartson tried a chip to Smith, but the ball bounced off one or two defenders before landing at the latter's feet and his well-struck volley from just inside the penalty area on the right was deflected home. Hartson completed his double at the end of some slick movement between Bobby Petta - he had replaced the injured Didier Agathe - Lambert and Stilian Petrov, the Bulgarian completing the chain by rolling the ball into the path of the Welshman on the right of the area. The low drive from the angle found the net at the far corner. On exhibition days such as these, anything is possible, as the 37-year-old Boyd showed by occasionally marauding down the right, recalling his days as a rampaging full-back. It was after coming inside and delivering an impeccable cross with his left foot that Momo Sylla sent a fierce, close-range header past Ruitenbeek for the fifth. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
