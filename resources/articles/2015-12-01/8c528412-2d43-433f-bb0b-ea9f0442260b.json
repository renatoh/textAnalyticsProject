We have plants flowering in the gardens that really shouldn\u2019t be at this time of year, such as Phacelia, and we even have a few roses still in bloom. We shouldn\u2019t see any seedlings growing outside, but currently we\u2019ve got wildflower seedlings growing among our tulip bulbs, which is virtually unheard of for December. Our Euphorbia seems to think it\u2019s March already, with yellow heads showing, and we keep cutting back plants only to find they just keep growing back. Another real consequence of the warmer weather is that the bugs and pests won\u2019t be killed off, which may mean we will have many more to deal with than usual in the spring time. The warm December has also meant lots of rain, so waterlogging may be a problem for some gardens out there. We combat this with lots of compost; my advice to other gardeners would be to do the same and ensure heavy objects are moved away from lawns so that soil isn\u2019t compacted. If the mild weather continues and we have early fruit tree blossoms followed by a hard frost, the fruit harvest could be seriously damaged. Martin Duncan Head gardener, Arundel Castle \u2022 At the carol service this week in the beautiful Beverley church of St Mary\u2019s, butterflies fluttered between the candles and lights. Some interpreted this in a spiritual way, but was it yet another sign of global warming? Mary Kelleher Hull \u2022 Our rhubarb is ready to be pulled \u2013 none of the seasonal cookery advice is proving helpful. Les Bright Exeter \u2022 Something is fighting back against Janet Gwilliam\u2019s midges (Letters, 19 December). That same day, mid-afternoon on our local nature reserve, a bat, probably a Daubenton\u2019s, was hunting the insects above the River Aire.
