Nationwide, which has almost 8 million current account holders, said that following a clampdown by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), it would be introducing a single overdraft interest rate of 39.9%, and removing many fees. That rate is more than double the 18.9% that the building society now charges holders of its FlexAccount for an authorised overdraft. The new rate, and the society\u2019s confirmation that two-thirds of its overdraft borrowers are set to pay more, follows warnings that while the shake-up would benefit more vulnerable consumers, it could lead to firms seeking to make up their losses by imposing higher authorised overdraft rates. Other banks are expected to announce higher headline rates over the coming months. Nationwide is the first major provider to respond to the FCA\u2019s clampdown announced in June, which the regulator said would \u201cmake overdrafts simpler, fairer, and easier to manage\u201d. The FCA announced it would be stopping banks from charging higher prices for unauthorised overdrafts than for authorised ones, banning fixed daily or monthly charges for borrowing in this way, and requiring banks to price overdrafts using a simple annual interest rate. The FCA said the current overdraft market was \u201cdysfunctional\u201d and \u201ccausing significant consumer harm\u201d. There are 26 million UK overdraft users, and they are a huge cash cow for banks, which made more than \u00a32.4bn from them in one year alone (2017). Authorised overdraft costs vary hugely and are often baffling \u2013 some banks impose daily fees, some charge monthly fees, some charge interest on the amount owed, and some use a combination of these. Unauthorised overdrafts can be punishingly expensive. While the new rules do not take effect until April 2020, Nationwide said its changes would begin in November 2019. It is bringing in a single overdraft rate of 39.9% across all its adult current accounts, which include FlexDirect, FlexPlus and FlexAccount. At the same time it will scrap all unauthorised borrowing charges, along with paid and unpaid transaction fees. A spokesperson said: \u201cA third of our overdraft borrowers will pay less or the same.\u201d Of those that will pay more, 75% will pay a maximum of 20p a day more than they currently pay. The society said: \u201cIf you are borrowing \u00a3500 for a day, it will cost 46p [in interest]\u201d. That is almost double the 24p in interest that someone with a FlexAccount borrowing \u00a3500 for one day on an arranged basis would pay now. However, based on this scenario, those holding Nationwide\u2019s FlexDirect or FlexPlus account are currently charged 50p a day. The society is also scrapping the \u00a3250 fee-free buffer offered on FlexPlus authorised overdrafts, and said there would be additional text alerts to help members manage their money. In June the FCA appeared to predict the steps taken by Nationwide, and those likely to be taken by other banks and building societies, when it said its shakeup \u201ccould create winners and losers, as firms would be likely to seek to recover lost overdraft revenue from within their overdraft offering by, for example, increasing arranged overdraft prices and reducing interest-free buffers\u201d. It added that it was particularly concerned about the welfare of vulnerable consumers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
