The manager takes his team to Liverpool for Saturday\u2019s late kick-off chasing the victory that would increase the pressure on Leicester, the Premier League leaders, before they face Southampton at home on Sunday. It will be the last time during the title run-in that Tottenham, who enter the weekend five points adrift of Leicester in second place, play their game before that of their rivals but Pochettino dismissed the significance of the scheduling. He merely wants Tottenham to do their job and ensure they would be in position to take advantage if Leicester were to wobble. \u201cI think it\u2019s normal, in our head, to wait that they drop points because we are competitive, ambitious and we want to win the title,\u201d the manager said. \u201cBut we should not be focused on that. We need to be focused on ourselves because if they drop points and we don\u2019t get the points, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d After this weekend, Leicester will play before Tottenham in the next four rounds of matches \u2013 largely because Tottenham have been given three Monday night games \u2013 before the final two fixtures are synchronised. \u201cI don\u2019t say if it\u2019s fair or unfair,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cI think the battle is about ourselves. We have a very tough game against Liverpool and it\u2019s important to win. If not, we don\u2019t wait for anything in the Leicester game. Our game is more important.\u201d Pochettino will be hoping his former club Southampton can do Tottenham a favour at Leicester. \u201cBut it\u2019s like our opponents,\u201d he added. \u201cLeicester on Saturday \u2013 [Claudio] Ranieri and all of his players will be in front of the TV in Liverpool shirts. It\u2019s normal. It\u2019s good.\u201d Tottenham have a poor record at Anfield, with one league win from their previous 21 attempts, but they have made some big statements this season, such as the 2-1 win at Manchester City in February, and Pochettino is optimistic. \u201cThe City win was good for us because belief is the most important thing and it was a very good victory,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cWe are now in a moment where we can believe we can win at Anfield. Then again, it\u2019s football and we need to create the good things to win the game. We just need to do our job.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
