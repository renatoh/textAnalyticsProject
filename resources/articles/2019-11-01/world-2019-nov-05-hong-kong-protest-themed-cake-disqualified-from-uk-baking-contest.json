The three-tiered cake features a mini black-clad protester in a yellow hard hat, a large Guy Fawkes mask, tiny umbrellas and mini political slogans \u2013 all symbols of the ongoing protests. It even has a miniature black LP record playing the unofficial anthem of the protest, Glory to Hong Kong, and emits a vapour designed to look like tear gas. Its creator, 3rd Space cafe, believes the cake was the victim of political censorship. The cafe, in Hong Kong\u2019s Sheung Wan district, said it received an email from Cake International saying \u201cthe content and message behind the cake has been viewed as offensive and led to complaints from attendees\u201d. The organisers of the competition in Birmingham said in a Facebook post dated Sunday that the removal of the piece from the competition area \u201cwas due to complaints about its content with some threatening to damage the piece\u201d but said it had judged the entry based on cake decorating skills only. It said the cake was \u201cnot to schedule\u201d because the rules said \u201cno part of the exhibit can overhang the allowed area\u201d and \u201coversized exhibits will be disqualified\u201d. In a statement responding to the Guardian\u2019s enquiry, the 3rd Space cafe said the organisers\u2019 reply has confirmed that \u201cthey did apply political censorship \u2026 in response to the complaints from Chinese contestants who also threatened to damage our cake.\u201d \u201cWe are disappointed by the UK organisers giving in to the threat and removing our cakes from display,\u201d it said. The decision drew outrage on social media, with more than 3,000 comments made in response to Cake International\u2019s statement on Facebook. \u201cSomeone threatened to damage the cake and your decision is to disqualify the cake instead of protecting it?\u201d said a post. \u201cShame on you!\u201d said another post. The person who purportedly complained about the cake on social media platform Weibo proclaimed the victory of \u201cthe joint efforts of Chinese competitors\u201d. \u201cI\u2019d like to say, there is no absolute freedom of speech, freedoms need to be built upon law and national interests,\u201d said the post."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
