And the United States is going to get very angry, too.\u201d Trump's comments came after Russian and Syrian warplanes resumed airstrikes against insurgents in the densely populated enclave. The bombardment began just hours after Trump warned on Twitter that Assad \u201cmust not recklessly attack Idlib Province\u201d. Representatives of Russia, Turkey and Iran are to meet in Tehran on Friday for a summit which has been described by Ankara as a \u201clast chance to avoid a massacre\u201d. More than 3 million people live in the province, nearly a third of whom were internally displaced there during the country\u2019s seven-year war. The White House on Tuesday threatened military intervention if the Syrian government used chemical weapons. \u201cLet us be clear, it remains our firm stance that if President Bashar al-Assad chooses to again use chemical weapons, the United States and its Allies will respond swiftly and appropriately,\u201d the White House said in a statement on Tuesday. Trump on Wednesday also denied that he wanted to assassinate Assad \u2013 one of the many shocking claims made in a new book by the acclaimed Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward. \u201cThat was never even contemplated,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNor would it be contemplated.\u201d After the Syrian government launched a chemical attack on civilians in April 2017, Trump reportedly called his defense secretary, Jim Mattis, and said he wanted to kill Assad, according to Woodward\u2019s Fear: Trump in the White House. \u201cLet\u2019s fucking kill him! Let\u2019s go in. Let\u2019s kill the fucking lot of them,\u201d Trump reportedly said. Mattis, according to the book, assured the president he would look into it but told a senior aide: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do any of that. We\u2019re going to be much more measured.\u201d The national security team ultimately presented Trump with options for airstrikes, which he ordered. Mattis has called the book a work of \u201cfiction\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
