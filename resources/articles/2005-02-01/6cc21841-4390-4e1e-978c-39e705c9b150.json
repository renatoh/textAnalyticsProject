But in our house, choosing where we go often is the catalyst for a series of arguments that only end as we clamber on board the plane. Although I'm very fond of guidebooks, I'm utterly daunted by holiday brochures. In their glossy and over-egged pages, everywhere seems to meld into one blue-skyed, sunlounger-stuffed, oblong-pool-centred, indistinguishable destination. So a family-friendly tag can make all the difference. No one wants to go where they're unwelcome. But still, the choice can be overwhelming. Eager to attract families, a wide range of destinations are boasting that they are particularly suitable for any age. Yet families still largely opt for the tried and trusted. The Balearics and the Greek Islands are particularly popular. Menorca has twice been awarded most family-friendly European destination; Zakynthos, often expunged from the brochures of more upmarket companies, also likes to promote itself as a kids' haven. Both promised multi-generational bliss for a fortnight. But which would win the title of best family-friendly isle? We - a mum, dad, 11-year-old, three-year-old twins, and granny - decided to put them to the test. Menorca Getting there: Brilliantly short flight time of just 2 hours, from 16 different airports, and only one hour ahead of GMT. Climate: Sunshine, but not too hot. Even rained a little while we were there. Accommodation: Private villa with pool on an estate of identical villas. Beach: Menorca's beaches aren't great for kids, as the clean and beautiful ones are only accessible down steep cliffs, and often after a bit of a walk. Pool essential if you want to go swimming. Food: Although not strictly Menorcan, paella was a big hit, as everyone could pick out the bits they liked. Best family attraction: Nightly horse shows under the stars (menorca.net/sm). Best family souvenir: Albarques - leather sandals with car tyre soles - which come in all sizes and funky colours. And, of course, the T-shirts. Family-friendliness: After waiting for half an hour in the sun for the local bus into Cuitadella, the nearby old capital, the driver refused to take the double buggy. Realised soon afterwards that, with five of us, it was cheaper to take a taxi anyway. Mum's verdict: Felt as if I was in a suburb in the sun. A little too planned, tidy and, as a result, boring. Could have done with more challenges, even if they do make family life a little awkward. Dad's verdict: Enjoyed hiring bikes with child seats for the kids (which was very cheap), and cycling into Ciutadella, winding along the flat coastal road at the top of the cliffs. Granny's verdict: Take a book of crosswords, as there's nothing else to do for a grandparent apart from watch the kids play in the pool. 11-year-old Storme's verdict: Best ice cream ever at Gelacia de Ciutadella with wicked flavours - liquorice, marshmallow and fig. 3-year-old twins' verdict: Loved being able to swim any time of day or night, right outside their back door. Cost: One week in Villas Maribel, Cala Santandria, \u00a3314-\u00a3484 per adult, \u00a399-\u00a3259 per child, depending on time of year, with Direct Holidays (brochure line 0870 2422404, directholidays.co.uk). Zakynthos Getting there: Flight time 3hrs; two hours ahead of GMT. Climate: Very hot in the summer, and we experienced a spectacular storm. Accommodation: Our villa was simple but perfect. There was a pool at the cafe next door, free to use as long as you bought a few drinks. Beach: Very quiet, shelved, shingle beach (so much better than sand for small children), with easy access just a few minutes' walk away, perfect for swimming. A single taverna overlooking the water, for cold drinks and lunch. Food: Grilled meat at the taverna on the beach was everyone's favourite. (Pack a torch in case you want to go there after dark.) Nearby supermarket had everything you needed to cook yourself, and the local bakery provided fresh bread and cheese pies for breakfast. Best family attraction: Going out on a boat trip with Marios, who takes you through the caves then on to Agios Sostis for lunch. Just ask for him by name at the local bar, and they'll put you in touch. Best family souvenir: Jars of local honey from the farmers in Zakynthos town market, to put over the Weetabix when we got home. Family-friendliness: If it's highchairs in the tavernas and pushchair-accessible facilities you're looking for, then Zakynthos fails the test. But in terms of attitudes, nowhere could be more laid-back when your toddler has a tantrum in public. Sadly, we can vouch for that. Mum's verdict: Great - we didn't need a car to get anywhere, as everything was within a few minutes' stroll. The advantage of a communal pool is that your kids meet other kids, which divides childcare. We took our own paddling pool for short cooling dips under the shade of an olive tree in the garden. Dad's verdict: Liked buying fish from the boats in Zakynthos, to cook on the barbeque. Granny's verdict: Found the cafes a bit challenging, as they seemed to sell only three things, none of which I drink - beer, Fanta, and coffee. 11-year-old Storme's verdict: Liked gathering stones on the beach and painting them back on our balcony. And paddling out to the small boats that draw up to the beach, selling Fanta and bananas (and beer for parents). 3-year-old twins' verdict: Liked home-made nougat shops in Zante town. But didn't like the mosquitos. Cost: One week at the White House, Vasilikos, \u00a3279-\u00a3475 per adult, \u00a389-\u00a3259 per child, depending on time of year, with Direct Greece (brochure line 0870 1919091, directgreece.co.uk). And the winner is ... Taking votes from each family member, Zakynthos won by a large majority. (Only three-year-old River preferred Menorca, and that was because I'd bought him a bright blue Menorca lilo for the swimming pool.) It just has everything necessary, and no fussy extras - good simple food, lovely easily accessible beach, and a large swimming pool (even if it wasn't ours alone). If you could buy a kit for a perfect family holiday that doesn't demand too much, this island would probably have all the pieces. What our readers say Mark Klein from Manchester and his family (four and one year old) have been to Menorca twice, staying in a private apartment in the small resort of Arenal D'en Castell. His verdict: 'Sandy beach with gentle slope perfect for small children, but not good if you want activities - only pedalos for hire. Restaurants all of the pizza-pasta-cafe variety; again, great for the kids, but not for authentic Spanish cuisine. We took the kids to the children's disco in the local hotel complex; downside is that sitting on the terrace at night, the tranquility of the bay is tinged by the distant strains of Rivers Of Babylon. Overall, plenty to do if staying for a short time, but mostly lying on the beach or by the pool.' Rachel Cornes from Sheffield has a five-, three- and one-year-old. She went to Zakynthos. Her verdict: 'It was late May, but we still found the afternoons too hot so it was difficult to entertain the kids. The island was full of British holidaymakers, so sometimes it felt like a bit of Britain in the Med. But it was great for the money, and we had a lovely time.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
