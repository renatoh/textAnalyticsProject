He has only recently taken up residence, so he doesn't know much about the country. Can you please suggest where I should go and what I should see? Elizabeth McTiernan, by email Ghana is a friendly country which is easy to get around. It has a lot to interest the traveller, from natural attractions and historical sites to beaches well worth your time. Spend a few days in the capital, Accra, then head to the Cape Coast to explore the coastal forts that can be found from Accra to Takoradi and beyond. There are plenty of friendly villages and acclaimed beaches to visit along the way. Take time to see Kakum National Park, which has Africa's only forest canopy walkway, stretching above the habitats of elephants, antelope and monkeys. Kumasi, once the capital of the Ashanti kingdom, is a vibrant, fascinating city. At least two days is essential to get a feel for the place and see its museums and markets. Lake Volta, Africa's largest artificial lake, is worth exploring by boat. Visit www.africaonline.com.gh for more information on this fascinating country. Talking Turkish lira My wife and I will visit Oludeniz in Turkey for the first time in May, for two weeks. I have had conflicting advice about whether to take cash in sterling or US dollars, use travellers' cheques for sterling or euros or just get money from machines at banks, as needed. I am a little confused. What's the best thing to do? Mike Smith, Plymouth Exchange facilities in Turkey can vary from place to place. It's best to wait until you arrive to get any Turkish lira and to change money every few days if the rate is moving in your favour. The currency website www.oanda.com is useful for up-to-date rates. Travellers' cheques are the least straightforward form of currency. You often get a poor rate and may have problems cashing even the best-known types and may even have to pay to change them. If you must take these, US dollar cheques will be the most commonly accepted. The easiest way to carry cash is to use ATMs to get lira. First, register your account for online banking. Keep some cash in reserve and check in every few days to keep track of your funds. Again, US dollars are best, but euros or pounds should be easy enough to exchange, especially in major tourist areas. Credit cards are accepted in a huge variety of establishments. More tips and information can be found in Lonely Planet's new Turkey guide and www.infoexchange.com/Turkey. Partying, Italian-style I want to celebrate my thirtieth birthday next August in my native Italy with friends and family. I wanted to hire a villa as cheaply as possible for a weekend or stay at an agriturismo resort, but many places are not available for such a short time in the high season. Can you please suggest a way to make my birthday bash come true? There's going to be eight of us and the final destination should be within half a day's drive of Lecco, on Lake Como, where my parents and friends are based. Tuscany and Liguria would be my favourite locations. Stefania, by email An alternative to a villa would be a small country house hotel where you and your friends would take over nearly the whole place. Italian Journeys (020 7370 6002) can book several such places in Tuscany. Unfortunately, they are fairly expensive, at \u00a364 per person per night, including breakfast, but at least you won't be paying for days when you're back in Britain. If your budget won't stretch this far, there are villas for around \u00a326 per person per night, even when you take them for a whole week in the high season. Look for those that sleep six to eight, rather than eight to 10. This often means that two of the sleeping places are sofa beds in the living room or camp beds in a bedroom. Just make sure none is a cot! Invitation to Tuscany (020 7603 7111) and La Dolce Vita (020 8690 9701) are sites with plenty of options. Cambodia frontier fear I recently spent a month in Thailand and, having had the time of my life, vowed to go back this autumn. I didn't have the funds or the information to travel as extensively as I might have liked last time, but when I go back I want to move around a lot more, in Thailand and neighbouring Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. Soon after my return I heard of riots and the expulsion of Thais from Cambodia and the destruction of their businesses in the capital, Phnom Penh, owing to remarks attributed to a Thai actress about the Temple of Angkor Wat. I hold no great fears for my own safety, but I plan to travel with a girlfriend from Bangkok, who is ethnic Chinese but has a Thai passport. I am worried it may be too dangerous for her to accompany me to Cambodia and that she may be refused entry. Joseph Sexton, Ballincollig, Republic of Ireland At the time of writing the Thai government had closed the border to its own citizens in response to the violence. Foreigners, however, are free to cross. Britons require visas, which can be obtained on arrival in Cambodia from Thailand - at Poipet frontier crossing, which is open 7.30am-5pm, and Koh Kong (7am-5pm). Hopefully, Thai citizens will soon be free to cross again. Until they are, your girlfriend will be unable to go with you. Check the Foreign Office website for the latest situation or look at the thorn tree section on the Lonely Planet website. The Cambodia and Thailand discussion boards have postings from people who have crossed recently. Over to you... readers' feedback A response to Alison Courtney's request for a special beach to visit near Cape Town (Letters, last week): Noordhoek beach is splendid for surfing and riding. The Dunes racing stable there will take experienced riders for gallops on former racehorses, while Sleepy Hollow stable caters for all abilities. The beach is not, however, ideal for swimming. The Atlantic water is icy and it is often windy. Even Fishoek and Boulders beaches, on the Indian Ocean side of the peninsula, have cold water. We wished we had taken wetsuits.
