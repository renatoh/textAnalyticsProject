They cost \u00a315 from the consulate in Holborn or from your travel operator. This is stamped and kept in your passport until you leave. No permanent stamp is made in your passport. We have just returned and it is remarkably hassle-free to get in and out. Have a nice holiday. Clive Aldenhoven \u0095 My partner and I visited Cuba eight years ago and had a fantastic time. On arrival, a loose card/entry visa was placed inside each passport with an entry stamp and details on it. On our departure from Cuba, the cards were stamped with the exit date and removed. Neither passport was stamped and therefore there was no physical evidence of the visit. Sharon Cooper \u0095 My passport wasn't stamped (1999) but Richard Davies should also be aware that he and his family need six months between the end of their visit to Cuba to the date at which their passports expire. Jenny Moore \u0095 I travelled to Cuba in December 2000 and officials did not stamp passports of European visitors. The essential requirement for each visitor is a tourist visa which is stamped on entry and exit from Cuba. They are obtainable from the Cuban embassy or can be more easily purchased through a tour operator - I found Journey Latin America to be very useful and helpful in this regard. You should allow at least one month to obtain the visa. However, do remember that, due to the embargo, credit cards issued from US companies are not accepted in Cuba, although everything you pay for will be charged in US dollars. Julian Clifton \u0095 The Cubans are aware of past problems encountered when entering the USA with a Cuban stamp in your passport, and to this end won't (or shouldn't) stamp it - that is if you're travelling to Cuba as a tourist. Instead, a 'tourist card' will be issued by your travel agent/tour operator before you leave, costing \u00a315, which is valid for one month. The only problem with a tourist card is that it's a small piece of paper, and therefore quite easy to lose. A stamp can sometimes be put in your passport when changing money, but these are generally illegible. To be fair, the US are far more liberal now, at least in terms of foreigners arriving with Cuban stamps in their passports. The worse that will happen is that you'll be delayed for half an hour or so for routine questioning. Sco \u0095 I visited Havana in 1993, and New York in 1994 without any trouble, collecting entry stamps in my passport on both occasions. When I flew into the US in 1996, the immigration official actually stamped my passport on the same page as my Cuba stamp. Wear your Cuba stamps with pride! Rick Hall \u0095 Since 1995 I have holidayed in Cuba six times. More often than not, the officials there did not bother to stamp passports, though mine was stamped a couple of times; in fact, some of my fellow travellers had to request a stamp so as to show off that they had been to Cuba. In 1999 I paid a visit to the US and the immigration officials showed no special interest in me. Asher Cashdan \u0095 I visited Cuba and had my passport stamped on the way in and on the way out and have since been to San Francisco and New York with no problems whatsoever. Enjoy Cuba - it is a wonderful country with friendly, kind people and great rum! Daniel Jones \u0095 We went to Cuba in 1995 and our passports were stamped, and have been to America in 1998 and 1999 with no problems at American immigration control. Can I also recommend two trips: the first is a trip from Varadero to Trinidad (The Cuban one) in a Russian bi-plane. You get to fly the plane on the way and the return views are spectacular. The second is to the Bay of Pigs, the American landing site - history in the raw. Bob Ellis \u0095 On both of my visits to Cuba I have asked, in both awful Spanish and hand signals, for a visa stamp in my passport and not on the small piece of paper they issue and keep on exit. Explaining with limited Spanish that you hope the Cuban visa will keep me out of a country that practices economic terrorism, should I ever find myself accidentally booking a flight to Disneyland, can be a bit awkward. On all entries/exits I have found that the stern customs official is only too happy to help and will add a visa (in red ink) with a smile!
