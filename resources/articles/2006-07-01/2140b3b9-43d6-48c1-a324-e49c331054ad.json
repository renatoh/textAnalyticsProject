That is, other than the 800 or 900 perfectly suitable outfits in my wardrobe. I had been walking past a white dress for some days, in a shop with which I have a 23-year-old broiges - ie, I don't speak to them and they don't speak to me. Neither of us can remember why. This dress, however, had my name on it and clearly I would have to swallow my pride and put my money where my mouth wasn't. So, I hovered, dashed in, had a chat, bought it. White may be the new black, but it's not hip to have 40-inch hips and I didn't want to appear from the cubicle as an inverted Cornetto, so I waited until I got home to try it on. Georg the Dog Sitter arrived at 6.45pm. I know, I should be leaving Diva alone, but I wanted to wait until her season was over and wean her into being on her own gradually. The day before I'd explained to her that I'd be gone for one hour only, settled her in her basket with a tasty bone, said goodbye and sauntered elaborately out of the door, only listening, hunched over the letterbox, for five or six minutes. When the kids were small, Amy perfected the knack of hurling herself at the windows as I left for rehearsals, with her mouth in an Edvard Munch rictus. It gave me heartburn for the whole day. Au pairs told me she cut it out and went back to terrorising her brother the minute I turned the corner, but, as of old, I was thankful not to hear that pitiful and piercing Basenji yodel following me down to the Patisserie caf\u00e9 where I intended to sit out the hour. When I returned - for that, read: when I abandoned a perfectly good piece of rye toast and ran all the way home - Diva was ecstatic, leaping and fawning. She'd been awfully good, I assured her as I patted and stroked her, she'd even peed on the newspaper provided. \"Who's my best girl? Who's a big, brave grown-up girl?,\" I cooed, and got the dustpan and broom. It was, after all, my fault entirely that I'd left a carrier bag on the hall chair with a red feather boa inside it. Well, a late red feather boa. I surveyed the poultry slaughterhouse before me more in sorrow than in anger. It was a start. So, back to the evening of the party. Leaving her downstairs with Uncle Georg and a liver snack, I went up to slap on some concealer, confident that the dress would do the rest. It was a humid day to be wearing an all in one foundation garment but Dolce &amp; Gabbana stretch cotton takes no prisoners and a visible pantie line and dolcelatte thighs were out of the question. So, trussed and bound, I attempted to slide seamlessly into the dress. The dress had other ideas. For the next 10 minutes woman and dress were locked in battle like muntjak and musk ox. I got it over my head but as I rolled down the dress the foundation garment rose to meet it. I started again, got the dress down to my middle and found my head was in the armhole. I took it off again, replaced my head in the correct hole, then tried dragging it down with a twisting action, hips going one way and chest the other. My face was a glazed crimson and my hair a damp trellis. This was no way to start an evening of tinkling crystal, witty badinage and subtle networking. Still, I would not be beaten by something that once grew on a bush. I persevered and battered the damn thing into submission, smoothed it, arranged it around the protuberances it was meant to enhance - and immediately needed the loo. I'm sensitive to the fact that you may be having your breakfast, so I'll skip the bit where dress and foundation garment are bunched into a sort of spandex boa constrictor, and cut to the arrival at a garden square in town. I parked conveniently near Montague Place, the party being off Montague Street, and wobbled over the grass on soil-piercing heels towards the smallish throng of people. I was surprised on two counts: that no one came to greet me and offer a drop of wine, and that the guests were quite grungily dressed. It took me a while to realise that flashing my dazzling new dress at a group of students having a quiet drink in the grounds of University College was perhaps not the same as flaunting it over olive tapenade and mojitos at the Guardian summer party. By the time I found the right party, in the right garden square, my heels were deep in mud, my dress was actually hurting me and I'd lost the will to network. When I got home, the dog had eaten a Biro and my column. She'd had a Guardian party of her own. \u00b7 So confident of predicting the winner of the World Cup was I last week that I ventured into the testosterone and hop-charged world of the betting shop and put a tenner on Italy to win. The next day I went in to retrieve my winnings. My slip said, \"Italy to win - extra-time penalty shoot-out 2-1\". The dour woman behind the grid informed me that I was not entitled to my winnings because my slip should have read, \"Italy to win after extra time\" and because strictly speaking you don't count a penalty as a goal. I contemplated headbutting her but the grid was in the way. A fair amount of sledging went on, though, of the \"So if you knew that, why did you accept my bet?\" variety, stopping just short of \"I spit on your mother's ancestors,\" and I emerged victorious, clutching my spoils. Many words have been churned out on the Zidane incident, but if I may add mine: clearly, apologising in one breath and saying you don't regret anything in another is carrying French diplomacy a bit beyond the edges of satire. Still, can we take it holistically as the one slur on a lifetime of superb giving? I think Jacques Chirac is insane to condone the crime but correct to embrace the man. Zizou's punishment is to live with himself for the next few years. \u00b7 Today I visited the British Library for lunch with my daughter. The last time I was in the building was a viewing before it officially opened. Everyone was aware of the controversy surrounding the building, and the vicious criticisms levelled at the architects, Colin St John Wilson and MJ Long. It was late in completion and had teething problems, all caused by subsequent governments moving the goalposts, using funding delays to make political points. That night, though, we were all bowled over. The red-brick exterior was cool and restrained, but, like your favourite book, the inside held treasures, remembered and forgotten, and new thoughts and angles took you completely by surprise. Today I liked it even more, because I could see it worked. In the sunshine, the cafes, terraces and restaurants were full and quietly bustling, the old library encased in dark glass, like a secret meant to inspire, the central atrium cool and spacious and the reading room packed, peaceful but not po-faced or pompous. I'd like to think the chattering critics have sent lots of champagne to Sandy Wilson but somehow I doubt they did. \u00b7 This week Maureen saw The Baby Mind Reader on Five: \"Truly has to be seen. Don't take my word for it - watch it.\" Maureen watched Soundproof: \"An actual play on actual BBC2 - thrilling! An excellent performance from Susan Lynch.\" Maureen read Private Peaceful by Michael Morpurgo: \"A first-world-war novella written with stark simplicity and all the more eloquent for it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
