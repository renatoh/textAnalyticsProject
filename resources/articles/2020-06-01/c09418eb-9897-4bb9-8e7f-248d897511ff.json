Victory for the Irishman would break the trainer\u2019s record of seven wins in the Epsom race, which has stood since Robert Robson was the first to reach that total in 1823, but O\u2019Brien lacks an obvious star and the first three in the betting are trained in England. The difficulty this year is that the three major European Derbys will take place over a period of just eight days, starting with the Irish version on Saturday evening. Speaking in a webinar organised by Curragh officials on Wednesday evening, O\u2019Brien said it was unlikely that he would ask any horse to run in the Derby just a week after competing in Ireland. Asked about his Epsom plans, O\u2019Brien began by saying: \u201cWe\u2019re thinking of running back some of the Irish Guineas horses in Epsom.\u201d That race was just a fortnight ago and the trainer decided this weekend\u2019s Irish Derby would come too soon for the likes of Vatican City, second in the Guineas. Though he did not mention them by name, he may also be considering Epsom for Armory, fourth in the Guineas, and the pacemaker Fort Myers. Of Russian Emperor, a winner at Royal Ascot, O\u2019Brien said: \u201cHe looks to have come out of it well. He hasn\u2019t done a lot, one little bit, he seems to be in good form. Entries for Epsom are on Monday. We have him down to be entered at the moment. So far, he seems to be in good form.\u201d O\u2019Brien made no mention of the French Derby a week on Sunday, for which Vatican City is currently second in the betting and Russian Emperor third. He appeared more concerned about the rushed preparation given to Mogul, a beaten favourite at Ascot. \u201cHe needed two runs, really, before the Derby but we weren\u2019t able to get two runs into him. So we ran him in the toughest race over a mile and a half and we\u2019re kind of asking that race to do two races\u2019 job. \u201cWe had worked him as hard as we could but some horses need racing to get them there. He was very vulnerable going to Ascot but we thought, going to Epsom, he probably had to have a tough mile and a half somewhere. We just felt that was as tough as we could give him and at the same time give him a chance to make it back.\u201d O\u2019Brien named six horses as potential runners in the Irish Derby: Arthur\u2019s Kingdom, Dawn Patrol, Tiger Moth, Santiago, Mythical and Serpentine. Adding spice to the rest of this weekend\u2019s action at the Curragh, his intended runners include Magical, having her first race since winning the Champion Stakes at Ascot in October, and Sovereign, not seen since his shock 33-1 success in last year\u2019s Irish Derby. He confirmed that Love, the impressive 1,000 Guineas winner, was on course for next week\u2019s Oaks, so long as the ground does not go soft. Peaceful, his Irish 1,000 Guineas winner, is more likely to wait for the Irish Oaks later in July. Meanwhile, English King, the Derby favourite, has had a getting-to-know-you gallop with Frankie Dettori, recently booked to ride him at Epsom. The colt\u2019s trainer, Ed Walker, said: \u201cFrankie just wanted to come down, get a feel for the horse and he really liked him. He really wanted to get inside the horse\u2019s head and understand him, which is a mark of Frankie\u2019s professionalism. He rode him for well over an hour, they got on great. \u201cHe loves his personality, because he\u2019s got a really big personality. He\u2019s a playful horse, he\u2019s not a boring horse, who just plods around the gallops. He\u2019s a fun horse.\u201d Thursday\u2019s best bets The money has been coming this morning for Exotic Escape (2.45) at Haydock, after the same connections had a well backed winner there on Wednesday. This three-year-old showed promise on her first start since leaving David Lanigan for David Loughnane, staying on bravely into fourth at Chelmsford after racing wide and far too free in the early stages. Today\u2019s extra furlong helps and Hollie Doyle is booked. As at 9.30am, the best available is 11-2, as the influential Hugh Taylor tipped her up half an hour earlier. At Leicester tonight, Buzz Killington (6.55) could be overpriced at 14-1 on his first start since joining Grant Tuer from Noel Meade. Just two starts ago, he beat 13 rivals at Dundalk, although the blinkers fitted that day have been left off here. A mile and a half was too far on his only start since and he has since had a wind operation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
