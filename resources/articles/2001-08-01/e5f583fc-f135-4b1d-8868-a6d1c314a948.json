Exporters have been complaining for more than four years about the impact of overvalued sterling. But they have increasingly admitted that global, and particularly European demand, is the real cause for concern. So, as Europe's motor, Germany, founders, the least UK manufacturers could have hoped for was a euro rate cut. 'It is not in our remit to criticise the ECB, but it would be helpful if they were cutting rates too. It would help to revive the euro economies, but also it would help the euro strengthen because it would be seen as the right thing to do,' says Stephen Radley of the Engineering Employers Federation. There are two main problems. First, the MPC decision was interpreted as a move to help manufacturing. But the exchange rate seems remarkably resilient. The second is that, by not following suit, the ECB suggests not only that it is unwilling to risk inflation in Europe by stoking weak continental demand but that the MPC may be acting precipitously in the UK. This second point runs counter to much of the criticism of the credibility of the ECB - plagued by accusations that its policy-making structures are opaque. Nevertheless, the ECB has cut rates only once this year, in May, to 4.5 per cent. Martin Weale, of the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, says: 'I suspect it suggests that either they have difficulty in coming to a decision - or that they have a stronger commitment to price stability than the UK.'He adds: 'I agree that the Eurozone should have cut interest rates in the same way as the MPC.' Richard Jeffrey of ING Barings says: 'It may suggest that the MPC is more flexible. But its job is easier. The ECB has to deal with Irish and Greek problems as well as Germany, France and Italy.' This is one reason eurosceptic economists are against joining the euro. However, the most significant recent drop in sterling came in the wake of the election, which the markets saw as making euro membership more likely."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
