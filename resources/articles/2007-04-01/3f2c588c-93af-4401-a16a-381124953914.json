I was a young pro myself at Lancashire when the decision was made that he wasn't going to make it with us, and then got to know him as an opponent when he was wicket-keeping for Worcestershire and briefly Sussex before my career ended in 1988. It's only in the last few years since he was pinpointed as one of the up-and-coming coaches that I've really worked with him closely but the qualities that will make him such a good appointment were apparent from the start. Ask anyone about Mooresy and they'll tell you about his enthusiasm. He's got a great passion for the game, and specifically for English cricket to do well. We both played in an era in county cricket when you'd speak with opposing players about the game, and that is one of the things we've both been keen to reintroduce into the younger players we now work with at the England National Cricket Academy in Loughborough, trying to develop them as people as well as cricketers. He's a very fit bloke, who made the most of his abilities as a player but obviously there has to be much more to him to make him the right man for England. He went through the ECB level four course for coaches when it was introduced about six years ago, and as well as enthusiasm it was the innovation he showed that really impressed people. I think that's been a key part of the great success he has enjoyed at Sussex, establishing a county without a Test ground or any real stars as the most successful in the country. He's also been very astute in the people he's signed, most obviously Mushtaq Ahmed but also guys like Murray Goodwin. That speaks volumes for his ability to identify talent and for his man-management. It's been the same with younger players like Luke Wright, who he took down to Sussex from Leicestershire and has been at the academy. In his interview before he came to us he mentioned the plan that had been set out with Mooresy for the next three years for Luke to become a successful county and Test cricketer. Pete's very thorough in his attention to detail but also willing to break off at a tangent in training in response to good ideas from anyone; fellow coaches, players and coaches from other sports. The knowledge he's got of the county set-up should also be a big strength. Having worked with a county in the recent past, he had a perception of the counties' relationship with the ECB, and since he joined us at the academy he's been very keen to get the message across to the counties of what we're trying to achieve so they will buy into it. He may not have played at the highest level but he's got a great knowledge of what's required from the way he immerses himself in the game. And there won't be any problem in working with the senior England players because he knows them all well through the way they have been encouraged to use the academy's facilities at Loughborough much more in recent years. Guys like Andrew Flintoff have been down a lot as part of their rehab, and he worked closely with Michael Vaughan in Perth this winter when he was on his way back. Of course he's worked even more with the younger players who have come into the side this winter in his last couple of years at the academy. I think he is the right man taking over at the right time. His enthusiasm is infectious - even when you're cheesed off after a drive down from Lancashire to Loughborough, it doesn't last long when you're working with Mooresy.
