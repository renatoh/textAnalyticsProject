But this issue is far too important to be used to settle old scores. It is a moment for all sections of the UK media to smell the coffee. Like the political class shaken to the core by the MPs' expenses scandal, they must choose between denial and change. It is time for a wider debate about media conduct and ethics. While we support self-regulation, it is a privilege that must be underpinned by responsibility and accountability. The right to redress through complaint is important, but so are media that constantly reflect on ethical and legal boundaries. Phone-hacking is illegal but it is a symptom of a \"story at all costs\" culture that too often leads good people to do bad things. The interaction between journalists and politicians is the prism through which citizens make judgments about politicians, political parties and the society in which they live. There are many column inches of comment dedicated to the decisions and actions of politicians. Relatively few raise questions about the role and power of the media. It is time for some serious self-reflection. News International must demonstrate that it is now taking responsibility for its actions, not as a tactical retreat but an authentic exercise in contrition. But so should any other media organisation with reason to believe that its actions now or in the past have been unethical or unlawful. The stark lesson of the MPs' expenses scandal is that no one in Britain is above the law. Anyone, irrespective of status, who has broken the law must be brought to justice. For many, either on the political left or among business competitors, the Murdochs generate strong feelings. But both progressives and competitors should acknowledge that millions of citizens choose their TV and newspaper products because they want what is on offer. To label our fellow citizens as ignorant or reactionary is patronising and avoids some uncomfortable truths about their connection with readers and viewers. Did Murdoch's papers desert Labour to help the Tories win the election? Or because they knew many \u2013 too many \u2013 voters had deserted Labour? Murdoch has every right to pursue his business interests and hold strong political views, although there can be no place for a Fox News equivalent in the UK. But no commercial organisation has the right to write the law or break the law. That is why Labour has been consistent in calling for News Corp's bid for BSkyB to be dealt with transparently through the regulatory process. We urged Vince Cable to refer the deal to Ofcom, called for his dismissal when he boasted of declaring war on Murdoch, questioned Jeremy Hunt's impartiality, and challenged his decision not to follow Ofcom's advice immediately on referral to the Competition Commission. We have outstanding questions about David Cameron's dinner with James Murdoch in the middle of a quasi judicial process. Media plurality is central to our democracy: this deal and any similar deal should be subject to thorough scrutiny, free from political prejudice. The expenses scandal was a seismic moment for our political system. The dramatic events of the past few days should similarly be a catalyst for serious debate not only about the conduct of News International but the power and responsibility of the media. A healthy democracy depends on the professionalism and integrity of the vast majority of journalists, editors, executives and proprietors. But it also depends on the courage of politicians to stand up for the public interest free from undue pressure or fear of reprisal. Let the debate begin."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
