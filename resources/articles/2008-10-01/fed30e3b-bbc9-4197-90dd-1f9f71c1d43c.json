The first 13 places in the men's race were filled by nine Kenyans and four Ethiopians. The first European was a Dutchman who ran 2hr 13min 51sec, which might have won him a British championship about 40 years ago. Prior to the marathon the city hosted this year's European Athletics Convention and on Saturday I took part in a discussion designed to examine the state of the sport in its traditional heartland. Tables were produced, performances analysed and trends were sought and one thing was abundantly clear - European men seem to have stopped running! Actually, that may be too positive a statement because it appears that in some areas they are going backwards. In recent times it has been difficult for European men to strike gold at the Olympics. In Beijing it proved almost impossible to win one medal on the track save for the Russian men's 4 x 400 metres relay team. The 20km and 50km walks still provide medals, but that is presumably because African athletes have not yet turned their attentions to events where the goal is not to run. In the field European men more than held their own but the track has become a foreboding arena dominated by Caribbean and American sprinters and African distance runners who are leaving the Europeans behind to such an extent that in certain events in many countries they just don't seem to be trying any more. Britain is faring better than most but a quick look at the distance events shows how far things have slipped in the last 10 years. Since September 1998 no one has managed to get into the top 10 best British times in the marathon, steeplechase or 10,000m. Mo Farah is the only athlete to have got into the top 10 at 5,000m and similarly Michael East in the 1500m and James McIlroy in the 800m. Just three names in the last 10 years. Of the other 47 in these five events, 12 were in the 1970s, 30 in the 80s and 15 in the 90s. Yes I know, statistics, but they represent quite starkly what has happened. It's a trend reflected all over Europe. My contention at the weekend was that despite the gloomy picture there was no need to give up the ghost in the middle-distance events but our men in particular need more help and support than is currently on offer from many federations. To his credit UKA's chief executive, Niels de Vos, has already highlighted it as an area requiring urgent attention from the new performance director, Charles van Commenee. I'm sure he will be open to ideas from all interested parties but one area where the European Athletic Association could be more helpful is in the competition set up. If you're going to ask young athletes to train over 100 miles a week year on year and devote all their waking hours to distance running then there has to be more than just the opportunity to get your end kicked in by Kenyan and Ethiopian athletes once a year in a Grand Prix race or the prospect of a European medal once every four years. If something's not done fairly quickly European men in the 5,000m, 10,000m, steeple chase and marathon will become a rarity. At 800m and 1500m the picture is less bleak, but nonetheless a more varied competitive opportunity than countless paced races must be offered to the up and coming athletes. There are many other factors involved such as coaching, the size of the talent pool and shifting cultural influences but surely these apply to boys and young men in other sports too? Hundreds of thousands set off down the road in a multitude of mass partition events across Europe every year, as happened in Amsterdam on Sunday, but very few of them want to continue running. The Dutch famously have the story of a little boy who stuck his finger in the dyke to hold off the impending deluge of water. European men's track has not quite been washed away yet but the young boy needs some help before he gets tired of it all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
