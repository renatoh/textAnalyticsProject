Scientists of the space agency\u2019s historic New Horizons mission on Friday announced the discoveries with visible delight, with lead investigator Alan Stern declaring the Pluto system a \u201cscientific wonderland\u201d. In a new set of high-resolution images of the dwarf planet\u2019s surface, Stern and researcher Bill McKinnon showed evidence of nitrogen moving and spreading through a vast plain near the edge of Pluto\u2019s large, heart-shaped region. McKinnon pointed out \u201ca pattern that indicates the flow of viscous ice\u201d that appears to move \u201cjust like glacial flow on the Earth\u201d. While water ice on Pluto freezes to the point of immovable bedrock, nitrogen and methane ice are \u201csoft and malleable\u201d, he said. Swirling lines show what appears to be a world of icy movement: old craters breached and filling up with ice, mountains encrusted on the ages by the flows, and movements of ice around \u201cwhat look to be barrier islands\u201d, in McKinnon\u2019s words. The spacecraft\u2019s flight past Pluto \u2013 the first time humanity has ever inspected the former planet at close range \u2013 also provided new photos from behind the dwarf planet, and revealed a haze layer in its atmosphere that astounded the scientists. McKinnon said the team\u2019s leading theory for the formation of the plains and flows of ice is \u201cheat leaking out of the interior of Pluto\u201d \u2013 an internal energy driving change on its surface. He said that there may be an internal ocean, for example, emitting heat from below the surface and nitrogen ice. Researcher Mike Summers said the image, which shows a band of sunlight dissolving into a faint haze around Pluto, has forced scientists to \u201cbasically start from scratch\u201d in how they think about Pluto\u2019s atmosphere. \u201cThis is the image that almost brought tears to the eyes of the atmospheric scientists,\u201d Summers said, happy to have unexpected puzzles. The haze of small particles extends to at least 100 miles above the surface, he said, five times higher than models had predicted and a profound mystery for the time being. Summers said that the team believes the particles in this haze are responsible for Pluto\u2019s reddish hue \u2013 that they convert into tholins, a term that encompasses a wide range of substances that have been irradiated or lost their hydrogen. The tholins however are just one piece of the puzzle, he said, \u201cbut we do know that these substances are around and the reddish color is fairly distinctive.\u201d Researcher Cathy Olkin said Pluto\u2019s diverse regions and colorings could in part be explained by its long and eccentric orbit: a Plutonian year around the sun takes 248 Earth years, and its north pole is tilted to a 120-degree angle. \u201cSome parts are kind of baked\u201d by sunlight, Olkin said, while others receive the tholin haze \u201crain\u201d or higher or lower concentrations of methane and nitrogen, likely due to seasons. \u2018The beating heart of Pluto\u2019 Stern noted that the two lobes of Pluto\u2019s heart-shaped region are distinct, likely affected by the movement of nitrogen snow, perhaps by wind or sublimation. McKinnon suggested that the heart could be \u201ca supply zone\u201d or \u201creservoir\u201d for the atmosphere and geological activity on the planet. \u201cWe describe this poetically as the beating heart of Pluto,\u201d he said. McKinnon also showed off a new ice mountain range, named Hillary Montes after Mt Everest pioneer Sir Edmund Hillary, and \u201cthe very ancient, heavily cratered region informally called Cthulhu\u201d, after HP Lovecraft\u2019s fictional monster god. In this southern region, flows of ice \u201cseem to have moved and surrounded and embayed\u201d the mountains, he said, forming \u201ca lot of fine structure\u201d that differs from elsewhere on the dwarf planet. New Horizons may have also reached Pluto at a stage right before its atmosphere freezes up or vanishes entirely. Early data shows that Pluto\u2019s atmosphere has decreased by a factor of two in about two years \u2013 an \u201castonishing\u201d rate to shrink, Summers said. Stern added that some models had suggested that Pluto is on the verge of atmospheric collapse, and if that were the case then the mission had arrived just in time. \u201cIt would be an amazing coincidence,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there would be some on our team that would say \u2018I told you so.\u2019\u201d Stern and his fellow investigators also announced that they had found a massive and uniquely dense concentration of carbon monoxide in the smooth, heart-shaped region spanning a wide swath of Pluto\u2019s face. The new results follow a thrilling two weeks for the team, as researchers have received huge amounts of data from New Horizons\u2019 fly-by past Pluto, after a journey nine years and 3bn miles in the making. On 14 July, New Horizons flew within 7,700 miles of Pluto\u2019s surface, a fly-by that made the US the only nation to have visited every planet in the classical solar system. Last week Nasa revealed high-resolution images of Pluto\u2019s frozen plains and hillocks, a region that abuts 11,00ft ice mountains and was described by one scientist as \u201chard-to-explain terrain\u201d. Without craters and threaded with strange troughs and trenches, the images suggested that Pluto remains very geologically active. The absence of craters likely means the plains and nearby mountain range could be only 100m years old, younger than the Himalayas on Earth and extraordinarily new compared to the 4.6bn years of the solar system. Powered by decaying plutonium, New Horizons is now more than 7m miles past Pluto, and could continue to explore the Kuiper Belt and beyond for another two decades. Stern said that the team has only downloaded about 5% of the data collected by the spacecraft. The space agency announced on Thursday that its Kepler mission has found an \u201cEarth 2.0\u201d , the exoplanet closest to our world\u2019s size, orbit and sun yet discovered."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
