Distractions abound but here is the bottom line. Never mind race. Everyone donates for a reason. Often that reason is access or influence. If we all agree that undue influence over the political system is a bad thing, change needs to happen. But how hard is it really? Three professors of law, Graeme Orr of the University of Queensland, Anne Twomey of the University of Sydney and George Williams of the University of New South Wales provided their opinions. What are the limitations? The NSW Liberal government tried to ban donations from all but individuals on the electoral roll (an option still favoured by Malcolm Turnbull). This was struck down in the NSW Unions case as constitutionally invalid by the high court in 2013 on the basis it breached the implied freedom of political communication in the constitution. Twomey says the judges took the view that there were many in the community who are not electors, but who are governed and affected by the decisions of government. \u201c[The view was] they have a legitimate interest in governmental action and the direction of its policy and may seek to influence the outcome of elections,\u201d Twomey said. \u201cThis includes unions and corporations. Any ban at the commonwealth level would face the same constitutional problems (unless the high court were to change its approach).\u201d But in a later case, the high court upheld the validity of the NSW ban on political donations by property developers and the imposition of caps upon political donations. \u201cThis tells us that where there is a legitimate reason to do so (for example a serious risk of corruption), the parliament may enact laws to ban donations from particular groups,\u201d Twomey said. \u201cHence, a ban on foreign donations may be permissible, if it is seen as being supported by a legitimate concern about foreign influence over Australian elections.\u201d While the Coalition has resisted any donations reform thus far, Labor has called for a ban on foreign donors, so let\u2019s start there. Foreigner money flows There is an oft-quoted claim \u2013 I have reported it in the past \u2013 that 66% of the world bans all foreign donations. But Orr says many countries included in that 66% regulate donations but do not have an outright ban. \u201cFor example, France only bans contributions from foreign states or foreign parties,\u201d Orr said. \u201cSweden\u2019s rule just criminalises money from foreign states attempting influence. Canada explicitly permits permanent residents to donate.\u201d So the world is not at one on this. But while we recently discovered UK and American investors are the biggest buyers of our agricultural land \u2013 well ahead of China \u2013 there is no telling who are the top 10 foreign donors to Australian political parties because we do not classify them. Foreign and domestic donations are treated the same. That is, parties and donors have to declare but all we see is a name or company name, an address and a phone number. This creates an extraordinary opaqueness in the financial disclosure list, which is broad but shallow. Transparency would be a start. Orr says while the law reaches outside our borders to limit activity affecting Australia, if a foreigner breaches such a law, enforcement is difficult. He believes banning foreigners is like banning property developers. \u201cIt\u2019s too piecemeal,\u201d Orr says. \u201cComprehensive reform would cap donations and expenditure.\u201d It\u2019s all about the domestic donation system While the Coalition has argued the Dastyari case is about payment rather than a donation, a number of Coalition MPs (transport minister Darren Chester, trade minister Steve Ciobo and Craig Kelly) have been open to the Turnbull option to ban all donations from anyone other than on the electoral roll. But after the two court cases, is it constitutionally possible? Williams says no. \u201cThis is ruled out by the 2013 high court decision in the Unions NSW case,\u201d he said. Orr says \u201cmaybe\u201d. \u201cI believe the court would uphold a Canadian model where only citizens and permanent residents can donate and then subject to caps,\u201d Orr said. \u201cWithout caps, a [Gina] Rinehart or [Clive] Palmer could wield even more influence.\u201d Third parties or the GetUp clause Turnbull also wants to rein in third-party activists like GetUp. In answer, Liberal senator Cory Bernardi has started Australian Conservatives. He claims more than 50,000 potential foot soldiers have registered online but his effect on the next election remains unclear. Other third-party campaigning examples include the unions\u2019 campaign against WorkChoices, the mining industry\u2019s against the mining tax, or the clubs\u2019 campaign against poker machine reform. Williams says while a ban on third parties would probably not work, limiting their contributions is possible. \u201cThe key here is to bring about a regime that creates a fair and level playing field,\u201d Williams said. \u201cTo ban third parties from participating in this way in the process would likely be invalid, but on the other hand appropriate limits and caps could be imposed.\u201d Twomey also says the high court would be likely to strike down laws banning third parties from campaigning. \u201cHowever, placing caps on their campaign expenditure would probably be valid, as long as the caps were not so low that they could not reasonably participate in political communication,\u201d said Twomey. Orr says regulating \u201cthird parties\u201d is only fair, even though it is complex. \u201cBut it is constitutionally OK provided the caps are reasonable and the regulated \u2018election period\u2019 is not too broad,\u201d Orr said. \u201cThis \u2018period\u2019 is harder to fix without a fixed election date nationally but the UK manages it.\u201d Put a lid on it If there is a clear consensus on political donations, it is around limits on funding rather than outright bans. Twomey says upholding caps on donations is important because \u201cit is hard to acquire influence if your donation is only as valuable as that of hundreds or thousands of others\u201d. \u201cOne effective way of lessening or eliminating undue influence through donations is by capping it at a relatively low level ($5,000 in NSW) so that the donation of a large company or union of $5,000 is worth the same as the donation of any individual or small business of $5,000,\u201d Twomey says. Williams says for this complex area of law, there is a clear way through which will produce an effective and legally viable regime to regulate political donations. \u201cThe answer is not to ban corporate and union donors, but to limit donations from all sources to a reasonable level, say $5,000,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThis would limit the ability of any donor to exercise undue influence. It is possible to ban certain donors, but only where it can be shown that there is a danger that donations from that source may corrupt or otherwise damage the political process.\u201d Facts, says Orr, more facts and basic principles. \u201cMost of all, we need a discussion of principles \u2013 the need to balance equality, integrity and liberty whilst resourcing politics,\u201d says Orr. \u201cAnd then modelling of the effect on different sides of politics, and of the need for extra public funding. The freedom of association of Labor/unions is a big hurdle for bipartisan reform here. And while public funding is \u2018clean\u2019 money, taxpayers have to be convinced the medicine is needed.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
