The teenager has yet to make his senior debut and has played for the reserves only spasmodically but United have borrowed him with a view to a permanent deal. \"All I had to do was decide whether I wanted to accept the invitation to go on loan,\" said Steele, who had a week's trial at Old Trafford this season and played twice for the youth team. \"I can't wait.\" Barry Fry, the Peterborough manager, said: \"I think he's an England goalkeeper in the making; the best thing about him is he's so level-headed and keeps his feet firmly on the ground. \"There aren't many good English goalies about at that age, and that's why United have been so persistent. If they do make a bid for him, and I wouldn't be at all surprised, it will take an awful lot of money to take him away from us.\" The Football Association has defended the referee Steve Dunn's decision to deny Derby a last-minute winner in the 2-2 draw with Manchester United, disallowing Malcolm Christie's effort on the ground that he had kicked the ball out of Fabien Barthez's grasp. \"The referee was perfectly correct to take such action under the laws of the game,\" its statement read. \"They clearly state, 'the goalkeeper is considered to be in control of the ball by [deliberately] touching it with any part of his hand or arms'.\" Birmingham expect to complete the loan signing of the Wimbledon midfielder Michael Hughes on Thursday. \"Michael was going to sign today but his [calf] injury means that there is no urgency,\" their manager Steve Bruce said yesterday. \"We want to check on his fitness.\" West Ham are hoping to sign the former Millwall and Liverpool defender Phil Babb on a free transfer once the 31-year- old's contract expires at Sporting Lisbon in the summer. Coventry have turned down West Bromwich Albion's offer to take back their former striker Lee Hughes on loan. \"There is no way that we would consider loaning one of our players, especially to a promotion rival,\" said Mike McGinnity, the City chairman. West Brom's chairman Paul Thompson has been elected to the Football League board in place of the former Coventry chairman Bryan Richardson, who stood down last month. Velibor Vasovic, Ajax's 1971 European Cup-winning captain captain and a Yugoslav international, died of heart failure yesterday. He was 63."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
