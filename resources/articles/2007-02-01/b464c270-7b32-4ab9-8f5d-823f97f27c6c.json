But these are not the only risks of whole-body computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Abnormalities detected by scanning - such as brain aneurysms - may never cause any problems, but detection of these \"incidentalomas\" can expose people to the risks of treatment, or leave them extremely anxious if treatment is impossible or inadvisable. Had David Bodanis discovered he had an incidentaloma, he might not have felt so reassured. There is little evidence to show that screening well people with whole-body scans does more good than harm. The Department of Health has launched an inquiry to assess whether health MOTs involving whole-body CT scans offer benefits in excess of the risk of radiation exposure. Anyone purchasing a full health MOT should be, like any patient, informed of both its benefits and risks. Dr Rustam al-Shahi Salman Dr William Whiteley Professor Charles Warlow Western General hospital, Edinburgh How lucky is your fully fit and healthy journalist, David Bodanis, to be given a (no doubt free) MRI scan on demand. I have a friend who has been seriously chronically ill for seven years. She is housebound and unable to work. When she finally got to see a neurologist she was referred immediately for an MRI scan. But the hospital cancelled her scan on the basis that \"others were in greater need\". It's important to understand how the private sector is \"helping\" the NHS. Bupa and others advertise their MRI scans to the people who need them least but can pay the most - the \"worried well\". Meantime the really ill who can't afford their own scans are left to rot.
