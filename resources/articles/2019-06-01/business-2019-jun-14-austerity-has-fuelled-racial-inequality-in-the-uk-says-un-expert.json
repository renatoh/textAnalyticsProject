National debates in the aftermath of the EU referendum \u201camplified racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in the UK\u201d said Tendayi Achiume, the UN\u2019s special rapporteur on racism. \u201cPublic and private actors have played dangerous roles in fuelling intolerance. Among them, politicians and media outlets deserve special attention given the significant influence they command in society,\u201d she said, without naming the politicians or media outlets she had in mind. It is the second highly critical UN report on UK government policy to be published in the last month, after a UN poverty expert compared Conservative welfare policies to the creation of 19th-century workhouses and said the UK\u2019s poorest people faced lives that would be \u201csolitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short\u201d unless austerity was ended. Achiume completed her research in 11 days in the UK last year, visiting seven cities and two detention centres. She said austerity measures had been \u201cdisproportionately detrimental to members of racial and ethnic minority communities, who are also the hardest hit by unemployment.\u201d The report cites research from the Equality and Human Rights Commission estimating that by 2022 black households will have seen a 5% loss in income because of austerity measures, double the loss for white households. Despite the existence of a legal framework devoted to combating racial discrimination, Achiume said race and ethnicity \u201ccontinue to determine the life chances and wellbeing of people in Britain in ways that are unacceptable and, in many cases, unlawful.\u201d Achiume, a professor of law at the University of California, Los Angeles, said a hostile environment \u201costensibly created for, and formally restricted to, irregular immigrants is in effect a hostile environment for all racial and ethnic communities and individuals in the United Kingdom.\u201d She added: \u201cThe UK\u2019s immigration enforcement strategy relies on private citizens and civil servants to do frontline immigration enforcement, effectively transforming places like hospitals, banks and private residences into border checkpoints. In a broader context of national anti-immigrant anxiety, the predictable result of the UK government\u2019s immigration policy and enforcement is racial discrimination and radicalised exclusion. The Windrush scandal is a glaring example.\u201d Chai Patel, the legal policy director at the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, said: \u201cWe are in violation of international human rights law because of Theresa May\u2019s hostile environment. The priority of our next prime minister must be to free the country from that toxic legacy.\u201d David Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham, said: \u201cDecent people across the country will be ashamed that the British government is now receiving international condemnation from the UN, in particular for the hostile environment which turns doctors and landlords into border enforcement officials. \u201cThe gruesome mishandling and abuse of the Windrush generation by the Home Office is unsurprisingly highlighted in the report, but it is just one of many failings which highlight the depth and breadth of Theresa May\u2019s toxic legacy.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
