Wigan, for one, will be thinking they really should do it more often after a convincing 2-0 victory in a full-blooded match that left both teams with 10 players on the pitch and Roberto Mart\u00ednez's men with their first win in six in the league. Mart\u00ednez described this as \"a complete away performance\", as Wolves were out-muscled and out-manoeuvred. Charles N'Zogbia was the best player on the pitch, scorer of the second goal and a constant roving menace from the right wing. \"We all speak about Charlie's quality, but today it was his work rate,\" Mart\u00ednez said. \"He was contagious. Charlie has been in really good form all season and you can see he's in a good moment of his career and he will carry on getting better.\" Mick McCarthy fingered the sending-off of Richard Stearman with the teams level as the key moment in the match: \"The sending-off was a sending-off,\" McCarthy said. \"As a young player you do things and wonder why afterwards. I'm sure he will. The sending-off had a huge bearing on that game.\" As did a powder-puff Wolves attack's inability to find the glass chin of a Wigan defence that has conceded more goals than any other in the Premier League. The recalled Sylvan Ebanks-Blake has yet to score from open play this season but he had what would be Wolves' best chance of the match after 19 minutes: put through clear on goal by Nenad Milijas's cute, threaded pass, Ebanks-Blake could only prod his effort weakly wide. Wigan had already looked the more dangerous team before Stearman's dismissal, which came in added time at the end of the first half. Chasing Michael Mancienne's hacked clearance, the young right-back grabbed the shirt of the impressive young Scotsman signed from Hamilton last July, James McCarthy, and Howard Webb pointed to the spot. A penalty seemed fair; a second yellow for Stearman was perhaps harsh. Wolves were briefly redeemed, however, as Hugo Rodallega's low spot-kick was palmed out by the excellent Marcus Hahnemann. After half-time, Wigan continued to have the better of things and the opening goal duly arrived on 60 minutes, scored by McCarthy, who slotted the ball calmly home after Hahnemann had blocked bravely at the feet of the slippery Rodallega. This was McCarthy's first Premier League start. \"Today he showed what he's capable of,\" Mart\u00ednez said of the 19-year-old. \"He is an extremely talented player.\" The architect of the goal was the increasingly dominant N'Zogbia, whose muscular trickery on the right was proving too much for Stephen Ward. Twenty minutes into the second half, Hendry Thomas received his second booking, this time for a sloppy late tackle on Ward, but N'Zogbia would not be denied. Picking the ball up from Rodallega 30 yards from goal, he weaved his way irresistibly across the left edge of the penalty area and finished low into the far corner. Mart\u00ednez may have been left praising the resilience of his defence, but it was his attacking riches, in N'Zogbia and Rodallega, that made Wolves look worryingly second rate. THE FANS' PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT Tim Spiers, Observer reader It was a scrappy first half; we were completely overrun in midfield and after the red card never looked like getting anything. It was definitely a penalty but never a booking. That was typical of Howard Webb, who wanted to be the centre of attention. January wasn't important for us until today \u2013 it's now apparent that we have too many Championship players. If we sign quality wide men and a strike partner for Doyle, we'll be OK. There are at least three teams worse than us. The fan's player ratings Kirkland 7; Melchiot 7, Caldwell 8, Bramble 7, Figueroa 6; N'Zogbia 9, Thomas 6, Diame 6, McCarthy 8 (Sinclair 90 n/a); Scharner 6 (Gomez 47 7); Rodallega 6 Mark Ashurst, Observer reader A much-needed performance and clean sheet after Old Trafford. For his first game, Caldwell looks like the organiser at the back that we've been missing. McCarthy was outstanding on his debut and has a bright future \u2013 though N'Zogbia shaded man of the match. We must have had 15 shots so Wolves can't complain. We need to consolidate in mid-table but at the same time we're in transition, trimming the wages and investing in younger players like McCarthy. The fan's player ratings Hahnemann 8; Stearman 4, Craddock 6, Mancienne 6, Ward 8; Foley 5, Henry 6, Milijas 6 (Surman 82 n/a), Jarvis 5 (Jones 46 6); Doyle 7, Ebanks-Blake 6 (Iwelumo 68 5) TO TAKE PART IN THE FANS' VERDICT, EMAIL FANS.PREMIER@OBSERVER.CO.UK"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
