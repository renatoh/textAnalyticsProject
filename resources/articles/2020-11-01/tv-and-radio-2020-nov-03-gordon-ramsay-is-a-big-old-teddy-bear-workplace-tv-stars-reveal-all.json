We had the benefit of seeing Educating Essex before we did ours. Our headteacher, Johnny Mitchell, told us Channel 4 was interested, but at that point, you don\u2019t know what your personal involvement will be. I just thought it was an opportunity for people to see a school that was doing a good job and cared deeply about its community. It was strange to be greeted at work by someone from Channel 4 putting a microphone in your face but it becomes second nature. The people from the production company were phenomenal. They were in the school for so long that we developed a relationship. Eventually, they felt like colleagues. I\u2019m still in touch with a lot of them. And then the moment with Musharaf happened. I didn\u2019t even really think about it until afterwards because, as a teacher, you just do it. But I came out of the classroom and the executive producer said to me: \u201cOh my God! The guys in the gallery are all crying.\u201d I remain incredibly proud of Musharaf, and I feel humbled that I was a small part of that. Teachers up and down the country do these sorts of things every day. You\u2019re trying something new to make something stick. And whether the breakthrough is as profound as that or just a student understanding how to use a full stop, it\u2019s the same thing. It\u2019s seeing a light go on. I still see Mushy quite often. They showed the final episode again earlier this year, so I dropped him a message. He does a job that involves public speaking. I think lots of the kids at the school see him as this sort of mythical creature \u2013 his presence remains. He\u2019s an adult now, though, with a thick beard. In 2018, I was made headteacher. It wasn\u2019t connected to the programme \u2013 it wasn\u2019t, you know: \u201cBecause of what happened in episode eight of Educating Yorkshire, we must give this man a headteacher\u2019s job.\u201d It\u2019s a brilliant job \u2013 challenging but also a privilege and a pleasure. Hayley Pearce, The Call Centre Best known for: excellent brews and hyperactive office banter. I was so young, and I didn\u2019t understand how big it was going to be. But it was a brilliant office to work in, so we knew it would be fun. For series two, people started wearing eyelashes to work and making an effort. But the film crew were there for about eight months, and we got so used to them being around that they became our friends anyway. I work in TV now, so I understand it\u2019s part of their job to befriend you because that means you can open up on camera. So many people think we must have been acting. But none of it was set up. You\u2019ve got to be yourself. Now, I\u2019m sure if I was to watch The Call Centre back, I\u2019d cringe. But everyone else found it hilarious. When it first screened, it was massive. The clubs and bars in Swansea all opened, and we had a big premiere. I don\u2019t regret a thing. They were the best days of my life, pushing that trolley around. And then the call centre moved to India for the second series, so I lived there for three months. Who gets to do things like that? The producers used to say to me: \u201cYou\u2019re really good on camera.\u201d So people started thinking about stuff they could do with me on my own. Just before I went to India, I had a call from a producer saying she wanted to do a documentary just with me. I had a one-off, half-hour episode on tanning. That did well, so they wanted to do a series. And now here I am, four series on. I\u2019m still a normal working-class girl but I went from pushing a trolley to being a TV presenter. I still work in offices and call centres. I\u2019ve been lucky to have bosses who\u2019ve been cool with me having time off for filming. Some people have asked me why I still call myself Hayley the Tea Lady on social media. But it\u2019s because that\u2019s where it all started. If people didn\u2019t still come up to me and say: \u201cOh my God, you\u2019re the tea lady from The Call Centre,\u201d I would have got rid! It baffles me because it was so long ago now. But people still remember it. Momma Cherri, Ramsay\u2019s Kitchen Nightmares Best known for: cooking mouth-watering soul food and intimidating Gordon Ramsay slightly. The restaurant needed a boost, and reality TV was becoming a thing. My first thought was going on Wife Swap. I thought that whoever the other wife was would have to work in the restaurant and then it would get noticed. But my husband wasn\u2019t really up for that. And then, out of the blue, a letter came from Channel 4. The producer said to me: \u201cGordon is very particular. What makes you think your food is better than anyone else\u2019s?\u201d I said: \u201cHe can\u2019t fry no chicken.\u201d The first thing Gordon said was: \u201cDamn, this place is small.\u201d He\u2019s a big guy. He could hardly get through the door. I had watched the first series and seen the way he talked to people. So I said to him: \u201cGordon, do you swear at your mother? Well, I\u2019m the momma!\u201d I made him a big plate of food, and he came upstairs and said: \u201cThis is the first time on this show that I have ever finished a plate.\u201d So I grabbed the plate off him. I didn\u2019t know if they were going to accept me on the show but I wanted to take a picture of that plate. I fed Gordon Ramsay and he cleaned his plate. I figured if nothing else, that was going to be my tagline. I loved Gordon. He\u2019s got his facade, but he ain\u2019t nothing but a big old teddy bear underneath. And because I respected him, I thought: \u201cWhy would I get him into my business and then argue with him?\u201d I needed help and he recognised that. So he didn\u2019t get no arguments out of me. There was some backchat, but only when I was joking with him. The final show was a completely fair representation of what happened. When they came back, things had kind of fallen a bit. I was on my book tour and was busy with other things. And we went from doing 40 covers a night to 150. Things had taken off and everybody was jumping on the Momma Cherri bandwagon. Everybody wanted a piece of the pie. The bank manager was well into us. We needed a loan to keep it growing. Then, 2008 hit and there was a recession. I should have closed then, but I\u2019m not someone who gives up. My daughter sold her flat and we did everything we could. My husband and I went bankrupt. I have no regrets at all. I wouldn\u2019t be able to be doing what I\u2019m doing now if I hadn\u2019t had that restaurant. I wish it hadn\u2019t closed but the positives outweigh the negatives. At the moment, I have a YouTube cooking channel and I do Airbnb experiences so people can come and learn to cook soul food with me. And I\u2019m working with a food bank in Brighton called City Food Share. They fund me to cook about 70 meals a week. And we give people who use food banks recipes and ideas about what they can do with raw produce. I love it \u2013 it\u2019s how I express myself. James Edwards, The Secret Life of the Zoo Best known for: being lead keeper at Chester zoo. Exemplary elephant management. I\u2019m probably your quintessential \u201cnot very good with people, so I work with animals\u201d kind of person. So it\u2019s been a bit of a shock to have people paying me compliments. I refused to believe it for a time, but I\u2019ve come to accept now that it\u2019s been quite popular, so I must be doing something right. For the most part, the crew have been great at working around us. It\u2019s just that initial period when they first come down, and they think they\u2019re going to get certain things straight away. And that\u2019s not how it works \u2013 although they\u2019re in captivity, these are wild animals, and they\u2019re going to do whatever they want really. The big ones are births. Obviously, the crews are desperate to catch births on film. But with elephants, it\u2019s a 22-month pregnancy with a large potential window at the end. So, for example, it could be any time between, say, June and August. And every day, someone in the crew will be asking: \u201cIs it going to be today?\u201d But it happens when it happens, and we\u2019re used to that. But I think for them it\u2019s a bit strange not knowing. We\u2019ve got to be very careful about what the crews can and can\u2019t do. And if they\u2019re new to the job, they\u2019ll wander off sometimes. So you have to say: \u201cNo, don\u2019t go near that elephant!\u201d You\u2019ve got to be very careful around these animals. We\u2019re pretty strict because elephants can be so dangerous. Your hair stands on end sometimes. But we\u2019re used to keeping the public safe so it\u2019s not all that different from that really. I\u2019ve seen so many comments from people who didn\u2019t like zoos but have watched the show and had their minds changed. People have certain impressions about what zoos are and a lot of that is based on things they may have seen and heard years ago when zoos were very different. And there probably still are zoos like that, but at places like Chester, we\u2019re really pushing boundaries and when people see that on TV they rethink. That\u2019s probably one of the biggest benefits that\u2019s come from the show. It\u2019s not naturally something I\u2019d have put my hand up to do \u2013 it\u2019s not my personality at all. But the more I\u2019ve done it, the more I\u2019ve enjoyed it. And things have come from it. Earlier this year when the zoo was closed during the first lockdown, there was a campaign to get the government to overturn the decision. It was hairy for a bit, and we\u2019ve had redundancies. Zoos were meant to stay shut but other things like theme parks were open. It was a really strange decision. And because I was on the show I went on the BBC and This Morning to talk about it. We actually got the government to change its policy and get zoos open again. That was a proud moment.
