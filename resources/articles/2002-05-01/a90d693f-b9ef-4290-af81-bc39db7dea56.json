Yesterday's formal unseating of the lord chancellor Lord Irvine and the ceremonial handing of decision-making on the future of the Lords from the executive to parliament is part of a wider picture. In internal debate over the past few months, Blairites had become reluctantly convinced that Labour's second unexpectedly large Commons majority required No 10 to rethink its relationship with parliament and electorate. Governing through an increasingly wayward group of lobby journalists had clearly collapsed. Equally last summer's Labour backbench rebellion over the whips' imposition of Labour nominees for the select committee chairmanships revealed a new spirit of independence inside the parliamentary Labour party. The Lords was also becoming more difficult to control. The Blairites decided that the once-arid constitutional debate about executive, prime minister and parliament had gained a wider currency. It was infecting the wider perception of Blair. Over the past few weeks, disparate straws in the wind have swirled around. Tony Blair suddenly agreed to appear in front of the chairmen of select committees twice a year. He is to do a TV interview with Jeremy Paxman to be screened over three nights from tonight. The daily briefings with political journalists are to be refashioned. The leader of the Lords, Lord Williams, has presented radical changes to working practices of the Lords which are due to be debated on May 21. They could make the Lords an effective scrutineer of European legislation, as well as a conduit for long-delayed law commission bills. The leader of the house, Robin Cook, in turn presented a radical paper revising the hours and procedures of the Commons, as well as the resources of select committees. And now the final bullet has been bitten. The government's minimalist plans for Lords reform, first set out in a royal commission by Lord Wakeham three years ago and then echoed in Lord Irvine's white paper, Completing the Reform, last November, were yesterday ditched. Lords Wakeham and Irvine had proposed that only 20% of a future elected upper chamber should be elected, the Commons should remain supreme, and 60% of peers be appointed by the political parties. Wakeham and Irvine were convinced the public would not stomach any more elected politicians. Their proposals, they fondly hoped, located the centre of gravity in parliament. If there was a moment when this supposed consensus emerged as an illusion it was Lord Irvine's performance in front of Labour MPs three months ago. As he floundered, he had to be rescued by Lord Williams. Labour high command had clearly misread a long-term change of mood inside the Commons. For many years Labour radicals had been unicameralists, or at least jealously preserved the pre-eminence of the Commons. But over the past decade, a group of Labour MPs such as Graham Allen, Tony Wright, Fiona Mactaggart, Mark Fisher and Gordon Prentice argued fiercely for a largely elected second chamber. Bereft of other radical goals, the ideas of Charter 88 took root. Two surveys, one conducted by the public administration select committee and another by Mr Allen showed most Labour MPs wanted a largely elected second chamber. The old view that such a change would undermine the pre-eminence of the Commons was losing ground. The big issue was no longer the balance of power between the two chambers, but between executive and parliament. This view was given a fillip by a sudden volte face by the Conservatives. The shadow cabinet - ignoring the views of Tory peers - switched from dogged defence of the hereditary peerage to support for an 80% elected chamber. The momentum was given a further shove by a strongly argued report from Tony Wright's public administration committee. The all-party report called for 60% elected chamber, in which peers served two five-year terms. The honorary peerage, the bishoprics and the law lords would be abolished. The long-destined death knell was finally sounded when the responses to the government consultation paper revealed 89% of those replying favoured a second chamber in which the majority of its members were elected. Sniffing victory, Lady Williams, the Liberal Democrat leader, and Lord Strathclyde, the Conservative leader, relaunched their call for a joint committee of both houses to examine the issues. The government had failed to create a consensus, and as a matter of principle, the executive should not alone decide the future of parliament, they argued. By this time Mr Cook and Lord Williams knew that inside cabinet the arguments were being won. Mr Blair, however, resisted putting government authority behind a package in which 50% of peers were elected. Such a bold move could have been defeated, and even risked Labour losing its programme as Labour peers - largely opposed to elections - rebelled. As a compromise, it was also agreed that peers and MPs should be given an indicative vote. Where the next move will take the British constitution, no one quite knows. But for the moment, the momentum is with the radicals."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
