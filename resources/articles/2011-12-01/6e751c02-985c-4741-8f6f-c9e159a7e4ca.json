Chelsea trail Roberto Mancini's visitors by 10 points with Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas having already conceded that it would be \"very difficult, if not impossible\" for his side to catch City if that gap were to be extended to 13 points. That has put greater emphasis on Chelsea maintaining recent encouraging form \u2013 they have won three of their last four games 3-0 \u2013 to ensure they remain in contention, although it has not been helped by reports of a divided camp. Villas-Boas banished Chelsea's reserve-team players from the main training centre at the club's complex in Cobham towards the end of last week, as he retreated further into the mentality of the siege. The manager had previously told Nicolas Anelka and Alex that they could not use the facility, after the pair submitted transfer requests, and has now moved the reserves over to the Academy building. The lockdown of the first-team building led to questions about Villas-Boas' attempts to instil harmony from top to bottom at the club. However, Mata, a \u00a323m signing from Valencia last summer, is confident Chelsea are in the right state to overcome City. Asked whether Chelsea could still catch City at the top, Mata said: \"I think it is not impossible for us. They have a big points advantage but I think it is not impossible. If we win against City we will have more confidence and the Premier League does not finish for another six months. Nothing is impossible. \"What we did at Newcastle last weekend can also give us more confidence in the league to play against City, which is a very big game for us. It will be very difficult for City to keep winning every game, so for us and the other teams, we just have to hope that they stop winning.\" Mata, who had sounded out his Spain and former Valencia team-mate David Silva prior to agreeing to swap the Mestalla for the Premier League, has grown accustomed to chasing the likes of Barcelona and Real Madrid in La Liga. Yet he considers the title race in England to be more competitive, with City leading a clutch of clubs capable of claiming the title. \"No, it is different,\" said Mata. \"There are a lot of clubs in England who are fighting for the title, whereas in Spain it is just two. \"It is very difficult for other teams to be like Barcelona. They have been together for three or four years. City are playing very well as well, but they have different kinds of players. Bar\u00e7a have some of the best players in the world. As a player, you have respect for Barcelona but you never have fear. You have to plan for a good game against them and to try to cause them problems. So no, we do not have any fear of Manchester City, especially because we're playing at home in this match but we do have the ultimate respect for them because they're the league leaders. Fear, though? Not at all.\" Confronting City represents a considerable challenge for Villas-Boas, who has seen his side come unstuck in their collisions with fellow contenders \u2013 Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool \u2013 over his brief tenure. \"City set an extreme standard of performance,\" said the manager. \"They have made one of the best starts ever to the Premier League and the further they go in the league with the amount of wins they're having, the more they'll believe this is their year. We'll have to see how much pressure Tottenham Hotspur can put on them, with that game in hand against Everton, and how United react as they try to defend their title against a direct Manchester rival. \"But City will understand the importance of the challenge we post them in this game. They've played at United, at Tottenham and at Liverpool, and now they come to Chelsea. \"If they get the result they want, a win, they will leave almost with the assurance that the Premier League title [race] is at least with one less team in the running. It would be difficult for us from 13 points behind but not impossible.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
