He stopped to roar so that rival stags would know he was around - especially the one near the edge of the loch who was holding a harem of hinds and their calves. Each time he roared I could see the breath form a cloud in the cold morning air. The resident stag had been busy warning off other stags, mainly by roaring, and chasing hinds that wandered too far. When the hinds were right he had mated with them and now it was so far into the rut that he had lost his peak condition. The young stag obviously thought he stood a chance to take over the hinds, or at least entice a few away. Then they stood 50 yards apart, both roaring continuously; both pawed the ground with their forelegs as if weighing up whether a fight would be worthwhile. Another stag was roaring from another part of the hill, but the two stags facing each other were preoccupied. They advanced towards each other. Sparring and fights often happen, although most challenges never reach physical contact as both stags have to be evenly matched for what could be a risky fight leading to broken antlers or injuries. Fights to the death are very rare. The stags met and walked side by side for about 50 yards. By then they were well away from the hinds and calves, who were totally ignoring the stags. All the calves were laid down or asleep while most of the hinds were grazing. I held my breath wondering if I would see a fight. Then as if to answer me, the young stag turned away and the resident stag gave a short, half-hearted chase and then gave up and went back to the hinds and calves."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
