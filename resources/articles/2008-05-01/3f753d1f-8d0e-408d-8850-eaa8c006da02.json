With a superior Premier League record in defence and attack there is no doubt that Manchester United have already outdone Chelsea. That knowledge, however, can sharpen the disquiet, because of one adverse trend that is all but unbroken as Sir Alex Ferguson faces this Champions League final. The Scot's record in direct encounters with Chelsea has been puny. Although he claimed to have been unaware that United had only two victories over them in competitive fixtures over the past five seasons, he would have had no need for statistics. He will still feel those disappointments in his bones and another defeat, in this fixture above all, would complete the anguish. By the same token, Chelsea see a final brimming with promise whenever they view it from that perspective. A victory would confer joyous amnesia. Trailing behind United in the past couple of seasons would seem like domestic trivia. The Champions League, after all, is the ultimate prize. That may be unfair, considering the trace of randomness in knockout competition, but it is the victorious clubs in this tournament who are remembered above all others. Since Chelsea have had by far the better of the head-to-head rivalry, Ferguson is obliged to identify the reasons for the pattern to be broken at the Luzhniki Stadium. Asked about the defeat in the 2007 FA Cup final, he said: \"We had played so many games with the same 11 or 12 players that we had no reserves to change the game. This year we have. That will make a difference.\" He also implied that there had been time to come up with a solution to the Chelsea conundrum since the Premier League title was retained on May 11. \"We have added more detail to our preparation in terms of how we have analysed Chelsea's games over the past year,\" he said. This evening we will learn whether he has cracked the Stamford Bridge code. A sceptic will ask why a cryptographer should be needed when there is no enigma. Chelsea are strong, resilient, keep enough men back to limit the scope of, say, Cristiano Ronaldo on the break and have sufficient talent to register eventually the goal or two they need. Nonetheless, there are reservations. Avram Grant is still perceived as a triallist in the Chelsea post. Ferguson argued that the callowness of the Israeli in the context of today's occasion would have no bearing on the outcome, but it did not slip his mind to mention that he himself was calm because this was the fourth European final of his career, a sequence inaugurated with Aberdeen's 2-1 defeat of Real Madrid to take the Cup Winners' Cup in 1983 in Gothenburg. Ferguson's audience was trusted to fill in the gap in his speech by recalling that each of the three finals so far was won. Until now, Grant's sole effort to secure a trophy for Chelsea in head-to-head conflict ended in him being out-thought by Juande Ramos in the Carling Cup final, with Tottenham Hotspur winning 2-1 at Wembley after extra-time. All the same, he blended into recent tradition by beating United at Stamford Bridge in the league. Whatever questions there are about his decision-making as he attempts to steer safely through the hairpin bends of tonight's final, Grant has the benefit of having a glut of Champions League winners on the books. There are half a dozen men with that distinction, although Claude Makelele and Ricardo Carvalho are the only ones confident of being in the starting line-up. The squad are a little older on average than United's and, although that might speak of the promise at Old Trafford, it adds, for the moment, to the formidable air that envelops Chelsea. Ferguson acknowledges their advantage in physical force and dwells instead on the belief that United can be victorious by keeping faith with their own fluid approach. But the rampaging power of, say, Michael Essien's bursts from his expected post at right-back cannot be disregarded. That increases the potency of Chelsea's midfield and Ferguson, in practice, will have been thinking about how it is to be countered. At 33 Paul Scholes, marvellous footballer as he is, will need support. Speculation that Ferguson might therefore field both Owen Hargreaves and Michael Carrick with him in that area does have a kind of cogency. United, roughly speaking, could thereby have a 4-3-3 formation to mirror Chelsea's. Someone would need to be sacrificed and, in view of the manager's use of Park Ji-sung in games of this type, Carlos Tevez may have to be a substitute. Whatever the tactical tweaks in midfield, the basis of United's durability exists in a redoubtable defence. As spearhead of Chelsea's attack, Didier Drogba employs the full range of talents but he has only one goal against Ferguson's team. Then again, it did settle last year's FA Cup final. Tonight's game is like that: open to contrasting arguments and interpretations. It may not be entertaining, but it should be intriguing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
