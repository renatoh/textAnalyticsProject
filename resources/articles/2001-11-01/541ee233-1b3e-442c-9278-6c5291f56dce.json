Bigger then than Pakistan or Sri Lanka last winter, or even an Ashes tour? Yup. Well, it is hard to argue with the England captain when he asserts that \"India are easily the hardest team to beat at home. There is no harder tour.\" The facts for England do not encourage optimism. In the 25 years since Tony Greig's England team beat that of Bishen Bedi 3-1, India have been beaten in just six of 29 home series (including one-off matches), one of those defeats coming in a series against South Africa that has to some extent been discredited. Earlier this year, they turned over an Australian team that ranks with the all-timers, in what many regard as the finest of all series. Hussain, though, is taking a side depleted from the summer by the retirement of Mike Atherton, and the absence for reasons of personal choice of Alec Stewart, Darren Gough, Andy Caddick and Robert Croft. He has a bowling attack that boasts Craig White as its most experienced seamer and Ashley Giles, the single spinner with any international experience, unsure of his fitness even to participate. He and his team will be taking on some mighty batting, not least the genius Sachin Tendulkar, and in Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh two of the top six spinners in the world. All this on pitches of their choice, in front of frantically partisan crowds, amid all the clamour that accompanies any tour to this cricket-daft country. So, it will be tough and, yes, Hussain's greatest challenge. \"Both as a player and as captain actually. I'm taking a young side away and it'll be bloody hard. India beat Australia and they have some extremely fine players. It is a very difficult place to play and is going to test me as a player. \"It is exactly what I need at this stage of my career, meaning simply that when things have all gone and I've retired I want to be able to say I went to India and I played against the side that beat Australia there. \"Everyone was sceptical last winter about our chances and are questioning them now. But give yourselves a go, that's what I'll be saying to my team, give yourself a go. Take on the challenge and see what happens.\" If the build-up to the tour - with genuine doubts that it would even take place because of fears about safety - was stressful, it will get no less so after the team arrive in Bombay in the early hours of tomorrow morning. They asked for security and, according to reports, they will get it. Armed guards will stand outside every hotel door, while players will be required to inform security officers before leaving the hotel and will be offered a security escort when they do. For their opening game at the Wankhede stadium in Bombay, fans are not allowed to bring mobile phones, bottles, radios, handbags, cigarettes or lighters and must carry food only in transparent packets. If England do have anything in their favour it is the venues, and the order in which they come. After three warm-up matches - similar to the tours last winter and more than adequate, in the view of the coach Duncan Fletcher. They will play the three-match series on the reel beginning in Mohali - a suburb of Chandighar and where the ground is surrounded by a dry moat - continuing in Ahmedabad and ending in Bangalore. The teams have never met at either of the first two venues and only twice at the third, where England lost once, albeit courtesy of some spectacularly unhinged umpiring, and drew once, so there is little history on which to draw. However, given that England's bowling strength would appear to rest with the seamers, it could be that Mohali represents their best chance of stealing a win. England have played at more northerly venues outside this country - Peshawar and Rawalpindi for example - but Mohali can get decidedly nippy at night during the winter and consequently there can be a heavy dewfall which tickles up the pitch. In each of the three Tests that Mohali has staged since 1994, seamers have managed to do the bulk of any damage, most recently when the New Zealander Dion Nash took six for 27 as India were bowled out for 83 two years ago. Given luck with the toss, England need to come out of the blocks hard and Matthew Hoggard may be the man to do it. Of all those with something to gain from this winter, he perhaps has the most: this, maybe, is where a career begins."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
