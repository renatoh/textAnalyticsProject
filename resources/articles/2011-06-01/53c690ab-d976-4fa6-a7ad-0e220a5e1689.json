The French finance minister is the first woman to hold the post. She takes over from Dominique Strauss-Kahn, beginning her five-year term on 5 July. After the announcement, she tweeted: \"The results are in: I am honored &amp; delighted the Board has entrusted me with the position of MD of the IMF!\" Earlier, the US officially endorsed her candidacy. Treasury secretary Tim Geithner called her an \"exceptional talent\" whose broad experience would \"provide invaluable leadership for this indispensable institution at a critical time for the global economy\". The chancellor, George Osborne, hailed Lagarde as \"good news for the global economy and for Britain\". He said: \"She is the best person for the job, which is why Britain was one of the first countries to propose her. She has been a strong advocate for countries tackling high budget deficits and living within their means.\" President Nicolas Sarkozy described the appointment as a \"victory for France\". But privately he was said to complain about the effect on his re-election battle next year, when he been counting on her as a measured presence. Instead, he is trying to replace her in a reshuffle on Wednesday morning. Her departure also leaves him vulnerable to attacks that the strong female cabinet presence he promised has evaporated. Sarkozy may also be wary of being too closely associated with Lagarde on the world stage, perhaps fearing that unpopular IMF measures will be associated with him in the eyes of the French electorate. That Dominique Strauss-Kahn was Sarkozy's political opponent was convenient, as it allowed the French president to keep a distance from unpopular IMF decisions. Lagarde has the support of most European states, and is seen as an ideal candidate to handle the IMF's bailout of weak eurozone countries. Many observers felt the time had come for a non-European but, despite initial coolness, India, China and Russia have backed Lagarde. She had the explicit support of states, including Indonesia and Egypt, representing more than half the IMF's 24 voting board members. Her closest competitor, Mexican central banker Agust\u00edn Carstens, won endorsements from Mexico, Canada and Australia. The executive board represents the 187 members of the IMF. Russian finance minister Alexei Kudrin told the Itar-Tass news agency: \"I think that she has all the necessary qualities, and we support her candidacy. She will be able to make this key international organization more dynamic and assure its future reform.\" Lagarde's appointment caps a tumultuous time for the IMF, currently led by Strauss-Kahn's deputy, John Lipsky, who before Strauss-Kahn's arrest for alleged attempted rape was planning to retire. Her first move was to support the IMF-backed plans for tough austerity measures to tackle Greece's debt. \"If there is one message I have to send tonight, it is to say the Greek opposition must join a national entente with the party that is in power,\" she told French TV channel TF1 minutes after appointment. Lagarde, 55, led the Chicago-based law firm Baker &amp; McKenzie before entering French politics in 2005. Emerging market countries initially fought hard to have one of their own claim the top IMF job, taken by a European since its creation at the end of the second world war. But with Europe in crisis, the French minister emerged as the clear favourite. Mohamed El-Erian, a former IMF official and now chief executive of Pimco, one of the world's largest bond investors, said: \"Her major priority is to restore legitimacy to an institution demoralised by the arrest of Strauss-Kahn, seen to be excessively influenced by political directives, and lack[ing] global legitimacy, especially among emerging economies. \"[Lagarde] needs to follow up on her promises to emerging economies, including removing nationality-based approaches to key appointments. She can start with the soon-to-be-vacant first deputy post which, traditionally, has been a US treasury decision.\" \"She needs to make the IMF more representative of today's global realities, restore technical rigor to its interactions with member countries, and prepare the balance sheet for the potential of some financial impairment on account of recent lending.\"\" Simon Tilford, chief economist at the Centre for European Reform, said: \"There's no doubt she is a talented politician, but I don't think this was the right choice for Europe or the IMF.\" He believed that the IMF's policy in Greece, supported by Lagarde, had failed, and appointing another European to the IMF sent the wrong signal to the rest of the world. \"You can't demand that these countries show greater responsibilities while continuing to exclude them from the top jobs.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
