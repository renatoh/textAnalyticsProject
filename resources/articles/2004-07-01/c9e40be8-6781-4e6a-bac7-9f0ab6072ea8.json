It expects to hear by the end of August whether it will become the first western oil firm to work in Iraq since the end of Saddam Hussein's regime. It has already effectively beaten off oil major Shell, which had a look at the tender documents but decided the contracts were not profitable enough. John Keeling, the chairman of Petrel, said last night that the other western oil companies had been chased away by security scares and political risk. \"The big companies have backed off because they are not sure how things are going to pan out. They cannot send their own staff because they can't get insurance for them. They would be wide open to attack because there is a lot of bitterness towards the US and Britain,\" said Mr Keeling. Petrel stands a chance of success, he believes, because it is listed on the Alternative Investment Market in London but is actually based in Dublin. It has also been actively involved in Iraq for many years and employs mainly local staff. Petrel is already in detailed technical discussions with the Iraqi oil ministry on the first of three tenders submitted for the Khurmala Dome, Hamrin, and Subba and Luhais fields. The combined output from these fields could be as high as 420,000 barrels a day, and when operating would have a \"lifting\" cost of just $1 a barrel. Two out of the three fields have never been developed before, while the third in the south of the country was bombed and badly damaged during the war. Petrel says it might be valued at only \u00a325m on the stock market but could easily raise cash for the oilfield development work. Petrel's \"Irishness\" is a plus, according to Mr Keeling, because it is regarded as being politically neutral. He explained: \"When [managing director] David Horgan last went to Iraq, he wore a bright green Irish rugby jersey. The Iraqis were all asking 'who is that lunatic?'\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
