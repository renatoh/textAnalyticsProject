Under the proposals, carriers will be offered help for losses suffered during the four days US airspace was closed after the September 11 attacks. \"We understand some compensation is necessary for the losses incurred by the industry for the four days when the US airspace was closed. Nothing more than that,\" said the EU transport commissioner, Loyola de Palacio. The proposal fell short of the requests made by EU carriers. The Association of European Airlines had been pushing for compensation for losses through September 19, saying that disruptions to service continued after the US airspace was reopened. The AEA estimates the attacks will cost European airlines 3.7bn euros (\u00a32.3bn) in lost revenues for the period to December, resulting in 108 aircraft being grounded and the loss of 20,000 direct jobs. In addition, the European commission proposes that European airlines be allowed longer government insurance guarantees covering terrorism and war risk and that governments take on the costs of increased security. \"We want there to be more safety and to say that these additional costs may be borne publicly,\" Ms de Palacio said. \"Only the uniform, effective application of security measures will enable all Europeans to continue to have confidence in EU skies and airports.\" Major European carriers have asked for state help so as not to be disadvantaged after the Bush administration agreed a $15bn (\u00a310.3bn) rescue package for American airlines. Routes of European airlines to the US and Middle East suffered drops in bookings of up to 30% since the attacks. But low-cost operators such as easyJet and Ryanair have opposed state aid. All the emergency measures will be submitted for possible approval to the 15 EU transport ministers, who meet in Luxembourg next Monday. Security measures proposed today would toughen controls in sensitive areas at airports, on passengers and their luggage, on cargo and mail and on the training of ground staff. But the commission stopped short of recommending armed security guards among passengers, a measure now before the US congress. In other proposals, the commission promised relaxed scrutiny of efforts by airlines to coordinate schedules or maintain service on less-travelled routes. Ms de Palacio could not say whether a Belgian government loan for the Belgian national airline, Sabena, could be permitted under EU rules. \"I cannot actually judge the current proposal communicated to us by the Belgian government,\" she said. But she repeated that general state aid for ailing airlines was prohibited. \"It's not state aid for some and not for others. No state aid for Sabena or any other company for that matter,\" she said. However, she noted that EU rules permitted aid for a limited period of time in exceptional circumstances. The commission said last week it had received formal notification from the Belgian government of 125m euros in bridging finance that it planned to give to Sabena."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
