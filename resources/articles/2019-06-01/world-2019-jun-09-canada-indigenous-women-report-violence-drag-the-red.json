Since 2014, Smith and her team at the Drag the Red initiative have used a small motor boat to drag the murky waters in the faint hope providing closure to grieving families. This week the commission\u2019s 1,200-page final report concluded that the murder and disappearance of Indigenous women and girls in Canada constituted a \u201crace-based genocide\u201d and laid out more than 200 policy recommendations for future action. But Smith and her team have no plans to end their work: tragedy continues to befall Indigenous families across the country. More than 130 Indigenous women and girls have gone missing or been killed since the inquiry began its work in 2016, according to a CBC News database. \u201cYes, the inquiry is important work. And yes, it\u2019s important for families to have their voices heard,\u201d said Smith. \u201cBut at the same time, it\u2019s important to start addressing this now and to stop the violence from happening.\u201d The commission\u2019s report was officially released on Monday at an emotional ceremony in Gatineau, Quebec, which brought together Indigenous leaders, families of murdered women and the survivors of abuse. Its pages chronicled generations of trauma against Indigenous peoples, including the disproportionate gender-based violence experienced by women and girls throughout the country. The gravity of discriminatory policies against Indigenous peoples meant that calling it \u201cgenocide\u201d was an \u201cinescapable conclusion\u201d, said the chief commissioner, Marion Buller. The report stressed that its recommendations were legally binding, but some of those on the front lines of the crisis \u2013 whose work spurred calls for an inquiry \u2013 are asking whether this time will be any different. Grassroots organizations across the country have long advocated for changes in policing, child welfare and education, but their calls have fallen on deaf ears. \u201cThere\u2019s a long list of reports and recommendations that could help us and they just sit on the shelves. And that\u2019s why I keep asking: \u2018What are you doing to implement those recommendations?\u201d said Lorelei Williams, a longtime advocate for missing and murdered women. Williams is still searching for her aunt, Belinda Williams who vanished in 1978; her cousin Tanya Holyk was murdered by the serial killer Robert Pickton in 1996. \u201cWe have this attention now with the national inquiry, but how long is that going to last for?\u201d she asked. \u201cAt the end of the day women are still going to go missing and are being murdered.\u201d Smith\u2019s work is also motived in part by personal loss. Her sister, Claudette Osborne, disappeared in 2008 and remains missing. The family had no resources to publicise her case and no institutional help. \u201cThe police said they needed evidence to search, and they didn\u2019t have any \u2013 so they weren\u2019t going to. It took them 10 days to actually start investigating my sister\u2019s case.\u201d The report sharply rebukes police services in Canada \u2013 especially the country\u2019s federal Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). \u201cThe continued racism and sexism by many RCMP officers directed at Indigenous peoples, the high rates of missing and murdered Indigenous women \u2026 have caused many Indigenous peoples and communities to lose trust and confidence in the Canadian justice system, the RCMP and police services in general,\u201d said the report. As a result of her poor experience with police, Smith and other activists took matters into their own hands. In 2014, when 15-year-old Tina Fontaine went missing, Smith gathered a group to scour the river for the young woman. Since then, Drag the Red has grown from 25 committed volunteers to hundreds. The organization has received boats as donations and in five years of dragging the river, they say they have helped in the recovery three bodies \u2013 two men and one woman \u2013 as well as pulling up human teeth and hair. They also help families react to the news of a missing loved one, including how to hold a vigil and how to organize. \u201cWe want people to know that we are actively on that river. We are actively searching the banks of the Red River,\u201d said Smith. \u201cIf you think you\u2019re going to put a body in that river, that it\u2019s not going to be found \u2013 think again.\u201d While Smith and Williams are hopeful the inquiry will have a lasting impact, the daily work of activism that underpins the report weighs heavily. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve taken an emotional beating. But at the end of the day, I\u2019m trying to get my missing aunt\u2019s picture out there. That\u2019s what keeps me going. I want to honour my cousin,\u201d said Williams. \u201cBut I also realize that the pain and the exhaustion I feel is nothing compared to what they, or the rest of the missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls, have gone through.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 11 June 2019 because an earlier version overstated the number of bodies Drag the Red was said to have recovered. Members of the organization say they have helped in the recovery three bodies. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
