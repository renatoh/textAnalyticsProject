The 34-year-old scored a triple-century for Surrey in their County Championship match against Leicestershire on Monday, the highest first-class score of his career. Pietersen confirmed that he would hold talks with England\u2019s new director of cricket immediately afterwards and posted a picture on Twitter of himself travelling to the meeting. However, the BBC reported on Monday night that the South African-born batsman has been told that he will not be selected for England again. \u201cWe understand that Kevin Pietersen has been told this evening that he won\u2019t be picked to play for England again,\u201d read a tweet from the BBC\u2019s Test Match Special Twitter account. The BBC\u2019s cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew added: \u201cI gather Strauss has confirmed to KP this evening that he will not be selected for England again.\u201d There was no immediate response from either Pietersen or Piers Morgan, who earlier in the day had hinted at what was to come. \u201cI can now reveal that Andrew Strauss and [ECB chief executive] Tom Harrison asked to see KP tonight. I believe to tell him he wouldn\u2019t play for England again,\u201d he tweeted while Pietersen was still at the crease on Monday afternoon. \u201cIf Strauss and Harrison still try to end KP\u2019s England career now, they are betraying England sport and the fans.\u201d The England &amp; Wales Cricket Board also kept its counsel, although the ECB\u2019s official Twitter account did tweet a vine of one of the 14 sixes hit by Pietersen against Leicestershire."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
