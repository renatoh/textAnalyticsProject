She was 23 at the time and had never set foot in the country. After the fall of the Taliban, post 9/11, her father worked as an adviser to the interim government, before he was elected president in 2014. Ghani become a regular visitor, exploring the country by making art, which for her is a peculiarly nerdy process. \u201cI love archives,\u201d says Ghani, who is now in her 40s. \u201cI once organised a conference on radical archives.\u201d She has even created her own: Index of the Disappeared. \u201cIt\u2019s an archive of the human cost of post 9/11 US policies.\u201d The archive covers a lot of things, from the US facility in Bagram where two Afghan civilians were murdered in 2002 to increased censorship and government secrecy in the US. The fruits of her latest rummagings \u2013 six years spent visiting the National Film Archive in Kabul \u2013 is a feature-length documentary, screening this weekend at Sheffield Doc/Fest, where it is nominated for the New Talent award. What We Left Unfinished traces the stories of five films, from thrillers and action movies to a romance, that were started but never completed during Afghanistan\u2019s communist era, when the film industry was state-sponsored. It is comprised of clips from the films (which include some great 1980s outfits and dance moves), along with interviews with the directors, casts and crews. These are people, says Ghani, \u201cwho sometimes went to crazy lengths to keep making films in a time when films were weapons and film-makers were targets\u201d. The communist era was a source of pain for Ghani\u2019s family. Ghani was born in New York in July 1978, shortly after a bloody coup led to the imprisonment and exile of most of her relatives. The regime lasted for almost a decade. The first president was ousted and killed in under a year, then the Soviet Union invaded, installed a new leader and lingered until 1989, battling the US-funded mujahideen all the while. The dramatic scenes from the five unfinished films \u2013 of desert battles, lawless heroin traders and a drunken soiree with shades of Abigail\u2019s Party \u2013 were never dignified with denouements, in much the same way as the short-lived reigns of the communist reformers. By 1996, when the Taliban took hold of Afghanistan, Ghani\u2019s father became convinced that \u201che could never go back\u201d. So the family grew reticent about sharing stories of their homeland. But when Ghani first visited, she felt a sense of recognition. \u201cI had been looking at my mother\u2019s photographs and Super 8 films for a lot of my life. I thought, \u2018It really is that beautiful.\u2019 But it is a beauty that breaks your heart.\u201d The communists invested heavily in film. As Faqir Nabi, one of the directors Ghani interviews, says: \u201cBelieve me, you can\u2019t do as much damage to your enemy with an F-16 or any other air power as you can with a really good film.\u201d The film-makers almost brag about their budgetary and military assistance, as if they couldn\u2019t believe their luck. But not all resources were forthcoming: for filming gun fights, blanks were rarely available, so they had to make do with live ammunition. Military characters were often played by real soldiers, who were incredible shots. This came in handy when anti-communist snipers decided to lurk near shooting locations. But there is one tragic anecdote of an actor getting his stage directions muddled and ducking at the wrong time. Apparently, he was shot in the head and killed instantly. \u201cWe had these risks on every film,\u201d says director Latif Ahmadi. \u201cWe had a passion, so we accepted them.\u201d Ghani describes What We Left Unfinished as \u201ca mostly true story\u201d. But she doesn\u2019t think anyone she interviewed told her the entire truth. \u201cIn fact, I think a number of people omitted a lot of things in their stories\u2026.\u201d There are a lot of ambiguities in the narratives and her documentary is cut to highlight the gaps \u201cbetween the stories and the history \u2013 what they\u2019re willing to say and not say about that time\u201d. The narration is \u201cvery unreliable \u2013 but deliberately so. It\u2019s telling you not to trust everything that\u2019s said.\u201d Because this is how all history is written? \u201cThat\u2019s what I strongly believe history is,\u201d she says. Many of the film-makers insist they were making art while acknowledging that their output also served as propaganda for the regime. The fact that the actors and the directors remember things differently is, says Ghani, \u201cbecause the actors were much more visible symbols of regime myth-making\u201d. Ahmadi claims that film crews could negotiate with mujahideen to be able to shoot on location, while actor Said Miran Farhad thought it was better to say he was a deserting regime soldier than an actor when stopped at a mujahideen checkpoint. And cast member Yasamin Yarmal says that if their crew had been captured not one man would have been left alive, while the women would have been kept as prisoners. Ghani found making the film a complicated process. But then behind each piece of her work lies a PhD\u2019s worth of digging. We\u2019re talking over tea at London\u2019s Wellcome Collection, for whom she has been working on a film about the metaphors we use to talk about illness (Dis-Ease will be screened there in the autumn). Ghani has recruited five researchers to collate audio, visual and textual material from multiple archives including New York Public Library, where she is artist-in-residence. \u201cWe have an entire database in which every image, text and video is tagged, annotated and cross-referenced \u2013 it\u2019s like a dream,\u201d she says. It\u2019s hard to fathom how Ghani can be creative with such an impenetrable mass of material, until she shows me an exquisite colour-coded story map she made, her method for organising \u201cnonlinear narratives\u201d. It\u2019s a work of art in itself. As What We Left Unfinished draws to a close, Said Miran Farhad tells us the mujahideen, Islamic State and the Taliban are \u201cthe enemies of film\u201d. The last word goes to Yarmal, who says that actresses are \u201cseen as non-believers, and an actress in the larger society\u2019s view is equivalent to a prostitute\u201d. She leaves us with a final plea: \u201cAll I want is for people to acknowledge and value the artists who work in cinema \u2013 or we\u2019ll be left with the same Taliban and Isis all over again.\u201d \u2022 What We Left Unfinished, directed by Mariam Ghani, is at Sheffield documentary festival on 8 and 10 June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
