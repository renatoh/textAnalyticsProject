Written in a code that has never been cracked, or a long-dead language, it contains crude drawings of nudes, plants and astrological diagrams. At least five centuries old, it first surfaced at the court of Rudolph II of Bohemia. Or perhaps it isn't and it didn't. The manuscript may just be a 20th-century hoax. This much-disputed text inspired Sebastian Baczkiewicz's play The Language of Angels (2.15pm, Radio 4). The setting is 1920s New York, where an antiquarian bookseller is set to foist a priceless - but bogus - volume on a billionaire collector. Unfortunately, the forger hired to create the work has gone Awol, convinced he is divinely inspired. M Emmet Walsh, Brendan Coyle and Nathan Osgood star. Otherwise, it's a day to contemplate life's greasy pole. Sports International (10.30am and repeated, World Service) looks at flash-in-the-pans like Jelena Dokic, the 21-year-old tennis player who already seems to have passed her peak. Material World (4.30pm, Radio 4) investigates why societies collapse, asking if today's skyscrapers might one day stand abandoned like the temples of Angkor Wat. And No Triumph, No Tragedy (9am, Radio 4) has Peter White interviewing blind singer Denise Leigh, whose success has shown up all the operatic societies that wouldn't let her audition. \"I'm a bit gobby,\" she says - a good thing in a diva."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
