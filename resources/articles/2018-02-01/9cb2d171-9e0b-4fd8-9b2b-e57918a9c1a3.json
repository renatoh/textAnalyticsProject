Described as being \u201cbuilt like a basketball player who struggles to keep his weight up\u201d, Lawes, who is 6ft 7in tall and listed as weighing 17st 7lb on the RFU website, has developed a penchant for club sandwiches at England\u2019s hotel \u2013 so much so that Jones can tell which bedroom he is in by the empty tray outside the door. Lawes\u2019s appetite is equally metaphorical. He has developed into arguably England\u2019s most consistent performer, whether it be in the second row or at blindside flanker, and he has done so despite an alarming amount of rugby in the past two seasons. Last term he was less than two matches shy of the arbitrary game limit (32 lots of 80 minutes), if British &amp; Irish Lions matches counted \u2013 for reasons unclear, they do not \u2013 and he is the tourist with the most domestic minutes played this season. \u201cI\u2019ve given everything I can for these last couple of years,\u201d he said. \u201cIt only makes me hungrier to go on and see how far I can push myself and how good a player I can become. \u201cI\u2019ve been fit and it\u2019s very hard to find a peak when you\u2019re not playing consistently. Eddie took charge and he challenged me to become a better player. I took on the challenge and I\u2019m on my way. \u201cI feel really good. I\u2019m ready to get into this tournament. The main thing is I\u2019ve been able to keep my strength up, I\u2019m making better decisions as a player on the field, using technique rather than trying to hit things, which helps a lot. Then it\u2019s just luck and hopefully that continues.\u201d To accuse Lawes of coasting when he first broke on to the international scene in 2009 would be harsh but competition for places in his position then pales in comparison to now and at 28, with four children after the arrival of twins in December, he is in the prime of his career and the peak of his powers. \u201cSometimes you need a bit of a kick up the bum to make you realise you\u2019re wasting your potential in certain ways,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t necessarily know what you\u2019ve got to put into it to get there.\u201d As England prepare to face Italy on Sunday, they appear light in the ball-carrying department without Billy Vunipola and Nathan Hughes but that, along with his footwork, have been two areas of marked improvement for Lawes. \u201cI am one of the main ball-carriers in the pack, certainly this time round,\u201d he said. \u201cI definitely see that as part of my influences on a game: ball-carrying, tackling, general collisions, impact work. \u201cI prefer playing at six because you get to make more tackles and spend more time in the looser play. That means you\u2019ll get a couple more carries in the game, which is a good thing for me. I\u2019ll play wherever I\u2019m picked, but I definitely prefer playing six.\u201d Lawes will be named in a strong-looking England starting XV on Friday, with Mike Brown expected to feature at full-back and Jack Nowell primed to be involved after recovering from an ankle injury. The loosehead Alec Hepburn is in line for an England debut at some stage but there may be a surprise at tighthead with Harry Williams pushing hard for a first Six Nations start and Jones mindful of Wales\u2019s visit to Twickenham six days after England face Italy. The latest indications are that Jonathan Joseph is set to edge out Ben Te\u2019o at outside-centre, with Danny Care pushing for the scrum-half spot and Sam Simmonds in line to start at No 8."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
