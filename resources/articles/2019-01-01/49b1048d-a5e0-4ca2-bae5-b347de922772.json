In a remark that angered Republicans while not being taken seriously by Democrats, Trump suggested legal status could be given to millions of undocumented people as part of a future grand bargain on American immigration law. The president floated the idea in a tweet on Sunday that stressed he was, for now, only offering to extend legal protections for some refugees and people who were brought to the US illegally as children. \u201cAmnesty will be used only on a much bigger deal, whether on immigration or something else,\u201d Trump said. He also said there would \u201cno big push\u201d to deport those already living in the US without permission. The US is more than four weeks into its longest government shutdown, which was triggered by Trump\u2019s refusal to sign a bipartisan congressional spending plan that did not give him the billions of dollars he wants for a wall along the border with Mexico. Trump\u2019s emphatic promise to \u201cbuild the wall\u201d won him the support of many conservative voters during the 2016 presidential campaign. He claimed he would force Mexico to pay for the wall directly, but has recently effectively conceded this will not happen. On Saturday, Trump said from the White House that he would agree to limited concessions for some undocumented immigrants if Democrats agreed to give him more than $5bn in public funds for the wall. Trump\u2019s offer would comprise a three-year extension in legal protection for roughly 700,000 \u201cdreamers\u201d, were brought to the US illegally as children, and approximately 300,000 refugees facing an end to temporary legal status. The proposal was dismissed by senior Democrats even before Trump began speaking. Democrats are demanding that Trump reopen the government by signing the existing congressional spending plan before any further negotiations on immigration. Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, described Trump\u2019s plan as a \u201ccompilation of several previously rejected initiatives\u201d that would not provide lasting security for dreamers and other groups. \u201cWhat is original in the president\u2019s proposal is not good,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is good in the proposal is not original.\u201d Republicans in the Senate will nonetheless take up Trump\u2019s proposals next week. The Oklahoma senator James Lankford told ABC\u2019s This Week the offer was \u201ca reasonable compromise\u201d and said: \u201cThe vote this week is not to pass the bill. It\u2019s to open up and say, \u2018Can we debate this? Can we amend it? Can we make changes?\u2019\u201d Democrats are unlikely to join in. On Saturday Chuck Schumer, the minority leader in the Senate, accused Trump of \u201cmore hostage taking\u201d as 800,000 federal government workers and hundreds of thousands of contractors continued to either work without pay or endure unpaid time off work. On Sunday, Schumer said he did not think the president\u2019s measures would pass the Senate. He also said he would push legislation to shield government workers from eviction or home foreclosure, repossession of cars and penalties for late payment of bills and student loans. Trump, meanwhile, insulted Pelosi and derided the cleanliness of the California city that she represents in Congress. He wrote in a tweet: \u201cAnd by the way, clean up the streets in San Francisco, they are disgusting!\u201d The president\u2019s proposal also met hostile reactions among many on the Republican right, highlighting a political dilemma that Trump, who claims to be a master dealmaker, has created for himself. Some conservatives dismissed the offer as being akin to an amnesty itself. Ann Coulter, the far-right author, said in a tweet: \u201cTrump proposes amnesty. We voted for Trump and got Jeb!\u201d The former Florida governor Jeb Bush, who was perceived as soft on immigration by the Republican right, was one of several candidates Trump defeated in the party\u2019s 2016 presidential primary contest. Mike Pence, Trump\u2019s vice-president, rejected the verdict of Coulter and other ultra-hardliners. \u201cIt\u2019s not amnesty,\u201d he told Fox News on Sunday. \u201cThere\u2019s no permanent status here at all, which is what amnesty contemplates.\u201d Trump has threatened to unilaterally declare an emergency to secure funding for the wall if the Democratic-controlled House refuses to approve his plans. Legal analysts have warned that such a drastic move would likely be halted by the courts. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, a Democrat, said on Sunday that the chaotic shutdown would only be repeated on future policy disputes if his party caved to Trump\u2019s demands on wall funding before a reopening of the government. \u201cIf the president can arbitrarily shut down the government now, he will do it time and again,\u201d Warner told NBC\u2019s Meet The Press. He and other Democrats have proposed passing separate legislation to ensure the out-of-pocket government workers are paid. Several opinion polls have indicated that a majority of Americans oppose Trump\u2019s plan to build a border wall and that more people blame Trump for the ongoing shutdown than blame Democrats in Congress. An average of polls compiled by RealClearPolitics currently states that 55.3% of Americans disapprove of Trump\u2019s performance, the highest figure since last March. A little over 41% of people approve."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
