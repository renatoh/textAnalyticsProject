Having secured a point when all looked lost with 25 minutes left, the home side could even have claimed all three had Ryan Nelsen's header not struck the upright in stoppage time, or Benni McCarthy not missed a penalty as the contest burst into life. Jussi Jaaskelainen redeemed himself with a fine save to deny McCarthy, having conceded the penalty in the first place by tripping substitute Roque Santa Cruz, an offence for which Allardyce believed the Bolton goalkeeper should have been dismissed. In the end Allardyce was left the happier manager, not least because he denied his former club what would and should have been a hugely significant victory. Yet he still felt somewhat aggrieved. \"Who would have thought that I'd be sat here disappointed with just a point?\" Allardyce asked. \"It didn't look like that at half-time. But we produced a tremendous fightback and recovery. Our character and commitment came through. \"Bolton sat back and tried to protect their lead but we created sustained pressure and when that happens teams can crack. I didn't understand why the penalty wasn't a red card. I thought it was the wrong decision. Mike Dean has not deemed it a goalscoring opportunity and I can't agree with that. Roque Santa Cruz went round him and would have knocked the ball into the net.\" Allardyce should also count his blessings considering the home side were outthought and outfought for an hour, and yet he still preserved his unbeaten record as Rovers manager. Matthew Taylor put Bolton ahead in the 15th minute by converting Ariza Makukula's cross before Kevin Davies doubled the advantage 10 minutes before the interval when beating Jaaskelainen at the second attempt. It was no more than Gary Megson's side deserved, yet Bolton of all teams should appreciate the battling qualities of sides prepared by Allardyce and the introduction of Tugay and Santa Cruz after an hour proved significant. Stephen Warnock pulled a goal back in the 66th minute and, even though McCarthy failed from the penalty spot, there was still time for him to make amends with four minutes left, when he bundled home from close range to profit from some stubborn play by Jason Roberts. Megson might feel this setback for some time and he said: \"We didn't play with the same momentum after the break and they were able to put on a \u00a320m striker. The lads are bitterly disappointed we haven't won it. When you are the team that is 2-0 down you tend to look at how the game finished and not how it started. We have come up against a club that is doing particularly well but we went about our business well in the first half. We just couldn't finish the job.\" Absent for Blackburn was Matt Derbyshire, who is understood to have agreed a six- month loan deal with Greek side Olympiakos. Pavel Pogrebnyak, the Zenit St Petersburg forward, could join Rovers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
