I click on a link in the email and input the reference number provided, and this takes me to a website which states, in large letters: \"Tenants Name: Mr John Frederick Smith*. Rent Default: \u00a32,390. Property Damages: \u00a37,000.\" To hammer home the message, there's a big picture of a red traffic light. It goes on to say that \"if a person with the same name as this\" approaches me about renting my property, I should enter their name and details into the website's search tool to see if it produces a match. Emails such as this are a daily occurrence if you join landlord networking site LandlordReferencing.co.uk. Also known as LRS, it markets itself as a community which aims to help landlords find out more about potential tenants' rental history and character. To date, it has about 20,000 members and aims to stop landlords experiencing their worst nightmare: getting saddled with a tenant with no intention of paying the rent or looking after your property. The site allows landlords to upload details of bad tenants who leave properties owing rent or causing damage, and warn other landlords. Its tagline is that LRS doesn't rely upon the information that a prospective tenant gives \u2013 it relies on the information they haven't handed over. The site's founder, Paul Routledge, is a landlord with 135 properties and plenty of stories to tell. He's quick to point out that LRS is not a \"tenant blacklist\" but a \"community\" where information is shared on both good and bad tenants. The good will find it easier to secure future properties, while the bad will find it nigh on impossible. \"We don't give away information,\" says Routledge. \"Landlords upload tenant information and, if another landlord searches for them and there's a match, we put the landlords in touch with one another.\" The problem with traditional credit checking services is that they only check an applicant's financial situation and employment, not their history of paying rent on time. Only disputes that have resulted in a county court judgment (CCJ) will show on a credit check, and a bad tenant is unlikely to hand over their last landlord's details for referencing. But isn't there a risk that disgruntled landlords might lie about tenants in revenge for minor misdemeanours? \"Why would they lie?\" asks Routledge. \"They don't lie because it's a criminal offence and because it's libellous. The site is data controlled and we vet the information we are given. The site is basically to make sure landlords turn down tenants who left their last property owing rent or having trashed the place. We don't just add tenants because they've been a pain, because they got orange paint on the carpet or owe \u00a330, for example. They have to be pretty bad.\" To date, Routledge says only one tenant has challenged information held about them by LRS, eventually conceding they did owe their previous landlord money because they left before the end of the tenancy. Rival referencing site TenantID.co.uk offers a similar service. It was set up by Lorna Stevens, but is now owned by credit reference agency Callcredit. The site stores tenants' letting history, allowing landlords, agencies and local authorities to see if their prospective tenant has a good or bad track record. Stevens says the site complies with the Data Protection Act and the Information Commissioner's Office because landlords need a tenant's permission before uploading their details \u2013 this can be obtained by adding a clause to the tenancy agreement at the outset. \"When landlords upload information they accept our terms and conditions, which say you can't upload false information. If they do, it's the landlord that would be breaking the law,\" she adds. Obviously it's not just tenants that behave badly \u2013 there are plenty of shoddy landlords and agents out there, with many guilty of providing sub-standard accommodation and breaking contract terms. To spread the word about them, there are several websites that allow tenants to do just that. However, many are amateurish or don't have much data. One site that is quite busy is allAgents.co.uk, where tenants and property owners can post reviews about lettings agents, estate agents and managing agents (for leasehold properties). The reviews can be quite damning. For example, \"JJ\" described a tale of broken appliances, a bathroom ceiling caving in, and a deposit withheld without reason after renting through one household name firm. Although agents have the right to reply on the site, Sarah Rushbrook of estate agent Rushbrook &amp; Rathbone says this doesn't help. \"Firstly, they do not have the time to respond to each and every review and secondly, they would have to be certain that what they were saying was absolutely factually correct, whereas a complainant can say exactly what he or she wants, true or false. There is also the fact that the perception of the agent would decline further if they were seen to be getting into a disagreement over the internet.\" Over on uklettingagent.co.uk, there are plenty of reviews, but in one long, seemingly random, list. Meanwhile, on loveyourlandlord.co.uk, reviews include property addresses and landlord names, but there's not much content. Consumer Focus, the statutory consumer champion, has announced it will trial a \"TripAdvisor\"-style website which will allow private tenants to share their experiences \u2013 good and bad \u2013 of letting agents and landlords. Claire McAnulty, policy expert at Consumer Focus, says: \"There is huge potential for a feedback website to give tenants a better idea of who they're renting from. Getting behind it could also help the industry establish a better reputation and build up much-needed trust with renters.\" The organisation says the site will be carefully monitored, with the organisers saying they are aware of the potential for libel, and for the posting of malicious comments by rivals, or perhaps by just one disenchanted tenant. Timothy Pinto from law firm Taylor Wessing is a media lawyer and expert on liability for user-generated content. He says renters posting false or libellous accusations on review sites could find themselves in trouble. \"If someone posts defamatory comments on a message board, they are primarily liable. To defend the claim, they would have to establish a defence such as truth, honest comment or privilege.\" However, the nature of review sites and discussion boards means posters are often anonymous. In this situation, a claimant may go after a website operator or internet service provider. However, if the site took down the offending post promptly when asked to, it is likely to have a defence. * As you might expect, we've changed the name Where to look"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
