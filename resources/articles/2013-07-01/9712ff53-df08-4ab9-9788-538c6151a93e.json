Taufel, speaking at an MCC spirit of cricket lecture at Lord's, discussed the benefits of the decision review system, which has been severely criticised during the current Ashes series following a number of controversial decisions. The Australian, who works as an umpire training manager for the International Cricket Council, said technology had created more \"armchair\" umpires and believes that, whatever system is in place, decisions will never be 100% perfect. \"Decision-making in today's game is in my opinion tougher than when I started umpiring 22 years ago because more people see evidence that we may not get to see on the ground at the time,\" said Taufel. \"Anyone who watches the game at the ground, on the giant replay screen or on TV, will assess each and every decision of the umpires and also make an overall judgment of their performance. \"The decision of the umpire is scrutinised by all these cameras including slow motion, ultra-motion, Hot Spot front on, Hot Spot leg-side, Hot Spot off-side, ball tracking and prediction, Snicko, stump audio, the mat. There is no doubt we now have a lot more 'armchair' experts; everyone umpires the game by watching television. \"The invasive nature of this broadcasting has a double edge to it \u2013 it does put more pressure on players and umpires. Not too much now happens on a cricket field that is not captured by a camera, a microphone or piece of technology. This has the ability to bring out the best in the game and also the worst.\" DRS has been the subject of intense debate during the Ashes series, which England lead 2-0. A number of controversial decisions have been made by the third umpires in both Tests, at Trent Bridge and Lord's,. Only four umpires are permitted to preside over the back-to-back series \u2013 Aleem Dar, Kumar Dharmasena, Tony Hill and Marais Erasmus \u2013 as they are the only \"elite\" officials who are from neither Australia nor England. Taufel believes it is crucial for the integrity of the game that umpires remain from neutral countries but said the authorities had to be \"pragmatic\" in their use of technology. \"The technology genie has been let out of the bottle and it's not going to go back in. I would simply advocate that we look at ways to be as pragmatic as possible so we can get more correct decisions and deliver more justice. \"We should be asking: 'Are we using technology in the best way to serve the players, supporters, umpires and values of our game?' No matter what system of technology review we implement in our game, it will not be perfect or 100%.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
