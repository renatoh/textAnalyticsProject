The ground is sodden. Storms and worse have swept the corn belt this spring. Memorial Day, the official start of summer, was marked by tornadoes and hail. Angie Williams and her father Bruce have just started planting on their 1,000-acre farm in Avon, Indiana. \u201cMy dad is 64 and he has never seen a situation like this. We have neighbors in their 80s who have never seen anything like this,\u201d she said. It\u2019s 4 June. Usually they would be done by 10 May. \u201cWe\u2019ll be operating at a loss this year,\u201d she said. And it\u2019s not just the dire and turbulent weather that Indiana\u2019s $25bn agriculture sector has to contend with. Farmers are caught up in a political storm too. Already exports of soybeans to China have all but dried up thanks to the Trump administration\u2019s ongoing trade dispute with Beijing. Now Donald Trump is also threatening to escalate its trade war with Mexico, a major buyer of Indiana corn. Trump has threatened to impose a 5% levy on Mexican imports starting next week and has said the fees could rise to 25% unless Mexico does more to stem the flow of migrants trying to cross into the US. Mexican officials are in Washington trying to head off the tariffs. \u201cI understand what the president is trying to do,\u201d said Williams. \u201cI support him, I just wish it didn\u2019t affect us so personally.\u201d Trump\u2019s Mexican standoff has Republicans worried too. Republican senators who have shown little appetite for taking on Trump have come out firmly against the proposal. \u201cI will yield to nobody in passion and seriousness and commitment for securing the border,\u201d Senator Ted Cruz told reporters this week. \u201cBut there\u2019s no reason for Texas farmers and ranchers and manufacturers and small businesses to pay the price of massive new taxes.\u201d Trump for his part has said his party would be \u201cfoolish\u201d to try to stop him. All this uncertainty has farmers rattled, said Bob Nielsen, professor of agronomy at Purdue University, as they contend with a \u2013 potentially \u2013 disastrous planting season. \u201cThis is the slowest planting season I have seen in 37 years,\u201d he said. By now farmers have usually planted 90% of their crop but the average across the state is around 31%, he says. With better weather and a late harvest farmers could still recover from this late start but if Trump follows through with tariffs on corn \u201cthat would have a very big impact\u201d, he predicted. It\u2019s not just Indiana\u2019s farmers who are worried. The state helped put Trump in the White House in 2016 and has seen its unemployment rate drop to just 3.6% since his election. But the trade disputes are worrying manufacturers, said Andrew Berger, senior vice-president of governmental affairs at the Indiana Manufacturers Association. \u201cThe biggest fear is that the replacement for Nafta [the North American Free Trade Agreement] will be disrupted,\u201d he said. The US, Canada and Mexico are currently trying to ratify Nafta\u2019s replacement, the United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA). Trump\u2019s new tariff threat is heightening concern that the deal will collapse, adding yet more uncertainty for businesses in the region. Mexico was Indiana\u2019s second largest export market in 2018 behind Canada and is far more important to the state than China. On top of that Indiana imported $4.5bn worth of goods from Mexico in 2018. A 5% tariff would add $226m to those imports, 25% would add $1.1bn. Indiana\u2019s economy may be \u201chumming\u201d, said Berger, but Mexican tariffs \u201cwould hit us immediately\u201d. \u201cPerhaps the worst part of the problem is it doesn\u2019t even have anything to do with trade \u2013 it\u2019s about immigration. That\u2019s not an easily solvable issue,\u201d he added. Manufacturers are hoping this is a bluff. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of skepticism about the seriousness of this, frankly,\u201d Berger said. \u201cThere is a feeling that this is just a tactic to get [Mexico\u2019s] attention.\u201d But \u2013 like the Indiana weather \u2013 it\u2019s almost impossible to predict what will happen next. \u201cWe just feel like we are caught in the crossfire,\u201d said Williams as she headed out to her fields for another 18-hour day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
