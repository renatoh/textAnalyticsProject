Thierry Henry has been Arsenal's hero so often in the Champions League at Highbury this season that it seems his goals alone have carried the club into the second round. Last night, when it mattered most, the French striker remained calm. A cool finish in the third and final minute of stoppage time confirmed Arsenal's place in the last 16 and prevented them having to travel to Schalke next week in search of a point. Gelsenkirchen may not be a popular holiday destination but Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's team can go there and relax. Wenger confirmed Henry will be among those rested and the 24-year-old deserves a breather. His goals against Panathinaikos last week saw off the Greek side and he got two more in the 3-2 defeat of Schalke. His record for Arsenal in Europe stands at 17 goals in 31 matches. Not long ago Highbury might have feared the worst when Henry raced clear from a quick Giovanni van Bronckhorst free-kick. These days it is different. \"That's where the strength of Thierry lies at the moment,\" Wenger noted. \"He doesn't miss these chances like a year ago. That shows how much he has improved.\" Until Henry struck in dramatic fashion it seemed the latest in a sequence of defensive lapses would cost Arsenal, who knew a two-goal win would suffice as long as Schalke did not win at Panathinaikos. The Greeks played their part with a 2-0 victory to go through too. Wenger's players, struggling to find their rhythm, had finally overcome an hour of frustration against a negative Real Mallorca by establishing a 2-0 lead thanks to strikes in quick succession from Robert Pires and Dennis Bergkamp when they let the Spanish side back into the match. Few can have been surprised when Alvaro Novo scored in the 74th minute, given that it is eight Champions League games since Arsenal kept a clean sheet. That is a worrying statistic. Somehow Nwankwo Kanu wasted an 89th-minute chance to play hero but Henry, despite a groin strain, was not to be denied. Arsenal were only intermittently fluent against a Mallorca side more interested in destroying than creating until they fell behind. The visitors arrived with a 4-5-1 formation and their constant harrying made life hard. If Arsenal's play was patchy their desire was plain. Henry and Patrick Vieira, in particular, did their utmost to drive the team forward. \"I was pleased with the performance and the resilience,\" Wenger said. We look much more comfortable when he have to chase a game and score goals than we do keeping a result at the moment. Looking where we started, with two defeats away, to turn it around like we did was a great performance.\" This did not start as a great display. Possession was wasted and Arsenal laboured without creating until late in the first half. Then Henry twice had chances and Dennis Bergkamp had a penalty turned down before chipping just wide. Almost nothing had been seen of Mallorca as an attacking force but, when Alejandro Campano wasted a fine chance after the interval, it seemed Arsenal could be in trouble. Then, suddenly, Pires knocked in Freddie Ljungberg's cross and Bergkamp headed in a Van Bronckhorst centre and Arsenal seemed set fair. Novo's goal from a Campano pass changed the mood and there were nervous moments for Arsenal and a Pires goal ruled out for offside before Van Bronckhorst sent Henry clear from near the edge of his own area. After Sir Alex Ferguson's claim that Ruud van Nistelrooy is the finest striker in Europe, Wenger put the case for his man. \"Thierry is top, top class,\" he said. \"I'm a great believer in him. I brought him here and put him in this position. He's not only a great football player but a great athlete.\" No one at Highbury will argue. \u00b7 The Group C leaders Panathinaikos beat Schalke 2-0 in Athens thanks to goals from Emmanuel Olisadebe and Michalis Konstantinou.
