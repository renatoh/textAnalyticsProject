It\u2019s not the first time that fisherman fashion has been co-opted by those who don\u2019t necessarily spend their leisure time with rods, reels and sinkers. But forget the Aran jumpers, thick-knit scarfs and rolled-up beanies that hit the catwalk \u2013 and subsequently the high street \u2013 circa 2016. This time around it is the utilitarian, functional fashion favoured by those fishing rivers and lakes that have become an unlikely style muse. On the catwalk this spring and summer, pocket-heavy fishing gilets came in botanical prints at Anna Sui, as well as more traditional khaki at Sacai \u2013 signalling that, unlike deep-sea fishing trends past, the angler look is not weighted towards menswear. Men do have their chance to pick up on the trend though \u2013 pocketed gilets also featured heavily at the Louis Vuitton menswear show. On the high street, fisherman gilets have since cropped up at brands including Topshop and Urban Outfitters. It is unlikely that comedians Bob Mortimer and Paul Whitehouse thought of themselves as trendsetters when they set out to make the BBC series Gone Fishing. But they were ahead of the game. Fisherman\u2019s hats are very much on trend, having been spearheaded by the likes of Rihanna, Kaia Gerber and Bella Hadid, as well as featuring in shows from Craig Green to Burberry, and more recently MSGM. Asos saw sales rise by 343% in a year while Weekday currently offers 10 different styles of fisherman\u2019s hat, all in heavy-duty, technical materials. Footwear, too, has taken a decidedly fishy turn, especially at the autumn/winter shows, suggesting this isn\u2019t merely a fair-weather trend. Thigh-high welly-style waders featured on the catwalk at Jacquemus and Toga, while the latter also showcased shoes resembling galoshes, paired with hooded anoraks. Elsewhere, the Christmas Island bootie sold by fly-fishing and game-shooting brand Orvis bares a keen resemblance to Balenciaga\u2019s stretch-knit high-top trainers. Gemma Hayward, senior fashion editor at large for Grazia magazine (and member of her local angling society) cites practicality as part of the trend\u2019s appeal. \u201cFashion\u2019s current obsession with utility dressing is crossing catwalks and the gender divide,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s only natural that something as useful as the multi-pocket waistcoat has been given a high-fashion spin \u2013 just replace hooks and bait for purses and phones.\u201d Despite this rise to high fashion, recreational fishing does not enjoy the wellness associations of the sporting attire worn to boutique gym classes and yoga retreats. But could it? \u201cSitting by a beautiful lake, focusing on your float is a surprisingly peaceful way to while away a few hours,\u201d says Hayward, making the case for fishing as a sport that may, in fact, tap into on-trend ideas about mindfulness and meditation \u2013 not to mention its Instagram-ability. \u201cPeople who fish always say it focuses the mind and has a tranquility to it,\u201d says fashion historian Tony Glenville. \u201cWhat could be a better escape from Brexit? It also makes me think of all those Britpop boys who moved to the country.\u201d It\u2019s true that the concept of having \u201cgone fishing\u201d is not a million miles from the more modern desire to go \u201coff-grid\u201d. \u201cI think it\u2019s great to see that our little passion can inspire some items on the catwalk,\u201d says Jo Stephenson, an Angling Trust ambassador. Waders or a sunshirt are often angling essentials, she says, although her own must-have item is a bumbag, the 90s accessory which has experienced a fashion revival over recent summers. Not, then, the fully functioning fishing set \u2013 comprising rod, flies and a wicker \u201ccreel\u201d bag, and costing \u00a317,000 \u2013 currently offered by French fashion house Herm\u00e8s. While fishing brands are striving to make the clothes worn by keen fishers more attractive, part of the appeal to those outside this community will doubtless lie in the fact that such garments reject conventional ideas of fashion and style. It\u2019s about a desire for clothes \u201cwith integrity, real clothes and not \u2018fashion\u2019 \u2013 even though it is\u201d, says Glenville."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
