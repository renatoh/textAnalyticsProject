Obama's victory in the Democratic primary was powered by women voters, whom he won by 54% according to exit polls, and by black voters, by 80% compared with Clinton's 18%. Clinton won the white vote - by 70% to Obama's 26% - but not by a wide enough margin to overcome Obama's advantages lesewhere. With 98% of the votes counted, Obama had 57%, followed by Clinton with 36%, a healthy 20 percentage point margin. (A rough calculation suggests around 33 delegates for Obama, compared with 23 for Clinton, and so a margin of perhaps 10 delegates for Obama on the night.) Elsewhere, Obama also racked up a huge win in the US Virgin Islands, taking nearly 90% of the votes and so winning all three of the pledged delegates available. (You know it's a tight race when everyone reports the Virgin Islands results.)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
