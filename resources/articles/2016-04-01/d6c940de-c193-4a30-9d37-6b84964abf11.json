You might not have noticed because it hasn\u2019t been via the usual route of airstrikes, democracy and IMF-administered debt slavery, but rather using soft power projected from an increasing multitude of digital devices. If it\u2019s not your phone, it\u2019s your smart watch buzzing to let you know it\u2019s time to open another chest in Clash Royale, harvest crops in Township or submit yourself once again to the all-consuming maw of Candy Crush Saga, and that\u2019s before you\u2019ve started fiddling about with virtual reality visors. You may never be more than six feet away from a rat, but you\u2019re never more than the thickness of your trouser pocket away from a game. After a rough few years of seeing players slip off to buy competitors\u2019 consoles, Nintendo would dearly like a bit of that intimacy for itself and has made the painful decision to expand into developing games not just for its own consoles but other people\u2019s mobile platforms, too. The friendly Japanese megacorp\u2019s first foray into app development arrived this month with Miitomo. Cooking up a comedy cartoon simulacrum that acts as your online avatar, you are asked your opinions and encouraged to share them with your friends, harvesting their answers in return. The sorts of thing you\u2019ll be discovering are all in the \u201cwhat\u2019s your favourite food?\u201d grade of questioning, and it\u2019s generally so afraid of offending anyone that its banality becomes an affront. The Mii characters are pretty funny, though, and will be familiar to anyone who owned a Wii, which unlike its big brother sold spectacularly well. It also benefits from Nintendo\u2019s signature gentle playfulness and levels of technical polish, but it\u2019s all so milquetoast. Added to the slightly cloying free-to-play mechanics that try to encourage you to spend real money, it\u2019s as if Mario retired from plumbing and started selling timeshares. You\u2019ve got to hope Nintendo has a couple more tricks up its sleeve to sustain interest until the launch of its new NX console, rumoured to be at the end of the year. Overwatch Conquering all does come with its downsides, and as playing gets more mainstream it inevitably draws levels of idiocy that are normally only inflicted on anyone who\u2019s accidentally read a YouTube comment. Upcoming third person shooter-meets-MMO Overwatch is from the people who made World Of Warcraft, and therefore a) has a marketing budget big enough to make it totally unavoidable, and b) is laden with the sort of overbearingly heavy-handed fan expectation normally reserved for Star Wars films and football managers. So, in a game due out at the end of May that few people have actually played, there is already an online furore. It\u2019s been created by a preview video in which the victory pose of one of its characters, Tracer, is revealed. The pose shows her turning away from the camera in a coy, bum-emphasising gesture that some fans felt was too suggestive. When developer Blizzard hastily removed the clip, an equally vociferous campaign erupted to demand it reinstate the pose, citing all sorts of unswervingly dull ephemera (There are bums in other games! She\u2019s wearing clothes! Freedom of speech!), the likes of which you\u2019d scarcely think would be worth people\u2019s time and energy. Although lacking the brain-melting ridiculousness of Gamergate, the result is still an impasse as loud as it is stupid and a storm of publicity that\u2019s exactly the sort of thing enormous marketing budgets are supposed to generate. Somewhere, men in suits are cautiously upping sales forecasts in multi-page spreadsheets, and when they think nobody\u2019s looking, quietly rubbing their hands together. Now Play This The London games festival, which ended last week, again featured Now Play This, a three-day extravaganza of \u201coutsider\u201d games created by architects, poets and theatre folk. Massive Battleships was a team-based version of the hoary old game of near-chance, that needed \u201cflags, binoculars, cunning and teamwork\u201d to win. Snakebite was a room-scale multiplayer reimagining of Snake, the game Nokia made ubiquitous by including it on all its indestructible early mobile phones. Snakes were projected on to the floor and steered by stamping on pedals rather than poking numbers on a telephone keypad the size of half a brick. None of this is likely to spark any fresh consumer crazes, but it\u2019s fascinating what you can create with imagination, a little technology and a group of likeminded people. While some snakes filled rooms, others had more modest dimensions. Also shown at the event was Cobra Club, a game of simulated phallic photography in which your protagonist stands naked in front of a bathroom mirror, digitally recreated mobile in one hand and, ahem, cobra in the other. Its wry underlying commentary on mass surveillance was expressed via various circumferences of dick pic. Intrepid PC-owners can try it out in the privacy of their own homes completely free."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
