Having spent a year studying an MSc in applied marine science at Plymouth University's Institute of Marine Studies, he now works for the Environment Agency in Exeter, and one of his jobs is to ensure that water companies keep bathing waters up to standard. \"We at the Environment Agency come at water quality from an ecology point of view and the water companies approach the issue from a business point of view so we spend a lot of time negotiating with them,\" he says. Guy, who lives and works in Exeter, signed up for the marine science course after deciding he wanted a change of career and a job which allowed him to live closer to the waves. He is now involved with the tidal waters group at the Environment Agency and regularly liaises with water companies over their water treatment schemes. \"I was keen to do the course because I grew up by the sea and I always liked rummaging around in rockpools as a kid. Part of my MSc was in physical oceanography - for example what happens in estuaries when sea and salt water mix; the effects of tides and the human impact on the coast. The course also looked at marine pollution, coastal defences, and the ecology of the oceans.\" The course involved boat trips to measure ocean salinity and temperature in the Tamar estuary aboard the university's 30ft catamaran. Oceanography is the study of the physical and chemical processes of the oceans. Scientists measure temperature, salinity, currents, and geology. Departments tend to have people from a range of different backgrounds working together to understand what drives these huge bodies of water. Dr Jonathan Sharples, course director of the MSc in Oceanography at Southampton University, says: \"It's a truly interdisciplinary science. Physicists look at the effects of tides and turbulence and model ocean currents. They examine the relationship between the ocean and the atmosphere and how the balance between the two is likely to change in the future. \"The chemists study the effects of increased nutrient loads in coastal waters because of nitrogen and phosphate run-offs from farming and industry. We are also starting to measure the impact of nitrogen from car exhaust fumes and how the high levels in the atmosphere are changing the chemical composition of the sea.\" Students can also look at the deeper ocean chemistry and how hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor have an impact on the way the waters behave. There is a range of careers available to postgraduate students who successfully complete the course. Some, like Guy Baker, go on to work for organisations which try to control and monitor the health of the seas around Britain. Others work for charities like Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace. Major oil companies are also looking for specialists who can carry out assessments of the environmental impact of drilling new sites and model the path of potential oil spills and find ways to limit the ecological damage. There are also openings for oceanographic consultants and instrument manufacturers, particularly in the south of England. Bleddyn Lake now works for the Friends of the Earth in Cardiff after studying oceanography and marine biology at the University of Wales, Bangor. Bleddyn loved the opportunity the course gave him to escape from the lecture theatre to gain hands-on experience at the coast and on boats. \"It really broadened my horizons and took me out of the classroom into the real world,\" he says. \"We studied rock formations and tidal flows in the Menai Straits at Anglesey, where tidal movements are the second highest in the world and currents are particularly fierce. I found the course extremely helpful in making me more aware of the environmental damage we are doing to the sea through chemical pollution.\" The majority of students on postgraduate courses tend to be those with a first degree in maths, physics, chemistry, biology or environmental sciences. In recent years there has been a growth in oceanographic exploration, often driven by the requirements of the World Climate Research Programme. This is because climate changes are often linked to changes in the ocean, and oceanographers can expect to travel widely. Scientists at Southampton, for example, have links with the World Climate Research Programme and also with the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change, which is trying to predict and control the effects of global warming. At Southampton Oceanography Centre there are around 100 applications for 50 places for the one-year MSc in oceanography which has been running since 1965. There are six Research Council studentships, and fees for UK students are \u00a32,875 while overseas students have to pay \u00a39,500 in course fees. Bleddyn Lake was always aware of man's impact on the oceans and our coasts, but he says the course deepened that knowledge. \"It really opened my eyes to the influence we have on the seas,\" he says. \"I now have an in-depth knowledge of environmental issues and hazards and that has been extremely useful in my job at Friends of the Earth.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
