The 40-year-old woman was carried from the scene in Bad Reichenhall, Bavaria, this morning, three days after the roof collapsed on skaters. She is thought to be the final victim left among the wreckage. Hundreds of exhausted rescue workers and trained dogs began winding down a dangerous and frustrating search. All 15 of the victims died instantly and could not have been saved by rescuers, said Edith Tutsch-Bauer, the head of the nearby Salzburg medical examiner's office, which conducted the autopsies. There has been speculation that the flat roof of the 1970s building could not support the weight of snow that had fallen in recent weeks. The roof collapsed suddenly on Monday afternoon, crushing and burying skaters beneath splintered beams and twisted metal as well as the snow that had accumulated on top of its flat surface. With the scale of the tragedy finally clear, the town's mayor, Wolfgang Heitmeier, said residents were in the grip of \"mourning and deep sadness\". He said there was also \"anger and hate\" - much of it directed at him and fellow local leaders - over widely held suspicions that the safety of the ice rink had been neglected. Officials laid out a book of condolences in the town hall for residents and visitors and there were fresh flowers and candles in the snow around the fountain outside. More than 5,200 people have signed an electronic condolence book on the internet. Prosecutors have opened an investigation into possible negligent homicide, but Mr Heitmeier insisted authorities had no reason to doubt the safety of the rink. Yesterday, he denied the roof was in urgent need of repair. Many residents have said the fact that the arena's roof had leaked for years was warning enough that it was deteriorating, and that officials should have found the funds to fix it rather than spending on new thermal baths and a pedestrian shopping street. \"The feeling is that it should not have happened,\" said shopkeeper Renate Wagner, 59. \"Some of the money they spent could have put into the rink, which was one of the few places for the kids to go and enjoy themselves,\" she said, blinking back tears in behind her counter.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
