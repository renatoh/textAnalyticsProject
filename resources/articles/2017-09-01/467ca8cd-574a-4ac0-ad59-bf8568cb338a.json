Police were called to Stratford at about 6:15pm on Friday after a fight broke out near Stratford tube station. A man with stab wounds was taken to hospital by London ambulance service. His condition was not known as of Friday night. A second man was found with head injuries, although his condition is not believed to be serious. One witness said there was \u201cblood all over the floor,\u201d while a photograph taken in the shopping centre shows police attending to a person lying on the floor. The Metropolitan police said a man had been arrested on suspicion of assault causing grievous bodily harm and possession of an offensive weapon. An investigation is ongoing but a spokesman for Scotland Yard said reports of armed police being called were not accurate. Commuter Hollie Rose said on Twitter: \u201cImagine getting locked in a store in Westfield only to come out to find blood all over the floor and police everywhere, brilliant.\u201d Another bystander posted:"}, "isHosted": false}}}
