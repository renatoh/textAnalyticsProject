The truth was far darker", "bodyText": "On 8 July, Police Scotland issued a statement: \u201cPolice are appealing for the assistance of the public in tracing relatives of 53-year-old Mark David James Starr, who was found dead within the Glasgow Green area of Glasgow on 28 June 2019.\u201d Starr was homeless and had been sleeping rough in Glasgow\u2019s oldest city park. Police said there were no suspicious circumstances, although the cause of death has not yet been determined. Three weeks later, another appeal was issued. \u201cOfficers believe Mr Starr may have relatives in the Kent area, but have been unable to track down any family members despite a previous appeal on 8 July.\u201d It seemed like one of those horribly familiar stories \u2013 homeless man dies alone, with no one to miss or mourn him. \u201cWe didn\u2019t find out till five weeks after Mark died. And then it was on social media,\u201d says Mark\u2019s mother, Sue. She looks at her daughter, Karen. \u201cOne of your friends saw it on Facebook didn\u2019t she, and texted you.\u201d \u201cYeah, she said: \u2018This isn\u2019t your Mark, is it?\u2019\u201d Karen says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d \u201cI still can\u2019t believe it,\u201d Sue says. \u201cWell, you don\u2019t ever imagine one of your children is going to end up in that situation, do you? He always told me he was doing fine in Glasgow.\u201d Silence. \u2018My homeless brother died on the streets of Glasgow. Who will be next?\u2019 \u2013 video They sound numb. Both are still in shock. It\u2019s September, barely a month since they heard the news, and only a week since Mark Starr\u2019s funeral in his home town, Ashford, Kent. Sue and Karen tell us about the service. Four old friends carried the coffin, and they played some of Mark\u2019s favourite songs: Bitter Sweet Symphony, Like a Rolling Stone, He Ain\u2019t Heavy, He\u2019s My Brother \u2013 all of them painfully apt. We meet at a cafe in Ashford town centre. Karen is shy and withdrawn; Sue is open and talkative, and even in her grief she wheezes with laughter at some of the things Humpy got up to. Humpy is Mark. That\u2019s the nickname his older brother, Tony, gave him when he was a little boy because he always got the hump. Somebody would take his ball or he would go fishing and catch nothing, and Mark would strop off for a couple of hours. But he always came back. He loved his nickname, and had it tattooed on his arm. It was his only tattoo. Mark was born two months premature, weighing just three and a half pounds. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think he\u2019d survive,\u201d Sue says. \u201cI was going to call him Jason. I just liked the name. But the priest came to see me and said: \u2018I think we better get the baby christened straight away,\u2019 and I couldn\u2019t think straight. He suggested Mark, \u2019cos he was a saint.\u201d After a month, Mark began to thrive and Sue was allowed to leave hospital. The Starrs were a close family, but nobody was closer to Mark than Tony. He isn\u2019t here today because he has taken his brother\u2019s death so badly. \u201cWe used to get the school bus together and the driver called us the Three Musketeers because we always looked out for each other,\u201d Karen says. Sue and Karen have brought photos with them. There are pictures of Mark eating a toffee apple in Hastings, holding a tiny monkey, camping with friends in Wales. \u201cI don\u2019t think they washed all week!\u201d Sue says. Her laughter sets off her hacking smoker\u2019s cough. Like all the family, Sue sounds cockney even though she was born and bred in Kent. She tells us about the rosettes Mark won for showjumping. \u201cThere was a time we thought he would be a jockey. He was really good.\u201d But as with so much, he lost interest. Mark Starr on a family holiday There are so many stories about Mark \u2013 most of them involving the outdoors, and things going hopelessly wrong. There was the time he went camping and the tent blew away in the middle of the night because they hadn\u2019t secured it properly; the school trip when he got lost; the visit to Luton to watch George Best when he and Tony got on the corrugated iron roof and fell through it. He was a happy, fearless boy, they say. Mark left school at 15 without qualifications. \u201cHe was never going to be a scholar,\u201d Sue says. \u201cHis reports always said: \u2018Could do well, but lacks concentration.\u2019\u201d He got a job assisting a gamekeeper. The problem was he didn\u2019t bother turning up to work. \u201cHe did come clean in the end,\u201d Sue says. \u201cHe was just hanging out with his mates. You always thought he was listening to you, but he wasn\u2019t really.\u201d Nothing appeared to worry him, she says. And that\u2019s what stopped her worrying about him \u2013 for a while. * * * A few weeks later we meet Tony Starr with Sue in Ashford. With red hair stretching down his back and a lived-in face, Tony looks like an ageing rock star. His early memories of Mark are idyllic \u2013 fishing with their father every Sunday, floating down the river on homemade rafts, crabbing on the beach, listening to nightingales in the woods, hanging off cliffs to collect birds\u2019 eggs. \u201cNot a care in the world, mate,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019d take a few jam sandwiches; when we were thirsty we drank river water! Humpy was a good fisher. You made your own entertainment in them days. We weren\u2019t stuck in front of a screen eight hours a day.\u201d But the more he talks about his brother, the more complex the character that emerges. As a young boy, Mark had terrible nightmares. \u201cHe\u2019d wake up in the night, proper screaming. We never understood why. I\u2019d just pick a slipper up and throw it at him. \u2018Shut up Humpy.\u2019 One night we were hanging out in the back garden, in a tent, camping out, and Humpy was screaming in his sleep. The neighbour jumped over the fence. He thought we were being attacked. Humpy always sucked his thumb. Even into his late 30s, he sucked his thumb.\u201d Tony Starr, who retraced his brother\u2019s footsteps from Kent to Glasgow. Photogrpah: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian Rather than being carefree, it sounds more like Mark simply didn\u2019t care, so he would steal packets of Chewits as a kid and not worry about being chased by the shop owner, and years later would drive without having passed his test. Sue talks about the time his grandmother needed a lift and Mark called for her in a little white van. When Mark\u2019s grandmother complained that it was cold and asked him if the windows were open, he replied there were no windows. \u201cI said to Mark: \u2018You\u2019ve not got a licence, you can\u2019t keep doing this.\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t need a licence,\u2019 he said.\u201d That was always his attitude \u2013 he didn\u2019t need the paperwork, didn\u2019t need to follow rules, didn\u2019t need money or a job \u2013 he would get by. And, for a time, he did. His family still say he never seemed unhappy. He had plenty of friends, and was popular with women. In his early 20s, he moved in with his girlfriend, Rebecca. \u201cShe was stunning,\u201d Tony says. \u201cHonest to God, she\u2019d make Page 3 girls look ordinary. I thought: you\u2019re punching above your weight there, Hump. But Rebecca only had eyes for him. They\u2019d been friends as kids \u2013 she was a bit of a wild child.\u201d Tony says Mark and Rebecca started to take cannabis, and progressed from there. Before long they were injecting heroin. Then one day Mark woke up, and Rebecca was dead in bed next to him. She was 24. \u201cHe never recovered from that,\u201d Tony says. \u201cA part of him never came back.\u201d Mark, aged about 9, is centre, holding a monkey with his sister Karen (left), brother Tony (back right) and friends on holiday in Hastings Even then his parents didn\u2019t know he was addicted to heroin. Mark returned to the family home, and one day his father found a syringe in his bedroom. Mark told his father, a concrete finisher on building sites, that it wasn\u2019t his syringe. \u201cAnd his dad said: \u2018Well, it\u2019s not mine or Mum\u2019s or Tony\u2019s or Karen\u2019s. Don\u2019t treat me like a fool, it\u2019s got to be yours,\u2019\u201d Sue says. Tony remembers how distraught their father was that day. \u201cWe had a few chickens back then. I went down to see my dad and he was in tears, looking at the chickens. Blank face. I\u2019d never seen my dad like that. He was just so sad about it.\u201d After Rebecca\u2019s death, Mark lost three more people he loved: his aunt Elsie, who used to take the Starr children on holiday every summer and was known in the family for making the best chips in Kent; his best friend, Martin (another drug addict); and his father, who died suddenly 20 years ago, when he was still working on building sites. \u201cHumpy took it bad. Dad adored all of us, but Humpy was his favourite. And Humpy loved Dad.\u201d As time went on, Mark became less and less functional. He served a few short prison sentences for shoplifting and then three years of a five-year term for attempting to import 60g of heroin in his pants. Even when he was in jail he told his family that he was doing just fine. Sue reads a letter Mark sent from Elmley prison on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, soon after arriving there. \u201cThe food\u2019s OK. Send my love to everyone. Tell Aunt Elsie I\u2019m OK and not to worry \u2026 see you both in a couple of months. Lots of love, Mark.\u201d He came out of prison, tried to beat his addiction and failed. But still his family insist he didn\u2019t seem to have a care in the world. He had a council flat in Ashford and would pop round every day to Karen\u2019s for a cooked breakfast. Tony says he never forgot a birthday, would always trim his grandmother\u2019s hedge, and that he was a wonderful uncle to Tony\u2019s son, Jude. \u201cHumpy thought the world of my boy. He\u2019d come round for Sunday dinner and straight afterwards he\u2019d say: \u2018Come on, Jude, let\u2019s go out and have a game of football.\u2019 When Eminem came over he got a photo signed by him. God knows where he got it from.\u201d Despite the acts of generosity, Mark\u2019s life became more and more chaotic. He would disappear for long periods of time without telling the family. Tony went round to his flat one day and was shocked to see drug paraphernalia everywhere. \u201cIt was like needle city. I went mad. I said: \u2018You silly bugger. Leave that stuff alone, it\u2019s a one-way ticket to misery.\u2019 But it was like talking to a brick wall. I said: \u2018Humpy mate, they are going to get rid of you\u2019, and they did. They evicted him.\u201d It was about eight years ago that Mark was evicted from his flat in Ashford. There were times he stayed with Tony and Sue, and times he lived on the streets. Tony says some local people treated Mark with contempt. \u201cKids used to throw water over him. He got no help in Ashford. He was frowned upon.\u201d He would stay with Tony, but after a few days he would find it claustrophobic. \u201cThen he\u2019d just go. He couldn\u2019t stay in one place.\u201d Over the years Mark became delusional. Neither Tony nor Sue believe he got the support he needed. \u201cThere ain\u2019t no mental health these days,\u201d Tony says. \u201cIt\u2019s all shot to pieces.\u201d Four years ago, Mark upped and left Ashford. Again, he didn\u2019t give his family warning. \u201cEventually he phoned me up and I said: \u2018Where are you, Mark?\u2019 And he said: \u2018I\u2019m in Scotland,\u2019\u201d Sue recalls. \u201cI said: \u2018What are you doing up there?\u2019 He said: \u2018It\u2019s lovely here, and the people here are lovely.\u2019 He said he was staying in a hostel. I was looking after my mum who had dementia and couldn\u2019t be left, and he phoned up and said: \u2018You and nan will have to come up for a holiday when I\u2019ve got my own place. It\u2019s really good up here. I\u2019m happy.\u2019 I said: \u2018Thank goodness for that.\u2019\u201d Then he told them he did have his own place. And Sue says she really was convinced he was thriving. However, on his occasional returns to Ashford, Mark seemed to be anything but thriving. His mental health had deteriorated and his delusions had got worse. \u201cOne time he said: \u2018I\u2019ve got to go, I\u2019m meeting Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9 tonight,\u2019\u201d Tony says. \u201cI said: \u2018Have a nice time, Hump.\u2019 Then he\u2019d tell us that Roman Abramovich had lent him his yacht.\u201d Did he say things like this when he lived in Ashford? \u201cYeah, but it just got worse,\u201d Sue says. \u201cOne of the last times he came down, he said: \u2018I met Rebecca and Dad up town and they\u2019re coming back.\u2019\u201d She doesn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry, so she does a bit of both. \u201cThat\u2019s when I knew how ill he was. He really believed it.\u201d Occasionally he told Tony the truth. \u201cWe\u2019d be up till six or seven in the morning just chatting about old times and chewing the fat, and he\u2019d say: \u2018You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to go in bins and search for food.\u2019 That really kicked the stomach out of me; to think he had to do that.\u201d Sue shakes her head. \u201cHe never said anything like that to me. He always made out he was all right up there.\u201d \u201cHe weren\u2019t,\u201d Tony tells her gently. \u201cHe weren\u2019t, Mum.\u201d Sue says she still doesn\u2019t understand why Mark went to Scotland. Tony tells her Mark said that people like him were better supported in Glasgow than Ashford. As with the rest of Britain, there is a homelessness crisis in Scotland. Shelter Scotland figures show that in 2018-19, 36,465 homeless applications were made and 29,894 households were assessed as homeless by their local authority. In Glasgow, 5,679 homeless applications were made in 2018-19, from a population of 608,000. But Scotland is also making a serious attempt to address its crisis. The country is piloting Housing First in five of its biggest cities, based on models that have been used successfully in places as diverse as Finland and New York. Housing First is founded on the principle that people with complex needs are provided with a home and wraparound services at the same time. It is, though, a slow and expensive process. In Glasgow, the hope is that, over five years, 600 people will be taken off the streets or out of emergency accommodation and provided with homes. In March, it was revealed that 139 people had died in Scotland on the streets or in temporary or supported homeless accommodation over the past 18 months. One thing that devastates the Starr family is how long it took them to find out that Mark was dead. Tony says Police Scotland was efficient and supportive. It contacted Kent police immediately to inform them about Mark. And that\u2019s when things went awry. Kent police turned up at the doorstep of Sue\u2019s house, but by then she was living with a friend. The person now living in Sue\u2019s house has since told her that he passed her new address to the police. But the police never got in touch with her. When she heard that Kent police were looking for her, she phoned them, but was told by an officer that he knew nothing about the matter. Mark holding Tony\u2019s son, Jude, a few days after his birth It is early September, more than two months since Mark died, and Kent police has still not spoken to the family, let alone apologised (though it does a couple of months later). Tony says this has made the grieving process much more painful. He feels he never got the chance to say a proper goodbye to his brother. Tony decides to come to Scotland with us to find out more about Mark\u2019s final months. He hopes it might provide the family with some kind of closure. Sue says she would find it too upsetting, but is glad he is doing it on the family\u2019s behalf. What is she hoping he will find out? \u201cIt\u2019s a silly question, really, but was he happy up there?\u201d She smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s a strange thing to say isn\u2019t it? Happy on the street. But I know he was happy there sometimes.\u201d * * * It is early morning in mid-October, and we\u2019re on the train to Glasgow. Tony has already cracked open a few cans of heavy-duty lager. It\u2019s hard to know whether it\u2019s dutch courage or habit. Sometimes, he says, he will only drink a couple of cans in a day; sometimes many more. He likes to smoke cannabis, too, but has never used class A drugs. He\u2019s terrified of them \u2013 he saw what they did to Mark. Tony has also had a tough life. He has anxiety and depression, and says that, in his 20s, there was a year after a relationship ended when he could barely set foot outside his house. When he and Jude\u2019s mother split up, he looked after Jude. In December 2003, two people turned up at his house demanding that he hand over Jude. Tony refused and was stabbed in the face. One of the assailants was subsequently jailed, and the incident left Tony with post-traumatic stress disorder. Soon after the attack, Tony won custody of Jude. Tony has not worked since then, and has struggled financially. There have been times, he says, when it could easily have been him homeless as well as Mark. \u201cI\u2019ve had letters saying: \u2018We\u2019re going to evict you.\u2019 It can happen to anybody. It\u2019s really scary. Two years ago, there was a mix-up with the council, I fell briefly behind with rent and they went straight to eviction proceedings.\u201d Tony is feeling emotional. He says he had to make this trip because Mark would have done the same for him. He takes out a photo \u2013 the last picture taken of the two brothers. Tony is topless, and they both look a little the worse for wear. \u201cHe was a bit bony by then. You know my last memory of Humpy is him walking down the path and me saying: \u2018I love you, Hump.\u2019 He said: \u2018I love you too, bruv.\u2019 That\u2019s the last words I said to Humpy. I had a sixth sense something was going to happen. I told a few friends, I\u2019m going to get a phone call soon.\u201d The last picture taken of Mark and Tony Starr together He is also thinking about the good times, not all of them from childhood. Six years ago, they saw the Rolling Stones play in Hyde Park \u2013 one of the best days of their life, he says. \u201cWe were stood in a posh pub in our shorts smoking a joint. I think we got away with it \u2019cos the Stones were playing. We went to some blinding concerts, but that was the best. Unbelievable. It was the last concert we went to. I\u2019ll cherish that memory.\u201d He opens another can. \u201cThere\u2019s only one Humpy Starr, believe me. He was unique.\u201d * * * \u201cExcuse me, love, you don\u2019t recognise this fella, do you? It\u2019s my brother.\u201d Tony kneels down to talk to a young homeless woman on the street \u2013 a girl really. He shows her the picture. She doesn\u2019t recognise him, but they chat for a couple of minutes. It\u2019s almost midnight, and the street homeless people of Glasgow are bedding down for the night. Tony approaches a skinny man with a red pointy beard. Barry, who is in his late 30s, has been living on the streets for the best part of 20 years and looks like a cross between Billy Connolly and Worzel Gummidge. He doesn\u2019t recognise Mark either, but he forms an instant bond with Tony. Barry says he would rather be on the streets than in the hostels because they are loud, dirty and violent. \u201cHow d\u2019you cope? Blimey, you must be battle hardened by now, Barry?\u201d Tony says. \u201cAye, I\u2019m used to it. There have been a lot of deaths when it\u2019s been cold, but cold doesnae bother me. Some of the public can be all right, but you\u2019ve also got the ones that walk past and spit on you. You need to find somewhere safe at night in case a crowd come and set on you.\u201d Tony Starr and Semra, a homeless woman who knew Mark Outside our hotel, Semra hobbles past with a sleeping bag. She looks at the photo, and says she knew Mark. \u201cThat\u2019s a nice photo of you and your brother,\u201d she says. \u201cHe kept himself to himself. He wasnae a troublemaker. He was quite funny. There were scumbags who if you injected and OD\u2019d, the bastards would run away and take you for everything. He wasnae like that.\u201d Tony asks her if he was still on drugs? \u201cHe was still using. He was doing rock [crack cocaine]. But he was never a drinker. Just the odd can.\u201d Semra says she has been turned away from a hostel for being abusive, but insists she was just bantering with a friend. She has been homeless for some time, but this is her first night on the street and she\u2019s terrified. \u201cThey told me to sleep under a camera so I can\u2019t be murdered. What fucking chance have I got?\u201d She pauses, and looks at Tony. \u201cYou can see the sadness in your eyes. You can see the hurt. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.\u201d Tony says her account of Mark rings true. \u201cHe didn\u2019t really drink, but he did like his crack.\u201d Most important to Tony, she said Mark was a good man. Soon after getting to Glasgow, we receive a call from the council press office \u2013 just guidance, they say. They tell us that Mark did have accommodation, but he was evicted twice \u2013 once after uncapped needles were found in his temporary home, and another time for being aggressive. Tony is upset when I tell him the news. He says he has never known Mark to be aggressive. Yes, he says, he would fight back if provoked, but that\u2019s all. Shelter Scotland call us to say it has information that may be of interest to Tony. We rush over to its offices, where we meet the community hub manager Davy MacIver and the senior development worker Stephen Wishart. They make for a good double act \u2013 MacIver small and quietly spoken, Wishart big and combative. Shelter\u2019s role is to ensure that the statutory rights of homeless people are being met. And it turns out that it has just begun, for the first time in its history, legal action against Glasgow city council for failing to provide accommodation for homeless people. Scotland has a simple rule \u2013 when people are having a homeless application assessed, the council has a duty to provide temporary accommodation for them. Those who have been denied the right to emergency accommodation are said to have been \u201cgatekept\u201d. Shelter decided to take legal action against the council after the council\u2019s own figures revealed that 3,365 applications for temporary accommodation had not been fulfilled in the year up to March 2019, compared with 3,055 over the previous 12 months \u2013 a 10% increase. What\u2019s more, Shelter has evidence that Mark Starr was gatekept at least twice this year. The reasons given for the gatekeeping are shocking. Shelter shows us Mark\u2019s case notes. \u201cClient [was] accommodated until last week (30/4) in the Copland Rd hotel. He travelled to England for a day trip for family bereavement and on his return [was] notified that his accommodation was closed and has not been accommodated since.\u201d \u201cFor about a week he was sleeping rough and couldn\u2019t get accommodated again,\u201d says MacIver. \u201cThat\u2019s when we come in. We would have assisted him with his legal requirement to accommodation.\u201d On another occasion he was gatekept after giving up a temporary furnished flat when he had started hearing voices. Again, the council failed to provide him with emergency accommodation. Shelter says the last time it saw him, it helped him find accommodation, but it didn\u2019t see him in the final month of his life, and doesn\u2019t know how he ended up back on the streets. He was due to meet Shelter on 28 June for help with his personal independence payment claim. He didn\u2019t turn up. That was the day he died, a day before his 54th birthday. Tony asks whether there is any reference to violent behaviour in the case notes. \u201cNo,\u201d Wishart says. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to be one of the clients who have been asked to leave places for violence \u2026 it was never an issue. But I\u2019ve seen people asked to leave these places for cheek rather than aggression, and we\u2019re told it\u2019s aggression. But then when you look at it, it\u2019s someone telling them to F-off.\u201d Barry, who has been living on the streets for nearly 20 years Tony tells them his mother wants to know whether Mark was happy in Glasgow. He knows the answer, but he still feels he has to ask on behalf of Sue. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say he seemed unhappy, if that makes sense,\u201d Wishart says. \u201cGiven his circumstances, he was engaging. We get a lot of angry people in here, but Mark wasn\u2019t like that. He was never up, never down, always even. Mark was a nice guy.\u201d Tony mentions that the council said he had been evicted for leaving uncapped needles on the floor of his flat. MacIver gives a despairing look. \u201cPrivate accommodation providers aren\u2019t set up to cope with the situations they\u2019re having to deal with,\u201d he says. \u201cTheir response is to have a zero-tolerance policy because that\u2019s the only thing they can effectively manage. You need properly resourced providers with specialist provision. Private landlords are not going to do the trick.\u201d They talk about the Housing First model being rolled out gradually across Glasgow, and say it\u2019s wonderful \u2013 in principle. \u201cHousing First is actually designed for people like Mark,\u201d Wishart says. \u201cYet I sit in meetings and hear about people being too complex for Housing First. So what are they not too complex for? Or are they just never to have a house? Is that it? OK, well, let\u2019s just throw the towel in because we\u2019re in the wrong game. Anyway, don\u2019t get me started.\u201d But it\u2019s too late. Wishart is fuming. What would victory look like in the battle against the council? \u201cThat\u2019s easy to answer,\u201d says Wishart. \u201cThat people like Mark who approach the local authority and make a homeless application and ask for emergency accommodation, they get it.\u201d Tony is impressed by their passion \u2013 and the fact that Mark may be one of the test cases in the legal action. As we leave, he makes an impromptu speech in praise of Scotland. \u201cI\u2019m thankful for what you\u2019ve told me. Humpy was born in England, but died a son of Scotland. He loved the Glasgow people. I\u2019ve only been here a day, but I can see why. I\u2019ll be coming back.\u201d Wherever we go we bump into Barry on the streets, and he\u2019s brimming with ideas about where Tony might find people who knew Mark. He suggests we visit the City Mission day centre. At night its building serves as emergency accommodation for homeless people. The main hall is packed with people chatting at tables, eating and playing pool. Margaret, a middle-aged woman with a kindly, prematurely aged face, smiles affectionately when she sees the photo of Mark. \u201cHe was lonesome,\u201d she tells Tony. \u201cMe and my pals would sit next to him and talk to him. I talked to him all the time. He\u2019d say: \u2018I\u2019m down.\u2019 It was sad.\u201d Tony asks her if Mark was a drinker? Tony seems to use the answer as a gauge of reliability. \u201cNo,\u201d Margaret says. \u201cHe just liked the one can.\u201d He asks what it\u2019s like to sleep rough. \u201cIt\u2019s horrible. People sleep under bridges by Central station and people spit on them and kick them. A guy got stabbed last week on the other side of the bridge. It\u2019s dangerous, aye. Dangerous.\u201d Tony hugs her as we leave. * * * The next day we meet SNP councillor Mhairi Hunter, Glasgow city council\u2019s convener for health and social care. Hunter says she is proud of the homelessness work the council is doing with Housing First, and explains how radical it is because homeless people no longer need to prove themselves \u201ctenancy ready\u201d when they move in. However admirable the model, it means little to Tony, and he can no longer hold back. \u201cWe found out by law my brother should have been housed,\u201d Tony says. \u201cYes,\u201d Hunter says, gently. \u201cThree times he had to find somewhere to live and he was on the streets.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t talk in detail about your brother\u2019s case, but there can be circumstances where people get asked to leave accommodation,\u201d Hunter says. \u201cSee, I\u2019m thinking if my brother had been put somewhere and he got help that he needed, he could still be alive today.\u201d Hunter nods silently. Would she accept that the council has failed to fulfil its duty to homeless people? \u201cA hundred per cent,\u201d she says. \u201cThose figures are provided by us, and it\u2019s part of our system to record every instance where somebody isn\u2019t accommodated.\u201d So is she glad that Shelter is mounting its legal challenge? \u201cNo, I find Shelter really difficult to work with to be honest,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen we came into administration [in Glasgow in 2017], it was clear that we had a dysfunctional homelessness system \u2013 that we have failed people, and that we have had significant failures in our systems. I\u2019m not saying Shelter shouldn\u2019t challenge us, but I would like them to work with us to improve the system.\u201d She says the SNP-run council is making progress, but Shelter hasn\u2019t given it enough time. \u201cYou can\u2019t just shut the system down and reboot it. It has to happen incrementally. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a five-year plan. I would absolutely not say our homelessness systems are fit for purpose because I know they are not.\u201d Hunter has a point. The very fact that it is unlawful to deny homeless people temporary accommodation in Scotland is a sign of how seriously it takes the issue. As is the fact that Glasgow city council itself provides figures for the number of times it has failed to accommodate people in temporary accommodation \u2013 the stick with which Shelter can beat it. But the bottom line, as Hunter acknowledges, is that the council has acted unlawfully. * * * It\u2019s a beautiful, cold, fresh day in Glasgow Green. Tony has brought Mark\u2019s ashes to scatter over the Nelson Monument, close to where he died. He opens the box, throws them into the air and breaks down. \u201cThere you go, Hump. There you go, bruv.\u201d He kisses the memorial and crosses himself. \u201cI love you, Hump. God bless you, brother. Will you keep a space for me up there, Humpy? Take care, bruv. I love you.\u201d Tony Starr spreads his brother\u2019s ashes on Glasgow Green where Mark died. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian After gathering himself, he phones Sue to tell her he has scattered Mark\u2019s ashes. She asks him what he has found out about Mark\u2019s time in Glasgow. He tells her that he has met people who knew him, and that they have only good things to say about him. He doesn\u2019t say anything about whether Mark was happy here in his final days. When he puts the phone down, he tells us he has been shocked to discover the life Mark was leading. \u201cI didn\u2019t think he\u2019d go downhill like this. I really didn\u2019t. He had a hard life up here \u2013 on his own, a lot of the time wandering around the streets, freezing cold, soaking wet, nothing to eat, treated like a dog, really.\u201d And yet, despite everything, he says something positive has come out of this. \u201cWalking in Humpy\u2019s footsteps, I felt closer to him,\u201d he says. \u201cBeing with the homeless in Glasgow has been very humbling. After hearing some of the stories. I can\u2019t believe the kindness they show.\u201d What was he expecting? \u201cTo be honest, I was expecting: \u2018No, I don\u2019t want to talk to you, F-off.\u2019 No one said that. I just think of Humpy being on a park bench somewhere, freezing cold, and Margaret turning up with her friends and trying to cheer him up. Some of the public think they\u2019re the dregs of society, yet they\u2019ve got more kindness, more resilience, more compassion ... they\u2019re unbelievable.\u201d As we head back south, Tony opens a can of lager. There is so much to tell the family, he says. No, he can\u2019t say Mark died happy or comfortably, but he thinks he can tell them something equally important. He talks about the Shelter case, and sitting in Mhairi Hunter\u2019s office telling her that Mark might still be here if the council had done right by him. And he talks about the possibility of Mark being cited as evidence that the council did not fulfil its statutory duty to the homeless people of Glasgow. He knows his family will continue to grieve for Mark, but maybe, just maybe, something good will come of his death. \u201cIf Humpy stops more people dying on the streets by holding the council to account,\u201d he says, \u201cthen his death won\u2019t have been in vain.\u201d Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or by emailing jo@samaritans.org If you are worried about becoming homeless, contact the housing department of your local authority to fill in a homeless application.
