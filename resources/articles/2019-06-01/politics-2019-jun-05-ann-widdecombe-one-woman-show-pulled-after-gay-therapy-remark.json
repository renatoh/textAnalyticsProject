The former Conservative minister and reality TV star was due to appear at the Landmark theatre in Ilfracombe, Devon, next March. But Selladoor, the company which runs the theatre, pulled the booking after Widdecombe told Sky News on Sunday that science might \u201cproduce an answer\u201d to being gay. David Hutchinson, the chief executive of Selladoor, said he was disgusted by Widdecombe\u2019s comments. On Tuesday the Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, defended Widdecombe\u2019s comments as a \u201cmatter of conscience\u201d. But Hutchinson said her remarks were indefensible and refused to \u201cprovide a stage for these vile people\u201d. He tweeted: \u201cTook no time in immediately cancelling her planned \u2018evening with\u2019 event at one of our Selladoor venues.\u201d He told the Stage that the show was booked before Widdecombe announced she would stand as an MEP for the Brexit party. He said: \u201cFollowing her disgusting gay therapy comments over the weekend, my programming team and I immediately decided to cancel the scheduled event as we flatly refuse to offer a stage to someone who wishes to promote such vile opinion.\u201d He added: \u201cWe welcome everyone in the community to our theatres, and operate a fully inclusive and respectful approach to programming. We don\u2019t seek to prevent discussions where there might be differences in opinion \u2013 but in this case, there is no discussion to be had. Ann\u2019s comments are divisive, disrespectful and foolishly ignorant.\u201d Widdecombe has not commented since her widely criticised remarks on Sunday. She told Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge: \u201cThe fact that we think it is now quite impossible for people to switch sexuality doesn\u2019t mean that science might not be able to produce an answer at some stage.\u201d Hutchinson said statements like that \u201cpromote and fuel discrimination\u201d and added: \u201cWe will not be complicit in providing a stage to air such views.\u201d Widdecombe\u2019s next performances of her one-woman show, Strictly Ann: An Evening With Ann Widdecombe, are due to go ahead in Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, next Tuesday and in Altrincham next Wednesday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
