Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored a late winner for United after Marcus Rashford had equalised for Mourinho\u2019s men at Ewood Park following Danny Graham\u2019s opener, and Chelsea lie in wait in the quarter-finals. Although Blackburn are currently second bottom in the Championship, United were made to work for their victory and Mourinho was pleased with his side\u2019s performance and attitude. \u201cThe attitude of the players was good,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes you have difficult matches because you make it difficult for yourself. Tonight was difficult because Blackburn made it difficult for us. They played well and fought very hard. They were very well organised. We had to play well and we had to play with attitude to be ready and get a result. \u201cI had answers from some players, for example Ashley Young, so I can rest Antonio Valencia. When Ashley Young plays in this way, I can rest Antonio Valencia. \u201cIt\u2019s possible to win three, two, one or nil [cup competitions this season]. But when we are in the competitions we are going to fight. We are going to fight for that, but obviously the League Cup is the one where we have 50% possibility of winning. We have to fight for the 50% to become a title, then the next one is to get a result against Saint-\u00c9tienne in the last 16. Step by step.\u201d Mourinho confirmed that David De Gea was rested at Blackburn and that both Rooney and Jones would miss Wednesday\u2019s Europa League game. The Portuguese said he was unsure if Rooney would return to full fitness for the League Cup final against Southampton. The Blackburn manager, Owen Coyle, was happy with his side\u2019s display and hopes it will provide confidence in their attempt to avoid relegation. He said: \u201cWhen we analyse the game I think we performed very well. I thought we were outstanding. Our cup finals start now on Friday at Burton.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
