Just last month we flagged up the visit to Balliol College of the Class War founder, Ian Bone. The proposition seemed a fiery one: \"The greatest contribution we could make to equality in this country would be to burn down Oxford University.\" He wouldn't do it, we said. But he does have friends. And so there was a meeting between Thames Valley police, officials at Balliol, and student members of the Left Caucus, who extended the invitation. And the upshot was that if the event went ahead, police might have to line the main street to ensure the forces of anarchism did not turn civilisation on its head. That would be expensive, costing thousands of pounds, and either the college or students would have to pay. Unsurprisingly, the college won't pay to bring anarchists to the dreaming spires and the Left Caucus \u2013 which would \u2013 doesn't have the money. So the challenge peters out, starved of funds, bamboozled by the establishment. Still, Rome wasn't sacked in a day. \u2022 The nationalisation of UK energy continues, with much of it now owned by foreign state-owned or state-subsidised companies. Happy days for them. Henri Proglio, the EDF boss, tells the French media that he expects between \"5,000 and 10,000\" jobs to be created in France by the UK deal. George Osborne said much the same here. A jobs bonanza? Or double-counting? Meanwhile, Areva, which has a 10% stake in the project, has seen its shares rise 20% higher than market expectations as its reward from the deal. Who dares say we are not good Europeans? \u2022 A busy rush hour in the capital, with commuters hustling to and fro. A stressful time, but Londoners queueing for their rail tickets at London Bridge cope with the usual equanimity. Only one does not. He broods, he simmers \u2013 and then, without warning, he boils over. \"Bloody National Rail,\" explodes the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, on his way to an appointment in Greenwich and presumably running late. \"They should let Transport for London run it.\" Of course, the mayor controls Transport for London, so in essence he is telling his fellow travellers how much better things would be with Boris in charge. Over time, even he has come to believe this. \u2022 But then, travelling alone to engagements in London has always provided a degree of challenge for the mayor. Who can forget in 2011 how he was forced to apologise to a crowd that had assembled to meet him in East Croydon, south London. He was late because he had headed by train for East Dulwich, several miles in the wrong direction. Both called East. Most confusing. \u2022 Interesting that he should present himself as the man to apply the smack of firm management. The prudent Boris deplores waste, excessive expenditure and the trousering of public funds by cronies. The other Boris doesn't seem bothered, as we see from the Evening Standard's revelations that staff in his first administration departed with \"golden goodbyes\" and loss-of-office payments worth hundreds of thousands of pounds, even though he won a second term and they didn't lose office. Enemies learn to steer clear. But friends find all for the best in this the best of all possible worlds. Especially financially. \u2022 Finally, a week in which German chancellor Angela Merkel gained more attention that she would have wanted, with controversy in Berlin and Washington at the suggestion that security services have been tapping her phone. And in London she was referenced by the cartoonist Gerald Scarfe, opening the much-praised Daumier exhibition at the Royal Academy. Daumier, he said, had been the satirical scourge of 19th-century Paris; just as Scarfe and today's cartoonists have sought to train a critical eye on contemporary figures. I have been sued by Mary Whitehouse, he said, and he then professed himself perplexed by complaints occasioned by a cartoon of Merkel breast-feeding two countries. \"What was all the fuss about, given how many willies I have drawn,\" protested Scarfe. Truly the revolutionary. Twitter: @hugh_muir"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
