Aldridge, 26, was due to train with Daley the following day in preparation for the National Championships, which began in Sheffield on Thursday. Instead he has been ruled out of action for at least two weeks after suffering two black eyes, a broken nose and requiring 10 stitches in his forehead after an incident he describes as an \"unprovoked attack\". British Diving is now under increased pressure to find Daley a new partner and the governing body's new performance director, the former Russia coach Alexei Evangulov, may well be charged with the task of solving that dilemma. Evangulov is in Sheffield this week to cast an eye over Britain's best diving talent. With Aldridge out of the picture Evangulov will be watching out for potential partners for Daley and Daley's coach, Andy Banks, hinted yesterday that a change was likely. \"There's a few kids looking to throw their weight around,\" Banks said. \"Everyone is looking to do their best individually and they'll put the two best together. It's nice there are two or three names in the frame.\" Those are thought to be James Milton, 14, Max Brick and Chris Mears \u2013 both 16. It is expected that a decision on the pairing will be made later this year, following performances at the World Championships, the synchro qualification for which takes place next month. For Aldridge, though, there is no question over his status as Daley's partner. \"I don't see there being any other ... there's not a team anywhere near us. There's nobody in this country at this precise moment in time that can stand next to Tom and dive with him the way that I can. That speaks for itself.\" The partnership has mostly been a very successful one \u2013 the two won the World Series, finished third in the World Championships and qualified for the Olympics last year after just a few months of working together. But the 12-year age gap between Daley and Aldridge, who room together for competitions, has often led to questions over the suitability of their pairing. Speculation reached boiling point when in Beijing the two had a very public bust-up blaming each other for their performance in the Olympic final where they finished in seventh place. The pairing has received much unwanted media attention after their Beijing dispute \u2013 including hate mail sent to Aldridge \u2013 and this recent incident will only pile on the pressure. \"Because I'm the adult I'm the one who always gets the raw deal,\" said Aldridge. \"The way the story's been written is I was out till the early hours of the morning and I had a fight outside a club. But I did nothing wrong. I got attacked, it's irrelevant where I was. People are going to speculate, 'He had a competition the following week, what's he out doing in a bar?' But I've still got a life.\" Three men were arrested in connection with the inquiry and then released on bail. The motivation for the alleged attack is as yet unclear, but Aldridge's personalised car with his name and face on was parked outside the bar. A British Swimming spokesman said: \"It's a shame Blake has had to withdraw from the championships and we wish him all the best with his recovery.\" Aldridge has admitted that missing out on Sheffield may have \"completely ruined\" his year. He is now unlikely to qualify for the 10m individual platform event at the World Championships this summer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
