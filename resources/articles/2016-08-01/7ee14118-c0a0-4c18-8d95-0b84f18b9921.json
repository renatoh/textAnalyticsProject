His rally in Iowa this afternoon was not even shown live on cable news networks, a rare event in Trump world. At the rally, he said about his opponent: \u201cShe\u2019s pretty close to unhinged. She\u2019s like an unbalanced person.\u201d According to multiple news outlets including CNN, Trump will be endorsing Paul Ryan for re-election at his Wisconsin rally this evening. Former CIA director Michael Morrell announced his endorsement of Hillary Clinton, as Donald Trump would, he believes, make the country less safe. \u201cFirst, Mrs Clinton is highly qualified to be commander in chief. I trust she will deliver on the most important duty of a president \u2013 keeping our nation safe. Second, Donald J Trump is not only unqualified for the job, but he may well pose a threat to our national security,\u201d wrote Morrell. On Monday Trump will give a speech on the US economy in Detroit. In emails about the speech from the Trump campaign, it says: \u201cAmericans will have two choices presented to them this November, to stay on the same path that has cost Americans millions of jobs, and declining incomes, or change that can finally allow Americans to reach their potential and become great again. Today\u2019s job report, however, shows the US added 255,000 jobs in July, with unemployment remaining steady. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange denied that Russia had any involvement in leaking DNC emails... on the same day that the Clinton campaign released an attack ad questioning the relationship between Trump and Russian president Vladimir Putin. Have a great weekend! And Trump is done. The music playing as he walked off stage in Iowa - at least on the ABC footage - is Rolling Stones\u2019 You Can\u2019t Always Get What You Want, which feels... weirdly appropriate for the GOP? \u201cIowa is an amazing place, you\u2019re going to keep your place in history, you\u2019re going to be that first state,\u201d said Trump. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like me, that\u2019s ok! Vote Pence,\u201d declared Trump. He\u2019s now talking about the dishonest media again and how it spins all his stories. \u201cLike that baby! That beautiful baby. I love that baby. I love that baby,\u201d said Trump. Trump talking about the $400 million given to Iran as part of a Hague payment deal, saying if he were president: \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t be getting 10c.\u201d \u201cPeople are amazed at how much I know about the military. The fair people are very impressed,\u201d said Trump at an Iowa rally. He\u2019s talking about Iran, the NATO deal, Obama - the speech is winding in several different directions. \u201cBy the way, did I make a great choice in Governor Pence? Mike Pence, that was a good decision... I will take my guy over their guy all day long,\u201d said Trump. Interesting note about this rally in Iowa today: Trump now reading from a statement from a union of border agents, the National Border Control Council, who have endorsed him. \u201cFrance is no longer France. But the United States will be the United States,\u201d he says. Trump complained about how after he asked a mother and her crying baby to leave a rally, the media made a big deal out of it. \u201cI don\u2019t throw babies out, believe me. I love my children, I love babies, believe me,\u201d he said in a singsong voice. \u201cIt\u2019s so disgusting what\u2019s going on with the media. That\u2019s why we have to win,\u201d said Trump. \u201cIf we don\u2019t pull this off, I\u2019m blaming Iowa. If we don\u2019t pull this off, I\u2019ve wasted a lot of money, time and energy, I\u2019m telling you,\u201d said Trump. Trump says he\u2019s personally spent over $60 million. Hillary Clinton \u201clacks the judgment, temperament and moral integrity to lead this country,\u201d declared Donald Trump at his rally in Iowa. Chants of \u201clock her up\u201d from the audience. \u201cShe\u2019s pretty close to unhinged. She\u2019s like an unbalanced person,\u201d said Trump. Trump talks about the US-Iran deal and says her involvement in it means \u201cshe is totally unfit to lead.\u201d Trump declares: If Hillary Clinton becomes president you will have terrorism, problems, really in my opinion, the destruction of this country from within. \u201cWe have a very hostile media. Hostile like no one can believe. I think I\u2019m going to write a book,\u201d says Trump in Iowa. He then says he will be talking today about \u201cthe queen of corruption.\u201d \u201cFor the sake of our soldiers who deserve a commander in chief who will have their back. For hardworking Americans and businesses who will get Washington DC off their back. And for the sack of the Supreme Court that will never turn its back on the constitution,\u201d announces Pence, as Donald Trump walks out to the tune of All Right Now by Free. \u201cWe must decide here and now that Hillary Clinton must never become president of the United States,\u201d said Mike Pence, who seems much more fiery after a week of hosting his own events. Pence calls Trump a \u201ctruth teller, a man who will stand strong on the world stage.\u201d \u201cWhen Donald Trump is president of the United State of America, the change will be yuge!\u201d laughs Pence, with the Des Moines rally all then repeating \u201cyuge! yuge!\u201d Mike Pence, VP pick for Trump, is introducing Trump at a rally in Iowa. \u201cWe are united, this movement is united, and we\u2019re going to elect Donald Trump as the next president,\u201d said Pence. A Politico photographer just tweeted the email he received from the Trump campaign denying him media credentials. Politico reporters have been regularly blacklisted from Trump events for months now, with Washington Post, Daily Beast, Buzzfeed, Univision and The Guardian all banned at various points. Trump threatened to ban the New York Times recently as he argued it would improve their media coverage of him. Too bad if a Donald Trump supporter changes their mind - currently there\u2019s no option to unsubscribe from a reoccurring payment to the Trump campaign. A CNN reporter tweeted this from a former Trump supporter who no longer wanted to give the campaign his cash. Mic then investigated what happens when you sign up for a Trump donation, and quickly realized there is no way to end the payments - you can adjust the credit card, but not delete it. In contrast, Clinton\u2019s campaign does offer an unsubscribe option for those no longer wishing to donate. Currently no FEC rules exist for this issue, reports Mic: The Federal Election Commission does not have rules explicitly about the cancellation of recurring campaign contributions, said FEC spokesperson Christian Hilland. \u201cOur regulations do not speak specifically to that issue,\u201d he said. The only way problems with recurring donations would trigger an investigation, he explained, was if the total added up to more than the federally mandated maximum donation of $2,700. A fight between a Donald Trump-supporting husband and a Hillary Clinton-loving wife ended in domestic violence and a felony charge for battery, Florida Police told The Smoking Gun website. Lawrence Littman, a 78-year-old registered Republican was charged with throwing his wife Elvia, 73, to the floor of their home after \u201chaving an argument over politics.\u201d The incident took place on Wednesday evening at 10pm. In the police report, published online, Evlia told police her husband of 20 years \u201ccalled her many derogatory names and then grabbed her wrist and threw her on a chair in the bedroom.\u201d After she then tried to leave the disagreement, by going to the other side of the house, she alleges that Littman followed her \u201cgrabbed her by the arm again and slung her to the ground.\u201d Littman claims that his wife tried to slap him in the face while they argued over politics. \u201cShe said that this is when he shoved her back and she slipped and fell to the ground, according to the police report. Although the police report does not name either Trump or Clinton, police told The Smoking Gun the fight was about the presidential race. Elvia is a registered Democrat, with current voter status. A recent poll shows Hillary Clinton with a small lead in Florida. Clinton has criticized Trump for allowing violence to bloom at his rallies. \u201c\u2018He created an environment in which it seemed to be acceptable for someone running for president to be inciting violence, to be encouraging his supporters,\u201d she said in June. Seems Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine have a very blue-toned book (well, it is a blueprint for America\u2019s Future) coming out. A video of the clever question Clinton was asked today about the most meaning conversation she\u2019s had with an African-American friend (includes her \u201cthey\u2019ve tried to expand my musical taste\u201d line, which we\u2019re still laughing at). A new poll shows Clinton ahead in Georgia, a deep south state that\u2019s elected the GOP nominee every election since 1996. She leads Trump 41-38 in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll, with Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson nabbing 11% of the vote. Seems like Trump\u2019s VP pick Mike Pence is enjoying himself on the campaign trail: Clinton was asked on the most meaningful conversation she\u2019s had with an African-American friend. \u201cI\u2019m blessed to have a crew of friends... They\u2019ve supported me, they\u2019ve chastised me, raised issues with me, they\u2019ve tried to expand my musical tastes,\u201d said Clinton. Question from a Washington Post reporter: \u201cHow would you lead a nation where a majority of Americans mistrust you?\u201d Clinton points out her record during her legal career, as a NY Senator, as Secretary of State. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make me feel good when people say those things and I recognize I have work to do,\u201d she said, noting that she won reelection in New York with 67% of the vote and was popular with the American people after serving as Secretary of State. \u201cAsk yourselves, were 67% of the people in New York wrong? Were 66% of the American public? Or maybe just maybe when I\u2019m running for a job, there\u2019s a real benefit on those on the other side to stir up as much trouble as possible,\u201d said Clinton. Seems Donald Trump may finally endorse Speaker Paul Ryan for re-election. Clinton questioned on some of the racist and sexist comments that Trump has made and why those seems accepted by some of his supporters. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to understand what it is that has driven people who support Trump. I have met with them. I have listened to them,\u201d said Clinton, talking about dissatisified manufacturing and factory workers in small towns. \u201cWe have to recognize that of course some of the appeal is xenophobic and racist and sexist and appeals. But let\u2019s not lose sight of the real pain that many Americans are feeling because the economy has left them behind,\u201d said Clinton, noting that she went to West Virginia, knowing she would not win West Virginia. Clinton asked about her endorsement by CIA director Mike Morrell and Morrell\u2019s discussion of Trump\u2019s relationship with Russia. \u201cI will let his comments speak for themselves. But I really appreciated his explaining, as he did in his op ed, what\u2019s at stake in this election,\u201d said Clinton. Next question: about her private email scandal and if she wanted to clarify inconsistencies. \u201cMy answers were truthful,\u201d said Clinton. \u201cI have acknowledged repeatedly that using two email accounts was a mistake and I take responsibility for that. But my answers to the FBI were truthfully, and I should add, consistent to what I said publicly,\u201d she said. Then went into a big description about how the classified emails that were sent to her did not have the classified markers on them which would identify them as classified. Next question: How do you walk back the deportations and not inherit the title of deporter-in-chief, as President Obama is sometimes dubbed by Latinos? \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be deporting hard working people and breaking up families ... that\u2019s how I\u2019m going to directing the Homeland of Security to act,\u201d said Clinton. She says she is \u201coptimistic\u201d that enough political will is there and that voters can decide with their votes to support candidates with immigration reform stances. First question: how can Hillary Clinton push through immigration reform, when President Obama struggled so much and the House will remain under Republican control? Clinton\u2019s response: \u201cI\u2019ll start immediately and make it a clear high priority for my administration.\u201d Said she\u2019s hoping there\u2019s a good chance for a Democratic Senate, pick up some seats in the House and narrow the numbers. She says make a move in the Senate and demand a vote in the House, noting Marco Rubio\u2019s previous push for immigration reform. \u201cI view the political landscape as increasing favorable for us making this happen,\u201d said Clinton. She also noted that the executive orders by Obama are not yet killed, since the Supreme Court 4-4 decision simply sent it back to a lower court. \u201cAs Ida B Wells once said \u2018be people must know before they can act, and no educator to compare with the press,\u2019\u201d said Clinton at the NABJ/NAHJ convention in DC. \u201cIt\u2019s a badge of honor when Jorge Ramos [reporter for Univision[ gets thrown out of a press conference for questioning Donald Trump,\u201d said Clinton, noting other reporters have been booted from Trump\u2019s events. \u201cI hope you keep calling it like you see it. Keep holding all of us to account,\u201d said Clinton. \u201cThank you for what you do everyday. Thank you for inviting. I look forward to taking some of your questions,\u201d said Clinton. She\u2019s taking questions! Clinton just asked journalists in DC to compare the priced policies of her and Donald Trump\u2019s policies. An amusing little slip of the tongue though, she said \u201cmy hus...\u201d before correcting herself to \u201cmy opponent.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s harking back to the most shameful chapters of our history and appealing to the most ugly impulses in our society,\u201d said Clinton. She\u2019s specifically noting issues relevant to Hispanic and black reporters - curtailing press freedom, retweeting white nationalists, questioning the credibility of a Mexican-born judge. Hillary Clinton is now addressing the National Association of Black Journalists/National Association of Hispanic Journalists convention. She\u2019s speaking about what she\u2019ll do in her first 100 days, including immigration reform and banning jobs asking for whether candidates have a criminal record while applying for a job (a policy that already exists in New York City. \u201cThey can be judged by their skills and talents, not be their past,\u201d said Clinton. The ex-CIA director who came out in support of Hillary Clinton today, quit his job as a CBS News analyst so he could make a public political stand. Michael Morrell has been a CBS News contributor since 2014, but gave notice recently. Today he wrote in the New York Times: My training as an intelligence officer taught me to call it as I see it. This is what I did for the CIA. This is what I am doing now. Our nation will be much safer with Hillary Clinton as president. \u201cYes, essentially, he did make sure to sever ties before doing anything political,\u201d a CBS source told Politico. The Clinton campaign just released a new attack ad showing the \u201calarming closeness\u201d between Donald Trump and Russian president Vladimir Putin. \u201cWe don\u2019t know why Trump praises Putin... we don\u2019t know why Putin praises Trump,\u201d it reads, with footage of Trump speaking about Putin\u2019s \u201cleadership\u201d. It shows video of Trump\u2019s advisors ties to Russia and others discussing Trump\u2019s own business ties to the country. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on here and Trump won\u2019t tell us,\u201d says the video. It\u2019s a rare event when Donald Trump admits he was wrong, but he did this morning. Trump claimed in a rally in Portland, Maine yesterday that he had seen footage of the plane delivering $400 million in cash - sent in euros, Swiss francs and other currencies - to Iran from the United States government, as part of an outstanding claim from a Hague trial. But today, he admitted that he hadn\u2019t watched money plane footage. Instead, he\u2019d seen video of a plane full of rescued Americans. Founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange denies that Russia had any involvement in the leak of 20,000 DNC emails just days before the convention took place in Philadelphia, but warns that more emails are to come. In an interview with RT - a Russian TV news networks funded by the Russian government - Assange said he was speaking after Hillary Clinton made the connection publicly between WikiLeaks and Russia. \u201cI think it\u2019s necessary to address what WikiLeaks feels is its perception of its own publication,\u201d said Assange, in a minute video sent by RT. The whole interview will air tomorrow. Assange said that because Russian language appeared in the metadata of the documents (the digital information), people assumed it was the Russian government. Assange said: There are claims that in the metadata (someone\u2019s done a document to PDF conversion, and the, in some cases the language of the computer that was used for that conversion was Russian. So that\u2019s circumstantial evidence that some Russian was involved or someone who wanted to make it look like a Russian was involved. That\u2019s not the case for the material that we released. The leaked emails showed the DNC actively trying undermine Bernie Sander\u2019s campaign for president, and as a result of the leak chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz - and other other DNC execs - resigned. Today Hillary Clinton will face a crowd she normally avoids speaking to en masse: journalists. At 12pm, she\u2019ll speak at the NABJ &amp; NAHJ convention in Washington DC, which is the biggest annual convention of black and Hispanic reporters. Clinton hasn\u2019t held a press conference since December, a fact Donald Trump likes to point out about his opponent regularly. \u201cSo, it\u2019s been 235 days since crooked Hillary Clinton has had a press conference,\u201d Trump said during a press conference in Miami on July 27. \u201cYou, as reporters who give her all of these glowing reports, should ask yourselves why.\u201d Clinton took a handful of questions from reporters on Sunday, and says she\u2019s done over 300 interviews with the media. Her appearance at today\u2019s convention is not a press conference - and it\u2019s not clear if questions will even be taken - but with that many reporters, it might be hard to ignore them. In another blow to the Trump campaign, the former acting CIA director Michael Morrell has endorsed Hillary Clinton for president \u2013 and detailed his reasons for thinking Donald Trump would, should he fill the role, make the US less safe. Writing an op ed for the New York Times, Morrell first details his qualification for making such a call. It is quite convincing: During a 33-year career at the Central Intelligence Agency, I served presidents of both parties \u2013 three Republicans and three Democrats. I was at President George W Bush\u2019s side when we were attacked on September 11; as deputy director of the agency, I was with President Obama when we killed Osama bin Laden in 2011. Then he discusses his own political leanings: I am neither a registered Democrat nor a registered Republican. In my 40 years of voting, I have pulled the lever for candidates of both parties. As a government official, I have always been silent about my preference for president. No longer. On November 8, I will vote for Hillary Clinton. Between now and then, I will do everything I can to ensure that she is elected as our 45th president. His reasons for his decision, subsequently explained, are what you might have imagined they might be: First, Mrs Clinton is highly qualified to be commander in chief. I trust she will deliver on the most important duty of a president \u2013 keeping our nation safe. Second, Donald J Trump is not only unqualified for the job, but he may well pose a threat to our national security. Morrell then emphasises two reasons he thinks Trump poses such a threat: his apparent susceptibility to and constant praise for Vladimir Putin of Russia \u2013 \u201ca career intelligence officer\u201d who Morrell says, in as many words, has been playing Trump like a violin \u2013 and his proposed ban on Muslims entering the country. In lieu of copy-and-pasting the whole piece, which is tempting, here\u2019s the ending: In fact, many Muslim Americans play critical roles in protecting our country, including the man, whom I cannot identify, who ran the CIA\u2019s Counterterrorism Center for nearly a decade and who I believe is most responsible for keeping America safe since the September 11 attacks. My training as an intelligence officer taught me to call it as I see it. This is what I did for the CIA. This is what I am doing now. Our nation will be much safer with Hillary Clinton as president. Good morning, and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s campaign liveblog. Donald Trump\u2019s no good very bad week continues, with more Republicans declining to support their nominee and calling for him to drop out. A Politico panel of GOP activists and insiders from 11 swing states said they wanted Trump to fire himself \u2013 but the candidate is ignoring it all. Trump is trying to turn things around with an announcement on Friday morning of the Trump Economic Advisory Council, after Thursday\u2019s news that he is heading to Detroit on Monday for a big economic speech. He promises to discuss: Americans will have two choices presented to them this November, to stay on the same path that has cost Americans millions of jobs, and declining incomes, or change that can finally allow Americans to reach their potential and become great again. Today\u2019s job report, however, shows the US added 255,000 jobs in July, with unemployment remaining steady. Trump\u2019s campaign said his group of counsellors is \u201ccomprised of some of the top economists in the country as well as the most successful industry leaders in finance, real estate and technology\u201d. They are: Steve Roth (real estate billionaire), Harold Hamm (billionaire oilman), Howard Lorber (real estate executive), Steven Mnuchin (banker and film director), Tom Barrack (real estate investor), Stephen M Calk (banker), John Paulson (hedge fund billionaire), Andy Beal (banker) and Steve Feinberg (hedge fund billionaire). Plus, the following as advisers: David Malpass, Peter Navarro, Stephen Moore and Dan DiMicco. In today\u2019s movements: Hillary Clinton is speaking at the NABJ/NAHJ convention (a joint convention by the national associations for black and Hispanic journalists) in Washington DC. Her VP pick, Tim Kaine, is at an event in Grand Rapids, Michigan, before heading over to Milwaukee. Trump and his VP, Mike Pence, will hold a rally in Des Moines, Iowa, at 3pm CT (4pm ET). Then they\u2019ll head to Green Bay, Wisconsin, for a rally at 7pm CT (8pm ET). Thanks for joining us."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
