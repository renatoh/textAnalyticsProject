The broadcaster has told all full-time employees earning over \u00a360,000 a year that they will receive no pay increase in 2009, with around one in 10 employees affected by the freeze. ITV is also imposing below-inflation increases on staff earning more than \u00a325,000. The austerity measures come at a time when the broadcaster is facing an unprecedented cash crunch, with advertising revenues plunging steeply. The company has axed shows such as Heartbeat and Wire in the Blood, shelved costly period drama A Passage to India and cut back on some of its key talent deals. And some of ITV's costliest stars, Simon Cowell, Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, have reportedly been warned they may no longer be offered generous golden handcuffs deals when current arrangements end at the end of the year. But the new parsimonious age has already set in for ITV's staff. The company recently set out the its pay deal for 2009, which follows three months of negotiations with the unions. Those earning between \u00a325,001 and \u00a340,000 will get 2.5% on top of their basic salary, while those earning \u00a340,001 to \u00a358,750 will receive an increase of just 2.1%. The narrow band of executives earning between \u00a358,750 and \u00a359,999 will have their pay topped up to \u00a360,000. Only those who currently earn below \u00a325,000 will receive a pay rise of 4.2%, equivalent to the rate of inflation in October. The pay freeze at the top will affect the executive chairman, Michael Grade, the chief operating officer, John Cresswell, and the managing director of ITV brand and commercial, Rupert Howell. The trio's salaries were already frozen last year at 2007 levels. Grade was paid \u00a3813,000 in basic salary in 2007, while Cresswell earns \u00a3575,000 and Howell's salary is set at \u00a3450,000. In an email to staff, ITV said a tapering arrangement would ensure that employees with a salary close to the limits of the pay bands would receive a \"fair\" pay award. \"The award ensures that nearly 90% of us will receive an increase in basic pay and supports ITV's aim of ensuring that the vast majority of people receive a pay increase at a time of uncertainty in the wider economy,\" the company said in the email. \"We appreciate the hard work, dedication and loyalty all staff have shown during the last year and are pleased we have reached agreement to confirm this pay award,\" said Andy Doyle, the acting group HR Director. \"In this difficult and challenging climate we have to give serious consideration to all spending, and our pay bill is one of our biggest overall costs,\" an ITV spokesman said. \"ITV considered all the available options, including a blanket pay freeze across the entire company for the coming year, but the solution we have arrived at will ensure that the vast majority of employees receive a pay increase. \"The board, senior leadership and all employees earning in excess of \u00a360,000 will not receive a pay increase in 2009. Our proposal aims to ensure that those staff who are earning the least benefit the most from the funds that we have available.\" Along with the rest of the media sector, ITV is suffering badly from the worst advertising downturn in memory. The decline in revenues is made worse for the broadcaster the contract rights renewal system, which pegs advertising rates to TV ratings. The market share of flagship channel ITV1 has been falling for many years, mainly as a result of the growth of multichannel television, although ITV has often failed to deliver enough prime time hits. The company is in the process of cutting about 1,000 jobs, including about 430 people in the ITV News division, a move designed to save \u00a340m. It has already announced plans to save another \u00a335m across the company by 2010 and is working with the Boston Consulting Group to identify further potential cost savings of around \u00a325m. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
