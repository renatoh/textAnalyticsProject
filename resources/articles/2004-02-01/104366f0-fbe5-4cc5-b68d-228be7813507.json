Clear Channel's below par radio results come in contrast to an expected speech from the WPP chief Martin Sorrell on Friday, heralding the end of the worst TV advertising recession in living memory. The company, which has often been touted as a buyer for UK radio assets including Capital, reported a decline in fourth quarter radio revenues of just over \u00a311.7m ($22m) compared to the same period last year. The company, which also owns venues including the Carling Apollo in west London, blamed a decline in local advertising for the fall but said the termination of sports rights deals and lower revenues at its nationally syndicated stations also affected results. Clear Channel has been struggling to rebuild its image after allegations that it ran formulaic playlists, and has been troubled by an overall decline in radio listening in America. Independent figures show that radio audiences have fallen dramatically since 1999. Admitting that 2003 had been a \"challenging economic period\", the Clear Channel chairman and chief executive, Lowry Mays, said overall revenues, including its outdoor advertising and live entertainment businesses, were \u00a34.75bn ($8.93bn) for the year, an increase of 6% on 2002. Despite a warning last November that radio advertising revenues were lagging behind other parts of the media, Clear Channel's fourth quarter earnings still fell short of Wall Street estimates. However the company said it expected earnings to rise over the next 12 months, boosted by both the Olympic Games and the US presidential election. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
