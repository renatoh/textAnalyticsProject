Acevedo, the daughter of Dominican immigrants, took the medal for her debut, The Poet X. A verse novel, it tells of a quiet Dominican girl, Xiomara, who joins her school\u2019s slam poetry club in Harlem and is, according to the judges, \u201ca searing, unflinching exploration of culture, family and faith within a truly innovative verse structure\u201d. Xiomara \u201ccomes to life on every page and shows the reader how girls and women can learn to inhabit, and love, their own skin\u201d. The book is dedicated to \u201call the little sisters yearning to see themselves\u201d, and one of her former students in particular. Acevedo was an eighth-grade English teacher in Maryland when the impetus for the novel struck her: one of her students, Katherine, wouldn\u2019t read any of the books Acevedo offered her, telling her : \u201cNone of these books are about us.\u201d So Acevedo set out to write \u201ca story that sounds like and depicts the same kind of neighbourhood\u201d she and her students are from. \u201cWhen your body takes up more room than your voice / you are always the target of well-aimed rumors, / which is why I let my knuckles talk for me,\u201d she writes in The Poet X. \u201cI\u2019ve forced my skin just as thick as I am.\u201d \u201cThis was a girl who physically seemed to be taking up so much space but felt she had to be withdrawn, she was afraid to push the boundaries,\u201d Acevedo said. \u201cHer body takes up so much attention it would be easy to forget all the things she\u2019s thinking, things she won\u2019t say. I wanted to be really close to those feelings and show the everyday magic and beauty that quiet folks can hold.\u201d Acevedo is no longer a teacher but she returns to the school where she taught every year, and knows that her former students, including Katherine, have read her novel. In her speech after winning the medal she said:\u201cI felt like this student had given me a challenge, or at least permission to to write a story about young people who take up space, who do not make themselves small, who learn the power of their own words.\u201d Acevedo\u2019s win comes two years after the prize instigated an independent review into its historical lack of racial diversity, following widespread anger at 2017\u2019s 20-book, entirely white longlist. After interviews with more than 600 people, from librarians to children, the review concluded that the UK\u2019s overwhelmingly white librarian workforce, who nominate books for the medal, were mostly unaware of titles by writers of colour. It also found a dearth of books by writers of colour were being published in the UK. Tuesday\u2019s ceremony also saw the illustrator Jackie Morris win the Kate Greenaway medal for illustration for The Lost Words, a response to the Oxford Junior Dictionary\u2019s decision to remove everyday nature words such as \u201cacorn\u201d, \u201cbluebell\u201d and \u201ckingfisher\u201d, as they were not being used enough by children. The book, written by Robert Macfarlane, features his poems alongside Morris\u2019s images of the excised words and has become a cultural phenomenon, with members of the public raising funds to ensure schools around the country have copies. Alison Brumwell, who chaired the panel of librarians who picked the winners, called it an \u201castonishing book which deserves the highest accolades\u201d. \u201cThe illustrations test our acuity and make us all think on a much deeper level about scale, colour and proportion; also, about representations of loss and absence. We are invited to \u2018read\u2019 on more than one level and to reflect upon a world in which change can mean irreparable loss, impoverishing both language and the environment,\u201d said Brumwell. Morris said that she believes the response to The Lost Words has been so strong because \u201cinstinctively, we know that we are not separate from nature, we\u2019re part of it\u201d. \u201cCertainly in urban environments, we\u2019ve almost divorced ourselves from a close connection with it, and I think there is a hunger to return to those connections \u2013 and it\u2019s also an enormous necessity,\u201d she said. Morris ended her acceptance speech on Tuesday with a call to her fellow authors and illustrators, artists and musicians \u201cto help to tell the truth about what is happening to this small and fragile world we inhabit, to re-engage with the natural world, to inspire and to imagine better ways to live. \u201cBecause there is no Planet B and we are at a turning point. And because in order to make anything happen it first needs to be imagined. And as writers and illustrators for children we grow the readers and thinkers of the future,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
