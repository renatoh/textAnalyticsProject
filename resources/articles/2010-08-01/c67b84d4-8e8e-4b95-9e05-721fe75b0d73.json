As Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland prepare to announce they have returned to profit after being bailed out by the taxpayer in October 2008, the industry faces repeated criticism that it is not lending enough to small business and paying out bonuses that are too big at a time when the economy is spluttering. Kicking off with HSBC today, the UK banks are forecast to make combined profits of about \u00a311bn and contribute as much as \u00a35bn into their bonus pools for payouts at the end of the year. Lloyds and RBS are banned from paying dividends by the EU because of the combined \u00a375bn of taxpayer funds they have received but HSBC, Standard Chartered and Barclays are expected to promise payments to their shareholders. The UK's biggest bank, HBSC, is forecast to make profits of $8.6bn (\u00a35.5bn), up from $8bn a year ago, according to analysts from UBS who also expect the bank to report its highest core tier ratio \u2013 a key measure of financial strength \u2013 for two decades. \"For a deposit-funded bank with little interest rate risk on the books, we regard this as a 'gold standard',\" the UBS analysts said. They indicate that if HSBC keeps accumulating capital in this way it could actually end up holding too much cash. While Barclays had a higher capital cushion than HSBC after the EU's \"stress tests\" on banks last month, concern about the ability of banks to lend and determination to pay bonuses remains. Lord Oakeshott, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, said: \"Every \u00a31m that is paid out in bonuses is eroding banks capital from its prime job which is lending to viable businesses\". As the bank reporting season began the Treasury last night pointed to a series of warnings by City minister Mark Hoban and the Financial Services Authority in recent days to indicate that the banks' results would be scrutinised. Hoban has expressed concerns about the lack of lending and urged banks to restrain pay while last week the City regulator said banks should decide how much money to pour into their annual bonus pots on the basis of the amount of profit being made rather than the amount of the revenue generated, which is the current industry standard. When business secretary Vince Cable published his paper on finance last week he also cautioned banks to be \"very, very self-conscious\" about their pay deals. The bailed-out banks are particularly vulnerable to government warnings on lending to small businesses as they have been set combined targets of nearly \u00a3100bn to the end of next March. RBS is expected to say that it is on course to meet its target to lend \u00a350bn while Lloyds will also be eager to demonstrate that it is channelling funds to small businesses. RBS, which is expected to edge to a \u00a3200m profit in the first half after barely breaking even a year ago, insists that even while loans are being repaid by customers, the criteria for granting loans has not changed. Peter Ibbetson, small business chairman of RBS, said that the bank was continuing to approve every 17 out of 20 applications for a business loan \u2013 the same rate as before the crisis. \"Demand is muted, though,\" said Ibbetson. Demand is down 25% and when loan applications are received, the amounts being asked for are 25% lower too. While the bank had not altered its criteria for granting loans, Ibbetson said that RBS was increasingly scrutinising cash flows and management accounts in a way that might not have been so important in a more vibrant economic climate. RBS has also set up a unit that can help businesses turned away for loans by offering them other support such as invoice finance and will today open a hotline to help new businesses get off the ground. Last year banks which had not been bailed out by the taxpayers set themselves goals to achieve a certain amount of lending and may do so again. The British Bankers' Association said banks were \"well aware of their responsibility to society\". BBA chief executive Angela Knight said the return of profitability should be seen as \"a positive sign\" for the wider economy and added the banks were intending to write to George Osborne to spell out their lending plans. Lloyds is forecast to show a dramatic improvement in its profits, with the City predicting first-half profits of between \u00a3800m to \u00a31bn \u2013 compared with \u00a34bn losses from a year earlier. Analysts also believe that the retail banking units will show larger rises than the investment banking business which is expected to show a fall in profitability. Barclays was one of the first banks to signal that investment banking revenues were slowing when it said that market conditions in May and June had been \"softer\". Even so, its investment banking arm is expected to set aside more than 40% of its revenues to pay out in bonuses at the end of the year. Barclays' dividend is forecast to be 2p against no payment a year ago. Leader comment, page 24"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
