For the third time in as many days, Biden\u2019s appearance at an official event was dominated by the rumours of an imminent decision on his entering the race, leading to three or four times the typical media attendance for a routine business roundtable speech. \u201cI think that anybody who has served this party and this country as long as the vice-president has is entitled to all of the time and space that they need to make this personal decision,\u201d the White House spokesman, Josh Earnest, said when asked about the attention. \u201cWhile he certainly would be adding a lot of things to his plate if he were to decide to mount the presidential campaign, I\u2019m confident that he would make time as necessary for the responsibilities that he currently has as vice-president,\u201d Earnest added when asked if the frenzy would only get worse if Biden does run. The administration points to Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 re-election campaign as an example of where both Biden and the president were able to separate their executive functions from their political activities. But an added complication this time around would be the split loyalties within the White House to Biden and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, who has employed several top Obama staffers to run her campaign. The timing of the vice-president\u2019s decision has become further complicated by Clinton\u2019s scheduled appearance before the Benghazi investigative committee in Congress on Thursday. Rumours of Biden\u2019s \u201cimminent announcement\u201d peaked on Monday when sources told MSNBC that he would decide within 48 hours \u2013 a time frame that could see him either undermining Clinton on the eve of her crucial hearing or appearing to capitalise on any difficulties that she faces by announcing immediately afterwards. But the clock is ticking fast, with a crunch Democratic party dinner taking place in the key caucus state of Iowa this weekend and deadlines for registering as a candidate in several other early primary states looming after that. \u201cThe laws of physics will require that this is a decision that be announced relatively soon, because the date of these contests is coming up,\u201d said Earnest at a White House daily press briefing that was once again dominated by talk of the vice-president\u2019s decision. \u201cThe weather outside can attest that we are now into the fall, and that\u2019s when more of the country\u2019s attention and more of the debate focuses on the \u2013 who the next president might be.\u201d Recent decisions by Clinton to distance herself from key administration policies such as trade would make a Biden campaign an opportunity for the White House to seek continuity for its legacy, but a run by the vice-president also risks accelerating the sense that the current president is entering his lame duck phase, when his legislative power begins to wane. \u201cI\u2019m not going to stand here and assess the vice-president\u2019s body language,\u201d Earnest said, with some irritation, when asked what the situation looked like behind the scenes. \u201cI\u2019m confident that as somebody who\u2019s participated in this process first-hand on a couple of occasions \u2026 he understands the timing pressure that he\u2019s under, but he\u2019ll make a decision when he\u2019s prepared to make it,\u201d he added, insisting the president did not look \u201cagonised\u201d over the decision. Biden himself spoke for more than half an hour later on Monday on the subject of how business can help mitigate climate change, without once alluding to the metaphorical elephant in the room. But it is increasingly hard not to address the issue. \u201cI\u2019ll answer in Korean,\u201d joked the vice-president on Thursday when asked if he was running, during a meeting with the South Korean president. \u201cI can\u2019t hear you,\u201d he claimed when reporters repeated variants of the question three times in scenes that risked upsetting the delicate diplomatic protocol of such events. The day before, the guests learned to address the issue before the vice-president entered the room. Stephen Gardner, an Amtrak executive, quipped that he didn\u2019t think Biden would announce his candidacy during the event, at least."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
