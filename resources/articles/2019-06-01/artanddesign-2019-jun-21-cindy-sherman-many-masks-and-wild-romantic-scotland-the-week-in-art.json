Masterpiece of the week Philip IV of Spain by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez, circa 1656 The ruler of a vast Spanish empire that encompassed the New World seems to be decaying before our eyes in this far from flattering royal portrait. Philip IV is melting. His flesh sags, his eyes droop; even his moustache seems fixed into place by an undertaker for his funeral. His air of immense sadness suggests he knows the mess he\u2019s in. Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown \u2013 and like one of Shakespeare\u2019s tragic kings, Philip seems to sense the futility of it all. Perhaps that\u2019s why he let Vel\u00e1zquez reveal his melancholy condition in this extraordinary masterpiece of disillusion. \u2022 National Gallery, London.
