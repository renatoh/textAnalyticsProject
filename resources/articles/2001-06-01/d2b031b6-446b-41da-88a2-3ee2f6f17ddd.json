PwC blamed most of the \"significant slowdown\" on the knock-on effect from struggling economies in the US, Asia and Europe. \"A further cut in interest rates could be needed later this year if there is any further deterioration in the international economic environment,\" said Rosemary Radcliffe, PwC chief economist. More evidence of the continuing slowdown comes with a report today showing global merger activity has slumped to its lowest level since before the dot.com frenzy began two years ago. Accountancy firm KPMG said that mergers in the first six months of 2001 totalled \u00a3543bn - less than half of the total reached in the first half of last year. \"After intense M&amp;A activity at the beginning of 2000 we have seen a major correction in the market,\" said John Griffith-Jones, head of KPMG's corporate finance division. KPMG suggested that activity was returning to a more \"sustainable\" level. But analysts warned the fall in merger activity could be another sign that the global downturn is far from over. After a string of weak American economic data, the US federal reserve is expected to cut interest rates again this week, and there are growing worries that Germany, the biggest eurozone economy, may be on the brink of recession. Last week, Japan's economic minister, Heizo Takenaka, warned that the world's second biggest economy faces several years of zero growth as it undergoes restructuring. KPMG blamed overheated markets for the rise in British merger activity over the past two years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
