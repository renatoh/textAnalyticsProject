Glatzer, 63, had been diagnosed with ALS \u2013 the neurological condition often referred to as Lou Gehrig\u2019s Disease \u2013 in 2011 but continued to work alongside husband and long-time collaborator Wash Westmoreland, even when he was unable to communicate other than through one finger. The film won rapturous reviews and ensured an all-but-guaranteed victory at this year\u2019s Oscars for Julianne Moore. The influence of Glatzer was credited with informing much of Moore\u2019s depiction of a 50-year-old linguistics professor struggling to cope with a degenerative disease. In an interview in the Guardian published on 5 March, Westmoreland recalled how he and Glatzer watched Moore pick up the prize on TV from a hospital ward. They had hoped to attend the ceremony, but on the day of their tuxedo fitting, Glatzer developed breathing difficulties. While in hospital, he suffered a cardiac arrest and his heart was restarted five times. The pair nonetheless smuggled champagne into the ward, and when Moore won, they cheered so loudly a team of medics came running, thinking there was an emergency. Moore paid tribute to the directors in her acceptance speech, saying: When Richard was diagnosed with ALS, Wash asked him what he wanted to do. Did he want to travel? Did he want to see the world? And he said that he wanted to make movies and that\u2019s what he did. Glatzer and Westmoreland first came to prominence in 2001 with The Fluffer, a well-received drama set in the gay porn industry. In 2006 they followed it with Mexican-American family drama Quincea\u00f1era, which took both the audience award and the grand jury prize at Sundance. A 2011 study of Errol Flynn\u2019s relationship with an underage girl starring Kevin Kline was less warmly greeted, but Still Alice, which premiered at the Toronto film festival in September 2014, was an undoubted career high. Before he started working with his husband, Glatzer, who was born in New York, began his career as a reality TV producer, and directed an indie drama, Grief. Last week, Westmoreland reported that the couple had another script due to start production later this year. \u201cRichard says he is amazed that, at this point in his life, he\u2019s been able to make something that, creatively, he\u2019s so happy with,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
