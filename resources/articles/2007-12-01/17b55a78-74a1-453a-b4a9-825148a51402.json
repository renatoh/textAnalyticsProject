Swedish garage rock band the Hives are inviting fans to submit their own designs for the cover of their new single, We Rule the World. The single, released on February 25, is a collaboration with hip-hop producer Pharrell Williams, which came about after Williams said he wanted to work with the band. \"We went to Miami and had a great time hanging out with Pharrell,\" says Hives guitarist Nicholas Arson. \"He would be busy mixing up a funky beat wearing these big, colourful Liberace-style clothes and honey monster slippers.\" Cover designs - which must be in monochrome - can be emailed to thehivescoverart@googlemail.com before January 21."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
