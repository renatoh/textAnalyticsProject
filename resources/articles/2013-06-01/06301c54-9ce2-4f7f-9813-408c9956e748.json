They have fought the good fight, as theologians say. Still, like every union, this one has its stresses. Why have you agreed to lead on Lord Dear's amendment allowing for a separate register for same-sex marriages, an activist asked Lord Carey. Oh dear, replied the former archbishop. \"I am most grateful to you for alerting me to the significance of the amendment. When I was approached by Lord Dear to lead on this amendment I did not fully perceive the implications of it. So when you contacted me I looked at it carefully and realised that it was mischievous and dangerous.\" Plain speaking and no mistake. He probably learned that at the News of the World. \u2022 But it doesn't seem that he mentioned it to Lord Dear, for on Monday in the Lords, when Labour peer Lord Alli referred to the damnation quote \"mischievous and dangerous\", Lord Dear sought satisfaction. \"I hope that the noble Lord will clear up the point about whether I am being mischievous,\" he demanded of Lord Alli. \"I hope that he will say in the chamber that I am not.\" Sorry, your quarrel isn't with me, Lord Alli told him. It's with your mate Lord Carey. \"It was not I who used those words.\" Lord Dear fell silent. Reflecting perhaps that partners male and female retain the capacity to surprise. \u2022 Deafening silence, meanwhile, from the old guard at the Care Quality Commission as its past performance was taken apart by MPs, critics and John Humphrys on the Today programme. All who were in their pomp when the internal review into maternity deaths at University Hospitals Morecambe Bay was allegedly suppressed were too time-pressed to answer any questions. We are all time poor in different ways. The CQC of old hardly presents as a tight ship, and, as we set about stripping bankers of the honours they once enjoyed, one wonders what might become of Jo Williams, who stepped down as commission chair last year after a four-year term. She was made a dame in 2007. Last year she admitted to MPs that at the CQC she tried to have the whistleblower Kay Sheldon sacked from the board and quietly commissioned a psychiatric assessment of her. And what of Cynthia Bower, who quit as CQC chief executive last year after three years in charge amid concerns that the CQC was \"not fit for purpose\". She received an honorary doctorate from Birmingham University in 2011 for \"outstanding achievements within the NHS\". Seemed a good idea at the time. \u2022 Hard to describe Big Dave the PM as a unifying force on these islands, but he does appear to have united factions separated by years of bitterness and enmity in France. In 2011 the then president Nicolas Sarkozy apparently dismissed his youthful counterpart as an \"obstinate kid\" after Dave's refusal to sign a new EU treaty. Fast forward to the Hollande administration. \"Cameron is behaving like a naughty Eton schoolboy,\" complains a French minister, quoted in the periodical Le Nouvel Observateur. An irritant to French left and right. Perhaps his hauteur brings out the Republican in them. \u2022 Finally, an evolutionary step forward for those who understand that saving the planet can be thirsty work \u2013 bottled \"Iceberg Water\", for \"the health conscious in search of utmost purity\". It's \"clean, pristine and the purest water in the world, created from unspoilt Arctic ice that formed over 12,000 years ago\", the publicists tell us. \"As the ice naturally detaches from the Arctic shelf, it migrates southwards along the Canadian coastline for up to seven years. It is here that Iceberg Water follows local traditions and undertakes a delicate harvesting process to release the water from the icebergs and capture the natural purity within before this pristine gift is lost to the ocean.\" Then they fly it thousands of miles across continents to flog off in frosted bottles. Perfect, just perfect. Twitter: @hugh_muir"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
