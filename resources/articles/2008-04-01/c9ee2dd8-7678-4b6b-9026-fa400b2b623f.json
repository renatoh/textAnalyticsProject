Chinese climbers plan to take the torch to the world's highest peak, on the border between Nepal and Tibet, in the first few days of May. Police and soldiers \"have been given orders to stop any protest on the mountain using whatever means necessary, including use of weapons\", Modraj Dotel said, adding that the use of deadly force was authorised only as a last resort. Associated Press in Kathmandu Two bombs explode in centre of Rangoon Two bombs exploded yesterday in Burma's biggest city, but no casualties were reported. Witnesses said the first blast occurred under a car parked in a central Rangoon street at about 8pm local time. The second took place elsewhere in the city centre about an hour later. There were no claims of responsibility and authorities did not confirm the cause of the blasts. Few people were in the streets at the time. Security and riot police quickly blocked both roads. Terrorism is rare in Burma, which has been under near-continuous military rule since 1962. Associated Press in Rangoon"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
