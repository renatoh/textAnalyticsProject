Not even the announcement from Beckham's advisers that he will refuse any questions has deterred nearly 600 journalists from 25 countries, including the United States, Cambodia and South Africa, flying into the Spanish capital for his unveiling as a Real Madrid player tomorrow. Even his medical examination has been sponsored for a reputed \u00a3250,000 by Sanitas, a private health company whose logo will be prominent as the medical is televised on Madrid's official TV station. Such is worldwide interest that Madrid cannot stage his introductory news conference at their usual media centre and have moved it to the club's 5,000-capacity basketball arena, Raimundo Saporta. By comparison, when Ronaldo signed for Real last summer, having just won the World Cup for Brazil, there was half as many accredited journalists. But such is Beckham mania in Madrid the sports paper Marca has run a daily eight-page pull-out for a week charting every moment of his life, and its main rival, As, splashed with the headline yesterday: \"Beckham Week\". The man himself is scheduled to fly by private jet into Torrejon military airport this morning and be driven across Madrid to a clinic. It is the same route Ronaldo took a year ago when he was pursued at high speed by the media, leading to chaotic scenes which provoked questions in parliament. Unlike Ronaldo, Beckham will not have his medical screened live. Real Madrid TV has exclusive rights but will broadcast it later in case of any unforeseen problem. Provided everything is fine, Madrid's club doctor Alfonso del Corral will givedetails at a press conference shortly afterwards. At 1pm tomorrow, timed for peak viewing in the Far East, Beckham will arrive at the Saporta, protected by what Madrid describe as \"heavy security measures\". He can expect a welcoming speech from the Madrid president Florentino Perez, and the legendary Alfredo Di Stefano will present him with his new shirt which \"may or may not\" have a number but will certainly have his name on the back. Beckham will say a few words, translated into both Spanish and Japanese. Eager to avoid questions about the breakdown of his relationship with Ferguson, his only interview will be with Madrid's website. He will then take the short walk to the club's training pitches where he will perform some keepie-ups for the massed photographers. After that Beckham will be silent. Yet Madrid expect the same media circus for their tour of the Far East, with Beckham due to make his debut against Dragon Team in Beijing on August 2. His first competitive game will be at Real Mallorca in the Spanish equivalent of the Community Shield."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
