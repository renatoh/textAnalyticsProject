Roy Hodgson, the England manager, reacted angrily to Bale\u2019s comments, describing them as \u201cdisrespectful\u201d. Coleman attempted to play down any sense of a row but the Wales coach is clear a player who scored a memorable free-kick in Saturday\u2019s 2-1 victory over Slovakia will relish the chance to show it was not empty talk. Wales take on England in Lens with Hodgson\u2019s side having drawn their opener with Russia on Saturday. \u201cIf you look at the Champions League final, Gareth made a comment in that \u2013 something about Atl\u00e9tico Madrid,\u201d said Coleman. \u201cWhether he said it, or whether he didn\u2019t, he was reported as having said it. But he went in to the final, played really well and scored a goal. \u201cI don\u2019t think Bale has got a problem with backing anything up. I think he looks forward to the great challenges, the big spotlight and the pressure. If he didn\u2019t enjoy it, then he wouldn\u2019t be where he is. He will be relishing this challenge on Thursday.\u201d Of Hodgson\u2019s comment that Bale was being disrespectful, Coleman said: \u201cIf you know Gareth, he is the most down-to-earth boy you could wish to meet. He is not a disrespectful kid. I can understand where Roy was coming from but I think Gareth meant it in a way of \u2018little old Wales\u2019. \u201cI have said myself, for a long time, we have always settled for too little. We have settled for too long for: \u2018We did really well, we nearly got something.\u2019 Or: \u2018We nearly got there.\u2019 And we have settled for that. To go that extra mile, we have got to be a bit different to what has gone before. We have got to want it a bit more. We have got to offer a bit more \u2013 because if you want it, you\u2019ve got to give it. Gareth was simply saying, we are a small nation. We are a tight nation. Little things mean more to us than to the bigger nations. \u201cI understand where Roy is coming from, but Gareth was not being disrespectful.\u201d Coleman will decide over the coming days whether to retain Bale as a striker against England. \u201cI am tempted,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s an option there or put him back in the normal role he plays for us. But I think that we have got between today and Thursday to work on one or two pieces. I was happy with him at the weekend \u2013 more than happy with him. He scored a great free-kick and had a couple of good chances playing in the No9 role. \u201cWe have played him as a No9 before and he never got a kick. We played him against Belgium [in Brussels during qualifying] and we couldn\u2019t get the ball to give to him. So that didn\u2019t work so well. But at the weekend he got his chances and he was effective. So there will be a chat with him and we will look to see if we will keep him there or move him.\u201d Coleman\u2019s only injury concern is Wayne Hennessey, who is nursing the back problem which ruled the Crystal Palace goalkeeper out of the victory over Slovakia. \u201cHe\u2019s improved since Sunday. The next 24 hours will be the important stage whether we can add him to the training group on Wednesday,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cSee if he can come through a training session and be able to participate in the game on Thursday. \u201cThe next 24 hours will be absolutely crucial. He\u2019s got a little tweak in his back, he\u2019s had it before and sometimes these things are better than others. We didn\u2019t need him to rush yesterday and today, been relaxed with him. He\u2019s improved and we hope that will be the case that he can join in a session on Wednesday. If he comes through that, then it\u2019s a green light.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
