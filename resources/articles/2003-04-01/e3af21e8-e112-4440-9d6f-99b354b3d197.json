The desperate state of the airline industry, the freeze on corporate travel budgets, war in Iraq, the Sars virus and increased competition from low-cost carriers have all caused airlines to slash prices. A Ryanair giveaway of a million free seats ends tomorrow at midnight, British Airways is selling 1.5 million long-haul flights at a discount of up to 60 per cent until 15 May, and Easyjet's prices are 10 per cent lower than this time last year. Managing director of the Air Transport Users Council, Simon Evans, said: 'This is the best time to fly ever. Competition has resulted in cheaper fares across the board.' A BA return to Dubai is on offer from \u00a3209 (saving \u00a3132 from the standard fare), Cairo is available for \u00a3179 (saving \u00a3165) and a return to Miami costs \u00a3239 (a 55 per cent saving of \u00a3285). Cheapflights.co.uk has a return to New York with struggling American Airlines for \u00a3179 including taxes for departures between 1 and 15 May. 'The \u00a3200 transatlantic flights usually disappear for Easter but fares have not gone up this year,' said Evans. Kim Winters of Holiday Which? said: 'Americans aren't travelling so transatlantic fares are particularly good at the moment.' Passenger numbers through Heathrow, which has no low-cost carriers, dropped by 8 per cent last month. But buyers should beware - the flipside of desperate airlines offering desperate prices is the risk that some may go bust, potentially leaving the customer out of pocket. United Airlines and Air Canada are under bankruptcy protection, a fate narrowly avoided by American Airlines last week when staff agreed to take a 15.6 per cent pay cut. Cathay Pacific, which has been particularly badly hit by the Sars virus, warned that it may have to ground its entire fleet. With passenger numbers predicted to fall to 20 per cent of normal levels next month, the company warned it is facing its 'gravest threat since the 1991 Gulf War'. Winters warned passengers: 'If a scheduled airline goes to the wall there is no automatic cover for your fare - so book with a credit card or through an Atol-bonded travel company.' And if an airline goes bust the decrease in competition may cause prices to rise. It is the short-haul market that has been completely transformed by the low prices and flexibility offered by no-frills carriers. 'Ryanair showed after 11 September that if the price is keen enough people will fly,' said Winters. No price could be keener than Ryanair's current offer where customers pay just taxes and charges, between \u00a313 and \u00a325, for travel to 48 destinations (including Brussels, Dublin, Stockholm and Venice) from 24 April until 14 June. The effect of such competition on scheduled and charter carriers has been lower prices and an increased number of flights. BA introduced low 'all-year-round' fares last summer, which dropped further last Thursday to \u00a365 for Paris and \u00a389 for Madrid. 'Our year-round lead-ins are the lowest we've ever had,' said a spokeswoman. First Choice is launching daily services in July from Manchester to Malaga, Alicante and Faro from \u00a329 one-way, including meals, with its charter airline Air 2000. 'Passengers are reaping the benefits from an industry trying to maintain cashflow and a customer profile,' said Evans. 'The airlines don't want people to forget about them - so mop up these ridiculously cheap tickets.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
