Everything turns out for the worse both for the kids and the initially flattered Chicanos they play with; there's a certain fascination in seeing Anne Hathaway involved in such goings-on. The movie is intended to be a wake-up call for middle-class parents, but it's pitched at the level of that camp exploitation classic, Reefer Madness. The disappointment is the greater considering Havoc is the work of the great radical documentary director Barbara Kopple (who won an Oscar for Harlan County, U.S.A.) and is scripted by Stephen Gaghan who wrote the screenplays for Traffic and Syriana"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
