Ever since Hedi Slimane's appointment to the venerable post of creative director at Yves Saint Laurent back in March, every signal from the house was that Slimane would remake the mythic label in his own image. First came the news that he was moving the design studio from Paris to his preferred home town of Los Angeles; then the announcement that his collections would go under the name Saint Laurent instead of YSL. Not to mention Slimane's track record of discombobulating the fashion world: this, after all, is the designer whose YSL menswear prompted a then seriously overweight Karl Lagerfeld to lose 90lb in a year, so bewitched was he by Slimane's head-turning ultra-skinny take on tailoring. But in front of the chosen few who filled the bleachers of the Grand Palais on Monday evening, Slimane delivered the one thing no one expected: a reverential, nostalgic homage to 1960s and 1970s Yves Saint Laurent. In retrospect, this was surely always what Slimane planned: when chastised by critics for the name change, he insisted that this was no ego trip but merely a wish to reset the YSL clock to its revolutionary early days. The dial was set firmly to the 1970s. The wide-brimmed hats recalled those worn by Bianca Jagger on her wedding day in 1971; the fulsome sleeves of the blouses the YSL \"peasant\" collections of the mid 1970s. There were plenty of modern references in there too: the stage wear of Florence Welch, the sky-blue vintage dress worn by Kate Moss at her wedding rehearsal dinner, the luxe-groupie chic which informs backstage aesthetics to this day. But where this collection felt lacking was in relevance to the real world of what is worn on the streets of Paris and London. Most women will never wear the clothes on the Paris catwalks \u2013 but if a label is to have potency in the modern world they need to feel that this is what they would wear in an ideal world, not an olden-day one. Unmodified nostalgia does not have the same punch. This Paris fashion week has been dominated by the face-off between YSL and Dior, whose new designer Raf Simons presented his first ready to wear collection three days ago,. The anticipation was heightened by invitations in the form of notebooks embossed with the date and venue of the show on the front cover, filled with blank pages with a monochrome leopardprint background; and by the simple show notes left on each seat, which declared simply: \"Collection I\". Slimane's debut drew a heavyweight audience, including Azzedine Alaia, Diane Von Furstenberg, Vivienne Westwood and Peter Dundas. The audience were guided into a dark black tent buried deep in the Grand Palais and, 27 minutes after the appointed start time, darkness turned to pitch black and the flat black panels of the roof tilted on their hinges to form a shape akin to a church; speakers descended, and the music began to throb. It was a moment which blended the spiritual and the Star Wars to spinetingling effect: even Anna Wintour was noted to smile. Roving spotlights turned to strobe lighting, and then segued to a peaceful twilight as the first outfits emerge. It was an undoubtedly assured womenswear debut from a designer making his first foray beyond menswear. Every flowing dress and sheer cape was immaculately cut. But the show left viewers with a hankering for more of the Slimane-stamped skinny tailoring which dominated the first few exits, and fewer of the dress-and-cape outfits. An industry who arrived at this show preparing to be scandalised at how Slimane ignored the YSL heritage left wishing he had imposed himself just a little more. But this is, as Slimane made clear, only Collection I. And Kate Moss, backstage, pronounced it \"gorge\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
