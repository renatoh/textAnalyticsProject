Let\u2019s end this culture of deference", "bodyText": "A new report by the Sutton Trust and the Social Mobility Commission has found that a tiny cohort of privately educated people, many of whom went to Oxbridge, continue to hold the top jobs in the country. The people holding those top jobs, in politics, the media, the judiciary and business, are five times more likely to have been to private school than the general population. It is not surprising, though it is depressing. I have often lamented the deference that so many of us still seem to feel towards those who embody this well-established pipeline from prep to parliament, who walk the walk and talk the talk of the old aristocratic elite \u2013 Boris Johnson\u2019s continued rise, despite little evidence of talent or integrity, being the most pertinent recent example. There seems to be more than a little bit of Downton-ish forelock-tugging, \u201cthey were good to us up at the big house\u201d, feeling of residual inferiority about it. Why the continued respect where there should be scorn and suspicion for those who buy themselves advantages in life and then coast through, seemingly answerable to no one? Well, I don\u2019t respect it. I\u2019m polite about it, as you can\u2019t blame an individual child for the circumstances of his or her birth whether rich or poor, but I won\u2019t pretend I think any of those privately educated people who dominate Britain are better than you or me (because the chances are you went to state school, too. Most of us did, after all). I\u2019m always going to be more impressed by a kid from a council estate and a struggling comprehensive who gets four As at A-level than I am by someone with the same grades who has been spoon-fed Latin their whole education before being shepherded to repeated Oxbridge interview roleplay sessions. The question is: why aren\u2019t Oxbridge interviewers impressed by this? Oxford and Cambridge are improving their intake, but progress is slow, and despite the laughable fears of some independent schools that their pupils are being discriminated against, not enough is being done. In 2018 the Sutton Trust accused Oxford and Cambridge of being so socially exclusive that they recruited more students from eight top schools than almost 3,000 other UK state schools put together. That\u2019s simply unjustifiable. Furthermore, it\u2019s a plucky state school child that would stride willingly and confidently into such an environment. Yet the off-putting aspects of a group \u2013 whether at university or in the world of work \u2013 dominated by private school pupils is never talked about. Our continued delusion that we live in a meritocracy masks any dissenting view. Could it not be argued that a dominance of private school and Oxbridge workers is likely to block innovation, creativity and vision in many industries? That it perpetuates a sort of parochial, small-c, conservativeness \u2013 a dullness. It\u2019s so boring. People will hire in their own image, and then they all have dinner parties with each other, have the same in-jokes. It\u2019s cliquey and exclusive, overwhelmingly white, rife with nepotism, profoundly uncool and unexciting. The social confidence afforded to the privately educated is always cited but never challenged, despite Hugh Grant forging an entire early acting career from a posh, bumbling inability to talk to women. Is it really acceptable to recruit so many men from single-sex boarding schools who struggle to look women in the eye? (The same problem exists in reverse too, of course, though fewer of these women will be in managerial positions). Any state-educated woman in a top industry will recognise this. At first it\u2019s amusing, then baffling, then infuriating. It undoubtedly halts women\u2019s progress in the workplace. I\u2019ll be attacked for this, as I always am when I write about our revolting, outdated class system. Nevertheless, recruiters need to open their eyes to the potential downsides of candidates who are privately educated, and instead of looking at a woman\u2019s date of birth or a person of colour\u2019s surname and, despite it being illegal, tossing that CV into the wastepaper basket. \u201cOof,\u201d they could say, \u201cwent to Eton. Might be a bit unimaginative, probably not very good at managing teams with women working on them, could be a bit blinkered by privilege.\u201d This is not to say that privately educated Oxbridge graduates are bad people or don\u2019t have anything good to bring to the table \u2013 just that perhaps we need to stop focusing so much on what\u2019s fair and instead look at what\u2019s most interesting and imaginative. I have a friend who worked for an organisation that claimed to be at the cutting edge of culture, philosophy and ideas. They wouldn\u2019t look at a CV unless it had an Oxbridge college on it. I\u2019m sure there were some excellent candidates, but let\u2019s not pretend that anything particularly transgressive or exciting is going to emerge as a result of such hiring policies. Companies and organisations need to be more transparent about their hiring policies. Just as we had a gender pay gap audit, so should we have a class audit. It could take into account multiple factors to account for the full picture of class today. All companies should have to publish the results. They should do more outreach, too, so that students feel that they are wanted, regardless of a disadvantaged, or even normal, background. More mentoring schemes would also be beneficial, more affordable training, too. And, as always, more opportunities outside of London. There are practical steps that can be taken, but the more psychological shift of facing up to the fact that a private school education doesn\u2019t always make a better candidate is something that I fear will take many generations to unpick. \u2022 Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
