Third in the Group One Prix d'Ispahan, Carnival Dancer ran on strongly to record a half-length victory over fellow British raider Naheef. The latter, owned by Godolphin and ridden by Christophe Soumillon, challenged between Victorian Order (third) and Carnival Dancer, only for the winner to prove just that bit stronger. Ridden by Olivier Peslier, Carnival Dancer returned odds of a almost 3-1 on the Pari-Mutuel. Vespone, impressive winner of the Prix Jean Prat, has been supplemented for the Group One Grand Prix de Paris at Longchamp at a cost of 30,000 euros. The late addition of the Nicolas Clement-runner to the mile and a quarter Sunday feature means that a maximum field of 12 will come under orders. Magistretti, Neville Callaghan's Dante Stakes winner, is one of four British acceptors remaining at the probables stage. The others are Illustrator, trained by Sir Michael Stoute, John Gosden's Ikhtyar and Godolphin's Lateen Sails. Provisional jockey plans are Richard Hughes (Illustrator), Frankie Dettori (Lateen Sails) and Christophe Soumillon (Magistretti). Aidan O'Brien's two acceptors are Alberto Giacometti and Spartacus, but the former has been declared for the King Edward VII Stakes at Royal Ascot today. Vespone apart, the remaining doemstic acceptors are Look Honey, Rios, Sign Of The Wolf, Maxwell and Jipapibaquigrafo."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
