As an ordinary parent, I have no coherent theory of childhood. I don't know exactly what stage of personal, social and intellectual development my 10-year-old son should be at. I don't have a detailed moral map that I can pass on to help him navigate the world. I don't even really know what sort of world I am trying to equip him for. I do, however, have a strong feeling that 10 should be a time of flowering. It's the beginning of the end of childhood, a period of intellectual creativity and growth. I can see the signs in my son. He is beginning to understand that the universe doesn't consist of chips, playing football and reruns of the Simpsons. He is beginning to realise that politics can impinge in real ways, and that Doctor Dre is not necessarily the highest form of cultural expression. He may not be quite fluent in the universal language of mathematics, but the growing expressiveness of some of his creative writing is a source of pride and pleasure to both him and his parents. In theory at least, his final year at junior school should be an exciting, fulfilling, broad-ranging, educational adventure. But, of course, it won't be. For my son, and for most 10-year-olds in the country, the next nine months will be the exact opposite: a sterile, narrow and meaningless exercise in drilling and cramming. It's nothing to do with the skills of his teacher, who seems outstanding. Nor do I blame the school. It's called preparing for key stage 2 Sats. My son knows what's coming - he's been alerted by older children to the educational delights of year 6 and it has made him anxious and slightly bolshy. It's not as if he doesn't have enough pressure already. The policy of parental choice turns the move to secondary school into a lottery. He knows that too. It is no great surprise that new research by the Children's Society finds that 58% of young people are worried about exams, and 47% \"often worried about school work\". Stressful regime I've been vaguely aware of the problem since my son started school. I was merely irritated by key stage 1 Sats, at age 7. But now KS2 Sats are upon us, I feel angry that my son is being subjected to such a barren and stressful regime, with no apparent educational benefit. I have discovered that I am not alone. I cannot find one parent who thinks that Sats in general, and key stage 2 Sats in particular, have any value. The parent of a bright but rebellious boy is concerned that his year 6 syllabus is now so limited that he may lose interest and become disruptive. A father fears the damage that a poor result will do to his daughter's already fragile self-esteem. \"My daughter lacks confidence and has always struggled. This seems to be just another opportunity for her to feel bad about herself, with no conceivable benefit to her or anyone else. A mother says her son's school has chosen to follow a Sats-style regime not just in years 2 and 6, but in year 5 as well. \"They were putting so much pressure on him. I felt terrible about it,\" she says. But what do we know, we parents? We focus on what is best for our own kids. Perhaps Sats have benefits for society at large rather than individual children? If they do, the Department for Education and Skills was not able to identify them. When asked to explain their function, a DfES spokesman said: \"National tests are an integral part of effective teaching and learning, helping to identify pupils that need extra support, as well as those with talents that need to be stretched.\" It was a less than inspiring answer. So, in the interests of balance, I asked the press office at the Institute of Education, the country's leading centre for educational theory, to put me in touch with an academic who thinks Sats are generally a good thing. The reply was that no such creature exists, because there is an absolute consensus among academics that Sats have little or no educational value. Gordon Stobart, reader in education at the institute, says the DfES argument just doesn't make sense. \"The children have all got their secondary school decisions by the time the Sats results appear, so they can't possibly affect their outcomes.\" He says the real reason Sats were introduced by the Conservative government in the late 80s was because some schools were failing to teach the basics properly. \"For instance, some schools would only ever teach biology in science, simply because the teachers didn't like chemistry and physics.\" In other words, because some schools were failing, all schools had to be tested. \"They may have had some limited benefits 20 years ago, but there is no doubt in my mind that now they are counter-productive,\" concludes Stobart. What about the practitioners, the teachers themselves? The NUT doesn't bother to conceal its contempt for Sats. \"They are entirely worthless,\" says a spokeswoman. \"They test nothing other than a child's ability to sit this particular test. They have no diagnostic or developmental value. They don't even tell you anything useful about the school. If you want to gauge the individual pupil, teacher assessment is far more accurate, and if you want to measure the school, inspections give a more holistic and accurate picture.\" Teach to the test The real problem is that Sats are no longer simply a dipstick to gauge performance. Under a Labour government anxious to promote them as a currency for parental choice, they have become a major educational objective. The assessment tail is wagging the educational dog. \"They are so prominent that teachers teach to the test rather than providing a broader education,\" says the NUT. Sats now have far more influence over education than they were ever intended to, observes Stobart. \"In many schools, most of year 6 is spent studying three Sats subjects, English, arithmetic and science, rather than the 13 or so subjects that make up a fully rounded curriculum.\" Our country's competitive edge comes not from the abundance of its natural resources but from the ingenuity, creativity and open-ended thinking of its people. But our tick-box approach to education is beginning to stifle creativity, the very thing that makes us successful. A primary school deputy head says: \"The problem is that Sats preparation means good writing is equated in children's minds with the Sats criteria. So you can walk into any school in the country and every child will be able to produce a surprisingly polished story. The trouble is that they are all the same story.\" Even a right-of-centre thinktank such as Politeia, dedicated to considering the role of the state in our lives, has no time for Sats. \"They were supposed to be a way of maintaining minimum standards,\" says its director, Dr Sheila Lawlor. \"But the law of unintended consequences means they have turned into a complete monster. There really is no case for such a heavy-handed state presence in our schools.\" \u00b7 Is your child's year 6 already dominated by Sats? Email us your experiences at education@theguardian.com.
