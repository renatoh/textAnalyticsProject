In a brief but rapturously received speech, the star thanked British music industry executives for backing his career in a thinly veiled reference to his long running battle with former record label Sony. The star, who recently announced that his latest album Patience would be his last commercially released record with future tracks being released free on the internet, also paid tribute to Sir Elton John. \"If this award had been around 10 years ago then Elton would have certainly won it,\" he said. Michael was declared the top of the charts after receiving the most airplay on UK radio. Hits such as Careless Whisper and Faith have given him cross-over appeal on stations ranging from Capital, BBC Radio 2 and easy listening stations Magic or Melody. He beat evergreens such as Sir Elton John or Sir Paul McCartney, both regular chart toppers in music and rich lists. Sir Elton was second in the list, which was compiled by analysing royalty returns from over 600 UK radio stations. Robbie Williams, who was third on the list, was also named as the most played artist of last year, the fifth time he has collected the annual award. \"My top tip for Robbie is to only release one album every six years,\" Michael joked. Michael, who has had a successful solo career as well as a string of No 1s with former band Wham!, said he was surprised to win the award. \"I can't believe it. I've only made six albums in 22 years, so I don't know how this happened. I'm the luckiest writer on earth,\" the singer said as he picked up his award from the Radio Academy for his achievement. Kylie Minogue was fourth, and one of only two women to make the top 10. The other is Madonna at No 6. Bryan Adams is fifth thanks to his hit (Everything I Do) I Do It for You, which topped the charts for a record 16 weeks in 1991. All but three of the featured artists are British. The other acts making up the top 10 are Phil Collins, Sir Cliff Richard, Mick Hucknall's Simply Red and Sir Paul McCartney. The chart was compiled by Phonographic Performance Ltd, which collects royalties from radio stations on behalf of record companies, from all 600 national and local radio stations across the UK. \"This chart is an interesting snapshot of which artists have most shaped popular culture,\" said the Radio Academy director, John Bradford. \"It shows that, despite the emergence of trends such as Brit Pop and dance, it is still the more melodic, established artists who have dominated radio dials.\" THE FULL LIST: 1.
