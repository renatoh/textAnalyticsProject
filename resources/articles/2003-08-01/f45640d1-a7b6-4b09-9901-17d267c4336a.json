A false start - and the world championships in the French capital do not even begin for another three days. The second time around Lord Coe, a double Olympic 1500 metres champion, earned even more votes - rising from 77 to 109 - to become one of 27 council members of the International Association of Athletics Federations. But, if Paris was hoping to win friends and influence people with slick organisation in its bid to be awarded the 2012 Olympics, this was hardly a good start. As the election results were announced during the 44th Congress of the IAAF, howls of derision could be heard in the auditorium at the Carrousel du Louvre. It emerged that 88 of the 199 delegations had had their votes rejected by the electronic machinery and a two-hour delay ensued. \"This is not possible,\" said Lamine Diack, the re-elected IAAF president. Coe, 46, the former Conservative MP for Falmouth and Camborne, was put forward by UK Athletics to become Britain's voice on the governing body after the retirement in March of the IAAF treasurer Robert Stimson. Coe said of the problems: \"I don't think it was a particularly great advert, that's all I would say.\" Of his election he added: \"I'm happy with that, it's a solid vote. It's clearly more than European support.\" Coe, who hopes to become involved in London's bid for the 2012 Olympics, said: \"I'm still discussing a role with Barbara Cassani [who heads the bid] and we had a meeting just over a week ago.\" He hopes his role on the IAAF Council will help promote athletics. \"We have to redouble efforts to get a younger audience,\" he said. \"We have to recognise that a younger audience, whether we like it or not, now looks to different types of entertainment.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
