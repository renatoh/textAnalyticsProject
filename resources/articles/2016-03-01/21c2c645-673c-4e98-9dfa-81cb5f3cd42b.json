Shandling was a standup, host and comedy writer, but his legacy will really be felt in the two sitcoms that he made \u2013 It\u2019s Garry Shandling\u2019s Show and The Larry Sanders Show \u2013 both of which pushed the envelope in terms of the tone and direction that sitcoms can take. It\u2019s Garry Shandling\u2019s Show ran on Showtime and Fox from 1986 to 1990, when both were still nascent forces on TV. They were the only places brave enough to let Shandling experiment with a show where he plays himself, a comedian named Garry Shandling, and often spoke directly to both the studio audience and the audience at home. Though this was a trick employed by George Burns when Shandling was younger, all the characters on the show knew that they were on a sitcom. It\u2019s the sort of meta comedy that now pervades the likes of Community. The first show about nothing was never huge with audiences but was nominated for four Emmys and was a hit both with critics and comedians who used what Shandling was doing and sanded off the edges, creating shows that might have tested very poorly with audiences but became huge mainstream hits, such as Seinfeld. The success of It\u2019s Garry Shandling\u2019s Show and Shandling\u2019s stint as the \u201cpermanent guest host\u201d of The Tonight Show while it was hosted by Johnny Carson set him up perfectly to create his masterpiece, The Larry Sanders Show. This time Shandling was playing the vain and difficult host of a late-night talk show. The HBO sitcom, which ran for six seasons from 1992 to 1998, took viewers backstage to see just how awful and bumbling the people behind the talk show\u2019s velvet curtain can be. While it was never as absurd as 30 Rock, it paved the way for the show about a show. To add that special ingredient, The Larry Sanders Show featured real celebrities playing versions of themselves, something that has since been employed in all sorts of shows such as Entourage, Extras and, of course, Curb Your Enthusiasm. A famous example is when David Duchovny plays a gay version of himself who is obsessed with Larry in the last episode of the series (which, in the It\u2019s Garry Sandling\u2019s Show tradition, is about Larry Sanders\u2019s final episode). The behind-the-scenes footage on The Larry Sanders Show was shot in a documentary style with hand-held cameras, something that would be taken on by everything from The Office to Modern Family. The Office and its ilk also share the tone and pathos that Larry David made acceptable and palatable for modern comedy audiences. Like the bar on It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Larry Sanders\u2019 office was full of awful people lying, cheating and stealing their way to success or, more often, failure \u2013 such as when Larry gets embroiled in a tabloid scandal because his PR rep told him to lie about pushing a woman over in a supermarket. \u201cIt taught me that flawed characters can be compulsive viewing \u2013 seeing them squirm and get their comeuppance,\u201d Ricky Gervais said about the show in 2010. In the same year the Guardian\u2019s Andrew Pulver said, \u201cThis is where it all began. The whole postmodernist, self-reflexive fact-fiction sitcom thing \u2013 loudly claimed by the likes of Alan Partridge, Entourage, Curb Your Enthusiasm and 30 Rock.\u201d Another direct influence was on Hollywood heavyweight Judd Apatow, who worked as a writer and producer on the show and made his directorial debut with the episode Putting the \u2018Gay\u2019 Back in Litigation, in the show\u2019s final season. \u201cOne thing Garry used to say that had a big impact on me was that the show was about people who loved each other but show business got in the way,\u201d Apatow said on the DVD extras for The Larry Sanders Show. He said the difficult schedule and Shandling\u2019s demand for excellence made him better when he made his first show, the cult classic Freaks and Geeks. Though it never had a Game of Thrones-sized audience on HBO, Larry Sanders was the network\u2019s first Emmy bait, receiving 56 nominations over the course of its run and winning three, one for Shandling and Peter Tolan for writing the series finale, one for Todd Holland for directing it and one for Rip Torn, who played the show\u2019s producer, Artie. Even for those who know Shandling only for his appearances in the Iron Man movies making a few cracks at Tony Stark\u2019s expense, the innovations that he pioneered in comedy can still be felt every time we turn on the tube. TV was never the same after him, and it won\u2019t be the same without him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
