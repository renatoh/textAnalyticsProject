Thirteen tries and 95 points inside eight days and 11 successive wins under Eddie Jones are obvious clues but the real clincher is their head coach\u2019s upbeat mood. The Australian guru was almost purring after this tantalising glimpse of his side\u2019s all-court future, clearly buoyed by the increasingly exciting outlook behind the scrum. What, for example, if Jones\u2019s instincts about George Ford are proved correct? After the Bath No10 had produced another smart, perceptive display of game management, Jones was asked how good the 23-year-old could become. \u201cI think he can be better than Beauden Barrett, no doubt about that,\u201d was Jones\u2019s instant reply. \u201cPeople rave about Beauden Barrett but I don\u2019t. I\u2019ll leave it at that.\u201d Even Barrett\u2019s current status as world player of the year does not hugely impress Jones \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t pick the player of the year\u201d \u2013 but the way Ford identifies and creates space clearly does. \u201cI just think he\u2019s got a great feel for the game. He sees opportunities and he\u2019s got a beautiful skill set.\u201d Only Ford\u2019s running game is currently behind Barrett\u2019s in Jones\u2019s eyes. \u201cHe needs to be more of a threat himself. He\u2019s actually too selfless. He needs to be a bit more selfish with the ball at times and he will start to develop that.\u201d Given his team-mate Owen Farrell is equally influential and among the world\u2019s best goalkickers, England are spoilt for choice. \u201cIt was another performance when George looks as if he\u2019s been playing for years,\u201d reflected Ben Youngs, Ford\u2019s half-back partner. \u201cYou have split seconds to make decisions and he makes them look incredibly easy. The exciting thing is there\u2019s way more to come.\u201d Therein lies the true beauty of this nine-try defeat of a powerful but ultimately outclassed Fiji team. Whether it was Ford, Farrell, Jonathan Joseph and Semesa Rokoduguni or Ford, Ben Te\u2019o, Henry Slade and Elliot Daly combining smoothly there was invariably attacking pace and intent, a gourmet twist on the \u2018fish-and-chip\u2019 rugby Jones had promised. It raises the inevitable question of what England\u2019s first-choice backline will be when Anthony Watson, Jack Nowell and Manu Tuilagi are back fit. Jones tends to look less at players as individuals and more at what they do for the collective. Daly\u2019s successful switch to the wing, where he has rarely played, was a good example; he went looking for the ball and has a lovely understanding with Ford from their England age-group days. Blend it all together and there is an emerging England backline which could ultimately flow as freely as the 2001-02 version overseen by Clive Woodward and Brian Ashton when Iain Balshaw and Jason Robinson left vapour trails across Twickenham. Jones wants to see Daly at 15 at some point and the two-try Rokoduguni, if not entirely rock-like defensively, is the sort of explosive finisher any side would covet. Selection for the Argentina game on Saturday, therefore, will be \u201cintriguing\u201d to borrow Jones\u2019s word although, unfortunately for the gifted Alex Goode, it seems the Fiji game did not hugely change his mind. It will be a surprise if Mike Brown does not return at full-back, if only for the aggressive edge Jones loves, while the defensive solidity of Joseph could leave the highly impressive Daly and Rokoduguni fighting over one spot if Jonny May, described by Jones as \u201cready to go\u201d, returns on the left wing. With Slade also throwing one lovely try-creating pass and Te\u2019o adding useful midfield heft, England\u2019s cupboard is better stocked than for years. Up front there is also growing depth, with George Kruis rejoining the squad after missing the South Africa and Fiji games. It is fortunate timing, with Joe Launchbury having been cited on Sunday night for a reckless kick in a ruck early in the first half which caught the Fijian centre Asaeli Tikoirotuma on the head. The laws have been tightened in this area this season and Launchbury, who also scored a brace of tries, faces a ban unless he can convince a disciplinary hearing on Monday afternoonit was an unavoidable accident. Argentina\u2019s Nicolas Sanchez has also been cited for allegedly striking an opponent during his side\u2019s narrow defeat to Scotland. The only longer-term caveat is that several key Englishmen, as well as the assistant coach Steve Borthwick, will be on next summer\u2019s invariably draining Lions tour. Jones is also mindful his England side has yet to experience defeat: \u201cIt\u2019s always fun when you are winning. Our big test is when you lose a game. We\u2019re not frightened of losing \u2026 we know if we do we will learn a lot from it. It\u2019s all part of developing a team. No one wins at 100%. It\u2019s impossible in sport because you are dealing with people. You are going to have days when you are a little bit off, the other mob are a little bit on and you are going to get beaten.\u201d On this evidence that day does not feel imminent, particularly if they can achieve greater scrummaging dominance. \u201cEngland showed what a quality side they are and they\u2019ll cause problems for a lot of teams\u201d predicted Fiji\u2019s John McKee, whose side now face Japan on Sunday. These are uncertain times for Pacific Island 15-a-side rugby, with Samoa also losing to Georgia, but England\u2019s wealth is no longer confined to the Rugby Football Union\u2019s balance sheet.
