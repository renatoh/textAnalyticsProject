There's a 24-hour Tesco on the Newcastle Road, though.\" \"On the Newcastle Road? Is it within walking distance?\" I asked. \"Oh, no, not at all. You could try the hotel next door...\" To be fair, it was barely 5am on a Thursday morning and still pitch black outside. The train attendant had knocked on our cabin door at 4.30am to let us know that the sleeper would be arriving at Carlisle early and we should be ready to alight. Impressed though I was by the train's punctuality, it was well before the scheduled time of 0503 when the Caledonian Sleeper pulled away and headed towards the Scottish border, and I could have done with another hour or two in bed: the service had left Euston only five hours before. Still, I had consoled my partner with the promise of a shower at Carlisle. The Network Rail website said it existed and we were prepared to pay for the privilege. \"Showers? No, there's never been a shower at this station,\" said a greatcoated station staffer apologetically as he headed for his office. One of our fellow passengers had wheeled his bike to the station newsagent and lay down beside it to sleep; a handful of others disappeared into the night. We retreated to a bench on the platform and watched the station clock count out the seconds until 0700, when the nearby hotel would serve us breakfast. Passengers who slumbered all the way to Scotland would have enjoyed a much more satisfactory experience. Showers are available at Edinburgh Waverley, Glasgow Central and Inverness (and at Euston, too, if you travel first class), and the later wake-up call makes an enormous difference to the quality of the journey. And those who need to arrive in time for a breakfast meeting will have no difficulty making it. But the lack of facilities at Carlisle was a pity, particularly since the sleeper itself had exceeded my expectations. Boarding at Euston, which begins at 11pm, has nothing in common with the stresses of airport travel. A train attendant crossed our name off a list and directed us to our cabin. Inside were two bunks. People travelling alone can choose to pay a supplement of \u00a349 each way or pay the first class rate to ensure they travel alone, but are never placed with someone of the opposite sex. (Regular users of the service say they often end up alone, anyway.) Underneath the window was a British Rail-era sink with a cover and above it a small luggage rack. Two sets of padded hangers are provided for clothes. Those travelling with big suitcases will find it a squeeze, but most business travellers will have ample space. It should be added that there is no danger of falling out of the top bunk, thanks to the thick straps suspending it from the ceiling. The sheets are cotton and the blankets tartan: travellers familiar with BA's Club World bed will notice that the sleeper bunks are six inches longer and somewhat wider. First ScotRail also provides towels, a toothbrush and potable water in a neat package. Single-sex toilets are located at the end of the carriage. It took a few minutes for the slow wheeze and snort of the train to lull me to sleep. If you are sharing a cabin and have a poor tolerance of snoring, earplugs are advisable. First class passengers can order food and a Laphroaig or another nightcap to be delivered to their cabin. Anyone else has to make the journey to the dining car. Despite the predominance of oats and shortbread snacks on the menu, there is no rule against eating in bed. Those hoping to recharge their laptop overnight, however, will be disappointed to find there is no power socket like the one Virgin provides in first class. Although the sleeper is popular among some Scottish MPs and MSPs - Charles Kennedy is a fan - First ScotRail has tended to market it as a leisure service rather than an environmentally-sound and unhassled alternative to the plane. Occupancy rates are therefore highest at weekends, when long-distance commuters head home or back to work and holidaymakers are travelling north. \"We have various ticket offers with which we try to encourage people to travel midweek,\" says a spokeswoman for First ScotRail. These include the \"bargain berths\" at \u00a319 each way. There is even talk of a \u00a35 single. Booking complexities Critics point out, however, that the cheap berths are currently only available on one part of the First ScotRail website and the standard fares on another. Neither can be booked via thetrainline.com. The complexities of a sleeper booking - upper and lower berths, and the need to keep male and female strangers apart - are too much for The Trainline's existing software. Indeed, First ScotRail, which is contracted to run the Caledonian Sleeper franchise until 2011, does not even display pictures of the cabins on its website. First ScotRail's spokeswoman added that the company had no power to improve the facilities at Carlisle: \"It would probably fall under Network Rail. It's not something we have any say in.\" It is hard to imagine Network Rail regarding the provision of showers as a priority, given the handful of people alighting there. Yet it would not be beyond the wit of First ScotRail to negotiate a deal with one of the local hotels to offer, if not washing facilities, then at least an armchair in a warm room. Meanwhile, after the ill-advised withdrawal of its first class breakfast service, the company is bringing back the china, silver teapots and cutlery as part of a \u00a31m refurbishment. Although our carriage had not yet been revamped, the standard breakfast bag was remarkably good: muesli soaked in yoghurt in the Swiss style, a muffin and a mini croissant, with orange juice or hot tea or coffee delivered to the bunk a few minutes before arrival. Punctuality is not as good as it might be: even allowing for a delay of up to half an hour, only just under 92% of the Caledonian sleepers reached their destination on time in 2005-06, although this figure rose to 95.4% over the summer. Fares, the bargain berths excepted, are relatively high (an Apex return to Carlisle, Glasgow or Edinburgh is \u00a395, a single \u00a363; last-minute standard fares are \u00a3149 and \u00a3105 respectively; and a first class return will set you back \u00a3205). Regular travellers can buy a 10-journey flexipass for \u00a3885, which is transferable and valid for a year. It guarantees a private first class cabin. Alternatively, the Scottish Executive return costs \u00a3319 and includes first class travel by sleeper in one direction and on GNER in the other. The Caledonian Sleeper's best hope of a revival lies in the increasingly onerous demands of airport security and the possibility of carbon trading for businesses or a \"green\" tax on domestic air travel. Yet the 133-year-old service has much to recommend it. Travellers who are prepared to pay thousands for a flat bed in what amounts to a flying dormitory will find the sleeper cabin offers far more privacy and comfort than a commercial jet can. If only it had taken a little longer to reach Carlisle."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
