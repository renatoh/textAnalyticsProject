In every discipline and at every stage, Team GB have shown the world what we\u2019re made of: determination, dignity and true sportsmanship,\u201d the prime minister said on Friday. May said the government would stage an official victory parade in Manchester later this year, while London mayor Sadiq Khan will organise a parallel celebration on the streets of the capital. No 10 had come under pressure to mark Britain\u2019s record medal haul publicly, amid suggestions that budget constraints meant there would be no official celebration. A Downing Street spokesman said the two events were likely to be held after Britain\u2019s Paralympians return from Rio. The government is keen to keep the Olympic feelgood factor alive as Britain faces the risk of an economic downturn in the wake of the Brexit vote. May said: \u201cThe euphoria of London 2012 didn\u2019t end four years ago, and it doesn\u2019t end now \u2013 we still have the Paralympic Games to look forward to. It will continue on the streets of Britain as we plan a parade in Manchester, alongside the British Olympic and Paralympic associations. It will be a celebration fit for heroes \u2013 and rightly so, because that is exactly what they are.\u201d The prime minister, whose favourite sport is cricket, has been on a walking holiday in Switzerland, but said she had \u201ctaken every opportunity\u201d to watch Team GB\u2019s medal-winning performances. May added that a series of \u201cindividual moments\u201d would remain in the public\u2019s memories, including cyclist Laura Trott\u2019s gold medal-winning rides and the performance of 16-year-old gymnast Amy Tinkler. Team GB stood second in the medals table on Friday night, with 24 golds and 21 silvers, behind only the USA. The record performance has been partly attributed to a decision by former prime minister Sir John Major to use national lottery money to fund sport, and to a ruthless focus on winnable events. But May said the results also \u201cshow just how far talent and hard work can take you\u201d. Khan said: \u201cI am delighted to confirm that there will be an event in London to allow people to celebrate the phenomenal achievements of our Olympians and Paralympians. My team will continue to work with the government and sports chiefs to help develop plans for wonderful celebrations.\u201d Bill Sweeney, chief executive of the British Olympic Association, said: \u201cIt is great that Team GB and Paralympics GB athletes will be celebrated for their achievements.\u201d Andy Burnham MP, Labour\u2019s candidate for mayor of Greater Manchester, said: \u201cThis is the right decision by the government and I am sure it will be widely-welcomed, not just in Greater Manchester, but across the country as a whole.\u201d Earlier this week, pro-Brexit campaign group Leave.EU tweeted a video message that suggested Team GB\u2019s triumphant performance was proof Britain would be able to thrive outside the EU. Medal-winning cyclist Callum Skinner tweeted in response: \u201cThanks [for] the support but I wish you wouldn\u2019t use my image to promote your campaign.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
