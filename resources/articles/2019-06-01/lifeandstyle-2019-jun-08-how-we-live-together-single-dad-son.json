My girlfriend and I had split up and I had been kicked out of school. I was living with my mother, brother and sister on a council estate, and we had no money. I took jobs in a warehouse, a butcher\u2019s, did scaffolding and bricklaying, working from six in the morning till six at night, doing anything I could to buy whatever this baby was going to need. As soon as he was born, I laid him on my bare chest and fell in love. His mum didn\u2019t stay in the picture long, so he came to live with me at my mum\u2019s. I\u2019d wake up at night to feed him. I\u2019d go and see my friends with him strapped to my chest, just enjoying having him with me. I take him with me when I DJ around the world and we have a great time. He\u2019s such a good boy and he wants to pass his exams and go to university. I\u2019m so proud of him. Deaconn, 12 My dad was \u2013 and still is \u2013 a very fun dad. When I was younger, we\u2019d have Nerf gun wars every night. I love going on holiday with him. I\u2019d describe him as perfect, although he can be a bit cheesy. When I was growing up, he made me wear clothes that matched his, which was fine at the time, but I wear my own things now. He\u2019s pretty soft-going, but strict when he needs to be. He\u2019s a very bad cook \u2013 we eat out a lot, which is why I\u2019ve grown to love all different types of food. I wouldn\u2019t mind a home-cooked meal once or twice, though. \u2022 If you have a story to tell about who you live with, fill in this form and tell us a little about your set-up."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
