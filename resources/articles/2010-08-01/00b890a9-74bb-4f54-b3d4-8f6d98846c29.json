We can agonise for hours over the shape, nature, texture, tone and all those other things with which we wish to invest the first 30 words or so. Before often returning to the first thing written. Coupled with a personal introduction, it becomes even trickier. Especially if, like me, you think there is too much \"me\" journalism about. So briefly, as I take up my pen and mouse as the Guardian's third readers' editor, it may help readers to know that my background is as a reporter and news editor, beginning on weekly and evening papers before moving to the nationals \u2013 the last 15 years in the Guardian newsroom and latterly as managing editor. The role I take up has fundamentally remained unchanged since its inception nearly 13 years ago: \"To collect, consider, investigate, respond to, and where appropriate come to a conclusion about readers' comments, concerns, and complaints in a prompt and timely manner, from a position of independence within the paper.\" If the terms of reference haven't changed, the landscape in which they are applied certainly has. The internet has made the biggest difference. Email and the web have wrought a massive change in the scale and nature of the work. In the first year of the readers' editor's existence around 5,000 people contacted the office. Last year that figure rose to 25,000, and it is still growing. Almost none of those contacts come in the form of handwritten or typed letters: some weeks we receive no letters in the post at all. It is all email. The paper \u2013 or should we think of ourselves as a news organisation now? Less resonant but possibly more accurate \u2013 welcomes them, but the numbers put a huge strain on our ability to answer complaints and queries in a \"prompt and timely\" manner. There has always been an element of triage in the way the readers' editor's office handles complaints, but we have to think about what we can do to address the growing number of people who contact us, some of whom are not complaining but curious about our processes. The social and cultural changes brought about by the internet, within the Guardian and without, also mean that the reporters and columnists upon whom we rely for an initial response are busier than ever working across different platforms. Increasingly they are writing for a readership that wants more than just to receive. The work of the readers' editor is often less about establishing whether a particular fact is wrong than trying to be fair and transparent about how the Guardian has come to a decision, for instance, to identify an individual, use a particular photograph or quote someone making an offensive remark. Facts are tricky things too. One person's fact is another person's opinion and a third person's grossly biased and unconscionable world-view. These are often what lie at the heart of readers' concerns, particularly in the big debates on matters such as the environment or the Israel/Palestine conflict. Where we can agree that something is a matter of fact and that it is wrong, we should not repeat it. Too often we do. The biggest challenge is to retain and translate the principles of journalism embodied in the prospectus for the Manchester Guardian in 1821, and built upon in CP Scott's centenary essay, and by every editor since, into a digital age. How we do it is the issue. This newspaper is embarking on a process the editor has termed mutualisation \u2013 working towards a journalism based on a more dynamic equal relationship between those who write and those who read (see his Cudlipp lecture at gu.com/p/2e4a9/tw). As we discuss how to do this we have adopted a set of guidelines based on 10 principles, still under development. It is the tenth that concerns the readers' editor: that [Guardian] journalism is transparent and open to challenge \u2013 including correction, clarification and addition. That's the aim. In which case I should, as the third readers' editor, confess to having been \"nicked\" in this very column by the first while still a reporter, when I wrongly estimated the length of Harley Street in London at a mile. I remonstrated, of course. But he was immovable. Which was, and is, as it should be. reader@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
