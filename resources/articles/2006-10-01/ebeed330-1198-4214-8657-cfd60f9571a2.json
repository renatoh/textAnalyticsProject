This act of deregulation launched a boom in the Square Mile. The self-congratulation has been epic. In newspaper articles, in lectures and in private meetings with cabinet ministers, extremely rich men have reminded us how the Big Bang ushered in 20 glorious years of success. The City is the jewel in Britain's economic crown, they say, creating jobs and fortunes that trickle down to everyone. But, warned the City burghers, government must not be complacent. More deregulation and lower taxes are needed for the engine of wealth to keep running. True, the City is a source of income and innovation, but its success should be placed in a wider context. Globalisation has benefited a vast swath of British businesses. Their entrepreneurial savvy and skills have found new overseas demand. Britain may no longer be big in manufacturing, but it is good at selling its expertise and the services that employ more than 40 per cent of the workforce. British surgeons, scientists, actors, software engineers, inventors, TV producers, architects and writers have all being doing as well as, if not better than, the City. Exports of highly skilled services in post-industrial sectors of the economy - the so-called knowledge services - have trebled to \u00a376bn over the last 10 years. Only China boasts export growth on such a scale. Meanwhile, the City pays extravagant salaries for moderate talent that distort the entire market for executive pay. It stokes ludicrous house prices in the south east. It makes much of its money by takeover and merger, so that British companies are auctioned off for quick profit, with no obvious added value for the UK economy. It is systematically short-termist in its approach to financing new business. None the less, both Labour and the Conservatives compete obsessively to be seen as the City's preferred stewards of economic policy. All businesses like deregulation and lower taxes, but such things are decided in the interests of the country as a whole, not as a favour to one sector, especially one that claims so much but delivers so little for the majority of people living in Britain."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
