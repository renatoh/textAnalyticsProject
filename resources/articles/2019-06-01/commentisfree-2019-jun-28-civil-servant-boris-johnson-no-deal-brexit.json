For years I worked quietly and unsnarkily in a government department under a secretary of state whose name would have stumped your average pub-quizzer back in the good old days before Brexit catapulted the UK\u2019s political meme industry into the big time. Let me recap. In February, I was deployed into Operation Yellowhammer, a sort of temporary \u00a31.5bn sweatshop for civil servants tasked with preparing the country for a no-deal Brexit scenario. Then, at the end of March, we coquettishly flirted with the no-deal iceberg as the prime minister\u2019s deal got rejected for a third time, which nudged the deadline down the road a bit to 12 April. But then \u2013 hurrah! On 10 April, the European council offered the UK a six-month extension to 31 October \u2013 along with a stern admonition from Donald Tusk to \u201cnot waste this time\u201d. Phew! Optimism abounded, and within a few weeks Yellowhammer\u2019s 6,000-strong chain-gang was disbanded, returning most of us to our day jobs. During the definitely-not-wasted months since then, the Tory leadership floating circus has been towing us back toward the no-deal iceberg for another tilt at oblivion. Assuming Boris Johnson is installed as prime minister, his first acts \u2013 before parliament disappears on holiday for six weeks \u2013 will be to shuffle the deckchairs and restart the no-deal preparations process con brio, leaving barely three months to get everything done before we all turn back into pumpkins on Halloween. Will that be enough? The answer is: probably not. According to the Civil Service World take on a recent report by the Institute for Government (IfG), we will never be as well prepared for no deal as we were in March. The task of standing Yellowhammer back up \u2013 sending thousands of worker bees like me back to operational centres to implement no-deal contingency plans \u2013 is formidable. As the IfG\u2019s Joe Owen noted, it will all need to be \u201cresurrected and restaffed, and earlier rounds of staff training will need to be repeated\u201d. The Financial Times, among others, has concluded that this is a sign we\u2019ve already run out of time. I used to be more optimistic. After all, there\u2019ve been some nice tributes paid to the resilience of the UK civil service. Our collective mental health is bearing up surprisingly well, if our diplomats\u2019 claims are to be believed. And, some senior civil servants \u2013 certainly not the rest of us \u2013 have even done rather well out of Brexit. That mojo is evaporating. There\u2019s now speculation that if Johnson becomes prime minister, our current boss, Mark Sedwill, will be defenestrated after clashing with Johnson\u2019s sidekick Gavin Williamson over the Huawei affair. Sedwill\u2019s earlier intervention \u2013 a blistering 14-page dossier on the dire consequences of a no-deal Brexit \u2013 won\u2019t have endeared him to the possible prime minister either (although he now claims the civil service is in \u201cpretty good shape\u201d for no deal). Our former boss Bob Kerslake was more on point when he compared Johnson to an escapologist who\u2019d \u201cput on the straitjacket, padlocked the door and started the tap running\u201d. Civil servants have legal obligations to serve ministers with objectivity and impartiality, as I wrote earlier this year. I stand by that. But the civil service\u2019s technical work relies on facts and evidence \u2013 not force of personality. If, for example, there\u2019s no quantity or quality of analysis that could convince a new prime minister to avoid disaster, then collectively we\u2019ll have normalised fanaticism or \u2013 even worse \u2013 the cynical appeasement or cultivation of it. Either way, having withstood Theresa May\u2019s hostile environment for years, it\u2019s a rotten and destructive place for officials to be at the start of yet another new premiership, with the hardest bit of Brexit still to go and countless other neglected policy areas needing attention. Things can get worse \u2013 just look across the Atlantic. Wasn\u2019t it ever thus for civil servants? Not really. While the recent hardening of the Brexiteers\u2019 macho resolve to secure a no-deal Brexit is frightening, it\u2019s not that surprising. What\u2019s new is the sheer destructive glee with which so many public figures have embraced magical thinking. We now know, thanks to YouGov\u2019s poll of Tory party members, the full horrifying scale of the ruling class\u2019s suspension of disbelief. Brexit must happen even at the cost of significant economic damage, the breakup of the UK or the destruction of the Conservative party itself. As for morale among those tasked with implementing Brexit? I find comfort in movies \u2013 not just as an escape but also as a way of trying to understand Brexit. I\u2019m easily dazzled by the creative sorcery of those highly paid illusionists who can hypnotise and manipulate their audiences to feel any emotion, believe any narrative. And, one day, Hollywood may be able to compete with them. For now, not even Andy Serkis in a Boris-suit could spin that blond mop into box-office gold. The upside of this absurd uncertainty is that if he becomes prime minister, there\u2019s plenty of time for Johnson \u2013 he\u2019s an entertainer first and foremost \u2013 to dramatically reverse his position, grab the headlines and unite parliament\u2019s remainers by cynically recording a charity cover of All I Want For Christmas is EU \u2013 dressed in full Bullingdon top hat, tails and fishnets. Sadly, a bumbling cameo appearance in a heartwarming Waitrose Christmas ad trailing its exciting new line of chlorinated turkeys is more likely. I probably just need to man up, eh? Think positive! Spirit of the Dambusters! After all, Brexit won\u2019t last forever. So you heard it here first. After we\u2019ve sorted Brexit, we must prepare the UK for a glorious, starlit future far outside the stifling oppression of the solar system. Don\u2019t tell us the technology doesn\u2019t exist, empire haters! British ingenuity will rise to the challenge by developing a new generation of splendidly phallic BAE rockets running on fuel heroically distilled from a patented combination of Pimm\u2019s and chutzpah. Let Trump have his piddling Space Force \u2013 I\u2019m ready for Project Yellowrocket. Ad astra per mendacium!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
