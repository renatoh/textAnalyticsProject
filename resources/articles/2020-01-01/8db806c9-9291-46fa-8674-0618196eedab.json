If we\u2019re going to grow the game it\u2019s not ideal.\u201d This is not the first time clashes have drawn the ire of managers, players and clubs. Last May the Premier League was criticised for turning down West Ham\u2019s request to move their home game against Southampton so it would not coincide with the club\u2019s first Women\u2019s FA Cup final at Wembley. Fifa\u2019s decision to allow the Copa Am\u00e9rica and Gold Cup finals to take place on the same day of the Women\u2019s World Cup final prompted questions over the governing body\u2019s commitment to the women\u2019s game. \u201cIf we\u2019re playing Arsenal we want to have a full crowd,\u201d Cushing said. \u201cWe\u2019re probably not going to take as many away fans as we would if the men\u2019s team weren\u2019t playing, so it\u2019s not ideal. I think the problem you\u2019ve got is you\u2019ve got an FA and the Premier League that aren\u2019t the same organisation so I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll ever get that coordination.\u201d Manchester City played back-to-back games against Arsenal in 2016 and Cushing\u2019s strategy will again be the same for both matches. \u201cFor me you do exactly the same thing again and either do what you have done really well in the first game and hope to win again or do everything that you didn\u2019t do in the first game and do it better. I always think you shouldn\u2019t lose twice across those two games really.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
