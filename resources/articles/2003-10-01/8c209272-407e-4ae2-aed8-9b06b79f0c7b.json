Jones always argued that, when the injuries that had blighted his side's early-season form had healed, so too would the wounds inflicted by the experts' barbs. Premiership points have acted as an able dressing and recent performances have forced a reassessment. The First Division play-off winners have picked up five points from their last three outings and this was the second clean sheet of that run, prompting the midfielder Alex Rae to suggest that this could be the foundation for survival. \"I think it's about what we do really and, if we keep clean sheets, we'll always be in with a chance because we do create opportunities,\" said Rae. \"It's not a bad formula. \"If you're not getting battered every week, I think you can take a lot of credit from it and I think that's what we're doing at the moment. We just had to get on a level footing really and get a platform to build on.\" So for the Wolves squad the siege mentality has given way to a quiet confidence. Their Fulham counterparts recognise the sentiment, having also been tipped for relegation but surprising everyone with their start to the season. This was the first time the home side had failed to score in a match this season and, though some might have considered the single point a letdown, their captain Lee Clark found reason to be cheerful. \"Let's not write Wolves off. It's happened to us a lot of times this season where we've gone to places, got the result and [people have said] it's been because the home team haven't performed,\" said Clark. \"But let's give Wolves credit, they deserved the result they got. \"They have got some very good individuals who could maybe get enough points for them to stay up. But we are fairly happy. We haven't played that well but we've got another point on the board.\" It might have been three had Steed Malbranque's late shot not come crashing back off the bar but that would have flattered Fulham, who needed an alert Edwin van der Sar in goal to thwart the lively Henri Camara and Nathan Blake. Wolves have it in them yet. Man of the match: Steed Malbranque (Fulham)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
