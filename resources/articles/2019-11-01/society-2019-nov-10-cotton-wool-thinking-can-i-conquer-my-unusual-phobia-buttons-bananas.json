It\u2019s their little way of acknowledging my odd phobia and that I don\u2019t even like hearing the words cotton wool, let alone coming into contact with the stuff. My heart races, saliva rushes into my mouth, the hairs on my arms and neck stand up, I get goose bumps, my toes curl, my hands become fists. I feel sick at the thought of the very particular way in which it would feel and squeak between my fingers. I\u2019ve learned not to scream in horror, but inside I\u2019m churning. I\u2019ve had this phobia \u2013 bambakomallophobia, to give it its suitably ludicrous official name \u2013 for as long as I can remember. When I was a young boy I wouldn\u2019t have certain cuddly toys because of their similarity to cotton wool (I had a rubber rabbit instead of fluffy ones). At school, my Father Christmas card had a shredded paper beard, and in my paintings, little fluffy clouds made of cotton wool gave way to clear blue skies. I can remember accidentally cutting myself with a penknife when I was about 10 and being more scared that someone would use cotton wool to wipe the cut clean than I was of bleeding heavily. Visits to the dentist or doctor were just as bad, fearing the swabs in my mouth or cotton wool being used after an injection more than needles or drills. I remember one Christmas when my grandmother produced a lovingly made cardboard house wrapped in red cr\u00eape paper in which she had placed our presents \u2013 but it had a cotton-wool roof. Arghh! So began a lifelong pattern of avoidance. When I have an injection now I\u2019ll request cotton gauze and, luckily, the dentist no longer uses cotton-wool swabs. It was relatively easy to avoid cotton wool until my children started arriving. There\u2019s really no avoiding it when you have a baby\u2019s bottom to clean and wipes result in a rash. That was the first time in decades that I\u2019d been able to touch the stuff, and only after my girlfriend had first made the cotton wool wet for me and squished it flat. I have worried that I could pass on this aversion to my children \u2013 we have three, aged 17, 11 and 5 \u2013 but they\u2019re fine with it. Along with pretty much everyone else I\u2019ve met, they find it bizarre and ridiculous and tease me about it \u2013 including my youngest, who rolls her eyes exaggeratedly when I ask her to remove any cotton-wool pads I\u2019ve seen on the floor. I\u2019ve started to think that, at 48, it\u2019s really something I should confront and get treatment for. How can I expect my children to overcome any worries or fears they may have when I\u2019m not willing to overcome mine? I recently chatted to my mother and she told me that when I was two, and my brother was born, I carefully placed all of my soft cuddly toys at the foot of his travel cot the day he arrived home from hospital. I didn\u2019t know that I\u2019d given away my toys \u2013 and certainly not in this way. My parents thought this was a sweet gesture, but I think in hindsight it was probably more out of a dislike of their cotton wool-like textures than any altruism. There I was, in some sense throwing my toys out of my pram just at the moment my brother arrived. According to Cary Cooper, a clinical adviser for the mental health charity Anxiety UK and a professor of organisational psychology and health, my phobia may have had its origins in sibling rivalry. \u201cYour brother\u2019s birth is quite significant,\u201d says Cooper. \u201cIt takes the limelight off you; you\u2019re giving up something soft and the metaphor for that could be cotton wool. When it\u2019s a rare phobia like this one, it\u2019s usually associated with a traumatic event. So your brother\u2019s born, attention is off you, you feel like you have to give your toys up.\u201d Perhaps in later avoiding the soft toys, I was avoiding unpleasant feelings of envy. However, knowing the origins of a phobia doesn\u2019t necessarily make it any easier to address. The fact remains that, 46 years later, the stuff still gives me \u2013 in David Foster Wallace\u2019s memorable phrase \u2013 the howling fantods. I ask Cooper if my phobia is clinically recognised. \u201cYes,\u201d he explains. \u201cA phobia is an irrational fear of an object or a particular situation that elicits an anxiety response, so it could be anything.\u201d It\u2019s not just the understandable, relatable ones, such as spiders or heights; it can be a fear of sponge cake, fresh fruit, knees, even yellow things. In a way, because these are such everyday, benign and faintly amusing objects, this makes them somehow more stressful and certainly more embarrassing. Where do phobias come from? \u201cIn many cases they come from the parents or significant other when you\u2019re a kid \u2013 you pick up their phobia,\u201d says Cooper. \u201cOr it\u2019s an anxiety associated with something.\u201d According to one UK study, 13% of the adult population will develop a phobia at some point. Simple phobias most often develop during childhood, but it\u2019s not known for certain why some people are more susceptible to phobias. Microbiologist Dr Lisa Cross, 42, has a phobia of buttons that started when she was about seven, but she has no idea why. \u201cButtons have always made me feel revulsion. They are disgusting. They make me feel sick,\u201d she says. There is a strict hierarchy to her phobia, too. \u201cA toggle on a duffel coat is fine, the metal ones on jeans are fine, but anything else on a shirt or similar is awful. Worse than that would be one on the floor, not attached to the garment \u2013 even worse if it has a bit of cotton in it.\u201d For this reason, Cross doesn\u2019t wear blouses and all her coats have zips. She will cross to the other side of the street if there\u2019s a button on the pavement. She has managed to hide any extreme reaction from her eight-year-old son, who has not picked up her phobia, and her method of coping is like mine: \u201cAvoid, avoid, avoid.\u201d Cross, who lives in Dorset, says she\u2019s had one attempt at therapy, but she couldn\u2019t go through with it. \u201cI\u2019m hugely embarrassed by my phobia, I just feel ridiculous,\u201d she says. The fact that Steve Jobs had a button phobia too (which explains all those roll-necks) and that he did all right, gives her some solace. Also, she\u2019s survived the worst experience she\u2019s ever likely to have with buttons: stumbling across a Pearly Kings and Queens show in London. \u201cThat was horrific. Why would anyone do that?\u201d Unlike Cross, Rowan Moodie, a media relations manager from Buckinghamshire, remembers exactly when her phobia started. \u201cI was stuck in a lift in India in my early teens,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was very hot and they said, \u2018This has never happened before,\u2019 which was not a great thing to hear. I wanted them to say, \u2018This happens all the time and we\u2019ll fix it!\u2019 That experience cemented my phobia of lifts. I just think I\u2019m going to get stuck in a lift for ever,\u201d she says, \u201cand there\u2019s no way out. Bizarrely, I can go in transparent glass lifts, because people can see me and I\u2019d be OK. I\u2019d be saved.\u201d Moodie admits, \u201cIt can be embarrassing. I\u2019ve been at a tube station and I\u2019ve had to ask London Underground officials to take things down in the lift for me, including a buggy with my children in it, even though it\u2019s only one level. I had an interview once at a place where I really wanted to work and I was unable to get into the lift even to go up a couple of floors.\u201d When it came to the birth of her daughter, five years ago, there was a serious problem. \u201cOn my birth plan I put that \u2018I will refuse to use a lift even if I\u2019m made to.\u2019 But when it came to it, I had to go in a lift to be transported between two wards. I was told that if I didn\u2019t, then I\u2019d be putting my baby at risk, and I was screaming. Looking back, it\u2019s quite amusing that my biggest fear about giving birth was having to go in a lift, but it was an absolute nightmare.\u201d Vix Proctor, 38, is head of marketing for a charity, and someone who has also tried to find the funny side of her phobia despite it being extremely distressing. Over the years, she has had many \u201cbanana dramas\u201d, as she refers to her phobic reaction to the fruit. \u201cOne incident took me two weeks to recover from, after I found a banana slice in a cake,\u201d she says. \u201cI was shivering, the panic attack was so bad. My friend had to kick down the toilet door to get to me, because I\u2019d fainted.\u201d Her friend had bitten into the cake to show her that it was OK, but it turned out there was some banana hiding in it. Proctor, who lives in south London, believes that her phobia probably comes from her grandmother. She didn\u2019t have a phobia of bananas, but she disliked them so much she banned them from her house. Proctor, who is expecting a child this month, started seeing a CBT therapist as soon as she knew she was pregnant, because she doesn\u2019t want to pass on her phobia to her child. \u201cI want to get to the stage where I can have bananas in the house,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think I could ever feed a baby with a banana. Maybe to have one in the house is a realistic target.\u201d Funnily enough, Proctor\u2019s fianc\u00e9 is a bodybuilder. Bananas are part of his regime \u2013 he eats at least two a day \u2013 but they have to be eaten at work because of her strict house rules. Proctor says she is now making progress with her therapy, so one day he may be able to fuel up at home. \u201cI\u2019m very competitive,\u201d she says, \u201cand I want to try to challenge myself as much as I can.\u201d Hearing these stories and reading about the efficacy of CBT for treating phobias, I decided to go along for a short CBT assessment with psychologist Kasia Szymanska, co-author of Understanding CBT: Develop Your Own Toolkit To Reduce Stress and Increase Well-being. Szymanska, who has worked with phobias ranging from a fear of heights to a fear of storms, says that avoiding cotton wool for all these years has simply reinforced the idea it\u2019s to be avoided in the first place. \u201cBy avoiding it, you keep the phobia going.\u201d Her recommended strategy is that I build up exposure to cotton wool and learn to challenge my negative thinking. Szymanska gives me a sheet listing 20 categories of distorted automatic thoughts (unhelpful or problematic thoughts). She has highlighted two areas she thinks I may need to work on most: Catastrophising (where you believe what has happened or will happen will be so awful and unbearable you won\u2019t be able to stand it) and Shoulds (you interpret events in terms of how things should be, rather than focusing on what is). She thinks it could take six to eight sessions of therapy for me to manage my cotton-wool phobia and that I will need to do a lot of work between them to challenge my thinking. She asks me to write down a hierarchy of fears, in which I rate the distress of various situations from 0 to 100 \u2013 eg, seeing a picture of cotton wool (20), watching a video of cotton wool being pulled and squeaking (95!) \u2013 and deal with the lowest-ranking ones first. Over the past few weeks I\u2019ve been trying out a few of her suggestions, the first of which is to switch from referring to CW and to call it what it is. Although this has been met with mock incredulity from my family, it genuinely feels quite liberating to have now broken this particular ingrained habit. Cotton wool, cotton wool, cotton wool! There. I\u2019ve now managed to hold one of my girlfriend\u2019s cosmetic pads between my thumb and index finger \u2013 without moving them, mind \u2013 and pushing on through my usual reaction for 30 seconds. I can see how this slow exposure may work, eventually. I\u2019m really looking forward to my children seeing me start to manage my phobia, to slowly improve, to have \u2013 however belatedly \u2013 faced a problem and overcome it. Perhaps it will have some other, unforeseen effects. Perhaps I will see that all those other uncomfortable things in life we avoid can be addressed, too.
