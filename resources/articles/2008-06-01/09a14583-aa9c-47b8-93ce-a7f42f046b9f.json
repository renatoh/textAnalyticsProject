William Hurt is excellent as investigator Renko, called in after the discovery of three frozen, mutilated corpses; Brian Dennehy's rogue New York cop and Lee Marvin's menacing businessman are the wild cards. Dreamgirls (Bill Condon, 2007) 8pm, Sky Movies Premiere Adapted from a 70s Broadway show, Condon's lavish musical follows a Motown group through the heyday of soul and disco. The energised cast includes Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles as a Diana Ross-type diva, Jennifer Hudson, vying to be leader of their gang, Jamie Foxx a motor-mouthed (it is Detroit) manager and Eddie Murphy as soul man James Early. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (Tobe Hooper, 1974) 1.45am, Film4 The original adventures of Leatherface, the chainsaw-wielding monster in a mask of human skin (based on the Winsconsin serial killer Ed Gein), and much superior to the various remakes and sequels. The film has a notorious reputation but there's little graphic violence; the shocks mostly stem from the power of suggestion."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
