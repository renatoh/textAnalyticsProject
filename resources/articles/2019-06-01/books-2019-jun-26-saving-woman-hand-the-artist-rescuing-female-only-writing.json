Women in medieval Japan were discouraged from studying kanji \u2013 characters modelled on written Chinese which represent individual words \u2013 and began using kana, which transcribe words phonetically. A standardisation programme at the beginning of the 20th century saw 90% of the 550 characters used in kana die out. But these forgotten characters are now being kept alive by the artist and master of Japanese calligraphy Kaoru Akagawa, who became fascinated with them after deciphering letters from her grandmother. \u201cReading my grandmother\u2019s letters was always difficult for me as a teenage girl,\u201d recalls Akagawa. \u201cHer handwriting looked like scribbling, and I used to ask her to write properly.\u201d But years later, during Akagawa\u2019s calligraphy training, she had a revelation while taking a journey along Himekaido, a historic trading route favoured by women travellers. Reading documents written in kana housed in castles and temples, Akagawa says: \u201cI felt as if I were reading a history of my DNA.\u201d Far from being scribbles, she realised, her grandmother had been writing to her using the same script. Akagawa uses the forgotten kana in a style of calligraphy called kana shodo, and also fuses traditional calligraphy with new techniques in a style she\u2019s named kana art, where thousands of minutely painted kana form larger images and paper sculptures. \u201cWhen people talk about Japanese calligraphy, they normally mean kanji shodo,\u201d Akagawa explains, \u201ca style imported from China, practiced by samurais and monks.\u201d Kana shodo uses a script which was known by the 10th century as onnade, or \u201cwoman hand\u201d, she continues, which became \u201cthe backbone of a female-dominated literary culture\u201d. Sei Sh\u014dnagon\u2019s contemporary Murasaki Shikibu wrote her masterpiece The Tale of Genji \u2013 often called the world\u2019s first novel \u2013 using kana, which were often associated with private and emotional life. Men who wanted to reply to love letters sent by noblewomen used kana themselves to reply. And the tradition lasted for hundreds of years; the 19th-century novelist Ichiy\u014d Higuchi used kana script for her sympathetic portrait of the life of a geisha, Nigorie (Troubled Waters). Japan\u2019s government standardised writing in 1900, establishing the system of kanji, hiragana and katakana characters used side-by-side in modern written Japanese. Only 50 of more than 550 kana characters were retained, creating the goj\u016bon (\u201cfifty sounds\u201d) syllabaries used today. By the second world war, knowledge of the older kana had almost vanished. One of the last generation to use the script in daily life was Akagawa\u2019s grandmother, born in 1921: \u201cWhen I told her I was learning kana shodo, she was very pleased.\u201d Women have developed writing systems for their own use all over the world, partly because they have been excluded from education systems designed for men. Perhaps the most extraordinary example is n\u00fcshu, a code-like script understood only by women from Jiangyong county in China\u2019s Hunan province, used to record autobiographies, songs, letters and embroidered poems. While the last woman to learn n\u00fcshu traditionally, Yang Huanyi, died in 2004, efforts by Hunan women and Tsinghua University professor Zhao Liming have resulted in drives to preserve it. In medieval Europe, where Latin dominated literary culture, women were a driving force behind the development of literature in the language of everyday speech. In 12th-century France, the court of Marie de Champagne, daughter of Eleanor of Aquitaine, fizzed with literary activity, with Marie commissioning some of our most enduring versions of Arthurian legends from poet Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes. In 14th-century Britain \u2013 where English, French and Latin were all used to varying degrees \u2013 one version of popular gynaecological handbook The Trotula declared that it was translated into English \u201cbecause women can better read and understand this language than any other\u201d, sparing them the embarrassment of finding a man to translate it. Whether writing Japanese classics, love letters or embroidered messages, women have circumvented official communication channels in creative ways throughout history. As Akagawa remarks, such handwritten texts frequently feel very personal: \u201cI\u2019m always surprised how such a simple action as handwriting can affect audiences\u2019 emotions so deeply.\u201d Kaoru Akagawa will be giving a talk and demonstration of kana shodo at the Institute of English Studies, University of London, on 26 June, 6-7pm.
