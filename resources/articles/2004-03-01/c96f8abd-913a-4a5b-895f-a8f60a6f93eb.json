The controversial gesture, made at a ceremony marking the 28th anniversary Argenitna's last military coup, has provoked sharp dissent within his own Peronist party and sparked a military protest. A poem smuggled out of the death camp, written by victim Ana Maria Ponce, was read during today's ceremony. The young woman, a personal friend of President Kirchner during the 70s, was never seen alive again. She was probably taken to the nearby Aeroparque city airport (the Buenos Aires equivalent of Gatwick airport), from which the secret \"death flights\" carrying ESMA captives took off twice weekly. The victims were injected with a strong tranquilliser and thrown alive into the freezing waters of the South Atlantic Ocean, often with their stomachs slit open to ensure they sank quickly and that their bodies did not wash up on Argentina's beaches, as happened in the early days of the dictatorship. Five provincial governors of the Peronist party declined to attend the ceremony at the ESMA Navy Mechanics School - which was Argentina's \"Auschwitz\" - in the capital, Buenos Aires, where around 5,000 people \"disappeared\" during the late 70s. The Peronists are caught in a sharp debate over whether or not to overturn a series of pardons granted in favour of the leading generals of the dictatorship by previous Peronist president Carlos Menem 15 years ago. Last week, Federal Judge Rodolfo Canicoba Corral declared the pardons to be unconstitutional. The ruling could pave the way for the officers to be tried for atrocities committed during their regime if Congress, which is currently debating the issue, backs the judge's ruling. In an earlier ceremony this morning at the Military College in the Buenos Aires suburb of Palomar, Mr Kirchner oversaw the removal of the portraits of two former generals pardoned by Menem, Jorge Videla and Reynaldo Bignone, who led the last dictatorship. \"No threat, no matter how serious, justifies state terrorism in Argentina or anywhere else in the world,\" Mr Kirchner said. The decision to remove the portraits was not well-received by the military, and four generals and other high-ranking officers resigned in protest. Even today, 21 years since the collapse of the military regime after its defeat by Britain in the 1982 Falklands war, Argentines remain sharply divided over whether the military applied a criminal Nazi-style extermination policy against mostly young and idealistic opponents, or whetherit was engaged in a real \"war\" against Cuban-backed guerrillas who wished to turn Argentina into a communist enclave in South America. \"The president may have opened the box of the past too brusquely, without realising that many social wounds have not yet healed,\" political columnist Eduardo van der Kooy wrote in the leading daily Clarin. Even the exact number of \"disappeared\" remains uncertain, with the official figure being around 11,000 victims. Human rights groups claim that the real total is closer to 30,000. Some 3,600 photographs of ESMA victims adorned the palisade of the 17-hectare military compound today, put up by relatives and the human rights groups who have long been campaigning for the site to be made into a museum. Other alternatives had been considered during the Menem administration in the 90s, such as erecting a monument to national reconciliation that would commemorate both the \"disappeared\" and victims of left-wing terrorism, or even turning over what is prime city real estate for commercial development."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
