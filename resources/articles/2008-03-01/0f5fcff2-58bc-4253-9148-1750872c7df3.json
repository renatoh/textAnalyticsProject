The Metropolitan police said it did not believe it was \"appropriate\" to launch an investigation into Conway, who was suspended from parliament for employing his student sons as researchers at the taxpayers' expense. Sir Ian Blair, the Metropolitan police commissioner, wrote to the standards commissioner three weeks ago to find out whether the matter would be referred to the force. In a statement, Scotland Yard said the Crown Prosecution Service had advised that \"the lack of systems in this case to account for MPs' expenses would severely undermine the viability of any criminal investigation leading to a prosecution\". Parliament's standards watchdog had not urged police to investigate the affair, despite pressure from some MPs. A spokeswoman for John Lyon, the parliamentary commissioner for standards, last month said he had agreed that the matter was best dealt with by the Commons. Conway was suspended from the Commons for 10 days and lost the Tory whip for overpaying his son for \"all but invisible\" research work. He will step down as an MP at the next general election."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
