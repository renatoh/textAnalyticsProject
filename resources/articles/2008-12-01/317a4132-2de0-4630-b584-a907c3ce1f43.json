The first is largely true: that the US-led effort to reconstruct the country after the toppling of the Taliban foundered while attention turned to Iraq, and the consequence was the creation of a space, both physical and ideological, that has permitted the neo-Taliban insurgency to flourish since 2006. The second argument for the latest surge, however, is less convincing. It says that because the surge worked in Iraq \u2013 a questionable claim, despite the drop in violence \u2013 then it will necessarily work in Afghanistan too. The reality is that the two conflicts \u2013 despite the way in which they are so often lazily interchanged \u2013 are not necessarily comparable in military terms. The focus of the surge in Iraq was simply Baghdad and its environs, which represented one of the most dangerous and insecure parts of the country, and the place where the sectarian conflict was strongest. The majority of troops were sent into the capital to support Plan Baghdad, the aim of which was to support the centre in the hope that, by doing so, the rest of the country would follow. Moreover, with a few notable exceptions \u2013 in Falluja, Ramadi and Baquba \u2013 the nature of the conflict in Iraq was a guerrilla war conducted by experienced, committed and battle-tested fighters rather than a constant roadside attrition of bombs and booby traps and snipers. In Afghanistan, those resisting the foreign troops are highly mobile and capable forces, able to call on support of large parts of the population. They are unafraid of violence, or fighting on their home ground, have much higher levels of operational organisation, and hold a more clearly defined ideology backed by their own courts and structures. And in Afghanistan the locus of the war is the reverse of Iraq. Although it has come under increasing threat, and has seen a number of recent high-profile attacks, Kabul, unlike Baghdad, is relatively secure \u2013 at least in comparison with much of the rest of the country. The war is in the countryside \u2013 in the southern provinces that Afghans call 'Big Kandahar'. And while British and other troops have shown that, with the expenditure of considerable effort, they can hold the larger urban centres, the war in Afghanistan is where it has always been over the last three decades \u2013 in the challenging rural terrain of the Taliban's homeland. What the Soviets learned in their long and painful intervention, the US and their allies are slowly learning now: that technology and firepower alone are not sufficient to win in Afghanistan if Afghanistan itself does not want to be mastered. An object lesson \u2013 if it was required \u2013 was provided last week with the virtual severing of the supply lines of US-led forces, a major strategic gain for the Taliban achieved through little cost. But the biggest risk in a surge is that by deploying ever more troops in support of an evasive enemy, the already intolerable number of civilian casualties is pushed up still further, creating an ever more oppositional dynamic between Afghans and foreign troops. And while President-elect Obama has promised to become more engaged in Afghanistan as his inauguration day comes ever closer, it is clear that what is meant is military escalation \u2013 with few words being uttered either in Washington or London about non-military strategies that could bring an end to an increasingly widely spread and costly war. The history of guerrilla warfare, with a few exceptions, is that guerrilla movements can last for years and decades, especially when they believe they are fighting for their own vision of home. And what Afghans know, in particular, is that it is only necessary to survive to win, because history has taught them that all foreign armies will go home in the end."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
