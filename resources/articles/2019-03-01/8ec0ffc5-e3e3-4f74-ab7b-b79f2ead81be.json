But barely 10 days after Valdez was pulled from his car and shot dead, his widow Griselda Triana was targeted for surveillance with spyware which had been purchased by the Mexican government. The internet watchdog group Citizen Lab revealed on Wednesday that Triana received two text messages with deceptive links to software which would have infected her smartphone if downloaded and installed. The day after the murder, similar links were sent to two of her late husband\u2019s colleagues at the newspaper Riodoce, a weekly Valdez co-founded in the Pacific coast state of Sinaloa \u2013 heartland of the eponymously named drug cartel. Previous investigations by Citizen Lab researchers at the University of Toronto have revealed that such spyware was used against Mexican anti-corruption crusaders, journalists investigating the president, and activists pushing for a soda tax. But the revelation that it was also used in an attempt to spy on Triana has triggered a fresh wave of fury over Mexican authorities\u2019 failure to stem violence against the press in the most dangerous country in the hemisphere for media workers. It also reminded Mexicans that previous administrations have appeared to put as much of a priority on monitoring and pressuring journalists and activists as they did on fighting crime. \u201cIt\u2019s shocking and outrageous that there have been attempts to spy on Griselda Triana, a grieving widow, just 10 days after her husband was murdered in cold blood,\u201d said Jan-Albert Hootsen, Mexican representative for the Committee to Protect Journalists. \u201cThese attempts to spy on Griselda occurred several days after Pe\u00f1a Nieto called for an emergency meeting to discuss steps to ostensibly protect Mexican journalists.\u201d Triana is the 25th person in Mexico found to have been targeted with Pegasus spy software, made by Israel-based NSO Group. Citizen Lab said that although it is not possible to determine the exact source of the attacks, its investigation points to a group linked to the Mexican government. \u201cThe cases make it clear that NSO\u2019s technology is abuse-prone,\u201d said John Scott-Railton, senior researcher at the Citizen Lab at the Munk School at the University of Toronto. \u201cIt should be deeply troubling to anyone who is concerned about unaccountable official behavior.\u201d Pe\u00f1a Nieto left office on 30 November with historically low approval ratings amid soaring crime, official corruption and attempts to stifle press criticism. His successor, President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, promised to stop government spying and announced plans to open the government archives. He also promised to respect press freedom, though he publicly chastises coverage he considers unfavourable. A report from the Iteso university in Guadalajara published last week found a coordinated online effort to harass journalists and media outlets who criticise the president. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s spokesman denied the allegations and said people were free to express their opinions. Four journalists have been murdered since L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s inauguration on 1 December."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
