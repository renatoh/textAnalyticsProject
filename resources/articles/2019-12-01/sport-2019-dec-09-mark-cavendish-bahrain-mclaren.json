Bahrain McLaren will take over from the existing Bahrain-Merida team and McLaren announced their ambitious plans to \u201cdisrupt\u201d the world of cycling as they enter the sport. The team is a 50-50 joint venture between the Kingdom of Bahrain and the McLaren Group. \u201cI think from the outset we\u2019re capable of taking them on,\u201d said Ellingworth. \u201cIt\u2019s about getting your key riders on the line in good condition, good health. I think if we\u2019re in that situation, we stand every chance of taking them on. \u201cNext year\u2019s tour, I think it\u2019s a real challenging tour. It\u2019s a different race from what we\u2019ve seen in the past but I do think we\u2019ve got an opportunity. Do I see us as underdogs? I see ourselves as a new thriving team with lots of energy and we\u2019re gonna go for it.\u201d McLaren premiered their new team at the McLaren Thought Leadership Centre and identified their defining trait as bringing fresh innovation to the sport, driven by technology utilised in F1. Bahrain McLaren\u2019s new technical director, Duncan Bradley, said composite technology, data analytics and aerodynamics are areas that will help them stamp their mark on the sport. \u201cTogether we believe that there is a disruptive opportunity for us to take on the might of very, very successful competitors,\u201d Bradley said. Although the joint venture was pitched as \u201ca new era of cycling\u201d, the team includes established names on and off the bike, starting with the longtime Team Ineos coach Ellingworth joining as team manager alongside Bradley as technical director. Bahrain McLaren have invested in Mikel Landas, Wout Poels and Mark Cavendish. They join the sprinters Sonny Colbrelli and Phil Bauhaus plus the Tour de France stage winner Dylan Teuns. \u201cIt\u2019s quite clear the ambition within the team,\u201d said Ellingworth. \u201cWe want to become a grand tour-winning team.\u201d The great unknown is the 30-times Tour de France stage winner Cavendish, who continues his search to rediscover his speed and competitiveness. Such is the 34-year-old\u2019s pull that he was instrumental in the team\u2019s formation. Cavendish has been affiliated with McLaren since 2011 and he initiated contact between McLaren and his former coach Ellingworth, whom he jokingly calls one of the \u201cfew people in the world who upset me: [the other] is my grandmother\u201d. Cavendish has struggled over the past few years after fracturing his shoulder in a bad crash in the 2017 Tour de France and being diagnosed with the Epstein-Barr virus the year after. The sprinter\u2019s career hit a nadir this summer when he was left off the Dimension Data team for the Tour de France and they parted ways later in the year. He seems optimistic that his new team and old bonds will bring the best out of him again. \u201cI\u2019m fortunate to have raced for some of the biggest teams in cycling. You see little things at different teams and you realise: \u2018Ah, that makes them successful.\u2019 When you can come to a relatively new team but a whole new philosophy on a team and you see all of those things in one place, it gets you quite excited.\u201d Just hours before Bahrain McLaren\u2019s official announcement, Team Ineos broke the news that they had signed the time trial world champion, Rohan Dennis, who dramatically walked out on his Bahrain-Merida team midway through the Tour de France in July and has not competed for them since. Bahrain McLaren does not officially form until 1 January but the battles have already begun."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
