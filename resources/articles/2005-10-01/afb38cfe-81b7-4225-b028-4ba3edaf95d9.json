The new measures would see visitors caught vomiting, urinating, wandering around with open beer cans or taking their clothes off in public forced to either pay instant fines or have an even larger fine delivered to their hotel room the next day. Fines of up to \u20ac1,500 (\u00a31,000) are part of a barrage of measures aimed at calming local disquiet about, among other things, the behaviour of drunken foreigners and loutish tourists who wander around the city in swimming trunks and bikinis. \"Visitors arriving in Barcelona will be given leaflets explaining what their rights are, but also what their duties are,\" a city hall spokeswoman explained. Locals are worried that the city has gained a reputation as a party town where anything goes - including wandering half-naked up the famous Ramblas boulevards. \"The Ramblas are not a beach,\" Jordi Clos, president of the hotel owners' association, told La Vanguardia newspaper. \"Dignity and decency are more important than the cash till,\" said the owner of one cocktail bar who recently banned bathing trunks and bare chests. City officials said that, while nudity and public sex would be banned from January, they had decided against trying to control what people wore on the streets. \"Some [beach] areas may be set aside for nudists,\" the spokeswoman said. Street prostitutes and their clients will also be targeted. It was unclear whether the plans include a crackdown on street crime."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
