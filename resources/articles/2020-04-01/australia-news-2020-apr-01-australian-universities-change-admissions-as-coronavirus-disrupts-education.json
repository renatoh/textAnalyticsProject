Year 12 students across the country head into the Easter holidays with little certainty about how assessments will progress if school closures continue into the next term. While some state governments have announced changes to final-year assessments, ministers were unable to agree on the makeup of end-of-year exams at an education council meeting last week. \u201cMinisters agreed that it is important that no senior secondary student is disadvantaged,\u201d the education council said after the meeting. \u201cFuture decisions will ensure equitable outcomes for all senior secondary students as they complete their schooling.\u201d For now, state education ministers say end-of-year exams will proceed. On Wednesday the Victorian education minister, James Merlino, said final-year students \u201cwill complete their studies\u201d. \u201cOur students and their families, teachers and principals are obviously concerned about what the impact of the coronavirus pandemic will be on students who are currently doing their VCE or VCAL,\u201d he said. \u201cOur year 11 and 12 students will receive the care and support they need during this important time in their schooling. \u201cWe are working on a range of options to ensure they supported to do that. This includes a greater focus on online learning, the delaying of deadlines for particular pieces of assessable work [and] the timing of exams, and looking at what other supports we can provide.\u201d Other state education authorities have already begun making changes to requirements for year 12 students. In Queensland the education department announced on Wednesday that it had decided to drop one of the four assessments usually required for final-year students in each subject \u201cto provide some relief for students during this time, and support teachers manage reduced classroom time\u201d. New South Wales announced last week that higher school certificate exams would go ahead but principals would be given more power over the number and weighting of assessments. Some universities have already begun taking steps to change the way they process admissions. On Tuesday night the University of Western Australia \u2013 one of the Group of Eight which makes up Australia\u2019s most prestigious tertiary education providers \u2013 told potential students it was offering two new entrance pathways into its main undergraduate degrees. Beyond the normal Australian tertiary admission rank, UWA said it would also admit students on the basis of a predicted Atar calculated using a student\u2019s year 11 results as well as a special tertiary admissions test. While there are some limits on the degrees offered under the new admissions pathways, UWA said it had made the announcement early to \u201cput your minds at ease during this time of unprecedented uncertainty\u201d. Universities Australia, the peak body for the tertiary sector, said all universities were developing \u201ccontingency plans\u201d in case there was widespread disruption to admissions. \u201cUniversities use a range of criteria as part of their admittance processes,\u201d said UA\u2019s chief executive, Catriona Jackson. \u201cThis unprecedented situation is changing so rapidly that the impacts on both universities and schools six, nine and 12 months from now just aren\u2019t possible to predict. \u201cHowever, universities are nonetheless aware of the potential impact of COVID-19 on school examinations and are developing contingency plans. These will be updated as circumstances change.\u201d Some education experts think decisions like the one made by UWA should be taken across the board. Peter Hutton, one of the conveners of the Future Schools Alliance, has written to state education ministers and started a petition calling for the Atar to be scrapped in 2020. Hutton has long believed that the Atar system is inequitable and fails to properly measure student potential. As a former principal of the Templestowe College in Melbourne, he scrapped year groupings and formed an agreement with Swinburne University which allowed soon-to-graduate students to gain pre-acceptance without having an Atar and study a university subject in their final year of schooling. He says the disruption caused by Covid-19 could be an opportunity to take the pressure off students to gain university admission. \u201cWhat I would like is for the ministers to come out and say to the kids, don\u2019t panic, we\u2019ll sort you out, you aren\u2019t going to miss out on university,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are huge mental health impacts to the current situation and its unfair to put kids through preparing for an exam period that\u2019s going to be called off. They should be saying every young person in 2020 who has the prerequisites \u2013 and they obviously do need some form of pass-fail prerequisites \u2013 can go to university. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair to grade kids given the level and of the disruption and the difference between the haves and have-nots in terms of technological capabilities at home.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
