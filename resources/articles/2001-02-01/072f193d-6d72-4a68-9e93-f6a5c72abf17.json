The league leaders handled the cold, the drifting snow and a determined Hearts side with professional ease and Larsson showed the coolest of finishing touches as he took his goal tally for the season to 35. Celtic were mightily relieved when the pitch was passed fit by the referee as a second late postponement was the last thing they wanted after last week's at St Johnstone, called off due to fog. That had given Rangers the chance to close the gap to six points and the Bhoys kicked off last night under as much pressure as they have been for some time. The conditions had evidently scared off a large number of their fans, who had presumably opted to watch on television, but Celtic were undaunted and took the lead after only four minutes. Alan Thompson fired in a free-kick from the left and Larsson got in ahead of Grant Murray to head emphatically into the bottom corner. But the visitors were dealt a cruel blow in the sixth minute when Joos Valgaeren was carried off with a suspected broken ankle after falling awkwardly when contesting a header with Gordon Durie. Antti Niemi excelled himself for Hearts in the 12th minute after Didier Agathe burst down the right and tried to cut the ball back, the goalkeeper making a telling save as Larsson set himself up for a shot. The pressure was mounting and Niemi again had to come to Hearts' rescue when Chris Sutton got to Thompson's free-kick only for the goalkeeper to thwart him. Celtic continued to press Hearts back after the break and after 60 minutes Sutton was again presented with a glorious chance. Jackie McNamara found the \u00a36m striker on the edge of the box but, once the former Chelsea man had jinked past Stephen Pressley, a block by Murray denied him the chance of getting a shot on target. Hearts were still in the game and after 67 minutes they went close when Colin Cameron's free-kick came off the head of Tommy Boyd and flew past the far post. Celtic, however, killed the game off a minute later when Thompson broke down the left before crossing for Larsson, who flicked the ball past Niemi with the outside of his right foot. The Swede was not finished either and with six minutes remaining he got on the end of Agathe's cross and fired past Niemi before wheeling away in understandable delight. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
