Istanbul-based Hasema has been manufacturing Islamic-style swimwear. For men, these are baggy, mid-calf-length bathing trunks, which, according to Hasema's founder, Mehmet Sahin, 'don't outline one's privates'. For women, they are Spiderman-type bodysuits with tight-fitting bonnets to cover the hair. The Economist, 4-10 March The decibels, the decibels ... In a recent study, researchers found that people who live in noisy areas are far more likely to suffer a heart attack. The risk went up by about 50 per cent in men. For women, the increase was 300 per cent. All it takes to make a difference is prolonged exposure to noise in the 65- to 75-decibel range. Normal conversation is about 60 decibels, so if you have to repeatedly raise your voice to be heard, you're in an unhealthy noise environment.

As the US secretary of the treasury, Morgenthau also proposed stripping Germany of its industrial might and transforming it into an agrarian nation. 'Germany's road to peace,' wrote Morgenthau in 1945, 'leads to the farm. The men and women of the German labour force can best serve themselves by cultivating the soil.'
