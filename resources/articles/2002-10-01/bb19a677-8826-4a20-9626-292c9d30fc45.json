Staid Ercol furniture, the product of three generations of a family-run business, is clustered in awkward groups in the white steel and glass lobby of the company's new headquarters, like embarrassing but still spry elderly relatives at a smart wedding. Ercol has been around for a long time. In the boardroom, next to Ruskin Spear's portrait of founder Lucian Ercolani, is a 1920s poster advertising one of his most successful ranges: Old Colonial Style dining furniture. 'The public has been waiting for this new look; a range of furniture imbued with the glamour and romance of the days when sturdy Englishmen settled across the seas and established a tradition to endure for ever.' But it would be simplistic to see Ercol as looking forward in its choice of architect but backward in its designs. In one sense, nothing could be more endearingly old-fashioned than an architect-designed factory, even one as handsome as Richard Horden's building for Ercol. It's more than 20 years since anyone in Britain built a factory you would make an architectural detour for. That was the flamboyant silicon chip factory in Newport designed by Richard Rogers and greeted with a fanfare as the saviour of the British computer hardware industry - only to fail in a year. It's not that we've stopped caring how factories look. We have simply stopped making things in factories. You could see both the caution of Ercol's product line and the imagination that has gone into its new building as being the product of the company's very particular mindset. Ercol financed the new factory by selling its original building in High Wycombe for housing. It could have taken the money and run, stashing it in a tax haven, laying off its 350 workers, and transferring production to Poland or China. But that's not the way Ercol does things. It has a stubborn commitment to making furniture in Britain and to treating its workforce with respect. That's why it is now trying to do several difficult things at once. Building a factory in Britain when even James Dyson is shifting production to Malaysia is swimming against the tide. Tinkering with the look of the British living room is tougher still. The new factory is one strand in Ercol's strategy to address a changing market. Its traditional customers are ageing. A younger generation of homemakers brought up on Ikea are left cold by most Ercol products. In a tentative way, Ercol is trying to do a Burberry, injecting a contemporary edge to its designs. To this end it is working with Italian designers Antonio Citterio and Vico Magistretti and our own Jasper Morrison and Terence Woodgate. Horden's impressive factory underscores this approach, suggesting Ercol is taking more than a cosmetic interest in contemporary design. Horden is a one-time associate of Norman Foster, but unlike many former Foster employees, who are behind so much of the blond wood and stainless steel that is turning Britain into a branch of Pizza Express, he has a mind of his own. He is responsible for the design of Glasgow's millennium tower, a wing-like blade that rotates gently in the wind, a couple of tautly composed houses and an art gallery. And now the Ercol factory. The layout is simple; two storeys at the front for the offices, and a double height production hall at the back. On one level it follows the pattern established by the Hoover factory in the 1930s on the Great West Road. A bold front, to tell the world how up-to-date, confident and exciting the company is. And a brick shed at the back where men in oily dungarees worked three shifts. But things aren't like that any more. Ercol's workforce share a restaurant that is designed as a pavilion in a forest, and the factory, in shades of white and grey, has the confidence and easy optimism of American modernism from the 1960s. It is planned like a classical temple - long rectangular walls defined by slender steel columns. And Horden has cut back the rectangular form at one end to let the trees come crowding in between the picket line of elegant white painted steel columns, a reprise of Mies van der Rohe's twentieth century tribute to the Doric order. In the long run, if Ercol's commitment to contemporary design can match its interest in architecture, it may just have a future."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
