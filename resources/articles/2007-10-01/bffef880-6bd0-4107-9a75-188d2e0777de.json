France had long convinced themselves that destiny would drive them to the winning line in this tournament but they became the first hosts to lose three World Cup games as Argentina repeated their opening-night victory in resounding fashion. The French Rugby Federation president, Bernard Lapasset, dolefully handed medals to the two sets of players hours after being elected chairman of the International Rugby Board. There had been little to choose between the sides six weeks ago but the Pumas' claws were at their sharpest last night. Argentina turned on the style in the second half, throwing the ball about in Barbarian fashion. It was exhilarating rugby, which made it all the more frustrating that they had spent most of the World Cup driving mauls and hoisting high kicks. Play-off matches have traditionally been forgettable affairs, a prize wanted by no one. That was not the case last night. France were seeking redemption after losing to England in the semi-final. It was their head coach Bernard Laporte's final match, and their captain, Rapha\u00ebl Ibanez, was expected to head into international retirement. Ibanez's Test career came to an inglorious end: sent to the sin-bin at the end of the first half for stamping, he was not to reappear. France were trailing 17-3 at that stage having dominated most of the first 40 minutes. Their only reward for their early pressure was a Jean-Baptiste Elissalde penalty. Argentina defended grimly before Felipe Contepomi, after kicking an equalising penalty, finished off a cleverly crafted move and the prop Omar Hasan was driven over the line after Juan-Martin Hern\u00e1ndez's drop-goal attempt had hit a post. France needed to score first after the restart but the full-back Ignacio Corleto created the Pumas' third try, scored by the wing Federico Arambur\u00fa, and Corleto himself then made it 27-3 after an 80-yard counterattack. France eventually found the tryline through Cl\u00e9ment Poitrenaud. Argentina kept running and interpassing, taking on the hosts at what used to be their own game, and Felipe Contepomi scored their fifth and final try. The Pumas have broken the mould this tournament. Last night, with the pressure off, they showed they could play a bit, too, on their way to a sixth win in seven matches over France. A place in a competitive tournament must surely beckon.
