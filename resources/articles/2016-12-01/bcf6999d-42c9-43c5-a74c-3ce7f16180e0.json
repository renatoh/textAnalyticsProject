But the winner in a unanimous points decision (a boxing career surely isn\u2019t far off) is poor old Jarryd Hayne, who managed to get the words \u201cpornography\u201d, \u201cGold Coast\u201d, \u201cmishap and \u201cschool\u201d into the one headline. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate and all I can say [is] it definitely was not Jarryd\u2019s device,\u201d said a representative for Norton, for whom Hayne was giving a talk on Wi-Fi security to 200 high school kids when some suspicious internet search history information flashed up on the screen. We\u2019re certain it was an educational experience for all. Honourable mention: Jason Taumalolo and Tautau Moga, who were fined $2,500 apiece by the North Queensland Cowboys for egging cars. We\u2019re just glad the club brought an end to the schoolboy hijinks before any innocent party received an atomic wedgie. The Arthur Tunstall award for public oratory Yes, Eddie McGuire has effortlessly scooped this prize again, doubling down on his rank stupidity of previous years by joking that the AFL journalist Caroline Wilson should be held under water and drowned. Turns out that was an image instilled in McGuire as a young boy, when his older brother Frank\u2019s friends used to try to hold him under the water at the local pool. Paging Dr Freud. In the aftermath, The Footy Show\u2019s leery bozy-in-residence Sam Newman fumed at the \u201csecond-tier media\u201d types and \u201cperfumed excrement\u201d always seeking to bring him and his friend down, which perhaps didn\u2019t say much for the emotional resilience of either. Regardless, Newman\u2019s hateful outburst was at least an insight into the thoughts clanging around inside the vast chasm of his mind \u2013 it has been many years since his mood could be read from facial expressions alone. The Coach Taylor perpetual windbreaker for inspirational coaching gestures When Luke Beveridge draped his Jock McHale medal over the shoulders of the injured Bulldogs captain, Bob Murphy, he not only honoured a champion and a long-suffering club, he put his muscular arm around the entire game and told us that we can occasionally put aside petty sniping and give each other a hug. The Mike Jedinak golden microphone for unfortunate gaffes Goes to Harry Redknapp for his unfortunate start to life as a Central Coast Mariners \u201cfootball consultant\u201d, a role that apparently didn\u2019t extend to actually learning the club\u2019s name. When asked the name of his new club, Redknapp replied: \u201cIt\u2019s the South Coast Mariners. I met the owner, he\u2019s a great guy, an English guy. Peter Storrie\u2019s involved and they\u2019ve got an English coach as well. They asked me if I would do a bit as an adviser.\u201d Good work if you can get it. The Jerry Maguire golden globe for terrible pay deals First the AFL lowballed its women players with a startlingly low pay offer, then responded to howls of outrage and met them halfway towards something respectable, though it\u2019s still hard to believe a game swimming such riches can only afford scraps for players putting their bodies on the line and providing lucrative TV content. The wildly popular all-stars encounter aired on primetime TV in 2016 drew more than a million eyeballs for broadcaster Seven, far more than a lot of your average men\u2019s games. But outdoing that stinginess again was the FFA in its ongoing failure to adequately compensate W-League players, who are becoming more susceptible to code switches and strikes by the year. Entire W-League squads are still paid a salary roughly equivalent to that received by the youngest members of A-League men\u2019s teams. Just sort it out. The Robert Groenewegen tankard for post-season revelry Has to go to Tom Liberatore, whose behaviour in the immediate aftermath of the Bulldogs\u2019 grand final win suggested he doesn\u2019t need a lick of booze to come up with truly strange behaviour. The clincher was his club-angering post-season cameo for the Vietnam Swans Australian Rules team in the middle of his end-of-season holiday. \u201cYoung Tom shouldn\u2019t be doing those things,\u201d said the Bulldogs list manager, Jason McCartney, in a moment of controlled understatement. The Frederick Exley gold-plated defibrillator for fan commitment Bulldogs fan Rob McCarthy almost had his own Spike Milligan \u201cI told you I was ill\u201d moment as his side streaked away to a drought-breaking victory in the 2016 AFL grand final. \u201cThey\u2019d wanna have an ambo parked out the front if we get up,\u201d McCarthy said to a fan sitting next to him and, sure enough, in the dying stages of the game he had a heart attack, only to be revived by an off-duty paramedic to the triumphant strains of the club song. McCarthy\u2019s first words upon his resuscitation: \u201cDid the Doggies win?\u201d The Allan McAlister award for comfortable racism This was the year blatant racism went mainstream in all walks of life, of course, and footy was no different from the rest of society. An Adelaide father claimed his daughter had been \u201cdemonised\u201d for throwing a banana at the Crows\u2019 Indigenous star Eddie Betts (an \u201cunambiguous racist act\u201d, countered the AFL), while a Perth mother described the blackface Nic Naitanui costume she painted on her son was a \u201cparenting win\u201d (in a Facebook post later removed), adding: \u201cI grew a set of balls and painted my boy brown and he looked fanfuckingtastic.\u201d Naitanui\u2019s verdict: I don\u2019t think so. Ours: absolutelyfuckingnot. The Lance Armstrong wristband for wins people found hard to enjoy The story of Cronulla\u2019s premiership triumph was either a fitting win for a beleaguered and persecuted group of fans or a bit hard to stomach, depending on your personal allegiances, but there is no denying the joy in its sheer novelty. Paul Gallen got the key to the shire, Scott Morrison looked for the briefest moment like a bloke you\u2019d actually have a beer with, and the fans were left Shark clapping in their sleep after the end of a 50-year drought. All good for the league\u2019s soul, we reckon. The Foxtel shield for completely misunderstanding your core audience Would go to Foxtel for their bungling of the Premier League rights if we were being very lazy, but this time it has to go to FFA, Melbourne Victory and the security contractors who completely alienated active Victory fans and forced many to seek alternative entertainment on weekends. It\u2019s almost like the entirely unique attendance culture was the reason that people actually pumped money into the A-League\u2019s coffers in the first place. The Scott Muller sympathy card for being thrown to the wolves Poor Joe Mennie. He didn\u2019t pick himself, after all, but the South Australian quick timed his run into the Test side both brilliantly \u2013 in that the end of the Rod Marsh selection era put literally anyone in contention \u2013 but also disastrously, in that he should be called up for a debacle like the Hobart Test. Six team changes and many thousand airings of the David Warner OLED TV commercial later and poor Mennie is a fading memory, but they can never take that baggy green cap away from him. The SK Warne pizza voucher for most Shane Warne thing of the year This is obviously a foregone conclusion, but boy weren\u2019t there some beauties in 2016? There was WarnieMojis, the app literally nobody asked for, the Warnie bong, released in honour of 420 Day, and the various travails of the Shane Warne Foundation (with a guest appearance from Waleed Aly), but in a packed field the story that stood out for us was Warne\u2019s calm assertion during his stint on I\u2019m a Celebrity that human beings evolved from \u2026 drum roll \u2026 aliens. \u201cIf we\u2019ve evolved from monkeys, then why haven\u2019t those ones evolved?\u201d Warne asked the dancer Bonnie Lythgoe, a fellow contestant, as they lounged on a riverbank in South Africa\u2019s Kruger national park. \u201cBecause, I\u2019m saying, aliens. We started from aliens.\u201d \u201cLook at those pyramids, Bonnie. You couldn\u2019t do them. You couldn\u2019t pull those ropes, huge bits of brick and make it perfectly symmetrical. Couldn\u2019t do it. So who did it?\u201d Maybe they turned a few monkeys into humans and said, \u2018Yeah, it works.\u2019\u201d The whole episode proved there really are topics of conversation other than leg-spin and pizza toppings with which the cricket great can captivate the nation. Good areas 51, Shano. The Nick D\u2019Arcy commemorative premix can for Olympic transgressions I guess we should be thankful that it was something as tame as ticket tampering that led to threats of the slammer for Australian athletes in Rio and not some Stilnox-infused Games village orgy, but the $47,000 in fines levied on the \u201cNaughty Nine\u201d made headlines for days. The Karmichael Hunt poisoned chalice for falling victim to the Swisse curse Went in spectacular style to the Campbell sisters, Cate and Bronte, who promised the world, delivered relay gold but couldn\u2019t get it done in their individual events after months of pre-loaded Swisse vitamins TV commercials had placed them in David Warner-OLED territory in the minds of a slightly puzzled Australian public. It was older sister Cate who saved the day with a brutally honest post-race interview after bombing out in the final of the women\u2019s 100m freestyle. \u201cThat hurt, not as much as it\u2019s hurting right now,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cI\u2019ve always said that I didn\u2019t need a gold medal to have self-worth and I guess that that\u2019s being put to the test at the moment.\u201d It was heartbreaking. The John McEnroe broken racket for winding up the general public It was another weird and wonderful year for Nick Kyrgios, who played like a dream at times and also did his level best to troll the entire universe at every opportunity. He bailed out of a tournament to play in a celebrity NBA game, had his \u201cNick, you can\u2019t play like that. It\u2019s just not professional\u201d moment, and in between times, actually won tournaments (something his harshest critics tend to ignore). But his most Nick Kyrgios moment was surely his public battle with Australia\u2019s Olympic chef de mission, Kitty Chiller, whose criticisms of Kyrgios and his countryman Bernard Tomic brought a fairly predictable response. \u201cI mean, if you don\u2019t want to pick me or Bernard, you know, there are plenty of others you can pick to represent your country as well,\u201d Kyrgios said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want two of the best players in Australia to represent your country, so be it.\u201d He kind of had a point there."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
