Hamilton was adamant that if F1 is to improve the drivers need to be more involved in composing new regulations for the 2021 season. Hamilton led every lap of the race at Circuit Paul Ricard and was not challenged either by his teammate Valtteri Bottas, who was second, or Ferrari\u2019s Charles Leclerc who was third. Hamilton has now won six of the eight grands prix this season and his Mercedes team remain unbeaten. Mercedes have won the drivers\u2019 and constructors\u2019 championships every year since 2014. \u201cWhen you say \u2018it\u2019s boring\u2019 \u2013 I totally understand it but don\u2019t point the fingers at the drivers because we don\u2019t write the rules,\u201d Hamilton told journalists. \u201cWe should put the pressure on the people that are at the head. I think they are trying but for many, many years they\u2019ve made bad decisions.\u201d Last week the teams met the FIA and F1 to discuss the new regulations in Paris, a meeting Hamilton voluntarily attended to offer his opinions. He has been in F1 since 2007 and driven through a variety of different regulations including a range of tyre and aerodynamic formulae. He was convinced drivers have to be more involved. \u201cDo I have confidence it\u2019s going to shift massively? I have faith it\u2019s going to get better, to the point that I went to Paris last week to get involved. I was in that meeting watching all the bosses of F1 and the FIA and all the teams. I have nothing to gain by it. They\u2019re making all these decisions but never once had a driver\u2019s input in that room so if that can be the decisive point that helps shift it so the fans can get better racing, I\u2019d be proud to be a part of that.\u201d The regulations currently having to be agreed by complex horse trading between the teams, the FIA and F1, with vested interests playing a major part. Hamilton was insistent that fundamental change in the governance of the sport was required. \u201cIt\u2019s really important for people to realise it\u2019s not the driver\u2019s fault,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a constant cycle of F1, for years and years, even before I got here, it\u2019s because of the way Bernie [Ecclestone] had it set up and the decisions that were made then are still the same. Until that management structure changes it will continue to be the same. That\u2019s not my job, it\u2019s my job to do the best I can as a driver.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
