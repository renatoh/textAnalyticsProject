Japan has the answer: a robot house-sitter. Roborior is a watermelon-sized eyeball on wheels which glows purple, blue and orange and is armed with a digital camera, infrared sensors and a videophone. When not on duty, Roborior can function as interior decor. But in its owner's absence, it is a virtual guard dog - detecting break-ins using infrared sensors, calling its master or mistress on their cellular phone, and sending cell phone videos from its digital camera. The robot went on display in half a dozen shops this week to much interest, but since supplies are limited many more shops are having to take orders. \"We've had robots before that were just toys, but the Roborior can actually be put to practical use in the home,\" said Takako Sakataof the department store chain Takashimaya. Takashimaya will sell the machines, developed by Japanese robot maker Tmsuk and Sanyo, for \u00a31,400 each. \"We received a lot of inquiries,\" Ms Sakata said. \"Our initial plan is to sell 2,000.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
