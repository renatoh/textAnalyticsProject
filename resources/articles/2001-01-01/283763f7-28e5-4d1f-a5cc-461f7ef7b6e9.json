That pretty much has modern preoccupations covered. We have come a long way since the days when Freud had to analyse himself for the lack of anyone else brave enough, or qualified enough, to probe the murkiness of his unconscious. At the last count there were 400 different sorts of therapy on offer. Almost 7,000 therapists are registered with one of the two main psychotherapy organisations. In addition, there are countless unregistered therapists, who range from the inspired amateur to the extremely weird. Despite the apparent availability of therapy, and despite the protestations to the contrary from concerned parties, much that is on offer remains the province of the white middle classes. Although a third of general practitioners' surgeries have an in-house counsellor, NHS provision of talking treatments varies, involves long waiting times and is poorly integrated with other mainstream psychiatric services. A national review of psychotherapy services in England conducted by the NHS Executive found that people of black and minority ethnic origin, lesbians and gay men, people with chronic illness and older people were less likely to receive psychotherapy. As a nation we appear conflicted about the role and value of therapy. The British may be unstiffening their upper lips and learning how to express their emotions, we may alternate trips to the gym with visits to Jungian analysts, and be e-shrunk by a cyber therapist on one of the 200 separate websites giving online psychotherapy, and even stay in hotels where an on-call therapist is thrown in with the free sachets of shampoo, yet deep down we remain suspicious. For those of us who might be looking for a therapist it is frankly hard to know where to start. How do we find someone reliable who won't toy with our minds and feelings, and send us home more riddled with angst than when we set out? Do we even need therapy? Or should we simply cut out the booze and spend longer talking to our kids? Does any of it work? The subject of what works is a thorny issue. Very few therapists talk in terms of cure. Very little research has been done, particularly in the field of psychoanalysis, on provable outcomes. Indeed, it has never even been established in scientific terms if the most beneficial aspect is simply the therapeutic value of having the undivided attention of a rapt listener. The very nature of the work, which tends often to be part of an ongoing process, is not something that lends itself well to audit. How, after all, do we measure happiness? However, the research that has been done reveals wide ranging and positive outcomes. Therapy is not simply a tool for the worried well. People with serious mental health problems are being helped by counselling and psychotherapy. The mental health charity Mind says that long-term sufferers of schizophrenia who have recently had talking therapies made available to them say that they wish they had been able to benefit from this form of treatment earlier. The organisation interviewed 500 people who had had experiences as mental health patients, and the vast majority viewed talking therapies as \"confirming and validating\". People with personality difficulties, who have traditionally been considered untreatable by psychiatric services, are responding well to cognitive behavioural therapies. Research into treatments for depression shows that a combination of drugs and therapy is more effective than either on its own. Many people suffering from disabling compulsions and fears have had their lives transformed in a relatively short time by the skilful intervention of therapists. For those who have been led to a greater understanding of their deepest motivations and behaviours, for those who have been helped to work and love more effectively, therapy is irreplaceable. What follows is a guide to the talking therapies. It is not definitive and, although I have divided various sorts of therapy into sections, there is a great deal of overlap between them all. There is no therapy that has been proved definitively to be better than another. Research shows that it is not, in the end, the theoretical background of the therapist that is the most important factor in successful therapy, but rather the fit between the therapist and client. In seeking out a therapist, it is advisable, in the first instance, to consult your GP, who will know what is available in your area. If you are looking independently, the relevant organisations (see contacts panel on page 24) provide lists of registered, and therefore accredited therapists. Word of mouth is useful though not infallible: the relationship between a therapist and patient is a very personal one. It is also useful, at this stage, to ask of yourself what particular problem you are seeking to address, how much time and money you want to invest in the treatment and how active a role you want to take yourself. If you have experienced a crisis of some kind, it may well be that counselling, or a brief therapy, would suit you best. If, however, you feel your problems are more historical and less specific, then psychotherapy might be the most helpful approach. If one particular therapist does not suit, find another. All sorts of therapies are available through the NHS, but it is very hit and miss, and even if you strike lucky, you are unlikely to be offered any long-term therapy. In private treatment, \u00a330 to \u00a350 is the approximate range for an analytical hour (which actually only lasts 50 minutes), with therapists with more experience generally charging the most. Cognitive and systemic work can cost anywhere between \u00a325 to \u00a3130, but these often require far fewer sessions. Almost all therapists operate a sliding scale, and the umbrella organisations should be able to help you to find a therapist who will offer a reduced fee. Psychotherapy Psychoanalysis and Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy Psychoanalysis is psychotherapy in its purest form. It is the psychotherapy that Freud devised and has formed the basis for numerous other therapies. Freud's thesis was that much of our mental activity is unconscious, and he believed that emotional disorders are caused by repressed traumatic memories of childhood. His work was to try and help patients recognise and then reconcile these hitherto hidden or forgotten aspects of their psyche into their conscious life. Since psychoanalysis proper demands at least two years of lying on a couch five times a week, as a treatment it is unsuitable for all but the very keen, or those who are training to enter the profession (most psychotherapists will have themselves undergone at least five years of therapy). Psychoanalytic psychotherapy is derived from psychoanalysis, but is less of a financial and time commitment. The purists (mainly the practitioners) claim that psychoanalysis is the Rolls-Royce of treatments, but most other therapists in the field say that such an in-depth analysis is not necessary. Psychoanalytic psychotherapy requires one to three sessions a week, and though the couch is still used, sometimes the patient can sit facing the therapist. Traditionally, the therapist tells the patient very little about themselves. The idea of presenting a blank screen is intended to enable the patient to use the therapist to experience or re-experience other past or present relationships in the relationship with the therapist. This is what is known as transference. The therapist says very little and encourages the patient to free associate: to say what first comes into their heads and thereby enable the therapist to build a picture of what is being communicated emotionally. In this way, the therapist aims to ultimately identify conflicts and inhibitions. The use of the couch and consequent lack of eye contact is said to speed up the process of reaching the more profound parts of the mind. The aim of psychoanalytic psychotherapy is not so much to produce happiness or fulfilment but to help subjects recognise the obstacles that are preventing them from being the people they want to be. It helps to think of the treatment as not trying simply to address the fact that a person cannot bear falling leaves, but the reason why they cannot bear falling leaves. Quite often a recent crisis or emotional experience might be the propulsion for seeing a therapist, but the ideal candidate for this sort of work would be someone who feels that their problems are more global and less specific. Some degree of interest in the workings of the mind and a facility for expression, though not essential, is often considered necessary for those undergoing psychoanalysis. People must be prepared for frustration and a lot of hard, often painful graft. Analytical psychology This school derives from the work of CG Jung. Analytical psychology and psychoanalysis come from the same source, in that they both deal with a psychodynamic way of thinking, but there are major theoretical differences, most notably in the interpretation of the unconscious and in Jung's emphasis on the connection between psyche and body. Jung and Freud fell out mainly because the former believed that Freud's theory of early traumatic experience as the cause of neurosis was too deterministic. Although analytical therapy still operates by bringing unconscious motivations and feelings to the conscious, it also addresses what is sometimes called the \"collective unconscious\". This is based on the idea that we, as individuals, not only have a personal history, but also share a common biological and social history. Jung felt that not only did the unconscious contain elements of repressed emotions and experiences, but that it also could contain positive things, or even things that have not yet happened. Broadly, the Jungian approach involves more active participation from the therapist. The aim is to explore the potential of an individual. The therapist strives to look not only at the person that has come into analysis, but at the person they might become in the future, and believes that we are all capable of taking charge of our own lives. Transference is used by most therapists in the field, although Jung himself felt it was a nuisance. Some of the work involves looking at the dreams of patients together with using images and drawings to access the unconscious. This therapy would suit people who either have specific problems, or who want an in-depth analysis to help them to enrich their lives or to better understand themselves. It might be useful for those who have a sense that their lives have become unbalanced, with work or the search for a successful relationship predominating at the expense of other areas. Since the emphasis is on self-fulfilment, it is perhaps of particular interest to older people, or people who have problems expressing their creativity. Family, couple, sexual and systematic therapy The focus of the therapies within this group is on intimate relationships rather than on the individual. Therapists work with whole families, parts of families or extended families. The theoretical basis tends to be systemic, ie, to view people in relation to each other. It explores not only how people communicate together, but what they communicate, aiming to identify and explore the patterns of belief and behaviours in roles and relationships (including sexual relationships) that seem to have become set over time, and to enable people to decide where change would be desirable. Systemic practitioners tend to take an active, questioning approach, which can be fairly problem focused, and the therapy is therefore usually relatively short-term. A single session can be helpful in unblocking the way people react together. Since the aim is to get groups of people or couples to work together, sessions with a therapist often act as a catalyst for change, taking place at two or three weekly intervals to enable those involved to take the work into their own lives rather than keeping it in the therapy room. Some sexual therapists use the systemic approach, but others work psychodynamically to explore current sexual problems in relation to past unresolved, and maybe unconscious, impulses and blockages. Experiential constructivist therapies Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) This therapy is based on the principle that we all carry within us a map of how we think the world works. Neuro-linguists believe that we are trying to ascribe patterns and shape meanings from the moment we are born. This sometimes results in fixed patterns of behaviour. The therapy seeks to understand an emotional state in its most basic form before it has become layered by sometimes unhelpful practice. The therapist seeks to counter the statement that a patient might make, that they know what will happen, with the question: when did you not know that? It tends to be a practical, directive approach. The client and therapist engage in a dialogue, with most of the work accomplished in five to eight sessions. The aim is to give clients the ability to look at their own beliefs and behaviours, to sometimes accept limitations and boundaries, but ultimately reach desired goals, or at least new versions of those goals. It is likely to benefit people who perhaps have a sense that the world is directing them and they are powerless. It may be helpful for stress-related problems, or for people who feel that they are bottling things up. NLP is also considered helpful with professional coaching. Existential Therapy The existential approach is rooted in philosophical ideas. It has at its basis the desire to search for truth rather than fitting the client into pre-established frameworks of interpretation. Unlike some other therapies, which claim that there is a healthy and an unhealthy way of thinking and living, the existential position is that we all have to find out our own unique way of being. It is much less theory-driven than, say, psychoanalysis, and is more akin to NLP in that it stresses the importance of the individual. Existentialists do not draw on scientific views nor use concepts of the unconscious to explain behaviour, but focus more on how we avoid taking responsibility for who we are. They strive to try and make the individual aware that they are making choices on a day-to-day basis and that it might be more useful if these choices are made clearly and not brushed over. Existentialists believe that although human beings are connected to each other, they are fundamentally alone. This aloneness gives humans a sort of freedom, because it enables them to imagine and create themselves in any way that they wish. The work tends not to focus on one problem, but to look at the person as a whole, as someone who is in a constant state of becoming. Generally, the therapy takes a long time, but since existentialists avoid naming goals, the length of therapy depends very much on the individual. It would appeal more to people who want to have a deeper look at their lives or review where they are in the world, and who prefer to think for themselves rather than be told what is wrong with them. It may be suitable for people who feel that they are outsiders or who are facing a crisis or a change of direction. Hypno-Psychotherapy This therapy has struggled for validation against charges that it is not a real psychotherapy. Also it has had trouble casting off its image as a tool used by stage hypnotists to make unsuspecting members of the public perform humiliating acts. Hypnosis has been practised for centuries in some form or other. Freud himself used it as a technique to access the unconscious. Present-day hypno-psychotherapy understands that we have a learned model of the world that can restrict the way we feel, what we understand, our attitudes and behaviour. Hypnosis is a state of relaxation that people enter voluntarily, during which there occurs an altered state of conscious awareness. Contrary to popular belief, the person undergoing hypnosis is conscious throughout the process. During hypnosis the therapist can intervene to draw the individual's attention to new possibilities, to alternative patterns of thought, emotions and behaviour. The work is tailored to an individual's needs. Nothing is suggested under hypnosis that has not been agreed before in discussion. The cognitive motivations are examined in detail with the client in order to formulate the \"script\" used by practitioners to induce hypnosis and suggest change. Disclosure techniques such as \"regression\" are sometimes used to address more deep-seated problems. The length of treatment is also directed by the client. This therapy appears particularly useful for dealing with problems in the here and now. Much of its success is dependent on an individual's willingness to participate in the process. Some therapists specialise in particular areas. It is suitable for people with addictions such as smoking and alcohol, stress, anxiety, depression, fears, phobias, pain relief, weight loss, post-traumatic stress disorder and insomnia. Clinical psychology Cognitive Behavioural Therapy Purely behavioural treatments focus on overt behaviour and the environment, rather than the subjective experiences or internal forces that are assumed to underlie the problem. Individuals are taught to face the situations that lead to anxiety and learn to deal with them. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) developed partly out of a dissatisfaction with the limitations of behavioural therapy, and partly a dissatisfaction with traditional psychotherapies of the analytical type. Its aim is to try and change both a person's cognitions (mental processes, perceptions and assumptions) and their behaviour. Disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) are sustained by a vicious circle. The behaviour itself (excessive hand washing, for instance) seems to relieve anxiety which, in turn, reinforces the original belief. The principle is that people who are anxious or depressed have different cognitions from people who are happy and confident. The real difference between people who are confident and anxious isn't that one group is having all the good luck, and the others aren't, it is how they perceive their own reality and the way they make sense of what is happening to them. The cognitive approach seeks to help clients identify and then modify those thoughts that are leading to maladaptive behaviours. It is a collaborative process that involves client and therapist working together on routes to take that feel safe and manageable. Together they seek to uncover the interpretations and evaluations that might be contributing to a client's distortion of the world. You may feel you are dying, but what is the evidence? The therapist teaches the client to recognise negative automatic thoughts, look for alternatives and to utilise the \"what if\" technique (for example, What if you did miss the train? What would be the worst thing that could happen?). Because this is, in a sense, a results-based discipline, there has been more research carried out on its effectiveness, and results on the whole are positive - anxiety states take 12 to 16 weeks to address, but due to its popularity, resources are stretched. It is available on the NHS by clinical psychologists and a growing number of specially trained nurses. It is most useful for people who feel that they have something that is making their life difficult and that is preventing them from functioning normally, for example various anxiety problems such as OCD, panic disorders, depression, relationship problems and compulsive behaviour. Because of the collaborative nature of the therapy, those undergoing CBT should be willing to participate actively and be prepared to carry out home-work assignments. Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy Generally considered to be less collaborative and more directive than CBT, rational emotive behaviour therapy (REBT) was established in 1955 by Albert Ellis. The basic premise is that human beings have two basic biological drives: a tendency towards irrationality; and the potential to change. Therapists believe that people perpetuate their psychological disturbance because of their own theories concerning the cause of their problems. They tend to attribute the cause of their problems to situations rather than to their beliefs about these situations. Because they are unaware of this, they continually reindoctrinate themselves with these beliefs. Practitioners have also identified a reluctance to address change on the part of patients as being due to their unwillingness to move out of their comfort zone, and also a tendency to be anxious about their own anxiety. The goals of therapy are to help people to make profound philosophical changes that would involve them giving up their irrational demands on themselves and others, accepting themselves unconditionally and increasing their tolerance for frustration. The therapy can be offered on a longer- or shorter-term basis and is best suited to treating specific problems that can be identified and articulated. Humanistic &amp; integrative psychotherapy The premise of the humanistic outlook is that people must be understood in the context of their own unique experience. There is no single, clear theoretical focus, but a reliance on a connected network of ideas. Therapists believe that psychology alone cannot define what makes a person uniquely human, and that we have to draw from many other fields outside psychology and medicine in order to understand the human condition. It encourages individuals to find the potential for change within themselves. A major difference between the humanistic therapies and psychoanalysis is that any assessment of the client using standard tools is seen to go against the therapeutic relationship. The interaction of therapist and client is viewed as a dialogue, exploring what happened in the past and expressing emotions that have been held in the body since that time. The goal is to help the patient transfer the gains they have made through an increased awareness into everyday life. It is essentially an optimistic type of therapy concerned with human potential. Gestalt Therapy Gestalt was first developed as a therapy by Fritz and Laura Perls in the 50s and is now one of the main humanistic therapies. It focuses on developing authentic relations in the present, respect for the individual details of each person's experience (phenomenology) and a range of expressive techniques (including imagery and enactment). Gestaltists believe that we are wired as human beings to make sense of the world and to create a wholeness or a complete picture of experience and feelings. They say that before the age of seven we develop ways of acting (or fixed gestalts), which at the time may have been adequate coping mechanisms but have now become inefficient. The therapist doesn't analyse the patient, but rather helps the patient to highlight their awareness. The idea is that the only truth we can know is what is happening in the present moment. Gestaltists believe that you have to understand a person within their context: race, family, culture and religion. This means a good Gestalt therapist would not have any presuppositions about the patient. They wouldn't, for instance, say a snake has sexual connotations, because if the patient comes from a country in which snakes are commonplace, their dreams about snakes are going to have a different significance than those of a person who has never seen a snake outside of a zoo. Once the therapy has made the patient truly aware of their fixed Gestalts, it moves on to experimenting with different ways of being. This method of enactment and role play sets Gestalt apart from most other therapies. Working on the idea that our nervous systems cannot tell the difference between a real experience and a vividly imagined experience, the patient can address unfinished business through the use of imagination, dreams and fantasies. Most therapists do couple and family work as well as individual therapy. The therapy tends to be long term. Transactional Analysis As first developed by Eric Berne (1958), this is a multifaceted system of psychotherapy. It is both a theory of personality and a system for the improvement of personal and social functioning. Transactional analysis (TA) has been subjected to some charges of shallowness due to its huge popularity in the 60s with Thomas A Harris's book, I'm OK - You're OK. In fact, it is a deceptively simple therapy which is couched in a methodology that is easy to understand. Berne felt that thinking about the way we feel and behave should be accessible to everyone. TA concepts such as the \"inner child\" and \"psychological games\" have become absorbed into popular vocabulary. TA takes its starting point from Freud's theory of the ego. It identifies three ego states: The Parent, The Adult and The Child. It aims to clarify life experiences by examining how we learned our beliefs and values from our parents and other parent figures, and how being in different ego states can influence our behaviour and relationships. TA looks at the way that we hang on to sometimes unhelpful \"life scripts\" and play games as methods of survival, at the expense of fulfilment and self-realisation. There are three main types of TA analyst: the clinical practitioner, who does psychotherapy; the educational analyst; and the organisational analyst, whose work involves looking at transactions that take place in the work place. This type of therapy is usually offered weekly and is practised both in groups and individually. Cognitive Analytic Therapy This therapy is an integration of mainly cognitive and psychoanalytic approaches. There is a clear emphasis on working collaboratively with clients, the purpose being to enable them to gain a coherent and memorable understanding of past un-met needs, unmanageable feelings and how these combine to play a role in maintaining present difficulties. As an integrative model, CAT responds adaptively to each client; it looks at the bigger picture of the client's psychological world and explains it in clear ways that enable the person to feel less trapped and more able to care for themselves and do their own psychological self-help homework outside the session. It works with individuals but also can be used with couples and groups. The aim is to link present interpersonal difficulties with early life experience. Although this therapy uses techniques such as transference within the therapeutic relationship, it is much briefer and more focused than psychoanalytic therapy, generally involving 16 sessions. It uses active methods such as psychological education, diary keeping, diagrams and letter writing. Counselling Counselling is simply a description of a role rather than a particular theoretical practice; it embodies a wide range of techniques and approaches, from specific advice and treatment programmes, through to longer term psychotherapy. Although professionals in the field tend to emphasise the difference between counselling and psychotherapy, the differences that do exist are to a large extent based on length of training. Psychotherapists tend to undergo a longer training, although some counsellors have trained for many years. As a general rule of thumb, if part of your life is a problem, see a counsellor, whereas if the whole of your life is a problem, see a psychotherapist.
