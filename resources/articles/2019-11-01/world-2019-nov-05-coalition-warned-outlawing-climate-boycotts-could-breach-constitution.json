The attorney-general Christian Porter has nominated activist group Market Forces as the intended target of the Coalition\u2019s efforts to temper activism, flagged by Morrison during a combative speech in Brisbane last Friday, but some government MPs are confused about precisely what is being proposed, and are concerned about the potentially negative implications for freedom of expression. The attorney general has accused Market Forces of trying to \u201cimpose their political will on companies across the country through widespread, coordinated harassment and threats of boycotts\u201d and revealed that environmental litigation and litigation funders are also in the government\u2019s sights. Porter\u2019s comments clarify a speech given by Scott Morrison on Friday suggesting the government will apply penalties to secondary boycotts done for the dominant purpose of environmental protection, which are currently permitted. University of New South Wales law school dean Prof George Williams said the move would risk breaching the implied freedom of political communication in the constitution. \u201cWe would likely see a challenge mounted in the high court,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. Prof Graeme Orr of the University of Queensland said it was \u201chard to be definitive\u201d as the government was still at the stage of \u201cflying kites\u201d in its secondary boycott proposal. But he accused the government of \u201ctargeting protests under the guise of a law designed to combat misuse of market power or union power\u201d. Orr said state governments \u2013 not the federal government \u2013 were responsible for general police powers and suggested that Morrison had \u201cstitched together two separate issues\u201d by linking protests he characterised as anarchistic with competition law powers. \u201cIt\u2019s a constitutional, moral and political minefield in an age where people are more frequently sounding off on social media, encouraging others to put pressure on businesses as the primary or secondary target of a boycott.\u201d Orr noted that Nationals MP George Christensen has previously advocated a boycott of Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s ice cream over its stance in favour of same-sex marriage. Several government backbenchers contacted by Guardian Australia on Tuesday expressed confusion about precisely what the government was championing, but declined to express their concerns on the record given the government is yet to produce a concrete proposition. In a statement, Porter said the government was considering ways to target \u201cboycotts or protests [that] are designed to deliberately inflict economic harm on Australian businesses that are doing nothing other than lawfully providing goods and services to mining projects\u201d. Porter claimed that \u201cradical activist groups like Market Forces \u2026 punish or threaten to punish hard-working businesses for any association or involvement they may have in mining projects as a deliberate and targeted means of trying to force their own radical political views on companies and workers\u201d. The attorney general revealed the government was also considering reforms to prevent \u201cthe growing presence of litigation funders\u201d in class actions targeting the mining sector and \u201cother areas where activists exploit legal process in a concerted engagement in \u2018lawfare\u2019 designed to delay, frustrate and cause unnecessary expense to mining and other legitimate commercial projects and businesses in Australia\u201d. The chief executive of Market Forces, Julien Vincent, told Guardian Australia it was now clear the government \u201cwants to \u2026 stop us going about our work\u201d, but that the work was an \u201centirely legitimate\u201d means of encouraging companies to pursue better environmental outcomes. Vincent said the \u201cbig risk\u201d was that the government would \u201cimpinge on the rights of individuals to use information to choose products and services on the basis of environmental outcomes\u201d. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have groups shine light on that, what you get is quiet Australians \u2013 people who don\u2019t have a voice, or a mechanism to speak up.\u201d In 2014, the Abbott government considered applying penalties to environmental secondary boycotts. In 2015, the Harper competition review said that in the absence of \u201ccompelling evidence\u201d on the point, it saw no need for change, although the exception should be reassessed \u201cif such evidence arises from future boycott activity\u201d. Ian Harper, now dean of Melbourne Business School, said the review had sought to balance the \u201creasonable claims\u201d of those protesting on environmental or consumer protection grounds with \u201cthe rights of businesses not directly involved with the issue to go about their affairs without disruption\u201d. \u201cSubmissions to the review made it clear that, absent an exception on environmental and/or [consumer protection] grounds, an outright ban on secondary boycotts could set the [Competition and Consumer Act] in tension with common law rights to protest and perhaps contravene the broader public interest in doing so,\u201d he told Guardian Australia. The review also distinguished public advocacy campaigns \u2013 which seek to influence consumer and business behaviour \u2013 from secondary boycotts which \u201caim not just to influence but also to hinder or prevent the supply or acquisition of goods or services\u201d. \u201cThe panel considers that, although a public advocacy campaign may damage a business, it does so by attempting to influence the behaviour of businesses and consumers,\u201d it said. \u201cBusinesses and consumers are free to make up their own minds about the merits of the campaign.\u201d On Sunday, Anthony Albanese said it was \u201cvery difficult to see\u201d how the government could \u201cstop individuals campaigning about corporate behaviour\u201d. Albanese described the right to protest as \u201can important part of freedom of expression\u201d and said that \u201cany Liberal, who is the leader of a Liberal party, seeking to expunge that, is, in my view, very dangerous indeed\u201d. However, Albanese said protests should be peaceful and conducted \u201cin a way that actually gets support for their cause\u201d, adding that some protests had \u201calienated people\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
