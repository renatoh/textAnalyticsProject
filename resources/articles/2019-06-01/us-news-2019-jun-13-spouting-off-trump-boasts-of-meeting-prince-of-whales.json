Listing \u201cthe Queen of England (U.K.)\u201d and the leaders of France, Poland and Ireland, Trump wrote on Thursday that he had also spoken to \u201cthe Prince of Whales\u201d. Social media users reacted with delight to the gaffe, posting pictures imagining how such a meeting might have looked. There were pictures of whales looking suitably regal and ready for the pomp and circumstance of a state visit. And marine-themed makeovers for Prince Charles himself. There were a lot of puns: Some of the familiar Trump meme pictures came out with new captions. While others took the opportunity to redesign the iconic Y Ddraig Goch with a fresh new Trumpian look. Nostalgia for the Free Willy movies surfaced. And users with a long history of Twitter could not help but recall how appropriate the gaffe was, given that Twitter\u2019s own original emblem of service failure used to be known as the \u201cfail whale\u201d. During Trump\u2019s state visit to the UK, he met the Prince of Wales on several occasions, including a dinner at Winfield House, the US ambassador\u2019s residence in London, where Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, were the guests of honour. The president was tweeting on Thursday in the context of a recent interview where he appeared to suggest he would not contact law enforcement if he were offered information from a foreign power that might help him in the 2020 US election. As yet, unlike with Russia, there have been no suggestions that marine mammals played any significant role in his 2016 victory. Trump has subsequently deleted and posted a corrected version of the original tweet. Trump\u2019s tweets have previously gifted the world the word covfefe."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
