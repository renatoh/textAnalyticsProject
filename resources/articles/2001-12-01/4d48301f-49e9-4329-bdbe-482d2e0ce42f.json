I had read my guidebook, and obtained a visa and an international certificate of immunisation against yellow fever. I'd even boned up on the extraordinary history of the place, on the Solomonic lineage that ended with the overthrow of the last emperor, Haile Selassie, and the more recent wars with Eritrea. I'd packed my mosquito spray, iodine tablets and factor 25; but, still, I wasn't really prepared. I don't know how anybody could be. The culture shock begins in Addis Ababa, a sprawling modern city that boasts the biggest street market in Africa, and whose museum houses the almost intact skeleton of one of the earliest humans who roamed this region 3.5 million years ago, named Lucy by scientists. According to my guidebook, Addis is also the place where you are most likely to be pickpocketed in Africa, though how they worked that one out remains a mystery. A few hours to the north lies the village of Bahir Dar where I actually do get pickpocketed. In a field. Not just any field, mind. This one is full of men in white robes with burning torches, one of whom has just set alight a bonfire beneath a huge wooden cross. I'm not making this up. All across Ethiopia, on 26 September, holy men and women gather to celebrate the feast of Mescel by singing, swaying and chanting for hours on end. This is Christianity as it used to be: colourful and mystical, following a centuries-old choreography. As darkness descends, a couple of hundred youths break through the thin line of elders and charge, screaming and shouting, toward the blazing fire. Like a human tidal wave, they carry all before them, me included. One moment I'm chatting to a tall, easy-going Englishman, the next, he is 20 yards away, a look of resigned bemusement on his face. Being a Celt, I don't do resigned bemusement. Instead, I panic and bulldoze my way to the edge of the field, emerging from the mel\u00e9e shaken, but not charred. My trouser pockets have been pulled inside out, though, and somebody is 100 birr the richer, which is a lot of money to an Ethiopian teenager - a month's wages in a village like this - but only about eight quid to me. Back on the tour bus, the incident becomes a bonding moment. Suddenly I am glad I am in the company of a dozen strangers, however annoying/odd/opinionated some of them might be. I'm on an organised tour with adventure specialist Explore Worldwide. Except for school trips as a teenager, where I at least knew from the outset who was annoying/ odd/opinionated, I have never done anything like this before. There are three men and nine women in our group, plus the guide, Fran. Most of the women are veterans of this kind of thing, with at least half a dozen tours under their belts, which is impressive considering the organisers cram as much activity as possible into the limited time. Afterwards, you may feel, as I did, that you need a holiday to recover. Mostly, though, this is an Africa-lite expe rience: our hotels are surprisingly grand and our bus is protected from the hassle that attends independent travellers. Nevertheless, we witness poverty every day. Sometimes, as in poorer parts of India and South America, we wonder what we are doing here in the first place. My guidebook had sections on 'Giving, Begging and Guilt': the latter is hardest for the tourist to avoid. Ethiopia has three things in abundance: children, birds and churches. There are children everywhere. Even on the remotest mountain road they appear as if by magic, shouting, 'You! You! You!', as they surround the bus. After a few days, we heard children shouting 'You! You! You!' in our sleep. Birds, too, are ubiquitous: blue ones, orange ones, yellow ones. In the grounds of a hotel on the shores of Lake Tana, one of our group spotted 20 varieties of exotic bird; there are more than 800 in total. Ethiopia is a twitcher's paradise. Someone else, though, went for a walk by the lake and saw a 20ft python slide into the water. After hearing that, I started twitching in earnest. Lake Tana, the largest lake in Ethiopia, is swollen and butterscotch brown after the rains. On our crossing, we pass small papyrus boats loaded with huge piles of charcoal, their owners rowing to the mainland market. The church of Saint Mary, hidden in semi-tropical woodland, is the first of many churches of Saint Mary we will see in the next 10 days. Like most of the others, it is extraordinarily beautiful: round, wooden, and painted inside with surreal, often gory scenes from the Bible, including a man cutting off his own tongue. A white-robed priest appears and shows us some ancient illustrated manuscripts and ornate silver crosses. After a week, I am also seeing churches in my sleep. The twelfth-century churches of Lalibela hewn from rock and awe-inspiring, briefly restore my faith. Once you've seen half a dozen wooden churches, though, your spirit, however holy, begins to wilt. And your ankles begin to itch: visitors must enter churches barefoot; the floors are spread with ancient carpets, which are home to several species of flea. Fleas are the least of your worries - or that is what I told myself as I counted the parasites sharing my room in the village of Debark, high in the Simien mountains. Counting fleas is not as effective as counting sheep and becomes downright alarming when you reach double figures. The brochure described this joint as 'basic' - here, even the fleas had fleas. I won't dwell on the horrors of the outside toilet except to say it provided another chance for group bonding. Our increasingly bedraggled crew bonded some more over the evening meal of injera, pronounced 'endure-a' for reasons that soon became apparent. Made from tef, a grain unique to Ethiopia, injera is a large pancake that looks like a flannel dishcloth and tastes even worse than it looks. It is served with wat, a spicy sauce that counters the sour taste of the bread. With happy hearts we board the bus to Axum the next morning. The journey takes 12 hours. The first stage crosses the high Simiens, 13,000ft above sea level, before returning to the foothills, which are fringed with purple, yellow and golden wild flowers. Having managed to nod off despite the spectacular views, I am woken by my companions' screams of excitement at the sight of several Gelada baboons on a ridge above the road. We jump out and begin photographing frantically until the leader of the baboons rises up, bares his teeth and blood-red chest and screeches. We scramble back on the bus, babbling like excited children. Ten hours later, after a 2,000ft descent, we arrive in the most ancient holy place in Africa. The Ark of the Covenant, carried down the mountain by Moses, is said to have been discovered here, but no one, except the priest who guards it in a fortified compound, has seen it. We duly take photographs of the compound, which I later realise is a singularly uninteresting building. Axum is a mysterious place. There are few of the young men - dubbed 'walkie-talkies' by local guides - who attach themselves, limpet like, at your side as soon as you descend from the tour bus anywhere else in Ethiopia. The first thing I noticed was not the proliferation of tall, thin stones standing everywhere, but the proliferation of tall, thin men carrying Kalashnikovs. In Axum, ancient and modern collide: the standing stones date back to the third century while the guns are a reminder of the Eritrean war. After lunch we descend into King Ramhai's tomb, which has two stone coffins. Our guide knocks on one and an eerie hollow ring echoes round the burial chamber. Spooky. As guides go, he is a genuine enthusiast, with a neat line in dramatic evasion. 'How did they build this huge tomb?' he asks, pointing to the square stones above our heads. 'Nobody knows. It is a mystery!' Then, later: 'How did they erect these huge stones? Nobody knows. It is a mystery!' Mysterious, extreme and, at times, overwhelming, Ethiopia is not for the faint-hearted; but every day, in one way or another, it will take your breath away. Factfile Getting there: Sean O'Hagan travelled to Ethiopia with Explore Worldwide, which operates regular tours between September and March.

Red tape: A tourist visa is required. Contact the Ethiopian Embassy in London (020 7589 7212). Check the expiry date on your passport, which should be at least six months after you intend to leave Ethiopia. Health: Visitors need yellow fever immunisation and must show an international immunisation certificate to obtain a visa. You should also be immunised against typhoid, meningitis, polio, tetanus and hepatitis A. Malaria tablets are recommended. Money: Take US dollars rather than sterling.
