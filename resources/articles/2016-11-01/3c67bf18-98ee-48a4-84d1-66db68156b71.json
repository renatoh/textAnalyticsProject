The 27-year-old required lengthy treatment on the side of the pitch during Saturday\u2019s 1-1 World Cup qualifying draw against Wales, with his face covered in blood after Taylor caught him on the bridge of the nose. Tadic later returned to the action with cotton wool stuffed up his nose to stem the bleeding but admitted he was struggling to breathe at times. \u201cI think I have broken my nose,\u201d he said. \u201cAt first I thought I could not see so many things but I couldn\u2019t leave my team-mates alone on the pitch and I wanted to play and this is important. Every player feels really important for the team. You cannot leave team-mates without you. \u201cI couldn\u2019t breathe or do anything and I lost a lot of blood. I see a little bit also not so good. But that does not matter as when you play a game you want to fight for your country to try to give your best.\u201d Tadic was relaxed about the fact that Alberto Mallenco, the Spanish referee, chose not to book Taylor for the challenge. \u201cSpanish referees have a different criteria. He gave a little bit of a \u2018fight game\u2019, you know, and that is good for Wales. But this is not important. The tackle on me was really hard but this is the referee\u2019s decision. We don\u2019t need to think about that. I saw Taylor after the game and he asked me how it was. I said it is OK.\u201d Serbia take on Ukraine in a friendly on Tuesday night and Tadic gave the impression that playing in that match was more important than worrying about a trip to hospital. \u201cSerbia people are not soft,\u201d he said, before leaving the door open to face Liverpool. \u201cWe will see. I can wear a mask.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
