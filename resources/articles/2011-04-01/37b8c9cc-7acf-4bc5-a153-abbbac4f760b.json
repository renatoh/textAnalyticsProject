After widespread protests in the Middle East and north Africa, democracy activists and journalists have taken to the streets to demand democratic reform and improved human rights, most recently on 17 April. The government has responded by clamping down on freedom of assembly and freedom of expression. Fatullayev's case symbolises the rapid deterioration of media freedom in the country. Imprisoned even after a European court ruling in his favour, his continued persecution reveals a government unwilling to tolerate criticism. For journalists, civil activists and those using social networks to organise protests, the situation is becoming increasingly dangerous, with a spate of arrests and attacks in recent weeks. Human rights organisations have also faced closure. In the runup to World Press Freedom Day on 3 May, it is vital that the international community takes notice of the situation in Azerbaijan. Today, as Eynulla marks his fourth year in jail, we call for his release, and for the Azerbaijani government to comply with international standards on human rights \u2013 specifically the right to assembly and the right to free expression.
