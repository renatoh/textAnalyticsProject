In the men\u2019s final Rafael Nadal won his fifth Rogers Cup title with a comfortable 6-3, 6-0 win over Daniil Medvedev. The 19-year-old Andreescu, who became the first Canadian woman to reach the final of the tournament since 1969, took the title after Serena Williams had to retire with a back injury in the first set. Andreescu was leading 3-1 at the time. \u201cI\u2019m speechless right now. I\u2019m the first Canadian to make the final and win this tournament since 1969,\u201d said Andreescu after the match. \u201cThis week has not been easy, I\u2019ve had many many tough matches, and especially what I\u2019ve been through the last two months hasn\u2019t been easy. I kept telling myself never give up.\u201d Williams appeared to be in tears as she was treated by the trainer, and TV microphones picked up a mention of back spasms when she talked to Andreescu after the match. She had beaten Naomi Osaka, who she faced in last year\u2019s US Open final, in the quarter-finals. This year\u2019s US Open starts later this month. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t do it today, I tried but I just couldn\u2019t do it,\u201d said Williams at the post-match presentation. \u201cBianca, you are a great sportswoman. Thanks to my team. It\u2019s been a tough year, but we\u2019ll keep going.\u201d Andreescu has faced a similar situation to Williams this year: she was forced to withdraw from the French Open and has missed the last few months with injury. It is her second title since springing to prominence after winning the Indian Wells title in March. Williams has not won a title since returning from the birth of her daughter although she has reached three grand slam finals since then."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
