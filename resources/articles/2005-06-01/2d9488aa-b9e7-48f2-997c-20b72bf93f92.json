As a professional player you listen to a lot of pre-match speeches - some of them Churchillian, some of them not - but something Ian McGeechan said to us on Wednesday really brought home what being a Lion is all about. Now, I've seen bits of the famous Living with Lions video from 1997 and I've heard Geech speak before, but I found listening to him incredibly emotional. What struck me most was when he discussed the jersey we were about to wear. He told us we wouldn't be alone because all the players who had worn it before had left a piece of themselves inside it. I thought back to the great full-backs I'd admired as a youngster, such as JPR Williams. In that moment I felt special, lucky and honoured. Maybe, if things went well and I played well, we could also be part of a winning Lions series. I was aching to play by the time we left the room. And, by now, you'll know it did go well against Taranaki. Yes, things looked dicey at half-time but we came through and I managed to score my first tries in a Lions jersey. And yes, since you ask, I was aware I had to have a good game to aspire to the standard set by Josh Lewsey against Bay of Plenty. People, naturally enough, had made an issue out of Josh playing so well. You wouldn't be human if you weren't conscious of it. So how do you prepare for a game which could define your tour? For me, the first priority is not to get too agitated. I can honestly say I was happy Josh played so well. I know that might sound strange given the competition for Test places. But it's true. This is the pinnacle of our rugby careers. We all have to play to the best of our ability. When Josh produced the goods it simply meant I had to play well too. I'm not the type who goes out looking for glory but I was conscious I needed a mistake-free game. It was important not to make a mess of it. Filling the hours before kick-off was, if I'm honest, harder than usual. Normally I try and go to watch a movie the night before a game but there wasn't really anything on in New Plymouth; we're not talking Las Vegas. I went to bed early but I couldn't sleep. At least I didn't wake up early but we still had plenty of time in which to stew until our pre-match meal in late afternoon. It tends to be pretty standard chicken and pasta, high in carbohydrates but nicer than you would get at home because we've brought along our own chef. By this time, though, you're experiencing a cocktail of emotions: your mind's racing, you're nervous and apprehensive and you just want the game to start. I was talking to Will Greenwood and he's similar to me: three hours beforehand he gets nervous but an hour before kick-off everything changes and the arrogant side of being a professional sportsman comes out. You get out for your warm-up and everything's suddenly fine; it's familiar, it's routine, it's where you want to be. Then there's the all-important choice of pre-match music. I decide on Guns n' Roses and AC/DC; there are occasions when Coldplay doesn't hit the spot. And then we're in the dressing room, getting ready. I like to make sure everything is where I want it: spare shirt there, spare gumshield here. People are getting strapped up and Martin Corry, as captain, is getting everyone fired up. And then all of a sudden, the doors open and you're out. I can understand why Cozza forgot to pick up the cuddly lion mascot which Lions captains traditionally run out with. We were all pretty pumped. The Lions' anthem is a little bit too high-pitched for me - and I was worried about the glass in the executive box windows when the lady singing God Defend New Zealand hit her stride - but it wasn't my top priority. For what it's worth I also didn't feel there was much wrong with my \"disallowed\" try in the first half. I thought it was pretty harsh. Maybe the fact Shane Horgan was falling and I hit his pass as hard as I did magnified it. In Super 12 I don't think there would have been a problem but we're realistic enough to know those borderline decisions will probably go against us over here. Nor are we anticipating many favours when we face the New Zealand Maori in Hamilton tomorrow. My head coach at my old school in Auckland has phoned to tell me it's probably the strongest Maori side in years. But already this tour feels like a rolling stone. Two wins have given us some vital momentum."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
