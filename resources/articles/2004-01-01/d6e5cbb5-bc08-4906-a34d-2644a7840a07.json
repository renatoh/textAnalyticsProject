Distance: 2,700 kilometres A classic journey through Central America, tracing the route of the ancient Mayans, the indigenous people of Guatemala, Belize and Mexico. Doing it by brightly painted chicken bus is part of the fun and is the best way to arrive at the colourful local markets, famed for their textiles. For a perfect combo, take in the Mexican Mayan ruins of Uxmal and Chichen Itza; chill out in Belize for white-water rafting and diving the barrier reef; then see Guatemala's great carpets of jungle, the volcanic landscapes of Lake Atitlan and Tikal, the most atmospheric of the Mayan sites, where the hush is pierced by screeching parrots, toucans and howler monkeys. Transport: Bus Timing: 22 days Fitness: C Do it with: Journey Latin America (020 8747 8315; www.journeylatinamerica.co.uk) includes all the above in its 21-night 'Quetzal' escorted tour, from \u00a31,931 2 Milford Track, New Zealand Teanau Downs - Milford Sound. Distance: 50km Traversing the heart of South Island's wild fjord country, the Milford Track is often described as the finest walk in the world. Famed for spectacular sogginess, Milford in the rain - when torrents of water rush down the inky mountains - was the eighth wonder of the world according to Kipling. Highlights include a possible encounter with a genuine kiwi, periwinkle blue glacial lakes, sheer granite canyons and mystical mossy forests (very Lord of the Rings). On sunny days you can swim in icy water holes, and risk a drenching by walking right behind the roaring Sutherland Falls, fifth highest on the planet at 540m (1,904ft). The trek culminates in a boat trip on Milford Sound, home to fur seals and bottlenose dolphins. Transport: Foot/boat Timing: 5 days Fitness: B Do it with: High Places (0114 275 7500; www.highplaces.co.uk) offers a 15-night fly-drive tour of South Island, including the five-day guided trek, for \u00a32,450 3 Road to Damascus Damascus (Syria) - Petra (Jordan). Distance: 300km In some ways there's never been a better time to visit the Middle East as continuing troubles mean fewer tourist hordes. Twinning Syria with Jordan combines the best of the region's famed crusader castles and desert cities. Damascus, once the centre of the Islamic world, and Jordan's Rose Red City of Petra, best seen from horseback, rank on the globe's must-see list alongside the pyramids and the Taj. Other high points of this road trip include the ancient caravan cities of Dura Europos and Palmyra and the well-preserved Roman city of Jerash. You also get the chance to rumble into the eerily quiet desert of Wadi Rum by 4WD. It's easy to see why the famed wind-whipped dunes starred in the film Lawrence of Arabia, as well as many others. Transport: Bus/horse/4WD Timing: 17 days Fitness: C/D Do it with: Explore Worldwide (01252 760000; www.exploreworldwide.com) from \u00a31,055 4 Glacier Express, Switzerland London Waterloo - Switzerland return. Distance: 2,500km Thanks to Eurostar, you can do the entire journey from the UK to Switzerland by train and experience some of the world's most stupendous alpine scenery without the airport crush. Linking the elegant, traffic-free resort of Zermatt with St Moritz, the idea is to hop on and off and walk in summer, ski in winter. First-class is a must for the wood-panelled dining car and unique bent-stemmed wine glasses to avoid a spill on steep gradients. The slow chug up the Rhone Valley to Andermatt, then over the Oberalp Pass down to Chur is the most thrilling section, best in winter when layers of meringue-like snow soften the mountains, waterfalls freeze rigid and you can wave at the skiers whooshing past. Transport: Train Timing: 10 days Fitness: D Do it with: Great Rail Journeys (01904 521940; www.greatrail.com) from \u00a31,150 first class, \u00a3850 standard class, including dinner, B&amp;B hotel accommodation 5 Road to Timbuktu, Mali Bamako - Timbuktu. Distance: 900km This fabled city in Mali, one of Africa's landlocked and least-visited countries, lures adventure travellers with the promise of a genuine time warp. On the southern edge of the Sahara, it is being slowly lost to the encroaching sands: so go before it disappears. Visit the 14th-century mosque with a mysterious door that has never been opened, meet the 15,000 remaining nomadic Tuareg, join them on a camel ride and sleep out under the stars. Other Mali highlights include sailing a traditional pinasse down the Niger river, camping out on the banks, and visiting the Dogon villages, known for their cave-like houses with stone steps scoured out of the cliff face. Don't go if you need fluffy towels and ice in drinks. Transport: Bus/boat/camel Timing: 14 days Fitness: B/C Do it with: The Imaginative Traveller (0800 316 2717; www.imaginative-traveller.com) includes all the above from \u00a31,575; next departure October 2004 6 Ho Chi Minh Trail, Vietnam Ho Chi Minh City - Hanoi. Distance: 1,700km The bicycle is still the main means of transport in Asia's friendliest emerging country so it's the perfect way to get to know the locals. You don't have to pedal the entire distance from Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon) in the south to Hanoi in the north as all public transport happily carries two wheels. Push yourself up mountain passes, wreathed in mists like an oriental painting then take it easier on the flat, alongside emerald rice paddies, dotted with temples and curvy pagodas. Don't miss: the Cu Chi tunnels, where the Viet Cong lived like human moles and outwitted the Americans; China Beach, a white sand stunner where the troops came for R&amp;R; or a sampan trip down the Perfume River. Transport: Bicycle Timing: 19 days Fitness: B Do it with: Exodus Biking Adventures (020 8675 5550; www.exodus.co.uk) from \u00a31,595, excluding cycle hire 7 Everest Base Camp, Nepal Kathmandu - Mt Everest. Distance: 250km To the Sherpas and Tibetans, Everest is 'Chomolungma' - Mother Goddess of the Earth. To the rest of us, the crown jewel of the Himalayas invokes tales of unbelievable human courage and strength. Today a trek to Base Camp should be within range of any fit regular weekend walker. Those who've done it say nothing compares with that roof-of- the-world feeling as you stand there in awed silence surrounded by towering snow-capped peaks. That said, the Himalayas are as famed for their vibrant rhododendron forests as their snowy tops. You'll also need a camera for cliff-side monasteries with football playing monks in saffron robes, colourful yak trains accompanied by local black-eyed urchins and vertiginous swing bridges decorated with fluttering prayer flags. Transport: Foot Timing: 20 days Fitness: A Do it with: Walks Worldwide (01524 242000; www.walksworldwide.com) for \u00a31,795, including time off in Kathmandu before and after the trek 8 Silk Route Kashgar (China) then Tashkent - Samarkand - Khiva (Uzbekistan). Distance: 1,570km The tangled alleyways, spice-laden bazaars and grand domed architecture of ancient Silk Road stopovers such as Tashkent, Kashgar and Samarkand are childhood storybook cities. Once the only trading and cultural link between the East and Europe, these central Asian 'caravan' towns were almost forgotten until their rediscovery by Russian and British spies, which only adds to the frisson of mystery. Aim to do it at leisure, starting in Beijing with time for the Great Wall, before moving on to the Heaven Lake at Urumqi, Kashgar with its celebrated Sunday market, Tashkent and Khiva - a mythical living museum of a city with minarets, mosques, tiny, twisting streets and pomegranate-red desert sunsets. Transport: Car/plane Timing: 21 days Fitness: C/D Do it with: Audley Travel (01869 276217; www.audleytravel.com) features all the cities above with connecting flights, private car and driver for \u00a33,250 9 North West Passage Anchorage, Alaska (USA) - Anadyr (Russia) by air, then boat to Bering Strait - Herschel Island - Cambridge Bay - Beechey Island - Resolute (Canada). Distance: 4,700km Often known as the Amundsen Route, this is a genuine epic voyage on little-explored waterways, crossing the Arctic Circle, linking the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The excitement starts from day one with a helicopter transfer from Anchorage, Alaska, to your trusty ice-breaker Kapitan Khlebnikov. As well as stunning ice and snow scenery, including calving icebergs and glaciers, you should encounter polar bears, seals, musk oxen and arctic foxes. Highlights include whale-watching in the Bering Strait, visiting remote Inuit communities, and viewing the weathered remains of the Maud, the schooner in which Amundsen sailed the north polar basin in the 1920s. Transport: Ship Timing: 20 days Fitness: C/D Do it with: Discover the World (01737 214250; www.discover-the-world.co.uk) offers the voyage above, including flights, from \u00a36,969; next departure 26 July 10 Shogun Trail, Japan Tokyo - Fukuoka. Distance: 600km A relatively new route, introduced in 2002, this follows the cross-country path taken by the Japanese nobility and Samurai warriors as they travelled each year from the feudal court in Tokyo to their regional palaces. Today's trail also makes use of the bullet train to Hakone, home to more than 60 temples and shrines; Kyoto, regarded as the cradle of Japan's culture as well as its loveliest city; and Hiroshima, where the Peace Memorial Park acts as a grim reminder of the first atom bomb. The route includes a cruise to the so-called 'Ninety Nine Islands', once important whaling ports, often overlooked by Western visitors . Transport: Foot/train/boat Timing: 13 days Fitness: C Do it with: Explore Worldwide (01252 760000; www.exploreworldwide.com) from \u00a32,220 11 The Ghan, Australia Darwin - Alice Springs - Adelaide. Distance: 2,625km Named after the tough Afghan camel drivers who brought trade and provisions to the heart of the continent, the Ghan has always evoked the romance of the Outback. The long-awaited link to Darwin from Alice Springs opens next month, making it possible for the first time to cross the country from Adelaide by the 'silver' train, with its idiosyncratic steel-clad carriages. Starting in the green hills of the temperate wine-growing region, the train snakes through to the harsh red outline of the MacDonnell Ranges before encountering the lush emerald rainforest of the Top End. Transport: Train Timing: 47 hours Fitness: D Do it with: Travelbag (0870 890 1458; www.travelbag.co.uk) offers a 14-night Australian package, including the Ghan, plus stops in Darwin, Alice and a five-night camper-van tour of Kangaroo Island for \u00a31,669 12 Coral Route Auckland (New Zealand) - Fiji - Samoa - Cook Islands - Tahiti - Auckland. Distance: 8,000km In the 1940s, a privileged few took the most romantic flying route in history, from Auckland by seaplane to the coral islands of the South Pacific, stopping for lobster and champagne picnics on the way. You can still do it, sadly without the old flying boats. Until you've witnessed one of the Pacific's characteristic lagoons, you won't know the true meaning of the word 'blue'. Naturally there are lots of hotels and locals after your tourist dollar, but the sand truly is like walking on powdered silk, ripe tropical fruit falls off the tree into your lap and people still look as if they are posing for Gauguin. Transport: Plane Timing: 21 days Fitness: D Do it with: Transpacific Holidays (01293 567722; www.transpacificholidays.co.ukwww.transpacificholidays.co.uk) has a trip which includes flights and accommodation on most of the islands above for \u00a33,246 13 Berber Trail, Morocco Marrakesh - Toubkal. Distance: 90km The exotic Arabian Nights city of Marrakesh thrills even world-weary travellers with its aromatic souks, fire eaters, snake charmers and acrobats. Twin it with trekking the Berber Trail in the neighbouring Atlas mountains and you have the perfect partnership. Your goal is the summit of Toubkal, the highest peak in North Africa at 4,167m (13,700ft), a challenging climb but not a technical one. The stupendous view from the summit is reward enough, but the lower slopes, thick with daffodils and orchids, the copper and carrot-coloured butterflies, and the Berber stone-and-clay villages clinging to the hillsides are all enchanting. Leave room in your rucksack for Berber pots, Ali Baba-style leather slippers and 'magic' beaten metal lanterns. Transport: Foot Timing: 7 days Fitness: A/B Do it with: World Odyssey (01905 731373; www.world-odyssey.com) can arrange a five-day trek with guide, cook and muleteer, plus two nights in an authentic riad for \u00a31,039 14 Canoe the Zambezi Ruckomechi - Chickwenya Camp (Zimbabwe). Distance: 160km To canoe the length of Africa's mighty Zambezi river would mean a costly two-month expedition of around \u00a315,000 a head. However, anyone of average fitness should be able to manage a five-day paddle through Zimbabwe's Mana Pools national park in the river's lower reaches. Water, rather than engine power, allows you to get up close and personal to elephants and buffaloes swimming across the river to feed on the many tiny islands, and maybe less close to serious numbers of hippos and crocs. You can also expect to see lions, leopards, hyenas, monkeys, baboons, warthogs, jackals and the elusive wild dog. Birders are in feathered heaven with 350 recorded species, including rare African skimmers. Transport: Canoe/4WD Timing: 13 days Fitness: C Do it with: Sunvil Africa (020 8232 9777; www.sunvil.co.uk) offers a fully inclusive guided journey, including five days camping and canoeing, the rest in luxury riverside lodges, from \u00a32,647 15 Trans-Siberian Railway Moscow - Yekaterinberg - Irkutsk (Russia) - Ulan Bator (Mongolia) - Beijing (China). Distance: 7,000km There's no greater rail adventure than the week-long journey from Moscow to Beijing across tundra, vast Siberian plains and endless pine and birch forest. Everything you've heard about gauleiter-like carriage attendants and boring wastelands is true, yet it's still incredibly romantic. Unlike on the tarted-up Orient Express, your companions will be ordinary folk: Russian babushkas, Mongolian merchants and Chinese students. It may be slow, but it's never boring. Most break the journey with a stopover in Irkutsk to visit Siberia's Lake Baikal, where you can stay in a traditional ger (domed tent), and Ulan Bator, the dropped-off-the-edge capital of Mongolia. Transport: Train Timing: 7 days Fitness: C/D Do it with: Regent Holidays (0117 921 1711; www.regent-holidays.co.uk) has a 15-night itinerary, which includes flights and stops in the above, from \u00a31,680 16 Galapagos Islands, Ecuador Quito - Santa Cruz then boat to Galapagos. Distance: 1,727km It doesn't matter how many times you've seen Darwin's islands on wildlife documentaries - nothing prepares you for the thrill of being slap next to creatures who have evolved without the fear of man. Sea lions and iguanas are both so prolific that it's easy to become blas\u00e9 about almost tripping over family groups snoozing in the sun. It's hard to decide who are the greatest scene stealers: the giant lumbering tortoises, the cheeky boobies with comic blue feet, or the inky-black male frigate birds who inflate their awesome crimson throat pouches to impress the ladies in season. It's a hefty journey, so most combine a week afloat with a week in Ecuador. Transport: Boat Timing: 14 days Fitness: C/D Do it with: Trips Worldwide (0117 311 4404; www.tripsworldwide.co.uk) has a seven-night cruise aboard eight-berth motor yacht Cachelote, plus one week on the mainland for \u00a32,900 17 Inca Trail, Peru Cuzco - Kilometre 82 by train, then walk to Machu Picchu. Distance: 127km There's something about following a path once trodden by a lost civilisation, and even though you won't be alone (July and August are very busy), it's still one of the world's most rewarding treks. Along the route there are other ridge-top Inca ruins to explore, as well as waterfalls, distant snow-topped peaks and tiny hamlets where the locals dress up their lamas with tinkly bells, colourful rugs and gold-braided halters. Hidden away for centuries, your final stop at the magnificent citadel of Machu Picchu is one of the most imposing sights on the planet. Enter at the right time of day by the aptly named Sun Gate and it shimmers like a mirage, cloaked in silvery light. Transport: Foot Timing: 5 days Fitness: B/C Do it with: Last Frontiers (01296 653000; www.lastfrontiers.com) features a 10-night package with time off before and after the trek in Cuzco and Lima for \u00a31,375 18 Route 66, USA Chicago - St Louis - Tulsa - Amarillo - Santa Fe - Albuquerque - Flagstaff - Los Angeles. Distance: 3,860km Immortalised and romanticised both in song and on celluloid, Route 66 stretches 2,400 miles across the US from Chicago to Los Angeles. Along the way it weaves through Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico and Arizona, taking in several climate regions and time zones. Sadly, most of the original route was lost in the 1970s when the road was decommissioned, but nostalgia buffs refuse to let go, the old signs are going back up, and the spirit of the highway lives on in zinc and leather banquette diners selling proper juicy burgers and root-beer floats. The coolest way to cross it, as ever, is Easy Rider-style by Harley. Transport: Motorbike Timing: 15 days Fitness: C/D Do it with: AmeriCan &amp; Worldwide Travel (01892 511894; www.awwt.co.uk) offers flights, 14 nights' accommodation and bike hire on a group Harley-Davidson tour for \u00a33,775; next departure 10 July 19 The Migration Trail Arusha (Tanzania) - Nairobi (Kenya). Distance: 350km Africa's greatest dust and dung moment, the annual migration of up to one-and-a-half million wildebeest across the vast Serengeti, is one of the world's natural wonders. You don't have to be a wildlife freak to be stirred by the ground-trembling thunder of the hoofs and awed by the sight of a moving ocean of black beasts stretching to the horizon. The wildebeest also run with tens of thousands of skittish zebras, who have the cutest ever fluffy babies. The vast herds follow the rains from Tanzania to Kenya's Masai Mara where you can expect to see most of the big cats, as well as prolific birdlife. Add on Amboseli for elephant herds against the backdrop of snow-capped Kilimanjaro. Transport: 4WD Timing:14 days Fitness: D Do it with: Abercrombie &amp; Kent's (0845 070 0611; www.abercrombiekent.co.uk) Migration Safari visits all the parks above, staying in luxury lodges, from \u00a34,680 20 The Pilgrims' Route, Spain Ponferrada - Santiago de Compostela. Distance: 220km In the Middle Ages, the 500-mile trail from Roncesvalles in the Pyrenees to Santiago de Compostela in north-west Spain was the world's greatest pilgrimage route, covered by the most pious on their knees. Today no one expects you to go to such lengths, or walk the whole route, but the final stages of the old road still offer a glimpse of a vanished medieval way of life as you ramble past ancient monasteries and ruined castles, through rural hamlets with quaint thatched houses. The final two-mile descent from Monte do Gozo - the hill where the pilgrims first spotted the three spires of Santiago's cathedral - plus the promise of a Galician seafood dinner, make you forget sore feet and blisters. Transport: Foot Timing: 15 days Fitness: B/C Do it with: Waymark Holidays (01753 516477; www.waymarkholidays.com) offers a 14-night guided walk with luggage transported ahead, accommodation and some meals, from \u00a3975."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
