Share options handed out to 16,000 employees six years ago were maturing later today and the average payout was set to be \u00a31,500 - double the original value. The value of the scheme soared after Asda was bought by US giant Wal-Mart, the biggest retailer in the world, in 1999. Staff transferred their options into Wal-Mart stock, and this has increased by 35% to $54.20 dollars on Wall Street despite the recent US slowdown. Asda employees are given share options equivalent to a quarter of their salary after working one year with the company. They can decide to keep hold of the shares or sell them, keeping the profit over the original share price. More than 84,000 staff belong to the scheme; 80% of the Leeds-based grocer's staff. Asda's people director David Smith said: \"Asda and Wal-Mart believe all colleagues should have the opportunity to share in the company's success. \"And the long-term growth of Wal-Mart's share price is a real bonus for our colleagues who can look forward to reaping the rewards this week.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
