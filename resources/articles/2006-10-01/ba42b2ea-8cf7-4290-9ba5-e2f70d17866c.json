I'm your daughter's English teacher.\" At the other end of the phone line I can hear a stiffening, a small sigh, and a mother thinking \"Ohh ...\" \"I'm calling because I wanted to tell you your daughter produced some especially good work in class today and was a pleasure to teach.\" A Friday afternoon treat - and a good start to the weekend for an unsuspecting student. A few weeks in, I've been receiving my own feedback, too. As a Teach First trainee, I have a series of mentors with whom to discuss some problems and progress. Each Friday morning I sit down with my subject mentor, Caron Clifford, and receive some intensive one-on-one tuition. It makes all the difference. We look at my lesson plans and she listens to my retrospective of the week - and she points out the elements that made some of my lessons successful and suggests remedies for problems. She tells me to tighten up my aims for each lesson, focus on one angle, and be absolutely clear about what I want to get across. I've also had feedback from some of my younger classes, indirect and direct. In one introductory exercise, I divided my year 7 classes into small groups to discuss the qualities of a perfect teacher. This is an exercise my peers and I undertook at the very beginning of our own training this summer. Along with the obvious - fair and kind, fun and rich - the year 7s wanted their teacher to be skilful, travelled and, crucially, to have \"good fashion sense\" so that the class could concentrate and were able to \"look at the teacher without laughing\". I continued this market research by asking for a formal letter telling me what they'd most enjoyed in past classes. Reading through the letters, changing tenses and spellings, I found my own unexpected good start to the weekend. There's nothing quite like reading \"Ever since I've been a little girl I have hated English but ever since you have been teaching me, I have enjoyed it.\" It made me determined to spend Saturday in the classroom rearranging desks and Sunday in the company of a red pen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
