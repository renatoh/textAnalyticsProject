Luckily, I had a can of petrol in the back because I forgot to fill up in Fort William and ended up running out of petrol on the Kyle of Lochalsh Road. However, five miles further on there was a small hotel with a petrol pump, and after that, things were plain sailing. In fact, at Easter, petrol stations were almost the only things open on the far north coast. The trick is to fill up whenever you see a petrol station and you'll be fine - be prepared to pay a premium, though. Sarah Elton \u00b7 I've successfully toured northern Scotland on a motorbike that only did 100 miles to a tank of petrol. However, petrol stations usually won't be open 24 hours and you may have to divert off a main road to find one. Also, prices will be higher than your local supermarket. Sensible precautions like carrying a petrol can should mean you can relax and enjoy the stunning scenery. Even A roads can be very minor; that is, single track with passing places so your average speed will be much lower than usual, probably resulting in an improvement in fuel economy.
