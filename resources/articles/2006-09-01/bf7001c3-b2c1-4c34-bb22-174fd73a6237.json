She has spent the past six months analysing the aesthetic properties of Derby's public benches, which daily provide a welcome pitstop for thousands of weary legs. Her findings are contained in new research into public seating that Spencer has conducted as part of her 3D design and sustainable practice degree at the University of Derby. The research examines the quality and quantity of the public benches in Derby city centre, Grizedale Forest in Cumbria and the town of Bridlington, east Yorkshire. According to Spencer, who is a designer and artist, the results show that town planners still have an unimaginative approach to public facilities. Our outdoor seating is \"trapped in a timewarp\", with many of the UK's city centres still displaying simplified versions of the Victorian wooden-slat bench. The artist, who makes her own sustainable park benches using natural materials, is calling for more community participation in the design and construction of public benches. She believes that public seating has the potential to raise civic pride and contribute to the beautification of our towns and urban centres. \"Our public spaces should say something about the people who inhabit them,\" she says. \"Yet our towns and cities are increasingly looking monotonous and grey. A place like Derby has little or no public art, and I feel public benches have the potential to give our towns and city centres real character.\" Tim Willey, course director at the University of Derby, agrees. \"Public seating is a designer's dream,\" he says. \"It's something functional in the public domain that has got to be anti-vandal and unnickable ... In terms of public art, the potential for creativity doesn't get much better.\" The research also examined the social implications of inadequate public seating. Bridlington has a lack of public benches despite a high number of older inhabitants. Derby's attempts to curb skateboarding and vandalism have led to many seats becoming boxed in by waste bins or bollards, making it difficult for disabled people or mothers with pushchairs to use them. \"I'm hoping the research will be a bit of a call to action for councils,\" Spencer says. \"In Derbyshire's case, we shouldn't be allowing vandalism to have a negative impact on our public spaces. We need to reclaim our public benches for the people who really need them.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
