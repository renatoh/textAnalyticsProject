She also revealed that a calf injury was so serious that she was unable to jog as late as the end of May. \u201cAfter the Commonwealths my calf was definitely a huge issue,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen [the multi-event meeting] G\u00f6tzis started on 27 May, I still wasn\u2019t able to jog so I\u2019ve done a lot in a very short space of time. I didn\u2019t know what to expect coming into this competition. I just knew that my training was going well but that doesn\u2019t often correlate to competition fitness, so I was pleasantly surprised.\u201d The 25-year-old\u2019s score of 6,759 points after two compelling days of competition was higher than Jessica Ennis-Hill achieved in winning two of her three world titles. However, it was not quite good enough to topple Belgium\u2019s reigning world and Olympic champion, Nafi Thiam, who clung on to win by 57 points. \u201cShe is championship performer and a great champion,\u201d Johnson-Thompson said. \u201cI knew it would be a big ask in the 800m once she threw 57 metres in the javelin, but it didn\u2019t stop me from trying. \u201cBut I put her under pressure and I\u2019m excited for the battles in the future. She has got an incredible PB but it is definitely different in a championship, the long days, schedule and turning up. She brings out the best in me and hopefully I can bring out the best in her.\u201d After the event finished the pair hugged but Johnson-Thompson says she was too tired to talk much. \u201cI definitely said well done, though,\u201d she said. \u201cCarolin Sch\u00e4fer, who won bronze, said to me: \u2018You did it in my country and on my track,\u2019 and I said to her: \u2018Well you did it on my track last year\u2019, so it was a bit of payback. \u201cThis result means a lot to me, even though it is a silver, because of my preparation and what it took to get there. This is definitely one of the favourite performances of my career, despite not winning.\u201d Johnson-Thompson said that the performance had given her a huge amount of confidence for next year\u2019s world championships in Doha: \u201cI just need to focus on staying injury-free and making sure that my preparation goes smoothly because I feel like I\u2019ve figured out the heptathlon and I know how to do it now.\u201d The Liverpudlian believes that her heptathlon personal bests in the shot put and javelin could prove a significant turning point after so many issues in previous competitions. \u201cI have been working on it for years so it has finally clicked,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of my training throws were not good and I figured out how to change and that\u2019s very important. Not panicking and think: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s happening again.\u2019 I feel it\u2019s a turning point.\u201d It has been a successful European championships for Britain and they should win three more golds on Sunday\u2019s final day through Laura Muir in the 1500m and in the men\u2019s and women\u2019s 4x100m relay. If Muir succeeds she will create history, given that no British woman has won European 1500m gold before \u2013 Kelly Holmes came closest by winning silver in 1994 \u2013 and she says she has been inspired by watching Dina Asher-Smith win the 100m in a national record. \u201cI know Dina really well and we compete at the same competitions,\u201d said Muir. \u201cTo see her doing well is great. You just want to keep that momentum going. She opened it and hopefully I can close it.\u201d After that Muir intends to go on holiday for the first time in five years. \u201cI\u2019ve been told I have two weeks,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to Canada. Hopefully, start off in Toronto and then off to Calgary in the Rocky Mountains and hopefully see some grizzly bears.\u201d However, given the lack of world-class rivals in the 1500m there should be nothing to make her grizzle on the track on Sunday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
