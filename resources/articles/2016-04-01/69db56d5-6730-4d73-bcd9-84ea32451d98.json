Although the 61-year-old is less than halfway through his two-year deal at the Stadium of Light he is understood to have a break clause facilitating a potential exit this summer in the event of the team dropping into the Championship. \u201cThat decision will be made between me and Ellis [Short, Sunderland\u2019s owner],\u201d said Allardyce, who had previously hinted he would consider remaining to oversee an immediate promotion bid. Now, though, he has made it clear that would only become a reality if he felt his squad was strong enough and his budget big enough to sustain such a challenge. \u201cI\u2019m not going to speculate because I don\u2019t know how the budgets are going to lie, what and where we\u2019d have to cut financially. And I don\u2019t know exactly what sort of squad I\u2019d be left with until that position arises. And I don\u2019t want to talk about that prospect.\u201d Instead he remains confident Sunderland can survive while consigning Newcastle and Norwich to joining Aston Villa to English football\u2019s second tier. \u201cI have a squad that looks like they enjoy each other\u2019s company. It looks like they bond well together. It also looks like they have started to dig each other out, one or two of them. That\u2019s a massive bonus for me, them telling each other off if they think somebody is not doing it as well as they should be doing. \u201cAnd we also have a consistent performance level that has made me feel very confident about the team at the moment. It\u2019s just a frustration and disappointment that we haven\u2019t collected as many points as we should have done in the last few weeks.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
