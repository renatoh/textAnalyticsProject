The opening of the museum in 2014 was the realisation of a dream for Adamowicz, a Gda\u0144sk native who had long sought to present his city to the world as a symbol of Europe\u2019s hard-won freedom. In between shifts maintaining an overnight vigil by his coffin, researchers gathered materials with which to commemorate him. \u201cWe are working, we are making films, we are writing texts, but still I don\u2019t think we can accept that this situation is real,\u201d said Anna Mydlarska, head of the museum\u2019s documentary film section, ahead of Adamowicz\u2019s funeral on Saturday. She had first met him during a student strike in the late 1980s. \u201cI am working on all this material in which Pawe\u0142 Adamowicz is alive, and I can\u2019t fully accept and absorb the fact that he is now a part of history, a part of the past. People are so shaken, we feel orphaned.\u201d Gda\u0144sk remains in mourning for its mayor, who was stabbed on stage at a charity concert last Sunday evening and died the following day. On Saturday, the streets of its picturesque old town were filled for his funeral in the giant brick St Mary\u2019s Basilica. Black-and-white photos of Adamowicz hung in shop windows as mourners carrying flags of Gda\u0144sk and Pomerania watched the service on big screens outside. The murder of Adamowicz, a staunch defender of minority rights at a time of rising levels of hate crime and an ardent liberal critic of the ruling conservative party\u2019s anti-immigrant politics, has provoked an anguished and often ill-tempered national debate about hate speech and polarisation in Poland\u2019s deeply divided society. \u201cI am convinced that Pawe\u0142 would want me to say the following words,\u201d Dominican priest and anti-communist activist Ludwik Wi\u015bniewski declared in a powerful eulogy that drew applause from the congregation and the crowd outside. \u201cWe must end hate. We must end hate speech. We must end contempt. We must end baseless accusations against others.\u201d But as the debate surrounding the circumstances of Adamowicz\u2019s death continues, attention in Gda\u0144sk is also turning to the life, legacy and personality of a native son who served as its mayor for more than 20 years, transcending many of Poland\u2019s traditional political and cultural divisions. \u201cHe had unbelievable warmth \u2013 you could see the sympathy in his eyes,\u201d said Jerzy Limon, professor of English at the University of Gda\u0144sk, and a friend. \u201cHis love of the city was so strong, he was not one of those politicians who could just go anywhere. Gda\u0144sk was his beloved, and the city is his greatest monument.\u201d Adamowicz rose to prominence in 1988 as a law student at the University of Gda\u0144sk, where he led a student strike in solidarity with workers striking in the city\u2019s shipyard. \u201cIt was a period when people were tired of communism but they were also tired of fighting communism,\u201d recalled Wojciech Szel\u0105g, now a broadcaster, who participated in the strike. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a time of hope, it was a time you could paint only in grey. But I remember thinking that if people like Adamowicz were involved, it was worth it.\u201d \u201cHe stood out \u2013 not just physically, because he was very tall but because he wasn\u2019t the slightest bit aggressive,\u201d said Mydlarska. \u201cHe was always smiling and ready to joke. He spoke slowly. He liked to quote the motto of Gda\u0144sk: Nec temere, nec timide, \u2018neither rashly, nor timidly\u2019 \u2013 he loved that motto. He was part of the Gda\u0144sk tradition of courage without aggression.\u201d After the fall of communism, and still in his 20s, Adamowicz was elected to the city council in 1990, serving as head of the council from 1994 until his election as president of the city in 1998 at the age of 32. Those who knew and worked with him say his worldview was profoundly shaped by the experiences of his parents, who moved to Gda\u0144sk in the 1940s from Vilnius, now the capital of Lithuania, as part of a wave of Polish people expelled from territory seized by the Soviet Union in the aftermath of the second world war. As Adamowicz would later recount, they brought with them an outlook rooted in the multicultural traditions of Poland\u2019s eastern borderlands, which fitted perfectly with Gda\u0144sk\u2019s own history as a coastal trading city. \u201cFor most of its history, Gda\u0144sk was a multinational city, a kind of united Europe in miniature, where different nationalities lived together in peace \u2013 a wonderful historical example of openness and understanding, a city prepared to accept immigrants,\u201d said Limon, whose own family is also from Lithuania. \u201cWhen people came from eastern Poland and settled here, they somehow incorporated Gda\u0144sk\u2019s history into their own. Pawe\u0142\u2019s family was from the east, and he inherited this love of openness.\u201d Adamowicz worked closely with NGOs and civil society to establish mechanisms that would defend and uphold minority rights, with a particular focus on the integration of large numbers of migrants from the former Soviet Union, and his determination appeared to grow in the face of increasing anti-migrant sentiment associated with the rise to power of the Law and Justice party in 2015. A committed Catholic with a background in conservative politics, he frequently defended his robust stance on minority rights in religious terms, incensing many on the Polish right, including elements of the Polish Catholic church. \u201cIn this festive season, I will try to explain to my compatriots in Gda\u0144sk that the arrival of Christ was the very example of migration,\u201d he told a meeting of the European Committee of the Regions in December 2016. \u201cIt is very rare to challenge the church but it is even more rare to challenge the church on the basis of its own social teachings,\u201d said Marta Abramowicz, an LGBT activist and co-founder of Poland\u2019s Campaign Against Homophobia, who moved to Gda\u0144sk from Warsaw in 2010. \u201cHe didn\u2019t just support us, he supported us proudly and openly, he said that it was important that we were a part of Gda\u0144sk.\u201d \u201cHe was a religious conservative who was loved by the feminist movement \u2013 this is why he was extraordinary, and this is why we will miss him so much. We need politicians who say it\u2019s not leftist or communist to believe in human rights, it is just normal,\u201d said Marta Siciarek, director of Gda\u0144sk\u2019s Immigrant Support Centre, which was set up in 2012 with Adamowicz\u2019s support. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just talk, we had real challenges we needed to deal with. We had small children begging on the streets, and now the city is funding day care for them. But there is so much more we need to do, we still need him.\u201d At a time of acute partisan discord, the assassination of a man who so ostentatiously eschewed aggression while seeking to root progressive values in Poland\u2019s patriotic traditions \u2013 as illustrated by the mournful Arabic prayers sung by a representative of Gda\u0144sk\u2019s Muslim community in St Mary\u2019s Basilica during the funeral service \u2013 has only heightened people\u2019s grief and confusion. But in her eulogy, Adamowicz\u2019s widow, Magdalena, reminded the congregation of her late husband\u2019s last words. \u201cThis is a wonderful time to share what is good,\u201d he had told the crowd gathered at the charity concert just before the attack. \u201cYou are all so lovely, Gda\u0144sk is the most wonderful city in the world.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
