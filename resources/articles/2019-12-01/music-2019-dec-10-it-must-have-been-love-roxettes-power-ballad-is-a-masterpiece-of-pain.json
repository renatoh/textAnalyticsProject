It\u2019s certainly one of the biggest. The epic chorus \u2013 \u201cIt must have been love, but it\u2019s over now\u201d \u2013 is the sort of thing anyone can bellow, in an arena or the bath. When I saw Roxette in Manchester in 2012, the signature tune was the climax of the night, greeted with massed singing and beach balls in the audience. Frederiksson was already visibly \u2013 and occasionally audibly \u2013 frail, and yet seemed to summon up vast reserves of passion and emotion, which she poured into the Swedish band\u2019s biggest global hit. Ironically, for a song which has been ubiquitous on the radio and in clubs for over 30 years, It Must Have Been Love started life in 1987 as a Swedish-only Christmas single (subtitled Christmas for the Broken Hearted). EMI Germany had asked Roxette\u2019s songwriter Per Gessle for an \u201cintelligent Christmas single\u201d, but balked at releasing it internationally. In Sweden, it reached a more than respectable No 4, but it was inclusion in the 1990 romantic comedy Pretty Woman \u2013 starring Richard Gere and Julia Roberts \u2013 that saw it explode around the world, spend 14 weeks in the UK chart (reaching No 3) and propelled the soundtrack album to triple platinum status in the US. By the time Gessle submitted the song for consideration in the film, the duo had already scored two US No 1s. Meanwhile, perhaps crucially, It Must Have Been Love\u2019s intro and outro had been given crisper edits and the line \u201cIt\u2019s a hard Christmas day\u201d had been changed to \u201cIt\u2019s a hard winter\u2019s day\u201d, adding to the song\u2019s universal appeal. It has subsequently notched up five million radio plays and earned an astonishing half a billion dollars. Gessle, who as a child would sneak into his older brother\u2019s room to play the likes of the Animals\u2019 We Gotta Get Out of This Place and the Hollies\u2019 He Ain\u2019t Heavy, He\u2019s My Brother \u2013 drew on years of appreciation of the transformative power of epic pop, as well as Swedish folk. However, perhaps because of their trademark 80s look (big hair, PVC and eyeliner), gated snare drums and squeaky synths, Roxette were long dismissed as pop fluff. Few bands claimed them as a source of inspiration. Oft-compared, hardly dissimilar Australian duo Savage Garden even made a point of insisting they were not influenced by Roxette. Gessle was unfazed, pointing out \u201cin eight years, Abba never got a good review in Sweden\u201d, making a not-inappropriate comparison with that other Swedish pop sensation. As with Abba, jokes about Roxette\u2019s hairdos and outfits have latterly given way to a more reverential appreciation of their craft. The 28-or-so artists who have covered It Must Have Been Love range from this year\u2019s The X Factor: Celebrity winner Megan McKenna to Dame Shirley Bassey, and the tune powered its creators\u2019 2010 comeback arena tour. Roxette\u2019s reunion was prompted when \u2013 after years of illness and inactivity \u2013 Fredriksson turned up unexpectedly at a Gessle solo gig. She was low on confidence, but her singing moved the audience to tears. The song\u2019s endurance is perhaps down to something deeper than a beautiful voice and a big chorus. It follows the old Motown blueprint in perfectly blending ecstasy (musical) with agony (lyrical). It\u2019s a song about lost love, regret, and the feeling that the person singing it could \u2013 and should \u2013 have fought harder to keep the relationship alive. \u201cIt must have been good / but I lost it somehow\u201d \u2013 the brutally wry understatement in that line has the gallows humour of the truly devastated. It also suggests that maybe she couldn\u2019t have done anything, after all \u2013 baffled and alone, Fredriksson announces that love might never be understood. For all the wistful heartbreak, it\u2019s also necessary to move on \u2013 Fredriksson\u2019s genius is in delivering the title line clean and stoic, rather than with tortured vibrato, to show that she\u2019s resigned to her fate. But with the jarringly urgent upward key change in the middle eight, the pain floods in again, and she\u2019s back to square one. It Must Have Been Love brings such torrid feelings together in a perfect four minutes and 15 seconds. Marie Fredriksson is no longer here to sing it, but Roxette\u2019s signature song will never truly be over."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
