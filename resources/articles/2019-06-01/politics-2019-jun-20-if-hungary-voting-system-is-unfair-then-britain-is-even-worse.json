Maybe he could turn his spotlight on the UK, where in 2015 the Tories got 50.9% of the seats with just 36.9% of the vote, and Ukip got only one seat with over 12% of the vote? Time for a fairer electoral system for the UK, before we get called out by the EU for breaching article 2 of EU basic law. Oh! Too late \u2013 that boat may have sailed, it seems. Dave Beakhust Salisbury, Wiltshire \u2022 Apropos Timothy Garton Ash\u2019s acute analysis, just a few days ago J\u00e1nos B\u00e1k, the distinguished historian of medieval Hungary, celebrated his 90th birthday. His publication of the medieval laws of Hungary is a landmark equivalent to England\u2019s Magna Carta. Orb\u00e1n is unlikely to care a hoot about the rights and values embedded in medieval laws. Alas, his own regime represents one huge step backwards to an age way before those rights and values were thought of.
