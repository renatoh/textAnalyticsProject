However, your conclusions are disjointed and illogical. Paying workers higher wages in those areas will further encourage movement of people to already over-heated areas and deprive other areas of essential staff. These suggestions are capitalism at its worst. If a high tax was put on income from second houses rented out, they could still be owned but not profited on. John Corlett Doncaster S Yorks \u00b7 You missed one big point with regard to people not being able to afford to own houses in the south of England: there are not enough unskilled jobs or enough well-paid work in large parts of northern England where houses are affordable, and this forces more people south, pushing up prices. David Roberts Eastleigh Hants \u00b7 You suggest the way forward is to use public money to clear existing debt so that housing associations can take over from local councils and take on new debt more expensively. Why? The \u00a3900 million and \u00a3600m Treasury grants apparently available to pay off the historic housing debts of Birmingham and Glasgow councils would surely be better employed in direct housing investment? Lynne Jones MP London SW1 \u00b7 I fail to see a general solution to the growing housing crisis in the decision to privatise the housing stock in Glasgow. In fact, the trend away from local authority provision will in the long term exacerbate current problems. Tenants experiencing poor service from an under-funded council can hardly be blamed for such a choice made on the basis of the promise of repair and renewal, particularly after a multi-million pound propaganda exercise in support of the sell-off. But the economy of the madhouse is applied when the Government writes off the City's housing debt. Why, if they can write off the debt, could they not afford to fund the council adequately in the first place? Roger Bannister Kirkdale Liverpool \u00b7 'Locked out of London' (Focus, last week) highlighted the problems for public sector workers in finding affordable housing. Lots of us, however, are providing solutions. The Government has allocated \u00a3250 million pounds to help 10,000 key workers in the South-East to buy a home of their own close to their workplace, through the Starter Home Initiative. David Simmonds Director Northcote Housing Association London W13 \u00b7 You failed to mention the Tories' reluctance to allow councils to keep the money from the sale of council houses to replenish their stock. Nicholas Ridley was the Minister in charge at the time and, unfortunately, the chickens have come home to roost. J.V.
