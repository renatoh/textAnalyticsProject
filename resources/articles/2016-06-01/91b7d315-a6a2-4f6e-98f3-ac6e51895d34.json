It will now go on display to mark the museum\u2019s bicentenary. A glowing landscape framing a tender scene of the Adoration of the Shepherds, by the Italian Renaissance master Sebastiano del Piombo, has re-emerged from three centuries of overpainting, attempts to solve the original disastrous decision to lift it off the 16th century wooden panel and transfer it to canvas. \u201cEvery now and then our people would take a look at it and walk away again, sadly shaking their heads,\u201d said Rupert Featherstone, director of the Hamilton Kerr Institute, a world leader in conservation research and techniques. The painting was bought by the founder of the museum collection, the seventh Viscount Fitzwilliam of Merrion, who in 1816 left his fabulous collection of paintings, and \u00a3100,000, to found \u201ca good substantial museum\u201d. The museum is now one of the most renowned in the world, and the Fitzwilliam collection among its greatest treasures \u2013 but not the Adoration of the Shepherds, which he bought in Paris when the royal collection was broken up after the French revolution, thinking it was the work of the more famous Venetian painter Giorgione, Piombo\u2019s teacher. The painting, dated to 1510, may have already been in trouble, with the paint surface lifting, when it landed in the French royal collection in the 18th century, where the king\u2019s craftsmen specialised in transferring panel paintings to canvas. On smaller paintings it was sometimes possible to shave the surface of the board off, but on a large scale work such as this another piece of fabric was glued to the front of the painting, the whole picture peeled off, canvas glued to the back, and then the facing removed. Often it worked surprisingly well. Sometimes, as in this case, it was a disaster. The key to the restoration was analysing another version of the painting in the Louvre, which showed what the artist had originally intended, and minute analysis of the surviving original colours. This included a fabulously expensive blue for the Virgin\u2019s robe, which had been overpainted in pond slime green, revealing the complex layers the artist used to build up his glowing colours. \u201cWe can\u2019t work miracles,\u201d Featherstone said, \u201cbut a picture which was an absolute wreck is now a pleasure to look at again.\u201d The picture is now on display as object of the month at the Fitzwilliam."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
