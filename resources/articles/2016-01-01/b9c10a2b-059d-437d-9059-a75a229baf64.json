Savage explains: \u201cPace, posture, gesture and angle of the mask all have to express visually what isn\u2019t spoken. As a performer, you are anonymous. It\u2019s not a genre for actors with egos.\u201d At the end of this month, Vamos Theatre\u2019s latest production, The Best Thing, begins a 72-date tour around the country, starting with the 2016 London International Mime Festival. The play was triggered by an article I wrote in the Observer magazine three years ago about the plight of unmarried mothers in the 1950s and 1960s, forced to give their children up for adoption. Britain might have been \u201cswinging\u201d with the arrival of pop music, the sexual revolution and women\u2019s liberation, but a traditional moral code still applied for the girl who got herself \u201cinto trouble\u201d. \u201cWe still call women sluts and slags but where\u2019s the equivalent for men?\u201d asks Jean Robertson-Molloy, 79, a retired social worker. She travelled with me to Worcester from London to see the play in its final stages of rehearsal. In 1963, when she was in her twenties, she put her daughter, Amanda, up for adoption. Jean went on to marry and have two more children. In 1991, she traced Amanda. \u201cPeople talk about a reunion,\u201d Jean tells Rachael, \u201cbut it\u2019s really a first meeting.\u201d Amanda, married with children, came to England in 2010 from her home in Australia for a brief visit, but the two \u2013 at Amanda\u2019s request \u2013 have had little contact since. \u201cNowadays, birth without marriage is the norm but then it wasn\u2019t easy,\u201d says Jean. \u201cNo childcare and nobody to help. But still people say, \u2018How could you give your child away?\u2019 \u201d In 1968, the peak year for adoption, 16,164 children of unmarried mothers were adopted. Half a Million Women, an analysis that was published by the Post Adoption Centre in 1992, describes how unmarried mothers who fought to keep their children were seen as \u201cemotionally disturbed\u201d and a \u201cdiscredited person\u201d. The Best Thing is the culmination of two years of research conducted by Rachael, working in collaboration with the production\u2019s composer and script consultant, Janie Amour. \u201cThe title of the play comes from what many women were told when adoption was pressed on them,\u201d says Rachael. \u201cSo many were advised: \u2018It\u2019s the best thing for the baby. It\u2019s the best thing for you; sign here.\u2019 \u201d The play is an amalgamation of several true stories. While some adoptions were very successful, others were not. \u201cOne woman told me she had no sense of identity, as her adopted mother never gave her one. In this production, I use my family photos to show the importance of that longing for an identity,\u201d says Rachael. In the play, Susan is raised by her father, Bill. She has a boyfriend of two years, Dennis. Bill discovers Susan, 17, is pregnant and insists on adoption. It is 1966. The baby, Lisa, is adopted by a woman, \u201chighly critical, low warmth\u201d (represented in a fearsome mask), and Susan leaves home, never to be seen again by boyfriend or father. At Susan\u2019s funeral, Lisa, now in her forties, meets her grandfather for the first time. They are intrigued to find they share certain characteristics. Bill discovers that his granddaughter has been raised on the lie that her mother never wanted her. He acknowledges that \u2013 wrongly \u2013 he thought he\u2019d done the best thing. Jean sits and watches intently as a rehearsal, partly improvised, gets under way. The acting is powerful. \u201cI feel honoured that you are doing this,\u201d Jean tells Rachael at one point. Then the cast plays a scene in which two married mothers and Susan, unwed, give birth in the same labour ward. It is played comically and Jean is concerned. Later, she writes to Rachael: \u201cIt\u2019s a blooming cheek, from someone who knows nothing about mask theatre, but could you have one married woman cuddling her baby, being congratulated and hugged, surrounded by people, and Susan, alone, no baby, sitting very still and crying. That\u2019s what it was really like. The nurses in the labour ward left me alone for a very long time.\u201d Jean is a member of the Movement for an Adoption Apology, set up in 2010. It is an offshoot of the Natural Parents Network, of which Jean is also chair, that offers support to mothers often still affected decades later by secrecy and internalised shame. MAA wants the British government to issue an official apology as the then prime minister, Julia Gillard, did in Australia in 2013, announcing a national support fund for those women and their children who have paid a price. A group of women from MAA will see the play in London in two weeks. Among them is Helen Jeffreys. She became pregnant aged 17 in 1965 in Harrogate. \u201cI wanted to keep Adam,\u201d she said in the Observer article. \u201cMy social worker refused to help other than to facilitate adoption. When Adam was two months old I had to leave the mother-and-baby hostel. I was told if I had nowhere to go he must be placed for adoption. When I signed the paper, not one official asked me if that is what I wanted.\u201d Adam and Helen traced each other 29 years later and have remained close. \u201cI have underperformed for my entire life,\u201d Helen said. \u201cOn the day Adam was adopted \u2026 it was like a death sentence.\u201d Vamos Theatre, established in 2006, specialises in tackling challenging social issues, performing in theatres, schools, conferences, festivals and care homes. Finding Joy, a previous production, for instance, explored the impact of dementia on a family. \u201cSomething happens with the mask,\u201d Rachael says. \u201cWe have been told by experts on the illness that it\u2019s worth more than a dozen textbooks on a subject.\u201d She adds: \u201cWhen I read about what happened to unmarried mothers, I felt so angry. I had to do something. The Best Thing is the closest I can get to a personal apology. I hope it makes a difference.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
