Femi Elufowoju Jr, citing Wilson\u2019s words, defends his decision to feature a black family in Tennessee Williams\u2019s classic about sibling love and family dysfunction. There were landed black American families in the 1930s in which this play was set, he states, even those who owned their own slaves. In the light of this, the central mother\u2019s airs and graces, and her boasts of former beaux who were \u201cplanters on the Mississippi Delta\u201d take on revised meanings. Elufowoju Jr changes some of the language, too, but more generally, the heritage of this family seems to sit naturally and unobtrusively within the drama, even if this is pre-civil rights America and the \u201cgentleman caller\u201d who comes to dinner is white Irish. In fact, Elufowoju Jr\u2019s dramatisation is, beyond the central inversion, a faithful interpretation in its essence. Rebecca Brower\u2019s design reveals both the inside and outside of a tenement building in St Louis, and the mother \u2013 like so many of Williams\u2019s broken women \u2013 is the biggest, most mesmerising, presence on stage. Lesley Ewen plays the part with an almost exaggerated flamboyance, in both her bullying love towards her children and the excruciatingly coquettish southern charm she switches on for the gentleman caller. The siblings do not come alive quite so vividly. Naima Swaleh as the \u201ccrippled\u201d daughter, Laura, emanates a melancholy interiority, but her emotional vulnerabilities are not sufficiently animated and the impassivity ends up appearing wooden. Michael Abubakar plays the restless son, Tom, with gusto, but his performance is perhaps too amped-up from the start, and the play\u2019s quietly heart-wringing moments all but disappear. What also feels missing is the tenderness between Tom and Laura. There\u2019s not enough connection between the siblings, meaning the emotional tragedy between the two, on which the play\u2019s ending rests, is absent. The drama casts its spell nonetheless, bewitching us with its intensity and quiet torments. This is down partly to the poetry of Williams\u2019s script itself but also to the pace and tension created on stage, particularly in the romance between Laura and Jim O\u2019Connor, who Charlie Maher plays with the winning charm of a 1930s salesman. It is a heartfelt and engaging production, even if it feels surprisingly conventional in spite of its conceptual boldness. \u2022 At Arcola theatre, London, until 13 July."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
