Thank you for reading. Just shortly after Donald Trump undermined recommendations that Americans should wear masks, Melania Trump has urged people to \u201ctake social distancing &amp; wearing a mask/face covering seriously\u201d. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is now recommending Americans cover their faces when outside. But, at his daily press briefing, the US president Donald Trump said he would not be following the guidance. \u201cI\u2019m choosing not to do it,\u201d he said, repeatedly noting that wearing non-medical grade masks is a \u201cvoluntary\u201d option. Hello this is Rebecca Ratcliffe, taking over from Kevin Rawlinson. Here\u2019s a summary of the latest developments: Aleast 58,773 people across the world have now died as a result of the pandemic, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. The UK has endured its deadliest day so far, with 684 more people dying in UK hospitals. This brings the total number of UK fatalities to 3,605. The country\u2019s Department of Health and Social Care says 173,784 people have been tested; of whom 38,168 were positive. Americans should cover their faces when outside, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is recommending. But the US president Donald Trump has undermined the guidance, saying: \u201cI\u2019m choosing not to do it.\u201d Italy has recorded 766 more deaths, but the infection rate has continued to slow. Some 85,388 people are currently infected, with an increase of 2,339 new cases; 138 fewer than Thursday. The Falklands Islands has confirmed its first case. The patient has been hospitalised since 31 March and developed a range of Covid-19 symptoms, tested positive for the virus, and is now in a stable condition. The number of cases detected in Egypt jumped to 985, the country\u2019s health ministry said. A large-scale public inquiry into the UK response is now inevitable, a former head of the country\u2019s civil service has said. There are demands for better protection for the UK\u2019s healthcare workers following the deaths of two nurses in their 30s, while another frontline worker quit her job after being forbidden from wearing a face mask. Albania reported 27 new cases \u2013 its second biggest daily increase \u2013 and ordered a third 40-hour lockdown over the weekend. Police surrounded Geneva\u2019s main prison after some 40 prisoners refused to return to their cells from their daily walk, complaining about measures taken due to the pandemic. The daughter of a Dutch man, who died aboard a coronavirus-stricken cruise ship that docked in Florida Thursday after 12 days stranded at sea, says her family has been told it will be unable to recover his remains, Erin McCormick and Patrick Greenfield report. Angelique Slagmolen of the Netherlands, said her 72-year-old father Albert Slagmolen died after several days on a ventilator onboard the ship. But she said, after her family filled out forms to try to bring his remains home, they were informed matter of factly by officials in Florida that he would be cremated there. \u201cI don\u2019t even know where my dad is,\u201d said Slagmolen. She said she felt her father, who had several pre-existing conditions and was generally in poor health, had been well cared for aboard the ship. But the situation had turned into a nightmare for her family. \u201cIt\u2019s like a bad movie \u2013 and the movie is getting worse every day,\u201d she said. The Guardian has been contacted by the Broward County medical examiner about the issue who said there will not be a cremation without family approval. \u201cWe want him to go home as much as anyone else does,\u201d said Broward County Medical Examiner Craig Mallak. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Trump in response to a question asking where Dr Anthony Fauci is today. Fauci has not joined in the briefing today. \u201cWhenever he\u2019s not here,\u201d Trump complained, \u201cthe fake news\u201d will ask about him. You can follow our US-focused coronavirus coverage here: The masks are more for the protection of other people than oneself, the US surgeon general has clarified. Wearing a cloth face covering will help contain you coughs and sneezes, reducing chances that you\u2019ll spray infectious droplets into the air, and risk transmitting the disease the others. Still \u201cmaintaining six feet of social distancing remains key\u201d, he said. Masks are \u201cnot a replacement for social distancing\u201d. All Americans, including those without health insurance, will be able to receive treatment without worrying about the cost, according to the vice-president, Mike Pence. But it\u2019s unclear what provisions will be made to ensure that \u2014 the administration has repeatedly ignored calls from Democratic lawmakers to reopen the Obamacare exchanges to allow the uninsured to purchase insurance. Returning to Washington DC, here\u2019s more from the CDC: CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission. Health officials say the previous distancing and hygiene guidance remains in place. Equipment shortages within England\u2019s health service are such that one NHS trust has had to put out a call for donations on social media: Trump says he is directing the Federal Emergency Management Agency to prevent the export of N95 masks under the Defense Production Act. Earlier, the US was accused of \u201cmodern piracy\u201d after reportedly diverting a shipment of masks intended for the German police, and outbidding other countries in the increasingly fraught global market for coronavirus protective equipment. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is now recommending Americans cover their faces when outside, the White House says. But, at his daily press briefing, the US president Donald Trump has repeatedly undermined the guideline. \u201cI\u2019m choosing not to do it,\u201d he said, repeatedly noting that wearing non-medical grade masks is a \u201cvoluntary\u201d option. The Falkland Islands government has confirmed the island territory\u2019s first case. The patient has been hospitalised since 31 March and developed a range of Covid-19 symptoms, tested positive for the virus, and is now in a stable condition and being cared for with necessary isolation procedures. Demands for better protection for the UK\u2019s healthcare workers are growing following the death of two nurses in their 30s, while another frontline worker quit her job after being forbidden from wearing a face mask, Haroon Siddique, Nazia Parveen and Alexandra Topping write. Areema Nasreen, 36, died shortly after midnight on Friday at Walsall Manor hospital in the West Midlands, where she had worked for 16 years. Aimee O\u2019Rourke, 38, who joined the NHS in 2017 and worked at Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother hospital in Margate, Kent, died hours earlier, on Thursday night. Both were mothers of three children. Two NHS healthcare assistants have also died. The family of Thomas Harvey, 57, who worked in north-east London, believe he would still be alive today if he had been given proper personal protective equipment (PPE), they told Sky News. The number of cases detected in Egypt has jumped by more than 100 for the first time, bringing total infections to 985, the country\u2019s health ministry has said. It announced that 120 new cases and eight more deaths have been recorded. That brought the total number of deaths to 66. Egyptian officials have said that once the number of known infections surpasses 1,000, the task of tracing contacts and quarantining those affected would become harder. The prime minister, Mostafa Madbouly, has said the next week will be critical in Egypt\u2019s efforts to contain the illness. UK biomedical scientists and National Health Service laboratory staff have expressed \u201cfrustration\u201d at a lack of resources preventing them from carrying out larger numbers of tests. On Thursday, the country\u2019s health secretary Matt Hancock committed to raising testing numbers to 100,000 a day by the end of April. But the Institute of Biomedical Science has said: The UK has numerous high-quality accredited laboratories with suitable equipment, with the capability to process over 100,000 tests per day, set up and ready to meet testing targets. Staffing levels are currently adequate to expand Covid-19 testing. Biomedical scientists across the UK have already been re-trained to carry out testing or free up virology-trained staff to focus on testing. Currently, England could process up to 25,000 a day, which by May could rise to 100,000, meeting the ambitious target set down by Matt Hancock, all within the NHS. However, there is a material supply issue with a worldwide shortage in reagent kits. The supply of precision plastics that are used with the reagents are not due to be ready until mid-May. Police have surrounded Geneva\u2019s main prison after some 40 prisoners refused to return to their cells from their daily walk, complaining about measures taken due to the pandemic. Laurent Forestier, the spokesman for prisons in Geneva, has said: There was a refusal to go back to their cells. At the end of the afternoon, the prisoners who were finishing their walk inside the prison refused to go back to their cells Discussions are continuing and it\u2019s not over yet. There has been one confirmed infection in the facility, Forestier said, adding that the person had been hospitalised. French-language Swiss broadcaster RTS said on Twitter that police have surrounded the area. The chronically-overcrowded Champ-Dollon prison, located in the Geneva countryside, was built for 400 inmates but had some 600 last month, the daily Le Temps said. Muhammad Siddique, the father of my Guardian colleague Haroon Siddique, died last week after being hospitalised with coronavirus symptoms. Haroon has written this beautiful obituary in his father\u2019s memory: Albania has reported 27 new cases \u2013 its second biggest daily surge \u2013 and ordered a third 40-hour lockdown over the weekend to halt the spread of the highly contagious pathogen that has killed 17 in the country so far. Albania had reported its largest single day of confirmed cases on March 26 with 28. After declaring the pandemic a natural calamity, Albania extended the shutdown of any activity, its borders, businesses and transport, except for a few essential industries during an eight-hour daily window. Telecoms engineers are facing verbal and physical threats during the lockdown, as baseless conspiracy theories linking coronavirus to the roll-out of 5G technology spread by celebrities such as Amanda Holden prompt members of the public to abuse those maintaining vital mobile phone and broadband networks. Warehouse workers for the fast fashion brands Pretty Little Thing and Boo Hoo are begging consumers to stop ordering non-essential items such as \u00a36 boob tubes and \u00a38 false eyelashes after orders at one depot more than tripled in a week, Helen Pidd and Amy Walker write. Morale is said to be \u201crock bottom\u201d at Pretty Little Thing\u2019s fulfilment centre in Tinsley, Sheffield, where workers doing 12-hour shifts said they were processing orders for 400,000 items this week, up from 120,000 in a \u201cnormal\u201d week. They also complain it is \u201cpractically impossible\u201d for hundreds of staff on each shift to keep two metres apart and still meet their hourly targets of picking 80 items. They also clock on using an unhygienic fingerprint scanner, though Pretty Little Thing (PLT) says a staff member thoroughly wipes the equipment after every use. The work of the Reuters news agency in Iraq has been suspended for three months after the outlet reported that the country\u2019s government was underreporting confirmed cases. Reuters was also fined 25 million Iraqi dinars (about \u00a317,000 or $20,800), according to a statement posted on the official Communication and Media Commission website. The Reuters story cited multiple sources who said the government was vastly misreporting cases of coronavirus in the country, saying the true number of those infected was in the thousands. The country\u2019s health ministry said on Friday there were 820 confirmed cases and 54 deaths. The Reuters report said the true number ranged from 3,000 to 9,000. Reuters said it has not received any notification from Iraqi authorities regarding their license and were seeking clarification on the matter. The agency said it stood by its report. The scale of the coronavirus outbreak and the response it has required from the UK government means a large-scale public inquiry is now inevitable, a former head of the country\u2019s civil service has said. Sir Bob Kerslake said the scope of the decision-making undertaken by politicians and officials had been vast, and, as some of it had already been challenged, there would need to be a chance to reflect upon the UK\u2019s response in case of another pandemic. There will need to be some sort of inquiry after we get through this to learn lessons. This is one where we might face the same situation again. I hope that even during this clear crisis moment there is a proper record being kept of who made decisions and why, because that will be very, very important. Not to lay blame \u2013 though clearly there will be a bit of that \u2013 but to plan for the future. We could face this again and it could be even worse. Disney is delaying the release of upcoming films because of the pandemic. The action epic \u201cMulan\u201d will come out in July and Marvel\u2019s \u201cBlack Widow\u201d will be available in November. Among other changes, Disney postponed the release of a new \u201cIndiana Jones\u201d film by one year to July 2022. The UK government\u2019s pledge to carry out 100,000 tests per day by the end of the month is \u201crealistic\u201d, Public Health England\u2019s director of public health improvement has said. Prof John Newton has told Channel 4 News: It is realistic. We have some really good progress. We\u2019re using tried and tested technology, this is not innovation \u2013 it\u2019s massive, industrial-scale rollout of these three big mega-labs in Milton Keynes, Manchester and Glasgow. And they are already delivering tests \u2013 many thousands of tests a day \u2013 and we are really looking forward to seeing that number go up soon. The number of funerals in Jakarta rose sharply in March, a development the governor of Indonesia\u2019s capital city said suggested that deaths from the new coronavirus may be higher than officially reported. Nearly 4,400 burials occurred in the month; 40% higher than any month since at least January 2018, according to a Reuters review of statistics from the city\u2019s Department of Parks and Cemeteries. Jakarta\u2019s governor, Anies Baswedan, and some public health experts suspect the number of infections and deaths in Jakarta has been significantly under-reported due to one of the world\u2019s lowest rates of testing. It is extremely disturbing. I\u2019m struggling to find another reason than unreported Covid-19 deaths. Known global death toll passes 55,000. At least 55,781 people across the world have now died as a result of the pandemic, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. The number of confirmed cases passed a million on Thursday and at least 1,056,777 people are now known to have been infected. The true scale of the outbreak is likely to be greater due to suspected underreporting by some nations. UK endures deadliest day so far. It is confirmed that 684 more people have died in UK hospitals, bringing the total to 3,605 and making the 24 hours to 5pm on Thursday (BST) the deadliest since the outbreak began. The country\u2019s Department of Health and Social Care says 173,784 people have been tested; of whom 38,168 were positive. New York reports nearly 3,000 deaths. The state\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, announcesd that 2,935 people have now died. The toll, up from from 2,373 a day earlier, represents the highest single-day rise since the coronavirus crisis struck. There are 102,863 confirmed cases in New York. Cuomo said that hospitals havein effect turned into ICU hospitals for Covid-19 patients. Italy records 766 more deaths \u2013 but infection rate slows. The number of deaths on Friday was relatively steady, when compared to those seen the previous day. But new infections continue to slow down, raising hopes of turnaround. Some 85,388 people are currently infected, with an increase of 2,339 new cases; 138 fewer than Thursday. Italy remains the world\u2019s worst-hit country, having suffered a total of 14,681 deaths. More than 250,000 EU citizens stranded abroad. Some 350,000 have been repatriated but that still leaves a quarter of a million EU citizens trying to get home. Josep Borrell, the bloc\u2019s foreign policy chief, says operations are under way to retrieve them. But he adds: \u201cOne could not imagine that there are so many Europeans stranded in the world: tourists; visitors; short-term workers.\u201d Swiss death toll rises to 484. The Swiss government announced an increase in the number of deaths, adding that the number of positive cases now stands at 19,903. Switzerland has closed schools and many businesses, as well as banning gatherings of more than five people. WHO said countries must avoid a cycle of lockdown, relaxation, and further lockdown. The organisation called on countries to develop a just transition strategy that gets them in control of the virus. English Premier League asks players to take 30% wage cut. Premier League clubs announce they are \u201ccommitting \u00a320m to support the NHS, communities, families and vulnerable groups during the pandemic\u201d. While older people are more likely to die if they contract coronavirus, evidence continues to show that younger people are also being severely impacted. Dr David Hepburn, ICU consultant at Newport\u2019s Royal Gwent hospital in south Wales, has said all the patients there are under-50. Speaking to Channel 4 News, he said: The pattern of illness that we\u2019ve seen in Gwent, and I can\u2019t speak for anywhere else, is much younger patients than we were expecting. When the reports started coming out of Wuhan, we were led to believe that this was something that was particularly dangerous for the more elderly patients but I would say all the patients we\u2019ve got an intensive care are in their 50s or younger at the moment. Our youngest patient is in her early 20s. And there are, you know, there are patients who are very well, you know, a chap who\u2019s a fitness professional but you know there are a lot of patients who are not, do not have any pre-existing medical conditions. They\u2019re not diabetic or anything like that. We\u2019ve got 16 ventilated patients in the intensive care unit at the minute, which has led us to completely run out of space. So we\u2019ve taken over theatre recovery, and we\u2019ve got a further eight there. I think by the end of today, we will fill recovery. So that\u2019ll bring us up to 25 patients. And then we have another area prepared, which is the old high dependency unit and coronary care that we\u2019ve taken over as well. We can fit a further 22 patients in that area. The way things are going at the minute, the rate of growth and the amount of admissions that we\u2019re seeing, I would say we will fill that by the end of the week, probably. The WHO briefing ends with Georgieva saying the world will get through the epidemic, but how quickly that happens depends on the actions that countries take now. Adhanom added that \u201cboth lives and livelihoods matter\u201d. When asked about the effectiveness of using masks, Ryan said there is a very healthy debate going on. He said countries must prioritise giving surgical and medical masks for healthcare workers. WHO already advises that people use medical masks for people who are ill at home and people caring for people at sick at home. He added the evidence suggests that wearing a mask in public doesn\u2019t necessarily protect someone, but it can be of use to someone who is experiencing symptoms and thus reduce the rate that an infected individual infects others. WHO said countries need a transition strategy that gets them in control of the virus. Countries need to avoid a cycle of lockdown, relaxation of rules, followed by a further lockdown. Ryan said WHO has repeatedly warned that young people are also at risk from this virus. He said even in South Korea, which has managed to control the disease, one in six deaths have been of people under 60. In Italy, over the last six weeks, at least 10-15% of people in intensive care have been under 50, Ryan explained. Ryan said: It\u2019s not that anything has changed. It\u2019s that we collectively have been living in a world where we\u2019ve tried to convince ourselves that this disease is mild in the young people and it\u2019s more severe in older people and that\u2019s where the problem is. I think the evidence has been there all along that there is a spectrum of severity and its definitely more severe in older age groups, but there is a spectrum of severity in younger people as well. When asked what WHO\u2019s stance is on antibody testing and immunity passports, Dr Maria Van Kerkhove said WHO is \u201cworking with a number of countries that are looking into the use of serologic assays in the form of research.\u201d The test will estimate the antibody levels in populations in a country. She added it is a positive sign that there are a number of tests being rapidly developed. The IMF has been asked whether it would grant debt relief to African nations where citizens who are following social distancing guidelines are now more worried about dying from hunger than the coronavirus. IMF\u2019s Kristalina Georgieva said it\u2019s important to provide significant financial support to African countries. She said the board approved emergency finances for Rwanda and two more African countries are in discussion for approval today. The briefing has now moved to questions from journalists. The first question asked if there is anything in the diet, lifestyle or drug protocol that Americans or Europeans use that make this virus more severe Dr Michael J Ryan, executive director of the WHO\u2019s health emergencies programme, said the evidence so far would indicate that antihypertensive drugs that many people are on does not have any impact on the severity of the disease. The difference in mortality rates between countries could be down to the age profile of the country, some have a higher population of older populations, and the presence of underlying conditions. Italy registered 766 more deaths from Covid-19 on Friday - 6 more than Thursday - and remains the country worst affected by the outbreak with a total of 14,681 deaths. However, new infections continue to slow down, raising hopes of turnaround. Some 85.388 are currently infected with an increase of 2339 new cases, 138 less than Thursday. Some 1.480 have recovered in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number to 19.758. In total, 119.827 people have tested positive with coronavirus in Italy, including people who have died, recovered and the ones who are currently infected. Lockdown in the country could be extended until May 1 and \u2018phase two\u2019 of living with the virus can begin in mid-May, Emergency Commissioner Angelo Borrelli said Friday. The government has officially extended the coronavirus lockdown until Easter in mid-April, but Borrelli stressed the importance of keeping to \u201cthe most rigorous conduct in observing lockdown rules\u2019\u2019. \u2018\u2019The date of emerging from lockdown is still not certain at all\u201d, Borrelli added. In the meantime, 77 health workers in Italy have died from coronavirus since the outbreak there began, as medics work relentlessly to try to turn the tide in Europe\u2019s worst-affected country. The majority were on the frontline in the badly affected northern regions and contracted the illness at the start of the outbreak when protective equipment was lacking. Adhanom said almost $690 million has now been pledged or received since it asked for support nearly two months ago Tedros Adhanom, WHO\u2019s director general, is leading a press conference on the coronavirus. He has called for countries to provide free care and testing for covid-19, regardless of a person\u2019s insurance, citizenship or residency status. \u201cThis is an unprecedented crisis which requires an unprecedented response,\u201d he said. Adhanom added that country\u2019s should consider using cash transfers for the most vulnerable households.suspend Ontario has been lagging behind other Canadian provinces in testing for coronavirus because in the early weeks of the outbreak its public labs relied heavily on a single company for needed chemicals, Reuters reports. There are thought to be thousands of backlogged cases in Ontario, Canada\u2019s most heavily populated region. The province is focused on ramping testing back up, particularly for healthcare workers. As of Wednesday, Ontario had tested 4,188 per million residents, less than every Canadian province except New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, which have far fewer cases. Alberta had tested 11,139 per million, and Quebec 8,216 per million. The provincial public health agency\u2019s labs were heavily dependent on one company\u2019s system to extract RNA, the virus\u2019s genetic material, the agency told Reuters. Hundreds of US citizens have been stranded in Moscow after an evacuation flight to New York was grounded at the last moment due to a Russian ban on all international flights. The Aeroflot flight was meant to carry US citizens seeking to leave Russia, and then repatriate hundreds of Russians stranded in the US. Russia has closed its international borders for most travellers, and this afternoon announced it would impose a ban on all international flights in and out of Russia as of Saturday morning. The cancellation came after passengers had already boarded the flight. Some had been trying to leave Russia for weeks. Others had been living in Moscow\u2019s Sheremetyevo airport for days, waiting for a chance to leave the country. Nicholas Mackay, a ballet photographer who lives in Russia, said that he has been trying to travel to the US for several weeks to reach his father, who has cancer. \u201cWe were already on the flight, and then a flight attendant came on over the intercom and told us that we are not flying out, the flight is cancelled and all flights are cancelled by the Russian government,\u201d he said by telephone. \u201cThere\u2019s no information. We\u2019re not even able to get any money back from our flight. We\u2019re only able to change for a different day. A different day is no day, because no one knows when international travel will be OK in this whole situation.\u201d A video uploaded by his brother, Julian, showed angry passengers reacting to the flight cancellation. \u201cIt\u2019s chaos,\u201d he said. A US embassy spokesperson said: \u201cThe US embassy is aware of the inexplicable cancellation of today\u2019s Aeroflot flight to New York. The flight was full of US citizens anxious to get home. We are awaiting an explanation from the Russian Federation. We continue to work to find ways to help US citizens return home.\u201d Canada has recorded almost 12,000 cases of coronavirus, according to the country\u2019s public health agency. The death toll increased to 152 on Friday. Quebec, which has 5,518 confirmed cases as of Friday, is the country\u2019s worst affected region, followed by Ontario, with 3,255 confirmed cases. The Spanish government has said it is working to roll out some form of guaranteed income that could benefit as many as 5 million people as the country reels from the coronavirus epidemic. \u201cWe\u2019re working on a minimum income,\u201d the country\u2019s labour minister, Yolanda D\u00edaz, said on Friday. \u201cWe need it now more than ever.\u201d Spain has emerged as one of the world\u2019s hardest-hit countries, with the virus claiming 10,935 lives. More than 117,000 people have tested positive for Covid-19. The rapid spread of the virus has decimated the country\u2019s tourism industry \u2013 which accounts for nearly 12% of the country\u2019s GDP \u2013 while the near-total lockdown has shuttered bars, restaurants and non-essential shops and halted construction. Nearly 900,000 workers have lost their jobs since the lockdown began on 14 March, while another 620,000 people have been temporarily laid off, government data showed this week, sparking worry in a country where the unemployment rate already ranks among the highest in the Eurozone. \u201cThe data is extraordinary,\u201d the social security minister, Jos\u00e9 Luis Escriv\u00e1, said on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented.\u201d The government has announced a series of measures aimed at softening the blow of the epidemic, including a moratorium on mortgages payments and the suspension of evictions for those affected by the crisis. The minimum income is aimed at complementing these measures, D\u00edaz, the labour minister, told the Spanish broadcaster Cadena Ser, as it will provide protection for vulnerable residents not served by other government measures. She declined to provide more details or a timeline for the measure. The death toll in New York from the coronavirus has jumped to 2,935, governor Andrew Cuomo announced. The death toll, which is up from from 2,373 a day earlier, represented the highest single-day rise since the coronavirus crisis struck the state. There are 102,863 confirmed cases of coronavirus in New York. Cuomo said that hospitals have effectively turned into ICU hospitals for Covid-19 patients. The prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda has written to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to call for debt relief for his country and other small economies hit suffering economic crises caused by the coronavirus outbreak. In a two-page letter published on Thursday to his Facebook page, Gaston Browne, who also finance minister of the Caribbean nation, said that the crisis had already led to the loss of a fifth of GDP, and was only likely to get worse. With airlines grounded, cruise ships berthed and hotels closed in an effort to curb the international spread of the coronavirus, the tourism industry in the region had ceased and governments had taken a huge hit to revenue, Browne said. \u201cAll of this translates into very high unemployment, and an increase in poverty levels that, inevitably, will spur more and varied crime \u2013 drug trafficking, probably becoming rampant\u201d He pointed out that his country and others in the region are trying to battle outbreaks at the same time as preparing what is forecast to be an \u201cabove average\u201d hurricane season, with as many as four major hurricanes expected. \u201cIn the region\u2019s already precarious state, the effects of a hurricane would be catastrophic.\u201d Slovenia will introduce a mandatory 14-day quarantine for most people entering the country from Saturday, Reuters reports. The quarantine will apply to both Slovenian citizens and foreign nationals, the government said on Friday. The penalty for those flouting the decree will be 400 euros ($430), the government said. The new rule will not apply to people who have to travel to the country for work and will not include those involved in cargo traffic or who are passing through Slovenia on their way to another country without staying overnight. Last month, Slovenia closed all schools, bars, restaurants, hotels, sports centres, cultural institutions and shops, except food and drug stores. It has also shut down all public transport. Slovenia has confirmed 934 coronavirus cases and 20 deaths. Premier League players will be asked to take a 30% drop in their wages, via cuts or deferrals or both, in response to the coronavirus pandemic, the clubs agreed at a meeting on Friday. The move came as the 20 top-flight teams said they would give \u00a3125m to the EFL and National League to help their clubs through the crisis and donate \u00a320m to support the NHS, communities, families and vulnerable groups. A Premier League statement said: \u201cIn the face of substantial and continuing losses for the 2019-20 season since the suspension of matches began, and to protect employment throughout the professional game, Premier League clubs unanimously agreed to consult their players regarding a combination of conditional reductions and deferrals amounting to 30% of total annual remuneration.\u201d More than 250,000 European Union citizens are still trying to get home after the EU has repatriated some 350,000 people, Reuters reports. \u201cWe have brought home 350,000 Europeans but there are still 250,000 remaining and many operations are under way,\u201d Josep Borrell, the EU\u2019s foreign policy chief told reporters. \u201cOne could not imagine that there are so many Europeans stranded in the world: tourists, visitors, short-term workers. We are not talking about permanent residents,\u201d Borrell added. With a mix of chartered and military planes, EU institutions are helping member states cover the costs of repatriation on flights with passengers of more than one EU country. How has coronavirus affected global air traffic? Niko Kommenda, the Guardian\u2019s visual projects editor, analysed the data and found thousands of planes are still in the air despite the mass cancellation of flights. French police have increased checks at train stations and motorways on Friday to stop people breaking a national lockdown ahead of school holidays this weekend. Reuters reports 5,307 people have died from the coronavirus in France. Almost 60,000 people there been diagnosed with the illness, and almost 6,400 are on life-support machines, which has put the health system under pressure and overwhelmed hospitals in the Paris and eastern regions. The number of people entering intensive care units has fallen over the last three days and the daily death toll in hospitals stabilised after the government imposed a lockdown on the country\u2019s 67 million population on 17 March, which was extended until 15 April. The government of Jersey has announced a plan to test every citizen for Covid-19 in a programme to be rolled out over the coming weeks. The British crown dependency says it has ordered up to 150,000 antibody test kits which are due to arrive in batches. Known as serology tests, they measure the presence of antibodies in the blood which are known to be produced by those who have already contracted the virus. Jersey went into lockdown on Monday and 96 islanders have so far tested positive. Frontline staff and key workers will be tested first, in order to check whether they have had the disease and therefore potentially gained immunity, meaning they can return to work. The scheme will then be rolled out to other islanders. The first delivery is due by the middle of April. Government medical officer Dr Ivan Muscat said arrangements for expanding testing into the community may involve sending out mobile testing units. \u201cObviously, we would be very interested in working out who is infected and who isn\u2019t,\u201d said Muscat at a press conference, \u201cin order to determine what someone\u2019s diagnosis is and where they\u2019re looked after if they\u2019re admitted to hospital, for example.\u201d Fellow crown dependency the Isle of Man has taken a different approach, choosing to align with UK government advice, which is that antibody test kits are not reliable enough for widespread use in the community. \u201cThe latest advice I\u2019ve received is that so far they are only 30% reliable,\u201d first minister Howard Quayle told the island\u2019s parliament Friday. \u201cWe are obviously watching this and when our medics feel that the test is reliable \u2026 then of course we will be looking to implement that on the Isle of Man too.\u201d Ireland has had a more than fourfold increase in coronavirus outbreaks in nursing homes in the space of a week, Reuters reports. The rate of increase in infections has more than halved across the country since the government implemented restrictions in mid-March. Despite these restrictions, the number of nursing homes reporting clusters of cases rose to 38 from nine from 24-31 March, according to the most recent data released on Friday from Ireland\u2019s health service executive (HSE). \u201cA manifestation of where Covid-19 is at the moment is that the health now of those who are in our nursing homes is a matter of real concern for the government,\u201d the finance minister, Paschal Donohoe, told reporters. \u201cWe are looking at the moment at what additional measures need to be put in place in nursing home environments.\u201d The global scramble to source protective equipment is heating up, Kim Willsher and Oliver Holmes reports. Val\u00e9rie Pecresse, the influential president of the \u00cele-de-France region, which includes Paris, described the race to get hold of masks as a \u201ctreasure hunt\u201d. Pecresse said: I found a stock of masks that was available and Americans \u2013 I\u2019m not talking about the American government \u2013 but Americans, outbid us. They offered three times the price and they proposed to pay upfront. I can\u2019t do that. I\u2019m spending taxpayers\u2019 money and I can only pay on delivery having checked the quality. So we were caught out. About 90% of Americans are under stay-at-home orders as the US tries to get a handle of the rapid spread of coronavirus by enforcing social distancing guidelines. But there are still frustrations with the handful of governors who are resisting issuing statewide orders. The US reported 1,169 coronavirus deaths on Thursday, the highest one-day death toll of any country so far. My colleague Joan Greve is now liveblogging all US-related coronavirus news. A coalition of governments and research institutions from 30 countries has been launched to work on tackling Covid-19 in lower-income countries. The 70 institutions signed up said states with limited resources are being forgotten in the pandemic response, and that very few related clinical trials had been planned for poorer countries despite their wealth of expertise. They called for greater coordination of research efforts in Africa, Latin America, Asia and eastern Europe. \u201cThe more players we have in research and development, the more rich it will be,\u201d said Jean-Michel Piedagnel, the south-east Asia director for the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative, one of the 70. \u201cYou will develop treatment options that are more aligned with the needs of the country and with the means of the country. If you do your clinical trial in a setting where healthcare is underfunded or resource-poor, you will do a different clinical trial, you will do a different treatment.\u201d The World Health Organization\u2019s chief scientist, Dr Soumya Swaminathan, said the initiative would help coordinate a global response. \u201cWe must prepare now for the consequences of this pandemic in more resource-constrained settings or we stand to lose many more lives,\u201d she said. Evans Amukoye, the director of scientific programmes at the Kenya Medical Research Institute, said in the past treatments were often beyond the means of poorer countries. \u201cA lot of people had died before it became accessible. If you look at some diseases you see that where there is no profit there is no investment,\u201d said Amukoye. Russia will suspend all flights bringing Russians home from abroad from Friday night, reports the Interfax news agency. The announcement was made with no explanation. The foreign ministry said on Wednesday that 25,000 Russians abroad had appealed for help getting home, with many still stranded as measures to curb the spread of coronavirus have limited travel options. The UK has endured its deadliest day of the coronavirus pandemic, with 569 fatalities recorded in 24 hours. As Downing Street comes under mounting pressure over its perceived failure to accelerate nationwide testing to combat the virus, the country\u2019s Covid-19 death toll continues to rise. A total of 2,921 people had died in hospitals after testing positive for the disease as of 5pm on Wednesday, representing a slightly bigger increase than the previous day, when there were 563 deaths. Don\u2019t forget, you can also follow our UK coronavirus blog: Russian police have detained a doctors\u2019 rights activist who has been highly critical of the Kremlin\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Anastasia Vasiliyeva, the head of the opposition-leaning Alliance of Doctors union, was detained with other activists last night while attempting to deliver medical equipment in Russia\u2019s Novgorod region. Video of the incident showed Vasiliyeva being dragged into a local police station by police officers and other men in medical masks. In a post, the organisation said Vasiliyeva lost consciousness during the arrest, possibly because she was choked. She is still in custody as of Friday afternoon and has reportedly received citations for violating mandatory quarantine measures and for resisting police orders. Vasiliyeva and the Alliance of Doctors have been highly critical of the government\u2019s preparations for the coronavirus outbreak, accusing the government of faking official statistics about the number of coronavirus cases in Russia and blasting the government for failing to equip hospitals with needed medical supplies. The group had also criticised the government\u2019s airlift of medical equipment and ventilators to the US. \u201cWell, great,\u201d the group wrote. \u201cWe raise money all over the country to buy medical protective equipment, and our government sells PPE to the USA. It\u2019s a mockery.\u201d Greta Thunberg, the 17-year-old Swedish activist who inspired the global school climate strikes, posted a picture of herself striking at home. Last week, Thunberg said in a post on Instagram that she had self-isolated after she and her father returned from a trip around central Europe about two weeks ago. The Swiss government is doubling the size of its coronavirus emergency loan scheme to 40bn Swiss francs ($40.94bn), Reuters reports. The government said on Friday it was inundated by requests for help by businesses and would be expanding bridging loan guarantees from an initial 20bn francs after banks made loans of 14.3bn francs in the first few days of the scheme. So far, more than 76,000 agreements have been made, the government said. The Swiss death toll from coronavirus rose to 484, from 432 on Thursday, while the number of positive tests rose to 19,303. Hi, I\u2019m Aamna taking over the liveblog from my colleague Ben. If you want to get in touch, you can email me (aamna.mohdin@theguardian.com) or tweet at me. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, said on Friday he was remaining in isolation with mild symptoms of the coronavirus, including a high temperature, seven days after he first tested positive. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m feeling better and I\u2019ve done my seven days of isolation, alas I still have one of the symptoms, a minor symptom, I still have a temperature,\u201d Johnson said in a video message posted on Twitter. \u201cSo in accordance with government advice I must continue my self isolation until that symptom itself goes.\u201d Johnson announced a week ago that he had tested positive and would be isolating in Downing Street. In his address, the prime minister told Britons that they needed to stick to the rules on staying at home unless it was essential to go out, ahead of a weekend when good weather is forecast. \u201cI just urge you not to do that (go out). Please, please stick with the guidance now,\u201d he said. \u201cThis country has made a huge effort, a huge sacrifice, done absolutely brilliantly well in delaying the spread of the virus. Let\u2019s stick with it now.\u201d When asked earlier on Friday if Johnson would be out of isolation on Friday, his health minister, Matt Hancock, said: \u201cI\u2019ve absolutely no idea but what I do know is he\u2019s still working.\u201d Hancock tested positive for coronavirus last week at about the same time as Johnson, but he has since left isolation and is working as scheduled. A drive-through coronavirus screening centre in the UAE capital Abu Dhabi has become a go-to destination for many wanting reassurance during the pandemic. The facility, believed to be the first of its kind in the Gulf, greets around 600 people a day in the 12 hours it is in service. The test is free for the elderly, pregnant women and anyone showing symptoms of Covid-19. Others can get tested for 370 dirhams ($100). A nurse approaches the car to take the passengers\u2019 temperatures and then takes a nasal swab - a five-minute procedure. \u201cIt is safer than going to the hospital, which is scary these days, especially for children,\u201d said Mohammed Abdullah al-Thahnani, who took his family to get tested after a 14-day quarantine upon arriving from abroad. French high-school school students will not sit the traditional baccalaur\u00e9at (bac) exam this summer due to the coronavirus, the education minister has said, an unprecedented move that highlights the scale of disruption caused by the pandemic. It is the first time since its inception in 1808 under Napoleon Bonaparte that the \u2018bac\u2019 exam will not take place in its traditional form. Even the sweeping student and labour protests of May 1968 did not prevent the exam going ahead. In the UK, Prince Charles opened a new 4,000-bed temporary hospital in a conference centre in east London, the first of several being built in Britain to deal with the coronavirus outbreak. The new state-run National Health Service (NHS) hospital is named after the trailblazing 19th-century nurse Florence Nightingale and has been built in just nine days. NHS Nightingale London will initially take 500 people in the coming days, said the health secretary, Matt Hancock, who has also tested positive for Covid-19. It will take intensive care patients with Covid-19 from other London hospitals, which have had the highest number of cases across Britain. There are initial signs that the trend in new coronavirus infections in Germany is flattening off, the health minister, Jens Spahn, said on Friday. Speaking during a visit to a logistics company involved in distributing supplies of medical protection equipment, Spahn said Germany had already obtained 1,500 new ventilators \u2013 essential to treating patients with acute cases of the novel coronavirus \u2013 and added that these would be in clinics by April. Efforts to boost the number of intensive care beds available in recent days had resulted in 40% of them being free to receive patients, Spahn said. China\u2019s central bank said on Friday it would cut the reserve requirements for smaller banks to release around 400bn yuan ($56.3bn) in liquidity, a move to counter the coronavirus impact on enterprises. The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) said in a statement it will also slash the interest it pays on financial institutions\u2019 excess reserves for the first time in 12 years, to encourage them to use the cash rather than store it with the central bank. New registrations of cars on German roads plunged in March to its lowest in almost three decades, data shows, as restrictions to slow the spread of the coronavirus inflicted a heavy blow. Sales tumbled 38% year-on-year to just over 215,100 according to data from the KBA vehicle licensing authority. \u201cNecessary health policy measures, like the massive limits on public life, closure of car dealerships and limited ability to work in the licensing offices\u201d had put the brake on the car trade, the VDA carmakers\u2019 federation said. Domestic demand fell 30%, while foreign orders were down 37%. In a quarterly comparison, sales in January-March were down 20% year-on-year. The Russian prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, on Friday said the coronavirus situation in Russia could yet develop into a worst-case scenario, and that the epidemic has not peaked there yet. \u201cIt is clear that the peak of infections has not yet passed, and we can\u2019t rule out the situation developing into the most difficult scenario,\u201d said Mishustin. I am covering the blog for the next hour. Please share your thoughts, news tips and any insights from where you are with me. Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Police in India barricaded parts of one of Asia\u2019s biggest slums on Friday after two coronavirus deaths. It comes as prime Minister Narendra Modi sought to dispel \u201cdarkness and uncertainty\u201d with a national light show. India so far has largely escaped the pandemic, with 2,300 infections and 56 deaths, according to official figures. However, two fatalities and a third infection in the Dharavi neighbourhood of Mumbai have set alarm bells ringing. Authorities have set up eight \u201ccontainment zones\u201d in the area, which was made famous by the 2008 film Slumdog Millionaire. \u201cWe have home-quarantined people from these buildings and cordoned off the area so people can\u2019t enter them, and enforced social distancing,\u201d said Vijay Khabale-Patil, spokesman of Mumbai\u2019s city authority. \u201cWe sprayed hydrochloric acid to disinfect these buildings and nearby areas as well \u2026 People from Dharavi are following the rules and keeping themselves and their kids inside homes.\u201d Police on Friday were not letting anyone in or out of the cordoned areas. In the UK, the deadliest peak of the coronavirus outbreak could be on Easter Sunday, according to the health secretary, Matt Hancock. When asked about reports that the death rate could peak on 12 April, Hancock told Sky: \u201cI defer to the scientists on the exact predictions, I\u2019m not going to steer you away from that. That is one perfectly possible outcome.\u201d Reuters reported on Thursday that the British government\u2019s worst case scenario envisaged the Covid-19 death toll of 50,000 if self-isolation was not fully adhered to and that the worst day for deaths was projected to be 12 April. Iran has announced 134 more deaths from the novel coronavirus, bringing the officially total to 3,294. Health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour told a news conference that 2,715 new infections had been confirmed in the past 24 hours, with cases now rising to 53,183. Iran is one of the countries worst-hit by the coronavirus pandemic and has been struggling to contain the outbreak since it reported its first deaths on 19 February. Jahanpour said 17,935 of those hospitalised with the virus had recovered, while 4,035 were in a critical condition. The government has banned all intercity travel until at least 8 April, and has repeatedly urged Iranians to stay at home. There is no official lockdown inside Iran\u2019s cities. President Hassan Rouhani warned on Thursday that there was no quick fix and that Iran might have to battle the pandemic for another year. Authorities have closed schools and universities as well as four key Shiite pilgrimage destinations, including the Fatima Masumeh shrine in Qom, the city where the first deaths were reported. They have also cancelled the main weekly Friday prayers and temporarily closed parliament. Singapore will close schools and most workplaces for a month as part of stricter measures to curb a recent jump in coronavirus infections, it said on Friday, an announcement that sent locals racing to supermarkets to stock up on staples. The city-state has won international praise for its two-month long battle against a virus that has infected over a million people globally, avoiding lockdown measures increasingly common around the world. But authorities said record jumps in new infections this week, taking its total to 1,114 cases, pointed to the need for a tougher approach. Disease experts have said breaches in Singapore\u2019s lauded virus defence have underlined the challenge of containing the pandemic around the world. Hello everyone. I am taking over the live blog while my colleague Ben Quinn gets some lunch. Please do share any thoughts or insights from where you are with me via any of the channels below. Twitter: @sloumarsh Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Hungarian journalists say a new law supposedly aimed at fighting the coronavirus will make objective reporting of the pandemic harder and leave them open to facing court cases or even jail time for their reporting. The measures, in place since Monday, have been roundly criticised for the sweeping powers they hand to the nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, to rule by decree. Another part of the bill provides penalties of up to five years in prison for those spreading misinformation during the pandemic. Journalists in the country say the new law is already being used to deny them access to information, and on occasion to threaten them. One Budapest-based journalist, who requested anonymity given the current situation in the country, said she had called a hospital over the weekend to follow up on a tip-off about a group of doctors who had reportedly contracted the coronavirus there. \u201cA few minutes later, the hospital\u2019s chief communication officer called me back and asked if I think it\u2019s a good idea to keep asking about this, a day before the government\u2019s bill will be passed,\u201d she said. The death toll in Switzerland has risen to 484 while the number of positive cases stands at 19,903, the Swiss government has said. The country has closed schools, shuttered many businesses and banned gatherings of more than five people as it fights the outbreak. The Premier League\u2019s position at the top of world football could be in danger if a solution to reducing player wages during the coronavirus crisis is not found, an analyst has warned. A week of talks between football bodies and the players\u2019 union, the PFA, has led to little movement before an extraordinary Premier League shareholders meeting on Friday. Away from negotiations, debate has centred on the tone-deafness of some clubs seeking taxpayers\u2019 money to furlough non-playing staff. According to one expert, however, it is also possible that substantial wage bills could hinder the Premier League\u2019s ability to bounce back after the crisis, leaving leading players as easy pickings for rival leagues. South Korea has denied entry to eight foreign nationals after they refused to comply with strict quarantine requirements introduced this week to help the country tackle a rise in coronavirus infections, as anger mounts over visitors who have been caught breaking self-isolation rules. The visitors, from six countries, were deported after they refused to self-isolate for two weeks, the justice ministry said. Media reports said the passengers had been informed of the rules before they boarded their flights Justin McCurry, in Tokyo, and Nemo Kim, in Seoul, report that the rule, which came into force on Wednesday, requires all overseas arrivals \u2013 including South Koreans \u2013 to quarantine at home or at government-designated facilities for 14 days. YouTube is profiting from videos promoting unproven coronavirus treatments, a report has found, as the company struggles to crack down on misinformation. The Google-owned tech company is running advertisements with videos pushing herbs, meditative music, and potentially unsafe over-the-counter supplements as cures for Covid-19, according to a report published on Friday by the Tech Transparency Project, a not-for-profit watchdog organisation. The report found at least seven videos hawking such dubious treatments with advertisements from sponsors including Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, Facebook, Liberty Mutual Insurance, the streaming startup Quibi, and Masterclass.com. In Spain, 932 people have died in the past 24 hours, a slight drop from the 950 deaths recorded one day earlier and marking the first drop in the daily death toll this week. Spain has seen 10,935 deaths from the virus, the health ministry said on Friday, accounting for about 20% of the global death toll. On Friday, authorities in Madrid said they were working to convert a second ice rink in the region into a makeshift morgue for coronavirus victims, after carrying out a similar transformation on another ice rink last month. The number of confirmed cases in the country has grown to 117,710, surpassing the number of known cases in Italy but still behind the more than 245,000 confirmed cases in the US. Amid the bleak news was a glimmer of hope: this week has seen a drop in the rate of new infections across Spain, suggesting the outbreak is slowing. The number of hospitalisations grew by around 10% this week, compared to around 30% in weeks earlier, health officials said Friday. \u201cThere\u2019s a light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d the country\u2019s health minister, Salvador Illa, told parliament on Thursday. \u201cWe are in a phase of stabilisation and, with caution and prudence, I would say that we\u2019re seeing a slow down.\u201d At one of Madrid\u2019s hardest-hit hospitals, one doctor said there were now eight empty beds in his critical care unit, one of several such units in the hospital, and that his unit had not seen any new patients in 48 hours. Spain has documented more than 30,500 recoveries from Covid-19, second only to the more than 76,000 reported recovered in China. Those who left the hospital this week included 101-year-old Encarna Buis\u00e1n, who was wheeled out of the hospital to the raucous applause of healthcare workers. \u201cI want this to give hope for everyone,\u201d said Mari Carmen, one of her daughters. \u201cMom entered when she was 100 and turned 101 in the hospital, she made it out.\u201d Some 70 tonnes of protective gear arrived in Spain this week to help the country\u2019s beleaguered healthcare workers. At least 9,400 have tested positive for Covid-19 after a shortage of supplies left them re-using masks and crafting protective gowns out of garbage bags to fight the epidemic. A video purporting to show thousands of Russian troops taking part in rehearsals for the country\u2019s Victory Day parade has raised questions about the Kremlin\u2019s efforts to fight the spread of coronavirus in the armed forces. The video, which was posted to a military affairs group in the social network Vkontakte, shows thousands of soldiers lined up apparently at the Alabino training grounds outside of Moscow. It was posted anonymously and its author has not yet been verified. In the video, an unidentified man behind the camera says: \u201cHow many people are there, 15,000? Fuck, and they\u2019ve said no more than 50 are supposed to gather in one place. Not one fucking mask.\u201d Russia has not yet cancelled its plans to hold Victory Day celebrations on 9 May, the country\u2019s most important state holiday. The Russian defence ministry said last month it planned to hold rehearsals at parade grounds outside of Moscow that copy the dimensions of Red Square. Other videos have appeared that confirm that some rehearsals are taking place for the country\u2019s Victory Day parade. The military news agency Zvezda has posted videos of T-34 tanks, the model used in the second world war, practising manoeuvres at the parade grounds in Alabino. Tens of thousands of extra police and gendarmes are being posted across France to ensure people respect the lockdown and to stop the traditional \u201cGrand Depart\u201d for the Easter holidays on Friday. Patrols will set up checkpoints on all major roads and motorways out of towns and cities with orders to turn back those attempting to break the rules. Officials in areas popular with holidaymakers and where there is a high proportion of second homes have also been ordered to carry out checks to ensure there is no sudden influx of visitors. \u201cThe virus is not on holiday,\u201d the French prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, said in a televised address on Thursday evening. Philippe was echoing the interior minister, Christophe Castaner, who only hours earlier had warned: \u201cAbsolutely do not go on holiday during the lockdown period \u2026 people must remain confined. Any abuse will be punished.\u201d Laurent Nunez, the French transport minister, echoed the stern instructions on Friday morning saying an extra 60,000 police and gendarmes will be carrying out checks in addition to the 100,000 normally on duty. \u201cYou cannot leave your home to go to a resort or a second home. There will be no leaving for holiday \u2026 there will be checks across the country,\u201d Nunez told RTL radio. Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel, has returned to her office after ending her self-quarantine today. She had been isolating after being informed that a doctor who administered a vaccine to her has tested positive. Britain\u2019s health secretary, Matt Hancock, said this morning that the prime minister, Boris Johnson, who has \u201cbeen working throughout\u201d after he tested positive for the virus, is a \u201cbit under the weather\u201d but is also \u201cup and about and on the Zoom conference calls a huge amount, and on the phone\u201d. Hungary\u2019s prime minister, who has been given new powers to effectively rule by decree, has been hitting out again at a favourite target, the philanthropist George Soros. In another big test for the European Union, Politico\u2019s Lili Bayer tweets that Viktor Orb\u00e1n has suggested that criticism of new laws have come from a \u201cnetwork\u201d led by the Hungarian-born billionaire. Soros, who has also long been a target of what some regard as blatant antisemitic vilification by Orb\u00e1n\u2019s party, has donated $1.1m to help Budapest prepare for the coronavirus pandemic. On Monday, Hungary\u2019s parliament passed a new set of coronavirus measures that includes jail terms for spreading misinformation and gives no clear time limit to a state of emergency that allows Orb\u00e1n to rule by decree. Parliament voted by 137 to 53 on Monday afternoon to pass the measures, with the two-thirds majority enjoyed by Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party enough to push them through in spite of opposition from other parties, which had demanded a time limit or sunset clause on the legislation. The bill introduces jail terms of up to five years for intentionally spreading misinformation that hinders the government response to the pandemic, leading to fears that it could be used to censor or self-censor criticism of ministers. A $100m aid plan to help Afghanistan\u2019s fight against coronavirus has been approved by the World Bank as 34 new Coronavirus cases were confirmed in the country in the last 24 hours. The figure pushes the total number of confirmed infections to 273 although testing remains low in Afghanistan and experts fear that the full extent of the spread is not known. There has also been a sixth confirmed death. Fifteen of the new infections have been recorded in the western province of Herat, raising the total number of infections in Afghanistan\u2019s worst affected area to 199. The World Bank said in a statement: \u201cTo slow and limit the spread of Covid-19 through enhanced detection, surveillance, and laboratory systems, as well as strengthen essential healthcare delivery and intensive care.\u201d The work of doctors, nurses and other staff treating patients with Covid-19 in Barcelona has been documented by a team of journalists from the Associated Press, who accessed a makeshift Intensive Care Unit there. In an extraordinary dispatch, they report: The tension is palpable. There is no non-essential talking. An orchestra of medical monitors marks the tempo with an endless series of soft, distinct beeps. Never have so many people been inside the library of the Germans Trias i Pujol hospital in north-eastern Spain. But the healthcare workers in improvised protective gear aren\u2019t consulting medical books. Instead, they\u2019re treating patients in critical condition suffering from pneumonia caused by the coronavirus. From the outside, this makeshift intensive-care unit in Badalona, near Barcelona, looks nothing like a library. The bookshelves have been removed to make room for up to 20 hospital beds, breathing machines and an array of medical equipment after the longstanding ICU and other areas of the hospital flooded with Covid-19 patients. With the scarcity of full-body protective suits across Spain, doctors and nurses are employing what they can find, reusing masks, layering oversized surgical gowns with plastic aprons and running through an infinite number of latex gloves. Like scuba divers, they apply a small dose of detergent to their goggles just before stepping into the sweltering, virus-laden room in the hopes of mitigating the inevitable fogging of their eye protection caused by their own breathing. Challenges in keeping people apart have been underscored by data released by Google for 131 countries showing whether the number of visits to shops, parks and workplaces dropped in March, when many states issued stay-at-home orders to rein in the spread of coronavirus. While visits to supermarkets and grocery stores surged in Singapore, the UK and elsewhere before travel restrictions were imposed, visits to retail and recreational places fell 26% in Japan, where authorities have been relatively relaxed in urging social distancing measures but where calls have been growing daily for a state of emergency. Visits to workplace dropped just 9%. Google\u2019s analysis of location data from billions of users\u2019 phones is the largest public dataset available to help health authorities assess if people are abiding with shelter-in-place and similar orders issued across the world. Its reports show charts that compare traffic from 16 February to 29 March at underground, train and bus stations, grocery stores and other broad categories of places with a five-week period earlier this year. In Italy, one of the countries hardest hit by the virus, visits to retail and recreation locations, including restaurants and movie theaters, plunged 94% while visits to workplaces slid 63%. Reflecting the severity of the crisis there, grocery and pharmacy visits in Italy dropped 85% and park visits were down by 90%. In the US, California, which was the first in the with a statewide lockdown, cut visits to retail and recreation locations by half. By contrast, Arkansas, one of the few states without a sweeping lockdown, has seen such visits fall 29%, the lowest for a US state. Interactive maps charting the spread of the virus, and where it has been most deadly, have been launched by the Guardian. While the disease is hitting Italy and Spain with particular cruelty, the trajectory in many countries is the same; the UK and US are a couple of weeks behind Italy in the progress of the pandemic. Unable to access state benefits, food and even running water as Zimbabwe shuts up shop, people in the capital, Harare ,and elsewhere fear the worst. While affluent Zimbabweans stocked their pantries with food last weekend in preparation for the lockdown, which began on Monday, poor people were unable to do so, Nyasha Chingono reports in this piece for Guardian development. She spoke to Nelson Mahunde, a 70-year old who had no idea Zimbabwe has been plunged into a 21-day national lockdown to curb the spread of Covid 19. \u201cNo one in my village told me that the banks would be closed today. I don\u2019t even know what to do. My family depends on that money for survival. If it is true that no one will be moving for 21 days, then my family will starve,\u201d he said. Norway\u2019s rate of unemployment rose sixfold in March to 14.7%, the Labour and Welfare Agency (NAV) has said, the highest level on record as the economy ground to a halt amid efforts to curb the coronavirus pandemic. As many as 10.7% were fully unemployed, while the remaining 3% were registered as partially unemployed, Reuters reported. The Norwegian government three weeks ago announced emergency shutdowns of many public and private institutions, including schools and kindergartens, sending the economy into a tailspin and triggering hundreds of thousands of layoffs. Singapore\u2019s prime minster is doing a live briefing (watch here) on Facebook about new measures, which will involve the closure of most of the state\u2019s workplaces, except for essential services and key economic sectors. Lee Hsien Loong has said, as part of tighter measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus , that people should avoid socialising with others beyond their own households and go out only to do essential things, such as buy food at markets. The government will be distributing face masks to households in the coming weeks, he added. Two months ago Ireland\u2019s economy was humming: stellar growth, fiscal surplus, near full employment. What a difference a pandemic makes. The central bank on Friday warned that this year the economy will shrink by 8%, perhaps 15%, if lockdown continues beyond June. Instead of a \u20ac2.2bn surplus the government faces a \u20ac19.6bn deficit. And unemployment has just exploded to an all-time high of 513,350, more than a fifth of the labour force, with worse to come. \u201cThe starting point for the recovery will depend on the depth and duration of the downturn, which is, as yet, unknown,\u201d said Mark Cassidy, the bank\u2019s director of economics and statistics. Leo Varadkar, the taoiseach, said Irish people had suffered enough after the 2008 crash and that the government would strive to cushion the aftershocks. \u201cThe objective, if I have anything to do with it, will be to avoid another era of austerity,\u201d he said. Talks were under way among European Union member states over whether or not to extend border closures beyond Easter in order to tackle the coronavirus crisis, according to the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. \u201cWe are in consultation with member states on how to proceed beyond Easter,\u201d she told Europe 1 radio. Von Der Leyen also reiterated that the next EU budget should take the form of a new \u201cMarshall Plan\u201d to drive Europe\u2019s recovery from the coronavirus outbreak, and that she felt Europe would emerge from the coronavirus crisis in a stronger state. Eurozone states that need aid from the bloc\u2019s bailout fund to tackle the coronavirus should get it quickly and not be first subjected to visits from officials proposing policies like during the euro zone crisis, Germany\u2019s finance minister said last night. Olaf Scholz told the broadcaster ARD that he was convinced the European Stability Mechanism - a bailout fund with \u20ac400bn ($433.88bn) in firepower - had instruments suitable for use during the coronavirus outbreak, which has hit eurozone countries like Italy and Spain hard. The comments by Von der Leyen and Scholz come amid rising tensions - EU flags have been burned in Italy where polls show an uptick in unhappiness with the union - and proposals by France for a coronavirus \u2018rescue fund\u2019 for states. Iraq has banned the Reuters news agency from operating in Iraq for three months for reporting that the number of coronavirus cases in the country is much higher than acknowledged by officials. The agency reported that the actual number of those suffering from the virus could be thousands higher than the official tally of 772 and that the scale of the outbreak has been downplayed to avoid public panic. The report adds impetus to concerns reported in the Guardian this week that state figures of suspected Covid 19 patients in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon may be substantially lower than real numbers. Hezbollah has said it is opening treatment centres in southern Lebanon that supplement the state\u2019s health system. However, there are fears that a parallel state structure could obscure real numbers of those infected with the virus. All three countries have links to Iran, the centre of a pandemic in the region that has taken root among religious pilgrims and merchants who had travelled back to Baghdad, Beirut and Damascus, many since returning to communities outside the capitals. This piece of Chinese technology - tweeted here by China social trend watcher Manya Koetse - looks interesting. Police in Israel have surrounded the city of Bnei Brak with barricades and begun evacuating around 4,500 elderly people after the densely-populated area saw an explosion of Covid-19 cases. Predominately populated with ultra-Orthodox Jewish people, Bnei Brak is near the commercial capital of Tel Aviv but is poor and congested. Some ultra-orthodox rabbis \u2013 long distrustful of the Israeli state\u2019s authority over their way of life \u2013 had also initially rejected stringent coronavirus measures, playing down the risk and refusing to close synagogues and packed religious seminaries. Medical experts estimate up to 38% of Bnei Brak\u2019s roughly 200,000 inhabitants could be infected, significantly higher the national average. Israel\u2019s cabinet declared the city a \u201crestricted zone\u201d on Thursday night, with measures imposed early on Friday. Around 1,000 police officers had been dispatched. Residents will not be allowed to leave the city except under special circumstances. Police in Pakistan will today enforce a strict lockdown to prevent people from going to mosques to offer Friday prayers and fuel a rise in coronavirus infection, officials have said, after failing to prevent large congregations last week. Health experts have warned of an epidemic in South Asia, home to a fifth of the world\u2019s population, that could easily overwhelm its weak public health systems. But authorities in Pakistan and Bangladesh, another Muslim majority nation, and even India have struggled to persuade conservative religious groups to maintain social distancing in order to curb the spread of the virus. The government in Pakistan\u2019s southern province of Sindh, home to the country\u2019s largest city, Karachi, will enforce a \u201ccurfew-like\u201d lockdown for three hours beginning 12 noon Friday to deter people from coming out of their homes for prayers, Reuters reported. Concern is growing that a woefully inadequate health system will leave Malawi unable to cope when Covid-19 arrives. In Malawi only 20 people a day can be tested for the virus, and there are just 25 intensive care unit beds and seven ventilators in the country of more than 18 million people, John Vidal reports in this piece for the Guardian. Since February, however, the government has been racing to curb Covid\u2019s arrival. It has wheeled out a \u00a324m preparedness plan, suspended international flights, banned weddings and gatherings of more than 100 people, closed schools and universities, and is making anyone arriving from Europe, China, or the US self-isolate. According to the ministry of health, 4,603 people who have entered the country in the past few weeks are \u201cunder surveillance\u201d. Britain\u2019s \u2018peak\u2019 for coronavirus infections will be slightly sooner than previously thought and will be in the next few weeks, the UK\u2019s health minster has said, but it is very very sensitive to how many people continue to follow the social distancing guidelines. Hancock went on to say he was open to people and companies contacting him with ideas for how to resolve the problems and questions which his department was attempting to solve. \u201cI saw what happened with the ventilators when we got non ventilator companies in to build companies side by side with the smaller but expert ventilation companies,\u201d he added. The UK still does not currently have a reliable home test at the moment to carry out home blood tests that would enable people to know if they have had coronavirus, Britain\u2019s health secretary has said. Matt Hancock has been pressed in morning interviews on how many of the new UK target of 100,000 tests a day \u2013 up from much lower figures \u2013 would be composed of the blood, or antibody test. Hundreds of formulas and details for proposed ways of doing the antibody tests had been sent in to the government by experts but a good enough one has not been found. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme: \u201cWe haven\u2019t yet found one that works to be good enough to use. I get pressure on this. I get people saying \u2018oh come on it may not be perfectly accurate but can\u2019t we just use it.\u2019 The test problems is that with a test that is not of high quality you end up giving false assurance.\u201d People could go into harm\u2019s way when they may have immunity to the virus in those circumstances, he added. In another interview, Hancock described having coronavirus as a \u201cpretty unpleasant experience\u201d and said he had lost half a stone during the illness and said it was \u201clike having glass in my throat\u201d. He said: \u201cFor me it was short-lived and I was able to come back to work yesterday and I\u2019m in full health. But it is worrying. I\u2019ve lost half a stone, it\u2019s quite a serious impact directly. But thankfully for me I could get through it.\u201d China\u2019s foreign ministry is advising foreign diplomats to stop coming to Beijing, after the country temporarily banned most foreigners from entering to prevent a resurgence of a coronavirus epidemic, a spokeswoman said on Friday. Foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters during a daily briefing that the ministry was aware of confirmed coronavirus cases among foreign diplomats in China. The Hong Kong government has accused a media organisation of \u201cbreaching the One-China principle\u201d after a reporter asked a senior World Health Organization (WHO) adviser a question about Taiwan during an interview. RTHK\u2019s Yvonne Tong asked WHO adviser Bruce Aylward whether the organisation would reconsider Taiwan\u2019s membership, long objected to by Beijing. Aylward appeared not to hear Tong, and then either hung up on her or was disconnected. On Thursday, Hong Kong\u2019s secretary for commerce and economic development, Edward Yau, accused RTHK of breaching its charter obligations, which include \u201cpromoting understanding of the concept of \u2018one country, two systems\u2019.\u201d The British supermarket group Sainsbury\u2019s has said it would start to remove the customer purchasing limits it imposed as a response to increased demand during the coronavirus emergency. \u201cAs stock continues to build, we have been reviewing whether we still need to limit the number of items people buy. I am pleased to tell you that we will start to remove limits from Sunday,\u201d Chief Executive Mike Coupe said in a letter to customers. Limits will remain in place on the most popular items which include UHT milk, pasta and tinned tomatoes, he said. Here\u2019s a link on the company\u2019s website. British parliamentarians have called for strict curbs on gambling during the Covid-19 lockdown, including a moratorium on advertising, calling the betting industry\u2019s own proposals \u201cvery weak\u201d. An industry body, the Betting &amp; Gaming Council (BGC) issued a 10-point pledge last week, promising extra steps to ensure firms do not exploit vulnerable people and addicts who may be at increased risk due to the inertia inherent in staying at home for long periods. But in a letter to the government \u2013 and the BGC \u2013 22 MPs, two lords and one of the UK\u2019s foremost gambling addiction experts said the measures put forward by the trade body were either weak, vague or already formed part of requirements of their licence to operate. In the UK, the government is to follow through today on its attempt to regain the initiative around plans for mass testing after announcing last night it is to move from 10,000 tests a day to a new target of 100,000 a day by the end of the month. It comes as the new Nightingale hospital opens in London at the ExCeL conference centre. Other field hospitals in England have been announced in Bristol and Harrogate while there are temporary hospitals for Birmingham and Manchester. Similar initiatives are being rolled out in Glasgow and Cardiff. Heathrow airport has also announced it is to operate with just one runway from next Monday. While there are significantly fewer flights, it said it needed to remain open for vital foot and medical supplies. The airport has two runways and will alternate which one they keep open on a weekly basis, a spokesman said. In 2018, Heathrow served 80.1 million passengers, This is Ben Quinn in London picking up the blog now. Here\u2019s a summary of the main events so far today. There are more than 1,002,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus worldwide and more than 51,400 deaths. In the UK, there are more than 34,000 cases after a sharp rise in the number of confirmed cases on Thursday, and more than 2,900 deaths. A temporary hospital, built in nine days, will open in London on Friday. The US, which has the largest number of cases of any country, has more than 236,000 confirmed cases and more than 5,600 deaths. President Trump tested negative to the virus on Thursday, and 6.7 million Americans joined unemployment queues over the past week. In the US, the Zaandam cruise liner, on which four people have died, has docked in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, after previously being denied entry. Dozens of other passengers are sick with flu-like symptoms on the vessel. It\u2019s sister ship, the Rotterdam, also docked in Florida. Residents of Wuhan were warned to stay indoors and strengthen protection measures, a few days before travel restrictions on the city at the centre of the pandemic are scheduled to be lifted. China will hold a national day of mourning on Saturday for \u201cmartyrs\u201d who died in the fight against the epidemic, the official Xinhua news agency says. China recorded 31 new cases on Friday, 29 of which were imported. New Zealand\u2019s health minister has apologised to the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, after he was photographed mountain-biking, apparently flouting the government\u2019s own advice to exercise safely and locally during a countrywide lockdown. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Dr Brendan Murphy, has said worldwide cases of Covid-19 could be \u201cfive to 10 times\u201d higher than the one million known currently. Murphy says the only numbers he has total faith in are the Australian numbers, because \u201cwe have the highest testing rate in the world\u201d (Trump has also claimed this mantle). A row has erupted in the US over the sacking of the commander of the US Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier, which is docked in Guam. Capt Brett Crozier had written a scathing letter asking for stronger measures to control a coronavirus outbreak onboard his warship, which was subsequently leaked to the media. Hong Kong\u2019s airline, Cathay Pacific, carried just 582 passengers one day this week, with a load factor of 18.3%, Reuters reports, quoting an internal memo. Its CEO and chairman have agreed to take a 30% base salary cut until December. Also in Hong Kong, pubs and bars were ordered to close for two weeks from 6pm on Friday as the financial hub steps up social distancing restrictions and joins cities around the world in the battle to halt the spread of coronavirus. Governments in the Middle East need to act fast to limit the spread of the coronavirus after the number of cases rose to nearly 60,000, almost double their level a week earlier, the World Health Organization said on Thursday. Here\u2019s a look at some of today\u2019s front pages in the UK. Prince Charles will open the new NHS Nightingale hospital at the ExCeL conference centre in London Docklands on Friday, which will eventually be capable of providing support for up to 4,000 coronavirus patients if required. Charles, recently recovered from a mild case of Covid-19, will conduct the ceremony via videolink from his Scottish residence at Birkhall, where he self-isolated for seven days last week. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, also recently out of self-isolation following a positive test for coronavirus, and Prof Charles Knight, chief executive of NHS Nightingale, will join a small group representing medical staff, the Ministry of Defence, contractors and volunteers at the new hospital. It comes as the NHS announced two further NHS Nightingale hospitals will be built in Bristol and Harrogate to provide hundreds of extra beds if local services need them during the peak of coronavirus, in addition to the one at the ExCeL. The NHS England chief executive, Sir Simon Stevens, will confirm on Friday that the extra sites in south-west England and Yorkshire \u2013 which will have up to 1,500 beds if needed \u2013 have joined Manchester and Birmingham as the latest locations for major new facilities outside of London. Each of the five Nightingale hospitals will serve the wider regions in which they are located. The new hospital in east London is the first to open and will initially provide up to 500 beds equipped with ventilators and oxygen. The capacity will then increase, potentially up to several thousands beds should it be required. Constructed within nine days, the conversion of the ExCeL conference centre into a field hospital has been cited as perhaps the most ambitious medical project Britain has seen since the end of the second world war, and will dwarf all other hospitals in the UK. Planning has involved soldiers with experience from Afghanistan and the west African Ebola crisis working in support of health service staff. Up to 200 soldiers a day have been working alongside NHS staff and civilian contractors. Charles is expected to pay tribute to those who have worked tirelessly to create the new medical facility, and to the people across the UK who are delivering frontline care to those affected by the coronavirus crisis. Natalie Grey, head of nursing at NHS Nightingale, will unveil a plaque on behalf of Charles marking the occasion. Stevens said: \u201cIt\u2019s nothing short of extraordinary that this new hospital in London has been established from scratch in less than a fortnight \u2026 Now we are gearing up to repeat that feat at another four sites across the country to add to the surge capacity in current NHS hospitals. \u201cWe\u2019re giving the go ahead to these additional sites, hoping they may not be needed but preparing in case they are. But that will partly depend on continuing public support for measures to reduce growth in the infection rate by staying at home to save lives.\u201d The new hospital in Manchester will be built at the city\u2019s Manchester Central complex while the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham will take care of patients as needed in the West Midlands, the region second hardest hit by the virus. Each of these new services will initially have up to 500 beds, potentially offering as many as 3,000 more between them if cases escalate. Sir Elton John, Sir Paul McCartney and David Beckham were among the stars paying tribute to NHS staff risking their lives fighting the coronavirus pandemic, PA reports. In a video shared online by NHS England, stars from film, TV, music and sport held up a placard bearing the slogans OurNHSPeople and ThankYouNHS. Sir Elton, Sir Paul and Beckham were joined by A-listers including Sir Mick Jagger, Kate Winslet, Daniel Craig, Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Dame Kristin Scott Thomas. Kylie Minogue, Naomi Harris, Eddie Redmayne Dame Jessica Ennis-Hill and Sir Mo Farah also featured. The video was shared hours before the nation saluted key workers for a second successive Thursday. Up and down the country grateful Britons stood on their doorsteps and hung out of windows to clap, cheer and bang pots and pans to show their appreciation for key workers. I mentioned earlier that the Asian Development Bank had said Vietnam\u2019s GDP growth will slow to 4.98% this year, versus 7.02% last year. I now have a fuller copy of the report, which says regional economic growth in developing Asia will decline sharply in 2020. It forecasts regional growth of 2.2% in 2020, down from the 5.5% the ADB had forecast in September. But the ADB says growth is expected to rebound to 6.2% in 2021, assuming that the outbreak ends and activity normalises. \u201cThe evolution of the global pandemic\u2014and thus the outlook for the global and regional economy\u2014is highly uncertain. Growth could turn out lower, and the recovery slower, than we are currently forecasting. For this reason, strong and coordinated efforts are needed to contain the COVID-19 pandemic and minimise its economic impact, especially on the most vulnerable,\u201d said ADB Chief Economist Yasuyuki Sawada. The ADB estimates the pandemic will: reduce China\u2019s growth to 2.3% this year, before rebounding to 7.3% in 2021. It estimates growth in India will slow to 4.0% in fiscal year 2020 before strengthening to 6.2% in 2021. Economic activity in the Pacific subregion is expected to contract by 0.3% in 2020 before recovering to 2.7% in 2021. New Zealand\u2019s health minister has apologised to Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern after he was photographed mountain biking, apparently flouting the government\u2019s own advice to exercise safely and locally during a country-wide lockdown. David Clark told Ardern on Thursday night that he had driven to a park 2km from his Dunedin home. You can read our full story below. Here\u2019s our latest global wrap on the coronavirus pandemic, toplining with the citizens of Wuhan being told to stay inside and be vigilant as the date for their travel restrictions being lifted approaches (8 April). As I mentioned earlier, tomorrow will be a national day of mourning in China. Get the full story below: In Hungary journalists say a new law supposedly aimed at fighting the coronavirus will make objective reporting of the pandemic harder and leave them open to facing court cases or even jail time for their reporting. The measures, in place since Monday, have been roundly criticised for the sweeping powers they hand to the nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, to rule by decree. Another part of the bill provides penalties of up to five years in prison for those spreading misinformation during the pandemic. Journalists in the country say the new law is already being used to deny them access to information, and on occasion to threaten them. You can read the Guardian\u2019s full story below: Farmers across Europe bank on improvised armies of pickers to save harvest, as coronavirus lockdowns have stopped migrant workers from arriving to carry out the work. Fruit and vegetable crops in Spain, Italy, France, Germany, the UK and other countries risk rotting in the fields \u2013 putrefying testaments to the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cIt won\u2019t be pretty,\u201d said Eamonn Kehoe, a soft fruit specialist with Ireland\u2019s agri-food agency, Teagasc. \u201cIf they don\u2019t have the staff it won\u2019t be picked. It\u2019s a nightmare, a perfect storm.\u201d He was referring to Ireland\u2019s growers, but farmers and agriculture officials across Europe have equally grim warnings about abandoned fields and lost crops unless they can conjure improvised armies of pickers. Spain, which is the EU\u2019s biggest exporter of fruit and vegetables, is already feeling the impact. \u201cWe\u2019re very limited at the moment when it comes to having enough hands to pick and harvest,\u201d said Pedro Barato, the president of Spain\u2019s largest farming association, Asaja. You can read the full story below: Australia\u2019s Chief Medical Officer Dr Brendan Murphy has said worldwide cases of Covid-19 could be \u201cfive to 10 times\u201d higher than the one million known currently. Murphy says the only numbers he has total faith in are the Australian numbers, because \u201cwe have the highest testing rate in the world\u201d (Trump has also claimed this mantle). I think China is in a really difficult position. They did clamp down incredibly hard and they stopped transmission. But their population is not immune. They still have a lot of people in their population and they are, obviously, trying very hard to prevent second waves. I think they have been pretty transparent but as I said, I\u2019m only confident about our numbers. I\u2019m certainly not confident even the numbers out of the US are much higher than being reported because nobody else in the world has been doing testing like we have. Nobody else in the world got on to all those original cases out of Wuhan in January and contained them. That\u2019s why we are now dealing with what we know rather than a huge community transmission that happened all through February in countries like Italy and the US. We\u2019re on top of our cases. But we still have a long way to go. At the same press conference, Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, said modelling done for the government shows that \u201cat the current rate\u201d Australia is \u201ctracking well\u201d. At the current rate if we keep doing what we\u2019re doing and keep doing the work to upgrade ICU capacity and secure the extra ventilators then right now that trajectory is promising, it\u2019s encouraging, but there are no guarantees. This virus writes its own rules. You can follow all of the developments in Australia\u2019 on Guardian Australia\u2019s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. The Asian Development Bank says that Vietnam\u2019s GDP growth will slow to 4.98% this year, versus 7.02% last year. Still with business and share markets have had a sticky day after hopes of a Saudi-Russia deal on oil production faded. Donald Trump talked up the hope of a deal that would reverse a decision last month by the two countries to boost production, which shocked investors and saw prices plunge to $20 a barrel. But that looks less certain now and the price of Brent crude slipped more than 1% in the Asia trading session. Shares also struggled and Wall Street was set to open down on Friday. All the main indices in Asia Pacific, from Sydney to Seoul, are in the red. Some more details from my colleague Helen Davidson about the capacity cuts at Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong-based airline that has been devastated by the city protests and now the virus. Augustus Tang, the chief executive, says the airline\u2019s passenger fleet \u201chas been virtually grounded as the remaining demand has disappeared\u201d, according to a memo seen by Reuters. \u201cWe carried 582 customers on one day this week, with a load factor of just 18.3%,\u201d he said, adding that a usual day would see 100,000 passengers. Cathay\u2019s passenger capacity will now be further reduced from the previously announced \u201cskeleton schedule\u201d to two weekly flights to four long-haul destinations- London Heathrow, Los Angeles, Vancouver, and Sydney. Tang said they hoped to maintain three weekly flights on regional services to Tokyo, Taipei, New Delhi, Bangkok, Jakarta, Manila, Ho Chi Minh City and Singapore, as well as three weekly flights to Beijing, Shanghai and Kuala Lumpur. He will take a 30% cut to his base salary from April to December, as will Chairman Patrick Healy, with executive directors taking a 25% cut, the memo said. This week the Australian Broadcasting Corporation\u2019s 7.30 Report TV programme asked viewers if any of their children had messages to send to their grandparents, who they couldn\u2019t see at the moment because of the home isolation requirements. The result was terrific. China has released its latest daily figures. They include 31 new cases, 29 of which were imported. A row has erupted in the US over the sacking of the commander of the US Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier, which is docked in Guam. Captain Brett Crozier had written a scathing letter asking for stronger measures to control a coronavirus outbreak onboard his warship, which was subsequently leaked to the media. Acting US Navy Secretary Thomas Modly said the commander exercised poor judgment. Modly said the letter was sent through the chain of command but Crozier did not safeguard it from being released outside the chain. \u201cHe sent it out pretty broadly and in sending it out pretty broadly, he did not take care to ensure that it couldn\u2019t be leaked and that\u2019s part of his responsibility,\u201d Modly said. \u201cIt raised alarm bells unnecessarily,\u201d he added. Over 100 personnel on the Theodore Roosevelt have tested positive for the coronavirus so far. In the four-page letter, Crozier, who took command in November, described a bleak situation aboard the nuclear-powered carrier as more sailors tested positive for the highly contagious respiratory virus. He called for \u201cdecisive action\u201d: removing over 4,000 sailors from the ship and isolating them. He said that unless the Navy acted immediately, it would be failing to properly safeguard \u201cour most trusted asset - our sailors.\u201d The ship has since docked at US naval base in Guam. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said the Trump administration\u2019s decision to remove the commander showed \u201cpoor judgement\u201d. Fujifilm Holdings Corp says it has developed a new test for the coronavirus that reduces the results time to about two hours. The test was developed by subsidiary Fujifilm Wako Pure Chemical Corp and will be released on 15 April, Reuters reports. The SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR Detection kit will be able to deliver results for the virus that causes Covid-19 faster than existing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, which presently take four to six hours, the company said. Jazz guitarist John Bucky Pizzarelli who was inducted to the New Jersey Hall of Fame, has died at the age of 94. The virtuoso who had played for presidents at the White House during his long and esteemed career died on Wednesday at his home in New Jersey. His family told the New York Times they believe the cause of death was the coronavirus. And the Bergen Record reports that Pizzarelli tested positive for the virus on Sunday. Associated Press says: Pizzarelli was born in Paterson, New Jersey, and had a career that spanned eight decades. He showed off his musical chops for former presidents like Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton and played alongside musical icons like Frank Sinatra. Jazz guitar wouldn\u2019t be what it is today without Bucky Pizzarelli, said jazz guitarist Frank Vignola. He and Freddie Green were responsible for a style of rhythm guitar playing that has lasted until 2020. Pizzarelli died with his wife, Ruth, his son Martin, and his caregiver at his side. China will hold a national mourning on Saturday for \u201cmartyrs\u201d who died in the fight against the epidemic, the official Xinhua news agency says. Three minutes of silence will be observed at 10am on 4 April across the country \u201cwhile air raid sirens and horns of automobiles, trains and ships will wail in grief,\u201d Xinhua said. China has reported a total of 81,589 confirmed cases, which exclude asymptomatic patients, and 3,318 deaths from the outbreak. Just while I\u2019m on the airline industry, Hong Kong\u2019s carrier Cathay Pacific carried just 582 passengers one day this week, with a load factor of 18.3%, Reuters reports, quoting an internal memo. It\u2019s CEO and chairman have agreed to take a 30% base salary cut until December. We have written quite a lot about the dire state of the airline industry, but here\u2019s a little more woe to add to it ... International seat capacity has dropped by almost 80% from a year ago and half the world\u2019s airplanes are in storage, new data shows, suggesting the aviation industry may take years to recover from the coronavirus pandemic. Carriers including United Airlines Holdings Inc and Air New Zealand have warned they are likely to emerge from the crisis smaller, and there are fears others may not survive. \u201cIt is likely that when we get across to the other side of the pandemic, things won\u2019t return to the vibrant market conditions we had at the start of the year,\u201d said Olivier Ponti, vice president at data firm ForwardKeys. \u201cIt\u2019s also possible that a number of airlines will have gone bust and uneconomic discounts will be necessary to attract demand back,\u201d he said in a statement. There seems to be some movement on whether or not Americans should wear face masks routinely, outside of the house. Speaking at a White House briefing, Dr Deborah Birx, a member of President Trump\u2019s coronavirus task force, said the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would issue guidelines in the coming days on the use of face coverings. Birx however cautioned that Americans, who have been admonished to stay at home except for essential outings, should not develop a \u201cfalse sense of security\u201d that they are fully protected from the respiratory illness by wearing a mask. New York City\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio, urged residents to wear face coverings, citing studies showing that the virus can be transmitted by infected people who are showing no symptoms. \u201cWhat that means is when you put on that face covering you\u2019re protecting everyone else,\u201d de Blasio said. The Democratic mayor suggested New Yorkers use scarves or other home-made masks because medical-grade protective gear was in short supply. The WHO has said only people who are sick or treating or assisting people who are sick should wear masks. The Guardian asked four experts for their advice on face masks. In case you missed this, the Guardian\u2019s Yang Tian has written about her anticipation of receiving a care package from her father in Beijing: \u201cDad has always sent care packages from China. Now it\u2019s face masks instead of snacks.\u201d Hong Kong has ordered pubs and bars to close for two weeks from 6 pm on Friday as the financial hub steps up social distancing restrictions and joins cities around the world in the battle to halt the spread of coronavirus. Reuters reports that anyone who violates the new law faces six months in jail and a fine of HK$50,000 ($6,450). The extraordinary move comes a week after the government stopped all tourist arrivals and transit passengers at its airport and said it was considering suspending the sale of alcohol in some venues. \u201cAny premises (commonly known as bar or pub) that is exclusively or mainly used for the sale or supply of intoxicating liquors ... must be closed,\u201d the government said in a statement late on Thursday. It added that 62 confirmed coronavirus cases in the city had been linked to bars, leading to 14 further infections, including a 40-day-old baby. Hong Kong has 802 cases of coronavirus and four deaths from the disease. Alcohol will still be available in supermarkets and convenience stores. Here are some of the images from Fort Lauderdale, where the Zaandam cruise liner has finally docked. It\u2019s a salient reminder of the human cost of this tragedy. The Zaandam cruise line, on which four people have died, has docked in Fort Lauderdale, after previously being denied entry. Dozens of other passengers are sick with flu-like symptoms on the vessels. Earlier this week the ship offloaded its healthy passengers onto its sister-ship, the Rotterdam, which has now also been given permission to dock in Florida\u2019s Port Everglades. The Zaandam cruise liner last entered port in Valpara\u00edso, Chile, more than two weeks ago and has been stranded at sea with a Covid-19 outbreak onboard worsening after several Latin American countries refused to let it dock. The agreement to let both ships dock in Florida comes after opposition from the state governor Ron DeSantis and several Broward county commissioners who feared that they could not cope with an influx of sick passengers. You can read our full story here Residents of the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the virus began, have been told to strengthen self-protection measures and avoid going out unless it is necessary. The City\u2019s Communist party chief, Wang Zhonglin, was quoted as saying in a statement published by the Wuhan city government that the risk of a rebound in the city\u2019s coronavirus epidemic remained high due to both internal and external risks and that it must continue to maintain prevention and control measures. Britain will build a further two temporary hospitals to treat coronavirus patients, the National Health Service said as its first field hospital prepares to open in London on Friday. The NHS said it would build a 1,000-patient facility at a university in Bristol, south-west England, and a 500-bed facility at a conference centre in Harrogate in the north of the country. That means it is now planning to open five field hospitals in the coming weeks. The first, the NHS Nightingale in east London will receive its first patients next week. It will be located in Docklands and will eventually be capable of providing support for up to 4,000 coronavirus patients if required. It will initially provide up to 500 beds Prince Charles will open the hospital via video link from his Scottish residence, where he is recovering from Covid-19. In case you missed it, the speaker of Iran\u2019s parliament, Ali Larijani, has contracted the coronavirus, the highest-ranking official among several senior government figures to catch the disease, the Associated Press reports. The parliament in Iran announced Larijani\u2019s illness on its website, saying he was receiving treatment in quarantine. Iran\u2019s health ministry said Thursday the coronavirus had killed another 124 people, pushing the country\u2019s death toll to 3,160. Governments in the Middle East need to act fast to limit the spread of the coronavirus after cases rose to nearly 60,000, almost double their level a week earlier, the World Health Organization said on Thursday. \u201cNew cases have been reported in some of the most vulnerable countries with fragile health systems,\u201d said Ahmed Al-Mandhari, the WHO\u2019s director for the Eastern Mediterranean region, which includes Pakistan, Afghanistan, Somalia and Djibouti, as well as Middle Eastern states. \u201cEven in countries with stronger heath systems, we have seen a worrying spike in the numbers of cases and deaths reported,\u201d he said in a statement. Outside of Iran, which has reported just over 50,000 cases, confirmed coronavirus numbers have been relatively low in the Middle East compared to Europe, the United States and Asia. But health officials fear that cases of the highly contagious respiratory illness caused by the virus are under-reported and that many countries with weak governments and health systems eroded by conflict will struggle to cope. \u201cI cannot stress enough the urgency of the situation,\u201d said Mandhari. \u201cThe increasing numbers of cases show that transmission is rapidly occurring at local and community levels.\u201d \u201cWe still have a window of opportunity, but this window is slowly closing day by day,\u201d he added. In a sign of the sizeable impact that this pandemic is having on travel, London\u2019s Heathrow airport has said it will close one of its runways from Monday because of a fall in traffic. The airport has two runways and will alternate which one they keep open on a weekly basis, a spokesman said. They added: \u201cAlthough we are seeing significantly fewer flights at the moment, Heathrow will remain open so that we can continue to play a crucial role in helping to secure vital medical goods and food for the nation during this unprecedented epidemic.\u201d On Thursday BA suspended 30,o00 staff from cabin crew to ground staff, engineers and head office employees, until the end of May under the government furlough scheme for companies hit by the coronavirus pandemic. In 2018, Heathrow served 80.1 million passengers, according to their website. A total of 475,624 flights took off from the west London site in the same year. Gatwick Airport has also significantly scaled back its operations, closing one of its two terminals on Wednesday and its runway will only be open for scheduled flights between 2pm and 10pm. The measures will be in place for a minimum of one month. Gatwick recorded 47 million passengers last year. For those of you who may not have seen some of our coverage of President Trump\u2019s recent press conference, there were a few key lines: The president blamed the states for lack of supplies in fighting the virus. One of the key medical faces of the virus fight, Dr Deborah Birx, said not everyone was adhering to social distancing rules: \u201cI can tell by the curve as it is today that not everyone is following the social distancing guidance,\u201d Birx said. \u201cWe can bend our curve, but everyone has to take responsibility as Americans.\u201d Newly approved testing kits will be able to give results in 15 minutes, Birx said. Trade and economic adviser, and Defence Production Act policy coordinator, Peter Navarro, said that the bidding on supplies inside the US is due to a \u201cblack market\u201d of bidders driving up prices. He said domestic supplies are being bought up and sent abroad. Vice president Mike Pence said the US had the \u201cgreatest healthcare system in the world\u201d. Jared Kushner addressed the briefing but said very little, other than people were working hard and doing a good job. You can stay up to date on all of our live coverage from the US on our US blog: Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic. I\u2019m Alison Rourke and will be steering our coverage for the next few hours. As the number of infections rose past one million, and deaths passed 50,000, countries, including the United Sates, are taking increasing measures to combat the virus. New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, has warned his state will run out of ventilators in six days. Donald Trump has issued orders to use the defence production act to make ventilators. The president has also confirmed in his daily press briefing that he has tested negative for Covid-19. The US now has just under 240,000 infections and 5, 798 deaths according to the Johns Hopkins university tracker. Here\u2019s a summary of the other top points: Global cases of the virus have passed one million, according to figures collected by researchers from Johns Hopkins University. Deaths worldwide have passed 50,000. In terms of deaths, Italy remains the country worst affected by the outbreak, with 13,915 fatalities, followed by Spain, with 10,003 deaths. The US is now the third worst affected country, with 5,316 total deaths. Governments in the Middle East need to act fast to limit the spread of the coronavirus after cases rose to nearly 60,000, almost double their level a week earlier, the World Health Organization said on Thursday. The UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the government was hoping to build an \u201cat-scale\u201d diagnostics industry to reach 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month, as he unveiled his five-pillar strategy. Just 5,000 NHS staff have been tested so far. More than 6.65 million people have filed for unemployment benefits in the US last week, according to the latest official figures, highlighting the devastating economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the American economy. The pro-independence leader of Catalonia, the region of Spain hardest hit by the coronavirus after Madrid, has abandoned his government\u2019s initial reluctance to seek help from the Spanish army, saying any assistance would be gratefully received.
