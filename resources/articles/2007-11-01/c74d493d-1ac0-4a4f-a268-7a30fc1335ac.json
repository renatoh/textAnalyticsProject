He has held a number of senior posts in a 46-year career that has included periods at the Treasury and the Bank of England. However, reflecting private equity's status as a relative upstart on the City scene, Walker has never worked in the leveraged buyout industry. Prior to joining Morgan Stanley, he was deputy chairman of Lloyds Bank and between 1988 and 1992 he was chairman of the Securities and Investments Board - a precursor of the Financial Services Authority. Walker began his financial career in 1961 at the Treasury, in a 16-year stint which included a spell on secondment at the International Monetary Fund in Washington. His next career move kept him at the heart of the establishment as he embarked on a 15-year period at the Bank of England, where he became one of four executive directors at the central bank. His lengthy spells as a public servant have perhaps influenced his recent criticisms of the private equity industry, which he said allowed itself to be viewed as \"needlessly secretive\". But in recent interviews, Walker has said he is aware of the need to preserve the industry's success and will not force through changes that are to the detriment of the private equity businesses. He has also strongly resisted calls for partners to disclose the level of their pay. Walker graduated from Queens' College, Cambridge with a double first in economics."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
