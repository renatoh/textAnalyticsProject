That referred to running costs. Any assembly, according to a recent government booklet delivered to every household, would \"directly control spending of around \u00a3500m, mostly from government grant\". In a leading article, Increase the density, page 29, October 15, we described John Prescott as a north-east MP. His constituency is Hull East, outside the north-east region. In Leaked report damns passive smoking, page 7, yesterday, we quoted the general secretary of the TUC saying: \"Half-measures will not save the 700 employers who die every year due to passive smoking at work.\" What she actually said was \"700 employees\". In a report headed Cartons consign tinned food to scrapheap, page 3, October 16, we said the new Tetra Paks were easier for the industry to distribute - \"for every 16 lorries needed for cylindrical tin cans, just one lorry is needed [for] the equivalent in rectangular cartons\". We should have explained that this is because the new paperboard packs can be taken to the factory flatpacked for filling. They also save space when filled but clearly not that much. The former Enron finance director to whom we meant to refer in Judge backs extradition of NatWest bankers, page 26, October 16, is Andrew Fastow, not Falstow. In Pastries make patsies of Eccles, page 1, October 18, we described Elizabeth Raffald as \"the owner of a confectioner's shop in Arley Hall in Cheshire\". In fact, Mrs Raffald was housekeeper at Arley Hall, a country house, before marrying the gardener and moving. It was only then that she opened a confectioner's shop and published her famous cookery book (The Experienced English Housekeeper, with \"near 800 original receipts\"). Barney Kessel, the jazz musician, who died at the age of 80 in June this year, accidentally appeared in the Birthdays column, page 25, October 16. Apologies.
