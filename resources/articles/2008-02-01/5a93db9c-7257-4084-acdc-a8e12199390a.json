Police say at least six people have been taken to hospital, with mayor Richard Hyde telling MSNBC that authorities have informed him of \"a multitude of injuries\". The explosion occurred around lunchtime on Thursday. It blew the windows out of storefronts and collapsed the ceilings above stores. Images of the Chicago-area shopping centre show a collapsed ceiling above a clothes shop, mobile phone store and a hair salon. Fire crews from several towns have come to help in rescue efforts, and are searching to see if people are trapped inside. It is not clear what caused the blast."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
