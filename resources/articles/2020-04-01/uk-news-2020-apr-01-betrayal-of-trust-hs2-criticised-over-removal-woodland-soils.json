Undertaking the controversial \u201ctranslocation\u201d operation \u2013 which also involves felling numerous trees \u2013 in six woods in April and not during winter as the high-speed railway originally said it would, was a \u201cbetrayal of trust\u201d said the charity\u2019s ecologist. The relocation of soils from the Warwickshire woodlands, including Broadwells Wood and Crackley Wood, is supposed to quicken the establishment of new woods nearby. But HS2 Ltd agreed in official plans published as part of the hybrid parliamentary bill authorising the high-speed line that it would conduct soil translocation in winter, when plants and trees are dormant, to minimise damage. \u201cEverything is growing in April. It\u2019s completely the wrong time to be doing this and HS2 know it\u2019s the wrong time to be doing this,\u201d said Luci Ryan of the Woodland Trust. There is one study of the efficacy of soil translocation in establishing new woods in Britain and Ryan said there was as yet no evidence it would be successful in the long term. She also said the contractor undertaking the translocation in Warwickshire had never performed such work before. She added: \u201cWe\u2019ve engaged with the hybrid bill process all the way through. HS2 has promised at various stages that they will do X or Y and we\u2019ve taken it in good faith. When it comes to doing the works, they\u2019ve said they are actually doing A or B. It\u2019s heartbreaking and it\u2019s a betrayal of trust. \u201cIt\u2019s a government-backed project. It should be done to the highest possible standards. If a government project is doing things wrong, what does that say to other developers?\u201d Five campaigners have spent the past week living up trees in Crackley Wood in an attempt to halt the destruction, with HS2 \u201cenabling\u201d works to continue despite the coronavirus crisis. Joe Rukin, a spokesperson for Stop HS2, claimed the destruction of bird-nest habitat was happening \u201con an industrial scale\u201d in ancient woodlands \u201cin a desperate attempt to claw back some time\u201d after delays to the \u00a3106bn railway. He added: \u201cHS2 don\u2019t seem to have noticed that the whole country is on standstill. Covid-19 has handed HS2 the opportunity to do the right thing [and delay the works] but instead HS2 have done exactly the wrong thing. They\u2019ve seen it as an opportunity to make sure no one witnesses [their actions].\u201d The naturalist Chris Packham has requested an emergency injunction to halt HS2 construction works this spring until his proposed judicial review challenging the government\u2019s decision to proceed with the railway can be heard in the high court. HS2 said it had deferred work on five ancient woodlands until winter 2020 but could not delay works on six woods, including Broadwells and Crackley. In a statement, it said the soil translocation was a \u201cbest practice approach\u201d and added: \u201cOur works programme needs to proceed as planned in order to avoid further delays and additional costs to the taxpayer \u2026 HS2 recognises the challenges of undertaking such works at this time of the year and we still feel there is value in undertaking such an approach, and will be responding to the Woodland Trust on this matter.\u201d With regards to nesting birds, HS2 said its teams would put temporary exclusion zones around all nests it discovered until the chicks were fledged. It said: \u201cHS2 Ltd contractors are keenly aware of the law around nesting birds, and during nesting season an ecologist is present during all habitat clearance work in order to spot nesting birds and stop work where necessary.\u201d HS2 said all bat roosts would be identified and inspected before work and trees would only be felled once an ecologist had confirmed no bats were present. Of the ancient woodlands affected by the railway in Warwickshire, HS2 said about 86.5% would remain intact and unaffected. For those areas of woodland that are removed, HS2 is planting 14.5 hectares of new broadleaved woodland, almost double the area affected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
