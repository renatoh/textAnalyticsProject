But \"tornado alley\" in the Great Plains of the US is not the only place to see a tornado: surprisingly the UK has the most tornadoes per unit area in the world, with around 30 tornadoes recorded every year. Most British tornadoes are not as dramatic as their US counterparts, usually doing no more than whipping a few tiles off a roof. But occasionally they pack a punch. The largest tornado known in the UK is also the earliest. On 17 October 1091 (23 October when adjusted to today's Gregorian calendar) London was hit by a vicious tornado. Historical records tell of the wooden London Bridge being demolished, along with 600 houses (mostly wooden). Furthermore, the church of St Mary-le-Bow, in the city of London, was smashed to pieces, with four rafters driven more than six metres into the ground. Two men are reported to have lost their lives. Judging by the accounts of the damage, meteorologists have assigned the 1091 tornado T8 (severely devastating) status on the tornado scale (which runs from T0 to T10). Wind speeds would have been up to 240mph (385km/h). If such a tornado were to hit London today we could expect to see cars hurled along the street, houses smashed and skyscrapers twisted. Luckily T8 tornadoes are rare in the UK \u2013 and let's hope it stays that way."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
