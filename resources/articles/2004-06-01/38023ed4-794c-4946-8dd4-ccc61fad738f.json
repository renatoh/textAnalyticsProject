Birch's appointment in place of Michael Dunford comes as part of a reshuffle in the boardroom, with the owner Bill Kenwright replacing Sir Philip Carter - who has been made life president - as chairman. Although Birch will attempt to attract new investment, he admitted that a move from Everton's home of 112 years and a ground-share with Liverpool might be the best option. \"If Everton do not find a ground, or share one which gives them the access to that additional revenue, it is unlikely they will be a big club again in the near future,\" he said. \"You have to keep an open mind, if that is the only alternative to Everton generating further revenue. \"There are a lot of clubs out there who are suffering, but if you look at the clubs who have been successful in the recent past it has been due to the level of finance that has been avail able to them. That tends to be generated by a very good stadium.\" The France midfielder Beno\u00eet Pedretti has left Sochaux for Marseille in a \u00a33.3m deal. \"I want to win something with the club of my dreams,\" said the 23-year-old, who signed a four-year contract with the Uefa Cup finalists. \"I wanted everything to be settled before Euro 2004.\" The Swiss coach K\u00f6bi Kuhn is facing a selection headache before today's deadline to name his final Euro 2004 squad. Switzerland, who play Germany in a friendly in Basel tonight, were dealt a double blow at the weekend when the strikers Marco Streller and Leonard Thurre were injured in training. Streller broke his leg and will be out for six months, and the Swiss team doctor Roland Grossen said yesterday that Thurre was unlikely to return from a torn calf muscle in time to play in Portugal. \"The team I name for the match against Germany will be more or less the same side that I want to put out against Croatia,\" Kuhn said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
